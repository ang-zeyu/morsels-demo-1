Constantinople and Naples, Bombay and San Francisco, cannot boast of  more perfect or more varied prospects. There are some fine pieces of  wood and water scenery along the south coast of Cape Colony, and one of  singular charm in the adjoining colony of Natal, where the suburbs of  Durban, the principal port, though they lack the grandeur which its  craggy heights give to the neighbourhood of Cape Town have, with a  warmer climate, a richer and more tropically luxuriant vegetation. In  the great range of mountains which runs some seventeen hundred miles  from Cape Town almost to the banks of the Zambesi, the scenery becomes  striking in three districts only. One of these is Basutoland, a little  native territory which lies just where Cape Colony, the Orange Free  State, and Natal meet. Its peaks are the highest in Africa south of  Mount Kilimanjaro, for several of them reach 11,000 feet. On the  south-east this mountain-land, the Switzerland of South Africa, faces  Natal and East Griqualand with a long range of formidable precipices,  impassable for many miles. The interior contains valleys and glens of  singular beauty, some wild and rugged, some clothed with rich pasture.  The voice of brooks, a sound rare in Africa, rises from the hidden  depths of the gorges, and here and there torrents plunging over the edge  of a basaltic cliff into an abyss below make waterfalls which are at all  seasons beautiful, and when swollen by the rains of January majestic.  Except wood, of which there is unhappily nothing more than a little  scrubby bush in the sheltered hollows, nearly all the elements of beauty  are present; and the contrast between the craggy summits and the soft  rich pasture and cornlands which lie along their northern base, gives  rise to many admirable landscapes.    Two hundred miles north-north-east of Basutoland the great Quathlamba  Range rises in very bold slopes from the coast levels behind Delagoa  Bay, and the scenery of the valleys and passes is said to be extremely  grand. Knowing it, however, only by report, I will not venture to  describe it. Nearly five hundred miles still farther to the north, in  the district called Manicaland, already referred to, is a third mountain  region, less lofty than Basutoland, but deriving a singular charm from  the dignity and variety of its mountain forms. The whole country is so  elevated that summits of 7000 or even 8000 feet do not produce any  greater effect upon the eye than does Ben Lomond as seen from Loch  Lomond, or Mount Washington from the Glen House. But there is a boldness  of line about these granite peaks comparable to those of the west coast  of Norway or of the finest parts of the Swiss Alps. Some of them rise in  smooth shafts of apparently inaccessible rock; others form long ridges  of pinnacles of every kind of shape, specially striking when they stand  out against the brilliantly clear morning or evening sky. The valleys  are well wooded, the lower slopes covered with herbage, so the effect of  these wild peaks is heightened by the softness of the surroundings which  they dominate, while at the same time the whole landscape becomes more  complex and more noble by the mingling of such diverse elements. No  scenery better deserves the name of romantic. And even in the tamer  parts, where instead of mountains there are only low hills, or \"kopjes\"  (as they are called in South Africa), the slightly more friable rock  found in these hills decomposes under the influence of the weather into  curiously picturesque and fantastic forms, with crags riven to their  base, and detached pillars supporting loose blocks and tabular masses,  among or upon which the timid Mashonas have built their huts in the hope  of escaping the raids of their warlike enemies, the Matabili.    Though I must admit that South Africa, taken as a whole, offers far less  to attract the lover of natural beauty than does Southern or Western  Europe or the Pacific States of North America, there are two kinds of  charm which it possesses in a high degree. One is that of colour.  Monotonous as the landscapes often are, there is a warmth and richness  of tone about them which fills and delights the eye. One sees  comparatively little of that whitish-blue limestone which so often gives  a hard and chilling aspect to the scenery of the lower ridges of the  Alps and of large parts of the coasts of the Mediterranean. In Africa  even the grey granite or gneiss has a deeper tone than these limestones,  and it is frequently covered by red and yellow lichens of wonderful  beauty. The dark basalts and porphyries which occur in many places, the  rich red tint which the surface of the sandstone rocks often takes under  the scorching sun, give depth of tone to the landscape; and though the  flood of midday sunshine is almost overpowering, the lights of morning  and evening, touching the mountains with every shade of rose and crimson  and violet, are indescribably beautiful. It is in these morning and  evening hours that the charm of the pure dry air is specially felt.  Mountains fifty or sixty miles away stand out clearly enough to enable  all the wealth of their colour and all the delicacy of their outlines to  be perceived; and the eye realises, by the exquisitely fine change of  tint between the nearer and the more distant ranges, the immensity and  the harmony of the landscape. Europeans may think that the continuous  profusion of sunlight during most of the year may become wearisome. I  was not long enough in the country to find it so, and I observed that  those who have lived for a few years in South Africa declare they prefer  that continuous profusion to the murky skies of Britain or Holland or  North Germany. But even if the fine weather which prevails for eight  months in the year be monotonous, there is compensation in the  extraordinary brilliancy of the atmospheric effects throughout the rainy  season, and especially in its first weeks. During nine days which I  spent in the Transvaal at that season, when several thunderstorms  occurred almost every day, the combinations of sunshine, lightning, and  cloud, and the symphonies--if the expression may be permitted--of light  and shade and colour which their changeful play produced in the sky and  on the earth, were more various and more wonderful than a whole year  would furnish forth for enjoyment in Europe.    The other peculiar charm which South African scenery possesses is that  of primeval solitude and silence. It is a charm which is differently  felt by different minds. There are many who find the presence of what  Homer calls \"the rich works of men\" essential to the perfection of a  landscape. Cultivated fields, gardens, and orchards, farmhouses dotted  here and there, indications in one form or another of human life and  labour, do not merely give a greater variety to every prospect, but also  impart an element which evokes the sense of sympathy with our  fellow-beings, and excites a whole group of emotions which the  contemplation of nature, taken by itself, does not arouse. No one is  insensible to these things and some find little delight in any scene  from which they are absent. Yet there are other minds to which there is  something specially solemn and impressive in the untouched and primitive  simplicity of a country which stands now just as it came from the hands  of the Creator. The self-sufficingness of nature, the insignificance of  man, the mystery of a universe which does not exist, as our ancestors  fondly thought, for the sake of man, but for other purposes hidden from  us and for ever undiscoverable--these things are more fully realised and  more deeply felt when one traverses a boundless wilderness which seems  to have known no change since the remote ages when hill and plain and  valley were moulded into the forms we see to-day. Feelings of this kind  powerfully affect the mind of the traveller in South Africa. They affect  him in the Karroo, where the slender line of rails, along which his  train creeps all day and all night across wide stretches of brown desert  and under the crests of stern dark hills, seems to heighten by contrast  the sense of solitude--a vast and barren solitude interposed between the  busy haunts of men which he has left behind on the shores of the ocean  and those still busier haunts whither he is bent, where the pick and  hammer sound upon the Witwatersrand, and the palpitating engine drags  masses of ore from the depths of the crowded mine. They affect him still  more in the breezy highlands of Matabililand, where the eye ranges over  an apparently endless succession of undulations clothed with tall grass  or waving wood, till they sink in the blue distance toward the plain  through which the great Zambesi takes its seaward course.    The wilderness is indeed not wholly unpeopled. Over the wide surface of  Matabililand and Mashonaland--an area of some two hundred thousand  square miles--there are scattered natives of various tribes, whose  numbers have been roughly estimated at from 250,000 to 400,000 persons.  But one rarely sees a native except along a few well-beaten tracks, and  still more rarely comes upon a cluster of huts in the woods along the  streamlets or half hidden among the fissured rocks of a granite kopje.  The chief traces of man's presence in the landscape are the narrow and  winding footpaths which run hither and thither through the country, and  bewilder the traveller who, having strayed from his waggon, vainly hopes  by following them to find his way back to the main track, or the wreaths  of blue smoke which indicate the spot where a Kafir has set the grass on  fire to startle and kill the tiny creatures that dwell in it.

The thing wot you open ginger-ile with.\"    \"Oh, you mean the thing? It's in the middle drawer of the dresser.  Use your eyes, my boy!\"    \"Wri'\".    George gave an overwrought sigh and began the letter again.        \"DEAR MR. BEVAN,          \"Thank you ever so much for your note which Albert gave      to me. How very, very kind of you to come here like this and      to say that you would help me. And how clever of you to      find me after I was so secretive that day in the cab!  You      really can help me, if you are willing. It's too long to      explain in a note, but I am in great trouble, and there is      nobody except you to help me. I will explain everything      when I see you. The difficulty will be to slip away from      home. They are watching me every moment, I'm afraid. But I      will try my hardest to see you very soon.                       Yours sincerely,                         \"MAUD MARSH.\"    Just for a moment it must be confessed, the tone of the letter  damped George. He could not have said just what he had expected,  but certainly Reggie's revelations had prepared him for something  rather warmer, something more in the style in which a girl would  write to the man she loved. The next moment, however, he saw how  foolish any such expectation had been. How on earth could any  reasonable man expect a girl to let herself go at this stage of the  proceedings? It was for him to make the first move. Naturally she  wasn't going to reveal her feelings until he had revealed his.    George raised the letter to his lips and kissed it vigorously.    \"Hey, mister!\"    George started guiltily. The blush of shame overspread his cheeks.  The room seemed to echo with the sound of that fatuous kiss.    \"Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!\" he called, snapping his fingers, and  repeating the incriminating noise. \"I was just calling my cat,\" he  explained with dignity. \"You didn't see her in there, did you?\"    Albert's blue eyes met his in a derisive stare. The lid of the left  one fluttered. It was but too plain that Albert was not convinced.    \"A little black cat with white shirt-front,\" babbled George  perseveringly. \"She's usually either here or there, or--or  somewhere. Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!\"    The cupid's bow of Albert's mouth parted. He uttered one word.    \"Swank!\"    There was a tense silence. What Albert was thinking one cannot say.  The thoughts of Youth are long, long thoughts. What George was  thinking was that the late King Herod had been unjustly blamed for  a policy which had been both statesmanlike and in the interests of  the public. He was blaming the mawkish sentimentality of the modern  legal system which ranks the evisceration and secret burial of  small boys as a crime.    \"What do you mean?\"    \"You know what I mean.\"    \"I've a good mind to--\"    Albert waved a deprecating hand.    \"It's all right, mister. I'm yer friend.\"    \"You are, are you? Well, don't let it about. I've got a reputation  to keep up.\"    \"I'm yer friend, I tell you. I can help yer. I want to help yer!\"    George's views on infanticide underwent a slight modification.  After all, he felt, much must be excused to Youth. Youth thinks it  funny to see a man kissing a letter. It is not funny, of course; it  is beautiful; but it's no good arguing the point. Let Youth have  its snigger, provided, after it has finished sniggering, it intends  to buckle to and be of practical assistance. Albert, as an ally,  was not to be despised. George did not know what Albert's duties as  a page-boy were, but they seemed to be of a nature that gave him  plenty of leisure and freedom; and a friendly resident of the  castle with leisure and freedom was just what he needed.    \"That's very good of you,\" he said, twisting his reluctant  features into a fairly benevolent smile.    \"I can 'elp!\" persisted Albert. \"Got a cigaroot?\"    \"Do you smoke, child?\"    \"When I get 'old of a cigaroot I do.\"    \"I'm sorry I can't oblige you. I don't smoke cigarettes.\"    \"Then I'll 'ave to 'ave one of my own,\" said Albert moodily.    He reached into the mysteries of his pocket and produced a piece of  string, a knife, the wishbone of a fowl, two marbles, a crushed  cigarette, and a match. Replacing the string, the knife, the  wishbone and the marbles, he ignited the match against the tightest  part of his person and lit the cigarette.    \"I can help yer. I know the ropes.\"    \"And smoke them,\" said George, wincing.    \"Pardon?\"    \"Nothing.\"    Albert took an enjoyable whiff.    \"I know all about yer.\"    \"You do?\"    \"You and Lidy Mord.\"    \"Oh, you do, do you?\"    \"I was listening at the key-'ole while the row was goin' on.\"    \"There was a row, was there?\"    A faint smile of retrospective enjoyment lit up Albert's face. \"An  orful row! Shoutin' and yellin' and cussin' all over the shop.  About you and Lidy Maud.\"    \"And you drank it in, eh?\"    \"Pardon?\"    \"I say, you listened?\"    \"Not 'arf I listened. Seeing I'd just drawn you in the sweepstike,  of course, I listened--not 'arf!\"    George did not follow him here.    \"The sweepstike? What's a sweepstike?\"    \"Why, a thing you puts names in 'ats and draw 'em and the  one that gets the winning name wins the money.\"    \"Oh, you mean a sweepstake!\"    \"That's wot I said--a sweepstike.\"    George was still puzzled.    \"But I don't understand. How do you mean you drew me in a  sweepstike--I mean a sweepstake? What sweepstake?\"    \"Down in the servants' 'all. Keggs, the butler, started it. I  'eard 'im say he always 'ad one every place 'e was in as a butler--  leastways, whenever there was any dorters of the 'ouse. There's  always a chance, when there's a 'ouse-party, of one of the dorters  of the 'ouse gettin' married to one of the gents in the party, so  Keggs 'e puts all of the gents' names in an 'at, and you pay five  shillings for a chance, and the one that draws the winning name  gets the money. And if the dorter of the 'ouse don't get married  that time, the money's put away and added to the pool for the next  'ouse-party.\"    George gasped. This revelation of life below stairs in the stately  homes of England took his breath away. Then astonishment gave way to  indignation.    \"Do you mean to tell me that you--you worms--made Lady Maud  the--the prize of a sweepstake!\"    Albert was hurt.    \"Who're yer calling worms?\"    George perceived the need of diplomacy. After all much depended on  this child's goodwill.    \"I was referring to the butler--what's his name--Keggs.\"    \"'E ain't a worm. 'E's a serpint.\" Albert drew at his cigarette.  His brow darkened. \"'E does the drawing, Keggs does, and I'd like  to know 'ow it is 'e always manages to cop the fav'rit!\"    Albert chuckled.    \"But this time I done him proper. 'E didn't want me in the thing at  all. Said I was too young. Tried to do the drawin' without me.  'Clip that boy one side of the 'ead!' 'e says, 'and turn 'im out!'  'e says. I says, 'Yus, you will!' I says. 'And wot price me goin'  to 'is lordship and blowing the gaff?' I says. 'E says, 'Oh, orl  right!' 'e says. 'Ave it yer own way!' 'e says.    \"'Where's yer five shillings?' 'e says. ''Ere yer are!' I says.  'Oh, very well,' 'e says. 'But you'll 'ave to draw last,' 'e says,  'bein' the youngest.' Well, they started drawing the names,  and of course Keggs 'as to draw Mr. Byng.\"    \"Oh, he drew Mr. Byng, did he?\"    \"Yus. And everyone knew Reggie was the fav'rit. Smiled all over his  fat face, the old serpint did! And when it come to my turn, 'e says  to me, 'Sorry, Elbert!' 'e says, 'but there ain't no more names.  They've give out!' 'Oh, they 'ave, 'ave they?' I says, 'Well, wot's  the matter with giving a fellow a sporting chance?' I says. 'Ow do  you mean?' 'e says. 'Why, write me out a ticket marked \"Mr. X.\",' I  says. 'Then, if 'er lidyship marries anyone not in the 'ouse-party,  I cop!' 'Orl right,' 'e says, 'but you know the conditions of this  'ere sweep. Nothin' don't count only wot tikes plice during the two  weeks of the 'ouse-party,' 'e says. 'Orl right,' I says. 'Write me  ticket. It's a fair sportin' venture.' So 'e writes me out me  ticket, with 'Mr. X.' on it, and I says to them all, I says, 'I'd  like to 'ave witnesses', I says, 'to this 'ere thing. Do all you  gents agree that if anyone not in the 'ouse-party and 'oo's name  ain't on one of the other tickets marries 'er lidyship, I get the  pool?' I says. They all says that's right, and then I says to 'em  all straight out, I says, 'I 'appen to know', I says, 'that 'er  lidyship is in love with a gent that's not in the party at all. An  American gent,' I says. They wouldn't believe it at first, but,  when Keggs 'ad put two and two together, and thought of one or two  things that 'ad 'appened, 'e turned as white as a sheet and said it  was a swindle and wanted the drawin' done over again, but the  others says 'No', they says, 'it's quite fair,' they says, and one  of 'em offered me ten bob slap out for my ticket. But I stuck to  it, I did. And that,\" concluded Albert throwing the cigarette into  the fire-place just in time to prevent a scorched finger, \"that's  why I'm going to 'elp yer!\"    There is probably no attitude of mind harder for the average man to  maintain than that of aloof disapproval. George was an average man,  and during the degrading recital just concluded he had found  himself slipping. At first he had been revolted, then, in spite of  himself, amused, and now, when all the facts were before him, he  could induce his mind to think of nothing else than his good  fortune in securing as an ally one who appeared to combine a  precocious intelligence with a helpful lack of scruple. War is war,  and love is love, and in each the practical man inclines to demand  from his fellow-workers the punch rather than a lofty soul. A page  boy replete with the finer feelings would have been useless in this  crisis. Albert, who seemed, on the"]]]
