[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2439"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II â€” Volume 2 (#19)"],[1," the present King  had published. Compton, the Bishop of London, received orders from  Sunderland to suspend Sharp till the royal pleasure should be further  known. The Bishop was in great perplexity. His recent conduct in the  House of Lords had given deep offence to the court. Already his name had  been struck out of the list of Privy Councillors. Already he had been  dismissed from his office in the royal chapel. He was unwilling to give  fresh provocation but the act which he was directed to perform was a  judicial act. He felt that it was unjust, and he was assured by the best  advisers that it was also illegal, to inflict punishment without giving  any opportunity for defence. He accordingly, in the humblest terms,  represented his difficulties to the King, and privately requested  Sharp not to appear in the pulpit for the present. Reasonable as were  Compton's scruples, obsequious as were his apologies, James was greatly  incensed. What insolence to plead either natural justice or positive  law in opposition to an express command of the Sovereign Sharp was  forgotten. The Bishop became a mark for the whole vengeance of the  government. [96] The King felt more painfully than ever the want of that  tremendous engine which had once coerced refractory ecclesiastics. He  probably knew that, for a few angry words uttered against his father's  government, Bishop Williams had been suspended by the High Commission  from all ecclesiastical dignities and functions. The design of reviving  that formidable tribunal was pushed on more eagerly than ever. In July  London was alarmed by the news that the King had, in direct defiance of  two acts of Parliament drawn in the strongest terms, entrusted the whole  government of the Church to seven Commissioners. [97] The words in which  the jurisdiction of these officers was described were loose, and might  be stretched to almost any extent. All colleges and grammar schools,  even those founded by the liberality of private benefactors, were placed  under the authority of the new board. All who depended for bread on  situations in the Church or in academical institutions, from the Primate  down to the youngest curate, from the Vicechancellors of Oxford and  Cambridge down to the humblest pedagogue who taught Corderius, were at  the royal mercy. If any one of those many thousands was suspected  of doing or saying anything distasteful to the government, the  Commissioners might cite him before them. In their mode of dealing  with him they were fettered by no rules. They were themselves at once  prosecutors and judges. The accused party was furnished with no copy of  the charge. He was examined and crossexamined. If his answers did not  give satisfaction, he was liable to be suspended from his office, to be  ejected from it, to be pronounced incapable of holding any preferment  in future. If he were contumacious, he might be excommunicated, or, in  other words, be deprived of all civil rights and imprisoned for life. He  might also, at the discretion of the court, be loaded with all the costs  of the proceeding by which he had been reduced to beggary. No appeal  was given. The Commissioners were directed to execute their office  notwithstanding any law which might be, or might seem to be,  inconsistent with these regulations. Lastly, lest any person should  doubt that it was intended to revive that terrible court from which the  Long Parliament had freed the nation, the new tribunal was directed to  use a seal bearing exactly the same device and the same superscription  with the seal of the old High Commission. [98]    The chief Commissioner was the Chancellor. His presence and assent were  necessary to every proceeding. All men knew how unjustly, insolently,  and barbarously he had acted in courts where he had been, to a certain  extent, restrained by the known laws of England. It was, therefore,  not difficult to foresee how he would conduct himself in a situation in  which he was at entire liberty to make forms of procedure and rules of  evidence for himself.    Of the other six Commissioners three were prelates and three laymen. The  name of Archbishop Sancroft stood first. But he was fully convinced that  the court was illegal, that all its judgments would be null, and that  by sitting in it he should incur a serious responsibility. He therefore  determined not to comply with the royal mandate. He did not, however,  act on this occasion with that courage and sincerity which he showed  when driven to extremity two years later. He begged to be excused on  the plea of business and ill health. The other members of the board,  he added, were men of too much ability to need his assistance. These  disingenuous apologies ill became the Primate of all England at such a  crisis; nor did they avert the royal displeasure. Sancroft's name was  not indeed struck out of the list of Privy Councillors: but, to the  bitter mortification of the friends of the Church, he was no longer  summoned on Council days. \"If,\" said the King, \"he is too sick or too  busy to go to the Commission, it is a kindness to relieve him from  attendance at Council.\" [99]    The government found no similar difficulty with Nathaniel Crewe, Bishop  of the great and opulent see of Durham, a man nobly born, and raised so  high in his profession that he could scarcely wish to rise higher, but  mean, vain, and cowardly. He had been made Dean of the Chapel Royal when  the Bishop of London was banished from the palace. The honour of being  an Ecclesiastical Commissioner turned Crewe's head. It was to no purpose  that some of his friends represented to him the risk which he ran by  sitting in an illegal tribunal. He was not ashamed to answer that he  could not live out of the royal smile, and exultingly expressed his  hope that his name would appear in history, a hope which has not been  altogether disappointed. [100]    Thomas Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, was the third clerical Commissioner.  He was a man to whose talents posterity has scarcely done justice.  Unhappily for his fame, it has been usual to print his verses in  collections of the British poets; and those who judge of him by his  verses must consider him as a servile imitator, who, without one spark  of Cowley's admirable genius, mimicked whatever was least commendable  in Cowley's manner: but those who are acquainted with Sprat's prose  writings will form a very different estimate of his powers. He was  indeed a great master of our language, and possessed at once the  eloquence of the orator, of the controversialist, and of the historian.  His moral character might have passed with little censure had he  belonged to a less sacred profession; for the worst that can be said of  him is that he was indolent, luxurious, and worldly: but such failings,  though not commonly regarded as very heinous in men of secular callings,  are scandalous in a prelate. The Archbishopric of York was vacant; Sprat  hoped to obtain it, and therefore accepted a seat at the ecclesiastical  board: but he was too goodnatured a man to behave harshly; and he was  too sensible a man not to know that he might at some future time be  called to a serious account by a Parliament. He therefore, though he  consented to act, tried to do as little mischief, and to make as few  enemies, as possible. [101]    The three remaining Commissioners were the Lord Treasurer, the Lord  President, and the Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Rochester,  disapproving and murmuring, consented to serve. Much as he had to endure  at the court, he could not bear to quit it. Much as he loved the Church,  he could not bring himself to sacrifice for her sake his white staff,  his patronage, his salary of eight thousand pounds a year, and the far  larger indirect emoluments of his office. He excused his conduct to  others, and perhaps to himself, by pleading that, as a Commissioner, he  might be able to prevent much evil, and that, if he refused to act,  some person less attached to the Protestant religion would be found to  replace him. Sunderland was the representative of the Jesuitical cabal.  Herbert's recent decision on the question of the dispensing power seemed  to prove that he would not flinch from any service which the King might  require.    As soon as the Commission had been opened, the Bishop of London was  cited before the new tribunal. He appeared. \"I demand of you,\" said  Jeffreys, \"a direct and positive answer. Why did not you suspend Dr.  Sharp?\"    The Bishop requested a copy of the Commission in order that he might  know by what authority he was thus interrogated. \"If you mean,\" said  Jeffreys, \"to dispute our authority, I shall take another course with  you. As to the Commission, I do not doubt that you have seen it. At all  events you may see it in any coffeehouse for a penny.\" The insolence of  the Chancellor's reply appears to have shocked the other Commissioners,  and he was forced to make some awkward apologies. He then returned to  the point from which he had started. \"This,\" he said, \"is not a court in  which written charges are exhibited. Our proceedings are summary, and  by word of mouth. The question is a plain one. Why did you not obey  the King?\" With some difficulty Compton obtained a brief delay, and the  assistance of counsel. When the case had been heard, it was evident  to all men that the Bishop had done only what he was bound to do. The  Treasurer, the Chief Justice, and Sprat were for acquittal. The King's  wrath was moved. It seemed that his Ecclesiastical Commission would fail  him as his Tory Parliament had failed him. He offered Rochester a  simple choice, to pronounce the Bishop guilty, or to quit the Treasury.  Rochester was base enough to yield. Compton was suspended from all  spiritual functions; and the charge of his great diocese was committed  to his judges, Sprat and Crewe. He continued, however, to reside in  his palace and to receive his revenues; for it was known"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#19)"],[1," before the  farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on  the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier  looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at  his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face  upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.    So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with  his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first  thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying  man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the  hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the  house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the  astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson  Hope.    \"Good God!\" gasped John Ferrier. \"How you scared me! Whatever made you  come in like that.\"    \"Give me food,\" the other said, hoarsely. \"I have had no time for bite  or sup for eight-and-forty hours.\" He flung himself upon the [21] cold  meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's  supper, and devoured it voraciously. \"Does Lucy bear up well?\" he asked,  when he had satisfied his hunger.    \"Yes. She does not know the danger,\" her father answered.    \"That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled  my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not quite sharp  enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\"    John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had  a devoted ally. He seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it  cordially. \"You're a man to be proud of,\" he said. \"There are not many  who would come to share our danger and our troubles.\"    \"You've hit it there, pard,\" the young hunter answered. \"I have a  respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think twice  before I put my head into such a hornet's nest. It's Lucy that brings me  here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o' the  Hope family in Utah.\"    \"What are we to do?\"    \"To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.  I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money  have you?\"    \"Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\"    \"That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson  City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that  the servants do not sleep in the house.\"    While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching  journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into  a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by  experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had  hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his  daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the  lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was  much to be done.    \"We must make our start at once,\" said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low  but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril,  but has steeled his heart to meet it. \"The front and back entrances are  watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and  across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the  Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way  through the mountains.\"    \"What if we are stopped,\" asked Ferrier.    Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his  tunic. \"If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them  with us,\" he said with a sinister smile.    The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the  darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,  and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved  himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and  happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.  All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad  silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that  the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set  expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house  he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.    Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty  provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few  of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and  carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the  night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With  bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained  the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap  which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when  the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the  shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.    It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the  ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the  melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards  of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small  distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the  gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry  again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.    \"To-morrow at midnight,\" said the first who appeared to be in authority.  \"When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\"    \"It is well,\" returned the other. \"Shall I tell Brother Drebber?\"    \"Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\"    \"Seven to five!\" repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away  in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some  form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died  away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his  companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top  of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength  appeared to fail her.    \"Hurry on! hurry on!\" he gasped from time to time. \"We are through the  line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\"    Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they  meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid  recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a  rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged  peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led  between them was the Eagle Canon in which the horses were awaiting them.  With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great  boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to  the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had  been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon  one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the  other along the precipitous and dangerous path.    It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face  Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a  thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic  columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.  On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance  impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places  that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised  riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and  difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them,  for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible  despotism from which they were flying.    They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the  jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most  desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and  pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark  and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them  as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \"Who goes  there?\" rang through the silent ravine.    \"Travellers for Nevada,\" said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the  rifle which hung by his saddle.    They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at  them as if dissatisfied at their reply.    \"By whose permission?\" he asked.    \"The Holy Four,\" answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him  that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.    \"Nine from seven,\" cried the sentinel.    \"Seven from five,\" returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the  countersign which he had heard in the garden.    \"Pass, and the Lord go with you,\" said the voice from above. Beyond his  post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a  trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon  his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen  people, and that freedom lay before them.          CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS.      ALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular  and rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope's  intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track  once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage  beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks  hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon.  So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch  and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads,"]]]
