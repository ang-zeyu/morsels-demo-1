May heaven punish whoever       wrongs you! and may it be as favorable to you, sir, as I wish!         ORG. (_aside to_ CLEANTE). This pleasant beginning agrees with my       conjectures, and argues some sort of reconciliation.         LOY. All your family was always dear to me, and I served your       father.         ORG. Sir, I am sorry and ashamed to say that I do not know who you       are, neither do I remember your name.         LOY. My name is Loyal; I was born in Normandy, and am a royal       bailiff in spite of envy. For the last forty years I have had the       good fortune to fill the office, thanks to Heaven, with great       credit; and I come, sir, with your leave, to serve you the writ of       a certain order.         ORG. What! you are here--         LOY. Gently, sir, I beg. It is merely a summons,--a notice for you       to leave this place, you and yours; to take away all your goods and       chattels, and make room for others, without delay or adjournment,       as hereby decreed.         ORG. I! leave this place?         LOY. Yes, sir; if you please. The house incontestably belongs, as       you are well aware, to the good Mr. Tartuffe. He is now lord and       master of your estates, according to a deed I have in my keeping.       It is in due form, and cannot be challenged.         DAMIS (_to_ MR. LOYAL). This great impudence is, indeed, worthy of       all admiration.         LOY. (_to_ DAMIS). Sir, I have nothing at all to do with you.       (_Pointing to_ ORGON.) My business is with this gentleman. He is       tractable and gentle, and knows too well the duty of a gentleman to       try to oppose authority.         ORG. But--         LOY. Yes, sir: I know that you would not, for any thing, show       contumacy; and that you will allow me, like a reasonable man, to       execute the orders I have received....    The scene gives in conclusion some spirited by-play of asides and  interruptions from indignant members of the family. Then follows scene  fifth, one exchange of conversation from which will sufficiently  indicate the progress of the plot:--         ORG. Well, mother, you see whether I am right; and you can judge of       the rest by the writ. Do you at last acknowledge his rascality?         PER. I am thunderstruck, and can scarcely believe my eyes and ears.    The next scene introduces Valere, the noble lover of that daughter whom  the infatuated father was bent on sacrificing to Tartuffe. Valere comes  to announce that Tartuffe, the villain, has accused Orgon to the king.  Orgon must fly. Valere offers him his own carriage and money,--will, in  fact, himself keep him company till he reaches a place of safety. As  Orgon, taking hasty leave of his family, turns to go, he is encountered  by--the following scene will show whom:--         TAR. (_stopping_ ORGON). Gently, sir, gently; not so fast, I beg.       You have not far to go to find a lodging, and you are a prisoner in       the king's name.         ORG. Wretch! you had reserved this shaft for the last; by it you       finish me, and crown all your perfidies.         TAR. Your abuse has no power to disturb me, and I know how to       suffer every thing for the sake of Heaven.         CLE. Your moderation is really great, we must acknowledge.         DA. How impudently the infamous wretch sports with Heaven!         TAR. Your anger cannot move me. I have no other wish but to fulfil       my duty.         MARIANNE. You may claim great glory from the performance of this       duty: it is a very honorable employment for you.         TAR. The employment cannot be otherwise than glorious, when it       comes from the power that sends me here.         ORG. But do you remember that my charitable hand, ungrateful       scoundrel, raised you from a state of misery?         TAR. Yes, I know what help I have received from you; but the       interest of my king is my first duty. The just obligation of this       sacred duty stifles in my heart all other claims; and I would       sacrifice to it friend, wife, relations, and myself with them.         ELMIRE. The impostor!         DOR. With what treacherous cunning he makes a cloak of all that men       revere!...         TAR. (_to the_ OFFICER). I beg of you, sir, to deliver me from all       this noise, and to act according to the orders you have received.         OFFICER. I have certainly put off too long the discharge of my       duty, and you very rightly remind me of it. To execute my order,       follow me immediately to the prison in which a place is assigned to       you.         TAR. Who? I, sir?         OFFICER. Yes, you.         TAR. Why to prison?         OFFICER. To you I have no account to render. (_To_ ORGON.) Pray,       sir, recover from your great alarm. We live under a king [Louis       XIV.] who is an enemy to fraud,--a king who can read the heart, and       whom all the arts of impostors cannot deceive. His great mind,       endowed with delicate discernment, at all times sees things in       their true, light.... He annuls, by his sovereign will, the terms       of the contract by which you gave him [Tartuffe] your property. He       moreover forgives you this secret offence in which you were       involved by the flight of your friend. This to reward the zeal       which you once showed for him in maintaining his rights, and to       prove that his heart, when it is least expected, knows how to       recompense a good action. Merit with him is never lost, and he       remembers good better than evil.         DOR. Heaven be thanked!         PER. Ah! I breathe again.         EL. What a favorable end to our troubles!         MAR. Who would have foretold it?         ORG. (to TARTUFFE, _as the_ OFFICER _leads him off_). Ah, wretch!       now you  are--    Tartuffe thus disposed of, the play promptly ends, with a vanishing  glimpse afforded us of a happy marriage in prospect for Valere with the  daughter.    Moliere is said to have had a personal aim in drawing the character of  Tartuffe. This, at least, was like Dante. There is not much sweet  laughter in such a comedy. But there is a power that is dreadful.    Each succeeding generation of Frenchmen supplies its bright and  ingenious wits who produce comedy. But as there is no second Shakspeare,  so there is but one Moliere.          VIII.    PASCAL.    1623-1662.      Pascal's fame is distinctly the fame of a man of genius. He achieved  notable things. But it is what he might have done, still more than what  he did, that fixes his estimation in the world of mind. Blaise Pascal is  one of the chief intellectual glories of France.    Pascal, the boy, had a strong natural bent toward mathematics. The story  is that his father, in order to turn his son's whole force on the study  of languages, put out of the lad's reach all books treating his favorite  subject. Thus shut up to his own resources, the masterful little fellow,  about his eighth year, drawing charcoal diagrams on the floor, made  perceptible progress in working out geometry for himself. At sixteen he  produced a treatise on conic sections that excited the wonder and  incredulity of Descartes. Later, he experimented in barometry, and  pursued investigations in mechanics. Later still, he made what seemed to  be approaches toward Newton's binomial theorem.    Vivid religious convictions meantime deeply affected Pascal's mind. His  health, never robust, began to give way. His physicians prescribed  mental diversion, and forced him into society. That medicine, taken at  first with reluctance, proved dangerously delightful to Pascal's  vivacious and susceptible spirit. His pious sister Jacqueline warned her  brother that he was going too far. But he was still more effectively  warned by an accident, in which he almost miraculously escaped from  death. Withdrawing from the world, he adopted a course of ascetic  practices, in which he continued till he died--in his thirty-ninth year.  He wore about his waist an iron girdle armed with sharp points; and this  he would press smartly with his elbow when he detected himself at fault  in his spirit.    Notwithstanding what Pascal did or attempted, worthy of fame, in  science, it was his fortune to become chiefly renowned by literary  achievement. His, in fact, would now be a half-forgotten name if he had  not written the \"Provincial Letters\" and the \"Thoughts.\"    The \"Provincial Letters\" is an abbreviated title. The title in full  originally was, \"Letters written by Louis de Montalte to a Provincial,  one of his friends, and to the Reverend Fathers, the Jesuits, on the  subject of the morality and the policy of those Fathers.\"    Of the \"Provincial Letters,\" several English translations have been  made. No one of these that we have been able to find, seems entirely  satisfactory. There is an elusive quality to Pascal's style, and in  losing this you seem to lose something of Pascal's thought. For with  Pascal the thought and the style penetrate each other inextricably and  almost indistinguishably. You cannot print a smile, an inflection of the  voice, a glance of the eye, a French shrug of the shoulders. And such  modulations of the thought seem everywhere to lurk in the turns and  phrases of Pascal's inimitable French. To translate them is impossible.    Pascal is beyond question the greatest modern master of that  indescribably delicate art in expression, which, from its illustrious  ancient exemplar, has received the name of the Socratic irony. With this  fine weapon, in great part, it was, wielded like a magician's invisible  wand, that Pascal did his memorable execution on the Jesuitical system  of morals and casuistry, in the \"Provincial "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#19)"],[1,"in de swamp,  en I steer'd cle'r an' er.

Monday mawnin' he'd git on a spree, en all dat week he'd be on a  spree, en de nex' Monday mawnin' he'd take a fresh start. Bimeby,  one day, atter de blacksmif bin spreein''roun' en cussin'  might'ly, he hear a sorter rustlin' fuss at de do', en in walk de  Bad Man.\"    \"Who, Uncle Remus?\" the little boy asked.    \"De Bad Man, honey; de Ole Boy hisse'f right fresh from de ridjun  w'at you year Miss Sally readin' 'bout. He done hide his hawns,  en his tail, en his hoof, en he come dress up like w'ite fokes.  He tuck off his hat en he bow, en den he tell de blacksmif who he  is, en dat he done come atter 'im. Den de black-smif, he gun ter  cry en beg, en he beg so hard en he cry so loud dat de Bad Man  say he make a trade wid 'im. At de een' er one year de sperit er  de blacksmif wuz to be his'n en endurin' er dat time de blacksmif  mus' put in his hottes' licks in de intruss er de Bad Man, en den  he put a spell on de cheer de blacksmif was settin' in, en on his  sludge-hammer. De man w'at sot in de cheer couldn't git up less'n  de blacksmif let 'im, en de man w'at pick up de sludge 'ud hatter  keep on knockin' wid it twel de blacksmif say quit; en den he gun  'im money plenty, en off he put.    \"De blacksmif, he sail in fer ter have his fun, en he have so  much dat he done clean forgot 'bout his contrack, but bimeby, one  day he look down de road, en dar he see de Bad Man comin', en den  he know'd de year wuz out. W'en de Bad Man got in de do', de  blacksmif wuz poundin' 'way at a hoss-shoe, but he wa'n't so  bizzy dat he didn't ax 'im in. De Bad Man sorter do like he ain't  got no time fer ter tarry, but de blacksmif say he got some  little jobs dat he bleedzd ter finish up, en den he ax de Bad Man  fer ter set down a minnit; en de Bad Man, he tuck'n sot down,  en  he sot in dat cheer w'at he done conju'd en, co'se, dar he wuz.  Den de blacksmif, he 'gun ter poke fun at de Bad Man, en he ax  him don't he want a dram, en won't he hitch his cheer up little  nigher de fier, en de Bad Man, he beg en he beg, but 'twan't  doin' no good, kase de blacksmif 'low dat he gwineter keep 'im  dar twel he prommus dat he let 'im off one year mo', en, sho  nuff, de Bad Man prommus dat ef de black-smif let 'im up he give  'im a n'er showin'.

Mont' in en mont' out  dat man wuz rollin' in dram, en bimeby yer come de Bad Man. De  blacksmif cry en he holler, en he rip 'roun' en t'ar his ha'r,  but hit des like he didn't, kase de Bad Man grab 'im up en cram  'im in a bag en tote 'im off. W'iles dey wuz gwine 'long dey come  up wid a passel er fokes w'at wuz havin' wanner deze yer fote er  July bobbycues, en de Ole Boy, he 'low dat maybe he kin git some  mo' game, en w'at do he do but jine in wid um.

Dat's w'at dey tells me. Hit may be wrong  er't maybe right, but dat's w'at I years.\"    *1 This story is popular on the coast and among the rice-     plantations, and, since the publication of some of the     animal-myths in the newspapers, I have received a version     of it from a planter in southwest Georgia; but it seems to     me to be an intruder among the genuine myth-stories of the     negroes. It is a trifle too elaborate. Nevertheless, it is     told upon the plantations with great gusto, and there are     several versions in circulation.      XXXIII.  WHY THE NEGRO IS BLACK    ONE night, while the little boy was watching Uncle Remus  twisting and waxing some shoe-thread, he made what appeared to  him to be a very curious discovery. He discovered that the palms  of the old man's hands were as white as his own, and the fact was  such a source of wonder that he at last made it the subject of  remark. The response of Uncle Remus led to the earnest recital of  a piece of unwritten history that must prove interesting to  ethnologists.    \"Tooby sho de pa'm er my han's w'ite, honey,\" he quietly  remarked, \"en, w'en it come ter dat, dey wuz a time w'en all de  w'ite folks 'uz black--blacker dan me, kaze I done bin yer so  long dat I bin sorter bleach out.\"    The little boy laughed. He thought Uncle Remus was making him  the victim of one of his jokes; but the youngster was never more  mistaken. The old man was serious. Nevertheless, he failed to  rebuke the ill-timed mirth of the child, appearing to be  altogether engrossed in his work. After a while, he resumed:    \"Yasser. Fokes dunner w'at bin yit, let 'lone w'at  gwinter be.  Niggers is niggers now, but de time wuz w'en we 'uz all niggers  tergedder.\"    \"When was that, Uncle Remus?\"    \"Way back yander. In dem times we 'uz all un us black; we 'uz all  niggers tergedder, en 'cordin' ter all de 'counts w'at I years  fokes 'uz gittin' 'long 'bout ez well in dem days ez dey is now.  But atter 'w'ile de news come dat dere wuz a pon' er water  some'rs in de naberhood, w'ich ef dey'd git inter dey'd be wash  off nice en w'ite, en den one un um, he fine de place en make er  splunge inter de pon', en come out w'ite ez a town gal. En den,  bless grashus! w'en de fokes seed it, dey make a break fer de  pon', en dem w'at wuz de soopless, dey got in fus' en dey come  out w'ite; en dem w'at wuz de nex' soopless, dey got in nex', en  dey come out merlatters; en dey wuz sech a crowd un um dat dey  mighty nigh use de water up, w'ich w'en dem yuthers come long, de  morest dey could do wuz ter paddle about wid der foots en dabble  in it wid der han's. Dem wuz de niggers, en down ter dis day dey  ain't no w'ite 'bout a nigger 'ceppin de pa'ms er der han's en de  soles er der foot.\"    The little boy seemed to be very much interested in this new  account of the origin of races, and he made some further  inquiries, which elicited from Uncle Remus the following  additional particulars:    \"De Injun en de Chinee got ter be 'counted 'long er de merlatter.  I ain't seed no Chinee dat I knows un, but dey tells me dey er  sorter 'twix' a brown en a brindle. Dey er all merlatters.\"    \"But mamma says the Chinese have straight hair,\" the little boy  suggested.    \"Co'se, honey,\" the old man unhesitatingly responded, \"dem  w'at git ter de pon' time nuff fer ter git der head in de water,  de water hit onkink der ha'r. Hit bleedzd ter be dat away.\"      XXXIV.  THE SAD FATE OF MR. FOX    \"Now, den,\" said Uncle Remus, with unusual gravity, as soon as  the little boy, by taking his seat, announced that he was ready  for the evening's entertainment to begin; \"now, den, dish yer  tale w'at I'm agwine ter gin you is de las' row er stumps, sho.  Dish yer's whar ole Brer Fox los' his breff, en he ain't fine it  no mo' down ter dis day.\"    \"Did he kill himself, Uncle Remus?\" the little boy asked, with a  curious air of concern.    \"Hol' on dar, honey!\" the old man exclaimed, with a great"]]]
