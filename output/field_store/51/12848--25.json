As soon as the ministerial troops had quitted the town, I ordered       a thousand men (who had had the small-pox), under command of       General Putnam, to take possession of the heights, which I shall       endeavour to fortify in such a manner as to prevent their return,       should they attempt it. But as they are still in the harbour, I       thought it not prudent to march off with the main body of the       army until I should be fully satisfied they had quitted the       coast. I have, therefore, only detached five regiments, besides       the rifle battalion, to New York, and shall keep the remainder       here till all suspicion of their return ceases.         The situation in which I found their works evidently discovered       that their retreat was made with the greatest precipitation. They       have left their barracks, and other works of wood at Bunker Hill,       &c., all standing, and have destroyed but a small part of their       lines. They have also left a number of fine pieces of cannon       which they first spiked up, also a very large iron mortar, and,       as I am informed, they have thrown another over the end of your       wharf. I have employed proper persons to drill the cannon, and       doubt not I shall save the most of them. I am not yet able to       procure an exact list of all the stores they have left. As soon       as it can be done, I shall take care to transmit it to you. From       an estimate of what the quartermaster-general has already       discovered, the amount will be twenty-five or thirty thousand       pounds.         Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the sixth instant has       already arrived. The remainder I have ordered to be stopped on       the road, as we shall have no occasion for it here. The letter to       General Thomas I immediately sent to him. He desired leave for       three or four days to settle some of his private affairs, after       which he will set out for his command in Canada. I am happy that       my conduct in intercepting Lord Drummond's letter is approved of       by Congress.                     I have the honour to be, &c.,                                                Geo. WASHINGTON.                                  _____    _The President of Congress to General Washington._                 (p. 005)         To         General WASHINGTON.              Philadelphia, April 2, 1776.         Sir: It gives me the most sensible pleasure to convey to you, by       order of Congress, the only tribute which a free people will ever       consent to pay--the tribute of thanks and gratitude to their       friends and benefactors. The disinterested and patriotic       principles which led you to the field have also led you to glory;       and it affords no little consolation to your countrymen to       reflect that, as a peculiar greatness of mind induced you to       decline any compensation for serving them, except the pleasure of       promoting their happiness, they may, without your permission,       bestow upon you the largest share of their affections and esteem.         Those pages in the annals of America will record your title to a       conspicuous place in the temple of fame which shall inform       posterity that, under your direction, an undisciplined band of       husbandmen, in the course of a few months, became soldiers; and       that the desolation meditated against the country by a brave army       of veterans, commanded by the most experienced generals, but       employed by bad men in the worst of causes, was, by the fortitude       of your troops, and the address of their officers, next to the       kind interposition of Providence, confined for near a year within       such narrow limits as scarcely to admit more room than was       necessary for the encampments and fortifications they lately       abandoned. Accept, therefore, Sir, the thanks of the United       Colonies, unanimously declared by their delegates to be due to       you and the brave officers and troops under your command; and be       pleased to communicate to them this distinguished mark of the       approbation of their country. The Congress have ordered a golden       medal, adapted to the occasion, to be struck, and, when finished,       to be presented to you.         I have the honour to be, with every sentiment of esteem, Sir,       your most obedient and very humble servant,                                               John HANCOCK, President.                                  _____    _John Adams to General Washington._         To         General WASHINGTON.              Philadelphia, April 2, 1776.         Sir: I congratulate you, as well as all the friends of mankind,       in the reduction of Boston, an event which appeared to me of so       great and decisive importance, that, the next morning after the       arrival of the news, I did myself the honour to move for the       thanks of Congress to Your Excellency, and that a medal of gold       should be struck in commemoration of it. Congress have been       pleased to appoint me, with two other gentlemen, to prepare a       device. I should be very happy to have Your Excellency's       sentiments concerning a proper one.         I have the honour to be, with great respect, Sir, your most       obedient and affectionate servant,                                         John ADAMS.                                  _____    _General Washington to John Adams._                                (p. 006)         To         John ADAMS, Esq.,                New York, April 15, 1776.            In Congress.         Sir: I am impressed with the deepest gratitude for the high       honour intended me by Congress. Whatever devices may be       determined upon by the respectable committee they have chosen for       that purpose will be highly agreeable to me.         I have the honour to be, most respectfully, Sir, your most       obedient and affectionate humble servant,                                                Geo. WASHINGTON.                                  _____    _Colonel Humphreys to General Washington._         To         General WASHINGTON.              Paris, May, 1785.         My dear General: Upon leaving America Mr. Morris invested me with       the power of procuring the several honourary presents which have       been voted by Congress to different officers in their service       during the late war. The Royal Academy of Inscriptions and       Belles-Lettres, to whom I addressed a letter on the subject, have       furnished me with the following device and inscriptions for the       gold medal which is to be executed for Your Excellency:         \"On one side, the head of the general. Legend: 'GEORGIO       WASHINGTON SUPREMO DUCI EXERCITUUM ADSERTORI LIBERTATIS COMITIA       AMERICANA.' On the reverse: Taking possession of Boston. The       American army advances in good order toward the town, which is       seen at a distance, while the British army flies with       precipitation toward the shore, to embark on board the vessels,       with which the harbour is covered. In the front of the American       army appears the general on horseback, in a group of officers,       whom he seems to make observe the flight of the enemy. Legend:       'HOSTIBUS PRIMO FUGATIS.' Exergue: 'BOSTONIUM RECUPERATUM DIE       XVII MARTII, MDCCLXXVI.'\"         I think it has the character of simplicity and dignity which is       to be aimed at in a memorial of this kind, which is designed to       transmit the remembrance of a great event to posterity. You       really do not know how much your name is venerated on this side       of the Atlantic.         I have the honour to be, my dear General, your sincere friend and       humble servant,                                          D. HUMPHREYS.                                  _____    _Colonel Humphreys to Thomas Jefferson._         To         Thomas JEFFERSON, Esq.,          London, January 30, 1786.            Paris.         Dear Sir: Gatteaux, the engraver, lives in the street St. Thomas       du Louvre, opposite the Treasury of the Duke de Chartres.         Now that there is no obstacle to commencing the medal for     (p. 007)       General Washington, since Houdon's return, I could wish,       should it not be giving you too much trouble, that you would send       for Duvivier, who lives in the old Louvre, and propose to him       undertaking it upon exactly the terms he had offered, which, I       think, were 2,400 livres, besides the gold and expense of       coinage. If he should not choose it, we must let it rest until       Dupre shall have finished General Greene's. Gatteaux has a paper       on which is the description of General Washington's medal.         I am, Sir, your most obedient and humble servant,                                                        D. HUMPHREYS.                                  _____    _Thomas Jefferson to Colonel Humphreys._         To         Colonel HUMPHREYS,               Paris, May 7, 1786.            London.         Dear Sir: I have received the books and papers you mention, and       will undertake to have finished what you left undone of the       medals, or, at least, will proceed in it till the matter shall be       put into better hands.         I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant,                                               Th: JEFFERSON.        No. 2.

As Jack took his  seat he noticed that the girls who had come in just ahead of the boys  were sitting close by.    \"They certainly do look like nice girls,\" was Jack's mental comment;  and he could not help but cast a second glance at the girl sitting  directly next to him. She was attired in a dark blue suit trimmed in  fur and held a hat to match in her lap. Jack noted that she was fair of  complexion, with dark, wavy hair.    \"I'm thinking this is going to be a pretty interesting picture for us,  Andy,\" remarked Randy, as the name of the production was flashed upon  the screen. \"'The Gold Hunter's Secret--A Drama of the Yukon,'\" he  read. \"That must have been taken in Alaska.\"    \"That's right, Randy,\" returned his twin. \"Gee! I hope this Alaskan  play doesn't affect us; like that other Alaskan play once affected  dad,\" he went on, referring to a most remarkable happening, the details  of which were given in \"The Rover Boys in Alaska.\"    \"It isn't likely to,\" answered Randy, promptly. \"Poor dad was in no  mental condition to attend that show, Uncle Dick once told me. He had  been knocked on the head with a footstool, and that had affected his  mind.\"    The four Rovers were soon absorbed in the stirring drama of the Alaskan  gold fields, and for the time being almost forgot their surroundings.  In the midst of the last reel, however, Jack felt the girl beside him  stirring.    \"It's my hatpin,\" she whispered. \"It just fell to the floor.\"    \"I'll get it,\" he returned promptly, and started to hunt in the dark.  He had to get up and push up his seat before the hatpin was recovered.    \"Oh, thank you very much,\" said the girl sweetly, when he presented the  article to her.    \"You are welcome, I'm sure,\" returned the Rover boy; and then he added  with a smile: \"Accidents will happen in the best of families, you  know,\" and at this both the girl and two of her companions giggled.    The photo-drama was presently finished and was followed by a  mirth-provoking comedy at which the entire audience laughed heartily.  Then came a reel of current events from various portions of the globe.    \"Say, there's something worth looking at!\" cried Fred, as a boat race  was flashed on the screen.    \"Right you are,\" responded Jack. \"Just see those fellows pull! Isn't it  grand?\" he added enthusiastically. \"I'd like to be in that shell  myself,\" and he turned suddenly, to catch the girl beside him casting  her eyes in his direction. She dropped them quickly, but her whole  manner showed that she, too, was interested, not only in the race, but  in what Jack had said. The cadets, of course, were in uniform, so the  girl knew they were from Colby Hall.    The reel of current events had almost come to a finish, and there was  intense silence as the picture showed the funeral of some well-known  man of the East, when there came a sudden splutter from the operator's  booth in the back gallery. This was followed by several flashes of  light and then a small explosion.    \"What's that?\"    \"Some explosion!\"    \"The theater's on fire!\"    \"Let's get out of this!\"    \"That's right! I don't want to be burnt to death!\"    Such were some of the exclamations which arose on the air. A panic had  seized the audience, and, like one person, they leaped to their feet  and began to fight to get out of the theater. In a twinkling there was  a crush in the aisles, and several people came close to being knocked  down and trampled upon.    \"Where's my hat?\"    \"Get back there--don't crush these children!\"    \"See the smoke pouring in!\"    \"Open the side door, somebody!\"    \"Keep cool! Keep cool!\" yelled somebody from the gallery. \"There is no  fire! Keep cool!\" But there was such a tumult below that scarcely  anybody paid attention to these words.    While many fought to get out the way they had come in, others stormed  towards the side doors of the playhouse. Meanwhile, an ill-smelling  cloud of smoke drifted through the auditorium.    With the first alarm the Rover boys had leaped to their feet, and  almost by instinct the others looked to Jack to see what he would do.    \"Oh, oh! is the place on fire?\" cried the girl who had been sitting  next to the oldest Rover, and she caught him by the arm.    \"I don't know,\" he answered. \"Something exploded in the operating  room.\"    \"Oh, let us get out!\" came from one of the other girls.    \"Yes, yes! I don't want to be burnt up!\" wailed a third.    \"Don't get excited,\" warned Jack. \"I don't believe there is any great  danger. There is no fire down here, and there seem to be plenty of  doors.\"    \"The fellow upstairs said to keep cool,\" put in Randy. \"Maybe it won't  amount to much after all.\"    Most of the lights had gone out, leaving the theater in almost total  darkness.    \"Come on for the side door,\" said Jack. \"That's the nearest way out.\"    The smoke from above was now settling, and this caused many to cough,  while it made seeing more difficult than ever. Jack pushed Fred ahead  of him, holding one hand on his cousin's shoulder, while with the other  hand he reached out and grasped the wrist of the girl who had been  sitting beside him.    \"You had better come this way,\" he said; \"and bring your friends  along.\"    \"All right. But do hurry!\" she pleaded. \"I am so afraid that something  will happen.\"    \"Oh, Ruth! can we get out?\" questioned the girl next to her.    \"I don't know. I hope so,\" answered the girl addressed, and then began  to cough slightly, for the smoke was steadily growing thicker.    It was no easy matter to reach the side entrance, for already half a  hundred people were striving to get through a doorway not much over two  feet wide. The air was filled with screams and exclamations of protest,  and for the time being in the theater it was as if bedlam had broken  loose.    \"Are we all here?\" came from Andy, as, with smarting eyes, he tried to  pierce the gloom.    \"I'm here,\" answered his twin.    \"So am I,\" came simultaneously from Jack and Fred.    Then Jack turned to the girl who was now beside him.    \"Are all your friends with you?\"    \"I--I think so,\" she faltered; and then she added: \"Annie, are Alice  and Jennie with you?\"    \"Yes. We're all here,\" came from somebody in the rear. \"But, oh, do let  us get out! I can scarcely breathe!\"    \"I've lost my hat!\" wailed another.    \"Oh, never mind your hat, Alice, as long as we get out,\" came from the  girl who was next to Jack.    At last the crowd at the doorway thinned out, and a moment later the  four Rovers, pushing the girls ahead of them, managed to get outside.  They found themselves in a narrow alleyway, and from this hurried to  the street beyond.    \"Oh, how glad I am that we are out of there!\" exclaimed the girl who  had been sitting beside Jack.    \"I'm glad myself,\" he added, wiping away the tears which the smoke had  started from his eyes.    \"If only they all get out safely!\" said one of the other girls.    \"I don't know about that,\" answered Randy, seriously. \"It was a bad  enough crush at that side door, but I think it was worse at the front  doors.\"    By this time everybody seemed to be out of the theater. An alarm of  fire had been sounded, and now a local chemical engine, followed by a  hook and ladder company, came rushing to the scene. There was, for  fully ten minutes, a good deal of excitement, but this presently died  down when it was learned positively that there was no fire outside the  metallic booth from which the pictures had been shown and where the  small explosion had occurred.    \"It wasn't much of an explosion,\" explained the manager of the theater.  \"It was more smoke than anything else.\"    \"Yes. And I yelled to the crowd that there was no fire and that they  must keep cool,\" added the man who had been operating the moving  picture machine.    In the excitement several people had been knocked down, but fortunately  nobody had been hurt. A number of articles of wearing apparel had been  left in the theater.    \"I wish I could get my hat,\" said the girl named Alice, wistfully. \"I  don't want to go back to school bareheaded.\"    \"What kind of a hat was it?\" questioned Randy, who stood beside her.  \"Maybe I can get it for you;\" and then, after the girl had given him a  description of the head covering, he went off to question one of the  theater men about it. In a few minutes more he came back with the  missing property.    After Randy returned, the boys introduced themselves to the girls, and  learned that all of the latter were scholars at Clearwater Hall. The  leader of the party was Ruth Stevenson, who had sat next to Jack, while  her friends were Annie Larkins, Alice Strobell, Jennie Mason and May  Powell.    \"I know a fellow named Powell quite well,\" remarked Jack, as the  last-named girl was introduced. \"He goes to our school. His name is  Dick, but we all call him Spouter.\"    \"Dick Powell is my cousin,\" answered May. And then she added smilingly:  \"I've heard of you Rover boys before.\"    \"Yes, and I've heard of you, too,\" broke in Ruth Stevenson.    \"And who told you about us?\" questioned Jack.    \"Why, a big boy at your school--the head of the football team.\"    \"Oh! do you know Gif Garrison?\"    \"Yes. I suppose you know him quite well?\"    \"Well, I should say so!\" declared Jack. \"Why, my cousin Fred here is  named after Gif Garrison's father. His father and my father were school  chums.\"    \"Oh! Why then we know a lot of the same people, don't we? How nice!\"  returned Ruth Stevenson, and smiled frankly at Jack.    After that the talk between the boys and the girls became general, and  each crowd told the other of how matters were going at their own  particular school.    \"Yes, I've been up to Colby Hall several times to see the baseball and  the football games,\" said Ruth to Jack in answer to his question. \"It's  certainly a splendid place.\"    \"Some day, if you don't mind, I'll come over and take a look at  Clearwater Hall,\" "]]]
