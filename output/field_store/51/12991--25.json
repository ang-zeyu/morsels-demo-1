The cost of a book of twenty-four leaves three and a half inches  square of English gold leaf of good ordinary quality is from 1s. 3d.  to 1s. 6d., whereas the cost of a book of double thick pure gold leaf  is 3s. to 3s. 6d. For tooled work it is worth paying the increased  price for the sake of the advantages in colour and solidity; but for  lines and edges, which use up an immense amount of gold, the thinner  and cheaper gold may quite well be used.    Besides pure gold leaf, gold alloyed with various metals to change its  colour can be had. None of the alloys keep their colour as well as  pure gold, and some of them, such as those alloyed with copper for red  gold, and with silver for pale gold, tarnish very quickly. These last  are not to be recommended.    For silver tooling aluminium leaf may be used, as silver leaf  tarnishes very quickly.    When the gold is pressed into the impressions of the tools with the  pad of cotton-wool, they should be plainly visible through it.    The pattern must now be worked through the gold with the hot tools.  The tools are taken from the stove, and if too hot cooled on a pad as  for blinding-in. The heat required to leave the gold tooling solid and  bright and the impressions clear will vary for different leathers, and  even for different skins of the same leather. For trial a tool may be  laid on the pad until it ceases to hiss, and one or two impressions  worked with it. If the gold fails to stick, the heat may be slightly  increased.    If the leather is slightly damp from the preparation the tools will  usually work better, and less heat is required than if it has been  prepared for some time and has got dry.    Before using, the faces of all tools must be rubbed bright on the  flesh side of a piece of leather. It is impossible to tool brightly  with dirty tools. A tool should be held in the right hand, with the  thumb on the top of the handle, and steadied with the thumb or first  finger of the left hand. The shoulder should be brought well over the  tool, and the upper part of the body used as a press. If the weight of  the body is used in finishing, the tools can be worked with far  greater firmness and certainty, and with less fatigue, than if the  whole work is done with the muscles of the arms.    Large and solid tools will require all the weight that can be put on  them, and even then the gold will often fail to stick with one  impression. Tools with small surfaces, such as gouges and dots, must  not be worked too heavily, or the surface of the leather may be cut.    To strike a large or solid tool, it should first be put down flat, and  then slightly rocked from side to side and from top to bottom, but  must not be twisted on the gold.    A tool may be struck from whichever side the best \"sight\" can be got,  and press and book turned round to the most convenient position.    It is difficult to impress some tools, such as circular flower tools,  twice in exactly the same place. Such tools should have a mark on one  side as a guide. This should always be kept in the same position when  blinding-in and tooling, and so make it possible to impress a second  time without \"doubling.\" An impression is said to be \"doubled\" when  the tool has been twisted in striking, or one impression does not fall  exactly over the other.    The hot tool should not be held hovering over the impression long, or  the preparation will be dried up before the tool is struck. Tooling  will generally be brighter if the tools are struck fairly sharply, and  at once removed from the leather, than if they are kept down a long  time.    To \"strike\" dots, the book should be turned with the head to the  worker, and the tool held with the handle inclining slightly towards  him. This will make them appear bright when the book is held the right  way up.    Gouges must be \"sighted\" from the inside of the curve, and struck  evenly, or the points may cut into the leather. Short straight lines  may be put in with pieces of line, and longer ones with a fillet.    A one line fillet is shown at fig. 88; the space filed out of the  circumference is to enable lines to be joined neatly at the corners.  That the lines may be clearly visible through the gold, the book  should be placed so that the light comes from the left hand of the  worker and across the line. It is well to have a basin of water in  which to cool fillets, as there is so much metal in them, that the  damp sponge or cotton used for cooling tools would very rapidly be  dried up. When the fillet has been cooled, the edge should be rubbed  on the cleaning pad, and the point exactly adjusted to the corner of  the line to be run (see fig. 88). The fillet is then run along the  line with even pressure.        [Illustration: FIG. 88.]    For slightly curved lines, a very small fillet may be used.    When all the prepared part of a pattern has been tooled, it is well  rubbed to remove the loose gold with a slightly greasy rag, or with a  piece of bottle indiarubber which has been softened in paraffin. After  a time the rubber or rag may be sold to the gold-beater, who recovers  the gold. To prepare indiarubber for cleaning off gold, a piece of  bottle rubber is cut into small pieces and soaked in paraffin for some  hours. This should cause the pieces to reunite into a soft lump. This  can be used until it is yellow with gold throughout.    When all free gold is rubbed off, the finisher can see where the  tooling is imperfect. Impressions which are not \"solid\" must be  reglaired, have fresh gold laid on, and be retooled. But if, as will  sometimes happen with the best finishers, the gold has failed to stick  properly anywhere, it is best to wash the whole with water or vinegar,  and prepare afresh.    As an excess of grease is apt to dull the gold and soil the leather,  it is better to use it very sparingly when laying on fresh gold for  mending. For patching, benzine may be used instead of grease. When the  gold is picked up on the cotton-wool pad, rapidly go over the leather  with wool soaked in benzine, and at once lay down the gold. Benzine  will not hold the gold long enough for much tooling, but it will  answer for about half-an-hour, and give plenty of time for patching.    Imperfect tooling arises from a variety of causes. If an impression is  clear, but the gold not solid, it is probably because the tool was not  hot enough, or was not put down firmly. If only one side of an  impression fails to stick, it is usually because the tool was unevenly  impressed. If an impression is blurred, and the gold has a frosted  look, it is because the leather has been burned, either because the  tool was too hot, or kept down too long, or the preparation was too  fresh.    To mend double or burnt impressions the leather should be wetted and  left to soak a short time, and the gold can be picked out with a  wooden point. When nearly dry the impressions should be put in again  with a cool tool, reglaired and retooled.    It is very difficult to mend neatly if the leather is badly burnt.  Sometimes it may be advisable to paste a piece of new leather over a  burnt impression before retooling.    If a tool is put down in the wrong place by mistake, it is difficult  to get the impression out entirely. The best thing to do is to damp  the leather thoroughly, leave it to soak for a little while, and pick  up the impression with the point of a pin. It is best not to use an  iron point for this, as iron is apt to blacken the leather.    Leather is difficult to tool if it has not a firm surface, or if it is  too thin to give a little when the tool is struck.    When the tooling is finished, and the loose gold removed with the  rubber, the leather should be washed with benzine, to remove any  grease and any fragments of gold that may be adhering by the grease  only.    The inside margins of the boards are next polished and varnished, and  the end papers pasted down. Or if there is a leather joint, the panel  left on the board may be filled in (see Chapter XVII).    When the end papers are dry, the sides and back may be polished and  varnished.    It is important that the varnish should be of good quality, and not  too thick, or it will in time turn brown and cause the gold to look  dirty. Some of the light French spirit varnishes prepared for  bookbinders answer well. Varnish must be used sparingly, and is best  applied with a pad of cotton-wool. A little varnish is poured on to  the pad, which is rubbed on a piece of paper until it is seen that the  varnish comes out thinly and evenly. It is then rubbed on the book  with a spiral motion. The quicker the surface is gone over, provided  every part is covered, the better. Varnish will not work well if it is  very cold, and in cold weather both the book and varnish bottle should  be slightly warmed before use. Should an excess of varnish be put on  in error, or should it be necessary to retool part of the book after  it has been varnished, the varnish can be removed with spirits of  wine. Varnish acts as a preservative to the leather, but has the  disadvantage, if used in excess, of making it rather brittle on the  surface. It must, therefore, be used very sparingly at the joints. It  is to be hoped that a perfectly elastic varnish, that will not tarnish  the gold, will soon be discovered.    As soon as the varnish is dry the boards may be pressed, one at a  time, to give the leather a smooth surface (see fig. 83), leaving each  board in the press for some hours.        [Illustration: FIG. 89.]    After each board has been pressed separately the book should be shut,  and pressed again with pressing plates on each side of it, and with  tins covered with paper placed inside each board.

He was high Marshal of _England_,    When _Henry_ the Third did Reign;  But this you take upon my Word,    That he'll ne'er be so again.    Here the Lord _Edward Talbot_ lies,    The Town of _Shrewsbury's_ Earl;  Together with his Countess fair,    That was a most delicate Girl.    The next to him there lyeth one,    Sir _Richard Peckshall_ hight;  Of whom we only this do say,    He was a _Hampshire_ Knight.    But now to tell you more of him,    There lies beneath this Stone:  Two Wives of his, and Daughters four,    To all of Us unknown.    Sir _Bernard Brockhurst_ there doth lie,    Lord Chamberlain to Queen _Ann_;  Queen _Ann_ was _Richard_ the Second's Queen,    And was King of _England_.    Sir _Francis Hollis_, the Lady _Frances_,    The same was _Suffolk's_ Dutchess;  Two Children of _Edward_ the Third,    Lie here in Death's cold Clutches.    This is the Third King _Edward's_ Brother,    Of whom our Records tell  Nothing of Note, nor say they whether,    He be in Heaven or Hell.    This same was _John_ of _Eldeston_,    He was no Costermonger;  But _Cornwall's_ Earl, and here's one dy'd,    'Cause he could live no longer.    The Lady _Mohun_, Dutchess of _York_,    And Duke of _York's_ Wife also;  But Death resolv'd to Horn the Duke,    She lies now with Death below.    The Lady _Ann Ross_, but wot ye well,    That she in Childbed dy'd;  The Lady Marquiss of _Winchester_,    Lies Buried by her side.    Now think your Penny well spent good Folks,    And that you're not beguil'd;  Within this Cup doth lie the Heart    Of a _French Embassador's_ Child.    But how the Devil it came to pass,    On purpose, or by chance;  The Bowels they lie underneath,    The Body is in _France_.    [Sidenote: Dol. _I warrant ye the_ Pharises _carried it away._]    There's _Oxford's_ Countess, and there also    The Lady _Burleigh_ her Mother;  And there her Daughter, a Countess too,    Lie close by one another.    These once were bonny Dames, and tho'    There were no Coaches then,  Yet could they jog their Tails themselves,    Or had them jogg'd by Men.    [Sidenote: Dick. _Ho, ho, ho, I warrant ye they did as other Women  did, ha_ Ralf. Ralf. _Oy, Oy._]    But woe is me! those high born Sinners;    That went to pray so stoutly;  Are now laid low, and 'cause they can't,    Their Statues pray devoutly.    This is the Dutchess of _Somerset_,    By Name the Lady _Ann_;  Her Lord _Edward_ the Sixth Protected,    Oh! he was a Gallant Man.    [Sidenote: Tom. _I have heard a Ballad of him sang at_ Ratcliff Cross.  Mol. _I believe we have it at home over our Kitchin Mantle-Tree._]    In this fair Monument which you see,    Adorn'd with so many Pillars;  Doth lie the Countess of _Buckingham_,    And her Husband, Sir _George Villers_.    This old Sir _George_ was Grandfather,    And the Countess she was Granny;  To the great Duke of _Buckingham_,    Who often topt King _Jammy_.    Sir _Robert Eatam_, a _Scotch_ Knight,    This Man was Secretary;  And scribl'd Compliments for two Queens,    Queen _Ann_, and eke Queen _Mary_.    This was the Countess of _Lenox_,    Yclep'd the Lady _Marget_:  King _James's_ Grandmother, and yet    'Gainst Death she had no Target.    This was Queen _Mary_, Queen of _Scots_,    Whom _Buchanan_ doth bespatter;  She lost her Head at _Tottingham_,    What ever was the Matter.    [Sidenote: Dol. _How came she here then?_ Will. _Why ye silly Oafe  could not she be brought here, after she was Dead?_]    The Mother of our Seventh _Henry_,    This is that lyeth hard by;  She was the Countess wot ye well,    Of _Richmond_ and of _Derby_.    _Henry_ the Seventh lieth here,    With his fair Queen beside him,  He was the Founder of this Chapel,    Oh! may no ill betide him.    Therefore his Monument's in Brass,    You'll say that very much is;  The Duke of _Richmond_ and _Lenox_,    There lieth with his Dutchess.    [Sidenote: Rog. _I warrant ye these were no small Fools in those  days._]    And here they stand upright in a Press    With Bodies made of Wax;  With a Globe and a Wand in either Hand,    And their Robes upon their Backs.    Here lies the Duke of _Buckingham_,    And the Dutchess his Wife;  Him _Felton_ Stabb'd at _Portsmouth_ Town,    And so he lost his Life.    Two Children of King _James_ these are,    Whom Death keeps very chary;  _Sophia_ in the Cradle lies,    And this is the Lady _Mary_.    [Sidenote: Bess. _Good Woman pray still your Child, it keeps such a  bawling, we can't hear what the Man says._]    And this is Queen _Elizabeth_,    How the _Spaniards_ did infest her?  Here she lies Buried, with Queen _Mary_,    And now agrees with her Sister.    To another Chapel now we come,    The People follow and chat;  This is the Lady _Cottington_,    And the People cry, who's that?    This is the Lady _Frances Sidney_,    The Countess of _Suffolk_ was she;  And this the Lord _Dudley Carleton_ is,    And then they look up and see.    Sir _Thomas Brumley_ lieth here,    Death would him not reprieve;  With his four Sons, and Daughters four,    That once were all alive.    The next is Sir _John Fullerton_,    And this is his Lady I trow;  And this is Sir _John Puckering_,    Whom none of you did know.    That's the Earl of _Bridgwater_ in the middle,    Who makes no use of his Bladder;  Although his Lady lie so near him,    And so we go up a Ladder.    [Sidenote: Kate. _He took more pains, than I would ha done for a  Hundred such._]    _Edward_ the First, that Gallant Blade,    Lies underneath this Stone;  And this is the Chair which he did bring,    A good while ago from _Scone_.    In this same Chair, till now of late,    Our Kings and Queens were Crown'd;  Under this Chair another Stone    Doth lie upon the Ground.    [Sidenote: Ralf. _Gad I warrant there has been many a Maiden-head got  in that Chair._ Tom. _Gad and I'll come hither and try one of these  Days, an't be but to get a Prince._ Dol. _A_ Papist _I warrant him._]    On that same Stone did _Jacob_ sleep,    Instead of a Down Pillow;  And after that 'twas hither brought,    By some good honest Fellow.    _Richard_ the Second lieth here,    And his first Queen, Queen _Ann_;  _Edward_ the Third lies here hard by,    Oh! there was a Gallant Man.    For this was his two handed Sword,    A Blade both true and Trusty;  The _French_ Men's Blood was ne'er wip'd off,    Which makes it look so rusty.    Here he lies again, with his Queen _Philip_,    A _Dutch_ Woman by Record,  But that's all one, for now alass!    His Blade's not so long as his Sword.    King _Edward_ the Confessor lies    Within this Monument fine;  I'm sure, quoth one, a worser Tomb    Must serve both me and mine.    _Harry_ the Fifth lies there, and there    Doth lie Queen _Eleanor_;  To our first _Edward_ she was Wife,    Which was more than ye knew before.    _Henry_ the Third lies there Entomb'd,    He was Herb _John_ in Pottage;  Little he did, but still Reign'd on,    Although his Sons were at Age.    Fifty six Years he Reigned King,    E'er he the Crown would lay by;  Only we praise him, 'cause he was    Last Builder of the _Abby_.    Here _Thomas Cecil_ lies, who's that?    Why 'tis the Earl of _Exeter_;  And this his Countess is, to Die  How it perplexed her.    [Sidenote: Dol. _Ay, ay, I warrant her, rich Folks are as unwilling to  die as poor Folks._]    Here _Henry Cary_, Lord _Hunsdon_ rests,    What a noise he makes with his Name?  Lord Chamberlain was he unto    Queen _Elizabeth_ of great Fame.    [Sidenote: Sisly. _That's he for whom our Bells ring so often, is it  not_ Mary? Mol. _Ay, ay, the very same._]    And here's one _William Colchester_    Lies of a Certainty;  An Abbot was he of _Westminster_,    And he that saith no, doth lie.    This is the Bishop of _Durham_,    By Death here lay'd in Fetters;  _Henry_ the Seventh lov'd him well,    And so he wrote his Letters.    Sir _Thomas Bacchus_, what of him?    Poor Gentleman not a Word;  Only they Buried him here; but now    Behold that Man with a Sword.    _Humphry de Bohun_, who though he were    Not born with me i'the same Town;  Yet I can tell he was Earl of _Essex_,    Of _Hertford_, and _Northampton_.    He was High Constable of _England_,    As History well expresses;  But now pretty Maids be of good Chear,    We're going up to the Presses.    And now the Presses open stand,    And ye see them all arow;  But never no more are said of these    Then what is said below.    Now down the Stairs come we again,    The Man goes first with a Staff;  Some two or three tumble down the Stairs,    And then the People laugh.    This is the great Sir _Francis Vere_,    That so the _Spaniards_ curry'd;  Four Colonels support his Tomb,    And here his Body's Buried.    That _Statue_ against the _Wall_ with one Eye,    Is Major General _Norris_;  He beat the _Spaniards_ cruelly,    As is affirm'd in Stories.    [Sidenote: Dick. _I warrant ye he had two, if he could have but kep'd  'em._]    His six Sons there hard by him stand,    Each one was a Commander;  To shew he could a Lady serve,    As well as the _Hollander_.    And there doth Sir _John Hollis_ rest,    Who was the Major General;  To Sir _John Norris_, that brave blade,    And so they go to Dinner all.    For now the Shew is at an end,    All things are done and said;  The Citizen pays for his Wife,    The Prentice for the Maid.          _A_ SONG _Sung by Mrs._ CAMPION, _in the Comedy call'd_, she wou'd and  she wou'd not. _By Mr._ JOHN WELDON.
