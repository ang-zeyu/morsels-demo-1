Perhaps we may find and use it.\"    \"They came from the sea--by a ship, then?\" Ross asked. She shook her  head.    \"No, there was no ship; they came walking through the breaking waves as  if they had followed some road across the sea bottom.\"    \"A sub!\"    \"What is that?\" Torgul demanded.    \"A type of ship which goes under the waves, not through them, carrying  air within its hull for the breathing of the crew.\"    Torgul's eyes narrowed. One of the other captains who had been summoned  from the two companion cruisers gave a snort of disbelief.    \"There are no such ships--\" he began, to be silenced by a gesture from  Torgul.    \"We know of no such ships,\" the other corrected. \"But then we know of no  such devices as Jazia saw in operation either. How does one war upon  these under-the-seas ships, Ross?\"    The Terran hesitated. To describe to men who knew nothing of explosives  the classic way of dealing with a sub via depth charges was close to  impossible. But he did his best.    \"Among my people one imprisons in a container a great power. Then the  container is dropped near the sub and--\"    \"And how,\" broke in the skeptical captain, \"do you know where such a  ship lies? Can you see it through the water?\"    \"In a way--not see, but hear. There is a machine which makes for the  captain of the above-seas ship a picture of where the sub lies or moves  so that he may follow its course. Then when he is near enough he drops  the container and the power breaks free--to also break apart the sub.\"    \"Yet the making of such containers and the imprisoning of the power  within them,\" Torgul said, \"this is the result of a knowledge which is  greater than any save the Foanna may possess. You do not have it?\" His  conclusion was half statement, half question.    \"No. It took many years and the combined knowledge of many men among my  people to make such containers, such a listening device. I do not have  it.\"    \"Why then think of what we do not have?\" Torgul's return was decisive.  \"What _do_ we have?\"    Ross's head came up. He was listening, not to anything in that cabin,  but to a sound which had come through the port just behind his head.  There--it had come again! He was on his feet.    \"What--?\" Vistur's hand hovered over the ax at his belt. Ross saw their  gaze centered on him.    \"We may have reinforcements now!\" The Terran was already on his way to  the deck.    He hurried to the rail and whistled, the thin, shrill summons he had  practiced for weeks before he had ever begun this fantastic adventure.    A sleek dark body broke water and the dolphin grin was exposed as  Tino-rau answered his call. Though Ross's communication powers with the  two finned scouts was very far from Karara's, he caught the message in  part and swung around to face the Rovers who had crowded after him.    \"We have a way now of learning more about your enemies.\"    \"A boat--it comes without sail or oars!\" One of the crew pointed.    Ross waved vigorously, but no hand replied from the skiff. Though it  came steadily onward, the three cruisers its apparent goal.    \"Karara!\" Ross called.    Then side by side with Tino-rau were two wet heads, two masked faces  showing as the swimmers trod water--Karara and Loketh.    \"Drop ropes!\" Ross gave that order as if he rather than Torgul  commanded. And the Captain himself was one of those who moved to obey.    Loketh came out of the sea first and as he scrambled over the rail he  had his sword ready, looking from Ross to Torgul. The Terran held up  empty hands and smiled.    \"No trouble now.\"    Loketh snapped up his mask. \"So the Sea Maid said the finned ones  reported. Yet before, these thirsted for your blood on their blades.  What magic have you worked?\"    \"None. Just the truth has been discovered.\" Ross reached for Karara's  hand as she came nimbly up the rope, swung her across the rail to the  deck where she stood unmasked, brushing back her hair and looking around  with a lively curiosity.    \"Karara, this is Captain Torgul,\" Ross introduced the Rover commander  who was staring round-eyed at the girl. \"Karara is she who swims with  the finned ones, and they obey her.\" Ross gestured to Tino-rau. \"It is  Taua who brings the skiff?\" he asked the Polynesian.    She nodded. \"We followed from the gate. Then Loketh came and said that  ... that....\" She paused and then added, \"But you do not seem to be in  danger. What has happened?\"    \"Much. Listen--this is important. There is trouble at an island ahead.  The Baldies were there; they murdered the kin of these men. The odds are  they reached there by some form of sub. Send one of the dolphins to see  what is happening and if they are still there....\"    Karara asked no more questions, but whistled to the dolphin. With a flip  of tail Tino-rau took off.    Since they could make no concrete plan of action, the cruiser captains  agreed to wait for Tino-rau's report and to cruise well out of sight of  the fairing harbor until it came.    \"This belief in magic,\" Ross remarked to Karara, \"has one advantage. The  natives seem able to take in their stride the fact the dolphins will  scout for us.\"    \"They have lived their lives on the sea; for it they must have a vast  respect. Perhaps they know, as did my people, that the ocean has many  secrets, some of which are never revealed except to the forms of life  which claim their homes there. But, even if you discover this Baldy sub,  what will the Rovers be able to do about it?\"    \"I don't know--yet.\" Ross could not tell why he clung to the idea that  they could do anything to strike back at the superior alien force. He  only knew that he was not yet willing to relinquish the thought that in  some way they could.    \"And Ashe?\"    Yes, Ashe....    \"I don't know.\" It hurt Ross to admit that.    \"Back there, what really happened at the gate?\" he asked Karara. \"All at  once the dolphins seemed to go crazy.\"    \"I think for a moment or two they did. You felt nothing?\"    \"No.\"    \"It was like a fire slashing through the head. Some protective device of  the Foanna, I think.\"    A mental defense to which he was not sensitive. Which meant that he  might be able to breach that gate if none of the others could. But he  had to be there first. Suppose, just suppose Torgul could be persuaded  that this attack on the gutted Kyn Add was useless. Would the Rover  commander take them back to the Foanna keep? Or with the dolphins and  the skiff could Ross himself return to make the try?    That he could make it on his own, Ross doubted. Excitement and will  power had buoyed him up throughout the past Hawaikan day and night. Now  fatigue closed in, past his conditioning and the built-in stimulant of  the Terran rations, to enclose him in a groggy haze. He had been warned  against this reaction, but that was just another item he had pushed out  of his conscious mind. The last thing he remembered now was seeing  Karara move through a fuzzy cloud.    Voices argued somewhere beyond, the force of that argument carried more  by tone than any words Ross could understand. He was pulled sluggishly  out of a slumber too deep for any dream to trouble, and lifted heavy  eyelids to see Karara once again. There was a prick in his arm--or was  that part of the unreality about him?    \"--four--five--six--\" she was counting, and Ross found himself joining  in:    \"--seven--eight--nine--ten!\"    On reaching \"ten\" he was fully awake and knew that she had applied the  emergency procedure they had been drilled in using, giving him a pep  shot. When Ross sat up on the narrow bunk there was a light in the cabin  and no sign of day outside the porthole. Torgul, Vistur, the two other  cruiser captains, all there ... and Jazia.    Ross swung his feet to the deck. A pep-shot headache was already  beginning, but would wear off soon. There was, however, a concentration  of tension in the cabin, and something must have driven Karara to use  the drug.    \"What is it?\"    Karara fitted the medical kit into the compact carrying case.    \"Tino-rau has returned. There _is_ a sub in the bay. It emits energy  waves on a shoreward beam.\"    \"Then they are still there.\" Ross accepted the dolphin's report without  question. Neither of the scouts would make a mistake in those matters.  Energy waves beamed shoreward--power for some type of unit the Baldies  were using? Suppose the Rovers could find a way of cutting off the  power.    \"The Sea Maid has told us that this ship sits on the bottom of the  harbor. If we could board it--\" began Torgul.    \"Yes!\" Vistur brought his fist down against the end of the bunk on which  the Terran still sat, jarring the dull, drug-borne pain in Ross's head.  \"Take it--then turn it against its crew!\"    There was an eagerness in all Rover faces. For that was a game the  Hawaikan seafarers understood: Take an enemy ship and turn its armament  against its companions in a fleet. But that plan would not work out.  Ross had a healthy respect for the technical knowledge of the galactic  invaders. Of course he, Karara, even Loketh might be able to reach the  sub. Whether they could then board her was an entirely different matter.    Now the Polynesian girl shook her head. \"The broadcast there--Tino-rau  rates it as lethal. There are dead fish floating in the bay. He had  warning at the reef entrance. Without a shield, there will be no way of  getting in.\"    \"Might as well wish for a depth bomb,\" Ross began and then stopped.    \"You have thought of something?\"    \"A shield--\" Ross repeated her words. It was so wild this thought of  his, and one which might have no chance of working. He knew almost  nothing about the resources of the invaders. Could that broadcast which  protected the sub and perhaps activated the weapons of the invaders  ashore be destroyed? A wall of fish--sea life herded in there as a  shield ... wild, yes, even so wild it might work. Ross"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19676"],[0,"Shakespeare and Music (#19)"],[1,"are the 'Cinq' pas, and 5 is the characteristic leap or  caper.    The next six minims are danced to the Revers, which is just the same,  except that the words 'right' and 'left' (_droicte_ and _gaulche_)  change places all the way down. Then repeat till the tune is finished.    Arbeau gives several other varieties of Galliard, and another very  good tune for it, called    'ANTHOINETTE.' GALLIARD.    [Music]    The 'sault majeur' in this tune would come in the middle of the  semibreves in the first strain; at the 'dot' of the dotted minims in  the 2nd and 3rd strains; or, again, in the middle of the semibreves in  the same strains.    Of the Pavan [commonly danced before the Basse-dance], Arbeau says it  is very easy, consisting only of 'two simples and a double' advancing,  and again 'two simples and a double' retiring. It is (as we already  know) in Binary measure, and the careful Capriol once more joins in  with his calculations of time, saying that he makes the Pavan 8  measures [semibreves] 'en marchant,' and 8 measures 'desmarchant.'    The master now gives particular instructions about the form and manner  of dancing the Pavan. Noblemen dance these pavans and basse-dances  'belles et graves,' with cap and sword; others in long robes,  'marchants honnestement, avec une gravite posee.' And the damoiselles  with an humble countenance, 'les yeulx baissez, regardans quelquefois  les assistans avec une pudeur virginale.' Kings, princes, and  'Seigneurs graves,' in dancing the pavan on great occasions, wear  their 'grands manteaux, et robes de parade.' Also, Queens, Princesses,  and Ladies accompanying them, have their robes 'abaissees et  trainans,' 'quelquefois portees par demoiselles.' The Pavan on these  occasions is called LE GRAND BAL, and the music is provided, not by  simple flute and drum, but by 'haulbois et saquebouttes,' and they  continue the tune until the dancers have made the circuit of the  'salle' twice or thrice.    Besides this state dancing of pavans, this dance was used in  Mascarade, when triumphal chariots of gods and goddesses enter, or of  emperors and kings 'plains de maieste.'    On p. 29 ff, Arbeau gives the vocal Pavan for four voices, 'Belle qui  tiens ma vie,' which is quoted in Grove. The proper drum  accompaniment, continued throughout the 32 bars (2/2) is--[Music] etc.  He also gives seven more verses of words to it, and says if you do not  wish to dance, you can play or sing it. Moreover, he adds, that the  drum is not a necessity, but is good to keep the time equal; and that  for dancing you may use violins, spinets, flutes, both traverse and 'a  neuf trous' (nine-holed flute--_i.e._, a flageolet), hautboys, and, in  fact, 'all sorts of instruments'; or you may sing instead.    Arbeau's account of the Passemeze, or Passy-measures-pavin of  Shakespeare, is very simple. He says that the instrumentalists  increase the speed of the _pavan_ every time they play it through, and  by the time it has reached the moderate speed of a _basse-dance_, it  is no longer called Pavan, but Passemeze.    Besides the State Pavan, and the Passamezzo Pavan, there is the  'Pavane d'Espagne,' which has some similarity to the Canaries.    Arbeau says that some consider the name Canaries to be that of a dance  in use in those islands. But he thinks it more likely to have  originated in a Ballet in a Mascarade, where the dancers were clad as  kings and queens 'de Mauritanie,' as savages, with various coloured  feathers. He says it is danced by a gentleman and a lady, from  opposite ends of the room, each advancing and then retiring in turn.    The steps and tune are as follows--    CANARIES.    [Music]         1. Tappement du pied gauche, causant pied en l'air droit.         2. Marque talon droit (right heel).         3. Marque pied droit.         4. Tappement du pied droit, causant pied en l'air gauche.         5. Marque talon gauche (left heel).         6. Marque pied gauche.         7-12 are the same again.    Then for the 2nd half, instead of the 'tappements' at the minims, you  should make 'une greve fort haulte, rabaissee en tappement de pied  traine en derrier, comme si on marchoit dessus un crachat, ou qu'on  voulust tuer une araignee.' (Make a very high step, but instead of  tapping the foot, scrape it backwards, as if you were treading on  spittle, or wanted to kill a spider.)    Arbeau gives 17 different kinds of Branle (Brawl of Shakespeare)  before coming to the Branle des Sabots, which is danced, 2 beats in a  bar, four steps to the right, then four to the left, like the branle  doubles; then two simples (see above), and three taps of the foot, and  Repeat.    BRANLE DES SABOTS, p. 88.    [Music]                      { 1. Pied gaulche largy (left foot forward).       _Double_     { 2.   \"  droit approche (right foot up to the left).       _gaulche._   { 3. Pied gaulche largy.                    { 4. Pieds joincts (join feet).                      { 5-8 are the same, 'right' and 'left' changing                    { places, forming a 'double _droit_.'         _Simple_     { {  9. P.g. largy.       _gauche._    { { 10. Pieds joincts.                    {       _Simple_     { { 11. P.d. largy.       _droit._     { { 12.

There is only one step to each Semibreve, so the tune must have been  played fast.    On p. 64 Arbeau treats of the Lavolta ('high lavolt' of Shakespeare),  which he says is a kind of galliard well known in Provence. One  feature was that you had to keep turning round.    _Capriol_ does not agree with these whirlings, for he immediately  says--'Ces vertigues et tornoiements de cerveau me fascheroient.'    AIR D'UNE VOLTE. [LA VOLTA.]    [Music]         1. Petit pas, en saultant sur le gaulche, pour faire pied en       l'air droit.         2. Plus grand pas du droit.         3. Sault majeur.         4. Posture en pieds joincts; etc., all over again every two       bars.    The sault majeur of the 'high lavolt' comes at the _semibreves_ in  this tune.    On p. 67 he gives the Courante--    COURANTE.    [Music]    The movements are--    1, 2, simple gauche; 3, 4, simple droit; and 5-8, a 'double a gauche.'  These terms have already been explained.    One of the many Bransles is the 'Branle de la Haye,' the Hay of  Shakespeare. Arbeau says--first the dancers dance alone, each  separately; then together _so as to interlace_, 'et font _la haye_ les  uns parmy les aultres.' That is, during each batch of 4 steps, the  dancers _change places_ one with another, so that if there are three  dancers, A, B, C, in the first 4 steps, B and A change places, and  make B, A, C; in the next 4 steps, C and A change places, and make B,  C, A, etc.    Here is the tune and the formula of steps--    THE HAYE.    [Music]    Beginning at the 1st complete bar, and reckoning one step to each  semibreve--1. Deux simples (ss). 2. Double (d). 3. ss. 4. d. 5. ss.  6. d. 7. ss. 8. d.    The Morisque, which may at all events be compared with the little we  know of the Shakespearian Morris dance, seems to have been very  violent exercise for the heels (talon). Arbeau mentions that it is bad  for the gout. The reader will notice that there is a separate movement  for each crotchet in the following tune.    MORISQUE.    [Music]         1. Frappe talon droit (strike right heel).       2.    \"         gaulche (left).       3.    \"            \"      d.       4.    \"            \"      g.       5. Frappe talons (perhaps 'strike heels together').       6. Soupir (slight pause).    Repeat, then the second half--1-4, 5-8, 9-12, are same as 1-4, ending  with 5, 6, as in the 1st half.    No wonder it was bad for the gout!          VI    MISCELLANEOUS, INCLUDING PYTHAGOREANISM AND SHAKESPEARE'S ACCOUNT OF  THE MORE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF MUSIC      A well-known passage in _Twelfth Night_ gives us the Opinion of  Pythagoras 'concerning wild-fowl.'    The Opinion of Pythagoras 'concerning Music' is at least equally  interesting, and is appropriated and assimilated by Shakespeare. The  particular branch of the Pythagorean system with which we are  concerned, is that which treats of the Music of the Spheres. Besides  the two passages here quoted, there are others dealing with this  subject--_e.g._,    _Ant._ V, ii, 84, 'the tuned spheres'; _Twelf._ III, i, 115, 'music  from the spheres'; _Per._ V, i, 226, 'The music of the spheres.'    'This, Pythagoras, first of all the Greeks [560 B.C.] conceived in his  mind; and understood that the spheres sounded something concordant,  because of the necessity of proportion, which never forsakes celestial  beings.'[22]    [Footnote 22: Hist. of Philos., by Thomas Stanley, edit. 1701.]    'Pythagoras, by musical proportion, calleth that a tone, by how much  the moon is distant from the earth: from the moon to Mercury the half  of that space, and from Mercury to Venus almost as much; from Venus to  the Sun, sesquiple [_i.e._, half as much more as a tone]; from the Sun  to Mars, a tone, that is as far as the moon is from the earth: from  Mars to Jupiter, half, and from Jupiter to Saturn, half, and thence to  the zodiac, sesquiple.'    'Thus there are made _seven tones_, which they call a _diapason_  harmony, that is, an _universal concent_, in which Saturn moves in the  Doric mood, Jupiter in the Phrygian, and in the rest the like.'    'Those sounds which the seven planets, and the sphere of fixed stars,  and that which is above us, termed by them Antichton [opposite the  earth], make, Pythagoras affirmed to be the Nine Muses; but the  composition and symphony ... he named Mnemosyne [Memory, the Mother of  the Muses].'    Censorinus, a Roman Grammarian, B.C. 238, in his book De Die Natali,  says--    'To these things we may add what Pythagoras taught, namely, that the  whole world was constructed according to musical ratio, and that"]]]
