This  preparation is, in our opinion, undesirable on account of its liability  to become rancid and vaseline should be the excipient used. Another  application for herpetic eruptions is the juice of the leaves mixed  with an equal quantity of lemon juice. The Malays use the leaves dried  in the sun, adding to them a little water and rubbing them briskly  on the affected parts, the vigorous treatment being an important part  of the cure.    The decoction of the leaves is a laxative and according to Mr. J. Wood  the tincture has an action similar to that of senna. Dr. Pulney Andy  of India states that the extract prepared from the tender leaves is  a good substitute for extract of colocynth.    Mr. A. Porte claims to have obtained the best results with an acetic  extract of the fresh leaves. The following is his formula:              Fresh leaves of _C. alata_          100 grams.          Acetic acid diluted in 2/3 water    450 grams.      Macerate 10 or 12 days, filter and express, then filter again and  evaporate to the consistency of an extract.    The seeds contain vermifuge principles.    The activity of this plant in herpes is due to the chrysophanic acid  contained in it. The more recent the eruption the more certain is  the effect.    The following species, all of which grow in the Philippines, contain  principles analogous to those of the _C. alata_, viz.: _C. sophera_,  L. and _C. tora_, L., called in Tagalo _manimanihan_.    Botanical Description.--A shrub, 7-9° high, with a straight, ramose  trunk 3-4' in diameter. Leaves 1 1/2-2° long, opposite, abruptly  pinnate, a thick stylet taking the place of the odd leaflet. Leaflets  10-13 pairs, the smaller ones 1-2' long. Common petiole with 2  horizontal stipules at the base. Flowers in conspicuous, erect  racemes. Calyx, 5 free concave, unequal sepals. Corolla, 5 petals of  a beautiful yellow color. Stamens perigynous, 10 in number, 3 upper  ones very small and frequently sterile, 3 lower very large. The  bilocular anthers open by 2 pores. Ovary many-ovuled with filiform  style. Pod long with 2 prominent wings on the sides and many seeds  which slightly resemble a cross with blunt ends.    The _C. sophera_, L., is characterized by 10 stamens, all fertile  and a smooth, linear, bivalved pod full of seeds separated by false  partitions. The _C. tora_, L., bears a quadrangular pod about 15  centimeters long by 2 in diameter.    Habitat.--Grows in all parts of the islands and is universally known  by the natives. Blooms in May.        _Tamarindus Indica_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Tamarindo_, Sp.; _Sampalok_, Tag., Pam., Bik.; _Sambak_,  _Sumalagi_, _Kamalagi_, Vis.; _Tamarind_, Eng.    Uses.--The pulp of the fruit is used to make a sort of sweet preserve  and is very popular among the Filipinos. They prepare a refreshing  drink from the pulp mixed with sweetened water and believing it to  be beneficial to the liver, stomach and blood, they use too much  of it. Its excessive use is rather prejudicial to the health, but  given in moderation it is very efficient in allaying the thirst of  fever patients. The pulp contains weak laxative properties and it  is customary to administer it in solution with cream of tartar. Its  chemical composition is as follows:                      Citric acid             9.40                  Tartaric acid           1.55                  Malic acid              0.45                  Potassium bitartrate    3.25                  Sugar                  12.50                  Gum                     4.70                  Vegetable gelatin       6.25                  Parenchyma             34.35                  Water                  27.55                                                (Vauquelin.)      At the end of any sickness, especially after labor, the first bath  given to the convalescent is with a decoction of the leaves of the  \"sampaloc,\" to prevent convulsions, the native herb-doctors say.    Botanical Description.--A large tree, somewhat resembling the elm in  contour, with leaves opposite, abruptly pinnate. Leaflets 12 or more  pairs, linear, with a notch at the apex, entire, glabrous. Flowers  yellow-white, spattered dark red, racemose. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla,  5 lanceolate petals with crispate borders. Stamens monadelphous,  dividing into 7 filaments above. The ripe pod is chocolate color,  oblong, slightly compressed, straight or curved, 6-15 centimeters  long, full of a light-brown pulp in which rest the seeds enveloped in  a cellular membrane. These seeds are flattened, almost quadrangular;  testa hard, of a chestnut color, shiny and without albumen.    Habitat.--Very common everywhere in the islands. Blooms in May.        _Bauhinia malabarica_, Roxb. (_B. tomentosa_, Wall. and Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Alibangbang_, Tag., Vis., Pam.    Uses.--The leaves of this tree and of the species _B. tomentosa_,  L., are quite acid and the Filipinos use them as an ingredient of  many dishes. The fresh flowers possess anti-dysenteric virtues for  which purpose they are given internally in infusion of 10-20 grams  of the flowers to one-half liter of water. The decoction of the root  bark is a common remedy for liver troubles along the coast of Malabar  according to Rheede.    Botanical Description.--A tree 20° high, with leaves alternate,  peltate, slightly cordate, orbicular, the apex divided into two large  lobules with a stylet between them, glabrous above, somewhat downy  beneath; 2 large, flat glandules are situated at the base. Petioles  short. Flowers cymose. Peduncle long. Calyx inferior, funnelform,  with 4-5 sepals as long as the corolla. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens  10, 5 alternate ones longer than the others. Stigma thick, peltate,  2 lobules. Pod 1° long, with linear stalk, containing many seeds  separated by filamentous isthmuses.    Habitat.--Common everywhere. Blooms in November.          LEGUMINOSÆ.    Mimosa Division.        _Entada scandens_, Benth. (_E. Pursoetha_, DC. and Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Gogo_, Tag.; _Bayogo_, _Balogo_, _Gohong bakay_, Vis. and  Pam.; _Gilla Nuts_, Indo-Eng.    Uses.--The use made of the mashed bark of this tree is well known  throughout the Philippines. Cut in strips and beaten thoroughly between  stones it is sold under the name of \"gogo\"; it is macerated in water,  to which it imparts a reddish color, and forms a substitute for  soap. The Filipinos use this preparation for bathing, especially  the hair, for which purpose there is no more useful or simple  preparation. It cures pityriasis, and renders the hair very soft,  without drying it too much as is usually the case with soap. The  natives use it in treating the itch, washing the affected parts with  the maceration and at the same time briskly rubbing them with the  bark; in this way they remove the crusts that shield the acari. The  treatment is successful in direct proportion to the energy of rubbing.    The seeds of \"gogo\" are very large, lenticular, flattened, 3-4  centimeters in diameter. Their chemical composition has been studied by  Pettit. Alcohol dissolves the active principle, perhaps a glucoside,  the study of which the author has not completed. Five centigrams of  this substance administered to a guinea-pig causes paralysis of the  hind quarters without any apparent inflammation. He also found saponin  in the seeds, but it exists in much greater quantity in the trunk. In  the Sunda Islands they eat the seeds roasted and also extract from  them an illuminating oil.    The maceration of gogo is emetic and purgative; it is used in the  treatment of asthma; it is exceedingly irritating, the slightest  quantity that enters the eye causing severe smarting and a slight  conjunctivitis for one or two days.    Botanical Description.--A high climbing shrub with stem as much as  7-8' in diameter. Leaves opposite, twice abruptly pinnate, a stylet  replacing the terminal leaflet; 5 pairs of elliptical leaflets, entire,  glabrous and notched at the apex. Common petiole with 2 stipules  at the base. Flowers in delicate spikes. Calyx obliquely truncate,  5-toothed. Corolla, 5 oval petals much larger than the calyx. Stamens  10-13. Filaments longer than the corolla. Anther with 1-2 white,  globose glandules. Pod woody, 4-6° long by \"4 fingers\" broad, with  large notches on the borders, many compartments containing many large,  compressed, circular seeds with dark-colored testa, 3-4 centimeters  in diameter.    Habitat.--Mountains of Luzon and Panay. Blooms in May.        _Parkia Roxburghii_, G. Don. (_P. brunonis_, Grah.; _P. biglobosa_,  Benth.; _Mimosa peregrina_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Kopang_, Tag.    Uses.--The fruit is edible. Its pulp is golden yellow with a sweetish  taste and an odor like that of violets.    The roasted seeds are used in certain parts of Africa to make  an infusion like coffee, for which reason they have been called  \"Soudan Coffee.\"    The pulp was analyzed by Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen in 1887;  it contains 60% of its weight of sugar (a mixture of dextrose and  levulose), 0.98% of free tartaric and citric acids, fats, albuminoids,  etc.    Botanical Description.--A large tree of the first order. Leaves  opposite, twice abruptly pinnate. Leaflets small, linear, more  than 40 pairs. Principal petiole with one glandule at the base  and often another higher up. Calyx long, tubular, with 5 unequal  lobules. Corolla, 5 equal petals. Stamens 10, monadelphous. Ovary  free, unilocular, multi-ovulate. Pod, 1° × 1', woody, much compressed,  brown, with many seeds embedded in a yellow pulp.    Habitat.--Abounds in the provinces of central Luzon. Blooms in  December.        _Acacia Farnesiana_, Willd. (_A. Indica_, Desv.; _Mimosa Farnesiana_,  L. and Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--Aroma, Sp.; Cassie Flower, Eng.    Uses.--The trunk bark is astringent and in decoction is of use in the  treatment of prolapsed rectum and as an injection for leucorrhoea. A  poultice of the tender leaves is applied to ulcers and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2641"],[0,"A Room with a View (#19)"],[1,"that she is alive. After a moment, he  contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain  approval. He forebore to repress the sources of youth.    Nature--simplest of topics, he thought--lay around them. He praised the  pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted  the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road. The  outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went  wrong in a question of fact. Mrs. Honeychurch's mouth twitched when he  spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.    \"I count myself a lucky person,\" he concluded, \"When I'm in London I  feel I could never live out of it. When I'm in the country I feel the  same about the country. After all, I do believe that birds and trees and  the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who  live amongst them must be the best. It's true that in nine cases out of  ten they don't seem to notice anything. The country gentleman and  the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of  companions. Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings  of Nature which is denied to us of the town. Do you feel that, Mrs.  Honeychurch?\"    Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled. She had not been attending.  Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt  irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.    Lucy had not attended either. Her brow was wrinkled, and she still  looked furiously cross--the result, he concluded, of too much moral  gymnastics. It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an  August wood.    \"'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,'\" he quoted, and  touched her knee with his own.    She flushed again and said: \"What height?\"    \"'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives  in height (the shepherd sang). In height and in the splendour of the  hills?' Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch's advice and hate clergymen no  more. What's this place?\"    \"Summer Street, of course,\" said Lucy, and roused herself.    The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.  Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was  occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled  spire. Mr. Beebe's house was near the church. In height it scarcely  exceeded the cottages. Some great mansions were at hand, but they were  hidden in the trees. The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the  shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly  little villas--the villas that had competed with Cecil's engagement,  having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had  been acquired by Cecil.    \"Cissie\" was the name of one of these villas, \"Albert\" of the other.  These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden  gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed  the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. \"Albert\"  was inhabited. His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and  lobelias and polished shells. His little windows were chastely swathed  in Nottingham lace. \"Cissie\" was to let. Three notice-boards, belonging  to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising  fact. Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn  was yellow with dandelions.    \"The place is ruined!\" said the ladies mechanically. \"Summer Street will  never be the same again.\"    As the carriage passed, \"Cissie's\" door opened, and a gentleman came out  of her.    \"Stop!\" cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.  \"Here's Sir Harry. Now we shall know. Sir Harry, pull those things down  at once!\"    Sir Harry Otway--who need not be described--came to the carriage and  said \"Mrs. Honeychurch, I meant to. I can't, I really can't turn out  Miss Flack.\"    \"Am I not always right? She ought to have gone before the contract was  signed. Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew's time?\"    \"But what can I do?\" He lowered his voice. \"An old lady, so very vulgar,  and almost bedridden.\"    \"Turn her out,\" said Cecil bravely.    Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully. He had had full  warning of Mr. Flack's intentions, and might have bought the plot before  building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory. He had known  Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being  spoilt. Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the  apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.  He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,--a most reasonable and  respectful man--who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic  roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper. He ventured to differ,  however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches  to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked  to relieve the facade by a bit of decoration. Sir Harry hinted that a  column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.    Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, \"and  all the capitals different--one with dragons in the foliage, another  approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack's  initials--everyone different.\" For he had read his Ruskin. He built  his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an  immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.    This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness  as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch's carriage. He had failed in his duties  to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.  He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.  All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for \"Cissie\"--some  one really desirable.    \"The rent is absurdly low,\" he told them, \"and perhaps I am an easy  landlord. But it is such an awkward size. It is too large for the  peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.\"    Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or  despise Sir Harry for despising them. The latter impulse seemed the more  fruitful.    \"You ought to find a tenant at once,\" he said maliciously. \"It would be  a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.\"    \"Exactly!\" said Sir Harry excitedly. \"That is exactly what I fear, Mr.  Vyse. It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has  improved--a fatal improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from  a station in these days of bicycles?\"    \"Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,\" said Lucy.    Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied  that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a  most appalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless  neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.    \"Sir Harry!\" she exclaimed, \"I have an idea. How would you like  spinsters?\"    \"My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?\"    \"Yes; I met them abroad.\"    \"Gentlewomen?\" he asked tentatively.    \"Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless. I heard from them last  week--Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan. I'm really not joking. They  are quite the right people. Mr. Beebe knows them, too. May I tell them  to write to you?\"    \"Indeed you may!\" he cried. \"Here we are with the difficulty solved  already. How delightful it is! Extra facilities--please tell them they  shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents' fees. Oh,  the agents! The appalling people they have sent me! One woman, when  I wrote--a tactful letter, you know--asking her to explain her social  position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance. As  if one cares about that! And several references I took up were most  unsatisfactory--people swindlers, or not respectable. And oh, the  deceit! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. The  deceit of the most promising people. My dear Lucy, the deceit!\"    She nodded.    \"My advice,\" put in Mrs. Honeychurch, \"is to have nothing to do with  Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all. I know the type. Preserve me  from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them  that make the house smell stuffy. It's a sad thing, but I'd far rather  let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has  come down.\"    \"I think I follow you,\" said Sir Harry; \"but it is, as you say, a very  sad thing.\"    \"The Misses Alan aren't that!\" cried Lucy.    \"Yes, they are,\" said Cecil. \"I haven't met them but I should say they  were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.\"    \"Don't listen to him, Sir Harry--he's tiresome.\"    \"It's I who am tiresome,\" he replied. \"I oughtn't to come with my  troubles to young people. But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway  will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no  real help.\"    \"Then may I write to my Misses Alan?\"    \"Please!\"    But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed:    \"Beware! They are certain to have canaries. Sir Harry, beware of  canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then  the mice come. Beware of women altogether. Only let to a man.\"    \"Really--\" he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her  remark.    \"Men don't gossip over tea-cups. If they get drunk, there's an end of  them--they lie down comfortably and sleep it off. If they're vulgar,  they somehow keep it to themselves. It doesn't spread so. Give me a  man--of course, provided he's clean.\"    Sir Harry blushed. Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments  to their sex. Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much  distinction. He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should  descend from the carriage and inspect \"Cissie\" for herself. She was  delighted. Nature had intended her to be poor and to"]]]
