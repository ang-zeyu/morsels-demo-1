See that the fins and tail are uninjured, and that no  scales are missing from the side to be displayed. As every perfectly  formed fish has both sides alike, and as ordinarily but one side can be  seen at a time, only a little more than one half of the fish is to be  mounted.    Note carefully the colors (including those of the eye and the interior  of the mouth) of the freshly caught fish, making a sketch of the  specimen, showing the extent of the different colors and markings, the  spots, if any, and the eye. The pupil is not usually round. The eye of a  lake trout appears like Fig. 1. A carefully kept note book is a valuable  aid.    [Illustration: Fig. 1 Eye of Lake Trout]    While the tail is of course a fin (the caudal), in this work it will be  called the \"tail,\" to distinguish it from the other fins. See Fig. 2 for  key to the names of the fins.    [Illustration: FISH IN MOULD. (Fig. 2.)    Names of fins: D--Dorsal, A--Adipose, C--Caudal (tail), P--Pectoral,  V--Ventral, An--Anal.]    THE MOLD.--Wash the fish in water to remove dirt and mucus. On a board  somewhat longer and wider than the fish, place a sufficient amount of  moist sand in which to imbed the specimen to one-half its depth when  lying on its side in the desired position. Level the sand and hollow it  out for the larger part of the body. Large fish should be displayed  straight, with the mouth closed or only slightly open. Smaller and more  graceful ones may be shown in positions of activity; rising to fly,  breaking away, etc. If the mouth is to be open, fill it with cotton or  cloth in order to keep out the plaster. Place the fish in the position  you wish it to have when mounted, the side to be displayed uppermost.  See that the dorsal and anal fins, and the tail, lie flat on the sand,  and that one-half the body appears above the sand its entire length.  There must be no uneven places. Viewed from the end, it should appear  like Fig. 3; from the side, like Fig. 4.    [Illustration: END VIEW. (Fig. 3)]    [Illustration: SIDE VIEW. (Fig. 4)]    Heap up the sand all around, about an inch from the fish, to prevent the  plaster flowing off the board.    Mix a sufficient amount of plaster to cover the fish to a depth of about  half an inch, covering the fins and tail as well as the body. Mix the  plaster by stirring a little at a time into cold water until it has the  consistency of cream. Place the pectoral and ventral fins flat against  the body. Pour the plaster over the fish slowly and evenly (covering the  head, tail and edges first), allowing it time to dry until quite hard,  perhaps thirty to forty minutes. Then turn the mold over (it will appear  like Fig. 2) and, by inserting the fingers in the gills, carefully  remove the fish. Lay the mold aside for a time. Wash all sand and  plaster from the fish.    [Illustration: INCISIONS TO BE MADE. (Fig. 5)]    SKINNING THE FISH.--If the fish has scales easily dislodged, wrap it,  with the exception of the fins and tail, in several thicknesses of  tissue paper, which will readily adhere to the moist skin. Lay the fish  on your table, on the side which was covered by the plaster and place  wet cloths on the fins and tail to prevent drying. Commence at the gills  and make two cuts with the scissors or scalpel lengthwise of the fish to  the tail, cutting into the abdominal cavity below, joining these cuts  (see Fig. 5), removing the strip of skin, including the pectoral fin,  with adhering flesh, and the contents of the cavity.    With the fingers, or tweezers, grasp the cut edge of the skin of the  back and with the scalpel carefully separate it from the flesh as far as  the middle line of the back from the head to the tail. Remove the  exposed flesh to the backbone. With the knife, shears or fine tooth saw,  split the head lengthwise a little to one side of the middle, leaving  somewhat more than half. Do not sever the skin of the body where it  comes to a point between the gills, and use great care when removing the  flesh from this portion.    You now have a trifle more than one-half the fish to work on. With the  scissors cut through the ribs and remove the backbone with some of the  flesh. Be careful when cutting through the backbone at the tail not to  cut through the skin below. Going back to the head, remove the remaining  flesh, and with the curved scissors and scalpel cut away all the  cartilage possible from the head; the more the better so long as the  skin is not injured. If enough of the cartilage can be removed to expose  the muscles of the cheek from the inside, cut them away, taking out the  eye; otherwise it will be necessary to work from the outside of the skin  through the eye opening, and this must be done very carefully or the  skin of the cheek may be broken. With most fishes it is possible to  remove all the cartilage from the head, and this should be done to  prevent shrinkage. If the mouth is to be open, do not cut away its  lining or much of the tongue behind. The tongue is to be split  perpendicularly lengthwise and about one-third of it removed. When the  head has been thoroughly cleaned, remove the remaining flesh from the  body with the skin scraper or scalpel.    The ventral fin which is uppermost as the fish lies on its side and is  not to show, should be carefully cut off outside the skin. Do not cut  off the ventral fin on the side which is to be displayed. Do not scrape  away the silvery lining of the skin if this can be avoided. Some of it  will come off. Cut away the bases of all the fins and the tail inside  with the curved scissors and scrape away all flesh, working close to the  fingers so as not to stretch the skin. Tie the vent inside with thread.  Unless the fish is quite small, the skin of the lower jaw must be  loosened with the knife or scalpel and the muscles cut away. The  adipose, or small fleshy fin on the back near the tail of such fishes as  the trout, must be carefully opened from the inside of the skin with a  small-bladed knife and the contents removed, to be later replaced with  clay.    Place the skin in water to loosen the paper--if any has been  used--carefully washing the skin and wetting the fins and tail  thoroughly. You may allow the skin to remain in the water until you are  ready to put it back in the mold, but not longer than a few hours.    FILLING.--Brush the sand from the mold, and if the upper edge is uneven,  smooth it with a knife so that it will be perfectly straight. Should  there be any rough places on the inside of the mold, carefully scrape  them down with the skin scraper.    [Illustration: INSIDE BOARD. (Fig. 6)]    Cut out roughly a piece of soft pine one-half to one inch thick the  shape of the outline of the fish, but somewhat smaller, using the mold  as a guide. One side will, of course, be flat, and that side should be  uppermost when placed in the mold. Work up with water a sufficient  quantity of clay to about the consistency of fresh putty. Place the mold  on your bench or table, resting it on something soft (such as a piece of  old carpet or burlap) to prevent its breaking. Drain the water from the  skin and put it back into the mold, adjusting it nicely. The median line  will guide you. See that the head, fins and tail occupy the same places  they did before. Pour a little alcohol on the skin inside and let it run  along the bases of the fins and tail, over the entire inner surface of  the skin and into the head to preserve any bits of flesh that may  possibly remain. Drain off the surplus alcohol. Fill the adipose fin (if  the fish has one) with clay. Sprinkle powdered arsenic over the entire  inside of the skin and head. Do not use more than will readily adhere.    The chances are that you removed more or less of the silvery lining of  the skin. Whether you did or not, cover the entire inner surface of the  skin of the cheek and body with two or three thicknesses of aluminum  leaf. Do not cover the entire surface at once. Cover a small part at a  time, and then put on top of the leaf enough clay to cover it,  commencing at the head and continuing to the tail. Replace the muscles  and cartilage of the head with clay. Be sure to keep the skin properly  adjusted to the mold. See that the fins and the tail remain in their  proper places and that they are kept covered with wet cloths.    Flatten out the clay (a small quantity at a time) with the fingers and  cover the inside of the skin to the depth of about one-eighth of an  inch, pressing it down firmly, especially at the bases of the fins and  tail and into the cheek and head. Fit in the piece of pine, cutting it  down as may be necessary. Its shape will be something like Fig. 6.    Mix some more plaster, and before putting in the piece of board, pour in  the plaster on the clay, filling the skin perhaps two-thirds full.  Quickly, before the plaster sets, put in the piece of wood, carefully  pressing it down into the plaster until it is level with the upper edge  of the mold, removing any surplus plaster quickly and neatly. Sew up the  skin from one edge to the other as shown in Fig. 7.    [Illustration: SEWING UP THE SKIN. (Fig. 7)]    REMOVING SPECIMEN FROM MOLD AND DRYING.--Lay a piece of clean board of  the proper size on top of the mold, turning both over. Lift up the mold  a trifle, gently shaking it. The fish may or may not come out. If not,  turn the mold back, insert "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#19)"],[1,"among its stately  brethren a beautiful moss-wreathed liberty-pole, flinging to the face  of heaven the glad colors of the Free.    When I attempt, dear M., to describe one of these spots to you, I  regret more than ever the ill health of my childhood, which prevented  my attaining any degree of excellence in sketching from nature. Had it  not been for that interruption to my artistic education, I might, with  a few touches of the pencil or the brush, give you the place and its  surroundings. But, alas! my feeble pen will convey to you a very faint  idea of its savage beauty.    This Bar is so small that it seems impossible that the tents and cabins  scattered over it can amount to a dozen. There are, however, twenty in  all, including those formed of calico shirts and pine boughs. With the  exception of the paths leading to the different tenements, the entire  level is covered with mining-holes, on the edges of which lie the  immense piles of dirt and stones which have been removed from the  excavations. There is a deep pit in front of our cabin, and another at  the side of it, though they are not worked, as, when \"prospected,\" they  did not \"yield the color.\"    Not a spot of verdure is to be seen on this place, but the glorious  hills rising on every side, vested in foliage of living green, make  ample amends for the sterility of the tiny level upon which we camp.  The surrounding scenery is infinitely more charming than that of Rich  Bar. The river, in hue of a vivid emerald, as if it reflected the hue  of the fir-trees above, bordered with a band of dark red, caused by the  streams flowing into it from the different sluices, ditches, long-toms,  etc., which meander from the hill just back of the Bar, wanders  musically along. Across the river, and in front of us, rises nearly  perpendicularly a group of mountains, the summits of which are broken  into many beautifully cut conical and pyramidal peaks. At the foot and  left of these eminences, and a little below our Bar, lies Missouri Bar,  which is reached from this spot by a log bridge. Around the latter the  river curves in the shape of a crescent, and, singularly enough, the  mountain rising behind this bend in the stream outlines itself against  the lustrous heaven in a shape as exact and perfect as the moon herself  in her first quarter. Within one horn of this crescent the water is a  mass of foam-sparkles, and it plays upon the rocks which line its bed  an everlasting dirge suggestive of the \"grand forever\" of the ocean.    At present the sun does not condescend to shine upon Indian Bar at all,  and the old settlers tell me that he will not smile upon us for the  next three months, but he nestles lovingly in patches of golden glory  all along the brows of the different hills around us, and now and then  stoops to kiss the topmost wave on the opposite shore of the Rio de las  Plumas.    The first artificial elegance which attracts your vision is a large rag  shanty, roofed, however, with a rude kind of shingles, over the  entrance of which is painted, in red capitals, (\"to what base uses do  we come at last,\") the name of the great Humboldt spelt without the  _d_. This is the only hotel in this vicinity, and as there is a really  excellent bowling-alley attached to it, and the barroom has a floor  upon which the miners can dance, and, above all, a cook who can play  the violin, it is very popular. But the clinking of glasses, and the  swaggering air of some of the drinkers, remind us that it is no place  for a lady, so we will pass through the dining-room, and, emerging at  the kitchen, in a step or two reach our log cabin. Enter, my dear; you  are perfectly welcome. Besides, we could not keep you out if we would,  as there is not even a latch on the canvas door, though we really  intend, in a day or two, to have a hook put onto it.    The room into which we have just entered is about twenty feet square.  It is lined over the top with white cotton cloth, the breadths of  which, being sewed together only in spots, stretch gracefully apart in  many places, giving one a bird's-eye view of the shingles above. The  sides are hung with a gaudy chintz, which I consider a perfect marvel  of calico-printing. The artist seems to have exhausted himself on  _roses_. From the largest cabbage down to the tiniest Burgundy, he has  arranged them in every possible variety of wreath, garland, bouquet,  and single flower. They are of all stages of growth, from earliest  budhood up to the ravishing beauty of the \"last rose of summer.\" Nor  has he confined himself to the colors usually worn by this lovely  plant, but, with the daring of a great genius soaring above nature,  worshiping the ideal rather than the real, he has painted them brown,  purple, green, black, and blue. It would need a floral catalogue to  give you the names of _all_ the varieties which bloom upon the calico,  but, judging by the shapes, which really are much like the originals, I  can swear to moss-roses, Burgundies, York and Lancaster, tea-roses, and  multifloras.    A curtain of the above-described chintz (I shall hem it at the first  opportunity) divides off a portion of the room, behind which stands a  bedstead that in ponderosity leaves the Empire couches far behind. But  before I attempt the furniture let me finish describing the cabin  itself.    The fireplace is built of stones and mud, the chimney finished off with  alternate layers of rough sticks and this same rude mortar. Contrary to  the usual custom, it is built inside, as it was thought that  arrangement would make the room more comfortable, and you may imagine  the queer appearance of this unfinished pile of stones, mud, and  sticks. The mantelpiece (remember that on this portion of a great  building some artists, by their exquisite workmanship, have become  world-renowned) is formed of a beam of wood covered with strips of tin  procured from cans, upon which still remain, in black hieroglyphics,  the names of the different eatables which they formerly contained. Two  smooth stones (how delightfully primitive!) do duty as fire-dogs. I  suppose that it would be no more than civil to call a hole two feet  square, in one side of the room, a window, although it is as yet  guiltless of glass. F. tried to coax the proprietor of the Empire to  let him have a window from that pine-and-canvas palace, but he, of  course, declined, as to part with it would really inconvenience  himself. So F. has sent to Marysville for some glass, though it is the  general opinion that the snow will render the trail impassible for  mules before we can get it. In this case we shall tack up a piece of  cotton cloth, and should it chance at any time to be very cold, hang a  blanket before the opening. At present the weather is so mild that it  is pleasanter as it is, though we have a fire in the mornings and  evenings, more, however, for luxury than because we really need it. For  my part, I almost hope that we shall not be able to get any glass, for  you will perhaps remember that it was a pet habit of mine, in my own  room, to sit by a great fire, in the depth of winter, with my window  open.    One of our friends had nailed up an immense quantity of unhemmed cotton  cloth--very coarse--in front of this opening, and as he evidently  prided himself upon the elegant style in which he had arranged the  drapery, it went to my heart to take it down and suspend in its place  some pretty blue linen curtains which I had brought from the valley. My  toilet-table is formed of a trunk elevated upon two claret-cases, and  by draping it with some more of the blue linen neatly fringed, it  really will look quite handsome, and when I have placed upon it my  rosewood workbox, a large cushion of crimson brocade, some Chinese  ornaments of exquisitely carved ivory, and two or three Bohemian-glass  cologne-stands, it would not disgrace a lady's chamber at home.    The looking-glass is one of those which come in paper cases for dolls'  houses. How different from the full-length psyches so almost  indispensable to a dressing-room in the States!    The wash-stand is another trunk, covered with a towel, upon which you  will see, for bowl, a large vegetable-dish, for ewer, a common-sized  dining-pitcher. Near this, upon a small cask, is placed a pail, which  is daily filled with water from the river. I brought with me from  Marysville a handsome carpet, a hair mattress, pillows, a profusion of  bed-linen, quilts, blankets, towels, etc., so that, in spite of the  oddity of most of my furniture, I am, in reality, as thoroughly  comfortable here as I could be in the most elegant palace.    We have four chairs, which were brought from the Empire. I seriously  proposed having three-legged stools. With my usual desire for symmetry,  I thought that they would be more in keeping; but as I was told that it  would be a great deal of trouble to get them made, I was fain to put up  with mere chairs. So you see that even in the land of gold itself one  cannot have everything that she desires. An ingenious individual in the  neighborhood, blessed with a large bump for mechanics, and good nature,  made me a sort of wide bench, which, covered with a neat plaid, looks  quite sofa-like. A little pine table, with oilcloth tacked over the top  of it, stands in one corner of the room, upon which are arranged the  chess and cribbage boards. There is a larger one for dining purposes,  and as unpainted pine has always a most dreary look, F. went everywhere  in search of oilcloth for it, but there was none at any of the bars. At  last, \"Ned,\" the Humboldt Paganini, remembered two old monte-table  covers which had been thrown aside as useless. I received them  thankfully, and, with my planning and Ned's mechanical genius, we  patched up quite a respectable covering. To be sure, the ragged  condition of the primitive material compelled us to have at one end an  extra border, but that only agreeably"]]]
