Unluckily he held just enough authority to be able to carry out his  threat. Power had hitherto been to him an unknown weapon. He had been  given the position of acting foreman of the new patent leather factory  only because of his long term of service with the company. It was  understood that he was to hold the post until a skilled and competent  foreman could be found; but while he enjoyed the distinction of \"boss\"  he made as arrogant use of his sovereignty as he could.    From the first he blocked the way for Peter and Nat, not only by  refusing to pass on to them any information, but by influencing the  other men to follow his example. Whether he feared Peter Strong might  usurp the vacant foremanship, or whether he simply cherished a grudge  toward the lad because of his previous good fortune, it was impossible  to discover. Whichever the case, his attitude was, from the moment the  boys set foot in the new tannery, one of complete antagonism. Had it not  been for Peter's agreement not to intrude his personal grievances at  home it would have been easy to appeal to his father to straighten out  the difficulty. But Peter would not for a moment consider this means of  escape. Therefore he and Nat struggled on by themselves, picking up what  scraps of information they were able. Try as they would they could wring  from the workmen only the most meager facts about making patent leather.    They did succeed in finding out that the shiny varnish which gave it its  finish was compounded in an isolated brick house in the factory yard  where, after the ingredients had been carefully measured out, the  mixture was boiled at a tremendous heat in great kettles. The formula  for this dressing was a secret and was the result of many chemical  experiments. All Peter and Nat could learn was that there was oil and  Prussian blue in it, and something else with a stifling odor which  caused it to dry quickly. No one was allowed in the room where, in the  intense heat, the mixers--almost naked--toiled amid the clouds of steam  which rose from the bubbling kettles. After the liquid had reached the  necessary degree of temperature it was poured out into tanks where it  was prevented from settling by being constantly agitated by the gentle  motion of revolving paddles. Here it was kept until taken to the  \"slickers\" to be used.    \"And the reason that the building stands off by itself,\" declared Nat to  Peter one day, \"is because there is danger of the oil and stuff in the  varnish taking fire or blowing up; I found that out from one of the men  to-day. In that other low building off by itself are stored the supplies  for making the varnish and that place has to be isolated too for the  same reason.\"    \"Good for you, Nat! We've gained one point anyhow. Did you find out  anything else?\"    \"No. When the man saw that I was really interested he wouldn't tell me  anything more. There is, though, a nice old Irishman--a friend of  Carmachel's--here somewhere. I met him once at noon time over at the  park. Maybe he will help us.\"    \"There are plenty of things that I want to ask him if he ever turns up,\"  Peter replied. \"I only hope he will be decent to us. I am sure he would  if he knew how hard we are trying to learn. One thing I am anxious to  know is why on earth they don't dry the freshly varnished patent leather  in the factory. Look at the work it makes for the men to bring it out  here in the yard and stand it up against these hundreds of wooden racks.  I should think by this time it would have dawned on somebody that it  would be lots less trouble to dry it indoors in a hot room; shouldn't  you?\"    But it wasn't Nat who answered. Instead a voice with a decided Irish  brogue replied kindly:    \"Well, you see, my lad, no way has ever been found to dry patent leather  except by the sun's rays. If somebody could invent a kind of japan that  would dry in the house his fortune would be made. But nobody ever has.  Every fine day the hundreds of frames have to be brought out and propped  up in the sun--a jolly bit of work, I can tell you!\"    \"But suppose it should rain?\" questioned Peter, eager to get all the  information he could out of the friendly workman.    \"If the weather is bad of course we do not put out the leather; in case  a sudden storm comes up while it is out the factory whistle sounds and  every man understands that he is to drop whatever he is doing, no matter  what it is, and rush to the yard to help rescue the stock before it is  spoiled.\"    \"I never heard of anything so funny!\" cried Peter.    \"Funny, is it? You'll not be thinking so when you have to take your turn  at it,\" protested the Irishman, grimly. \"Just you be busy at doing some  fussy thing you can't leave and wait till you hear the blast of the  whistle! Out you'll have to cut and run like as if you were a schoolboy  going through a fire drill. Then, you see, there are all those frames of  wet leather to be set up somewhere indoors where they won't be injured  until the storm is over and they can be carried out again.\"    \"And suppose the stormy weather lasts several days?\"    \"No leather can be dried. Nor can you put it out on very dusty days lest  the particles in the air stick on the moist surface and dry there. A  strong wind is another bad thing, because it catches the frames as if  they were sails and often smashes them all to pieces, spoiling the  leather stretched on them.\"    \"Well, it does seem as if somebody might be smart enough to think of  some plan to prevent all this. Have people tried--lots of people, I  mean--to make a gloss that will not need the sun to dry it?\"    \"Many and many a man has experimented and failed,\" replied the workman.  \"For years chemists have been working at the puzzle, but so far they  never have got anywhere.\"    \"If I only knew more about chemistry I'd try,\" cried Peter.    The old man looked amused at the boy's enthusiasm.    \"Would you, indeed!\" grinned he. \"Well, if you succeeded you would be  the first. But I'm not discouraging you, sonny. Sure if none of us were  young and hopeful nothing great would be done in the world. You sound as  if you might be Peter Strong--the lad they talk so much of in the other  factories.\"    \"I am Peter Strong.\"    \"I might have guessed it! Carmachel said I'd know you because you had  the strength of a tiger cub, the smile of the sun across the lake of  Killarney, and the courage of a fighting cock. It's good to see you,  laddie, starting out to move the world. I was going to do it once  myself, but somehow I never did. It does no harm, though, to set out  thinking you're going to budge the universe. Now listen to me. There is  no kindly feeling toward you two boys in this place. Tolman is scared  that you'll get his job away from him, so he's sore on your being sent  here; the men are afraid of him so they side with him. Let me give you a  bit of advice: work the best you can and have little to say to those  around you. If you want to find out things keep your questions until  you see me outside and I'll tell you all you want to know. I have been  here twenty years, and what I can't answer I can ask. We'll beat Tolman  yet, the three of us!\"    And so to the kindly old McCarthy Peter and Nat entrusted their  fortunes.    \"I do believe we are going to like it at this factory, after all,\"  announced Peter to Nat. \"Certainly we shall not want for excitement.  There is the chance to invent a better patent leather varnish which will  dry indoors; there is the chance to learn the mystery of making patent  leather despite Tolman; and there is the daily liability of having to  tear out into the yard and rescue the stock from a sudden shower. It is  going to be great sport, Nat!\"    But Nat was not so sanguine.    Being a toggle-boy was far from easy work.    \"And what is a toggle-boy?\" inquired Mrs. Jackson at the end of their  first day.    Peter and Nat only laughed.    They enjoyed using big words that mystified her.    \"Why, you see, Mother, toggle-boys are what we are at present,\" said  Nat, teasingly.    \"But what does one have to do to be a toggle-boy?\" persisted she.    \"I am afraid a toggle-boy is not as grand a person as he sounds, Mrs.  Jackson,\" interrupted Peter. \"Nat and I are down at the lowest rung of  the ladder again. We couldn't get much lower unless they set us to  making the wooden frames the leather is stretched on before it is  japanned. Somebody has to do that. The frames are about three yards long  and two yards wide, roughly speaking; it isn't much work to make them,  though, because the light thin boards come cut just the right size and  simply have to be nailed together at the corners. Still I should not  want to be set to doing carpentry. Even a toggle-boy's work is better  than that--eh, Nat?\"    \"He is at least an inch nearer making leather,\" admitted Nat grudgingly.    \"Of course he is! You see, Mrs. Jackson, Nat isn't stuck on his present  job. I shouldn't be either if I expected to do it for life. It is not a  position that inspires you with the feeling that you are well on your  way toward being a captain of industry,\" Peter chuckled. \"No, I'm afraid  there is more than one step between being a toggle-boy and being  president of the company.\"    Nat smiled in spite of himself.    \"Now, Mrs. Jackson, to make our career a little clearer to you I'll tell  you more about the toggle-boys,\" Peter continued. \"When the dyed leather  is sent over from the other factories to be made into patent leather it  is first stretched on the wooden frames, as I told you, so that the  gloss can be put on. The reason why they stretch the leather on frames  instead of boards is because a frame, being open, allows the wet japan  to run off the edges of the material and drip through to the floor as it  could not do if it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25828"],[0,"History of Australia and New Zealand (#19)"],[1,"in hopes of prosperity to come. Nor had they very long to  wait; in 1844 they were able to export corn to the extent of L40,000,  and in that year the colony possessed 355,000 sheep and 22,000 cattle.    The new Governor, Captain George Grey, took every care to assist the  colonists in returning to more prudent courses. Many changes were  needed; for in 1840, while the colony had a revenue of only L30,000, it  had spent at the rate of L171,000 per annum. Such imprudence could lead  to nothing but ruin, and the first task of the Governor was to reduce  all expenses as far as possible. In the first year the expenditure was  cut down to L90,000; in the next, to L68,000; and in 1843, to L34,000.    Instead of employing the poorer labourers on costly and unnecessary  public works, he persuaded them to take employment in the country with  the farmers and squatters, who were rapidly opening up the interior  parts of the colony. He settled many on small farms or stations of their  own, but in this he was greatly impeded by the high price of land; for  Wakefield's friends in England were not yet convinced that their  favourite scheme was defective--they attributed every mishap to the  incompetence of Governors Hindmarsh and Gawler. \"To lower the price,\"  said they, \"will be to ruin the colony;\" and lest such a thing should  happen, they raised the price of all lands, whether good or bad, to one  pound per acre. But many of those who had bought land in the first days  of the settlement had been so anxious to part with it during the crisis  that they had sold it for much less than it cost them; and thus a great  number of the poorer people became possessed of land at very moderate  prices. In 1839 there were but 440 acres under cultivation; three years  afterwards there were 23,000 acres bearing wheat, and 5,000 acres of  other crops. So rich and fertile was the soil that, in 1845, the  colonists not only raised enough of corn to supply their own wants,  but were able to export about 200,000 bushels at cheap rates to the  neighbouring colonies, and even then were left with 150,000 bushels,  which they could neither sell nor use. So rapid a development of  resources and so sudden an accession of prosperity have probably never  occurred in the history of any other country.      #2. Mineral Wealth.#--Such was the success attendant upon careful  industry, exercised with prudence, and under favourable circumstances;  but the colony was to owe yet more to accidental good fortune. During  the year 1841, a carrier, while driving his team of bullocks over the  Mount Lofty Range, had been obliged, by the steepness of the road, to  fasten a log to the back of his waggon in order to steady the load and  prevent its descending too quickly. As the log dragged roughly behind on  the road, it tore great furrows in the soil, and in one of these the  carrier noticed a stone which glanced and glittered like a metal. On  looking more closely, he saw that there were large quantities of the  same substance lying near the surface of the earth in all directions.  Having taken some specimens with him, he made inquiries in Adelaide, and  learned that the substance he had discovered was galena, a mineral in  which sulphur is combined with lead and small quantities of silver. The  land on which this valuable ore had been found was soon purchased, and  mines opened upon it. At first there was a large profit obtained from  the enterprise; and though, in after years, the mines became exhausted,  yet they served to call the attention of the colonists to the  possibility of discovering more permanent and lucrative sources of  mineral wealth.      #3. Copper.#--At the Kapunda Station, about forty miles north-west of  Adelaide, there lived a squatter named Captain Bagot. One day, during  the year 1842, he sent his overseer--Mr. Dutton--to search for a number  of sheep which had strayed into the bush. After spending some time in  fruitless efforts, Mr. Dutton ascended a small hill in order to have a  more extensive view of the country, but still he saw nothing of the lost  sheep. On turning to descend, his attention was attracted by a bright  green rock jutting from the earth. It seemed to him peculiar, so he  broke a small piece off and carried it down to Captain Bagot's house,  where he and the captain examined the specimen, and came to the  conclusion that it consisted of the mineral malachite, containing copper  in combination with water and carbonic dioxide. They let no one know of  the discovery, but proceeded to apply for the land in the usual manner,  without breathing a word as to their purpose. The section of eighty  acres was advertised for a month, and then put up to auction; but as no  one was anxious for this barren piece of ground, they had no  competitors, and the land fell to them for the price of eighty pounds.  As soon as they became possessed of it, they threw off all appearance of  mystery, and commenced operations. During the first year the mines  yielded L4,000; during the next, L10,000; and for several years they  continued to enrich the two proprietors, until each had realised a  handsome fortune, when the land was bought by an English company.      #4. The Burra Mines.#--The discovery of copper at Kapunda caused much  excitement in the colony. Every one who possessed land examined it  carefully for the trace of any minerals it might contain; and soon it  was rumoured that, at a place about one hundred miles north of Adelaide,  a shepherd had found exceedingly rich specimens of copper ore. The land  on which these were discovered had not yet been sold by the Government,  and in great haste a company was formed to purchase it. This company  consisted of the merchants, professional men, and officials of Adelaide;  but a rival company was immediately started, consisting of shopkeepers  and tradesmen, together with the farmers of the country districts. The  former always maintained a haughty air, and soon came to be known  throughout the colony as the \"nobs\"; while they, in their turn, fixed on  their rivals the nickname of the \"snobs\". For a week or two the  jealousies of the companies ran high, but they were soon forced to make  a temporary union; for, according to the land laws of the colony, if any  one wished to buy a piece of land, he had to apply for it and have it  advertised for a month; it was then put up for auction, and he who  offered the highest price became the purchaser. But a month was a long  time to wait, and it was rumoured that a number of speculators were on  their way from Sydney to offer a large sum for the land, as soon as it  should be put up to auction. It was, therefore, necessary to take  immediate action. There was another regulation in the land laws,  according to which, if a person applied for 20,000 acres, and paid down  L20,000 in cash, he became at once the proprietor of the land. The  \"nobs\" determined to avail themselves of this arrangement; but when they  put their money together, they found they had not enough to pay so large  a sum. They therefore asked the \"snobs\" to join them, on the  understanding that, after the land had been purchased, the two companies  would make a fair division. By uniting their funds they raised the  required amount, and proceeded with great exultation to lodge the money.  But part of it was in the form of bills on the Adelaide banks; and as  the Governor refused to accept anything but cash, the companies were  almost in despair, until a few active members hunted up their friends in  Adelaide, and succeeded in borrowing the number of sovereigns required  to make up the deficiency. The money was paid into the Treasury, the two  companies were the possessors of the land, and the Sydney speculators  arrived a few days too late.    Now came the division of the 20,000 acres. A line was drawn across the  middle; a coin was tossed up to decide which of the two should have the  first choice, and fortune favoured the \"snobs,\" who selected the  northern half, called by the natives Burra Burra. To the southern part  the \"nobs\" gave the name of \"Princess Royal\". The companies soon began  operations; but though the two districts appeared on the surface to be  of almost equal promise, yet, on being laid open, the Princess Royal was  soon found to be in reality poor, while the Burra Burra mines provided  fortunes for each of the fortunate \"snobs\". During the three years after  their discovery they yielded copper to the value of L700,000. Miners  were brought from England, and a town of about 5,000 inhabitants  rapidly sprang into existence. The houses of the Cornish miners were of  a peculiar kind. A creek runs through the district, with high  precipitous banks of solid rock; into the face of these cliffs the  miners cut large chambers to serve for dwellings; holes bored through  the rock, and emerging upon the surface of the ground above, formed the  chimneys, which were capped by small beer barrels instead of  chimney-pots. The fronts of the houses were of weatherboard, in which  doors were left; and for two miles along each side of the stream these  primitive dwellings looked out upon the almost dry bed of the creek,  which formed the main street of the village. Here the miners dwelt for  years, until the waters rose one night into a foaming flood, which  destroyed the houses and swept away several of their inhabitants.    In 1845 Burra Burra was a lonely moor; in 1850 it was bustling with men,  and noisy with the sounds of engines, pumps and forges. Acres of land  were covered with the company's warehouses and offices, and the handsome  residences of its officers; behind these there rose great mounds of  blue, green, and dark-red ores of copper, worth enormous sums of money.  Along the roads eight hundred teams, each consisting of eight bullocks,  passed constantly to and fro, whilst scores of ships were employed in  conveying the ore to England. From this great activity the "]]]
