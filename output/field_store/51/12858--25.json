They dined long and late, and with much old-world  pomp and ceremonial. They drove out in coaches emblazoned with heraldic  bearings, and attended by broad-calved flunkeys in family livery.  Certain social observances of the early Georgian era, long since effete  and worn out in England, flourished in the social life of Little York  down to a period within the memory of many persons who are still living.  The aristocratic clique which preserved these customs was in the highest  degree rigid and exclusive. No outsider was admitted into the charmed  circle unless he came duly ticketed and accredited. The attempt to  transplant the usages of an old and advanced state of society into the  primitive streets and lanes of such places as York, Kingston, and  Woodstock was for a time more successful than might be supposed. Such of  the families as had been to the manner born carried off these  observances with considerable grace. They had brought their traditions  with them across the Atlantic, and though such traditions were not well  suited to the genius of a young and sparsely-settled colony, they were  at least maintained with some regard to the sources whence they had been  derived. With the pretenders who formed a portion of the clique, and who  had been admitted into it for special political reasons, the attempt to  copy the habits of their social superiors was, generally speaking, less  satisfactory. There was, in truth, an inner social circle which these  latter were never invited to join. They, however, enjoyed all the  political and pecuniary advantages arising from their connection, and  were not easily distinguishable by outsiders from the very head and  front of the organization.    So far as to the wealthy members of the ruling faction. But there were a  good many of them who not only were not wealthy, but who were in  positively indigent circumstances. These, for the most part, were  members of old country families who had sent them to Canada with the  sole object of getting rid of them. Others were half-pay officers who  had spent their whole fortunes in settling on land, after which they had  found themselves unable to make a livelihood, and had then sold their  property for as much--or as little--as they could manage to get. These  latter, after having disposed of their lands, generally repaired to the  towns, and most of them sooner or later found their way to the  Provincial capital. There they became obedient slaves of those in  authority, and picked up a precarious livelihood by making themselves  useful in various ways. The Executive could always find a certain amount  of work for such persons, though, if the truth must be told, the supply  was often greater than the demand. The code of social ethics in vogue  among this class was such as might have been expected from persons who  had been reared to regard themselves as the objects of a special  dispensation of fortune. They looked upon manual labour as degrading.  Any person, no matter what his abilities, who earned a livelihood by the  sweat of his brow, or even by honest trade, was considered as no fit  company for the brood of parasites who hung on to the heels of the  Compact, and who nevertheless did not hesitate to perform tasks from  which the average costermonger would have shrunk in disgust. Their  employers occasionally admitted them to their tables, and even to some  degree of social intimacy. More frequently they presented them with  their cast-off clothing, with new gowns for their wives at Christmas,  or--when things were at a remarkably low ebb--with a hundredweight of  flour or half a barrel of mess pork. Yet the recipients of these favours  piqued themselves upon their good birth and high connexions, and would  have felt themselves insulted if anyone had ventured to hint that they  should visit, upon terms of equality, with the grocer or the butcher in  the next street.    The reader now has before him a sufficient array of facts to enable him  to form a pretty accurate conception of the state of social life in  Upper Canada during ante-Rebellion times. It was a matter of course that  such a monopoly of power as was possessed and exercised by the ruling  faction should excite envy and opposition on the part of those who did  not revel in its smiles or share in its plunder. Loud murmurings began  to make themselves heard against the delay and partiality in the  land-granting department, and against the corrupt manner in which the  public affairs of the Province generally were carried on. Before the  close of Governor Hunter's _regime_ these murmurings had become loud  enough to occasion no little disquiet to some of the officials who had  most reason to dread enquiry and investigation. The abuses were greater  in some branches of the service than in others, but peculation prevailed  to a greater or less extent almost everywhere. The Indian department was  notorious for the corruption of its officials. A sum of sixty thousand  pounds sterling was annually granted by the Imperial Government for  distribution among the various tribes, and for the payment of agents and  interpreters. The distribution among the Indians chiefly took the form  of commodities which had a particular fascination for the mind of the  noble savage--such commodities, for instance, as muskets, powder,  bullets, knives, tomahawks, hatchets, blankets, spangles, pocket  mirrors, and--last, but by no means least--fire-water. The opportunities  which this grant afforded for peculation and plunder were too tempting  to be resisted. The agents and their subordinates, from highest to  lowest, owed their positions to their servility and usefulness to those  in authority. So long as they proved serviceable and obedient to their  masters, there was not much likelihood of their being called to serious  account for any iniquities they might commit towards Mohawk or Seneca,  Oneida or Mississauga. By way of consequence, the Indians were robbed and  the Government was robbed; and the robbers, feeling secure of protection  from their superiors, plied their nefarious traffic with impunity.[51]  There were equally culpable but less notorious abuses of power in other  branches of the service. Probably not one in ten of these ever came to  light, but from time to time there were awkward revelations which could  not be suppressed. All these things combined to beget a widespread lack  of confidence in the official clique. The want of confidence, not  without good reason, extended even to the administrators of the law. The  judges, as already mentioned, held office at the will of the Executive,  and, at least in some instances, were shamelessly servile and corrupt.  This led to their dicta being disregarded by sturdy juries who cared  less for the letter of the law than for its spirit. Mr. John Mills  Jackson, in his \"View of the Political Situation of the Province of  Upper Canada,\" published in 1809, speaks of an instance where the people  became tumultuous, and broke the public stocks in the presence of the  Chief Justice.[52] The public distrust of the administrators of the law  does not seem to have been confined to the judges of the Superior  Courts. It extended to the rural magistrates, some of whom turned their  offices to commodity in a manner which would have excited the admiration  of Falstaff himself. \"The shop-keepers,\" writes Mr. Jackson, \"are  Justices of Peace. They have the means of extortion, and the power of  enforcing payments. They are first the criminals, then the judges; and  the court of appeal seems to be so constructed as to prevent an honest  verdict from passing into effect. The practice of the court is unjust,  oppressive, and influenced. Favourite attorneys were made deputy clerks  of the peace, so that process might be entered and writs obtained most  partially. The crown lawyer is allowed nearly seven pounds sterling for  every criminal prosecution! an inducement to listen to trifling  complaints, and prefer frivolous indictments, when, if power was  gratified and independence harassed, it was a sufficient excuse for an  inflated contingent account.\" The author of this scathing philippic  against petty oppression proceeds to recount a case wherein an action  was brought against a magistrate who had exerted his authority in an  illegal and oppressive manner. A verdict was obtained against him for a  hundred pounds. An application was made to the Court of King's Bench to  set the verdict aside, which was rejected; whereupon the clerk of the  court in which the judgment had been obtained was ordered by the Crown  lawyer not to issue execution. The clerk knew better than to disobey an  order from such a source, and the plaintiff accordingly took nothing by  his verdict. The unrighteous magistrate escaped the penalty of his  misdeeds, and furnished a sort of standing precedent for magisterial  iniquity. Other equally flagrant perversions of justice are recorded by  the same authority. An illegal and unjustifiable extent issued, at the  suit of the Crown, against one of the civil officers. It lasted for  years; yet the officer dared not resist oppression by applying for  justice. \"When [the extent] was as imperiously taken off as it was  arbitrarily laid on,\" writes Mr. Jackson, \"the sheriff dared not apply  for fees expended in holding possession under the writ, or the printer  sue for the money voted him by the House of Assembly for printing their  journals. The surveyors could not obtain the money they had actually  expended in the public service, nor the people find redress for extorted  fees. Therefore, when there was neither substance nor shadow of law or  justice, but the will of power was the rule of decision, the public mind  was agitated in the extreme, and universal gloom pervaded the Province.\"    The discontent produced by official tyranny was however almost impotent  as against"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#19)"],[1,"propensities which could not be  resisted. But, at the same time, there were to be \"hospitals\" in which  not only the physically diseased, but also the mentally and _morally_  diseased, were to be detained until they were cured; and when we reflect  that the laws of the parallelogram were very stringent and minute, and  required to be absolutely enforced to the letter, otherwise the whole  machinery of society would come to pieces, like a watch with a broken  spring,--it is clear that these hospitals would have contained a very  large proportion of the unrationalised population.    There is rather an alarming amount of this sort of communism now among  us, and it is therefore with some little misgiving that one sets down  anything that may betray a brother's weakness, and lay bare the  diagnosis of a human frailty. Indeed, the bad name that proverbially  hangs the dog has already been given to the one under consideration, for  bibliomania is older in the technology of this kind of nosology than  dipsomania, which is now understood to be an almost established ground  for seclusion, and deprivation of the management of one's own affairs.  There is one ground of consolation, however,--the people who, being all  right themselves, have undertaken the duty of keeping in order the rest  of the world, have far too serious a task in hand to afford time for  idle reading. There is a good chance, therefore, that this little book  may pass them unnoticed, and the harmless class, on whose peculiar  frailties the present occasion is taken for devoting a gentle and kindly  exposition, may yet be permitted to go at large.    So having spoken, I now propose to make the reader acquainted with some  characteristic specimens of the class.          A Vision of Mighty Book-Hunters.      As the first case, let us summon from the shades my venerable friend  Archdeacon Meadow, as he was in the body. You see him now--tall,  straight, and meagre, but with a grim dignity in his air which warms  into benignity as he inspects a pretty little clean Elzevir, or a tall  portly Stephens, concluding his inward estimate of the prize with a  peculiar grunting chuckle, known by the initiated to be an important  announcement. This is no doubt one of the milder and more inoffensive  types, but still a thoroughly confirmed and obstinate case. Its parallel  to the classes who are to be taken charge of by their wiser neighbours  is only too close and awful; for have not sometimes the female members  of his household been known on occasion of some domestic emergency--or,  it may be, for mere sake of keeping the lost man out of mischief--to  have been searching for him on from bookstall unto bookstall, just as  the mothers, wives, and daughters of other lost men hunt them through  their favourite taverns or gambling-houses? Then, again, can one forget  that occasion of his going to London to be examined by a committee of  the House of Commons, when he suddenly disappeared with all his money in  his pocket, and returned penniless, followed by a waggon containing 372  copies of rare editions of the Bible? All were fish that came to his  net. At one time you might find him securing a minnow for sixpence at a  stall--and presently afterwards he outbids some princely collector, and  secures with frantic impetuosity, \"at any price,\" a great fish he has  been patiently watching year after year. His hunting-grounds were wide  and distant, and there were mysterious rumours about the numbers of  copies, all identically the same in edition and minor individualities,  which he possessed of certain books. I have known him, indeed, when  beaten at an auction, turn round resignedly and say, \"Well, so be  it--but I daresay I have ten or twelve copies at home, if I could lay  hands on them.\"    It is a matter of extreme anxiety to his friends, and, if he have a  well-constituted mind, of sad misgiving to himself, when the collector  buys his first _duplicate_. It is like the first secret dram swallowed  in the forenoon--the first pawning of the silver spoons--or any other  terrible first step downwards you may please to liken it to. There is no  hope for the patient after this. It rends at once the veil of decorum  spun out of the flimsy sophisms by which he has been deceiving his  friends, and partially deceiving himself, into the belief that his  previous purchases were necessary, or, at all events, serviceable for  professional and literary purposes. He now becomes shameless and  hardened; and it is observable in the career of this class of  unfortunates, that the first act of duplicity is immediately followed by  an access of the disorder, and a reckless abandonment to its  propensities. The Archdeacon had long passed this stage ere he crossed  my path, and had become thoroughly hardened. He was not remarkable for  local attachment; and in moving from place to place, his spoil, packed  in innumerable great boxes, sometimes followed him, to remain unreleased  during the whole period of his tarrying in his new abode, so that they  were removed to the next stage of his journey through life with modified  inconvenience.    Cruel as it may seem, I must yet notice another and a peculiar vagary of  his malady. He had resolved, at least once in his life, to part with a  considerable proportion of his collection--better to suffer the anguish  of such an act than endure the fretting of continued restraint. There  was a wondrous sale by auction accordingly; it was something like what  may have occurred on the dissolution of the monasteries at the  Reformation, or when the contents of some time-honoured public library  were realised at the period of the French Revolution. Before the affair  was over, the Archdeacon himself made his appearance in the midst of the  miscellaneous self-invited guests who were making free with his  treasures,--he pretended, honest man, to be a mere casual spectator,  who, having seen, in passing, the announcement of a sale by auction,  stepped in like the rest of the public. By degrees he got excited,  gasped once or twice as if mastering some desperate impulse, and at  length fairly bade. He could not brazen out the effect of this escapade,  however, and disappeared from the scene. It was remarked by the  observant, that an unusual number of lots were afterwards knocked down  to a military gentleman, who seemed to have left portentously large  orders with the auctioneer. Some curious suspicions began to arise,  which were settled by that presiding genius bending over his rostrum,  and explaining in a confidential whisper that the military hero was in  reality a pillar of the Church so disguised.    The Archdeacon lay under what, among a portion of the victims of his  malady, was deemed a heavy scandal. He was suspected of reading his own  books--that is to say, when he could get at them; for there are those  who may still remember his rather shamefaced apparition of an evening,  petitioning, somewhat in the tone with which an old schoolfellow down in  the world requests your assistance to help him to go to York to get an  appointment--petitioning for the loan of a volume of which he could not  deny that he possessed numberless copies lurking in divers parts of his  vast collection. This reputation of reading the books in his collection,  which should be sacred to external inspection solely, is, with a certain  school of book-collectors, a scandal, such as it would be among a  hunting set to hint that a man had killed a fox. In the dialogues, not  always the most entertaining, of Dibdin's Bibliomania, there is this  short passage: \"'I will frankly confess,' rejoined Lysander, 'that I am  an arrant _bibliomaniac_--that I love books dearly--that the very sight,  touch, and mere perusal----' 'Hold, my friend,' again exclaimed  Philemon; 'you have renounced your profession--you talk of _reading_  books--do _bibliomaniacs_ ever _read_ books?'\"    Yes, the Archdeacon read books--he devoured them; and he did so to full  prolific purpose. His was a mind enriched with varied learning, which he  gave forth with full, strong, easy flow, like an inexhaustible perennial  spring coming from inner reservoirs, never dry, yet too capacious to  exhibit the brawling, bubbling symptoms of repletion. It was from a  majestic heedlessness of the busy world and its fame that he got the  character of indolence, and was set down as one who would leave no  lasting memorial of his great learning. But when he died, it was not  altogether without leaving a sign; for from the casual droppings of his  pen has been preserved enough to signify to many generations of students  in the walk he chiefly affected how richly his mind was stored, and how  much fresh matter there is in those fields of inquiry where compilers  have left their dreary tracks, for ardent students to cultivate into a  rich harvest. In him truly the bibliomania may be counted among the many  illustrations of the truth so often moralised on, that the highest  natures are not exempt from human frailty in some shape or other.    Let us now summon the shade of another departed victim--Fitzpatrick  Smart, Esq. He, too, through a long life, had been a vigilant and  enthusiastic collector, but after a totally different fashion. He was  far from omnivorous. He had a principle of selection peculiar and  separate from all other's, as was his own individuality from other  men's. You could not classify his library according to any of the  accepted nomenclatures peculiar to the initiated. He was not a  black-letter man, or a tall copyist, or an uncut man, or a rough-edge  man, or an early-English-dramatist, or an Elzevirian, or a broadsider,  or a pasquinader, or an old-brown-calf man, or a Grangerite, or a  tawny-moroccoite, or a gilt-topper, a marbled-insider, or an _editio  princeps_ man; neither did he come under any of the more vulgar  classifications of collectors whose thoughts run more upon the  usefulness for"]]]
