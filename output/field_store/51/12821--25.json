In the month before their  arrival, Endicot, in a letter [May 11, 1629] to Bradford thanking him  for the visit of Fuller, had said: 'I rejoice much that I am by him  satisfied touching your judgments of the outward form of God's  worship.'--Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, First  Series, Vol. III., p. 65.]    [Footnote 32: Cotton Mather relates that, taking the last look at his  native shore, Higginson said, 'We will not say, as the Separatists say,  \"Farewell, Babylon; farewell, Rome;\" but we will say, \"Farewell, dear  England; farewell, Church of God in England, and all the Christian  friends there. We do not go to New England as separatists from the  Church of England, though we cannot but separate from the corruptions of  it. But we go to practise the positive part of Church reformation, and  propagate the gospel in America.'\"--Magnalia, Book III., Part II., Chap.  i., quoted by Palfrey, Vol. I., p. 297, in a note.    \"They were careful to distinguish themselves from the Brownist and other  Separatists. Had they remained in England, and the Church been governed  with the wisdom and moderation of the present day, they would have  remained, to use their own expression, 'in the bosom of the Church where  they had received their hopes of salvation.'\"--Hutchinson's History of  Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., p. 417.    Note by Mr. Hutchinson: \"The son of one of the first ministers, in a  preface to a sermon preached soon after the Revolution, remarks that 'if  the bishops in the reign of King Charles the First had been of the same  spirit as those in the reign of King William, there would have been no  New England.'\"]    [Footnote 33: History of Massachusetts Bay, Vol. I., Chap, iv., p. 418.]    [Footnote 34: \"The Messrs. Brown went out with the second emigration, at  the same time as Messrs. Higginson and Skelton, a few months after  Endicot, and while he was the local Governor, several months before the  arrival of the third emigration of eleven ships with Governor Winthrop.  In the Company's first letter of instructions to Endicot, dated the 17th  of April, 1629, they speak of and commend the Messrs. Brown in the  following terms:    \"'Through many businesses we had almost forgot to recommend to you two  brethren of our Company, Mr. John and Mr. Samuel Brown, who though they  be no adventurers in the general stock, yet are they men we do much  respect, being fully persuaded of their sincere affections to the good  of our Plantation. The one, Mr. John Brown, is sworn assistant here, and  by us chosen one of the Council there; a man experienced in the laws of  our kingdom, and such an one as we are persuaded will worthily deserve  your favour and furthermore, which we desire he may have, and that in  the first division of lands there may be allotted to either of them two  hundred acres.'\" (Young's Chronicles of the First Planters of the Colony  of Massachusetts Bay, from 1623 to 1636, p. 168.)]    [Footnote 35: History of New England, Vol. I., p. 298.]    [Footnote 36: Bancroft's History of the United States, Vol. I., p. 379.]    [Footnote 37: History of the United States, Am. Ed. 8vo, Vol. I., p.  350. These three sentences are not found in the British Museum (English)  Edition of Mr. Bancroft's History, but are contained in Routledge's  London reprint of the American Edition.]    [Footnote 38: \"Ecclesiastical History of Massachusetts,\" in the  Collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol. IX., pp. 3-5.]    [Footnote 39: It is clear, from these and other corresponding  statements, that the Messrs. Brown had had no controversy with Endicot;  had not in the least interfered with _his_ proceedings, but had quietly  and inoffensively pursued their own course in adhering to the old  worship; and only stated their objections to his proceedings by giving  the reasons for their own, when arraigned before his tribunal to answer  for their not coming to his worship, and continuing in that of their own  Church. The reasonings and speeches thus drawn from them were deemed  \"seditious and mutinous,\" and for which they were adjudged \"criminals'\"  and banished. Looking at all the facts of the case--including the want  of good faith to the Browns and those who agreed with them--it exceeds  in inquisitorial and despotic prescriptive persecution that which drove  the Brownists from England to Holland in the first years of James the  First.]    [Footnote 40: Collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society.    Mr. F.M. Hubbard, in his new edition of Belknap's American Biography,  iii. 166, referring to Endicot, says: \"He was of a quick temper, which  the habit of military command had not softened; of strong religious  feelings, moulded on the sternest features of Calvinism; resolute to  uphold with the sword what he had received as gospel truth, and fearing  no enemy so much as a gainsaying spirit. Cordially disliking the English  Church, he banished the Browns and the Prayer Book; and averse to all  ceremonies and symbols, the cross on the King's colours was an  abomination he could not away with. He cut down the Maypole on Merry  Mount, published his detestation of long hair in a formal proclamation,  and set in the pillory and on the gallows the returning Quakers.\"]    [Footnote 41: The words of the Company's letter are as follows:    \"And for that the propagating of the Gospel is the thing we do profess  above all to be our aim in settling this Plantation, we have been  careful to make plentiful provision of godly ministers, by whose  faithful preaching, godly conversation, and exemplary life, we trust not  only those of our own nation will be built up in the knowledge of God,  but also the Indians may, in God's appointed time, be reduced to the  obedience of the Gospel of Christ. One of them, viz., Mr. Skelton, whom  we have rather desired to bear a part in this work, for that we have  been informed yourself formerly received much good by his ministry.  Another is Mr. Higgeson (Higginson), a grave man, and of worthy  commendations. The third is Mr. Bright, sometimes trained up under Mr.  Davenport. We pray you, accommodate them all with necessaries as well as  you may, and in convenient time let there be houses built for them,  according to the agreement we have made with them, copies whereof, as of  all others we have entertained, shall be sent you by the next ships,  time not permitting now. We doubt not these gentlemen, your ministers,  will agree lovingly together; and for cherishing of love betwixt them,  we pray you carry yourself impartially to all. For the manner of  exercising their ministry, and teaching both our own people and the  Indians, we leave that to themselves, hoping they will make God's Word  the rule of their actions, and mutually agree in the discharge of their  duties.    \"We have, in prosecution of that good opinion we have always had of you,  confirmed you Governor of our Plantation, and joined in commission with  you the three ministers--namely, Mr. Francis Higginson, Mr. Samuel  Skelton, and Mr. Francis Bright; also Mr. John and Samuel Brown, Mr.  Thomas Groves, and Mr. Samuel Sharpe.\"--The Company's First General  Letter of Instructions to Endicot and his Council, the 17th of April,  1629.

Why do thy thunders frighten me and pain?      Why am I seized upon by hands of rain?                       28    O Indra, mighty Indra!        Did I then give thee of my love before,      That now thy clouds like mighty lions roar?      Ah no! Thou shouldst not send thy streaming rain,      To fill my journey to my love with pain.                     29    [83.23. S.

She is your  friend,        This golden cord that trembles on the breast      Of great Airavata;[67] upon the crest        Of rocky hills this banner all ablaze;      This lamp in Indra's palace; but most blest        As telling where your most beloved stays.                  33    _Vasantasena._ And here, sir, is his house.    _Courtier._ You know all the arts, and need no instruction now.  Yet love bids me prattle. When you enter here, you must not  show yourself too angry.        Where anger is, there love is not;      Or no! except for anger hot,        There is no love.        Be angry! make him angry then!      Be kind! and make him kind again--        The man you love.                                          34    So much for that. Who is there? Let Charudatta know, that    P. 145.17]        While clouds look beautiful, and in the hour      Fragrant with nipa and kadamba flower,      She comes to see her lover, very wet.      With dripping locks, but pleased and loving yet.      Though lightning and though thunder terrifies,      She comes to see you; 't is for you she sighs.      The mud still soils the anklets on her feet,      But in a moment she will have them sweet.                    35    _Charudatta._ [_Listening._] My friend, pray discover what this means.    _Maitreya._ Yes, sir. [_He approaches Vasantasena. Respectfully._]  Heaven bless you!    _Vasantasena._ I salute you, sir. I am very glad to see you. [_To the  courtier._] Sir, the maid with the umbrella is at your service.    _Courtier._ [_Aside._] A very clever way to get rid of me. [_Aloud._]  Thank you. And mistress Vasantasena,        Pride and tricks and lies and fraud        Are in your face;      False playground of the lustful god,        Such is your face;      The wench's stock in trade, in fine,      Epitome of joys divine,        I mean, your face--      For sale! the price is courtesy.      I trust you'll find a man to buy        Your face.                                    [_Exit._]    36    _Vasantasena._ Good Maitreya, where is your gambler?    _Maitreya._ [_Aside._] \"Gambler\"? Ah, she's paying a compliment to  my friend. [_Aloud._] Madam, here he is in the dry orchard.    _Vasantasena._ But sir, what do you call a dry orchard?    _Maitreya._ Madam, it's a place where there's nothing to eat or  drink, [_Vasantasena smiles._] Pray enter, madam.    _Vasantasena._ [_Aside to her maid._] What shall I say when I enter?    [87.17. S.    _Maid._ \"Gambler, what luck this evening?\"    _Vasantasena._ Shall I dare to say it?    _Maid._ When the time comes, it will say itself.    _Maitreya._ Enter, madam.    _Vasantasena._ [_Enters, approaches Charudatta, and strikes him with  the flowers which she holds._] Well, gambler, what luck this evening?    _Charudatta._ [_Discovers her._] Ah, Vasantasena is here. [_He rises  joyfully._] Oh, my beloved,        My evenings pass in watching ever,        My nights from sighs are never free;      This evening cannot else than sever--        In bringing you--my grief and me.                          37    You are very, very welcome. Here is a seat. Pray be seated.    _Maitreya._ Here is a seat. Be seated, madam. [_Vasantasena sits, then  the others._]    _Charudatta._ But see, my friend,        The dripping flower that decks her ear, droops down,            And one sweet breast      Anointed is, like a prince who wears the crown,            With ointment blest.                                   38    My friend, Vasantasena's garments are wet. Let other, and most  beautiful, garments be brought.    _Maitreya._ Yes, sir.    _Maid._ Good Maitreya, do you stay here. I will wait upon my mistress.  [_She does so._]    _Maitreya._ [_Aside to Charudatta._] My friend, I'd just like to ask  the lady a question.    _Charudatta._ Then do so.    _Maitreya._ [_Aloud._] Madam, what made you come here, when it  is so stormy and dark that you can't see the moon?    _Maid._ Mistress, the Brahman is very plain-spoken.    P. 148.17]    _Vasantasena._ You might better call him clever.    _Maid._ My mistress came to ask how much that pearl necklace is  worth.    _Maitreya._ [_Aside to Charudatta._] There! I told you so. She thinks  the pearl necklace is cheap, and the golden casket is expensive.  She isn't satisfied. She has come to look for something more.    _Maid._ For my mistress imagined that it was her own, and gambled  it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master has gone,  for he is employed in the king's business.    _Maitreya._ Madam, you are simply repeating what somebody said  before.    _Maid._ While we are looking for him, pray take this golden casket.  [_She displays the casket._ _Maitreya hesitates._] Sir, you examine  it very closely. Did you ever see it before?    _Maitreya._ No, madam, but the skilful workmanship captivates  the eye.    _Maid._ Your eyes deceive you, sir. This _is_ the golden casket.    _Maitreya._ [_Joyfully._] Well, my friend, here is the golden casket,  the very one that thieves stole from our house.    _Charudatta._ My friend,        The artifice we tried before,      Her stolen treasure to restore,      Is practised now on us. But no,      I cannot think 't is really so.                              39    _Maitreya._ But it is so. I swear it on my Brahmanhood.    _Charudatta._ This is welcome news.    _Maitreya._ [_Aside to Charudatta._] I'm going to ask where they  found it.    _Charudatta._ I see no harm in that.    _Maitreya._ [_Whispers in the maid's ear._] There!    _Maid._ [_Whispers in Maitreya's ear._] So there!    [89.19. S.    _Charudatta._ What is it? and why are we left out?    _Maitreya._ [_Whispers in Charudatta's ear._] So there!    _Charudatta._ My good girl, is this really the same golden casket?    _Maid._ Yes, sir, the very same.    _Charudatta._ My good girl, I have never let the bearer of welcome  news go unrewarded. Take this ring as your recompense. [_He  looks at his finger, notices that the ring is gone, and betrays his  embarrassment._]    _Vasantasena._ [_To herself._] I love you for that.    _Charudatta._ [_Aside to Maitreya._] Alas,        When in this world a man has lost his all,        Why should he set his heart on longer life?      His angers and his favors fruitless fall,        His purposes and powers are all at strife.                 40        Like wingless birds, dry pools, or withered trees,      Like fangless snakes--the poor are like to these.            41        Like man-deserted houses, blasted trees,      Like empty wells--the poor are like to these.      For them no pleasant hours serve happy ends;      They are forgotten of their sometime friends.                42    _Maitreya._ But you must not grieve thus beyond reason. [_He  bursts out laughing. Aloud._] Madam, please give me back my  bath-clout.    _Vasantasena._ Charudatta, it was not right that you should show  your distrust of me by sending me this pearl necklace.    _Charudatta._ [_With an embarrassed smile._] But remember, Vasantasena,        Who will believe the truth?        Suspicion now is sure.      This world will show no ruth        To the inglorious poor.                                    43    P. 152.4]    _Maitreya._ Tell me, girl, are you going to sleep here to-night?    _Maid._ [_Laughing._] But good Maitreya, you show yourself most  remarkably plain-spoken now.    _Maitreya._ See, my friend, the rain enters again in great streams,  as if it wanted to drive people away when they are sitting comfortably  together.    _Charudatta._ You are quite right.        The falling waters pierce the cloud,        As lotus-shoots the soil;      And tears the face of heaven shroud,        Who weeps the moon's vain toil.                            44    And again:        In streams as pure as thoughts to good men given,        But merciless as darts that Arjun hurls,      And black as Baladeva's cloak, the heaven        Seems to pour out all Indra's hoarded pearls.              45    See, my beloved, see!        The heaven is painted with the blackest dye,        And fanned by cool and fragrant evening airs;      Red lightning, glad in union, clasps the sky      With voluntary arms, and shows on high        The love that maiden heart to lover bears.                 46    [_Vasantasena betrays her passion, and throws her arms about Charudatta.  Charudatta feels her touch, and embraces her._]    _Charudatta._        More grimly yet, O thunder, boom;        For by thy grace and power      My love-distracted limbs now bloom        Like the kadamba flower.      Her dear touch all my being thrills,      And love my inmost spirit fills.                             47    _Maitreya._ Confound you, storm! You are no gentleman, to  frighten the lady with the lightning.    [91.20. S.    _Charudatta._          Do not rebuke the storm, my friend.
