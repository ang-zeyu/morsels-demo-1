The pines, moreover, take no deep root; and, as  soon as the underbrush or thicket is cleared, they fall before the  storm. Provident settlers, therefore, rarely leave large and lofty trees  near their dwellings for fear of accident.    The pine, in the Penetanguishene country, has a strange fancy to start  out of the earth in three, five, or more trunks, all joined at the base,  and each trunk an enormous tree. I have an idea that this has arisen  from the stony, loose soil they grow in, which has caused this strange  freak of Nature, by making it difficult for the young plant to rear its  head out of the ground. Whatever is the reason, however, all the masts  of some \"great Amiral\" might be truly provided out of a single  pine-tree.    But we must leave Barrie, after just mentioning Kempenfeldt, about a  mile or so distant, which was the original village; and, although at the  actual terminus of the land road, has never flourished, and still  consists of some half dozen houses. The newer Admiral superseded the  more ancient one; for Barrie did deeds of renown, which it suited the  Canadians to commemorate much more than the unfortunate Kempenfeldt and  his melancholy end.    If ever there was an infamous road between two villages so close  together, it is the road between these two places; I hope it will be  mended, for it is both dark and dangerous.    I always wondered not a little how it happened that Bingham of Barrie  kept such a good table, where fresh meat was as plentiful as at Toronto.  I looked for the market-place of the capital of Simcoe: there was none.  But the mystery was solved the moment I put my foot on board the Beaver  steamer to go back by the water road.    What will the reader think of Leadenhall Market being condensed and  floating? Such, however, was the case; there was a regular travelling  butcher's-shop, for the supply of the settlers around Lake Simcoe; and  meat, clean and enticing as at the finest stall in the market aforesaid,  where upon regular hooks were regularly displayed the fine roasting and  boiling joints of the season. And a very fair speculation no doubt it  is, this pedlar butchery.    On the 3rd of July, at half-past twelve, I left the capital of the  Simcoe district, and am particular as to dates and seasons, because it  tells the traveller for pleasure what are the times and the tides he  should choose.    We embarked on board the good ship Beaver, a large steam-vessel, for the  Holland Landing, distant twenty-eight miles--twenty-one of them by the  lake, and seven by the river. The vessel stops by the way at several  settlements, where half-pay officers generally have pitched their tents;  and twice a week she makes the grand tour of the whole lake, at an  altitude of upwards of seven hundred and fifty feet above Lake Ontario,  and not forty miles from it.    This navigation of the Holland river is very well worth seeing, as it is  a natural canal flowing through a vast marsh, and very narrow, with most  serpentine convolutions, often doubling upon itself.--Conceive the  difficulty of steering a large steamboat in such a course; yet it is  done every day in summer and autumn, by means of long poles, slackening  the steam, backing, &c., though very rarely without running a little way  into the soft mud of the swamp. The motion of the paddles has, however,  in the course of years, widened the channel and prevented the growth of  flags and weeds.    There is one place called the Devil's Elbow, a common name in Canada for  a difficult river pass, where the sluggish water fairly makes a double,  and great care is necessary. Here the enterprising owner and master of  the vessel tried to cut a channel; but, after getting a straight course  through the mud for two-thirds of the way, he found it too expensive to  proceed, but declares that he will persevere. Why does not the Board of  Works, which has literally the expenditure of more than a million, take  the business in hand, and complete it? One or two hundred pounds would  finish the affair. But perhaps it is too trifling, and, like the cut at  the Long Point, Lake Erie, to which we shall come presently, is  overlooked in the magnitude of greater things.    Of all the unformed, unfinished public establishments in Canada, it has  always appeared to me that the Crown Lands department, and the Board of  Works, are pre-eminent. One costs more to manage the funds it raises  than the funds amount to; and the other was for several years a mere  political job. No very eminent civil engineer could have afforded to  devote his time and talents to it, as he must have been constantly  exposed to be turned out of office by caprice or cupidity. I do not  know how it is now managed, but the political jobbing is, I believe, at  an end, as the same person presides over the office who held it when it  was in very bad odour. This gentleman must, however, be quite adequate  to the office, as some of the public works are magnificent; but I cannot  go so far as to say that one must approve of all. The St. Lawrence Canal  has cost the best part of a million, is useless in time of war, and a  mere foil at all times to the Rideau navigation, which the British  government constructed free of any provincial funds. The timber slides  on the Trent are so much money put into the timber-merchants' pockets,  to the extreme detriment of the neighbouring settlers, whose lands have  been swept of every available stick by the lawless hordes of woodcutters  engaged to furnish this work; and who, living in the forest, were beyond  the reach of justice or of reason, destroying more trees than they could  carry away, and defying, gun and axe in hand, the peaceable  proprietors.    It was intended, before the rebellion broke out, to render the river  Trent navigable by a splendid canal, which would have opened the finest  lands in Canada for hundreds of miles, and eventually to have connected  Lake Huron with Lake Ontario. A large sum of money was expended on it  before the Board of Works was constituted, and an experienced clerk of  works, fresh from the Rideau Canal, was chosen to superintend; but the  troubles commenced, and the money was wanted elsewhere.    When money became again plentiful, and the country so loudly demanded  the Trent Canal, why was it not finished? I shall give by and by an  account of a recent excursion to the Trent, and then we shall perhaps  learn more about it, and why perishing timber slides were substituted  for a magnificent canal.    But the Devil's Elbow should be straightened by the Board of Works at  all events, otherwise it may stick in the mud, and then nobody can help  it; for the marsh is very extensive, and there would be no Jupiter to  cry out to.    Well, however, in spite of all obstacles, Captain Laughton piloted us  safe to Ague and Fever Landing, where, depend upon it, we did not stay a  moment longer than sufficed to jump into a coloured gentleman's waggon,  which was in waiting, and in which we were driven off as a coloured  gentleman always drives, that is to say, in a hand-gallop, to Winch's  tavern, our old accustomed inn at St. Alban's, where we arrived in due  time, and there hired another Jehu, who was an American Irishman (a sad  compound), to take us as far towards Yonge Street as practicable. We  reached Richmond Hill, seventeen miles from the Landing, at about eight  o'clock, having made a better day's journey than is usually accomplished  on a road which will be macadamized some fine day; for the Board of  Works have a Polish engineer hard at work surveying it--of course no  Canadian was to be found equal to this intricate piece of  engineering--and I saw a variety of sticks stuck up, but what they meant  I cannot guess at. I suppose they were going to _grade_ it, which is the  favourite American term--a term, by the by, by no manner or method  meaning gradus ad Parnassum, or even laying it out in steps and stairs,  like the Scotch military road near Loch Ness; but which, as far as my  limited information in Webster's Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon tongue  goes, signifies levelling. I may, however, be mistaken; and this puts me  in mind of another tale to beguile the way.    A character set out from England to try his fortune in Canada. He was  conversing about prospects in that country, on board the vessel, with a  person who knew him, but whom he knew not. \"I have not quite made up my  mind,\" said the character, \"as to what pursuit I shall follow in Canada;  but that which brings most grist to the mill will answer best; and I  hear a man may turn his hand to anything there, without the folly of an  apprenticeship being necessary; for, if he has only brains, bread will  come--now, what do you think would be the best business for my market?\"    \"Why,\" said the gentleman, after pondering a little, \"I should advise  you to try civil engineering; for they are getting up a Board of Works  there, and want that branch of industry very much, for they won't take  natives; nothing but foreigners or strangers will go down.\"    \"What is a civil engineer?\" said the character.    \"A man always measuring and calculating,\" responded his adviser, \"and  that will just suit you.\"    \"So it will,\" rejoined Character; and a civil engineer he became  accordingly, and a very good one into the bargain; for he had brains,  and had used a yard measure all his lifetime.    I was told this story by a person of veracity, who heard the  conversation, but it is by no means a wonderful one; for such is the  versatility of talent which the climate of Northern America engenders,  that I knew a leading member of parliament provincial, who was a  preacher, a shopkeeper, a doctor, a lawyer, a banker, a militia colonel,  and who undertook to build a suspension bridge across the cataracted  river Niagara, to connect the United States with Canada for L8,0"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#19)"],[1,"and the Duc de Nemours were coming over here, which I fear is not  true; I wish it was....    There is one thing in your former letter which I must answer, or,  rather, more advert to. You said to me, that if it was not for me, you  would regret Greece very much. Now, I assure you, dearest Uncle, you  ought not to regret it, though there is not a doubt that _Greece_  would be much happier were you there. But I have heard from various  people who have been staying in Greece that they very soon got to like  the Turks much better than the Greeks, who are very untrue, and are  quite banditti-like; then, again, the country, though undoubtedly fine  in parts, is a rocky and barren country, and also you are constantly  exposed to the effects of the Plague, that most dreadful of all evils;  and then, lastly, how very, very far you would be, how cut off from  all those who are dear to you, and how exposed to dangers of all  kinds!    I much grieve that they are quarrelling so much in the French  Chambers.[27] I must now conclude.

I was sure from your constant affection for us that you  would feel much interested in the event of the 24th. It was a moment  of some anxiety, but all passed over very well. Your Aunt is going  on very well, and the little cousin[28] also. He is smaller than his  brother was, but promises to be like him; the features are much the  same, the shape of the forehead and mouth. The elder Prince was  much interested about his _frere_, and anxious to see him; at first,  however, he declared after a long contemplation, \"_pas beau frere!_\"  Now he thinks better of him, but makes a very odd little face when he  sees him. The name of the little one will be Philippe Eugene Ferdinand  Marie Clement Baudouin (Baldwin)--a name of the old Counts of  Flanders--Leopold Georges. My Aunt, who is his godmother, wished  he should be called Philippe in honour of his grandfather, and  as Philippe _le Bon_ was one of the most powerful Princes of this  country, I gave him the name with pleasure. Eugene is her own name,  Ferdinand that of Chartres, Marie of the Queen and also of Princess  Marie, Clement of Princess Clementine; Leopold your Aunt wished, and  George in honour of St George of England and of George IV. Probably I  shall hereafter give to Leopold the title of Duke of Brabant, and to  Philippe that of Count of Flanders, both fine old titles.

He died in 1905.]          [Pageheading: PRESS COMMENTS]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    LAEKEN, _7th April 1837._    MY DEAREST CHILD,--... You have been the subject of all sorts of  newspaper paragraphs; your good and sensible way of looking on these  very creditable productions _will be of use to you_. If the press says  useful things, and makes observations which merit attention, there  is no doubt that sometimes, though God knows very rarely, something  useful may be gleaned from them. But when you see its present state,  when the one side says black and the other white, when the opposite  political characters are treated by their respective antagonists as  rogues, fools, blockheads, wretches, and all the other names in which  the English political dictionary is so _very rich_, one stands like  the ass, between two bundles of hay, considerably embarrassed which  ought to be chosen....          [Pageheading: THE PRINCESS'S ESTABLISHMENT]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    LAEKEN, _11th April 1837._    ... As I believe the visit at Windsor is fixed for the 15th, I hope  this letter will arrive in time. Perhaps the King will speak to you  about the necessity of forming you an establishment.[29]... Your  position, having a Mother with whom you very naturally remain, would  render a _complete_ independent establishment perhaps matter of _real_  inconvenience; still something like that which Charlotte had will  become desirable. My idea, if it meets with your approbation, would  be this: The Duchess of Northumberland would remain your first Lady,  Baroness Lehzen would fill a position similar to that of Mrs Campbell,  who had been Charlotte's governess in her younger days, and the  Dean[30] would step into the position which good Dr Short[31] held.  An Equerry, I do not think--as you will not go out without your  Mother--you would require. On the other hand, it may become matter  of examination if you will perhaps like to have some young ladies  attendants in the style of Lady Catherine Jenkinson;[32] should this  be your wish, it would become necessary to make very good choices,  else perhaps you would derive more trouble than comfort from the  arrangement; _cela va sans dire_, that the choice could only be  made by yourself, and that nobody should be given you _against_ your  wishes. Should the King speak to you on the subject, I would at once  express this my wish if you should approve some such arrangement,  and beg him to let _you choose_. Resist mildly but _positively_ any  nomination of a Gentleman other than the Dean; it is highly probable  that any other would be put about you as a spy, and turn out at all  events a great bore, which is better avoided....    I received a messenger from Coburg. I enclose the letters and also  a packet with fans. Ever, my beloved child, your faithfully attached  Uncle and Friend,    LEOPOLD R.        [Footnote 29: The Princess was to attain her legal majority on      24th May.]        [Footnote 30: George Davys, the Princess Victoria's      instructor, Dean of Chester, and afterwards Bishop of      Peterborough.]        [Footnote 31: Thomas Vowler Short, Rector of St George's,      Bloomsbury, appointed in 1841 Bishop of Sodor and Man.]        [Footnote 32: Lady Catherine Jenkinson, daughter of the Earl      of Liverpool, soon after the Queen's accession married Colonel      Francis Vernon Harcourt.]          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _12th April 1837._    ... What you say about the newspapers is very true and very  flattering. They are indeed a curious compound of truth and untruth. I  am so used to newspaper nonsense and attacks that I do not mind it in  the least....    How happy I am that that beloved Aunt is going on so well and does not  suffer from the cold, as also the _jeune Philippe_. Leopold must  be great fun with his Aunt Marie;[33] does he still say \"_pas beau  frere!_\" or is he more reconciled to his brother? It is very noble in  the Duc de Nemours to have thus given up his _apanage_;[34] I am sorry  there were such difficulties about it. There is no Ministry formed  yet, I see by the papers.

Sir Henry Hardinge's[35] motion was quite  lost, I am happy to say, and don't you think, dearest Uncle, that  it has almost done good, as it proves that the Tories have lost all  chance of getting in? It was a trial of strength, and the Ministry  have triumphed. I have been reading in the papers, what I suppose you  already know, that it is believed that the Lords _will_ pass the Irish  Corporation Bill;[36] and also that Ministers mean to drop for the  present the question about Church Rates,[37] as the Radicals, being  angry with Ministers relative to the Canada business, would not  support them well.
