Green and  bohea teas were sold at the Boston apothecaries' in 1712. For many years  tea was also sold like medicine in England at the apothecaries' and not  at the grocers'.    Many queer mistakes were made through ignorance of its proper use. Many  colonists put the tea into water, boiled it for a time, threw the  liquid away, and ate the tea-leaves. In Salem they did not find the  leaves very attractive, so they put butter and salt on them.    In 1670 a Boston woman was licensed to sell coffee and chocolate, and  soon coffee-houses were established there. Some did not know how to cook  coffee any more than tea, but boiled the whole coffee-beans in water,  ate them, and drank the liquid; and naturally this was not very good  either to eat or drink.    At the time of the Stamp Act, when patriotic Americans threw the tea  into Boston harbor, Americans were just as great tea-drinkers as the  English. Now it is not so. The English drink much more tea than we do;  and the habit of coffee-drinking, first acquired in the Revolution, has  descended from generation to generation, and we now drink more coffee  than tea. This is one of the differences in our daily life caused by the  Revolution.    Many home-grown substitutes were used in Revolutionary times for tea:  ribwort was a favorite one; strawberry and currant leaves, sage,  thorough-wort, and \"Liberty Tea,\" made from the four-leaved loosestrife.  \"Hyperion tea\" was raspberry leaves, and was said by good patriots to be  \"very delicate and most excellent.\"          CHAPTER VIII    FLAX CULTURE AND SPINNING      In recounting the various influences which assisted the Americans to  success in the War for Independence, such as the courage and integrity  of the American generals, the generosity of the American people, the  skill of Americans in marksmanship, their powers of endurance, their  acclimatization, their confidence and faith, etc., we must never forget  to add their independence in their own homes of any outside help to give  them every necessity of life. No farmer or his wife need fear any king  when on every home farm was found food, drink, medicine, fuel, lighting,  clothing, shelter. Home-made was an adjective that might be applied to  nearly every article in the house. Such would not be the case under  similar stress to-day. In the matter of clothing alone we could not now  be independent. Few farmers raise flax to make linen; few women can spin  either wool or flax, or weave cloth; many cannot knit. In early days  every farmer and his sons raised wool and flax; his wife and daughters  spun them into thread and yarn, knit these into stockings and mittens,  or wove them into linen and cloth, and then made them into clothing.  Even in large cities nearly all women spun yarn and thread, all could  knit, and many had hand-looms to weave cloth at home. These home  occupations in the production of clothing have been very happily termed  the \"homespun industries.\"    Nearly every one has seen one of the pretty foot-wheels for spinning  flax thread for linen, which may yet be found in the attics of many of  our farmhouses, as well as in some of our parlors, where, with a bunch  of flax wound around and tied to the spindle, they have within a few  years been placed as a relic of the olden times.    If one of these flax-wheels could speak to-day, it would sing a tale of  the patient industry, of the tiring work of our grandmothers, even when  they were little children, which ought never to be forgotten.    As soon as the colonists had cleared their farms from stones and stumps,  they planted a field, or \"patch\" of flax, and usually one of hemp. The  seed was sown broadcast like grass-seed in May. Flax is a graceful plant  with pretty drooping blue flowers; hemp has but a sad-colored blossom.    Thomas Tusser says in his _Book of Housewifery_:--        \"Good flax and good hemp to have of her own,      In May a good huswife will see it be sown.      And afterwards trim it to serve in a need;      The fimble to spin, the card for her seed.\"    When the flax plants were three or four inches high, they were weeded by  young women or children who had to work barefoot, as the stalks were  very tender. If the land had a growth of thistles, the weeders could  wear three or four pairs of woollen stockings. The children had to step  facing the wind, so if any plants were trodden down the wind would help  to blow them back into place. When the flax was ripe, in the last of  June or in July, it was pulled up by the roots and laid out carefully to  dry for a day or two, and turned several times in the sun; this work was  called pulling and spreading, and was usually done by men and boys. It  then was \"rippled.\" A coarse wooden or heavy iron wire comb with great  teeth, named a ripple-comb, was fastened on a plank; the stalks of flax  were drawn through it with a quick stroke to break off the seed-bolles  or \"bobs,\" which fell on a sheet spread to catch them; these were saved  for seed for the next crop, or for sale.    Rippling was done in the field. The stalks were then tied in bundles  called beats or bates and stacked. They were tied only at the seed end,  and the base of the stalks was spread out forming a tent-shaped stack,  called a stook. When dry, the stalks were watered to rot the leaves and  softer fibres. Hemp was watered without rippling. This was done  preferably in running water, as the rotting flax poisoned fish. Stakes  were set in the water in the form of a square, called a steep-pool, and  the bates of flax or hemp were piled in solidly, each alternate layer at  right angles with the one beneath it. A cover of boards and heavy stones  was piled on top. In four or five days the bates were taken up and the  rotted leaves removed. A slower process was termed dew-retting; an old  author calls it \"a vile and naughty way,\" but it was the way chiefly  employed in America.    When the flax was cleaned, it was once more dried and tied in bundles.  Then came work for strong men, to break it on the ponderous flax-brake,  to separate the fibres and get out from the centre the hard woody \"hexe\"  or \"bun.\" Hemp was also broken.    A flax-brake is an implement which is almost impossible to describe. It  was a heavy log of wood about five feet long, either large enough so the  flat top was about three feet from the ground, or set on heavy logs to  bring it to that height. A portion of the top was cut down leaving a  block at each end, and several long slats were set in lengthwise and  held firm at each end with edges up, by being set into the end blocks.  Then a similar set of slats, put in a heavy frame, was made with the  slats set far enough apart to go into the spaces of the lower slats. The  flax was laid on the lower slats, the frame and upper slats placed on  it, and then pounded down with a heavy wooden mallet weighing many  pounds. Sometimes the upper frame of slats, or knives as they were  called, were hinged to the big under log at one end, and heavily  weighted at the other, and thus the blow was given by the fall of the  weight, not by the force of the farmer's muscle. The tenacity of the  flax can be seen when it would stand this violent beating; and the cruel  blow can be imagined, which the farmer's fingers sometimes got when he  carelessly thrust his hand with the flax too far under the descending  jaw--a shark's maw was equally gentle.    Flax was usually broken twice, once with an \"open-tooth brake,\" once  with a \"close or strait brake,\" that is, one where the long, sharp-edge  strips of wood were set closely together. Then it was scutched or  swingled with a swingling block and knife, to take out any small  particles of bark that might adhere. A man could swingle forty pounds  of flax a day, but it was hard work. All this had to be done in clear  sunny weather when the flax was as dry as tinder.    The clean fibres were then made into bundles called strikes. The strikes  were swingled again, and from the refuse called swingle-tree hurds,  coarse bagging could be spun and woven. After being thoroughly cleaned  the rolls or strikes were sometimes beetled, that is, pounded in a  wooden trough with a great pestle-shaped beetle over and over again  until soft.    Then came the hackling or hetcheling, and the fineness of the flax  depended upon the number of hacklings, the fineness of the various  hackles or hetchels or combs, and the dexterity of the operator. In the  hands of a poor hackler the best of flax would be converted into tow.  The flax was slightly wetted, taken hold of at one end of the bunch, and  drawn through the hackle-teeth towards the hetcheller, and thus fibres  were pulled and laid into continuous threads, while the short fibres  were combed out. It was dusty, dirty work. The threefold process had to  be all done at once; the fibres had to be divided to their fine  filaments, the long threads laid in untangled line, and the tow  separated and removed. After the first hackle, called a ruffler, six  other finer hackles were often used. It was one of the surprises of  flax preparation to see how little good fibre would be left after all  this hackling, even from a large mass of raw material, but it was  equally surprising to see how much linen thread could be made from this  small amount of fine flax. The fibres were sorted according to fineness;  this was called spreading and drawing. So then after over twenty  dexterous manipulations the flax was ready for the wheel, for  spinning,--the most dexterous process of all,--and was wrapped round the  spindle.    Seated at the small flax-wheel, the spinner placed her foot on the  treadle, and spun the fibre into a long, even thread. Hung on the wheel  was a small bone, wood, or earthenware cup, or a gourd-shell, filled  with water, in which the spinner moistened her fingers as she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],[0,"Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#19)"],[1,"in order to avoid the charge of  violating International Law that Sir Edward Grey in the House of  Commons (18 April, 1916) and M. Briand in the Chamber of Deputies (20  June, 1916), affirmed that the Allies had been \"invited.\"  From the  account of that affair already given, the reader will easily see that,  for forensic purposes, both the denial and the affirmation rest on  sufficient grounds.  The discrepancy might be removed by the  substitution of \"instigated\" for \"invited.\"    [15] J. M. N. Jefferies, in the _Daily Mail_, 23 Nov., 1915.  The  testimony is all the more notable because it comes from an avowed  partisan of M. Venizelos: \"the only man in Greece with a policy.\"          {76}    CHAPTER VII    A momentous question--upon the answer to which depended, among other  things, the fate of Greece during the War--confronted the Allies as  soon as they realized that their Balkan campaign had come to an  untimely beginning.    The dispatch of troops to Macedonia originally was based on the  agreement that M. Venizelos would get Greece to join.  Once M.  Venizelos failed to do so, the plan fell to the ground.  Again, the  object of the expedition was to rescue Servia; and Servia being already  conquered, the expedition had no longer any purpose.  Such were the  views of the British Government, and similar views were held in France  by many, including M. Delcasse, who resigned when Bulgaria's  \"defection\" sounded the knell of his Balkan policy.  But other French  statesmen, with M. Briand at their head, saw in Macedonia a field which  promised great glory and gain, if only the noble British nation could  be brought to understand that there were interests and sentiments at  stake higher than agreements.[1]    The process involved some talking: \"I have had my interview with Briand  and Gallieni,\" wrote Lord Kitchener to the Prime Minister.  \"As regards  Salonica it is very difficult to get in a word; they were both full of  the necessity of pushing in troops, and would not think of coming out.  They simply sweep all military difficulties and dangers aside, and go  on political lines--such as saving a remnant of Serbs, bringing Greece  in, and inducing Rumania to join.\" [2]    Other conferences followed, at all of which the French spoke so loudly  that the noble British nation could not possibly help hearing--_la  noble nation britannique n'est pas restee sourde_.  The truth is,  France was set on what {77} M. Delcasse now called the _mirage  balkanique_, partly from considerations of a domestic nature, chiefly  for reasons connected with the future balance of power in the Near  East--and England could not leave her there alone.  So the \"_nous  resterons_\" policy prevailed; and the continued presence of  Franco-British forces on Greek soil led, as it was bound to do, to  abnormal relations with the Greek Government.    The wish of the Allies was to obtain from Greece full licence for the  safe accommodation and the operations of their troops; while it was the  earnest endeavour of Greece not to let her complaisance towards one  group of belligerents compromise her in the eyes of the other.  The  little kingdom found itself between two clashing forces: the one  triumphant on land, the other dominating the sea.  But of the two the  German peril was the more imminent.  The Kaiser's legions were at  Monastir--any act that might be construed as a breach of neutrality  would bring them in a month to Athens.    M. Skouloudis--a stately octogenarian who, after refusing three times  the Premiership, had assumed power in this crisis at the King's  insistent desire because, as he said, he considered it his duty so to  do--took up the only attitude that could have been expected in the  circumstances: the attitude that was dictated by the instinct of  self-preservation.    Unlike M. Venizelos, whose mind revolved constantly about war at all  hazards: unlike other statesmen who regarded war as an eventuality to  be accepted or declined according as conditions might be favourable or  unfavourable, M. Skouloudis seemed resolutely to eliminate war from his  thoughts.    On taking office he gave the Entente Powers \"most categorical  assurances of a steady determination to carry on the policy of  neutrality in the form of most sincere benevolence towards them.  The  new Ministry,\" he added, \"adopts M. Zaimis's repeated declarations of  Greece's friendly attitude towards the Allied armies at Salonica, and  is sufficiently sensible of her true interests and of her debt to them  not to deviate for the whole world from this course, and hopes that the  friendly sentiments of those Powers towards Greece will never be  influenced by false {78} and malicious rumours deliberately put into  circulation with the object of cooling the good relations between  them.\"  To Servia also he expressed \"in the most categorical terms  sentiments of sincere friendship and a steady determination to continue  affording her every facility and support consistent with our vital  interests.\" [3]    But at the same time, when told by the Servian Minister that a Servian  army might probably, pressed by the enemy, enter Greek territory, he  replied that he wished and hoped such a thing would not happen--that  Greece might not find herself under the very unpleasant necessity of  applying the Hague Rules regarding the disarmament of a belligerent  taking refuge in neutral territory.  And he repeated this statement to  the French Minister, adding, in answer to a question.  What would  Greece do if the Allied forces retired into Greek territory? that it  would be necessary to apply the Hague Rules, but that he hoped very  much the contingency would not present itself.  On being reminded of  the assurances given by his predecessor that no material pressure would  ever be exerted on the Allied forces, he replied that the Hellenic  Government nowise proposed to go back on those assurances, and hoped  that the Powers, taking into consideration the irreproachable attitude  of Greece, would be pleased to relieve her of complications and find a  solution safeguarding all interests concerned.[4]    The solution he hinted at was that the Allies should re-embark; in  which case Greece was prepared to protect the parting guests \"even by  her own forces, so as to afford them the most absolute security.\" [5]    But, as nothing was farther from their thoughts, his explanation did  not satisfy the Allies.  M. Skouloudis was therefore obliged to give  their representatives again and again to understand that in no case  would the Hellenic Government think of exerting the least pressure, and  that, if he had alluded to the Rules regarding neutrality, he had done  so because such ought to be the official language of a State which was  and wished to remain neutral.  But from the very first he had clearly  indicated that Greece did not mean to apply those Rules: she would  confine {79} herself to a mere reminder of international principles  without in any way seeking to enforce respect for them.  Greece being  and wishing to remain neutral, could not speak officially as if she  were not, nor trumpet abroad the assurances which she had not ceased  giving the Entente Powers.  Surely they must perceive the most delicate  position in which Greece stood between the two belligerent groups, and,  given that they did not dispute, nor could dispute, her right to remain  neutral, it was reasonable and just that they should accept the natural  consequences and not demand from her impossibilities.[6]    The Entente Powers could not, of course, deny the reasonableness of  this plea; but neither could they ignore the inconveniences to  themselves that would arise from its frank recognition.  Between their  base at Salonica and the troops which had advanced to Krivolak  interposed several Greek army corps; at Salonica also Greek camps lay  among the Franco-British camps scattered round the town: these  conditions impeded organized operations.  General Sarrail, the  Commander-in-Chief of the Allies, had nothing but praise for the  courtesy of the Greek authorities, both civil and military.  Yet not a  day passed without incidents.  He complained that obstacles were placed  in his action through a multitude of secondary details: the  Municipality claimed duties; the Railway Service did not assist as  liberally as could be wished in the work of getting off the stores  which arrived at the port.  It was necessary that the Greek troops  should be moved out of the Allies' way and leave them in full control:  privileges which no State could voluntarily grant and remain neutral;  which no army could forgo and work efficiently.  So the General, while  confessing that \"we often place them in a difficult position by  demanding permissions which their virtual neutrality cannot allow them  to give,\" impressed on the Entente Governments the need of taking  strong measures with the Greeks.[6]    Germany would have proceeded to deeds without wasting words--beyond a  casual \"Necessity knows no law.\"  But nations fighting for noble ideals  could not imitate Germany's cynicism.  A case had to be made out to  {80} justify coercion.  It was.  Greece did not really wish to remain  neutral.  Misled by a Germanophile Court, she only waited for a chance  of joining the enemy--of stabbing the Allies in the back.  When this  amazing theory--widely popularized by the French and English Press--was  hinted to M. Rallis by \"Our Special Correspondent,\" on 18 November, the  Greek Minister could hardly credit his collocutor's sanity: \"It is  mad!\" he cried out.  \"It is senseless to imagine such a thing--when you  could have the guns of your fleet levelled on our cities!\"  The answer,  however--an answer the conclusiveness of which a glance at the map is  enough to demonstrate to the dimmest intelligence--fell upon  deliberately deaf ears.
