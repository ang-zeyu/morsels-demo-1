This tuft, we have been informed, is meant as a handle  by means of which the owner may, after death, be dragged up into heaven!  but we rather incline to the belief that it is left for the purpose of  keeping the red fez or skull-cap on the head.    Be this as it may, no sooner did the urchin behold Mrs Langley, than,  casting aside the towel and ignoring the barber, he rushed out and  exclaimed--in a compound of French, Arabic, and Lingua Franca, of which  we give a free translation--    \"Oh, missus, me massr, console Dansh, vants see ver moch your hosbund!\"    \"Thank you; I know it,\" replied Mrs Langley, giving the boy a small  coin and a bright smile.    Quite satisfied that he had fulfilled his duty, the urchin returned to  the barber and the lady proceeded to the palace.    Here she was received ceremoniously by the father of Ashweesha, Sidi  Cadua, a mild, gentle-spirited, little old Turk, who would have made a  very fine old English gentleman, but who was about as well fitted to be  father-in-law to an Algerine Dey, and a man of position in the pirate  city, as he was to be Prime Minister to the man in the moon.    Sidi Cadua conducted her to the seraglio, where she was heartily  welcomed by the ladies, who expressed their delight at meeting her with  girlish glee.  Ashweesha laughingly said that she was glad to see Agnes  had become a Mohammedan, on which Mrs Langley related what  circumstances had caused the change, and the Sultana listened to the  recital with tears of laughter running down her cheeks.    The English lady had naturally expected something gorgeous in the  palace, but she was not prepared for the lavish display of wealth that  met her eyes everywhere.    She found the Sultana and her six beautiful children in a room which,  though not imposing in size, glittered with decoration.  The ceiling and  walls were rich with tessellated and arabesque work.  The floor was  covered with a carpet of cut velvet, with a pattern of the richest and  most brightly-coloured flowers; and this carpet was strewn with costly  jewels, which shone in the variegated light of the stained-glass windows  above like glowing fire-flies.  Around the walls were several recesses  or niches, arched in the Moorish horse-shoe style.  In one of these was  a glass cabinet, on the shelves of which were some splendid articles of  jewellery.  In another recess hung a variety of swords and pistols,  chiefly of Eastern manufacture, their handles and scabbards blazing with  diamonds.  Opposite to these stood a gilt four-post European bedstead,  with four mattresses of gold brocade, and curtains of blue tiffany  embroidered with gold sprigs.  In fact, the apartment and its occupants  were adorned with so much magnificence that the genie of Aladdin's  famous lamp would not have improved it, for, although that remarkable  personage might have brought unlimited treasure to its decoration, he  would not have found a spare inch anywhere on which to bestow it!    The Sultana and her children were alone, with the exception of  half-a-dozen beautiful Georgian slaves, and one or two negresses, who  attended on them.  Of course no gentlemen were present!    \"My husband is very fond of yours,\" said Ashweesha, with a pleasant  smile, leading her guests to a large cushion on the floor, and squatting  them down beside her.    \"It gratifies me much to hear you say so,\" replied Mrs Langley.    They spoke in a jargon of languages, and made up their deficiencies by  signs, of which we dare not attempt a characteristic translation.    \"He sent you a new slave-girl lately, I believe?\" said the Sultana,  beginning to feel her way.    \"Yes,\" exclaimed the guest with animation, \"it was _very_ kind of him;  and I find her _so_ sweet and amiable, and useful too.  She assists me  with my dear baby so admirably, as well as with the household, that I  begin already to feel as if I could not get on without her.  Do you know  I have set my heart on raising sufficient money to ransom her and set  her free?\"    \"Then you will only lose her, for she will certainly go home to her  husband,\" observed Ashweesha, with a look of simplicity.    \"Of course; I count on that,\" returned Mrs Langley.  \"You know that we  Christians differ from Mohammedans widely on the point of slavery; and I  am sure,\" she added playfully, \"you will not think me rude when I say  that I mean to take advantage of your laws, and procure the ransom of as  many slaves as possible during my residence here.\"    \"If you had the wealth of a king,\" said Ashweesha, with a smile, \"you  could not ransom the half of them, they are so numerous.\"    \"I am too well aware of that,\" rejoined the other sadly; \"nevertheless,  that does not exempt me from my duty.  In the laws of my heavenly King  and Saviour Jesus Christ it is written--`Whatsoever thy hand findeth to  do, do it with thy might.'\"    The Sultana bent a keen look of interest on her guest, and was about to  reply, but seemed to change her mind, and said:--    \"It was Sidi Hassan, I am told, who brought in this slave-girl; and, by  the way, I hear that he has become your janissary.  Do you like him?\"    \"I have seen so little of him that I can hardly tell.--You have walked  with him in the garden, Agnes, several times; what do _you_ think of  him?\"    \"I don't like him at _all_!\" answered Agnes, with powerful emphasis.    Both ladies laughed, and so did the six little daughters of the Sultana,  who had maintained a dignified silence while their elders were  conversing.    \"My little girl is rather given to take hasty prejudices,\" said Mrs  Langley apologetically.    \"Does your husband find him useful?\" continued the Sultana, returning to  the charge.    \"No doubt he does, but I really cannot say, for my husband has only  mentioned him casually, and I never venture to speak of his business  affairs unless called on to do so.  The fact that Sidi Hassan has been  much oftener in town than at our residence since he was sent to us, may  account for my slight knowledge about him.\"    \"Oh! he has been very often in town, has he?\" exclaimed Ashweesha.    Before Mrs Langley could reply, an attendant announced that dinner was  served in the adjoining room, whereupon the Georgian slaves were ordered  to pick up the jewels that strewed the carpet.  This they did, and,  having locked them in the glass cabinet before mentioned, followed the  party into the dining-room.    It was a somewhat peculiar dinner in many respects.  There was great  variety.  Meat, poultry, pastry, and sweatmeats of strange kinds and  forms, succeeded each other, and were done full justice to by all  present.  It was like a glimpse of paradise to little Agnes; for, having  been brought up in the simplest of styles, and forbidden pastry and  sweatmeats altogether since the day of her birth, she absolutely  revelled in new sensations.    It must not be supposed that she violently broke through all restraints  on this occasion; but her mother saw that if old rules were enforced,  the child would be confused by the conflicting entreaties of her  hostesses and the denials of her mother, while the Sultana might be  offended.  Mrs Langley, therefore, gave her _carte-blanche_ to eat what  she pleased.    The party all sat on embroidered cushions on the floor, round a small  low table made of silver and mother-of-pearl.  On this, each dish was  placed separately; and all ate out of the same dish, after the Moorish  fashion.  The spoons were made of rosewood, tipped with amber, and the  napkins were richly embroidered in gold, silver, and variously coloured  silk on a curiously-wrought linen ground.  All the vessels used were of  the most elaborate and costly description, and we need scarcely add that  the viands were good.  Among other things there was fish, which was  served and eaten with honey! but the chief among the dishes was  kooskoos.  This was the _piece de resistance_ of the Moorish  dinner-table, the substance on which the ladies chiefly fed and  flourished.  To be fat was, in those days, the most desirable attribute  of a wife in the eyes of an Algerine husband, therefore kooskoos was  eaten in quantity.  It was made largely of flour, rolled, in some  mystical manner, into the form of little pellets, like small sago; this,  boiled with butter and other fatty substances, with bits of meat and  chicken, and other viands mixed through it,--the whole being slightly  seasoned and spiced,--was deemed food fit for a Sultana.    During the meal they became very chatty, and the young people paid much  attention to Agnes, who, being a sensitively good girl, felt, every time  that she experienced a new taste, as though she were breaking all the  Ten Commandments, notwithstanding the permission of her mother!    Several times Ashweesha turned the conversation on the home affairs of  her guests, and attempted to gain further information about Sidi  Hassan's doings, but found, much to her annoyance, that Mrs Langley  knew little more than she had already communicated.  Her good-humour  was, however, restored by that lady's unaffected admiration of the  numerous lovely things by which she was surrounded.  She specially  praised the splendid napkins and the spoons before referred to, and when  they rose from table, the Sultana presented her and Agnes with those  that they had used.    After giving them coffee and making another vain attempt to extract  information, Ashweesha dismissed her guests, who returned home charmed  with the novelty of their reception and entertainment.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    RELATES SOMETHING ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS, SURPRISES, AND CHANGES IN THE  STATE OF AFFAIRS.    In consequence of the opportune interference of the British consul, and  of the good-will which Lucien had inspired in the breast of the Dey, a  ray of light stole into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#19)"],[1,"shots were heard away on their right, and two of the  advancing bandits fell.  An instant later, and Quashy bounded upon the  scene with a high trumpet-shriek like a wild elephant.  Pedro followed,  brandishing the rifle which he had just discharged with such fatal  effect.  Lawrence joined them with a genuine British cheer, but their  adversaries did not await the onset.  They turned, fled, and speedily  scattered themselves among the ruins.    \"T'ank God, massa, we's in time,\" said Quashy, wiping with his sleeve  the perspiration that streamed from his face, as they returned quickly  to Manuela.    \"We must not wait a moment here,\" said Pedro, hurriedly.  \"There may be  more of the villains about.  But you are wounded, Senhor Armstrong.\"    \"Not badly,\" said Lawrence.  \"It might have been worse, but the fellow  was in such a hurry that the edge of his sabre turned, and I got only a  blow with the side of it.  If I had only had my good cudgel--by the way,  it must be in the hole.  It was in my hand when--Stay, I'll return in a  few seconds.\"    He ran back to his late tomb, and quickly returned in triumph with his  favourite weapon.    \"Come, we must get away from this at once,\" said Pedro, turning to  Manuela.  \"No time for explanations.  Are you hurt?\"    \"No; thank God.  Let us go,\" replied the girl, who was pale and haggard,  as she staggered towards them.    \"Take my arm,\" said Lawrence, presenting his wounded limb.    The girl pointed with trembling hand to the blood.    \"It is nothing--a mere scratch,\" said Lawrence.    In his anxiety he forgot to speak in Spanish.  Manuela appeared as if  about to sink with fear.  He caught her, lifted her in his arms as if  she had been a little child, and, following Pedro's lead, left the place  which had been the scene of so many terrible events.    In the outskirts of the town there was a large low building of mud or  sun-dried bricks, which had not been overthrown by the earthquake.  To  this Pedro conducted his companions.  They found room in the place,  though it was nearly full of survivors in all conditions of injury,--  from those who had got mere scratches and bruises, to those who had been  so crushed and mangled that life was gradually ebbing away.  There  seemed to be about fifty people in the room, and every minute more were  being brought in.    Here Lawrence set down his burden, who had by that time quite recovered,  and turned quickly to the guide.    \"Come, Pedro,\" he said, \"I can be of use here; but we must have my own  wound dressed first.  You can do it, I doubt not.\"    Pedro professed to be not only able but willing.  Before he did it,  however, he whispered in a low tone, yet with much emphasis, to  Manuela--    \"Don't forget yourself!  Remember!\"    As he whispered pretty loud, and in Spanish, Lawrence overheard and  understood him, and puzzled himself, not only that day, but for many  days and nights after, as to how it was possible that Manuela _could_  forget herself, and what it was she had to remember.  But the more and  the longer he puzzled over it, the less did he clear up his mind on the  subject.    When it became known that Lawrence was a doctor, there was a visible  increase of hope in the expression and bearing of the poor wounded  people.  And the youth soon justified their trustful feelings, for, with  Pedro and Quashy as assistant-surgeons, and Manuela as head-nurse, he  went about setting broken bones, bandaging limbs, sewing up wounds, and  otherwise relieving the sufferers around him.    While this was going on the poor people were recounting many marvellous  tales of terrible risks run, escapes made, and dangers evaded.  During  all this time, too, frequent shocks of earthquake were felt, of greater  or less violence, and these afterwards continued daily for a month, so  that the few buildings which had partially survived the first awful  shock were finally levelled like the rest.    When Lawrence with his assistants had gone the rounds of the  extemporised hospital, he was so completely worn out that he could  scarcely keep his eyes open.  Swallowing a cup of hot coffee hastily, he  flung himself on a heap of straw beside one of his patients, and almost  instantly fell into a profound lethargic slumber.    There was an unoccupied arm-chair in the room.  Placing this beside the  youth's couch, the Indian girl sat down with a fan, purposing, in her  gratitude, to protect her preserver from the mosquitoes, which were  having an unusual bout of revelry over the sufferers that night.    Quashy, observing this as he lay down in a corner, shook his head sadly,  and whispered to himself:    \"Ah! you brown gal, you's in lub wid massa.  But it's useless.  De ole  story ob unrekited affection; for you know, pretty though you is, massa  kin nebber marry a squaw!\"    Thus thinking, Quashy went sweetly to sleep.    So did most of the others in that crowded place.  But Manuela stuck to  her colours nobly.  She kept awake until her pretty black eyes became  lustreless, until her pretty brown face became expressionless, until the  effort to continue awake became hopeless.  Then her little head fell  back on the cushion of the chair, the little mouth opened, and the large  eyes closed.  The little hand which held the fan dropped by her side.  The fan itself dropped on the floor, and, like the others, poor Manuela  at length found rest and solace in slumber.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Note 1.  A similar disaster, accompanied by dreadful scenes of  lawlessness and horror, occurred in 1861, when the city of Mendoza was  totally destroyed by an earthquake, and nine-tenths of the inhabitants  perished.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    OUTWITTED BY A BANDIT.    Early next morning Pedro went round and quietly roused his friends.    \"We must start at once,\" he said in a low voice to Lawrence, when the  wearied youth was sufficiently awake to understand.  \"Your wounded arm  is better, I hope?\"    \"It is only stiff and painful; happily, no bones are injured.  But why  such haste?  I don't like to leave my poor patients in this fashion.\"    \"Will any of them die if you don't stay to nurse them?\" asked the guide,  with a grave, almost stern, expression.    \"Why, no; not exactly,\" returned Lawrence; \"but many of them will want  their wounds dressed, and all of them will be the better for a little  more skilled attendance.\"    \"Will they not survive under ordinary attendance?\" asked Pedro, with  increasing severity of expression.    \"Doubtless they will, but--\"    \"Would you like,\" interrupted the inflexible guide, \"to have them all  roused up at this early hour to hear a little farewell speech from you,  explaining the absolute necessity for your going away, and your extreme  regret at leaving them?\"    \"Not if there is such necessity,\" returned Lawrence, yawning, and  raising himself on one elbow.    \"There _is_ such necessity, senhor.  I have been down to the village  where my friend lives, and have got fresh horses.  Manuela and Quashy  are already mounted.  I let you sleep to the last moment, seeing you  were so tired.  Don't forget your pistols; you may need them.\"    Without waiting for a reply, he rose and left the room.  The young  doctor hesitated no longer.  Regret at quitting the poor people around  him was overborne by the fear of being left behind, for he had by that  time begun to entertain a vague suspicion that the stern and peculiar  man by whom he was led would not permit any object whatever to stand in  the way of what he believed to be his duty.    In a few seconds he issued from the hut, armed with his pair of  double-barrelled pistols and the faithful cudgel.  The cavalry sabre,  however, had been lost, not much to his regret.    The grey light of dawn was just sufficient to give a ghostly appearance  to what may be truly termed the ghastly ruins around them, and to reveal  in undefined solemnity the neighbouring mountains.  Smoke still issued  from the half-smothered fires, and here and there a spectral figure  might be seen flitting silently to and fro.  But all was profoundly  still and quiet, even the occasional tremors of the earth had ceased for  a time, when they issued from the enclosure of the hut.    Without speaking, Lawrence mounted the horse which stood ready for him,  and they all rode silently away, picking their steps with great care  through the upheaved and obstructed streets.  It was a scene of absolute  and utter ruin, which Lawrence felt could never be effaced from his  memory, but must remain there burned in deeply, in its minutest details,  to the end of time.    When they had passed the suburbs, however, and reached the country  beyond, the depressing influences passed away, and, a certain degree of  cheerfulness returning with the sun, they began to chat and to explain  to each other their various experiences.    \"Of course, when I felt the earthquake,\" said Pedro to Lawrence, \"I knew  that, although little damage was done to the village to which I had gone  in search of my friends, it must have been very severe on the town with  its spires and public buildings; so I saddled up at once, and set off on  my return.  I met Quashy just as I left the village, and we both spurred  back as fast as we could.  When we came in sight of it, we saw at once  that the place was destroyed, but, until we reached it, had no idea of  the completeness of the destruction.  We could not even find the road  that led to the inn where we had left you and Manuela; and it was not  till the following morning that we found the inn itself, and came up, as  you know, just in time to help you, though we had sought diligently all  night.\"    \"Das so, massa,\" broke in Quashy, who had listened with glittering eyes  to Pedro's narrative, which of course was much more extended and full,  \"an' you's got no notion how we's banged about our poor shins among dese  ruins afore we founded you.
