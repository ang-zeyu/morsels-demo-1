But, in truth, the scrupulosity of the Puritan was not  that sort of scrupulosity which the Apostle had commanded believers to  respect. It sprang, not from morbid tenderness of conscience, but from  censoriousness and spiritual pride; and none who had studied the New  Testament could have failed to observe that, while we are charged  carefully to avoid whatever may give scandal to the feeble, we are  taught by divine precept and example to make no concession to the  supercilious and uncharitable Pharisee. Was every thing which was not of  the essence of religion to be given up as soon as it became unpleasing  to a knot of zealots whose heads had been turned by conceit and the love  of novelty? Painted glass, music, holidays, fast days, were not of the  essence of religion. Were the windows of King's College Chapel to be  broken at the demand of one set of fanatics? Was the organ of Exeter  to be silenced to please another? Were all the village bells to be mute  because Tribulation Wholesome and Deacon Ananias thought them profane?  Was Christmas no longer to be a day of rejoicing? Was Passion week no  longer to be a season of humiliation? These changes, it is true, were  not yet proposed. Put if,--so the High Churchmen reasoned,--we once  admit that what is harmless and edifying is to be given up because it  offends some narrow understandings and some gloomy tempers, where are  we to stop? And is it not probable that, by thus attempting to heal one  schism, we may cause another? All those things which the Puritans regard  as the blemishes of the Church are by a large part of the population  reckoned among her attractions. May she not, in ceasing to give scandal  to a few sour precisians, cease also to influence the hearts of many  who now delight in her ordinances? Is it not to be apprehended that, for  every proselyte whom she allures from the meeting house, ten of her old  disciples may turn away from her maimed rites and dismantled temples,  and that these new separatists may either form themselves into a  sect far more formidable than the sect which we are now seeking to  conciliate, or may, in the violence of their disgust at a cold and  ignoble worship, be tempted to join in the solemn and gorgeous idolatry  of Rome?    It is remarkable that those who held this language were by no means  disposed to contend for the doctrinal Articles of the Church. The truth  is that, from the time of James the First, that great party which has  been peculiarly zealous for the Anglican polity and the Anglican ritual  has always leaned strongly towards Arminianism, and has therefore never  been much attached to a confession of faith framed by reformers who, on  questions of metaphysical divinity, generally agreed with Calvin. One of  the characteristic marks of that party is the disposition which it has  always shown to appeal, on points of dogmatic theology, rather to the  Liturgy, which was derived from Rome, than to the Articles and Homilies,  which were derived from Geneva. The Calvinistic members of the Church,  on the other hand, have always maintained that her deliberate judgment  on such points is much more likely to be found in an Article or a Homily  than in an ejaculation of penitence or a hymn of thanksgiving. It does  not appear that, in the debates on the Comprehension Bill, a single High  Churchman raised his voice against the clause which relieved the clergy  from the necessity of subscribing the Articles, and of declaring the  doctrine contained in the Homilies to be sound. Nay, the Declaration  which, in the original draught, was substituted for the Articles, was  much softened down on the report. As the clause finally stood, the  ministers of the Church were required to declare, not that they approved  of her constitution, but merely that they submitted to it. Had the bill  become law, the only people in the kingdom who would have been under  the necessity of signing the Articles would have been the dissenting  preachers. [88]    The easy manner in which the zealous friends of the Church gave up her  confession of faith presents a striking contrast to the spirit with  which they struggled for her polity and her ritual. The clause which  admitted Presbyterian ministers to hold benefices without episcopal  ordination was rejected. The clause which permitted scrupulous persons  to communicate sitting very narrowly escaped the same fate. In the  Committee it was struck out, and, on the report, was with great  difficulty restored. The majority of peers in the House was against the  proposed indulgence, and the scale was but just turned by the proxies.    But by this time it began to appear that the bill which the High  Churchmen were so keenly assailing was menaced by dangers from a very  different quarter. The same considerations which had induced Nottingham  to support a comprehension made comprehension an object of dread and  aversion to a large body of dissenters. The truth is that the time  for such a scheme had gone by. If, a hundred years earlier, when the  division in the Protestant body was recent, Elizabeth had been so wise  as to abstain from requiring the observance of a few forms which a  large part of her subjects considered as Popish, she might perhaps have  averted those fearful calamities which, forty years after her death,  afflicted the Church. But the general tendency of schism is to widen.  Had Leo the Tenth, when the exactions and impostures of the Pardoners  first roused the indignation of Saxony, corrected those evil practices  with a vigorous hand, it is not improbable that Luther would have died  in the bosom of the Church of Rome. But the opportunity was suffered  to escape; and, when, a few years later, the Vatican would gladly  have purchased peace by yielding the original subject of quarrel, the  original subject of quarrel was almost forgotten. The inquiring spirit  which had been roused by a single abuse had discovered or imagined a  thousand: controversies engendered controversies: every attempt that  was made to accommodate one dispute ended by producing another; and  at length a General Council, which, during the earlier stages of the  distemper, had been supposed to be an infallible remedy, made the case  utterly hopeless. In this respect, as in many others, the history  of Puritanism in England bears a close analogy to the history of  Protestantism in Europe. The Parliament of 1689 could no more put an end  to nonconformity by tolerating a garb or a posture than the Doctors  of Trent could have reconciled the Teutonic nations to the Papacy by  regulating the sale of indulgences. In the sixteenth century Quakerism  was unknown; and there was not in the whole realm a single congregation  of Independents or Baptists. At the time of the Revolution, the  Independents, Baptists, and Quakers were a majority of the dissenting  body; and these sects could not be gained over on any terms which  the lowest of Low Churchmen would have been willing to offer. The  Independent held that a national Church, governed by any central  authority whatever, Pope, Patriarch, King, Bishop, or Synod, was an  unscriptural institution, and that every congregation of believers  was, under Christ, a sovereign society. The Baptist was even  more irreclaimable than the Independent, and the Quaker even more  irreclaimable than the Baptist. Concessions, therefore, which would once  have extinguished nonconformity would not now satisfy even one half  of the nonconformists; and it was the obvious interest of every  nonconformist whom no concession would satisfy that none of his brethren  should be satisfied. The more liberal the terms of comprehension, the  greater was the alarm of every separatist who knew that he could, in no  case, be comprehended. There was but slender hope that the dissenters,  unbroken and acting as one man, would be able to obtain from the  legislature full admission to civil privileges; and all hope of  obtaining such admission must be relinquished if Nottingham should,  by the help of some wellmeaning but shortsighted friends of religious  liberty, be enabled to accomplish his design. If his bill passed, there  would doubtless be a considerable defection from the dissenting  body; and every defection must be severely felt by a class already  outnumbered, depressed, and struggling against powerful enemies. Every  proselyte too must be reckoned twice over, as a loss to the party which  was even now too weak, and as a gain to the party which was even now too  strong. The Church was but too well able to hold her own against all the  sects in the kingdom; and, if those sects were to be thinned by a large  desertion, and the Church strengthened by a large reinforcement, it was  plain that all chance of obtaining any relaxation of the Test Act would  be at an end; and it was but too probable that the Toleration Act might  not long remain unrepealed.    Even those Presbyterian ministers whose scruples the Comprehension Bill  was expressly intended to remove were by no means unanimous in wishing  it to pass. The ablest and most eloquent preachers among them had, since  the Declaration of Indulgence had appeared, been very agreeably settled  in the capital and in other large towns, and were now about to enjoy,  under the sure guarantee of an Act of Parliament, that toleration which,  under the Declaration of Indulgence, had been illicit and precarious.  The situation of these men was such as the great majority of the divines  of the Established Church might well envy. Few indeed of the parochial  clergy were so abundantly supplied with comforts as the favourite  orator of a great assembly of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2613"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 4 (#19)"],[1," Ginkell might be stopped by those  walls from which William had, in the preceding year, been forced to  retreat. But many of the Irish chiefs loudly declared that it was  time to think of capitulating. Henry Luttrell, always fond of dark and  crooked politics, opened a secret negotiation with the English. One of  his letters was intercepted; and he was put under arrest; but many  who blamed his perfidy agreed with him in thinking that it was idle to  prolong the contest. Tyrconnel himself was convinced that all was lost.  His only hope was that he might be able to prolong the struggle till  he could receive from Saint Germains permission to treat. He wrote to  request that permission, and prevailed, with some difficulty, on his  desponding countrymen to bind themselves by an oath not to capitulate  till an answer from James should arrive. [113]    A few days after the oath had been administered, Tyrconnel was no more.  On the eleventh of August he dined with D'Usson. The party was gay. The  Lord Lieutenant seemed to have thrown off the load which had bowed down  his body and mind; he drank; he jested; he was again the Dick Talbot  who had diced and revelled with Grammont. Soon after he had risen from  table, an apoplectic stroke deprived him of speech and sensation. On the  fourteenth he breathed his last. The wasted remains of that form which  had once been a model for statuaries were laid under the pavement of the  Cathedral; but no inscription, no tradition, preserves the memory of the  spot. [114]    As soon as the Lord Lieutenant was no more, Plowden, who had  superintended the Irish finances while there were any Irish finances to  superintend, produced a commission under the great seal of James. This  commission appointed Plowden himself, Fitton and Nagle, Lords justices  in the event of Tyrconnel's death. There was much murmuring when the  names were made known. For both Plowden and Fitton were Saxons. The  commission, however, proved to be a mere nullity. For it was accompanied  by instructions which forbade the Lords justices to interfere in the  conduct of the war; and, within the narrow space to which the dominions  of James were now reduced, war was the only business. The government  was, therefore, really in the hands of D'Usson and Sarsfield. [115]    On the day on which Tyrconnel died, the advanced guard of the English  army came within sight of Limerick. Ginkell encamped on the same ground  which William had occupied twelve months before. The batteries, on which  were planted guns and bombs, very different from those which William had  been forced to use, played day and night; and soon roofs were blazing  and walls crashing in every corner of the city. Whole streets were  reduced to ashes. Meanwhile several English ships of war came up the  Shannon and anchored about a mile below the city. [116]    Still the place held out; the garrison was, in numerical strength,  little inferior to the besieging army; and it seemed not impossible  that the defence might be prolonged till the equinoctial rains should a  second time compel the English to retire. Ginkell determined on striking  a bold stroke. No point in the whole circle of the fortifications was  more important, and no point seemed to be more secure, than the Thomond  Bridge, which joined the city to the camp of the Irish horse on the  Clare bank of the Shannon. The Dutch General's plan was to separate the  infantry within the ramparts from the cavalry without; and this plan he  executed with great skill, vigour and success. He laid a bridge of  tin boats on the river, crossed it with a strong body of troops, drove  before him in confusion fifteen hundred dragoons who made a faint show  of resistance, and marched towards the quarters of the Irish horse. The  Irish horse sustained but ill on this day the reputation which they had  gained at the Boyne. Indeed, that reputation had been purchased by  the almost entire destruction of the best regiments. Recruits had been  without much difficulty found. But the loss of fifteen hundred excellent  soldiers was not to be repaired. The camp was abandoned without a blow.  Some of the cavalry fled into the city. The rest, driving before them  as many cattle as could be collected in that moment of panic, retired to  the hills. Much beef, brandy and harness was found in the magazines; and  the marshy plain of the Shannon was covered with firelocks and grenades  which the fugitives had thrown away. [117]    The conquerors returned in triumph to their camp. But Ginkell was not  content with the advantage which he had gained. He was bent on cutting  off all communication between Limerick and the county of Clare. In a  few days, therefore, he again crossed the river at the head of several  regiments, and attacked the fort which protected the Thomond Bridge. In  a short time the fort was stormed. The soldiers who had garrisoned it  fled in confusion to the city. The Town Major, a French officer, who  commanded at the Thomond Gate, afraid that the pursuers would enter with  the fugitives, ordered that part of the bridge which was nearest to the  city to be drawn up. Many of the Irish went headlong into the stream and  perished there. Others cried for quarter, and held up handkerchiefs  in token of submission. But the conquerors were mad with rage; their  cruelty could not be immediately restrained; and no prisoners were made  till the heaps of corpses rose above the parapets. The garrison of the  fort had consisted of about eight hundred men. Of these only a hundred  and twenty escaped into Limerick. [118]    This disaster seemed likely to produce a general mutiny in the besieged  city. The Irish clamoured for the blood of the Town Major who  had ordered the bridge to be drawn up in the face of their flying  countrymen. His superiors were forced to promise that he should be  brought before a court martial. Happily for him, he had received a  mortal wound, in the act of closing the Thomond Gate, and was saved by  a soldier's death from the fury of the multitude. [119] The cry for  capitulation became so loud and importunate that the generals could not  resist it. D'Usson informed his government that the fight at the  bridge had so effectually cowed the spirit of the garrison that it was  impossible to continue the struggle. [120] Some exception may perhaps  be taken to the evidence of D'Usson; for undoubtedly he, like every  Frenchman who had held any command in the Irish army, was weary of his  banishment, and impatient to see Paris again. But it is certain that  even Sarsfield had lost heart. Up to this time his voice had been for  stubborn resistance. He was now not only willing, but impatient to  treat. [121] It seemed to him that the city was doomed. There was no  hope of succour, domestic or foreign. In every part of Ireland the  Saxons had set their feet on the necks of the natives. Sligo had fallen.  Even those wild islands which intercept the huge waves of the Atlantic  from the bay of Galway had acknowledged the authority of William. The  men of Kerry, reputed the fiercest and most ungovernable part of the  aboriginal population, had held out long, but had at length been routed,  and chased to their woods and mountains. [122] A French fleet, if a  French fleet were now to arrive on the coast of Munster, would find  the mouth of the Shannon guarded by English men of war. The stock of  provisions within Limerick was already running low. If the siege were  prolonged, the town would, in all human probability, be reduced either  by force or by blockade. And, if Ginkell should enter through the  breach, or should be implored by a multitude perishing with hunger  to dictate his own terms, what could be expected but a tyranny more  inexorably severe than that of Cromwell? Would it not then be wise  to try what conditions could be obtained while the victors had still  something to fear from the rage and despair of the vanquished; while  the last Irish army could still make some show of resistance behind the  walls of the last Irish fortress?    On the evening of the day which followed the fight at the Thomond  Gate, the drums of Limerick beat a parley; and Wauchop, from one of the  towers, hailed the besiegers, and requested Ruvigny to grant Sarsfield  an interview. The brave Frenchman who was an exile on account of his  attachment to one religion, and the brave Irishman who was about  to become an exile on account of his attachment to another, met and  conferred, doubtless with mutual sympathy and respect. [123] Ginkell,  to whom Ruvigny reported what had passed, willingly consented to an  armistice. For, constant as his success had been, it had not made him  secure. The chances were greatly on his side. Yet it was possible that  an attempt to storm the city might fail, as a similar attempt had failed  twelve months before. If the siege should be turned into a blockade,  it was probable that the pestilence which had been fatal to the army of  Schomberg, which had compelled William to retreat, and which had all but  prevailed even against the genius and energy of Marlborough, might soon  avenge the carnage of Aghrim. The rains had lately been heavy. The whole  plain might shortly be an immense pool of stagnant water. It might be  necessary to move the troops to a healthier situation than the bank  of the Shannon, and to provide for them a warmer shelter than that of  tents. The enemy would be safe till the spring. In the spring a French  army might land in Ireland; the natives might again rise in arms from  Donegal to Kerry; and the war, which was now all but extinguished, might  blaze forth fiercer than ever.    A negotiation was therefore opened with a sincere desire on both sides  to put an end to the contest. The chiefs of the Irish army held several  consultations at which some Roman Catholic prelates and some eminent  lawyers were invited to assist. A preliminary question, which perplexed  tender"]]]
