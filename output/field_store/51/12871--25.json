Out of the merriness of his heart he thrummed his harp with so blithe  and strange a tune that in a little while the very folk upon the shore  came listening, and some began to dance, while others looked sad. For  though the tune was very merry, there was sadness also peeping from it.    It happened that King Anguish and his court were in that castle by the  sea, and a handmaiden of the queen came to where they sat and told them  of the knight that sat in his ship and harped so strange a lay that it  made one glad and sorry at the same time.    Then King Anguish sent a knight and begged the harper to take cheer  with him, and Sir Tristram was brought in a litter, and all the damsels  were sad at his sickness, and the knights sorrowed that a knight so  noble-looking should be so wounded. King Anguish asked him who he was  and how he came by his wound. And Sir Tristram, having learned that  this was the King of Ireland, whose champion he had worsted in the  battle, and thinking that his own name would be known, replied:    'I am of the country of Lyones, and my name is Sir Tramor, and my wound  was got in battle, as I fought for a lady's right.'    'I pity thee, sir knight,' said the king, who was a right noble king  and lovable, 'and by Heaven's aid, ye shall have all the help in this  country that ye may need.'    The king told him of the battle which Sir Marhaus had had on his behalf  with a knight named Sir Tristram, and how Sir Marhaus had come home  wounded unto death, and was dead this two months. On which Sir Tristram  feigned to be sorry, but said not much thereon.    Then did the king order his daughter to come before him. She was called  La Belle Isoude, for that she was the most lovely damsel in all Ireland  and the Out-Isles, and withal gentle and kind; and her father bade her  tend and minister to this stranger knight, who had come to Ireland to  heal him of his wound.    In a few weeks, so soft was she of her hands and so learned in  leechcraft, she had cleaned Tristram's wound of all poison and he was  hale and strong again. As some reward he taught her to harp, and gave  her many good and costly presents. These she took, but valued them not  so much as his kind words and smiles. More and more she loved to hear  his voice, and when he was gone out hawking or looking at jousts she  was sad and thoughtful, sitting with her fair hands in her lap and her  eyes looking far away, and when she heard his step or his voice in the  hall, then would her sad eyes light up, and a merry tune would hum upon  her lips, and she would gaily talk with her handmaidens, who,  whispering and glancing and nodding to each other as they sat about her  at their spinning frames, knew of her love for Sir Tristram before she  was aware of it herself.    Sir Tristram cared not overmuch to be with ladies, but was more joyful  to be in hall, talking of hunting, jousting and hawking. All men  regarded him highly for his great knowledge of these things, but as  yet, for fear of hurting his wound which was but freshly healed, La  Belle Isoude forbade him gently to take violent exercise. Sir Tristram  was impatient to be in the saddle again, with lance in rest and his  great charger leaping beneath him.    Now, to the court of King Anguish there had lately come a knight named  Sir Palomides, famed for his knightly deeds, though still a pagan, and  he was well favoured both of King Anguish and his queen. Sir Palomides  came and made great court to La Belle Isoude, and proffered her many  gifts, for he loved her passing well. Indeed, for her sake he declared  he would be christened and become a Christian knight; but La Belle  Isoude had no care for him, and avoided him as well as she might.    On a certain day King Anguish made a great cry that a joust and  tournament would be held, wherein only unmarried knights should join,  and the prize would be a fair lady called the Lady of the Laundes, near  cousin to the king. The heralds further said that he who should win her  should marry her three days after, and have all her lands with her.  This cry was made in all Ireland and Wales, and in Logres and Alban,  which are now called England and Scotland.    It befell the same day that La Belle Isoude came to Sir Tristram, and  she seemed distressed of mind and as if she had wept secretly.    'Sir Tramor,' she said, 'this tournament shall exalt Sir Palomides  beyond all other knights, unless a better do come forward and overcome  him.'    'Fair lady,' said Sir Tristram, 'Sir Palomides may well win the prize  against any knight, except it be Sir Lancelot. But if ye think I am fit  to joust I will e'en essay it. Yet he is a proved knight, and I but a  young one and but lately ill; and my first battle that I fought, it  mishapped me to be sore wounded. Yet I will essay it, for I love not  this Sir Palomides.'    'Ah, but I know thou wilt do well in the battle, and thou shalt have  all my prayers for thy safety and success,' said La Belle Isoude.    On the first day of the jousts Sir Palomides came with a black shield,  and he was a knight big of his body and on a great horse. He overthrew  many knights and put them to the worst, among them being many of the  knights of the Round Table, as Sir Gawaine and his brother Sir Gaheris,  Sir Agravaine, Sir Kay, Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Owen, who had  been the little page-boy who had saved King Arthur's life in his hall  at Caerleon, and three other knights. All these he struck down, and the  others were adread of him. The people had great marvel, and acclaimed  him with much worship as the victor of the first day.    The next day he came and smote down King Morgant, the pagan King of  Scotland, as also the Duke of Cambenet. Then, as he rode up and down  the lists proudly flourishing his lance, dressing his shield and  waiting for the other knights to offer themselves to him, he was aware  of a knight all in white armour, with vizor closed, riding quickly  through the gate as if he came from the seashore.    The stranger knight came with swiftness, lifting his lance in token of  challenge. Whereat Sir Palomides rode to the other end of the lists,  dressed his lance, and together they put their horses in motion. Like  two bulls the knights thundered against each other in the centre of the  lists. The white knight's lance hit the shield of Sir Palomides full in  the centre, and with the shock the pagan knight was lifted from his  saddle, carried beyond his horse, and fell with a great thud to the  ground, while his horse careered onward riderless.    Sir Gawaine and his fellows marvelled who this stranger knight might  be. Then Sir Palomides, rising from the ground, caught his horse, and  full of shame, would have slunk from the field. But the white knight  rode after him and bade him turn, 'for,' said the stranger, 'he would  better prove him with the sword.'    Then, alighting, they lashed at each other with their swords. Now Sir  Palomides was a powerful man, and his strokes were passing heavy, but  Sir Tristram, for the stranger knight was he, felt so full of strength  and joy after his long leisure, that he played with Sir Palomides, and  men wondered at the might of his blows, and his swiftness was a marvel  to see. In a while, with a great buffet on the head of the pagan  knight, Sir Tristram felled him to the earth.    'Now yield thee,' said the white knight sternly, 'and do my command, or  I will slay thee of a surety.'    Sir Palomides was sore adread, and promised.    'Swear me this,' said the stranger, 'that upon pain of thy life thou  leave my lady La Belle Isoude, and come not unto her ever again, and  for a year and a day thou shalt bear no armour. Promise me this, or  here shalt thou die!'    'I swear it,' said Sir Palomides, 'but I am for ever shamed.'    In his rage Sir Palomides cut off his armour and threw it from him and  fled away on his horse.    Then the white knight also went away, and none knew who he was. The  king sent after him, to tell him he was the winner of the lady, whom he  should wed, but the messengers could not find him. Men marvelled much  at this, that the victor knight should not come to claim the rich lady  for his wife with the wide lands that went with her.    When Sir Tristram returned to the private postern where La Belle Isoude  had led him forth secretly, he found her standing breathless, and she  was pale and red by turns, and could not speak at first.    'Thou--thou hast not failed?' she said, and clasped her hands.    'Nay,' said Sir Tristram, laughing. 'He will never trouble you again.  And, by Our Lady, I wished there had been six of him, for I never felt  more full of fight and strength than I do this day.'    'But--but have ye not claimed the prize?' said La Belle Isoude, and hid  her face that was so deathly white.    'Nay, nor will I,' said Sir Tristram, 'for I crave not to be married. I  would be free and go forth into strange lands to seek adventures.'    He went from her, with the tune of a hunting song upon his lips, and  saw not how La Belle Isoude trembled against the wall and was near to  swoon.    For La Belle Isoude herself was the Lady of the Laundes who should be  given to the victor, though this was known to none but herself and the  king and queen.    The king and queen and all the court marvelled who should be the  stranger knight, and why he had departed, and some suspected Sir  Tristram, but none knew of this except La Belle Isoude and Governale  his squire, and none dared charge him therewith. La Belle Isoude kept  her counsel, and strove to seem lighthearted.    It fell upon a day that Sir Tristram was disporting himself with other  knights at a game of ball upon the green before the castle, and had  left his sword hung upon the post beside his seat in hall. The queen,  with La Belle Isoude, passed through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22397"],[0,"Shakespearean Playhouses (#19)"],[1,"of July, 1606, the youths of Paul's, commonly called the Children of  Paul's, played before the two Kings [of England and of Denmark] a play  called _Abuses_, containing both a comedy and a tragedy, at which the  Kings seemed to take great delight and be much pleased.\"[174]    [Footnote 174: Nichols, _The Progresses of James_, IV, 1073.]    The reason why the Children ceased to act is made clear in the lawsuit  of Keysar _v._ Burbage _et al._, recently discovered and printed by  Mr. Wallace.[175] From this we learn that when Rosseter became manager  of the Children of the Queen's Revels at the private playhouse of  Whitefriars in 1609, he undertook to increase his profits by securing  a monopoly both of child-acting and of private theatres. Blackfriars  had been deserted, and the only other private theatre then in  existence was Paul's. So Rosseter agreed to pay Pierce a dead rent of  L20 a year to keep the Paul's playhouse closed:         One Mr. Rosseter, a partner of the said complainant, dealt       for and compounded with the said Mr. Pierce to the only       benefit of him, the said Mr. Rosseter, the now complainant,       the rest of their partners and Company [at the Whitefriars]       ... that thereby they might ... advance their gains and       profit to be had and made in their said house in the       Whitefriars, that there might be a cessation of playing and       plays to be acted in the said house near St. Paul's Church       aforesaid, for which the said Rosseter compounded with the       said Pierce to give him the said Pierce twenty pounds per       annum.[176]    [Footnote 175: _Shakespeare and his London Associates_, p. 80.]    [Footnote 176: _Ibid._, p. 95.]    In this attempt to secure a monopoly in private playhouses Rosseter  was foiled by the coming of Shakespeare's troupe to the Blackfriars;  but the King's Men readily agreed to join in the payment of the dead  rent to Pierce, for it was to their advantage also to eliminate  competition.    The agreement which Rosseter secured from Pierce was binding \"for one  whole year\"; whether it was renewed we do not know, but the Children  never again acted in \"their house near St. Paul's Church.\"          CHAPTER VII    THE BANKSIDE AND THE BEAR GARDEN      From time out of mind the suburb of London known as \"the  Bankside\"--the term was loosely applied to all the region south of the  river and west of the bridge--had been identified with sports and  pastimes. On Sundays, holidays, and other festive occasions, the  citizens, their wives, and their apprentices were accustomed to seek  outdoor entertainment across the river, going thither in boats (of  which there was an incredible number, converting \"the silver sliding  Thames\" almost into a Venetian Grand Canal), or strolling on foot over  old London Bridge. On the Bankside the visitors could find maypoles  for dancing, butts for the practice of archery, and broad fields for  athletic games; or, if so disposed, they could visit bull-baitings,  bear-baitings, fairs, stage-plays, shows, motions, and other  amusements of a similar sort.    Not all the attractions of the Bankside, however, were so innocent.  For here, in a long row bordering the river's edge, were situated the  famous stews of the city, licensed by authority of the Bishop of  Winchester; and along with the stews, of course, such places as thrive  in a district devoted to vice--houses for gambling, for  coney-catching, and for evil practices of various sorts. The less said  of this feature of the Bankside the better.    More needs to be said of the bull- and bear-baiting, which probably  constituted the chief amusement of the crowds from the city, and which  was later closely associated with the drama and with playhouses. This  sport, now surviving in the bull-fights of Spain and of certain  Spanish-American countries, was in former times one of the most  popular species of entertainment cultivated by the English. Even so  early as 1174, William Fitz-Stephen, in his _Descriptio Nobilissimae  Ciuitatis Londoniae_, under the heading _De Ludis_, records that the  London citizens diverted themselves on holiday occasions with the  baiting of beasts, when \"strong horn-goring bulls, or immense bears,  contend fiercely with dogs that are pitted against them.\"[177] In some  towns the law required that bulls intended for the butcher-shop should  first be baited for the amusement of the public before being led to  the slaughter-house. Erasmus speaks of the \"many herds of bears\" which  he saw in England \"maintained for the purpose of baiting.\" The baiting  was accomplished by tying the bulls or bears to stakes, or when  possible releasing them in an amphitheatre, and pitting against them  bull-dogs, bred through centuries for strength and ferocity.  Occasionally other animals, as ponies and apes, were brought into the  fight, and the sport was varied in miscellaneous ways. Some of the  animals, by unusual courage or success, endeared themselves to the  heart of the sporting public. Harry Hunks, George Stone, and Sacarson  were famous bears in Shakespeare's time; and the names of many of the  \"game bulls\" and \"mastiff dogs\" became household words throughout  London.    [Footnote 177: \"Pingues tauri cornupetae, seu vrsi immanes, cum  obiectis depugnant canibus.\"]    [Illustration: THE BANKSIDE    Showing the Bear- and Bull-baiting Rings. (From the _Map of London_ by  Braun and Hogenbergius, representing the city in 1554-1558.)]    [Illustration: THE BANKSIDE    This was the second district of London used for public playhouses.  Notice the amphitheatres for animal-baiting. (From William Smith's MS.  of the Description of England, _c._ 1580.)]    The home of this popular sport was the Bankside. The earliest extant  map of Southwark,[178] drawn about 1542, shows in the very centre of  High Street, just opposite London Bridge, a circular amphitheatre  marked \"The Bull Ring\"; and doubtless there were other places along  the river devoted to the same purpose. The baiting of bears was more  closely identified with the Manor of Paris Garden,[179] that section  of the Bank lying to the west of the Clink, over towards the marshes  of Lambeth. The association of bear-baiting with this particular  section was probably due to the fact that in early days the butchers  of London used a part of the Manor of Paris Garden for the disposal  of their offal,[180] and the entrails and other refuse from the  slaughtered beasts furnished cheap and abundant food for the bears and  dogs. The Earl of Manchester wrote to the Lord Mayor and the Common  Council, in 1664, that he had been informed by the master of His  Majesty's Game of Bears and Bulls, and others, that \"the Butcher's  Company had formerly caused all their offal in Eastcheap and Newgate  Market to be conveyed by the beadle of the Company unto two barrow  houses, conveniently placed on the river side, for the provision and  feeding of the King's Game of Bears.\"    [Footnote 178: The map is reproduced in facsimile by Rendle as a  frontispiece to _Old Southwark and its People_.]    [Footnote 179: Or Parish Garden, possibly the more correct form. For  the early history of the Manor see William Bray, _The History and  Antiquities of the County of Surrey_, III, 530; Wallace, in _Englische  Studien_ (1911), XLIII, 341, note 3; Ordish, _Early London Theatres_,  p. 125.]    [Footnote 180: Blount, in his _Glossographia_ (1681), p. 473, says of  Paris Garden: \"So called from Robert de Paris, who had a house and  garden there in Richard II.'s time; who by proclamation, ordained that  the butchers of London should buy that garden for receipt of their  garbage and entrails of beasts, to the end the city might not be  annoyed thereby.\"]    [Illustration: THE BEAR- AND BULL-BAITING RINGS    These \"rings\" later gave place to the Bear Garden. (From Agas's _Map  of London_, representing the city as it was about 1560.)]    At first, apparently, the baiting of bears was held in open  places,[181] with the bear tied to a stake and the spectators crowding  around, or at best standing on temporary scaffolds. But later,  permanent amphitheatres were provided. In Braun and Hogenberg's _Map  of London_, drawn between 1554 and 1558, and printed in 1572, we find  two well-appointed amphitheatres, with stables and kennels attached,  labeled respectively \"The Bear Baiting\" and \"The Bull Baiting.\" When  these amphitheatres were erected we do not know, but probably they do  not antedate by much the middle of the century.[182]    [Footnote 181: See Gilpin's _Life of Cranmer_ for a description of a  bear-baiting before the King held on or near the river's edge. See  also the proclamation of Henry VIII in 1546 against the stews, which  implies the non-existence of regular amphitheatres.]    [Footnote 182: Sir Sidney Lee (_Shakespeare's England_, II, 428) says  that one of the amphitheatres was erected in 1526. I do not know his  authority; he was apparently misled by one of Rendle's statements.  Neither of the amphitheatres is shown in Wyngaerde's careful _Map of  London_ made about 1530-1540; possibly they are referred to in the  _Diary_ of Henry Machyn under the date of May 26, 1554. The old \"Bull  Ring\" in High Street had then disappeared, and the baiting of bulls  was henceforth more or less closely associated, as was natural, with  the baiting of bears.]    It is to be noted that at this time neither \"The Bull Baiting\" nor  \"The Bear Baiting\" is in the Manor of Paris Garden, but close by in  the Liberty of the Clink. Yet the name \"Paris Garden\" continued to be  used of the animal-baiting place for a century and more. Possibly the  identification of bear-baiting with Paris Garden was of such long  standing that Londoners could not readily adjust themselves to the  change; they at first confused the terms \"Bear Garden\" and \"Paris  Garden,\" and later extended the term \"Paris Garden\" to include that  section of the Clink devoted to the"]]]
