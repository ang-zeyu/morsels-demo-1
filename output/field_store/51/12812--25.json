The point that must be seized, if subsequent things are to  be seen as they are, is that Parliament certainly encouraged, and  Parliament almost certainly obliged, the King to repudiate the people.  For when, after the rejoicing revolutionists had disarmed and were  betrayed, the King urged a humane compromise on the Parliament, the  Parliament furiously refused it. Already Parliament is not merely a  governing body but a governing class. Parliament was as contemptuous of  the peasants in the fourteenth as of the Chartists in the nineteenth  century. This council, first summoned by the king like juries and many  other things, to get from plain men rather reluctant evidence about  taxation, has already become an object of ambition, and is, therefore,  an aristocracy. There is already war, in this case literally to the  knife, between the Commons with a large C and the commons with a small  one. Talking about the knife, it is notable that the murderer of Tyler  was not a mere noble but an elective magistrate of the mercantile  oligarchy of London; though there is probably no truth in the tale that  his blood-stained dagger figures on the arms of the City of London. The  mediaeval Londoners were quite capable of assassinating a man, but not of  sticking so dirty a knife into the neighbourhood of the cross of their  Redeemer, in the place which is really occupied by the sword of St.  Paul.    It is remarked above that Parliament was now an aristocracy, being an  object of ambition. The truth is, perhaps, more subtle than this; but if  ever men yearn to serve on juries we may probably guess that juries are  no longer popular. Anyhow, this must be kept in mind, as against the  opposite idea of the _jus divinum_ or fixed authority, if we would  appreciate the fall of Richard. If the thing which dethroned him was a  rebellion, it was a rebellion of the parliament, of the thing that had  just proved much more pitiless than he towards a rebellion of the  people. But this is not the main point. The point is that by the removal  of Richard, a step above the parliament became possible for the first  time. The transition was tremendous; the crown became an object of  ambition. That which one could snatch another could snatch from him;  that which the House of Lancaster held merely by force the House of York  could take from it by force. The spell of an undethronable thing seated  out of reach was broken, and for three unhappy generations adventurers  strove and stumbled on a stairway slippery with blood, above which was  something new in the mediaeval imagination; an empty throne.    It is obvious that the insecurity of the Lancastrian usurper, largely  because he was a usurper, is the clue to many things, some of which we  should now call good, some bad, all of which we should probably call  good or bad with the excessive facility with which we dismiss distant  things. It led the Lancastrian House to lean on Parliament, which was  the mixed matter we have already seen. It may have been in some ways  good for the monarchy, to be checked and challenged by an institution  which at least kept something of the old freshness and freedom of  speech. It was almost certainly bad for the parliament, making it yet  more the ally of the mere ambitious noble, of which we shall see much  later. It also led the Lancastrian House to lean on patriotism, which  was perhaps more popular; to make English the tongue of the court for  the first time, and to reopen the French wars with the fine flag-waving  of Agincourt. It led it again to lean on the Church, or rather, perhaps,  on the higher clergy, and that in the least worthy aspect of  clericalism. A certain morbidity which more and more darkened the end of  mediaevalism showed itself in new and more careful cruelties against the  last crop of heresies. A slight knowledge of the philosophy of these  heresies will lend little support to the notion that they were in  themselves prophetic of the Reformation. It is hard to see how anybody  can call Wycliffe a Protestant unless he calls Palagius or Arius a  Protestant; and if John Ball was a Reformer, Latimer was not a Reformer.  But though the new heresies did not even hint at the beginning of  English Protestantism, they did, perhaps, hint at the end of English  Catholicism. Cobham did not light a candle to be handed on to  Nonconformist chapels; but Arundel did light a torch, and put it to his  own church. Such real unpopularity as did in time attach to the old  religious system, and which afterwards became a true national tradition  against Mary, was doubtless started by the diseased energy of these  fifteenth-century bishops. Persecution can be a philosophy, and a  defensible philosophy, but with some of these men persecution was rather  a perversion. Across the channel, one of them was presiding at the trial  of Joan of Arc.    But this perversion, this diseased energy, is the power in all the epoch  that follows the fall of Richard II., and especially in those feuds that  found so ironic an imagery in English roses--and thorns. The  foreshortening of such a backward glance as this book can alone claim to  be, forbids any entrance into the military mazes of the wars of York and  Lancaster, or any attempt to follow the thrilling recoveries and  revenges which filled the lives of Warwick the Kingmaker and the warlike  widow of Henry V. The rivals were not, indeed, as is sometimes  exaggeratively implied, fighting for nothing, or even (like the lion and  the unicorn) merely fighting for the crown. The shadow of a moral  difference can still be traced even in that stormy twilight of a heroic  time. But when we have said that Lancaster stood, on the whole, for the  new notion of a king propped by parliaments and powerful bishops, and  York, on the whole, for the remains of the older idea of a king who  permits nothing to come between him and his people, we have said  everything of permanent political interest that could be traced by  counting all the bows of Barnet or all the lances of Tewkesbury. But  this truth, that there was something which can only vaguely be called  Tory about the Yorkists, has at least one interest, that it lends a  justifiable romance to the last and most remarkable figure of the  fighting House of York, with whose fall the Wars of the Roses ended.    If we desire at all to catch the strange colours of the sunset of the  Middle Ages, to see what had changed yet not wholly killed chivalry,  there is no better study than the riddle of Richard III. Of course,  scarcely a line of him was like the caricature with which his much  meaner successor placarded the world when he was dead. He was not even a  hunchback; he had one shoulder slightly higher than the other, probably  the effect of his furious swordsmanship on a naturally slender and  sensitive frame. Yet his soul, if not his body, haunts us somehow as the  crooked shadow of a straight knight of better days. He was not an ogre  shedding rivers of blood; some of the men he executed deserved it as  much as any men of that wicked time; and even the tale of his murdered  nephews is not certain, and is told by those who also tell us he was  born with tusks and was originally covered with hair. Yet a crimson  cloud cannot be dispelled from his memory, and, so tainted is the very  air of that time with carnage, that we cannot say he was incapable even  of the things of which he may have been innocent. Whether or no he was a  good man, he was apparently a good king and even a popular one; yet we  think of him vaguely, and not, I fancy, untruly, as on sufferance. He  anticipated the Renascence in an abnormal enthusiasm for art and music,  and he seems to have held to the old paths of religion and charity. He  did not pluck perpetually at his sword and dagger because his only  pleasure was in cutting throats; he probably did it because he was  nervous. It was the age of our first portrait-painting, and a fine  contemporary portrait of him throws a more plausible light on this  particular detail. For it shows him touching, and probably twisting, a  ring on his finger, the very act of a high-strung personality who would  also fidget with a dagger. And in his face, as there painted, we can  study all that has made it worth while to pause so long upon his name;  an atmosphere very different from everything before and after. The face  has a remarkable intellectual beauty; but there is something else on the  face that is hardly in itself either good or evil, and that thing is  death; the death of an epoch, the death of a great civilization, the  death of something which once sang to the sun in the canticle of St.  Francis and sailed to the ends of the earth in the ships of the First  Crusade, but which in peace wearied and turned its weapons inwards,  wounded its own brethren, broke its own loyalties, gambled for the  crown, and grew feverish even about the creed, and has this one grace  among its dying virtues, that its valour is the last to die.    But whatever else may have been bad or good about Richard of Gloucester,  there was a touch about him which makes him truly the last of the  mediaeval kings. It is expressed in the one word which he cried aloud as  he struck down foe after foe in the last charge at Bosworth--treason.  For him, as for the first Norman kings, treason was the same as  treachery; and in this case at least it was the same as treachery. When  his nobles deserted him before the battle, he did not regard it as a new  political combination, but as the sin of false friends and faithless  servants. Using his own voice like the trumpet of a herald, he  challenged his rival to a fight as personal as that of two paladins of  Charlemagne. His rival did not reply, and was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#19)"],[1,"really  TALK of them?\"    \"I could meet this with a confidence! They say things that, if we heard  them, would simply appall us.\"    \"And if she IS there--\"    \"Yes?\"    \"Then Miss Jessel is?\"    \"Beyond a doubt. You shall see.\"    \"Oh, thank you!\" my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I  went straight on without her. By the time I reached the pool, however,  she was close behind me, and I knew that, whatever, to her apprehension,  might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as her least  danger. She exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in sight of the  greater part of the water without a sight of the child. There was no  trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of  her had been most startling, and none on the opposite edge, where, save  for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came down to the water.  The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant compared to its length  that, with its ends out of view, it might have been taken for a scant  river. We looked at the empty expanse, and then I felt the suggestion  of my friend's eyes. I knew what she meant and I replied with a negative  headshake.    \"No, no; wait! She has taken the boat.\"    My companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across  the lake. \"Then where is it?\"    \"Our not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. She has used it to go  over, and then has managed to hide it.\"    \"All alone--that child?\"    \"She's not alone, and at such times she's not a child: she's an old,  old woman.\" I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose took again,  into the queer element I offered her, one of her plunges of submission;  then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a small refuge  formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation masked, for  the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump of trees  growing close to the water.    \"But if the boat's there, where on earth's SHE?\" my colleague anxiously  asked.    \"That's exactly what we must learn.\" And I started to walk further.    \"By going all the way round?\"    \"Certainly, far as it is. It will take us but ten minutes, but it's  far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight  over.\"    \"Laws!\" cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too  much for her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got  halfway round--a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by  a path choked with overgrowth--I paused to give her breath. I sustained  her with a grateful arm, assuring her that she might hugely help me; and  this started us afresh, so that in the course of but few minutes more we  reached a point from which we found the boat to be where I had supposed  it. It had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight and  was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just there, down to  the brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking. I recognized,  as I looked at the pair of short, thick oars, quite safely drawn up, the  prodigious character of the feat for a little girl; but I had lived, by  this time, too long among wonders and had panted to too many livelier  measures. There was a gate in the fence, through which we passed, and  that brought us, after a trifling interval, more into the open. Then,  \"There she is!\" we both exclaimed at once.    Flora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as if  her performance was now complete. The next thing she did, however, was  to stoop straight down and pluck--quite as if it were all she was there  for--a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became sure she  had just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself taking a  step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently  approached her. She smiled and smiled, and we met; but it was all done  in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. Mrs. Grose was the first  to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the  child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,  yielding body. While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only watch  it--which I did the more intently when I saw Flora's face peep at me  over our companion's shoulder. It was serious now--the flicker had left  it; but it strengthened the pang with which I at that moment envied Mrs.  Grose the simplicity of HER relation. Still, all this while, nothing  more passed between us save that Flora had let her foolish fern again  drop to the ground. What she and I had virtually said to each other was  that pretexts were useless now. When Mrs. Grose finally got up she kept  the child's hand, so that the two were still before me; and the singular  reticence of our communion was even more marked in the frank look she  launched me. \"I'll be hanged,\" it said, \"if _I_'ll speak!\"    It was Flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first.  She was struck with our bareheaded aspect. \"Why, where are your things?\"    \"Where yours are, my dear!\" I promptly returned.    She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an  answer quite sufficient. \"And where's Miles?\" she went on.    There was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me:  these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn  blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had  held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, I felt  overflow in a deluge. \"I'll tell you if you'll tell ME--\" I heard myself  say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.    \"Well, what?\"    Mrs. Grose's suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and I  brought the thing out handsomely. \"Where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?\"          XX      Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the whole thing was upon us. Much  as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us,  been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child's face now  received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a  pane of glass. It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow,  that Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence--the  shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a  few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized my colleague's  arm. \"She's there, she's there!\"    Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had  stood the other time, and I remember, strangely, as the first feeling  now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. She  was there, and I was justified; she was there, and I was neither cruel  nor mad. She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there  most for Flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so  extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out to her--with  the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and  understand it--an inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on  the spot my friend and I had lately quitted, and there was not, in all  the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. This  first vividness of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds,  during which Mrs. Grose's dazed blink across to where I pointed struck  me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carried my  own eyes precipitately to the child. The revelation then of the manner  in which Flora was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it  would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay  was of course not what I had expected. Prepared and on her guard as our  pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and I  was therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first glimpse of the particular  one for which I had not allowed. To see her, without a convulsion of  her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the direction of the  prodigy I announced, but only, instead of that, turn at ME an expression  of hard, still gravity, an expression absolutely new and unprecedented  and that appeared to read and accuse and judge me--this was a stroke  that somehow converted the little girl herself into the very presence  that could make me quail. I quailed even though my certitude that  she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that instant, and in the  immediate need to defend myself I called it passionately to witness.  \"She's there, you little unhappy thing--there, there, THERE, and you see  her as well as you see me!\" I had said shortly before to Mrs. Grose  that she was not at these times a child, but an old, old woman, and that  description of her could not have been more strikingly confirmed than in  the way in which, for all answer to this, she simply showed me, without  a concession, an admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and  deeper, of indeed suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. I was by this  time--if I can put the whole thing at all together--more appalled at  what I may properly call her manner than at anything else, though it was  simultaneously with this that I became aware of having Mrs. Grose  also, and very formidably, to reckon with. My elder companion, the next  moment, at any rate, blotted out everything but her own flushed face and  her loud, shocked protest, a burst of high disapproval. \"What a dreadful  turn, to be sure, miss! Where on earth do you see anything?\"    I could only grasp her more quickly yet, for even while she spoke the  hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted. It had already  lasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague,  quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my  pointing hand. \"You don't see her exactly as WE see?--you mean to say  you don't now--NOW? She's as big as a blazing fire! Only look, dearest  woman, LOOK--!\" She looked, even as I did, and gave me, with her deep  groan of negation,"]]]
