Like them, too, it is but  a tardy dryer in oil unless thoroughly edulcorated, and does not work in  water with the entire fulness and facility of cochineal pigments. When,  therefore, permanence is of no consideration, the latter may still be  preferred. In those works, however, where the hues and tints of nature  are to be imitated with stability and pure effect, the rose colours of  madder are become indispensable. They have this advantage, moreover,  that they possess the property of ultramarine of improving in hue by  time--their tendency being to their own specific prismatic red colour.  As they are too beautiful and require saddening for the general use of  the painter, the addition of manganese brown, cappagh brown, or burnt  umber, adds to their powers, and improves their drying in oils; for  which last purpose a little japanner's gold size may be likewise  employed.    In the light touches of bright clouds or mountains, where a mixture of  cadmium yellow and Chinese white is used, rose madder is invaluable for  glazing over such touches when dry, should they be required of a warmer  hue. The red portion of sunset skies may be improved by a thin wash of  this pigment, tinged perhaps with the above yellow, or with gamboge.  Most serviceable landscape tints are afforded by admixture of rose  madder with cobalt, Indian red, purple madder, yellow ochre, lamp black,  &c. In painting flesh, the lake cannot be dispensed with.    79. PINK MADDER    Was a weaker preparation of the preceding, paler in hue and possessing  less colour. It was formerly employed in miniature painting, but with  the decline of that art became less and less used, until it may now be  said to be obsolete. The name, however, still lives, but is applied to  rose madder, which is indeed indifferently called _Rose Madder_, _Pink  Madder_, or _Madder Lake_. Speaking of pink roses, Mrs. Duffield remarks  that \"the local colour is best imitated with pink madder,\" and the  Messrs. Rowbotham observe \"this heather may be best represented by  cobalt and madder lake.\" In trade catalogues several names are often  given, as in this instance, to one and the same pigment. The seeming  superfluity is rendered necessary through some artists knowing a pigment  by one name and some by another. Hence arises the value of a list of  synonyms.    80. LIQUID RUBIATE,    _Rose Rubiate_, or _Liquid Madder Lake_, is a concentrated tincture of  madder of the most beautiful and perfect rose colour and transparency.  It is used as a water colour only in its simple state, diluted with  water, and with or without gum. In oil it dries by acting as a  siccative. Mixed or ground with all other madder colours, with or  without gum, it forms combinations which work freely in water, and  produce the most charming and stable effects. The rubiate also furnishes  a fine red ink, and is a durable stain for printing on cotton, &c. To  the tinting of maps and charts permanently, it is peculiarly suited.    81. MARS RED    Or _Rouge de Mars_, is an artificial iron ochre, similar in subdued tint  and permanence to the native earths. Its chemical affinities, however,  are greater than those of the latter, and it therefore requires to be  employed cautiously with pigments affected by iron. In this respect the  red resembles its compeers, Mars yellow, Mars orange, Mars violet, and  Mars brown, all of which are iron ochres artificially prepared.  Possessing the richness and depth of Indian red, it is distinguished by  the russet-orange hue of light red. Its pale washes are marked by  considerable clearness. In keeping the Mars colours separate from the  ochres, we have followed the plan of the author.      OCHRES    Comprise _Red Ochre_, _Indian Red_, _Light Red_, _Venetian Red_,  _English Red_, _Persian Red_, _Prussian Red_, _Spanish Red_, _Brown  Red_, _Indian Ochre_, _Scarlet Ochre_, _Carnagione_, _Terra Puzzoli_,  _English Vermilion_, _Spanish Brown_, _Majolica_, _Redding_, _Ruddle_,  _Bole_, _Almagra_, _Sil Atticum_, _Terra Sinopica_, &c. They are rather  hues and tints than definite colours, or more properly belong to the  tertiary, semi-neutral, and broken colours. As a rule they are native  pigments, found in most countries, and very abundantly and fine in our  own; but some are products of manufacture, and obtainable in the variety  of nature by art.    The colouring matter of these earths is the red oxide of iron, as that  of the yellow ochres is the yellow oxide. All the yellow ochres are more  or less reddened by being burnt, as yellow oxide of iron itself becomes  red on calcination. It was observed in the fourth chapter that time has  often the effect of fire, more or less intense; and hence it is that  yellow ochres occasionally assume a buffish-red hue, by the gradual  peroxidation of the iron. Similarly, if a yellow ochre be but partially  calcined, the red so obtained is apt to deepen or darken. Especially do  these changes take place when the iron oxides are not associated with an  earthy base; when, in fact, the so-called ochres cannot be classed as  such. In this case, too, as was lately remarked, the pigments are more  chemically active, and more likely to affect those colours to which iron  is inimical.    82. RED OCHRE    Is a native earth; sometimes brown ochre burnt, and called _Brown Red_.  It is less pure in hue and clear in its tints than light red, and is  best reserved for dark and vigorous shades and touches. For draperies of  a dusky red it is well suited, or even for the shadows of bright-red  drapery. In dead colouring it is very valuable. Like all ochres, it is  characterized by permanence in water, oil, crayons, and fresco; and is,  like most of them, available in enamel-painting.    Almagra, the Sil Atticum of the ancients, is a deep red ochre found in  Andalusia; as is also their Terra Sinopica or Armenian Bole, dug  originally in Cappadocia, and now found in New Jersey and elsewhere  under the name of Bloodstone.    83. INDIAN RED,    Once known as _Persian Red_, is brought from Bengal. It is a natural  earth rich in peroxide of iron, of a purple russet hue and good body,  and valued when fine for the clearness and soft lakey tone of its tints.  In a crude state it is a coarse powder, full of extremely hard and  brilliant particles of a dark appearance and sometimes magnetic. It is  greatly improved by grinding and washing over, and is very permanent.  Neither light, impure air, mixture with other colours, time, nor fire,  effects any sensible change in it; but being opaque and not keeping its  place well, it is unsuited for glazing. This pigment differs  considerably in its hues, that which is most rosy being esteemed the  best, and affording the purest tints. Inferior ochres were formerly  substituted for Indian red, which procured it a variable character; but  the colour being now obtained abundantly can in general be had genuine.  It is a good drier.    Mixed with Indian ink, it furnishes useful shadows; and compounded with  cobalt or indigo, most serviceable grays. For sunsets, where deep purple  lines are louring over the horizon's brink, a mixture of French blue  with a little Indian red and lake is admirably adapted. In twilight and  stormy clouds, in sails and buildings, in shade carnations of portraits  and backgrounds, &c., the red is often employed.    84. LIGHT RED    Is an ochre of an orange-russet hue, chiefly valued for its tints. The  principal yellow ochres afford this colour best, and the brighter and  clearer the yellow ochre is from which it is prepared, the brighter will  the red be, and the better flesh tints will it yield with white. Light  red has the good properties common to ochres, dries capitally, and  furnishes an excellent crayon. It is much used both in figure and  landscape painting, giving fine grays with cobalt, and serviceable  compounds with yellow ochre, indigo, lamp black, rose madder, Payne's  grey, brown madder, &c.    Terra Puzzoli, a volcanic production, is a species of light red, as is  the Carnagione of the Italians.    85. VENETIAN RED,    Less known as _English Red_, _Prussian Red_, and _Scarlet Ochre_. True  Venetian red, that is, the red of the Venetians, was probably brought  from India, and similar to our modern Indian red. The Venetian red of  the present day, however, is an artificial product, containing no earthy  base, and therefore improperly classed among the ochres. It is prepared  by calcining sulphate of iron, to which a little nitre may be  advantageously added. The result is a peroxide of iron, resembling light  red, but more powerful, and of a more scarlet hue. It is very permanent,  but being a purely iron pigment, should be cautiously employed with  colours affected by that metal. Though not bright, its tints are clear,  and it mixes and works kindly with cobalt or French blue, affording fine  pearly grays. Heightened by madder lake, it furnishes a glowing red,  very useful in some descriptions of skies; and saddened by black, it  gives low toned reds of good quality for buildings. With white it  produces carnation tints nearly approaching to nature, and much employed  by Titian, Vandyke, and others. Compounded with aureolin, Venetian red  yields a clear orange of considerable transparency.    _Spanish Red_ is an ochre differing little from the above.    86. PURE SCARLET,    Or _Iodine Scarlet_, is an iodide of mercury, having the body and  opacity of vermilion, and being as much inferior to it in permanence as  it is superior in brilliancy. Of all artistic pigments, it is at once  the most dazzling and the most fugitive, and should have no place on the  palette. If used, it should be with an ivory knife, as iron and most  metals change it to colours varying from yellow to black; hence it  should never be compounded with metallic pigments. So sensitive, indeed,  is it to the slightest touch of metal, that it has been known to turn to  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#19)"],[1,"the emeers, before him.  Then Bedr Basim judged the people, displaced the tyrannical and invested  the just, and continued to give judgment until near midday, when he rose  from the throne of the kingdom, and went in to his mother, Gulnare of  the Sea, having upon his head the crown, and resembling the moon. So  when his mother saw him, and the king before him, she rose to him and  kissed him, and congratulated him on his elevation to the dignity of  sultan; and she offered up a prayer in favour of him and his father for  length of life, and victory over their enemies. He then sat with his  mother and rested; and when the time of afternoon-prayers arrived, he  rode with the emeers before him until he came to the horse-course, where  he played with arms till the time of nightfall, together with his  father and the lords of his empire; after which he returned to the  palace, with all the people before him. Every day he used to ride to the  horse-course; and when he returned, he sat to judge the people, and  administered justice between the emeer and the poor man. He ceased not  to do thus for a whole year; and after that, he used to ride to the  chase, and go about through the cities and provinces that were under his  rule making proclamation of safety and security, and doing as do the  kings; and he was incomparable among the people of his age in glory and  courage, and in justice to the people.    Now it came to pass that the old king, the father of Bedr Basim, fell  sick one day, whereupon his heart throbbed, and he felt that he was  about to be removed to the mansion of eternity. Then his malady  increased so that he was at the point of death. He therefore summoned  his son, and charged him to take care of his subjects and his mother and  all the lords of his empire and all the dependants. He also made them  swear, and covenanted with them a second time, that they would obey his  son; and he confided in their oaths. And after this he remained a few  days, and was admitted to the mercy of God, whose name be exalted! His  son Bedr Basim, and his wife Gulnare and the emeers and viziers and the  lords of the empire, mourned over him; and they made for him a tomb, and  buried him in it, and continued the ceremonies of mourning for him a  whole month. Saleh, the brother of Gulnare, and her mother, and the  daughters of her uncle, also came, and consoled them for the loss of the  king; and they said: \"O Gulnare, if the king hath died, he hath left  this ingenuous youth, and he who hath left such as he is hath not died.  This is he who hath not an equal, the crushing lion, and the splendid  moon.\" Then the lords of the empire, and the grandees, went in to the  King Bedr Basim, and said to him: \"O King, there is no harm in mourning  for the king; but mourning becometh not any save women; therefore  trouble not thy heart and ours by mourning for thy father; for he hath  died and left thee, and he who hath left such as thou art hath not  died.\" They proceeded to address him with soft words, and to console  him, and after that they conducted him into the bath; and when he came  forth from the bath, he put on a magnificent suit woven of gold, adorned  with jewels and jacinths, and he put the royal crown upon his head,  seated himself upon the throne of his kingdom, and performed the affairs  of the people, deciding equitably between the strong and the weak, and  exacting for the poor man his due from the emeer; wherefore the people  loved him exceedingly. Thus he continued to do for the space of a whole  year; and after every short period, his family of the sea visited him;  so his life was pleasant, and his eye was cheerful: and he ceased not to  live in this state until he was visited by the terminator of delights  and the separator of companions. This is the end of their story. The  mercy of God be on them all!          THE STORY OF ALADDIN; OR, THE WONDERFUL LAMP      In the capital of one of the large and rich provinces of the kingdom of  China there lived a tailor, named Mustapha, who was so poor that he  could hardly, by his daily labour, maintain himself and his family,  which consisted of a wife and son.    His son, who was called Aladdin, had been brought up in a very careless  and idle manner, and by that means had contracted many vicious habits.  He was obstinate, and disobedient to his father and mother, who, when he  grew up, could not keep him within doors. He was in the habit of going  out early in the morning, and would stay out all day, playing in the  streets with idle children of his own age.    When he was old enough to learn a trade, his father, not being able to  put him out to any other, took him into his own shop, and taught him how  to use his needle: but neither fair words nor the fear of chastisement  were capable of fixing his lively genius. All his father's endeavours to  keep him to his work were in vain; for no sooner was his back turned,  than he was gone for that day. Mustapha chastised him, but Aladdin was  incorrigible, and his father, to his great grief, was forced to abandon  him to his idleness: and was so much troubled at not being able to  reclaim him, that it threw him into a fit of sickness, of which he died  in a few months.    The mother, finding that her son would not follow his father's business,  shut up the shop, sold off the implements of trade, and with the money  she received for them, and what she could get by spinning cotton,  thought to maintain herself and her son.    Aladdin, who was now no longer restrained by the fear of a father, and  who cared so little for his mother that whenever she chid him he would  abuse her, gave himself entirely over to his idle habits, and was never  out of the streets from his companions. This course he followed till he  was fifteen years old, without giving his mind to any useful pursuit, or  the least reflection on what would become of him. In this situation, as  he was one day playing with his vagabond associates, a stranger passing  by stood to observe him.    This stranger was a sorcerer, called the African magician; as he was a  native of Africa, and had been but two days arrived from thence.    The African magician, who was a good physiognomist, observing in  Aladdin's countenance something absolutely necessary for the execution  of the design he was engaged in, inquired artfully about his family, who  he was, and what were his inclinations; and when he had learned all he  desired to know, went up to him, and taking him aside from his comrades,  said: \"Child, was not your father called Mustapha, the tailor?\" \"Yes,  sir,\" answered the boy; \"but he has been dead a long time.\"    At these words, the African magician threw his arms about Aladdin's  neck, and kissed him several times with tears in his eyes. Aladdin, who  observed his tears, asked him what made him weep. \"Alas! my son,\" cried  the African magician with a sigh, \"how can I forbear? I am your uncle;  your worthy father was my own brother. I have been many years abroad,  and now I am come home with the hopes of seeing him, you tell me he is  dead. But it is some relief to my affliction, that I knew you at first  sight, you are so like him.\" Then he asked Aladdin, putting his hand  into his purse, where his mother lived, and as soon as he had informed  him, gave him a handful of small money, saying: \"Go, my son, to your  mother, give my love to her, and tell her that I will visit her  to-morrow, that I may have the satisfaction of seeing where my good  brother lived so long.\"    As soon as the African magician left his newly-adopted nephew, Aladdin  ran to his mother, overjoyed at the money his uncle had given him.  \"Mother,\" said he, \"have I an uncle?\" \"No, child,\" replied his mother,  \"you have no uncle by your father's side, or mine.\" \"I am just now  come,\" said Aladdin, \"from a man who says he is my uncle on my father's  side. He cried and kissed me when I told him my father was dead; and to  show you that what I tell you is truth,\" added he, pulling out the  money, \"see what he has given me; he charged me to give his love to you,  and to tell you that to-morrow he will come and pay you a visit, that he  may see the house my father lived and died in.\" \"Indeed, child,\" replied  the mother, \"your father had a brother, but he has been dead a long  time, and I never heard of another.\"    The mother and son talked no more then of the African magician; but the  next day Aladdin's uncle found him playing in another part of the town  with other youths, and embracing him as before, put two pieces of gold  into his hand, and said to him: \"Carry this, child, to your mother, tell  her that I will come and see her to-night, and bid her get us something  for supper; but first show me the house where you live.\"    After Aladdin had showed the African magician the house, he carried the  two pieces of gold to his mother, and when he had told her of his  uncle's intention, she went out and bought provisions. She spent the  whole day in preparing the supper; and at night, when it was ready, said  to her son: \"Perhaps your uncle knows not how to find our house; go and  bring him if you meet with him.\"    Though Aladdin had showed the magician the house, he was ready to go,  when somebody knocked at the door, which he immediately opened; and the  magician came in loaded with wine, and all sorts of fruits, which he  brought for a dessert.    After the African magician had given what he brought into Aladdin's  hands, he saluted his mother, and desired her to shew him the place  where his brother Mustapha used to sit on the sofa; and when she had so  done, he fell down and kissed it several times, crying out with tears in  his eyes: \"My poor brother! how unhappy am I, not to have come soon  enough to give you one last embrace.\" Aladdin's mother desired him to  sit down in the same place, but he declined. \"No,\" said he, \"but give me  leave to sit opposite, that although I am deprived of"]]]
