It was lik'd and  agreed to, and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we  could best spare. The number was not so great as we expected; and tho'  they had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for want  of due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was  separated, and each took his books home again.    And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a  subscription library. I drew up the proposals, got them put into form  by our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in  the Junto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin  with, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company  was to continue. We afterwards obtain'd a charter, the company being  increased to one hundred: this was the mother of all the North  American subscription libraries, now so numerous. It is become a great  thing itself, and continually increasing. These libraries have  improved the general conversation of the Americans, made the common  tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other  countries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so  generally made throughout the colonies in defense of their  privileges.[63]    _Mem deg.._ Thus far was written with the intention express'd in the  beginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no  importance to others. What follows was written many years after in  compliance with the advice contain'd in these letters, and accordingly  intended for the public. The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the  interruption.[64]        [63] Here the first part of the _Autobiography_, written      at Twyford in 1771, ends. The second part, which      follows, was written at Passy in 1784.        [64] After this memorandum, Franklin inserted letters      from Abel James and Benjamin Vaughan, urging him to      continue his _Autobiography_.    [_Continuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris,  1784._]    It is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been  too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain.  It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers,  which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return  being uncertain, and having just now a little leisure, I will  endeavour to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, it  may there be corrected and improv'd.    Not having any copy here of what is already written, I know not  whether an account is given of the means I used to establish the  Philadelphia public library, which, from a small beginning, is now  become so considerable, though I remember to have come down to near  the time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here with  an account of it, which may be struck out if found to have been  already given.    At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good  bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.  In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they  sold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common  school-books. Those who lov'd reading were obliged to send for their  books from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had  left the alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our  club in. I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that  room, where they would not only be ready to consult in our  conferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty  to borrow such as he wish'd to read at home. This was accordingly  done, and for some time contented us.    Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render  the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public  subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would  be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to  put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by  which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first  purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So  few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of  us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more  than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for  this purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum. On  this little fund we began. The books were imported; the library was  opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their  promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. The  institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns,  and in other provinces. The libraries were augmented by donations;  reading became fashionable; and our people, having no publick  amusements to divert their attention from study, became better  acquainted with books, and in a few years were observ'd by strangers  to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same  rank generally are in other countries.    When we were about to sign the above mentioned articles, which were  to be binding on us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden,  the scrivener, said to us, \"You are young men, but it is scarcely  probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term  fix'd in the instrument.\" A number of us, however, are yet living; but  the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that  incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.    The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the  subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's  self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to  raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's  neighbours, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that  project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and  stated it as a scheme of a _number of friends_, who had requested me  to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading.  In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after  practis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can  heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity  will afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to  whom the merit belongs, someone more vain than yourself will be  encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you  justice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to  their right owner.    This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,  for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in  some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended  for me. Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent no  time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in  my business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was  indebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be  educated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who  were established in the place before me. My circumstances, however,  grew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and my  father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently  repeated a proverb of Solomon, \"Seest thou a man diligent in his  calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean  men,\" I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth  and distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I  should ever literally _stand before kings_, which, however, has since  happened; for I have stood before _five_, and even had the honor of  sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.    We have an English proverb that says, \"_He that would thrive, must ask  his wife_.\" It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to  industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me chearfully in my  business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing  old linen rags for the paper-makers, etc., etc. We kept no idle  servants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the  cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time break and milk  (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a  pewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and make a  progress, in spite of principle: being call'd one morning to  breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! They  had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost  her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had  no other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought _her_ husband  deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his  neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in our  house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increas'd,  augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.    I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and though some of  the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the _eternal decrees of God_,  _election_, _reprobation_, _etc._, appeared to me unintelligible,  others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the public  assemblies of the sect, Sunday"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#19)"],[1,"are so saturated with social  suggestions and associations.    THE CONTENT OF THE PERCEPT.--The percept, then, always contains a basis  of _sensation_. The eye, the ear, the skin or some other sense organ  must turn in its supply of sensory material or there can be no percept.  But the percept contains more than just sensations. Consider, for  example, your percept of an automobile flashing past your windows. You  really _see_ but very little of it, yet you _perceive_ it as a very  familiar vehicle. All that your sense organs furnish is a more or less  blurred patch of black of certain size and contour, one or more objects  of somewhat different color whom you know to be passengers, and various  sounds of a whizzing, chugging or roaring nature. Your former experience  with automobiles enables you to associate with these meager sensory  details the upholstered seats, the whirling wheels, the swaying movement  and whatever else belongs to the full meaning of a motor car.    The percept that contained only sensory material, and lacked all memory  elements, ideas and meanings, would be no percept at all. And this is  the reason why a young child cannot see or hear like ourselves. It lacks  the associative material to give significance and meaning to the sensory  elements supplied by the end-organs. The dependence of the percept on  material from past experience is also illustrated in the common  statement that what one gets from an art exhibit or a concert depends on  what he brings to it. He who brings no knowledge, no memory, no images  from other pictures or music will secure but relatively barren percepts,  consisting of little besides the mere sensory elements. Truly, \"to him  that hath shall be given\" in the realm of perception.    THE ACCURACY OF PERCEPTS DEPENDS ON EXPERIENCE.--We must perceive  objects through our motor response to them as well as in terms of  sensations. The boy who has his knowledge of a tennis racket from  looking at one in a store window, or indeed from handling one and  looking it over in his room, can never know a tennis racket as does the  boy who plays with it on the court. Objects get their significance not  alone from their qualities, but even more from their use as related to  our own activities.    Like the child, we must get our knowledge of objects, if we are to get  it well, from the objects themselves at first hand, and not second hand  through descriptions of them by others. The fact that there is so much  of the material world about us that we can never hope to learn it all,  has made it necessary to put down in books many of the things which have  been discovered concerning nature. This necessity has, I fear, led many  away from nature itself to books--away from the living reality of things  to the dead embalming cases of words, in whose empty forms we see so  little of the significance which resides in the things themselves. We  are in danger of being satisfied with the _forms_ of knowledge without  its _substance_--with definitions contained in words instead of in  qualities and uses.    NOT DEFINITIONS, BUT FIRST-HAND CONTACT.--In like manner we come to know  distance, form and size. If we have never become acquainted with a mile  by actually walking a mile, running a mile, riding a bicycle a mile,  driving a horse a mile, or traveling a mile on a train, we might listen  for a long time to someone tell how far a mile is, or state the distance  from Chicago to Denver, without knowing much about it in any way except  word definitions. In order to understand a mile, we must come to know it  in as many ways as possible through sense activities of our own.  Although many children have learned that it is 25,000 miles around the  earth, probably no one who has not encircled the globe has any  reasonably accurate notion just how far this is. For words cannot take  the place of perceptions in giving us knowledge. In the case of shorter  distances, the same rule holds. The eye must be assisted by experience  of the muscles and tendons and joints in actually covering distance, and  learn to associate these sensations with those of the eye before the  eye alone can be able to say, \"That tree is ten rods distant.\" Form and  size are to be learned in the same way. The hands must actually touch  and handle the object, experiencing its hardness or smoothness, the way  this curve and that angle feels, the amount of muscular energy it takes  to pass the hand over this surface and along that line, the eye taking  note all the while, before the eye can tell at a glance that yonder  object is a sphere and that this surface is two feet on the edge.      3. THE PERCEPTION OF SPACE    Many have been the philosophical controversies over the nature of space  and our perception of it. The psychologists have even quarreled  concerning whether we possess an _innate_ sense of space, or whether it  is a product of experience and training. Fortunately, for our present  purpose we shall not need to concern ourselves with either of these  controversies. For our discussion we may accept space for what common  sense understands it to be. As to our sense of space, whatever of this  we may possess at birth, it certainly has to be developed by use and  experience to become of practical value. In the perception of space we  must come to perceive _distance_, _direction_, _size_, and _form_. As a  matter of fact, however, size is but so much distance, and form is but  so much distance in this, that, or the other direction.    THE PERCEIVING OF DISTANCE.--Unquestionably the eye comes to be our  chief dependence in determining distance. Yet the muscle and joint  senses give us our earliest knowledge of distance. The babe reaches for  the moon simply because the eye does not tell it that the moon is out of  reach. Only as the child reaches for its playthings, creeps or walks  after them, and in a thousand ways uses its muscles and joints in  measuring distance, does the perception of distance become dependable.    At the same time the eye is slowly developing its power of judging  distance. But not for several years does visual perception of distance  become in any degree accurate. The eye's perception of distance depends  in part on the sensations arising from the muscles controlling the eye,  probably in part from the adjustment of the lens, and in part from the  retinal image. If one tries to look at the tip of his nose he easily  feels the muscle strain caused by the required angle of adjustment. We  come unconsciously to associate distance with the muscle sensations  arising from the different angles of vision. The part played by the  retinal image in judging distance is easily understood in looking at two  trees, one thirty feet and the other three hundred feet distant. We note  that the nearer tree shows the _detail_ of the bark and leaves, while  the more distant one lacks this detail. The nearer tree also reflects  more _light_ and _color_ than the one farther away. These minute  differences, registered as they are on the retinal image, come to stand  for so much of distance.    The ear also learns to perceive distance through differences in the  quality and the intensity of sound. Auditory perception of distance is,  however, never very accurate.    THE PERCEIVING OF DIRECTION.--The motor senses probably give us our  first perception of direction, as they do of distance. The child has to  reach this way or that way for his rattle; turn the eyes or head so far  in order to see an interesting object; twist the body, crawl or walk to  one side or the other to secure his bottle. In these experiences he is  gaining his first knowledge of direction.    Along with these muscle-joint experiences, the eye is also being  trained. The position of the image on the retina comes to stand for  direction, and the eye finally develops so remarkable a power of  perceiving direction that a picture hung a half inch out of plumb is a  source of annoyance. The ear develops some skill in the perception of  direction, but is less dependable than the eye.      4. THE PERCEPTION OF TIME    The philosophers and psychologists agree little better about our sense  of time than they do about our sense of space. Of this much, however, we  may be certain, our perception of time is subject to development and  training.    NATURE OF THE TIME SENSE.--How we perceive time is not so well  understood as our perception of space. It is evident, however, that our  idea of time is simpler than our idea of space--it has less of content,  less that we can describe. Probably the most fundamental part of our  idea of time is _progression_, or change, without which it is difficult  to think of time at all. The question then becomes, how do we perceive  change, or succession?    If one looks in upon his thought stream he finds that the movement of  consciousness is not uniformly continuous, but that his thought moves in  pulses, or short rushes, so to speak. When we are seeking for some fact  or conclusion, there is a moment of expectancy, or poising, and then the  leap forward to the desired point, or conclusion, from which an  immediate start is taken for the next objective point of our thinking.  It is probable that our sense of the few seconds of passing time that  we call the _immediate present_ consists of the recognition of the  succession of these pulsations of consciousness, together with certain  organic rhythms, such as heart beat and breathing.    NO PERCEPTION OF EMPTY TIME.--Our perception does not therefore act upon  empty time. Time must be filled with a procession of events, whether  these be within our own consciousness or in the objective world without.  All longer periods of time, such as hours, days, or years, are measured  by the events which they contain. Time filled with happenings that  interest and attract us seems short while passing, but longer when  looked back upon. On the other hand, time relatively empty of"]]]
