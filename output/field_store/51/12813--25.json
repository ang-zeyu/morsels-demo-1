Spain, France, and Portugal hold possessions on the       southern continent, as to which I am not well enough informed to       say how far they might meet our views. But either there or in the       northern continent, should the constituted authorities ties of       Virginia fix their attention, of preference, I will have the       dispositions of those powers sounded in the first instance.[115]    Writing to Rufus King in 1802 Jefferson discussed in detail the  feasibility of the plan.         As the expense of so distant a transportation would be very       heavy, and might weigh unfavorably in deciding between the modes       of punishment, it is very desirable that it should be lessened as       much as is practicable. If the regulations of the place would       permit these emigrants to dispose of themselves, as the Germans       and others do who come to this country poor, by giving their       labor for a certain time to some one who will pay their passage;       and if the master of the vessel could be permitted to carry       articles of commerce from this country and take back others from       that, which might yield him a mercantile profit sufficient to       cover the expenses of the voyage, a serious difficulty would be       removed.[116]         The course of things in the ... West Indies appears to have given       a considerable impulse to the minds of the slaves in ... the       United States. A great disposition to insurgency has manifested       itself among them, which, in one instance, in the State of       Virginia, broke out into actual insurrection. This was easily       suppressed; but many of those concerned (between twenty and       thirty, I believe) fell victims to the law. So extensive an       execution could not but excite sensibility in the public mind,       and beget a regret that the laws had not provided for such cases,       some alternative, combining more mildness with equal efficiency.       The Legislature of the State ... took the subject into       consideration, and have communicated to me through the Governor       of the State, their wish that some place could be provided, out       of the limits of the United States, to which slaves guilty of       insurgency might be transported; and they have particularly       looked to Africa as offering the most desirable receptacle. We       might, for this purpose, enter into negotiations with the       natives, on some part of the coast, to obtain a settlement; and,       by establishing an African company, combine with it commercial       operations, which might not only reimburse expenses, but procure       profit also. But there being already such an establishment on       that coast by the English Sierra Leone Company, made for the       express purpose of colonizing civilized blacks to that country,       it would seem better, by incorporating our emigrants with       theirs, to make one strong, rather than two weak colonies. This       would be the more desirable because the blacks settled at Sierra       Leone, having chiefly gone from the States, would often receive       among those whom we should send, their acquaintances and       relatives. The object of this letter is to ask ... you to enter       into conference with such persons, private and public, as would       be necessary to give us permission to send thither the persons       under contemplation.... They are not felons, or common       malefactors, but persons guilty of what the safety of society,       under actual circumstances, obliges us to treat as a crime, but       which their feelings may represent in a far different shape. They       will be a valuable acquisition to the settlement, ... and well       calculated to cooperate in the plan of civilization.         ... The consequences of permitting emancipation to become       extensive, unless a condition of emigration be annexed to them,       furnish matter of solicitude to the Legislature of Virginia.       Although provision for the settlement of emancipated negroes       might perhaps be obtained nearer home than Africa, yet it is       desirable that we should be free to expatriate this description       of people also to the colony of Sierra Leone, if considerations       respecting either themselves or us should render it more       expedient. I pray you, therefore, to get the same permission       extended to the reception of these as well as the (insurgents).       Nor will there be a selection of bad subjects; the emancipations,       for the most part, being either of the whole slaves of the       master, or of such individuals as have particularly deserved       well. The latter are most frequent.[117]      IX    He was firm to the end in his effort to abolish the slave trade.         Whatever may have been the circumstances which influenced our       forefathers to permit the introduction of personal bondage into       any part of these States, and to participate in the wrongs       committed on an unoffending quarter of the globe, we may rejoice       that such circumstances, and such a sense of them, exist no       longer. It is honorable to the nation at large that their       Legislature availed themselves of the first practicable moment       for arresting the progress of this great moral and political       error.[118]         I congratulate you (Congress) on the approach of the period at       which you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to       withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further       participation in those violations of human rights which have been       so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, and       which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our       country, have long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you       may pass can take prohibitory effect till the first day of the       year one thousand eight hundred and eight, yet the intervening       period is not too long to prevent, by timely notice, expeditions       which cannot be completed before that day.[119]--Sixth Annual       Message.      X    In his old age Jefferson became decidedly less radical in his advocacy  of abolition, contenting himself with the utterances of the nature of  an academic deprecation of the evil, expressing the hope that in some  way it might be eradicated, but at the same time despairing of it.  Writing to Edward Coles, he said:         My sentiment on the subject of slavery of negroes have long since       been in possession of the public, and time has only served to       give them stronger root. The love of justice and the love of       country plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a       moral reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in       vain, and should have produced not a single effort, nay I fear       not much serious willingness to relieve them and ourselves from       our present condition of moral and political reprobation.... I       had always hoped that the younger generation receiving their       early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in       every breast, and had become, as it were, the vital spirit of       every American, that the generous temperament of youth, analogous       to the motion of the blood, and above the suggestions of avarice,       would have sympathized with oppression wherever found, and proved       their love of liberty beyond their own share of it. But my       intercourse with them since my return (from Europe) has not been       sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the       progress I had hoped.[120]         The hour of emancipation is advancing, in the march of time. It       will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our       own minds; or by the bloody process of St. Domingo, excited and       conducted by the power of our present enemy (England), if once       stationed permanently within our country, and offering asylum and       arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned       over.[121]         From those of the former generation who were in the fulness of       age when I came into public life, which was while our controversy       with England was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be       hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the       degraded condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate       beings, not reflecting that that degradation was very much the       work of themselves and their fathers, few minds have yet doubted       but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their       horses and cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colonial       life had been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflection on the       value of liberty. And when alarm was taken at an enterprise on       their own, it was not easy to carry them to the whole length of       the principles which they invoked for themselves.[122]         As to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected,       if permitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition       so expedient on the whole, as that of emancipation of those born       after a given day, and of their education and expatriation after       a given age.[123]         I hope you will reconcile yourself to your country and its       unfortunate condition; that you will not lessen its stock of       sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass;       that, on the contrary, you will come forward in the public       councils, become the missionary of this doctrine truly Christian,       insinuate and inculcate it softly but steadily, through the       medium of writing and conversation;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose.

Let it be observed, that when he is seated on the horse's back, he  must first teach the horse to stand quiet, until he has drawn up his  mantle, if necessary, and adjusted the reins, and taken hold of his  lance in such a way as it may most conveniently be carried. Then let  him keep his left arm close to his side; for in such an attitude a  rider appears most graceful and his hand has the greatest power.    As to reins, we approve of such as are equally balanced, and not weak,  or slippery, or too thick, so that the hand which holds them may be  able also to hold the spear when it is necessary.    When the rider gives the signal to the horse to start, let him begin  to advance at a walking pace, as this pace is least likely to disturb  the horse. Let him hold the reins, if the horse be inclined to hold  down his head, rather high, but if he be more disposed to carry it  erect, let him keep them lower, for thus he will best set off the  horse's figure. After a little, if he trot at his natural pace, he  will find his limbs become pliant without inconvenience, and will come  with the greatest readiness to obey the whip. Since too it is the most  approved practise to set off toward the left side, the horse will most  readily start on that side, if, when he lifts, as he is trotting, the  right foot, the rider then give him the signal to gallop. For, being  then about to raise the left foot, he will thus start with that foot;  and just at the moment that the rider turns him to the left, he will  make the first spring in his gallop; for a horse, when he is turned to  the right, naturally leads off with the right foot, and when turned to  the left, with the left foot.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 54: From the treatise, \"On Horsemanship.\" Translated by J.  S. Watson. Mahaffy says this treatise on the horse \"shows an insight  into the character of horses which would do credit to a modern book.\"  Most readers of the treatise who are familiar with horses have  remarked how true it all is of the horse as we know him to-day. One  commentator has remarked that the book reads as if it might have been  written by some educated man professionally attached to racing  stables.]    [Footnote 55: The ancients did not use the stirrup; nor did they have  a saddle in the modern sense of the word.]          PLATO        Born in AEgina of aristocratic parents about 427 B.C.; died       in Athens in 347; originally called Aristocles and surnamed       Plato because of his broad shoulders; a disciple of Socrates       and a teacher of Aristotle; was the founder of the Academic       school; in his youth a successful gymnast, soldier, and       poet; traveled in Egypt, Sicily, and Magna Graecia; arrested       in Syracuse by Dionysius, the tyrant, and sold as a slave in       AEgina, where he was released and returned to Athens;       revisited Syracuse in 367 and 361; lived afterward in Athens       until his death, which occurred at a marriage feast.[56]    I    THE IMAGE OF THE CAVE[57]      After this, I said, imagine the enlightenment or ignorance of our nature  in a figure. Behold: human beings living in a sort of underground den,  which has a mouth open toward the light and reaching all across the den;  they have been here from their childhood, and have their legs and necks  chained so that they can not move, and can see only before them; for the  chains are arranged in such a manner as to prevent them from turning  round their heads. At a distance above and behind them the light of a  fire is blazing, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a  raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the  way, like the screen which marionette-players have before them, over  which they show the puppets.    I see, he[58] said.    And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying vessels,  which appear over the wall; also figures of men and animals, made of  wood and stone and various materials; and some of the passengers, as  you would expect, are talking, and some of them are silent?    That is a strange image, he said, and they are strange prisoners.    Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the  shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of  the cave.    True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they  were never allowed to move their heads?    And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would  see only the shadows.    Yes, he said.    And if they were able to talk to one another, would they not suppose  that they were naming what was actually before them.    Very true.    And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the  other side, would they not be sure to fancy that the voice which they  heard was that of a passing shadow?    No question, he replied.    There can be no question, I said, that the truth would be to them just  nothing but the shadows of the images.    That is certain.    And now look again, and see how they are released and cured of their  folly. At first, when any one of them is liberated and compelled  suddenly to go up and turn his neck round and walk and look at the  light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he  will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he  had seen the shadows; and then imagine some one saying to him that  what he saw before was an illusion, but that now he is approaching  real being and has a truer sight and vision of more real things--what  will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is  pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name  them--will he not be in a difficulty? Will he not fancy that the  shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now  shown to him?    Far truer.    And if he is compelled to look at the light, will he not have a pain  in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the  objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be  clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?    True, he said.    And suppose, once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and  rugged ascent, and held fast and forced into the presence of the sun  himself, do you not think that he will be pained and irritated, and  when he approaches the light he will have his eyes dazzled, and will  not be able to see any of the realities which are now affirmed to be  the truth?    Not all in a moment, he said.    He will require to get accustomed to the sight of the upper world. And  first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and  other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; next he  will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars; and he will see  the sky and the stars by night better than the sun, or the light of  the sun, by day.    Certainly.    And at last he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections  of him in the water, but he will see him as he is in his own proper  place, and not in another; and he will contemplate his nature.    Certainly.    And after this, he will reason that the sun is he who gives the  seasons and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the  visible world, and in a certain way the cause of all things which he  and his fellows have been accustomed to behold....    No question, he said.    This allegory, I said, you may now append to the previous argument;  the prison is the world of sight, the light of the fire is the sun,  the ascent and vision of the things above you may truly regard as the  upward progress of the soul into the intellectual world; that is my  poor belief, to which, at your desire, I have given expression.  Whether I am right or not God only knows; but, whether true or false,  my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears  last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen, is  inferred also to be the universal author of all things beautiful and  right, parent of light and the lord of light in his world, and the  source of truth and reason in the other; this is the first great cause  which he who would act rationally either in public or private life  must behold.    I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.    I should like to have your agreement in another matter I said. For I  would not have you marvel that those who attain to this beatific  vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; but their souls are  ever hastening into the upper world in which they desire to dwell; and  this is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.    Certainly, that is quite natural.    And is there anything surprizing in one who passes from divine  contemplation to human things, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous  manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become  accustomed to the darkness visible, he is compelled to fight in courts  of law, or in other places, about the images or shadows of images of  justice, and is endeavoring to meet the conceptions of those who have  never yet seen the absolute justice?    There is nothing surprizing in that, he replied.    Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of  the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from  coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of  the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who  remembers this when he sees the soul of any one whose vision is  perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask  whether that soul has come out of the brighter life, and is unable to  see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness  to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And then he will count the"]]]
