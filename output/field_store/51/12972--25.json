I knew of it  yesterday, and came now to talk with you of it.\"    \"I rely on you to do me justice.\"    \"_Misericorde!_\" cried the duke, \"would you lose yourself in the eyes  of all France? You would place yourself in a fine situation by declaring  yourself the persecutrix of Voltaire. Only an enemy could have thus  advised you.\"    \"That enemy was comte Jean.\"    \"Then your imprudence equals your zeal. Do you not perceive the  advantage it would give to your adversaries were we to act in this  manner? To the hatred of the court would be united that of the  _literati_, women, and young persons. Voltaire is a god, who is not to  be smitten without sacrilege.\"    \"Must I then tamely submit to be beaten?\"    \"Yes, for the moment. But it will not last long; I have just written  this letter to M. de Voltaire, that peace may be made between you:--    \"SIR,--The superiority of your genius places you amongst the number of  the potentates of Europe. Every one desires, not only to be at peace  with you, but even, if it be possible, to obtain your esteem. I flatter  myself with being included in the ranks of your admirers; my uncle has  spoken to you many times of my attachment to your person, and I embrace  the opportunity of proving this by a means that now presents itself.    \"Persons in whom you place too much confidence have spread abroad, under  your name, copies of a poem, entitled '_La Cour du Roi Petaud._' In  this, wherein insult is cast on a personage who should be exempt from  such offence, is also outraged, in a most indecent way, a lovely female,  whom you would adore as we do, if you had the happiness to know her. Is  it for the poet of the lover of Gabrielle to carry desolation into the  kingdom of the Graces?    \"Your correspondents use you ill by leaving you in ignorance, that this  young person has immense favor here; that we are all at her feet; that  she is all powerful, and her anger is to be particularly avoided. She  is the more to be propitiated, as yesterday, in Presence of a certain  person whom your verses had greatly irritated, she took up your defence  with as much grace as generosity. You see, sir, that you ought not to be  on bad terms with her.    \"My uncle allows me to see, as one of the initiated, what you call your  scraps, which are delicious feasts to us. I read them to the lady in  question, who takes great delight in reciting, or hearing others recite,  your verses, and she begs you will send her some as a proof of your  repentance. Under these circumstances, if your bellicose disposition  urges you on to war, we hope, before you continue it, that you will  loyally and frankly declare it.    \"In conclusion, be assured that I shall defend you to my utmost, and am  for life,    \"Yours, etc.\"    Whilst we were awaiting Voltaire's reply, I determined to avenge myself  on the duchesse de Grammont, who had encouraged him in his attack; and  thus did I serve this lady. Persuaded that she did not know the writing  of his Danish majesty, I wrote the following letter to her:--    \"MADAME LA DUCHESSE,--I have struggled to this time to avoid confessing  to you how I am subdued. Happy should I be could I throw myself at your  feet. My rank alone must excuse my boldness. Nothing would equal my  joy if this evening, at the theatre at madame de Villeroi's, you would  appear with blue feathers in your head-dress. I do not add my name; it  is one of those which should not be found at the bottom of a declaration  of love.\"    In spite of all her penetration, the duchesse de Grammont did not  perceive, in the emphatic tone of this letter, that it was a trick.  Her self-love made her believe that a woman of more than forty could be  pleasing to a king not yet twenty. She actually went in the evening to  madame de Villeroi's dressed in blue, with a blue plumed head-dress. She  was placed next to his Danish majesty. Christian VII addressed her in  most courteous terms, but not one word of love.    The duchesse imagining that the prince was timid, looked at him with  eyes of tenderness, and endeavored to attract and encourage him by all  means she could devise, but the monarch did not understand her. The  duchesse then addressed a few words, which she hoped would lead to  an explanation, but, to her dismay, his majesty did not appear to  understand her. Madame de Grammont was furious at this affair. The duc  d'Aiguillon, who was close to her, had seen all, heard all, and related  particulars to me. The same day I told the king of my trick and  its success. He laughed excessively, and then scolded me for at all  compromising his Danish majesty.    \"How, sire?\" was my reply. \"I did not sign his name; I have not forged  his signature. The vanity of the duchesse has alone caused all the  ridiculous portion of this joke. So much the worse for her if she did  not succeed.\"    I did not, however, limit my revenge to this. A second letter, in  the same hand, was addressed to my luckless enemy. This time she was  informed that she been made a butt of, and mystified. I learned from M.  de Sartines, who, after our compact, gave me details of all, the methods  she had pursued to detect the author of these two epistles, and put  a termination to all these inquiries, by denouncing myself to M. de  Sartines; who then gave such a turn to the whole matter, that the  duchesse could never arrive at the truth.    Voltaire, in the meantime, was not slow in reply; and as I imagine that  you will not be sorry to read his letter, I transcribe it for you:--    \"MONSIEUR LE DUC,--I am a lost, destroyed man. If I had strength enough  to fly, I do not know where I should find courage to take refuge. I!  Good God! I am suspected of having attacked that which, in common with  all France, I respect! When there only remains to me the smallest power  of utterance, but enough to chant a _De profundis,_ that I should employ  it in howling at the most lovely and amiable of females! Believe me,  monsieur le duc, that it is not at the moment when a man is about to  render up his soul, that a man of my good feeling would outrage the  divinity whom he adores. No, I am not the author of the '_Cour du Roi  Petaud._' The verses of this rhapsody are not worth much, it is true;  but indeed they are not mine: they are too miserable, and of too bad a  style. All this vile trash spread abroad in my name, all those pamphlets  without talent, make me lose my senses, and now I have scarcely enough  left to defend myself with. It is on you, monsieur le duc, that I rely;  do not refuse to be the advocate of an unfortunate man unjustly accused.  Condescend to say to this young lady, that I have been before embroiled  with madame de Pompadour, for whom I professed the highest esteem;  tell her, that at the present day especially, the favorite of Caesar is  sacred for me; that my heart and pen are hers, and that I only aspire to  live and die under her banner.    \"As to the scraps you ask for, I have not at this moment any suitable.  Only the best viands are served up at the table of the goddesses. If  I had any I would present them to the person of whom you speak to me.  Assure her, that one day the greatest merit of my verse will be to have  them recited by her lips; and entreat her, until she bestows immortality  on me, to permit me to prostrate myself at her beautiful feet.    \"I will not conclude my letter, monsieur le duc, without thanking you  a thousand times for the advice you have given me. This proof of your  kindness will, if possible augment the sincere attachment I bear to you.  I salute you with profound respect.\"    As it is bold to hold the pen after having transcribed anything of M. de  Voltaire's, I leave off here for to-day.        CHAPTER X           When is the presentation to take place?--Conversation on       this subject with the king--M. de Maupeou and M. de la       Vauguyon--Conversation on the same subject with the king and       the duc de Richelieu--M. de la Vrilliere--M. Bertin---Louis       XV and the comtesse--The king's promise--The fire-works, an       anecdote--The marquise de Castellane--M. de Maupeou at the       duc de Choiseul's--The duchesse de Grammont    In spite of the love of the duchesse de Grammont, the king of Denmark  departed at last. Louis XV having resumed his former habits, I began  to meditate seriously on my presentation; and my friends employed  themselves to the utmost in furthering my desires and insuring my  triumph.    The chancellor, who each day became more attached to my interests,  opened the campaign. One day, when the king was in a rage with the  parliaments, the chancellor seized the opportunity to tell him that  the cabal, who were opposed to my presentation, testified so much  resistance, under the idea, and in the hope, that they would be  supported by the parliaments of Paris.    \"If your majesty,\" added the chancellor, \"had less condescension towards  these malcontents, they would fear your authority more.\"    \"You will see,\" replied the king, \"that it will be their audacity which  will urge me on to a step, which otherwise I should wish to avoid.\"    Whilst the hatred which M. de Maupeou bore towards the parliaments  served me in this way, the love of M. de la Vauguyon for the Jesuits  turned to even more advantage. The good duke incessantly talked to me of  his dear Jesuits; and I as constantly replied, that my influence would  not be salutary until after my presentation, M. de la Vauguyon had  sense enough to perceive the embarrassment of my situation, and saw  that before I could think of others I must think of myself. Having taken  \"sweet counsel\" with the powerful heads of his company, he freely gave  me all his influence with the king.    Fortune sent me an auxiliary not less influential than these two  gentlemen; I mean the marechal duc de Richelieu. In the month of  January, 1769, he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25718"],[0,"The Watchers of the Trails: A Book of Animal Life (#19)"],[1,"of the horrors. If he  called, the flocks came fearlessly, content with his pledge that all  was well. Upon their coming, the fire, and dreadful thunders, and  inexplicable death burst forth from the sedge; and then the great  brown dog appeared to drag his prey to shore. The whole mischief, as  it seemed to him, was the work of the dog; and it did not occur to him  that the man, who seemed fairly well-disposed and all-powerful, had  anything whatever to do with it. This idea gradually grew clear in  the captive's brain, as he swam, very slowly, to and fro upon the  brightening water. In a vague way his heart determined that he would  lure no more of his kindred to their doom. And when, a little later, a  third flock came trumpeting up the sky, the captive eyed their  approach in despairing silence.    As the beating wings drew near, stooping toward the silvery pools and  pale green levels, the captive swam back and forward in wild  excitement, aching to give the call and ease his loneliness. The  flock, perceiving him, drew nearer; but in his excited movements and  his silence its leader discerned a peril. There was something sinister  and incomprehensible in this splendidly marked bird who refused to  summon them to his feeding-ground, and kept swimming wildly back and  forth. Keeping well beyond gunshot, they circled around this smiling  but too mysterious water, to alight with great clamour and splashing  in a little, sheltered mere some two or three hundred yards farther  inland. The hunter, crouching moveless and expectant in his ambush,  muttered an exclamation of surprise, and wondered if it could be  possible that his incomparable decoy had reached an understanding of  the treacherous game and refused to play it.    \"There's no smarter bird that flies than a wild gander!\" he mused,  watching the great bird curiously and with a certain sympathy. \"We'll  see what happens when another flock comes by!\"    Meanwhile the new arrivals, over in the unseen pond behind the rushes,  were feeding and bathing with a happy clamour. They little dreamed  that a pot-hunting rustic from the village on the hills, flat on his  belly in the oozy grass, was noiselessly worming his way toward them.  Armed with an old, single-barrel duck gun, the height of his ambition  was to get a safe and easy shot at the feeding birds. No delicate  wing-shooting for him. What he wanted was the most he could get for  his powder and lead. Big and clumsy though he was, his progress  through the grass was as stealthy as that of a mink.    [Illustration: \"HE LIFTED UP HIS VOICE IN A SUDDEN ABRUPT 'HONK,  HONK!'\"]    It chanced that the path of the pot-hunter took him close past the  further shore of the pond where the captive was straining at his  tether and eating his heart out in determined silence. The homesick,  desolate bird would swim around and around for a few minutes, as a  caged panther circles his bounds, then stop and listen longingly to  the happy noise from over beyond the reed-fringes. At last, goaded  into a moment of forgetfulness by the urge of his desire, he lifted up  his voice in a sudden abrupt _honk, honk_!    The pot-hunter stopped his crawling and peered delightedly through the  sedgy stems. Here was a prize ready to his hand. The flock was still  far off, and might easily take alarm before he could get within range.  But this stray bird, a beauty too, was so near that he could not miss.  Stealthily he brought his heavy weapon to the shoulder; and slowly,  carefully, he took aim.    The report of the big duck gun was like thunder, and roused the  marshes. In a fury the hunter sprang from his ambush across the mere,  and ran down to the water's edge, threatening vengeance on the lout  who would fire on a decoy. The brown retriever, wild with excitement,  dashed barking up and down the shore, not knowing just what he ought  to do. Sandpipers went whistling in every direction. And the foraging  flock, startled from their security, screamed wildly and flapped off  unhurt to remoter regions of the marsh. But the lonely captive, the  wise old gander who had piloted his clan through so many hundred  leagues of trackless air, lay limp and mangled on the stained water,  torn by the heavy charge of the duck gun. The whimsical fate that  seems to play with the destinies of the wild kindreds had chosen to  let him save one flock from the slaughterer, and expiate his blameless  treason.          The Laugh in the Dark      Though the darkness under the great trees was impenetrable, it gave an  impression of transparency which invited the eyes to strain and peer,  as if vision might be expected to reward an adequate effort. It was  that liquid darkness which means not mist, but the utter absence of  light on a clear air; and it was filled with elusive yet almost  illuminating forest scents. To the keen nostrils of the man who was  silently mounting the trail, it seemed as if these wild aromas almost  enabled him to veritably see the trees which towered all about him, so  clearly did they differentiate to him their several species as he  passed,--the hemlock, in particular, and the birch, the black poplar,  and the aromatic balsam-fir. But his eyes, though trained to the open,  could in truth detect nothing whatever, except now and then a darting  gleam which might come from a wet leaf, or from the gaze of a watching  wood-mouse, or merely from the stirrings of the blood within his own  brain.    The man was on his way up from the lake, by an old trail long ago  familiar to his feet, to make camp for the night in a deserted lumber  shanty about a quarter of a mile back from the water. Over the dimly  glimmering, windless water, under a cloudless sky, he had groped his  way in his canoe to the old landing. Turning the canoe over his  supplies for protection in case of rain, he had set out for the lumber  shanty with only a blanket and a couple of hardtack. His rifle he had  indifferently left in the canoe, but in his right hand he carried a  paddle, to steady his steps and help him feel his way through the  dark.    Once the grayness of the open shore had faded behind him, the man  found himself walking stealthily, like the stealthiest of the wild  kindred themselves. The trail being well-worn, though long deserted by  man, his feet kept it without difficulty; but he held the paddle out  before him lest he should stumble over a windfall. Presently he took  note of the fact that the trail was marvellously smooth for one that  had been so long deserted, and with a little creeping of the skin,  which was not in any sense fear but rather an acknowledgment of  mystery, he realized that it was other than human feet which were  keeping the lonely path in use. What kind were they, he wondered,--the  great, noiseless pads of bear, or lynx, or panther, the hard hoofs of  moose or deer, or the airy, swift feet of hare and mink and marten? As  he wondered, moving more and more furtively as the spirit of the  unseen wild pervaded and possessed him, his nostrils discerned across  the savours of the trees and the mould a sudden musky scent; and he  knew that one of the frequenters of the trail was a red fox, who had  just gone by.    Impressed by a sense that he was not so utterly alone as he had  imagined himself to be, the man now obeyed one of the wary impulses of  the wood-folk. He stepped aside from the trail, feeling his way, and  leaned his back against a huge birch-tree. The ragged, ancient,  sweet-smelling bark felt familiar and friendly to his touch. Here he  stood, sniffing the still air with discrimination, testing with  initiated ears every faint forest breathing. The infinitesimal and  incessant stir of growth and change and readjustment was vaguely  audible to his fine sense, making a rhythmic background against which  the slightest unusual sound, even to the squeak of a wood-mouse, or  the falling of a worm-bitten leaf, would have fairly startled the  dark. Once he heard a twig snap, far in the depths on the other side  of the trail, and he knew that some one of the wild kindred had moved  carelessly. But on the trail nothing went by.    Had there been ever so small a glimmer of light, to enable his eyes to  play their part in this forest game, the man could have watched for an  hour as moveless as the tree on which he leaned. But in that strange,  absolute dark the strain soon grew almost intolerable. The game  certainly ceased to be amusing after an uneventful fifteen minutes had  passed. He was just about to give up, to step forth into the trail and  resume his journey to the cabin, when he caught a strange sound, which  made him stiffen back at once into watchful rigidity.    The sound was a great breath. In its suddenness and its vagueness the  listener was unable to distinguish whether it came from a dozen yards  down the trail, or a couple of dozen inches from his elbow. His nose,  however, assured him that he had not the latter alternative to face;  so he waited, his right hand upon the knife in his belt. He could hear  his heart beating.    For several minutes nothing more was heard. Then through the high  leafage overhead splashed a few big drops of rain, with the hushing  sound of a shower not heavy enough to break through. The next moment a  flash of white lightning lit up the forest aisles,--and in that moment  the man saw a huge black bear standing in the trail, not ten feet  distant. In that moment the eyes of the man and the eyes of the beast  met each other fairly. Then the blackness fell once more; and a thin  peal of midsummer thunder rolled over the unseen tree-tops.    When all was silence again the man felt uncomfortable, and regretted  the rifle which he had left under the canoe. That the bear would  attack him, unprovoked, he knew to be improbable; but he also knew  enough about bears to know that it is never well to argue too  confidently as to what they will do. The more he waited and listened,  the"]]]
