Nay, party violence even went the length of  assassination.  Ephialtes, who had taken the lead in the attacks upon  the Areopagus, fell beneath the dagger of a Boeotian, hired by the  conservative party to dispatch him.    It was from this period (B.C. 461) that the long administration of  Pericles may be said to have commenced.  The effects of his accession  to power soon became visible in the foreign relations of Athens.  Pericles had succeeded to the political principles of Themistocles, and  his aim was to render Athens the leading power of Greece.  The  Confederacy of Delos had already secured her maritime ascendency;  Pericles directed his policy to the extension of her influence in  continental Greece.  She formed an alliance with the Thessalians,  Argos, and Megara.  The possession of Megara was of great importance,  as it enabled the Athenians to arrest the progress of an invading army  from Peloponnesus, AEgina, so long the maritime rival of Athens, was  subdued and made tributary.  The Athenians marched with rapid steps to  the dominion of Greece.  Shortly afterwards the battle of OEnophyta  (B.C. 456), in which the Athenians defeated the Boeotians, gave Athens  the command of Thebes, and of all the other Boeotian towns.  From the  gulf of Corinth to the straits of Thermopylae Athenian influence was  now predominant.  During these events the Athenians had continued to  prosecute the war against Persia.  In the year B.C. 460 they sent a  powerful fleet to Egypt to assist Inarus, who had revolted against  Persia; but this expedition proved a complete failure, for at the end  of six years the revolt was put down by the Persians, and the Athenian  fleet destroyed (B.C. 455).  At a later period (B.C. 449) Cimon, who  had been recalled from exile, sailed to Cyprus with a fleet of 200  ships. He undertook the siege of Citium in that island; but died during  the progress of it, either from disease or from the effects of a wound.  Shortly afterwards a pacification was concluded with Persia, which is  sometimes, but erroneously, called \"the peace of Cimon.\"  It is stated  that by this compact the Persian monarch agreed not to tax or molest  the Greek colonies on the coast of Asia Minor, nor to send any vessels  of war westward of Phaselis in Lycia, or within the Cyanean rocks at  the junction of the Euxine with the Thracian Bosporus; the Athenians on  their side undertaking to leave the Persians in undisturbed possession  of Cyprus and Egypt.  During the progress of these events, the states  which formed the Confederacy of Delos, with the exception of Chios,  Lesbos, and Samos, had gradually become, instead of the active allies  of Athens, her disarmed and passive tributaries. Even the custody of  the fund had been transferred from Delos to Athens.  The purpose for  which the confederacy had been originally organised disappeared with  the Persian peace; yet what may now be called Imperial Athens  continued, for her own ends, to exercise her prerogatives as head of  the league.  Her alliances, as we have seen, had likewise been extended  in continental Greece, where they embraced Megara, Boeotia, Phocis,  Locris, together with Troezen and Achaia in Peloponnesus.  Such was the  position of Athens in the year 448 B.C., the period of her greatest  power and prosperity.  From this time her empire began to decline;  whilst Sparta, and other watchful and jealous enemies, stood ever ready  to strike a blow.    In the following year (B.C. 447) a revolution in Boeotia deprived  Athens of her ascendency in that country.  With an overweening contempt  of their enemies, a small band of 1000 Athenian hoplites, chiefly  composed of youthful volunteers belonging to the best Athenian  families, together with a few auxiliaries, marched under the command of  Tolmides to put down the revolt, in direct opposition to the advice of  Pericles, who adjured them to wait and collect a more numerous force.  The enterprise proved disastrous in the extreme.  Tolmides was defeated  and slain near Chaeronea, a large number of the hoplites also fell in  the engagement, while a still larger number were taken prisoners. This  last circumstance proved fatal to the interests of Athens in Boeotia.  In order to recover these prisoners, she agreed to evacuate Boeotia,  and to permit the re-establishment of the aristocracies which she had  formerly overthrown.  But the Athenian reverses did not end here.  The  expulsion of the partisans of Athens from the government of Phocis and  Locris, and the revolt of Euboea and Megara, were announced in quick  succession.  The youthful Pleistoanax, king of Sparta, actually  penetrated, with an army of Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesian allies, as  far as the neighbourhood of Eleusis; and the capital itself, it is  said, was saved only by Pericles having bribed the Spartan monarch.  Pericles reconquered Euboea; but this was the only possession which the  Athenians succeeded in recovering. Their empire on land had vanished  more, speedily than it had been acquired; and they were therefore  induced to conclude, at the beginning of B.C. 445, a THIRTY YEARS'  TRUCE with Sparta and her allies, by which they consented to abandon  all the acquisitions which they had made in Peloponnesus, and to leave  Megara to be included among the Peloponnesian allies of Sparta.    From the Thirty Years' Truce to the commencement of the Peloponnesian  war, few political events of any importance occurred.  During these  fourteen years (B.C. 445-431) Pericles continued to enjoy the sole  direction of affairs.  His views were of the most lofty kind.  Athens  was to become the capital of Greece, and the centre of art and  refinement.  In her external appearance the city was to be rendered  worthy of the high position to which she aspired, by the beauty and  splendour of her public buildings, by her works of art in sculpture,  architecture, and painting, and by the pomp and magnificence of her  religious festivals.  All these objects Athens was enabled to attain in  an incredibly short space of time, through the genius and energy of her  citizens and the vast resources at her command.  No state has ever  exhibited so much intellectual activity and so great a progress in art  as was displayed by Athens in the period which elapsed between the  Thirty Years' Truce and the breaking out of the Peloponnesian war.  She  was the seat and centre of Grecian literature.  The three great tragic  poets of Greece were natives of Attica.  AEschylus, the earliest of the  three, had recently died in Sicily; but Sophocles was now at the full  height of his reputation, and Euripides was rapidly rising into notice.  Aristophanes, the greatest of the Grecian comic poets, was also born in  Attica, and exhibited plays soon after the beginning of the  Peloponnesian war.  Herodotus, the Father of History, though a native  of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor, resided some time at Athens, and  accompanied a colony which the Athenians sent to Thurii in Italy.  Thucydides, the greatest of Greek historians, was an Athenian, and was  a young man at this period.    Colonization, for which the genius and inclination of the Athenians had  always been suited, was another method adopted by Pericles for  extending the influence and empire of Athens.  The settlements made  under his auspices were of two kinds CLERUCHIES, and regular colonies.  The former mode was exclusively Athenian. It consisted in the allotment  of land in conquered or subject countries to certain bodies of  Athenians who continued to retain all their original rights of  citizenship.  This circumstance, as well as the convenience of entering  upon land already in a state of cultivation instead of having to  reclaim it from the rude condition of nature, seems to have rendered  such a mode of settlement much preferred by the Athenians.  The  earliest instance which we find of it is in the year B.C. 506, when  four thousand Athenians entered upon the domains of the Chalcidian  knights (see Ch.5).  But it was under Pericles that this system was  most extensively adopted.  During his administration 1000 Athenian  citizens were settled in the Thracian Chersonese, 500 in Naxos, and 250  in Andros.  The islands of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, as well as a  large tract in the north of Euboea, were also completely occupied by  Athenian proprietors.    The most important colonies settled by Pericles were those of Thurii  and Amphipolis.  Since the destruction of Sybaris by the Crotoniates,  in B.C. 509, the former inhabitants had lived dispersed in the  adjoining territory along the gulf of Tarentum, In B.C. 443 Pericles  sent out a colony to found Thurii, near the site of the ancient  Sybaris.  The colony of Amphipolis was founded some years later (B.C.  437), under the conduct of Agnon.    But Pericles, notwithstanding his influence and power, had still many  bitter and active enemies, who assailed him through his private  connections, and even endeavoured to wound his honour by a charge of  peculation.  Pericles, after divorcing a wife with whom he had lived  unhappily, took his mistress Aspasia to his house, and dwelt with her  till his death on terms of the greatest affection.  She was  distinguished not only for her beauty, but also for her learning and  accomplishments.  Her intimacy with Anaxagoras, the celebrated Ionic  philosopher, was made a handle for wounding Pericles in his tenderest  relations.  Paganism, notwithstanding its licence, was capable of  producing bigots: and even at Athens the man who ventured to dispute  the existence of a hundred gods with morals and passions somewhat worse  than those of ordinary human nature, did so at the risk of his life.  Anaxagoras was indicted for impiety.  Aspasia was included in the same  charge, and dragged before the courts of justice.

With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue  which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly  lost it at the last moment.\"    \"Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\" said she.    I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her  last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the  appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the  wild chase down the Thames.  She listened with parted lips and shining  eyes to my recital of our adventures.  When I spoke of the dart which  had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she  was about to faint.    \"It is nothing,\" she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.  \"I am all right again.  It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed  my friends in such horrible peril.\"    \"That is all over,\" I answered.  \"It was nothing.  I will tell you no  more gloomy details.  Let us turn to something brighter. There is the  treasure.  What could be brighter than that?  I got leave to bring it  with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\"    \"It would be of the greatest interest to me,\" she said.  There was no  eagerness in her voice, however.  It had struck her, doubtless, that it  might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which  had cost so much to win.    \"What a pretty box!\" she said, stooping over it.  \"This is Indian work,  I suppose?\"    \"Yes; it is Benares metal-work.\"    \"And so heavy!\" she exclaimed, trying to raise it.  \"The box alone must  be of some value.  Where is the key?\"    \"Small threw it into the Thames,\" I answered.  \"I must borrow Mrs.  Forrester's poker.\"  There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,  wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha.  Under this I thrust the end  of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open  with a loud snap.  With trembling fingers I flung back the lid.  We  both stood gazing in astonishment.  The box was empty!    No wonder that it was heavy.  The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch  thick all round.  It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest  constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb  of metal or jewelry lay within it.  It was absolutely and completely  empty.    \"The treasure is lost,\" said Miss Morstan, calmly.    As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow  seemed to pass from my soul.  I did not know how this Agra treasure had  weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.  It was  selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save  that the golden barrier was gone from between us.  \"Thank God!\" I  ejaculated from my very heart.    She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile.  \"Why do you say  that?\" she asked.    \"Because you are within my reach again,\" I said, taking her hand. She  did not withdraw it.  \"Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man  loved a woman.  Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips.  Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you.  That is why I  said, 'Thank God.'\"    \"Then I say, 'Thank God,' too,\" she whispered, as I drew her to my  side.  Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained  one.        Chapter XII    The Strange Story of Jonathan Small    A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary  time before I rejoined him.  His face clouded over when I showed him  the empty box.    \"There goes the reward!\" said he, gloomily.  \"Where there is no money  there is no pay.  This night's work would have been worth a tenner each  to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\"    \"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\" I said.  \"He will see that you are  rewarded, treasure or no.\"    The inspector shook his head despondently, however.  \"It's a bad job,\"  he repeated; \"and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\"    His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank  enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They  had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had  changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon  the way.  My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless  expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden  leg cocked over his sound one.  As I exhibited the empty box he leaned  back in his chair and laughed aloud.    \"This is your doing, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, angrily.    \"Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\" he  cried, exultantly.  \"It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot  I'll take darned good care that no one else does.  I tell you that no  living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the  Andaman convict-barracks and myself.  I know now that I cannot have the  use of it, and I know that they cannot.  I have acted all through for  them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us always.  Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and  throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin  of Sholto or of Morstan.  It was not to make them rich that we did for  Achmet.  You'll find the treasure where the key is, and where little  Tonga is.  When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot  away in a safe place.  There are no rupees for you this journey.\"    \"You are deceiving us, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, sternly.  \"If you  had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been  easier for you to have thrown box and all.\"    \"Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\" he answered,  with a shrewd, sidelong look.  \"The man that was clever enough to hunt  me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a  river.  Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a  harder job.  It went to my heart to do it, though.  I was half mad when  you came up with us.  However, there's no good grieving over it.  I've  had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry  over spilled milk.\"    \"This is a very serious matter, Small,\" said the detective.  \"If you  had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have  had a better chance at your trial.\"    \"Justice!\" snarled the ex-convict.  \"A pretty justice!  Whose loot is  this, if it is not ours?  Where is the justice that I should give it up  to those who have never earned it?  Look how I have earned it!  Twenty  long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the  mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten  by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced  policeman who loved to take it out of a white man.  That was how I  earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I  cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may  enjoy it!  I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of  Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that  another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be  mine.\" Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in  a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked  together with the impassioned movement of his hands.  I could  understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was  no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when  he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.    \"You forget that we know nothing of all this,\" said Holmes quietly.  \"We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may  originally have been on your side.\"    \"Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that  I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists.  Still,  I bear no grudge for that.  It is all fair and above-board.  If you  want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you  is God's truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass  beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry.    \"I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore.  I dare say you  would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look.  I  have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that  I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would  be so very glad to see me.  They were all steady, chapel-going folk,  small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I  was always a bit of a rover.  At last, however, when I was about  eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a  girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's shilling  and joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India.    \"I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however.  I had just got past  the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough  to go swimming in the Ganges.  Luckily for me, my company sergeant,  John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the  finest swimmers in the service.  A crocodile took me, just as I was  half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon  could have done it, just above the knee.  What with the shock and the  loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not  caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in  hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with  this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of  the army and unfitted for any active occupation."]]]
