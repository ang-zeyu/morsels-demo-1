There were only two of them, of course, and  they were lying close together, each on its tawny side on the sandy  desert at the edge of the oasis.    Very gently the ropes, with slip knots, were fitted over their heads,  and the other end of the rope passed round a palm tree. Other ropes  round the trees were passed round what would have been the waists of the  lions if lions had such things as waists.    'Now!' whispered Lucy, and at once all four ropes were pulled tight. The  lions struggled, but only in their sleep. And soon they were still. Then  with more and more ropes their legs and tails were made fast.    'And that's all right,' said Lucy, rather out of breath. 'Where's  Polly?'    'Here,' replied that bird from a neighbouring bush. 'I thought I should  only be in the way if I kept close to you. But I longed to lend a claw  in such good work. Can I help _now_?'    'Will you please explain to the dogs?' said Lucy. 'It's their turn now.  The only way I know to kill Noah's Ark lions is to _lick the paint off_  and break their legs. And if the dogs lick all the paint off their legs  they won't feel it when we break them.'    Polly hastened to explain to the dogs, and then turned again to Lucy.    'They asked if you're sure the ropes will hold, and I've told them of  course. So now they're going to begin. I only hope the paint won't make  them ill.'    'It never did me,' said Lucy. 'I sucked the dove quite clean one Sunday,  and it wasn't half bad. Tasted of sugar a little and eucalyptus oil like  they give you when you've got a cold. Tell them that, Polly.'    Polly did, and added, 'I will recite poetry to them to hearten them to  their task.'    'Do,' said Philip heartily, 'it may make them hurry up. But perhaps  you'd better tell them that we shall pinch their tails if they happen to  go to sleep.'    Then the children had a cocoa-and-date breakfast. (All expeditions seem  to live mostly on cocoa, and when they come back they often write to the  cocoa makers to say how good it was and they don't know what they would  have done without it.) And the noble and devoted dogs licked and licked  and licked, and the paint began to come off the lions' legs like  anything. It was heavy work turning the lions over so as to get at the  other or unlicked side, but the expedition worked with a will, and the  lions resisted but feebly, being still asleep, and, besides, weak from  loss of paint. And the dogs had a drink given them and were patted and  praised, and set to work again. And they licked and licked for hours and  hours. And in the end all the paint was off the lions' legs, and Philip  chopped them off with the explorer's axe which that experienced  Provider, Mr. Noah's son, had thoughtfully included in the outfit of the  expedition. And as he chopped the chips flew, and Lucy picked one up,  and it was _wood_, just wood and nothing else, though when they had  tied it up it had been real writhing resisting lion-leg and no mistake.  And when all the legs were chopped off, Philip put his hand on a lion  body, and that was wood too. So the lions were dead indeed.    [Illustration: It was heavy work turning the lions over.]    'It seems a pity,' he said. 'Lions are such jolly beasts when they are  alive.'    'I never cared for lions myself,' said Polly; and Lucy said, 'Never  mind, Phil. It didn't hurt them anyway.'    And that was the first time she ever called him Phil.    'All right, Lu,' said Philip. 'It was jolly clever of you to think of it  anyhow.'    And that was the first time he ever called her Lu.          .       .       .       .       .       .       .    They saw the straight pale line of the sea for a long time before they  came to the place of the Dwellers by the Sea. For these people had built  their castle down on the very edge of the sea, and the Pebbly Waste rose  and rose to a mountain that hid their castle from the eyes of the  camel-riders who were now drawing near to the scene of their next deed.  The Pebbly Waste was all made of small slippery stones, and the children  understood how horrid a horse would have found it. Even the camel  went very slowly, and the dogs no longer frisked and bounded, but  went at a foot's pace with drooping ears and tails.    'I should call a halt, if I were you,' said Polly. 'We shall all be the  better for a cup of cocoa. And besides----'    Polly refused to explain this dark hint and only added, 'Look out for  surprises.'    'I thought,' said Philip, draining the last of his second mug of cocoa,  'I thought there were no birds in the desert except you, and you're more  a person than a bird. But look there.'    Far away across the desert a moving speck showed, high up in the blue  air. It grew bigger and bigger, plainly coming towards the camp. It was  as big as a moth now, now as big as a teacup, now as big as an eagle,  and----    'But it's got four legs,' said Lucy.    'Yes,' said the parrot; 'it would have, you know. It is the Hippogriff.'    It was indeed that magnificent wonder. Flying through the air with long  sweeps of his great white wings, the Hippogriff drew nearer and nearer,  bearing on his back--what?    'It's the Pretenderette,' cried Lucy, and at the same moment Philip  said, 'It's that nasty motor thing.'    It was. The Hippogriff dropped from the sky to the desert below as  softly as a butterfly alighting on a flower, and stood there in all his  gracious whiteness. And on his back was the veiled motor lady.    'So glad I've caught you up,' she said in that hateful voice of hers;  'now we can go on together.'    'I don't see what you wanted to come at all for,' said Philip  downrightly.    'Oh, _don't_ you?' she said, sitting up there on the Hippogriff with her  horrid motor veil fluttering in the breeze from the now hidden sea.  'Why, of course, I have a right to be present at all experiments. There  ought to be some responsible grown-up person to see that you really do  what you're sure to say you've done.'    'Do you mean that we're liars?' Philip asked hotly.    'I don't mean to _say_ anything about it,' the Pretenderette answered  with an unpleasant giggle, 'but a grown-up person ought to be present.'  She added something about a parcel of birds and children. And the parrot  ruffled his feathers till he looked twice his proper size.    Philip said he didn't see it.    'Oh, but _I_ do,' said the Pretenderette; 'if you fail, then it's my  turn, and I might very likely succeed the minute after you'd failed. So  we'll all go on comfortably together. _Won't_ that be nice?'    A speechless despair seemed to have fallen on the party. Nobody spoke.  The children looked blank, the dogs whined, the camel put on his  haughtiest sneer, and the parrot fidgeted in his fluffed-out feather  dress.    'Let's be starting,' said the motor lady. 'Gee-up, pony!' A shiver ran  through every one present. That a Pretenderette should dare to speak so  to a Hippogriff!    Suddenly the parrot spread its wings and flew to perch on Philip's  shoulder. It whispered in his ear.    'Whispering is not manners, I know,' it said, 'but your own generous  heart will excuse me. \"Parcel of birds and children.\" Doesn't your blood  boil?'    Philip thought it did.    'Well, then,' said the bird impatiently, 'what are we waiting for?  You've only got to say the word and I'll take her back by the ear.'    'I wish you would,' said Philip from the heart.    'Nothing easier,' said the parrot, 'the miserable outsider! Intruding  into _our_ expedition! I advise you to await my return here. Or if I am  not back by the morning there will be no objection to your calling,  about noon, on the Dwellers. I can rejoin you there. Good-bye.'    It stroked his ear with a gentle and kindly beak and flew into the air  and circled three times round the detested motor lady's head.    'Get away,' she cried, flapping her hands furiously; 'call your silly  Poll-parrot off, can't you?' And then she screamed, 'Oh! it's got hold  of my ear!'    'Oh, don't hurt her,' said Lucy.    'I will not hurt her;' the parrot let the ear go on purpose to say this,  and the Pretenderette covered both ears with her hands. 'You person in  the veil, I shall take hold again in a moment. And it will hurt you much  less if the Hippogriff and I happen to be flying in the same direction.  See? If I were you I should just say \"Go back the way you came, please,\"  to the Hippogriff, and then I shall hardly hurt you at all. Don't think  of getting off. If you do, the dogs will have you. Keep your hands over  your ears if you like. I know you can hear me well enough. Now I am  going to take hold of you again. Keep your hands where they are. I'm not  particular to an ear or so. A nose will do just as well.'    The person on the Hippogriff put both hands to her nose. Instantly the  parrot had her again by the ear.    'Go back the way you came,' she cried; 'but I'll be even with you  children yet.'    The Hippogriff did not move.    'Let go my ear,' screamed the lady.    'You'll have to say please, you know,' said Philip; 'not to the bird, I  don't mean that: that's no good. But to the Hippogriff.'    '_Please_ then,' said the lady in a burst of temper, and instantly the  white wings parted and spread and the Hippogriff rose in the air. Polly  let the ear go for the moment to say:    'I shan't hurt her so long as she behaves,' and then took hold again and  his little grey wings and the big white wings of the Hippogriff went  sailing away across the desert.    'What a treasure of a parrot?' said Philip. But Lucy said:    'Who _is_ that Pretenderette? Why is she so horrid to us when every one  else is so nice?'    'I don't know,' said Philip, 'hateful old thing.'    'I can't help feeling as if I knew her quite well, if I could only  remember who she is.'    'Do you?' said Philip.

It must however be confessed, that a man, who places honour only in  successful violence, is a very troublesome and pernicious animal in time  of peace; and that the martial character cannot prevail in a whole  people, but by the diminution of all other virtues.  He that is  accustomed to resolve all right into conquest, will have very little  tenderness or equity.  All the friendship in such a life can be only a  confederacy of invasion, or alliance of defence.  The strong must  flourish by force, and the weak subsist by stratagem.    Till the Highlanders lost their ferocity, with their arms, they suffered  from each other all that malignity could dictate, or precipitance could  act.  Every provocation was revenged with blood, and no man that ventured  into a numerous company, by whatever occasion brought together, was sure  of returning without a wound.  If they are now exposed to foreign  hostilities, they may talk of the danger, but can seldom feel it.  If  they are no longer martial, they are no longer quarrelsome.  Misery is  caused for the most part, not by a heavy crush of disaster, but by the  corrosion of less visible evils, which canker enjoyment, and undermine  security.  The visit of an invader is necessarily rare, but domestick  animosities allow no cessation.    The abolition of the local jurisdictions, which had for so many ages been  exercised by the chiefs, has likewise its evil and its good.  The feudal  constitution naturally diffused itself into long ramifications of  subordinate authority.  To this general temper of the government was  added the peculiar form of the country, broken by mountains into many  subdivisions scarcely accessible but to the natives, and guarded by  passes, or perplexed with intricacies, through which national justice  could not find its way.    The power of deciding controversies, and of punishing offences, as some  such power there must always be, was intrusted to the Lairds of the  country, to those whom the people considered as their natural judges.  It  cannot be supposed that a rugged proprietor of the rocks, unprincipled  and unenlightened, was a nice resolver of entangled claims, or very exact  in proportioning punishment to offences.  But the more he indulged his  own will, the more he held his vassals in dependence.  Prudence and  innocence, without the favour of the Chief, conferred no security; and  crimes involved no danger, when the judge was resolute to acquit.    When the chiefs were men of knowledge and virtue, the convenience of a  domestick judicature was great.  No long journies were necessary, nor  artificial delays could be practised; the character, the alliances, and  interests of the litigants were known to the court, and all false  pretences were easily detected.  The sentence, when it was past, could  not be evaded; the power of the Laird superseded formalities, and justice  could not be defeated by interest or stratagem.    I doubt not but that since the regular judges have made their circuits  through the whole country, right has been every where more wisely, and  more equally distributed; the complaint is, that litigation is grown  troublesome, and that the magistrates are too few, and therefore often  too remote for general convenience.    Many of the smaller Islands have no legal officer within them.  I once  asked, If a crime should be committed, by what authority the offender  could be seized? and was told, that the Laird would exert his right; a  right which he must now usurp, but which surely necessity must vindicate,  and which is therefore yet exercised in lower degrees, by some of the  proprietors, when legal processes cannot be obtained.    In all greater questions, however, there is now happily an end to all  fear or hope from malice or from favour.  The roads are secure in those  places through which, forty years ago, no traveller could pass without a  convoy.  All trials of right by the sword are forgotten, and the mean are  in as little danger from the powerful as in other places.  No scheme of  policy has, in any country, yet brought the rich and poor on equal terms  into courts of judicature.  Perhaps experience, improving on experience,  may in time effect it.    Those who have long enjoyed dignity and power, ought not to lose it  without some equivalent.  There was paid to the Chiefs by the publick, in  exchange for their privileges, perhaps a sum greater than most of them  had ever possessed, which excited a thirst for riches, of which it shewed  them the use.  When the power of birth and station ceases, no hope  remains but from the prevalence of money.  Power and wealth supply the  place of each other.  Power confers the ability of gratifying our desire  without the consent of others.  Wealth enables us to obtain the consent  of others to our gratification.  Power, simply considered, whatever it  confers on one, must take from another.  Wealth enables its owner to give  to others, by taking only from himself.  Power pleases the violent and  proud: wealth delights the placid and the timorous.  Youth therefore  flies at power, and age grovels after riches.    The Chiefs, divested of their prerogatives, necessarily turned their  thoughts to the improvement of their revenues, and expect more rent, as  they have less homage.  The tenant, who is far from perceiving that his  condition is made better in the same proportion, as that of his landlord  is made worse, does not immediately see why his industry is to be taxed  more heavily than before.  He refuses to pay the demand, and is ejected;  the ground is then let to a stranger, who perhaps brings a larger stock,  but who, taking the land at its full price, treats with the Laird upon  equal terms, and considers him not as a Chief, but as a trafficker in  land.  Thus the estate perhaps is improved, but the clan is broken.    It seems to be the general opinion, that the rents have been raised with  too much eagerness.  Some regard must be paid to prejudice.  Those who  have hitherto paid but little, will not suddenly be persuaded to pay  much, though they can afford it.  As ground is gradually improved, and  the value of money decreases, the rent may be raised without any  diminution of the farmer's profits: yet it is necessary in these  countries, where the ejection of a tenant is a greater evil, than in more  populous places, to consider not merely what the land will produce, but  with what ability the inhabitant can cultivate it.  A certain stock can  allow but a certain payment; for if the land be doubled, and the stock  remains the same, the tenant becomes no richer.  The proprietors of the  Highlands might perhaps often increase their income, by subdividing the  farms, and allotting to every occupier only so many acres as he can  profitably employ, but that they want people.    There seems now, whatever be the cause, to be through a great part of the  Highlands a general discontent.  That adherence, which was lately  professed by every man to the chief of his name, has now little  prevalence; and he that cannot live as he desires at home, listens to the  tale of fortunate islands, and happy regions, where every man may have  land of his own, and eat the product of his labour without a superior.    Those who have obtained grants of American lands, have, as is well known,  invited settlers from all quarters of the globe; and among other places,  where oppression might produce a wish for new habitations, their  emissaries would not fail to try their persuasions in the Isles of  Scotland, where at the time when the clans were newly disunited from  their Chiefs, and exasperated by unprecedented exactions, it is no wonder  that they prevailed.    Whether the mischiefs of emigration were immediately perceived, may be  justly questioned.  They who went first, were probably such as could best  be spared; but the accounts sent by the earliest adventurers, whether  true or false, inclined many to follow them; and whole neighbourhoods  formed parties for removal; so that departure from their native country  is no longer exile.  He that goes thus accompanied, carries with him all  that makes life pleasant.  He sits down in a better climate, surrounded  by his kindred and his friends: they carry with them their language,  their opinions, their popular songs, and hereditary merriment: they  change nothing but the place of their abode; and of that change they  perceive the benefit.    This is the real effect of emigration, if those that go away together  settle on the same spot, and preserve their ancient union.  But some  relate that these adventurous visitants of unknown regions, after a  voyage passed in dreams of plenty and felicity, are dispersed at last  upon a Sylvan wilderness, where their first years must be spent in toil,  to clear the ground which is afterwards to be tilled, and that the whole  effect of their undertakings is only more fatigue and equal scarcity.    Both accounts may be suspected.  Those who are gone will endeavour by  every art to draw others after them; for as their numbers are greater,  they will provide better for themselves.  When Nova Scotia was first  peopled, I remember a letter, published under the character of a New  Planter, who related how much the climate put him in mind of Italy.  Such  intelligence the Hebridians probably receive from their transmarine  correspondents.  But with equal temptations of interest, and perhaps with  no greater niceness of veracity, the owners of the Islands spread stories  of American hardships to keep their people content at home.    Some method to stop this epidemick desire of "]]]
