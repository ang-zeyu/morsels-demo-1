The \"treasuring\" of capital instead of the investment of it  is, therefore, one of the reasons why industries in Persia seldom assume  large proportions. It is only the small merchant, content to make a  humble profit, who can prosper in his own small way while more extensive  concerns are distrusted.    But it must not be understood that Persians do not care for money. There  is, on the contrary, hardly a race of people on the face of the earth  with whom the greed for money is developed to such an abnormal extent as  in all classes in the land of Iran! But, you will ask, how can money be  procured or increased fast and without trouble in a country where there  is no commercial enterprise, where labour is interfered with, where  capital cannot have a free outlet or investment? An opening has to be  found in illicit ways of procuring wealth, and the most common form  adopted is the loan of money at high interest on ample security. As much  as 50 per cent., 80 per cent., 100 per cent. and even more is demanded  and obtained as interest on private loans, 15 per cent. being the very  lowest and deemed most reasonable indeed! (This does not apply to foreign  banks.) All this may seem strange in a Mussulman country, where it is  against all the laws of the Koran to lend money at usury, and it is more  strange still to find that the principal offenders are the Mullahs  themselves, who reap large profits from such illegal financial  operations.    The Persian is a dreamer by nature; he cannot be said to be absolutely  lazy, for he is always absorbed in deep thought--what the thoughts are it  does not do to analyse too closely--but he devotes so much time to  thinking that he seldom can do anything else. His mind--like the minds  of all people unaccustomed to hard work and steady, solidly-built  enterprise--runs to the fantastic, and he ever expects immense returns  for doing nothing. The returns, if any, and no matter how large they may  be, are ever too small to satisfy his expectations.    As for time, there is no country where it is worth less than to the  natives of Persia. The _manana_ of the Spaniards sinks into perfect  insignificance when compared with the habits of the land of Iran.  Punctuality is unknown--especially in payments, for a Persian must take  time to reflect over everything. He cannot be hurried. A three months'  limit of credit--or even six months--seems outrageously short in the eyes  of Persians. Twelve months and eighteen, twenty, or twenty-four months  suit him better, but even then he is never ready to pay, unless under  great pressure. He does disburse the money in the end, capital and  interest, but why people should worry over time, and why it should matter  whether payment occurs to-day or to-morrow are quite beyond him.    If he does transact business, days are wasted in useless talk and  compliments before the subject with which he intends to deal is  incidentally approached in conversation, and then more hours and days and  weeks, even months have to elapse before he can make up his mind what to  do. Our haste, and what we consider smartness in business, are looked  upon by the Persian as quite an acute form of lunacy,--and really, when  one is thrown much in contact with such delightful placidity, almost  torpor, and looks back upon one's hard race for a living and one's  struggle and competition in every department, one almost begins to fancy  that we are lunatics after all!    [Illustration: The Arrival of a Caravan of Silver at the Imperial Bank of  Persia.]    The Persian must have his hours for praying, his hours for ablutions,  more hours for meditation, and the rest for sleep and food. Whether you  hasten or not, he thinks, you will only live the number of years that God  wills for you, and you will live those years in the way that He has  destined for you. Each day will be no longer and no shorter, your life no  sadder and no happier. Why then hurry?    Amid such philosophic views, business in European fashion does not  promise to prosper.    Unable to attach a true meaning to words--his language is beautiful but  its flowery form conduces to endless misunderstandings--casual to a  degree in fulfilling work as he has stipulated to do it; such is the  Persian of to-day. Whether the vicissitudes of his country, the fearful  wars, the famines, the climate, the official oppression have made him so,  or whether he has always been so, is not easy to tell, but that is how he  is now.    Besides all this, each man is endowed with a maximum of ambition and  conceit, each individual fully believing himself the greatest man that  ever lived and absolute perfection. Moreover the influence of Mullahs is  used to oppose reform and improvement, so that altogether the economic  development of production, distribution and circulation of capital is  bound to be hampered to no mean extent. On examining things carefully it  seems almost astonishing that the trade of Persia should be as well  developed as it is.    Another difficulty in the way is the currency, which offers some  interesting lessons, and I am indebted to the author of a paper read  before the Statistical Society for the following details.    Gold is not produced in Persia. Bar gold is imported in very small  quantities only. Gold coin is a mere commodity--is quite scarce, and is  mostly used for presents and hoarding. It is minted principally from  Russian Imperials and Turkish pounds which drift into Persia in small  quantities in the course of business. Goldsmiths, too, in their work,  make use of foreign coins, although some gold and silver bullion is  imported for manufacturing purposes.    Silver, too, is not obtainable in Persia except in very small quantities,  and the imported silver comes from Great Britain, _via_ the Gulf or _via_  Hamburg and Russia. In the year 1901 the Persian Government, in  connection with the Russian Loan, imported some three million tomans'  worth of silver to be minted, and the Imperial Bank of Persia another  million tomans; while some 500,000 tomans more were brought into the  country by other importers. But under normal circumstances the annual  output hardly ever exceeds three to four million tomans. In 1900 it was  something between 2,000,000 and 2,500,000 tomans.    The Mint--like all other institutions of Persia--is in a tumbling-down  condition, with an ancient plant (1877) so obsolete and worn as to be  almost useless. Partly owing to the insufficient production of coin,  partly because of the export in great quantities of Persian silver coin  into Transcaspia, and, last but not least, owing to the Persian custom of  \"making a corner\" by speculators, the commercial centres of Persia suffer  from a normal dearth of silver coins. Persian silver coin has for the  foregoing reasons a purchasing power of sometimes 20 per cent. beyond its  intrinsic value. In distant cities, like Yezd or Kerman, it is difficult  to obtain large sums in silver coin at face value, as it disappears into  the villages almost as soon as it arrives by caravan or post. New coin is  generally in great demand and commands a premium.    So the yearly drain of silver coin from Teheran as soon as it is minted  is very considerable, especially to the north, north-east and north-west  provinces. This coin does not circulate but is almost entirely absorbed  and never reappears, the people themselves holding it, as we have seen,  as treasure, and huge quantities finding their way into Transcaspia and  eventually into Afghanistan, where Persian coin is current and at a  premium, especially on the border land.    In Transcaspia Persian coin is cherished because the nominally equivalent  Persian coin contains a much larger quantity of silver than the Russian.  Russian silver is a mere token of currency, or, at best, stands midway  between a token and a standard or international currency, and its  difference when compared with the Persian coin amounts to no less than  21.92 per cent. in favour of the Persian. Persian coin, although  defective and about 2 per cent. below legal weight and fineness, is a  standard or international currency.    It appears that a good deal of the silver exported into Transcaspia finds  its way to Chinese Turkestan, where it is converted into bars and ingots,  and is used for the inland trade to China. The Russian Government have  done all in their power to prevent the competition of Persian and Russian  coins in their Transcaspian provinces. A decree was issued some eleven  years ago forbidding the importation, and in 1897 a second Ukase further  prohibited foreign silver from entering the country after the 13th of May  (1st of May of our calendar), and a duty of about 20 per cent. was  imposed on silver crossing the frontier. All this has resulted in silver  entering the provinces by smuggling instead of openly, but it finds its  way there in large quantities just the same as before.    The Government of Persia does not issue bank-notes, which would be  regarded with suspicion among the people, but it is interesting to find  that the monopoly granted to the Imperial Bank of Persia for the issue of  paper money has had excellent results, in Teheran particularly, where the  Bank is held in high esteem and the notes have been highly appreciated.  In other cities of Persia which I visited, however, the notes did not  circulate, and were only accepted at the Bank's agencies and in the  bazaar by some of the larger merchants at a small discount.    Naturally, with the methods adopted by Persians, and the insecurity which  prevails everywhere, the process of convincing the natives that a piece  of printed paper is equivalent to so many silver krans, and that the  silver krans will surely be produced in full on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#19)"],[1,"ant.
