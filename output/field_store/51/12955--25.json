I'm sure  we're very comfortable here together and you know you would miss me  terribly if I went away.\"    \"If you took the right one you wouldn't go so very far,\" said Mrs.  Theodora, darkly significant. \"And, anyhow, I'd put up with any amount  of lonesomeness rather than have an old maid in the family. It's all  very fine now, when you're still young enough and good looking, with  lots of beaus at your beck and call. But that won't last much longer  and if you go on with your dilly-dallying you'll wake up some fine day  to find that your time for choosing has gone by. Your mother used to  be dreadful proud of your good looks when you was a baby. I told her  she needn't be. Nine times out of ten a beauty don't marry as well as  an ordinary girl.\"    \"I'm not much set on marrying at all,\" declared Judith sharply. Any  reference to the \"right one\" always disturbed her placidity. The real  root of the trouble was that Mrs. Theodora's \"right one\" and Judith's  \"right one\" were two different people.    The Ramble Valley young men were very fond of dancing attendance on  Judith, even if she were verging on old maidenhood. Her prettiness was  undeniable; the Stewarts came to maturity late and at twenty-seven  Judith's dower of milky-white flesh, dimpled red lips and shining  bronze hair was at its fullest splendor. Besides, she was \"jolly,\" and  jollity went a long way in Ramble Valley popularity.    Of all Judith's admirers Eben King alone found favor in Mrs.  Theodora's eyes. He owned the adjoining farm, was well off and  homely--so homely that Judith declared it made her eyes ache to look  at him.    Bruce Marshall, Judith's \"right one\" was handsome, but Mrs. Theodora  looked upon him with sour disapproval. He owned a stony little farm at  the remote end of Ramble Valley and was reputed to be fonder of many  things than of work. To be sure, Judith had enough capability and  energy for two; but Mrs. Theodora detested a lazy man. She ordered  Judith not to encourage him and Judith obeyed. Judith generally obeyed  her aunt; but, though she renounced Bruce Marshall, she would have  nothing to do with Eben King or anybody else and all Mrs. Theodora's  grumblings did not mend matters.    The afternoon that Mrs. Tony Mack came in Mrs. Theodora felt more  aggrieved than ever. Ellie McGregor had been married the previous  week--Ellie, who was the same age as Judith and not half so good  looking. Mrs. Theodora had been nagging Judith ever since.    \"But I might as well talk to the trees down there in that hollow,\" she  complained to Mrs. Tony. \"That girl is so set and contrary minded. She  doesn't care a bit for my feelings.\"    This was not said behind Judith's back. The girl herself was standing  at the open door, drinking in all the delicate, evasive beauty of the  spring afternoon. The Whitney house crested a bare hill that looked  down on misty intervals, feathered with young firs that were golden  green in the pale sunlight. The fields were bare and smoking, although  the lanes and shadowy places were full of moist snow. Judith's face  was aglow with the delight of mere life and she bent out to front the  brisk, dancing wind that blew up from the valley, resinous with the  odors of firs and damp mosses.    At her aunt's words the glow went out of her face. She listened with  her eyes brooding on the hollow and a glowing flame of temper  smouldering in them. Judith's long patience was giving way. She had  been flicked on the raw too often of late. And now her aunt was  confiding her grievances to Mrs. Tony Mack--the most notorious gossip  in Ramble Valley or out of it!    \"I can't sleep at nights for worrying over what will become of her  when I'm gone,\" went on Mrs. Theodora dismally. \"She'll just have to  live on alone here--a lonesome, withered-up old maid. And her that  might have had her pick, Mrs. Tony, though I do say it as shouldn't.  You must feel real thankful to have all your girls married  off--especially when none of them was extry good-looking. Some people  have all the luck. I'm tired of talking to Judith. Folks'll be saying  soon that nobody ever really wanted her, for all her flirting. But she  just won't marry.\"    \"I will!\"    Judith whirled about on the sun warm door step and came in. Her black  eyes were flashing and her round cheeks were crimson.    \"Such a temper you never saw!\" reported Mrs. Tony afterwards. \"Though  'tweren't to be wondered at. Theodora was most awful aggravating.\"    \"I will,\" repeated Judith stormily. \"I'm tired of being nagged day in  and day out. I'll marry--and what is more I'll marry the very first  man that asks me--that I will, if it is old Widower Delane himself!  How does that suit you, Aunt Theodora?\"    Mrs. Theodora's mental processes were never slow. She dropped her  knitting ball and stooped for it. In that time she had decided what to  do. She knew that Judith would stick to her word, Stewart-like, and  she must trim her sails to catch this new wind.    \"It suits me real well, Judith,\" she said calmly, \"you can marry the  first man that asks you and I'll say no word to hinder.\"    The color went out of Judith's face, leaving it pale as ashes. Her  hasty assertion had no sooner been uttered than it was repented of,  but she must stand by it now. She went out of the kitchen without  another glance at her aunt or the delighted Mrs. Tony and dashed up  the stairs to her own little room which looked out over the whole of  Ramble Valley. It was warm with the March sunshine and the leafless  boughs of the creeper that covered the end of the house were tapping a  gay tattoo on the window panes to the music of the wind.    Judith sat down in her little rocker and dropped her pointed chin in  her hands. Far down the valley, over the firs on the McGregor hill and  the blue mirror of the Cranston pond, Bruce Marshall's little gray  house peeped out from a semicircle of white-stemmed birches. She had  not seen Bruce since before Christmas. He had been angry at her then  because she had refused to let him drive her home from prayer meeting.  Since then she had heard a rumor that he was going to see Kitty Leigh  at the Upper Valley.    Judith looked sombrely down at the Marshall homestead. She had always  loved the quaint, picturesque old place, so different from all the  commonplace spick and span new houses of the prosperous valley. Judith  had never been able to decide whether she really cared very much for  Bruce Marshall or not, but she knew that she loved that rambling,  cornery house of his, with the gable festooned with the real ivy that  Bruce Marshall's great-grandmother had brought with her from England.  Judith thought contrastingly of Eben King's staring, primrose-colored  house in all its bare, intrusive grandeur. She gave a little shrug of  distaste.    \"I wish Bruce knew of this,\" she thought, flushing even in her  solitude at the idea. \"Although if it is true that he is going to see  Kitty Leigh I don't suppose he'd care. And Aunt Theo will be sure to  send word to Eben by hook or crook. Whatever possessed me to say such  a mad thing? There goes Mrs. Tony now, all agog to spread such a  delectable bit of gossip.\"    Mrs. Tony had indeed gone, refusing Mrs. Theodora's invitation to stay  to tea, so eager was she to tell her story. And Mrs. Theodora, at that  very minute, was out in her kitchen yard, giving her instructions to  Potter Vane, the twelve year old urchin who cut her wood and did  sundry other chores for her.    \"Potter,\" she said, excitedly, \"run over to the Kings' and tell Eben  to come over here immediately--no matter what he's at. Tell him I want  to see him about something of the greatest importance.\"    Mrs. Theodora thought that this was a master stroke.    \"That match is as good as made,\" she thought triumphantly as she  picked up chips to start the tea fire. \"If Judith suspects that Eben  is here she is quite likely to stay in her room and refuse to come  down. But if she does I'll march him upstairs to her door and make him  ask her through the keyhole. You can't stump Theodora Whitney.\"    Alas! Ten minutes later Potter returned with the unwelcome news that  Eben was away from home.    \"He went to Wexbridge about half an hour ago, his ma said. She said  she'd tell him to come right over as soon as he kem home.\"    Mrs. Theodora had to content herself with this, but she felt troubled.  She knew Mrs. Tony Mack's capabilities for spreading news. What if  Bruce Marshall should hear it before Eben?    That evening Jacob Plowden's store at Wexbridge was full of men,  sitting about on kegs and counters or huddling around the stove, for  the March air had grown sharp as the sun lowered in the creamy sky  over the Ramble Valley hills. Eben King had a keg in the corner. He  was in no hurry to go home for he loved gossip dearly and the  Wexbridge stores abounded with it. He had exhausted the news of Peter  Stanley's store across the bridge and now he meant to hear what was  saying at Plowden's. Bruce Marshall was there, too, buying groceries  and being waited on by Nora Plowden, who was by no means averse to the  service, although as a rule her father's customers received scanty  tolerance at her hands.    \"What are the Valley roads like, Marshall?\" asked a Wexbridge man,  between two squirts of tobacco juice.    \"Bad,\" said Bruce briefly. \"Another warm day will finish the  sleighing.\"    \"Are they crossing at Malley's Creek yet?\" asked Plowden.    \"No, Jack Carr got in there day before yesterday. Nearly lost his  mare. I came round by the main road,\" responded Bruce.    The door opened at this point and Tony Mack came in. As soon as he  closed the door he doubled up in a fit of chuckles, which lasted until  he was purple in the face.    \"Is the man crazy?\" demanded Plowden, who had never seen lean little  Tony visited like this before.    \"Crazy"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#19)"],[1," far purple curves of the hills. Suddenly, glancing over  his shoulder, he saw through an arch of black fir boughs a young moon  swung low in a lake of palely tinted saffron sky. He smiled a little,  remembering that in boyhood it had been held a good omen to see the  new moon over the right shoulder.    Down in the valley the lights began to twinkle out here and there like  earth-stars. He would wait until he saw the kitchen light from the  window of his old home. Then he would go. He waited until the whole  valley was zoned with a glittering girdle, but no light glimmered out  through his native trees. Why was it lacking, that light he had so  often hailed at dark, coming home from boyish rambles on the hills? He  felt anxious and dissatisfied, as if he could not go away until he had  seen it.    When it was quite dark he descended the hill resolutely. He must know  why the homelight had failed him. When he found himself in the old  garden his heart grew sick and sore with disappointment and a bitter  homesickness. It needed but a glance, even in the dimness of the  summer night, to see that the old house was deserted and falling to  decay. The kitchen door swung open on rusty hinges; the windows were  broken and lifeless; weeds grew thickly over the yard and crowded  wantonly up to the very threshold through the chinks of the rotten  platform.    Cuthbert Marshall sat down on the old red sandstone step of the door  and bowed his head in his hands. This was what he had come back  to--this ghost and wreck of his past! Oh, bitterness!    From where he sat he saw the new house that Stephen had built beyond  the fir grove, with a cheerful light shining from its window. After a  long time he went over to it and knocked at the door. Stephen came to  it, a stout grizzled farmer, with a chubby boy on his shoulder. He was  not much changed; Cuthbert easily recognized him, but to Stephen  Marshall no recognition came of this man with whom he had played and  worked for years. Cuthbert was obliged to tell who he was. He was made  instantly and warmly welcome. Stephen was unfeignedly glad to see him,  and Stephen's comely wife, whom he remembered as a slim, fresh-cheeked  valley girl, extended a kind and graceful hospitality. The boys and  girls, too, soon made friends with him. Yet he felt himself the  stranger and the alien, whom the long, swift-passing years had shut  forever from his old place.    He and Stephen talked late that night, and in the morning he yielded  to their entreaties to stay another day with them. He spent it  wandering about the farm and the old haunts of wood and stream. Yet he  could not find himself. This valley had his past in its keeping, but  it could not give it back to him; he had lost the master word that  might have compelled it.    He asked Stephen fully about all his old friends and neighbours with  one exception. He could not ask him what had become of Joyce Cameron.  The question was on his lips a dozen times, but he shrank from  uttering it. He had a vague, secret dread that the answer, whatever it  might be, would hurt him.    In the evening he yielded to a whim and went across to the Cameron  homestead, by the old footpath which was still kept open. He walked  slowly and dreamily, with his eyes on the far hills scarfed in the  splendour of sunset. So he had walked in the old days, but he had no  dreams now of what lay beyond the hills, and Joyce would not be  waiting among the firs.    The stile he remembered was gone, replaced by a little rustic gate. As  he passed through it he lifted his eyes and there before him he saw  her, standing tall and gracious among the grey trees, with the light  from the west falling over her face. So she had stood, so she had  looked many an evening of the long-ago. She had not changed; he  realized that in the first amazed, incredulous glance. Perhaps there  were lines on her face, a thread or two of silver in the soft brown  hair, but those splendid steady blue eyes were the same, and the soul  of her looked out through them, true to itself, the staunch, brave,  sweet soul of the maiden ripened to womanhood.    \"Joyce!\" he said, stupidly, unbelievingly.    She smiled and put out her hand. \"I am glad to see you, Cuthbert,\" she  said simply. \"Stephen's Mary told me you had come. And I thought you  would be over to see us this evening.\"    She had offered him only one hand but he took both and held her so,  looking hungrily down at her as a man looks at something he knows must  be his salvation if salvation exists for him.    \"Is it possible you are here still, Joyce?\" he said slowly. \"And you  have not changed at all.\"    She coloured slightly and pulled away her hands, laughing. \"Oh, indeed  I have. I have grown old. The twilight is so kind it hides that, but  it is true. Come into the house, Cuthbert. Father and Mother will be  glad to see you.\"    \"After a little,\" he said imploringly. \"Let us stay here awhile first,  Joyce. I want to make sure that this is no dream. Last night I stood  on those hills yonder and looked down, but I meant to go away because  I thought there would be no one left to welcome me. If I had known you  were here! You have lived here in the old valley all these years?\"    \"All these years,\" she said gently, \"I suppose you think it must have  been a very meagre life?\"    \"No. I am much wiser now than I was once, Joyce. I have learned wisdom  beyond the hills. One learns there--in time--but sometimes the lesson  is learned too late. Shall I tell you what I have learned, Joyce? The  gist of the lesson is that I left happiness behind me in the old  valley, when I went away from it, happiness and peace and the joy of  living. I did not miss these things for a long while; I did not even  know I had lost them. But I have discovered my loss.\"    \"Yet you have been a very successful man,\" she said wonderingly.    \"As the world calls success,\" he answered bitterly. \"I have place and  wealth and power. But that is not success, Joyce. I am tired of these  things; they are the toys of grown-up children; they do not satisfy  the man's soul. I have come back to the old valley seeking for what  might satisfy, but I have little hope of finding it, unless--unless--\"    He was silent, remembering that he had forfeited all right to her help  in the quest. Yet he realized clearly that only she could help him,  only she could guide him back to the path he had missed. It seemed to  him that she held in her keeping all the good of his life, all the  beauty of his past, all the possibilities of his future. Hers was the  master word, but how should he dare ask her to utter it?    They walked among the firs until the stars came out, and they talked  of many things. She had kept her freshness of soul and her ideals  untarnished. In the peace of the old valley she had lived a life,  narrow outwardly, wondrously deep and wide in thought and aspiration.  Her native hills bounded the vision of her eyes, but the outlook of  the soul was far and unhindered. In the quiet places and the green  ways she had found what he had failed to find--the secret of happiness  and content. He knew that if this woman had walked hand in hand with  him through the years, life, even in the glare and tumult of that  world beyond the hills, would never have lost its meaning for him. Oh,  fool and blind that he had been! While he had sought and toiled afar,  the best that God had meant for him had been here in the home of  youth. When darkness came down through the firs he told her all this,  haltingly, blunderingly, yearningly.    \"Joyce, is it too late? Can you forgive my mistake, my long blindness?  Can you care for me again--a little?\"    She turned her face upward to the sky between the swaying fir tops and  he saw the reflection of a star in her eyes. \"I have never ceased to  care,\" she said in a low tone. \"I never really wanted to cease. It  would have left life too empty. If my love means so much to you it is  yours, Cuthbert--it always has been yours.\"    He drew her close into his arms, and as he felt her heart beating  against his he understood that he had found the way back to simple  happiness and true wisdom, the wisdom of loving and the happiness of  being loved.          Jane Lavinia      Jane Lavinia put her precious portfolio down on the table in her room,  carefully, as if its contents were fine gold, and proceeded to unpin  and take off her second-best hat. When she had gone over to the  Whittaker place that afternoon, she had wanted to wear her best hat,  but Aunt Rebecca had vetoed that uncompromisingly.    \"Next thing you'll be wanting to wear your best muslin to go for the  cows,\" said Aunt Rebecca sarcastically. \"You go right back upstairs  and take off that chiffon hat. If I was fool enough to be coaxed into  buying it for you, I ain't going to have you spoil it by traipsing  hither and yon with it in the dust and sun. Your last summer's sailor  is plenty good enough to go to the Whittakers' in, Jane Lavinia.\"    \"But Mr. Stephens and his wife are from New York,\" pleaded Jane  Lavinia, \"and she's so stylish.\"    \"Well, it's likely they're used to seeing chiffon hats,\" Aunt Rebecca  responded, more sarcastically than ever. \"It isn't probable that yours  would make much of a sensation. Mr. Stephens didn't send for you to  show him your chiffon hat, did he? If he did, I don't see what you're  lugging that big portfolio along with you for. Go and put on your  sailor hat, Jane Lavinia.\"    Jane Lavinia obeyed. She always obeyed Aunt Rebecca. But she took off  the chiffon hat and pinned on the sailor with bitterness of heart. She  had always hated that sailor. Anything ugly hurt Jane Lavinia with an  intensity that Aunt Rebecca could never understand; and the sailor hat  was ugly, with its stiff little black bows and impossible blue roses.  It jarred on Jane Lavinia's artistic instincts. Besides, it was very  unbecoming.    I look horrid in it, Jane"]]]
