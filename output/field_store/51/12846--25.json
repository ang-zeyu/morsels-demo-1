He ought to know something concerning the mind, as well as a  great deal concerning the body of man.    For this purpose, it is not necessary that he should go into such a  compass of reading, as must, by distracting his attention, disqualify him  for the practical part of his profession, and make him sink the performer  in the critic.  Reading, if it can be made the favourite recreation of  his leisure hours, will improve and enlarge his mind without retarding  his actual industry.    What such partial and desultory reading cannot afford, may be supplied by  the conversation of learned and ingenious men, which is the best of all  substitutes for those who have not the means or opportunities of deep  study.  There are many such men in this age; and they will be pleased  with communicating their ideas to artists, when they see them curious and  docile, if they are treated with that respect and deference which is so  justly their due.  Into such society, young artists, if they make it the  point of their ambition, will by degrees be admitted.  There, without  formal teaching, they will insensibly come to feel and reason like those  they live with, and find a rational and systematic taste imperceptibly  formed in their minds, which they will know how to reduce to a standard,  by applying general truth to their own purposes, better perhaps than  those to whom they owed the original sentiment.    Of these studies and this conversation, the desired and legitimate  offspring is a power of distinguishing right from wrong, which power  applied to works of art is denominated taste.  Let me then, without  further introduction, enter upon an examination whether taste be so far  beyond our reach as to be unattainable by care, or be so very vague and  capricious that no care ought to be employed about it.    It has been the fate of arts to be enveloped in mysterious and  incomprehensible language, as if it was thought necessary that even the  terms should correspond to the idea entertained of the instability and  uncertainty of the rules which they expressed.    To speak of genius and taste as any way connected with reason or common  sense, would be, in the opinion of some towering talkers, to speak like a  man who possessed neither, who had never felt that enthusiasm, or, to use  their own inflated language, was never warmed by that Promethean fire,  which animates the canvas and vivifies the marble.    If, in order to be intelligible, I appear to degrade art by bringing her  down from her visionary situation in the clouds, it is only to give her a  more solid mansion upon the earth.  It is necessary that at some time or  other we should see things as they really are, and not impose on  ourselves by that false magnitude with which objects appear when viewed  indistinctly as through a mist.    We will allow a poet to express his meaning, when his meaning is not well  known to himself, with a certain degree of obscurity, as it is one source  of the sublime.  But when, in plain prose, we gravely talk of courting  the muse in shady bowers, waiting the call and inspiration of genius,  finding out where he inhabits, and where he is to be invoked with the  greatest success; of attending to times and seasons when the imagination  shoots with the greatest vigour, whether at the summer solstice or the  equinox, sagaciously observing how much the wild freedom and liberty of  imagination is cramped by attention to established rules, and how this  same imagination begins to grow dim in advanced age, smothered and  deadened by too much judgment.  When we talk such language, or entertain  such sentiments as these, we generally rest contented with mere words, or  at best entertain notions not only groundless, but pernicious.    If all this means what it is very possible was originally intended only  to be meant, that in order to cultivate an art, a man secludes himself  from the commerce of the world, and retires into the country at  particular seasons; or that at one time of the year his body is in better  health, and consequently his mind fitter for the business of hard  thinking than at another time; or that the mind may be fatigued and grow  confused by long and unremitted application; this I can understand.  I  can likewise believe that a man eminent when young for possessing  poetical imagination, may, from having taken another road, so neglect its  cultivation as to show less of its powers in his latter life.  But I am  persuaded that scarce a poet is to be found, from Homer down to Dryden,  who preserved a sound mind in a sound body, and continued practising his  profession to the very last, whose later works are not as replete with  the fire of imagination as those which were produced in his more youthful  days.    To understand literally these metaphors or ideas expressed in poetical  language, seems to be equally absurd as to conclude that because painters  sometimes represent poets writing from the dictates of a little winged  boy or genius, that this same genius did really inform him in a whisper  what he was to write, and that he is himself but a mere machine,  unconscious of the operations of his own mind.    Opinions generally received and floating in the world, whether true or  false, we naturally adopt and make our own; they may be considered as a  kind of inheritance to which we succeed and are tenants for life, and  which we leave to our posterity very near in the condition in which we  received it; not much being in any one man's power either to impair or  improve it.    The greatest part of these opinions, like current coin in its  circulation, we are obliged to take without weighing or examining; but by  this inevitable inattention, many adulterated pieces are received, which,  when we seriously estimate our wealth, we must throw away.  So the  collector of popular opinions, when he embodies his knowledge, and forms  a system, must separate those which are true from those which are only  plausible.  But it becomes more peculiarly a duty to the professors of  art not to let any opinions relating to that art pass unexamined.  The  caution and circumspection required in such examination we shall  presently have an opportunity of explaining.    Genius and taste, in their common acceptation, appear to be very nearly  related; the difference lies only in this, that genius has superadded to  it a habit or power of execution.  Or we may say, that taste, when this  power is added, changes its name, and is called genius.  They both, in  the popular opinion, pretend to an entire exemption from the restraint of  rules.  It is supposed that their powers are intuitive; that under the  name of genius great works are produced, and under the name of taste an  exact judgment is given, without our knowing why, and without being under  the least obligation to reason, precept, or experience.    One can scarce state these opinions without exposing their absurdity, yet  they are constantly in the mouths of men, and particularly of artists.  They who have thought seriously on this subject, do not carry the point  so far; yet I am persuaded, that even among those few who may be called  thinkers, the prevalent opinion gives less than it ought to the powers of  reason; and considers the principles of taste, which give all their  authority to the rules of art, as more fluctuating, and as having less  solid foundations than we shall find, upon examination, they really have.    The common saying, that tastes are not to be disputed, owes its  influence, and its general reception, to the same error which leads us to  imagine it of too high original to submit to the authority of an earthly  tribunal.  It will likewise correspond with the notions of those who  consider it as a mere phantom of the imagination, so devoid of substance  as to elude all criticism.    We often appear to differ in sentiments from each other, merely from the  inaccuracy of terms, as we are not obliged to speak always with critical  exactness.  Something of this too may arise from want of words in the  language to express the more nice discriminations which a deep  investigation discovers.  A great deal, however, of this difference  vanishes when each opinion is tolerably explained and understood by  constancy and precision in the use of terms.    We apply the term taste to that act of the mind by which we like or  dislike, whatever be the subject.  Our judgment upon an airy nothing, a  fancy which has no foundation, is called by the same name which we give  to our determination concerning those truths which refer to the most  general and most unalterable principles of human nature, to works which  are only to be produced by the greatest efforts of the human  understanding.  However inconvenient this may be, we are obliged to take  words as we find them; all we can do is to distinguish the things to  which they are applied.    We may let pass those things which are at once subjects of taste and  sense, and which having as much certainty as the senses themselves, give  no occasion to inquiry or dispute.  The natural appetite or taste of the  human mind is for truth; whether that truth results from the real  agreement or equality of original ideas among themselves; from the  agreement of the representation of any object with the thing represented;  or from the correspondence of the several parts of any arrangement with  each other.  It is the very same taste which relishes a demonstration in  geometry, that is pleased with the resemblance of a picture to an  original, and touched with the harmony of music.    All these have unalterable and fixed foundations in nature, and are  therefore equally investigated by reason, and known by study; some with  more, some with less clearness, but all exactly in the same way.  A  picture that is unlike, is false.

(c) What bone in the rabbit is  generally regarded as corresponding to the quadrate cartilage of the  frog?        -The Dog-Fish_    1. _General Anatomy_    Section 1. In the dog-fish we have a far more antique type of  structure than in any of the forms we have hitherto considered.  Forms closely related to it occur among the earliest remains of  vertebrata that are to be found in the geological record. Since the  immeasurably remote Silurian period, sharks and dog-fish have  probably remained without any essential changes of condition, and  consequently without any essential changes of structure, down to  the present day. Then, as now, they dominated the seas. They  probably branched off from the other vertebrata before bone had  become abundant in the inner skeleton, which is consequently in their  case cartilaginous, with occasional \"calcification\" and no distinct  bones at all. Unlike the majority of fish, they possess no swimming  bladder-- the precursor of the lungs; but in many other respects,  notably in the uro-genital organs, they have, in common with the  higher vertebrata, preserved features which may have been disguised  or lost in the perfecting of such modern and specialized fish as, for  instance, the cod, salmon, or herring.      Section 2. Comparing the general build, of a dog-fish with that of a  rabbit, we notice the absence of a distinct neck, and the general  conical form; the presence of a large tail, as considerable, at first, in  diameter as the hind portion of the body, and of the first importance in  progression, in which function the four paddle-shaped limbs, the  lateral fins, simply co-operate with the median fin along the back for  the purpose of steering; and, as a consequence of the size of the  tail, we note also the ventral position of the apertures of the body. The  anus, and urinary and genital ducts unite in one common chamber,  the cloaca. Behind the head, and in front of the fore fin (pectoral fin),  are five gill slits (g.s.) leading from the pharynx to the exterior. Just  behind the eye is a smaller and more dorsal opening of the same  kind, the spiracle (sp.). On the under side of the head, in front of the  mouth, is the nasal aperture (olf.), the opening of the nasal sac,  which, unlike the corresponding organ of the air-frequenting vertebrata,  has no internal narial opening. There is, however, a groove running  from olf. to the corner of the mouth, and this, closing, in the vertebrate  types that live in air and are exposed to incessant evaporation of their  lubricating secretions, constitutes the primitive nasal passage. The  limbs are undifferentiated into upper, lower, and digital portions, and  are simply jointed, flattened expansions.      Section 3. The skin of the dog-fish is closely set with pointed  tooth-like scales, the placoid scales, and these are continued over  the lips into the mouth as teeth. Each scale consists of a base of true  bone, with a little tubercle of a harder substance, dentine, capped by  a still denser covering, the enamel. The enamel is derived from the  outer layer of the embryonic dog-fish, the epiblast, which also gives  rise to the epidermis; while the dentine and bony base arise in the  underlying mesoblast, the dermis. A mammalian tooth has  essentially the same structure: an outer coat of enamel, derived from  epiblast, overlies a mass of dentine, resting on bone, but the dentine  is excavated internally, to form a pulpcavity containing blood-vessels  and nerves. Most land animals, however, have teeth only in their  mouths, and have lost altogether the external teeth which constitute  the armour of the dog-fish. Besides the teeth there perhaps remain  relics of the placoid scales in the anatomy of the higher vertebrata, in  the membrane bones. How placoid scales may have given rise to  these structures will be understood by considering such a bone as  the vomer of the frog. This bone lies on the roof of the frog's mouth,  and bears a number of denticles, and altogether there is a very strong  resemblance in it to a number of placoid scales the bony bases of  which have become confluent. In the salamander, behind the  teeth-bearing vomers comes a similar toothed parasphenoid bone.  The same bone occurs in a corresponding position in the frog, but  without teeth. In some tailed amphibians the vomers and splenials are  known to arise by the fusion of small denticles. These facts seem to  point to stages in the fusion of placoid bases, and their withdrawal  from the surface to become incorporated with the cranial apparatus as  membrane bones, a process entirely completed in the mammalian  type.      Section 4. The alimentary canal of the dog-fish, is a simple tube  thrown into a Z shape. The mouth is rough with denticles, and has a  fleshy immovable tongue on its floor. In the position of the  Eustachian tube there is a passage, the spiracle (sp.), running out to  the exterior just external to the cartilage containing the ear. The  pharynx communicates with the exterior through five gill slits (g.s.),  and has, of course, no glottis or other lung opening. There is a wide  oesophagus passing into a U-shaped stomach (st.), having, like the  rabbit's, the spleen (sp.) on its outer curvature. There is no coiling  small intestine, but the short portion, receiving the bile duct (b.d.)  and duct of the pancreas (pan.), is called the duodenum (d'dum.). The  liver has large left (L.lv.) and right lobes, and a median lobe (M.lv.), in  which the gall bladder (g.bl.) is embedded. The next segment of the  intestine is fusiform, containing a spiral valve (Figure 4), the shelf of  which points steeply forward; it is sometimes called the colon (co.). It  is absorptive in function and probably represents morphologically, as  it does physiologically, the greater portion of the small intestine. A  rectal gland (r.g.) opens from the dorsal side into the final portion of  the canal (rectum).      Section 5. The circulation presents, in many respects, an  approximation to the state of affairs in the developing embryos of the  higher types. The heart (Figure 3, Sheet -14- {Error in First Edition}  [16]) is roughly, Z shape, and transmits only venous blood. It lies in a  cavity, the pericardial cavity (P.c.c.), cut off by a partition from the  general coelome. At one point this partition is imperfect, and the two  spaces communicate through a pericardio-peritoneal canal (p.p.c.),  which is also indicated by an arrow (p.p.) in the position and direction  in which the student, when dissecting, should thrust his \"seeker,\" in  Figure 1 Sheet 15. A sinus venosus (s.v. in Figure 3, Sheet 16)  receives the venous trunks, and carries the blood through a valve into  the baggy and transversely extended -auricle- [atrium] (au.), whence it  passes into the muscular ventricle (Vn.), and thence into the truncus  arteriosus. This truncus consists of two parts: the first, the conus or  pylangium (c.a.), muscular, contractile, and containing a series of  valves; the second, the bulbus or synangium (b.a.), without valves and  pulsatile. In the rabbit both sinus and truncus are absent, or merged in  the adjacent parts of the heart.      Section 6. From the bulbus there branch, on either side, four arterial  trunks, the first of which forks, so that altogether there are five  afferent branchials (a.br.) taking blood to be aerated in the gills, here  highly vascular filamentary outgrowths of the internal walls of the gill  slits.       {Lines from Second Edition only.}     [There are altogether nine vascular outgrowths (demi-branchs), one     on each wall of each gill slit except the last, on the hind wall of     which there is none. (In the spiracle is a miniature demibranch, the     pseudo-branch. This suggests that the spiracle is really a somewhat     modified gill slit.)]    Four efferent"]]]
