[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2442"],[0,"History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, (#19)"],[1,"ersy, is the  communication of the President notifying the Senate of the suspension of  Mr. Stanton, Aug. 12, 1867. The President said:    The Tenure-of-Office Act did not pass without notice. Like other acts,  it was sent to the President for approval. As is my custom I submitted  it to the consideration of my Cabinet for their advice whether I should  approve it or not. I was a grave question of constitutional law, in  which I would of course rely mostly upon the opinion of the Attorney  General, and of Mr. Stanton, who had once been Attorney General.  EVERY MEMBER OF MY CABINET ADVISED ME THAT THE PROPOSED LAW WAS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL. All spoke without doubt or reservation; but MR.  STANTON'S CONDEMNATION OF THE LAW WAS THE MOST ELABORATE AND EMPHATIC.  He referred to the Constitutional provisions, the debates in Congress,  especially to the speech of Mr. Buchanan when a Senator, to the  decisions of the Supreme Court, and to the usage from the beginning of  the Government through every successive administration, all concurring  to establish the right of removal as vested in the President. To all  these he added the weight of his own deliberate judgment, and advised me  that it was my duty to defend the power of the President from usurpation  and veto the law.    During the recess of Congress in the Summer of 1867, the President  suspended Mr. Stanton from the War Office and appointed Gen. Grant  Secretary of War ad interim. Gen. Grant was then understood as  supporting the President in his controversy with Mr. Stanton, and  promptly accepted the appointment, holding it until the following  December, when the change was duly reported to the Senate. The Senate  refused to sanction Mr. Stanton's suspension, and he consequently  resumed his position of Secretary of War and retained it until the close  of the Impeachment trial--the Senate then, in effect, by rejecting the  Impeachment, declaring that the President had the right to remove him.    Very naturally, after Mr. Stanton's restoration to the War Office by the  refusal of the Senate to sanction his suspension, the relations between  himself and the President were embittered and many efforts were made by  mutual friends to induce Mr. Stanton to resign. Conspicuous among these  were Gen. Grant, the General of the Army, and Gen. Sherman, the next in  rank, as shown in the following note from Gen. Sherman to the President;  but a few weeks before the crisis came. It explains itself, as showing  the relations then subsisting between the parties mentioned:    332 K St., Washington, Jan, 18th.    I regretted, this morning, to say that I had agreed to go down to  Annapolis, to spend Monday with Admiral Porter. Gen. Grant has to leave  for Richmond on Monday morning at 6 o'clock. At a conversation with the  General, after an interview wherein I offered to go with him on Monday  morning to Mr. Stanton and say it was our joint opinion that he should  resign, it was found impossible by reason of his going to Richmond and  my going to Annapolis. The General proposed this course. He will tell  you to-morrow and offer to go to Mr. Stanton to say that for the good  of the service of the country he ought to resign--this on Sunday. On  Monday, I will call on you, and if you think it necessary, I will do the  same--call on Mr. Stanton and tell him he should resign. If he will not,  then it will be time to consider ulterior measures. In the meantime, it  also happens that no necessity exists for precipitating measures.    Yours truly, W. T. Sherman.    On Saturday, February 23, 1868, the day following the removal of Mr.  Stanton, Mr. Johnson sent to the Senate the name of Mr. Thomas Ewing,  senior, of Ohio, as his successor. The Senate had adjourned for the day  when the President's Secretary reached the Capitol, between 12 and 1  o'clock, but the nomination was formally communicated on the following  Monday. Of this nomination, Mr. Blaine has written, that \"no name could  have given better assurance of good intentions and upright conduct than  that of Mr. Ewing. He was a man of lofty character, of great eminence in  his profession of the law, and with wide and varied experience in public  life. He had held high rank as a Senator in the Augustan period of  the Senate's learning and eloquence, and he had been one of the  ablest members of the distinguished Cabinets organized by the only two  Presidents elected by the Whig Party. He had reached the ripe age  of seventy-eight years, but still in complete possession of all his  splendid faculties. He had voted for Mr. Lincoln at both elections, had  been a warm supporter of the contest for the Union, and was represented  by his own blood on many of the great battlefields of the war.\"    No notice was taken by the Senate of this nomination.    Here was offered an opportunity for the settlement of the dispute over  the War Office on fair and honorable terms to all parties concerned. But  that was not what the impeachers wanted. They wanted to get Mr. Johnson  out. They thought they had a pretext that they could sustain by  making it a party question, and did not want a settlement on any other  terms--so no attention was given to Mr. Ewing's nomination. It was  ignored and the impeachment movement went on.        CHAPTER VI. --  IMPEACHMENT AGREED TO BY THE HOUSE.    Mr. Johnson's veto of the Tenure-of-Office Bill, and the passage of that  bill over his veto, of course intensified the antagonism between himself  and Congress. He not unnaturally regarded that Act as an infringement  of the Executive function which it was his duty to his office and to  himself to resent. The culmination came upon his official notification  to the Senate on February 21st, 1868, of his removal of Mr. Stanton  from the office of Secretary of War, and his appointment of Gen.  Lorenzo Thomas as Secretary ad interim, nothwithstanding the assumed  interdiction of the Tenure-of-Office Act.    Immediately on receipt of this notification, the Senate went into  executive session, and the following proceeding was had:    IN EXECUTIVE SESSION Senate of the United States February 21st, 1868    Whereas, The Senate have read and considered the communication of the  President, stating that he had removed Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary  of War, and had designated the Adjutant General of the Army to act as  Secretary of War ad interim. interim... Therefore,    Resolved, by the Senate of the United States, That under the  Constitution and laws of the United States, the President has no power  to remove the Secretary of War and designate any other officer to  perform the duties of that office ad interim.    The journal of the Senate shows that this Resolution was adopted by the  following vote:    Yeas--Messrs. Cameron, Cattell, Cole, Conkling, Cragin, Drake, Ferry,  Harlan, Morrill of Maine, Morrill of Vermont, Morton, Patterson of New  Hampshire, Pomeroy, Ramsay, Ross, Sprague, Stewart. Sumner. Thayer,  Tipton, Trumbull. Van Winkle, Wade, Willey Williams. Wilson. Yates--23.    Nays--Messrs. Buckalew, Davis, Doolittle, Edmunds, Hendricks, Patterson  of Tennessee--6.    Absent or not voting--20. Note. (Note--It is due to myself to say here,  that the entry of my name in the above vote, was incorrect. My distinct  recollection is, that though present, I declined to vote, and from the  consideration mentioned. I was totally unaware of my name being recorded  as voting on the proposition until long after I left the Senate, when of  course there was no opportunity to secure a correction of the journal.)    This was an extraordinary proceeding. A proposition to impeach the  President had till recently been pending in the House for nearly a year,  and the ingenuity of the majority had been taxed to the utmost to find  some basis for an indictment upon which a successful impeachment might  be possible. There is ground for the suggestion that much was hoped for  in that direction from the Tenure-of-Office Bill, at least so far as the  House was concerned. That hoped for opportunity had now come--nor is  it an unreasonable surmise, that this very extraordinary action of  the Senate was forced by outside as well as inside influences for the  purpose of testing the Senate, and committing it in advance and in  anticipation of the preferment of another impeachment by the House.    As to the question of the guilt or innocence of the President of the  commission of an impeachable offense, this vote of the Senate was in  the nature of a vote of \"guilty.\" It was therefore to a degree an  impeachment and conviction combined by the Senate, prior to the bringing  of an accusation by the House of Representatives, the constitutional  body for the preferment of an impeachment of the President--and was an  improper, and not far removed from an indecent proceeding on the part of  the Senate. In effect, the President was thereby condemned by the  Senate without trial, and his later arraignment was simply to receive  sentence-it being solely upon the removal of Mr. Stanton that the  impeachment was brought by the House.    It is noticeable, and possibly indicative, that the names of twenty out  of fifty-four members of the Senate do not appear in this list--a very  unusual occurrence in divisions of that body; especially in the exciting  conditions that then prevailed. The absentees, or at least abstentions  from voting, were fifteen Republicans and five Democrats, more than  one-third of the body. That very unusual absence or abstention from  voting may well be attributed to the very proper hesitancy of Senators  to commit themselves in advance, either way, on a proposition that was  reasonably certain to lead to an impeachment of the President, then  virtually pending and imminent in the House, and upon which the Senate  was equally certain to be called upon to act.    The action of the President was also communicated to the House of  Representatives by Mr. Stanton, at the same hour of the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#19)"],[1,"witnesses, who recognize it as Spaulding's, he having told them that he  had altered his first plan of writing, by going further back with dates,  and writing in the old scripture style, in order that it might appear  more ancient. They say that it bears no resemblance to the 'Manuscript  Found.'\"    If Howe had considered this manuscript of the least importance  as invalidating the testimony showing the resemblance between the  \"Manuscript Found\" and the Mormon Bible, he would have destroyed it (if  he was the malignant falsifier the Mormons represented him to be), and  not have first described it in his book; and then left it to be found  by any future owner of his effects. Its rediscovery has been accepted,  however, even by some non-Mormons, as proof that the Mormon Bible is an  original production.*         * Preface to \"The Mormon Prophet,\" Lily Dugall.      Mrs. Ellen E. Dickenson, a great-niece of Spaulding, who has  painstakingly investigated the history of the much-discussed manuscript,  visited D. P. Hurlbut at his home near Gibsonburg, Ohio, in 1880 (he  died in 1882), taking with her Oscar Kellogg, a lawyer, as a witness to  the interview.* She says that her visit excited him greatly. He told of  getting a manuscript for Mr. Howe at Hartwick, and said he thought  it was burned with other of Mr. Howe's papers. When asked, \"Was it  Spaulding's manuscript that was burned?\" he replied: \"Mrs. Davison  thought it was; but when I just peeked into it, here and there, and  saw the names Mormon, Moroni, Lamanite, Lephi, I thought it was all  nonsense. Why, if it had been the real one, I could have sold it for  $3000;** but I just gave it to Howe because it was of no account.\"  During the interview his wife was present, and when Mrs. Dickenson  pressed him with the question, \"Do you know where the 'Manuscript Found'  is at the present time?\" Mrs. Hurlbut went up to him and said, \"Tell  her what you know.\" She got no satisfactory answer, but he afterward  forwarded to her an affidavit saying that he had obtained of Mrs.  Davison a manuscript supposing it to be Spaulding's \"Manuscript Found,\"  adding: \"I did not examine the manuscript until after I got home, when  upon examination I found it to contain nothing of the kind, but being  a manuscript upon an entirely different subject. This manuscript I left  with E. D. Howe.\"    With this presentation of the evidence showing the similarity between  Spaulding's story and the Mormon Bible narrative, we may next examine  the grounds for believing that Sidney Rigdon was connected with the  production of the Bible.         * A full account of this interview is given in her book, \"New  Light on Mormonism\" (1885).         ** There have been surmises that Hurlbut also found the  \"Manuscript Found\" in the trunk and sold this to the Mormons. He sent a  specific denial of this charge to Robert Patterson in 1879.        CHAPTER VIII. -- SIDNEY RIGDON    The man who had more to do with founding the Mormon church than Joseph  Smith, Jr., even if we exclude any share in the production of the Mormon  Bible, and yet who is unknown even by name to most persons to whom the  names of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young are familiar, was Sidney Rigdon.  Elder John Hyde, Jr., was well within the truth when he wrote: \"The  compiling genius of Mormonism was Sidney Rigdon. Smith had boisterous  impetuosity but no foresight. Polygamy was not the result of his  policy but of his passions. Sidney gave point, direction, and apparent  consistency to the Mormon system of theology. He invented its forms and  the manner of its arguments.... Had it not been for the accession of  these two men [Rigdon and Parley P. Pratt] Smith would have been lost,  and his schemes frustrated and abandoned.\"*         * \"Mormonism: Its Leaders and Designs\" (1857). Hyde, an  Englishman, joined the Mormons in that country when a lad and began to  preach almost at once. He sailed for this country in 1853 and joined the  brethren in Salt Lake City. Brigham Young's rule upset his faith, and he  abandoned the belief in 1854. Even H. H. Bancroft concedes him to have  been \"an able and honest man, sober and sincere.\"    Rigdon (according to the sketch of him presented in Smith's  autobiography,* which he doubtless wrote) was born in St. Clair  township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 1793. His  father was a farmer, and he lived on the farm, receiving only a limited  education, until he was twenty-six years old. He then connected himself  with the Baptist church, and received a license to preach. Selecting  Ohio as his field, he continued his work in rural districts in that  state until 1821, when he accepted a call to a small Baptist church in  Pittsburg.         * Millennial Star, Vol. XIV, Supt.      Twenty years before the publication of the Mormon Bible, Thomas and  Alexander Campbell, Scotchmen, had founded a congregation in Washington  County, Pennsylvania, out of which grew the religious denomination  known as Disciples of Christ, or Campbellites, whose communicants in  the United States numbered 871,017 in the year 1890. The fundamental  principle of their teaching was that every doctrine of belief, or  maxim of duty, must rest upon the authority of Scripture, expressed or  implied, all human creeds being rejected. The Campbells (who had been  first Presbyterians and then Baptists) were wonderful orators and  convincing debaters out of the pulpit, and they drew to themselves many  of the most eloquent exhorters in what was then the western border of  the United States. Among their allies was another Scotchman, Walter  Scott, a musician and schoolteacher by profession, who assisted them  in their newspaper work and became a noted evangelist in their  denomination. During a visit to Pittsburg in 1823, Scott made Rigdon's  acquaintance, and a little later the flocks to which each preached  were united. In August, 1824, Rigdon announced his withdrawal from his  church. Regarding his withdrawal the sketch in Smith's autobiography  says:--    \"After he had been in that place [Pittsburg] some time, his mind was  troubled and much perplexed with the idea that the doctrines maintained  by that society were not altogether in accordance with the Scriptures.  This thing continued to agitate his mind more and more, and his  reflections on these occasions were particularly trying; for, according  to his view of the word of God, no other church with whom he could  associate, or that he was acquainted with, was right; consequently,  if he was to disavow the doctrine of the church with whom he was then  associated, he knew of no other way of obtaining a living, except by  manual labor, and at that time he had a wife and three children to  support.\"    For two years after he gave up his church connection he worked as a  journeyman tanner. This is all the information obtainable about this  part of his life. We next find him preaching at Bainbridge, Ohio, as  an undenominational exhorter, but following the general views of the  Campbells, advising his hearers to reject their creeds and rest their  belief solely on the Bible.    In June, 1826, Rigdon received a call to a Baptist church at Mentor,  Ohio, whose congregation he had pleased when he preached the funeral  sermon of his predecessor. His labors were not confined, however, to  this congregation. We find him acting as the \"stated\" minister of a  Disciples' church organized at Mantua, Ohio, in 1827, preaching with  Thomas Campbell at Shalersville, Ohio, in 1828, and thus extending the  influence he had acquired as early as 1820, when Alexander Campbell  called him \"the great orator of the Mahoning Association\". In 1828 he  visited his old associate Scott, was further confirmed in his faith in  the Disciples' belief, and, taking his brother-in-law Bentley back with  him, they began revival work at Mentor, which led to the conversion of  more than fifty of their hearers. They held services at Kirtland, Ohio,  with equal success, and the story of this awakening was the main subject  of discussion in all the neighborhood round about. The sketch of Rigdon  in Smith's autobiography closes with this tribute to his power as a  preacher: \"The churches where he preached were no longer large enough  to contain the vast assemblies. No longer did he follow the old beaten  track,... but dared to enter on new grounds,... threw new light on the  sacred volume,... proved to a demonstration the literal fulfilment of  prophecy...and the reign of Christ with his Saints on the earth in the  Millennium.\"    In tracing Rigdon's connection with Smith's enterprise, attention must  be carefully paid both to Rigdon's personal characteristics, and to the  resemblance between the doctrines he had taught in the pulpit and those  that appear in the Mormon Bible.    Rigdon's mental and religious temperament was just of the character  to be attracted by a novelty in religious belief. He, with his  brother-in-law, Adamson Bentley, visited Alexander Campbell in 1821, and  spent a whole night in religious discussion. When they parted the next  day, Rigdon declared that \"if he had within the last year promulgated  one error, he had a thousand,\" and Mr. Campbell, in his account of the  interview, remarked, \"I found it expedient to caution them not to begin  to pull down anything they had builded until they had reviewed, again  and again, what they had heard; not even then rashly and without much  consideration.\"*         * Millennial Harbinger, 1848, p. 523.      A leading member of the church at Mantua has written, \"Sidney Rigdon  preached for us, and, notwithstanding his extravagantly wild freaks, he  was held in high repute by many.\"*         * \"Early History of the Disciples' Church in the Western  Reserve,\" by A: S. Hayden (1876), p. 239.      An important church discussion occurred at Warren, Ohio, in 1828.  Following out the idea of the literal interpretation of the Scriptures  taught in"]]]
