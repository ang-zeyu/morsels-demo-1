In these institutions  his will is broken, his soul degraded, his spirit subdued by the  deadly monotony and routine of prison life.  In Ohio, Illinois,  Pennsylvania, Missouri, and in the South, these horrors have become  so flagrant as to reach the outside world, while in most other  prisons the same Christian methods still prevail.  But prison walls  rarely allow the agonized shrieks of the victims to escape--prison  walls are thick, they dull the sound.  Society might with greater  immunity abolish all prisons at once, than to hope for protection  from these twentieth century chambers of horrors.    Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an  emaciated, deformed, willless, ship-wrecked crew of humanity, with  the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their  natural inclinations thwarted.  With nothing but hunger and  inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as  the only possibility of existence.  It is not at all an unusual thing  to find men and women who have spent half their lives--nay, almost  their entire existence--in prison.  I know a woman on Blackwell's  Island, who had been in and out thirty-eight times; and through a  friend I learn that a young boy of seventeen, whom he had nursed and  cared for in the Pittsburg penitentiary, had never known the meaning  of liberty.  From the reformatory to the penitentiary had been the  path of this boy's life, until, broken in body, he died a victim of  social revenge.  These personal experiences are substantiated by  extensive data giving overwhelming proof of the utter futility of  prisons as a means of deterrence or reform.    Well-meaning persons are now working for a new departure in the  prison question,--reclamation, to restore once more to the prisoner  the possibility of becoming a human being.  Commendable as this is, I  fear it is impossible to hope for good results from pouring good wine  into a musty bottle.  Nothing short of a complete reconstruction of  society will deliver mankind from the cancer of crime.  Still, if the  dull edge of our social conscience would be sharpened, the penal  institutions might be given a new coat of varnish.  But the first  step to be taken is the renovation of the social consciousness, which  is in a rather dilapidated condition.  It is sadly in need to be  awakened to the fact that crime is a question of degree, that we all  have the rudiments of crime in us, more or less, according to our  mental, physical, and social environment; and that the individual  criminal is merely a reflex of the tendencies of the aggregate.      With the social consciousness awakened, the average individual may  learn to refuse the \"honor\" of being the bloodhound of the law.  He  may cease to persecute, despise, and mistrust the social offender,  and give him a chance to live and breathe among his fellows.  Institutions are, of course, harder to reach.  They are cold,  impenetrable, and cruel; still, with the social consciousness  quickened, it might be possible to free the prison victims from the  brutality of prison officials, guards, and keepers.  Public opinion  is a powerful weapon; keepers of human prey, even, are afraid of it.  They may be taught a little humanity, especially if they realize that  their jobs depend upon it.      But the most important step is to demand for the prisoner the right  to work while in prison, with some monetary recompense that would  enable him to lay aside a little for the day of his release, the  beginning of a new life.    It is almost ridiculous to hope much from present society when we  consider that workingmen, wage slaves themselves, object to convict  labor.  I shall not go into the cruelty of this objection, but merely  consider the impracticability of it.  To begin with, the opposition  so far raised by organized labor has been directed against windmills.  Prisoners have always worked; only the State has been their  exploiter, even as the individual employer has been the robber of  organized labor.  The States have either set the convicts to work for  the government, or they have farmed convict labor to private  individuals.  Twenty-nine of the States pursue the latter plan.  The  Federal government and seventeen States have discarded it, as have  the leading nations of Europe, since it leads to hideous overworking  and abuse of prisoners, and to endless graft.    Rhode Island, the State dominated by Aldrich, offers perhaps the  worst example.  Under a five-year contract, dated July 7th, 1906, and  renewable for five years more at the option of private contractors,  the labor of the inmates of the Rhode Island Penitentiary and the  Providence County Jail is sold to the Reliance-Sterling Mfg. Co. at  the rate of a trifle less than 25 cents a day per man.  This Company  is really a gigantic Prison Labor Trust, for it also leases the  convict labor of Connecticut, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, and South  Dakota penitentiaries, and the reformatories of New Jersey, Indiana,  Illinois, and Wisconsin, eleven establishments in all.    The enormity of the graft under the Rhode Island contract may be  estimated from the fact that this same Company pays 62 1/2 cents a  day in Nebraska for the convict's labor, and that Tennessee, for  example, gets $1.10 a day for a convict's work from the Gray-Dudley  Hardware Co.; Missouri gets 70 cents a day from the Star Overall Mfg.  Co.; West Virginia 65 cents a day from the Kraft Mfg. Co., and  Maryland 55 cents a day from Oppenheim, Oberndorf & Co., shirt  manufacturers.  The very difference in prices points to enormous  graft.  For example, the Reliance-Sterling Mfg. Co. manufactures  shirts, the cost of free labor being not less than $1.20 per dozen,  while it pays Rhode Island thirty cents a dozen.  Furthermore, the  State charges this Trust no rent for the use of its huge factory,  charges nothing for power, heat, light, or even drainage, and exacts  no taxes.  What graft!    It is estimated that more than twelve million dollars' worth of  workingmen's shirts and overalls is produced annually in this country  by prison labor.  It is a woman's industry, and the first reflection  that arises is that an immense amount of free female labor is thus  displaced.  The second consideration is that male convicts, who  should be learning trades that would give them some chance of being  self-supporting after their release, are kept at this work at which  they can not possibly make a dollar.  This is the more serious when  we consider that much of this labor is done in reformatories, which  so loudly profess to be training their inmates to become useful  citizens.    The third, and most important, consideration is that the enormous  profits thus wrung from convict labor are a constant incentive to the  contractors to exact from their unhappy victims tasks altogether  beyond their strength, and to punish them cruelly when their work  does not come up to the excessive demands made.    Another word on the condemnation of convicts to tasks at which they  cannot hope to make a living after release.  Indiana, for example, is  a State that has made a great splurge over being in the front rank of  modern penological improvements.  Yet, according to the report  rendered in 1908 by the training school of its \"reformatory,\" 135  were engaged in the manufacture of chains, 207 in that of shirts, and  255 in the foundry--a total of 597 in three occupations.  But at this  so-called reformatory 59 occupations were represented by the inmates,  39 of which were connected with country pursuits.  Indiana, like  other States, professes to be training the inmates of her reformatory  to occupations by which they will be able to make their living when  released.  She actually sets them to work making chains, shirts, and  brooms, the latter for the benefit of the Louisville Fancy Grocery  Co.  Broom making is a trade largely monopolized by the blind, shirt  making is done by women, and there is only one free chain factory in  the State, and at that a released convict can not hope to get  employment.  The whole thing is a cruel farce.    If, then, the States can be instrumental in robbing their helpless  victims of such tremendous profits, is it not high time for organized  labor to stop its idle howl, and to insist on decent remuneration for  the convict, even as labor organizations claim for themselves?  In  that way workingmen would kill the germ which makes of the prisoner  an enemy to the interests of labor.  I have said elsewhere that  thousands of convicts, incompetent and without a trade, without means  of subsistence, are yearly turned back into the social fold.  These  men and women must live, for even an ex-convict has needs.  Prison  life has made them anti-social beings, and the rigidly closed doors  that meet them on their release are not likely to decrease their  bitterness.  The inevitable result is that they form a favorable  nucleus out of which scabs, blacklegs, detectives, and policemen are  drawn, only too willing to do the master's bidding.  Thus organized  labor, by its foolish opposition to work in prison, defeats its own  ends.  It helps to create poisonous fumes that stifle every attempt  for economic betterment.  If the workingman wants to avoid these  effects, he should INSIST on the right of the convict to work, he  should meet him as a brother, take him into his organization, and  WITH HIS AID TURN AGAINST THE SYSTEM WHICH GRINDS THEM BOTH.      Last, but not least, is the growing realization of the barbarity and  the inadequacy of the definite sentence.

He collected  what in those times was deemed a respectable library, and bequeathed no  less than sixty or seventy volumes to the Durham monks, including his  great Bible, which has ever since been preserved with religious care;  from a catalogue of them we learn his partiality for classical  literature; a Tully, Sedulus, Priscian, and Claudius, are mentioned among  them.[167]    Anthony Bek, who was appointed to the see in the year 1283, was a most  ambitious and haughty prelate, and caused great dissensions in his  church. History proves how little he was adapted for the responsible  duties of a bishop, and points to the field of battle or civil pomp as  most congenial to his disposition. He ostentatiously displayed the  splendor of a Palatine Prince, when he contributed his powerful aid to  the cause of his sovereign, in the Scottish war, by a retinue of 500  horse, 1000 foot, 140 knights, and 26 standard bearers,[168] rendered  doubly imposing in those days of saintly worship and credulity, by the  patronage of St. Cuthbert, under whole holy banner they marched against a  brave and noble foe. His arbitrary temper caused sad quarrels in the  cloister, which ultimately gave rise to a tedious law proceeding between  him and the prior about the year 1300;[169] from a record of this affair  we learn that the bishop had borrowed some books from the library which  afterwards he refused to return; there was among them a Decretal, a  history of England, a Missal, and a volume called \"The book of St.  Cuthbert, in which the secrets of the monastery are written,\" which was  alone valued at L200,[170] probably in consideration of the important and  delicate matters contained therein.    These proceedings were instituted by prior Hoton, who was fond of books,  and had a great esteem for learning; he founded a college at Oxford for  the monkish students of his church.[171] On more than one occasion he  sent parcels of books to Oxford; in a list of an early date it appears  that the monks of Durham sent at one time twenty volumes, and shortly  after fifteen more, consisting principally of church books and lives of  saints.[172] The numbers thus taken from their library the monks, with  that love of learning for which they were so remarkable, anxiously  replaced, by purchasing about twenty volumes, many of which contained a  great number of small but choice pieces.[173]    Robert de Graystane, a monk of Durham, was elected bishop by the prior  and chapter, and confirmed on the 10th of November, 1333, but the king,  Edward III., wishing to advance his treasurer to that see, refused his  sanction to the proceeding; monk Robert was accordingly deposed, and  Richard Angraville received the mitre in his stead. He was consecrated on  the 19th of December in the same year, by John Stratford, archbishop of  Canterbury, and installed by proxy on the 10th of January, 1334.    Angraville, Aungerville, or as he is more commonly called Richard de  Bury, is a name which every bibliophile will honor and esteem; he was  indeed a bibliomaniac of the first order, and a sketch of his life is not  only indispensable here, but cannot fail to interest the book-loving  reader. But before entering more at large into his bookish propensities  and talents, it will be necessary to say something of his early days and  the illustrious career which attended his political and ecclesiastical  life. Richard de Bury, the son of Sir Richard Angraville, was born, as  his name implies, at Bury St. Edmunds, in Suffolk, in the year 1287.[174]    Great attention was paid to the instruction of his youthful mind by his  maternal uncle, John de Willowby, a priest, previous to his removal to  Oxford. At the university he obtained honorable distinction, as much for  his erudition and love of books as for the moral rectitude of his  behavior. These pleasing traits were the stepping stones to his future  greatness, and on the strength of them he was selected as one fully  competent to undertake the education of Edward Prince of Wales,  afterwards the third king of that name; and to Richard de Bury \"may be  traced the love for literature and the arts displayed by his pupil when  on the throne. He was rewarded with the lucrative appointment of  treasurer of Gascony.\"[175]    When Edward, the prince of Wales, was sent to Paris to assume the  dominion of Guienne, which the king had resigned in his favor, he was  accompanied by queen Isabella, his mother, whose criminal frailty, and  afterwards conspiracy, with Mortimer, aroused the just indignation of her  royal husband; and commenced those civil dissensions which rendered the  reign of Edward II. so disastrous and turbulent. It was during these  commotions that Richard de Bury became a zealous partizan of the queen,  to whom he fled, and ventured to supply her pecuniary necessities from  the royal revenues; for this, however, he was surrounded with imminent  danger; for the king, instituting an inquiry into these proceedings,  attempted his capture, which he narrowly escaped by secreting himself in  the belfry of the convent of Brothers Minor at Paris.[176]    When the \"most invincible and most magnificent king\" Edward III. was  firmly seated upon the throne, dignity and power was lavishly bestowed on  this early bibliomaniac. In an almost incredible space of time he was  appointed cofferer to the king, treasurer of the wardrobe, archdeacon of  Northampton, prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, Litchfield, and shortly  afterwards keeper of the privy seal, which office he held for five years.  During this time he twice undertook a visit to Italy, on a mission to the  supreme pontiff, John XXII., who not only entertained him with honor and  distinction, but appointed him chaplain to his principal chapel, and gave  him a bull, nominating him to the first vacant see in England.    He acquired whilst there an honor which reflected more credit than even  the smiles of his holiness--the brightest of the Italian poets, Petrarch  of never dying fame--bestowed upon him his acquaintance and lasting  friendship. De Bury entered Avignon for the first time in the same year  that Petrarch took up his residence there, in the house of Colonna,  bishop of Lombes: two such enlightened scholars and indefatigable book  collectors, sojourning in the same city, soon formed an intimacy.[177]  How interesting must their friendly meetings have been, and how  delightful the hours spent in Petrarch's library, which was one of great  extent and rarity; and it is probable too that De Bury obtained from the  poet a few treasures to enrich his own stores; for the generosity of  Petrarch was so excessive, that he could scarcely withhold what he knew  was so dearly coveted. His benevolence on one occasion deprived him and  posterity of an inestimable volume; he lent some manuscripts of the  classics to his old master, who, needing pecuniary aid, pawned them, and  Cicero's books, _De Gloria_, were in this manner irrecoverably lost.[178]  Petrarch acted like a true lover of learning; for when the shadows of old  age approached, he presented his library, full of rare and ancient  manuscripts, many of them enriched by his own notes, to the Venetian  Senate, and thus laid the foundation of the library of Saint-Marc; he  always employed a number of transcribers, who invariably accompanied him  on his journeys, and he kept horses to carry his books.[179] His love of  reading was intense. \"Whether,\" he writes in one of his epistles, \"I am  being shaved, or having my hair cut, whether I am riding on horseback or  taking my meals, I either read myself or get some one to read to me; on  the table where I dine, and by the side of my bed, I have all the  materials for writing.\"[180] With the friendship of such a student, how  charming must have been the visit of the English ambassador, and how much  valuable and interesting information must he have gleaned by his  intercourse with Petrarch and his books. At Rome Richard de Bury obtained  many choice volumes and rare old manuscripts of the classics; for at Rome  indeed, at that time, books had become an important article of commerce,  and many foreign collectors besides the English bibliomaniac resorted  there for these treasures: to such an extend was this carried on, that  the jealousy of Petrarch was aroused, who, in addressing the Romans,  exclaims: \"Are you not ashamed that the wrecks of your ancient grandeur,  spared by the inundation of the barbarians, are daily sold by your  miscalculating avarice to foreigners? And that Rome is no where less  known and less loved than at Rome?\"[181]    The immense ecclesiastical and civil revenues which Aungraville enjoyed,  enabled him whilst in Italy to maintain a most costly and sumptuous  establishment: in his last visit alone he is said to have expended 5,000  marks, and he never appeared in public without a numerous retinue of  twenty clerks and thirty-six esquires; an appearance which better became  the dignity of his civil office, than the Christian humility of his  ecclesiastical functions. On his return from this distinguished sojourn,  he was appointed, as we have said before, through the instrumentality of  Edward III., to the bishopric of Durham. But not content with these high  preferments, his royal master advanced him to still greater honor, and on  the 28th of September, 1334, he was made Lord Chancellor of England,  which office he filled till the 5th of June, 1335, when he exchanged it  for that of high treasurer. He was twice appointed ambassador to the king  of France, respecting the claims of Edward of England to the crown of  that country. De Bury, whilst negociating this affair, visited Antwerp  and Brabant for the furtherance of the object of"]]]
