There remains but one of the brothers who gave Peru to Spain, the  magnificent cavalier, Gonzalo.  His fate may be briefly summarized.  Another Viceroy, named Blasco Nunez Vela, succeeded De Castro.  He had  orders to release the Peruvians from servitude, which meant that the  conquerors and the thousands who had come after, would have been  compelled to work.  Led by Gonzalo, who had been rewarded for his  services in the rebellion against Almagro by a domain in Peru which  included the newly discovered mines of Potosi, which provided him with  the sinews of war, the people rebelled against the Viceroy.  Pizarro  and his lieutenant, Carvajal, deposed and defeated the Viceroy in a  battle near Quito on the 18th of January, 1546, the latter losing his  life.    Gonzalo Pizarro was now the supreme lord of Peru, which included  practically the whole of the South American coast from the Isthmus of  Darien to the Straits of Magellan, for Valdivia, one of Francisco  Pizarro's lieutenants, had partially conquered Chili at last.    The Spanish monarch, three thousand miles away, {110} could do nothing  by force.  He sent an able and devoted ecclesiastic, Gasca by name,  clothing him with dictatorial powers, to see what he could do.  Gasca  arrived at Panama, cunningly and tactfully won the captains of  Gonzalo's navy to his side, went to Peru, assembled a force, and  although Centeno, one of his lieutenants, was badly defeated by Gonzalo  and Carvajal on the 26th of October, 1547, at Huarina, the bloodiest  battle ever fought in Peru, finally gained strength enough to march to  Cuzco, where Gonzalo had command of a large and splendidly equipped  army.  Gasca, by promising that the obnoxious laws concerning the  Indians should be repealed, and adroitly pointing out that those who  adhered to Gonzalo were, in effect, in rebellion against their  sovereign, had so undermined the allegiance of his men that Gonzalo,  who had marched to the Valley of Xaquixaguana, found himself deserted  on the eve of the battle by all but a handful of faithful retainers.    \"What shall we do?\" asked one of the devoted followers.    \"Fall on them and die like Romans.\"    \"I believe I should prefer to die like a Christian,\" said Gonzalo  calmly.    Recognizing that it was all up with him, riding forward with Carvajal  and the rest, he coolly surrendered himself to Gasca.    Carvajal was hung, drawn and quartered.    Gonzalo, the last of the brothers, was beheaded in the great square at  Cuzco.  He was magnificently arrayed as he rode to his death.  His vast  estates, including the mines of Potosi, had been confiscated and all  his possessions were on his back.  He met his fate with the courage of  the family.  Before he {111} died he made a little address from the  scaffold.  Contrasting his present poverty with his former state, he  asked those who had been his friends and who owed him anything, and  also those who had been his enemies, to lay out some of the treasure  they had gained through his family and himself in masses for the repose  of his soul.  Then he knelt down before a table bearing a crucifix, and  prayed silently.  At last he turned to the executioner and said:    \"Do your duty with a steady hand!\"    So he made a rather dramatic and picturesque exit there in the square  at Cuzco, on that sunny morning in April, 1548.  His head was exhibited  at Lima with that of Carvajal.  To it was attached this inscription:    \"This is the head of the traitor, Gonzalo Pizarro, who rebelled in Peru  against his sovereign and battled against the royal standard at the  Valley of Xaquixaguana.\"    There remains but one other person whose fate excites a passing  interest, unless it be Bishop Valverde, who was killed, while on a  journey, by the Peruvians, some years before; this is the last Inca,  Manco Capac.  When De Rada and his band started out to assassinate  Pizarro, one of the soldiers, named Gomez Perez, made a detour as they  crossed the square, to keep from getting his feet wet in a puddle of  muddy water which had overflowed from one of the conduits.    \"You shrink,\" cried De Rada, in contempt, \"from wetting your feet, who  are about to wade in the blood of the governor!  Go back, we will have  none of you.\"    He had not permitted Perez to take part in the assassination.  This  Perez, after the final defeat of the Almagrists, fled to the mountains  where Manco still exercised a fugitive sway over such of his people  {112} as could escape the Spaniards.  He was afterward pardoned and  used as a medium of communication between Gasca and the Inca.  The  priest viceroy was anxious to be at peace with the Inca, but Manco  refused to trust himself to the Spaniards.    Perez and he were playing bowls one day in the mountains.  Perez either  cheated, or in some way incensed the unfortunate Inca, who peremptorily  reproved him, whereupon the Spaniard, in a fit of passion, hurled his  heavy stone bowl at the last of the Incas, and killed him.  That was  the end of Perez, also, for the attendants of the young Inca stabbed  him to death.    Thus all those who had borne a prominent part in the great adventures  had gone to receive such certain reward as they merited; which reward  was not counted out to them in the form of gold and silver, or stones  of price.  The sway in the new land of the king over the sea was  absolute at last, and there was peace, such as it was, in Peru.        [1] \"What is this, Francisco Pizarro?\" Balboa asked, in great  astonishment, of his former lieutenant and comrade, meeting him and his  soldiers on the way with the order of arrest.  \"You were not wont to  come out in this fashion to receive me!\"    [2] Magellan had crossed it from the south five years before.    [3] Prescott, to whose remarkable accuracy, considering the time in  which he wrote, the authorities at his command, and the disabilities  under which he labored, I am glad to testify, in view of the prevalent  opinion that his books are literature and not history, says thirteen;  Helps says fifteen, while Markham and Fiske say sixteen.  Kirk verifies  Prescott's conclusion with a good argument.  One thing there is to  which no one but Prescott seems to have called attention or explained.  Everybody says Ruiz, the old pilot, was the first to follow Pizarro  across the line.  If so, he must have stepped back again, probably at  Pizarro's request, for six months later we find him leaving Panama in  charge of the ship which took Pizarro and his devoted subordinates off  the Island of Gorgona.  Ruiz could only have reached Panama in Tafur's  ship.  Certain it is that only thirteen men were ennobled for their  heroic constancy on the Island of Gallo, as we shall see later.  The  three names added to Prescott's list are put there on the authority of  Garcilasso de la Vega, the son of a Spanish cavalier and an Inca  princess.  Two of the three men he mentions he claims told him  personally that they had been of the heroic band which had refused to  abandon Pizarro.  Such claims made by men who may really believe them  to be true after the event, are not rare in history.    Whatever the exact number, there were but a handful.  The rest,  choosing Panama, remained on the north side of the line, and I have no  doubt regretted their decision for the rest of their lives.    [4] Generally speaking, the Peruvians were monogamous, except in case  of the Inca, who had as many wives as he wished, and who sometimes  rewarded exceptional services by allowing some favored adherent an  extra wife.    [5] The exact number varies with different authorities, none of whom,  however, makes the total greater than two hundred.    [6] Napoleon at Toulon succeeded in getting volunteers to man a  particularly dangerous artillery outpost swept by the guns of the  enemy, by the simple expedient of denominating the position as the  \"Battery of the Fearless,\" or the \"Battery of those who are not  afraid.\"  Even better than Pizarro, this great Corsican soldier of  fortune knew how to handle his men.    [7] Authorities differ as to which it was.  The matter is not material,  anyway.    [8] The ransom of King John II. of France, taken prisoner by the Black  Prince, was three million golden crowns.  The value of the ancient ecu  de la couronne varied between $1.50 and $1.30, so that the ransom of  John was between four and one-half and seven million dollars.  Estimating the purchasing power of money in John's time at two and  one-half times that of the present, we arrive at a ransom of between  eleven and eighteen million dollars.  If we split the difference and  call the ransom fourteen and a half millions, we still find that the  Christian monarch was slightly undervalued as compared with his heathen  fellow in misery.  However, all this is profitless, because the ransom  of John was never paid.    [9] Query: Does the reader not wish that the Peruvians had succeeded?  Indeed, how can the reader help wishing that?  Yet would it have been  better for the world if the Peruvians had succeeded in expelling the  Spaniards, or would it have been worse?  These questions afford matter  for interesting speculation.          {115}    IV    The Greatest Adventure in History      I. The Chief of all the Soldiers of Fortune    At the close of the fifteenth century, to be exact, in the year 1500,  in the town of Painala, in the Province of Coatzacualco, one of the  feudatory divisions of the great Aztec empire of Mexico, there was born  a young girl who was destined to exercise upon the fortunes of her  country an influence as great as it was baleful, as wonderful as it was  unfortunate.  She was the daughter of the Cacique of Tenepal, who was  Lord of the town and province, a feoff of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],[0,"The Daffodil Mystery (#19)"],[1,"Lyne, and even more so because his own revolver had been found  on the scene of the tragedy, the object of some suspicion on the part of  the higher authorities who certainly would not pooh-pooh the suggestion  that he was innocent of any association with the crime because he  happened to be engaged in the case.    He knew that the whole complex machinery of Scotland Yard was working,  and working at top speed, to implicate him in the tragedy. Silent and  invisible though that work may be, it would nevertheless be sure. He  smiled a little, and shrugged himself from the category of the suspected.    First and most important of the suspects was Odette Rider. That Thornton  Lyne had loved her, he did not for one moment imagine. Thornton Lyne was  not the kind of man who loved. Rather had he desired, and very few women  had thwarted him. Odette Rider was an exception. Tarling only knew of the  scene which had occurred between Lyne and the girl on the day he had been  called in, but there must have been many other painful interviews,  painful for the girl, humiliating for the dead millionaire.    Anyway, he thought thankfully, it would not be Odette. He had got into  the habit of thinking of her as \"Odette,\" a discovery which had amused  him. He could rule her out, because obviously she could not be in two  places at once. When Thornton Lyne was discovered in Hyde Park, with  Odette Rider's night-dress round about his wound, the girl herself was  lying in a cottage hospital at Ashford fifty miles away.    But what of Milburgh, that suave and oily man? Tarling recalled the fact  that he had been sent for by his dead relative to inquire into Milburgh's  mode of living and that Milburgh was under suspicion of having robbed the  firm. Suppose Milburgh had committed the crime? Suppose, to hide his  defalcations, he had shot his employer dead? There was a flaw in this  reasoning because the death of Thornton Lyne would be more likely to  precipitate the discovery of the manager's embezzlements--there would  be an examination of accounts and everything would come out. Milburgh  himself was not unmindful of this argument in his favour, as was to be  revealed.    As against this, Tarling thought, it was notorious that criminals did  foolish things. They took little or no account of the immediate  consequences of their act, and a man like Milburgh, in his desperation,  might in his very frenzy overlook the possibility of his crime coming to  light through the very deed he had committed to cover himself up.    He had reached the bottom of Edgware Road and was turning the corner of  the street, looking across to the Marble Arch, when he heard a voice hail  him and turning, saw a cab breaking violently to the edge of the  pavement.    It was Inspector Whiteside who jumped out.    \"I was just coming to see you,\" he said. \"I thought your interview with  the young lady would be longer. Just wait a moment, till I've paid the  cabman--by-the-way, I saw your Chink servant and gather you sent him to  the Yard on a spoof errand.\"    When he returned, he met Tarling's eye and grinned sympathetically.    \"I know what's in your mind,\" he said frankly, \"but really the Chief  thinks it no more than an extraordinary coincidence. I suppose you made  inquiries about your revolver?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"And can you discover how it came to be in the possession of----\" he  paused, \"the murderer of Thornton Lyne?\"    \"I have a theory, half-formed, it is true, but still a theory,\" said  Tarling. \"In fact, it's hardly so much a theory as an hypothesis.\"    Whiteside grinned again.    \"This hair-splitting in the matter of logical terms never did mean much  in my young life,\" he said, \"but I take it you have a hunch.\"    Without any more to-do, Tarling told the other of the discovery he had  made in Ling Chu's box, the press cuttings, descriptive of the late Mr.  Lyne's conduct in Shanghai and its tragic sequel.    Whiteside listened in silence.    \"There may be something on that side,\" he said at last when Tarling had  finished. \"I've heard about your Ling Chu. He's a pretty good policeman,  isn't he?\"    \"The best in China,\" said Tarling promptly, \"but I'm not going to pretend  that I understand his mind. These are the facts. The revolver, or rather  the pistol, was in my cupboard and the only person who could get at it  was Ling Chu. There is the second and more important fact imputing  motive, that Ling Chu had every reason to hate Thornton Lyne, the man who  had indirectly been responsible for his sister's death. I have been  thinking the matter over and I now recall that Ling Chu was unusually  silent after he had seen Lyne. He has admitted to me that he has been to  Lyne's Store and in fact has been pursuing inquiries there. We happened  to be discussing the possibility of Miss Rider committing the murder and  Ling Chu told me that Miss Rider could not drive a motor-car and when I  questioned him as to how he knew this, he told me that he had made  several inquiries at the Store. This I knew nothing about.    \"Here is another curious fact,\" Tarling went on. \"I have always been  under the impression that Ling Chu did not speak English, except a few  words of 'pigeon' that Chinamen pick up through mixing with foreign  devils. Yet he pushed his inquiries at Lyne's Store amongst the  employees, and it is a million to one against his finding any shop-girl  who spoke Cantonese!\"    \"I'll put a couple of men on to watch him,\" said Whiteside, but Tarling  shook his head.    \"It would be a waste of good men,\" he said, \"because Ling Chu could lead  them just where he wanted to. I tell you he is a better sleuth than any  you have got at Scotland Yard, and he has an absolute gift for fading out  of the picture under your very nose. Leave Ling Chu to me, I know the way  to deal with him,\" he added grimly.    \"The Little Daffodil!\" said Whiteside thoughtfully, repeating the phrase  which Tarling had quoted. \"That was the Chinese girl's name, eh? By Jove!  It's something more than a coincidence, don't you think, Tarling?\"    \"It may be or may not be,\" said Tarling; \"there is no such word as  daffodil in Chinese. In fact, I am not so certain that the daffodil is  a native of China at all, though China's a mighty big place. Strictly  speaking the girl was called 'The Little Narcissus,' but as you say, it  may be something more than a coincidence that the man who insulted  her, is murdered whilst her brother is in London.\"    They had crossed the broad roadway as they were speaking and had passed  into Hyde Park. Tarling thought whimsically that this open space  exercised the same attraction on him as it did upon Mr. Milburgh.    \"What were you going to see me about?\" he asked suddenly, remembering  that Whiteside had been on his way to the hotel when they had met.    \"I wanted to give you the last report about Milburgh.\"    Milburgh again! All conversation, all thought, all clues led to that  mystery man. But what Whiteside had to tell was not especially thrilling.  Milburgh had been shadowed day and night, and the record of his doings  was a very prosaic one.    But it is out of prosaic happenings that big clues are born.    \"I don't know how Milburgh expects the inquiry into Lyne's accounts will  go,\" said Whiteside, \"but he is evidently connected, or expects to be  connected, with some other business.\"    \"What makes you say that?\" asked Tarling.    \"Well,\" replied Whiteside, \"he has been buying ledgers,\" and Tarling  laughed.    \"That doesn't seem to be a very offensive proceeding,\" he said  good-humouredly. \"What sort of ledgers?\"    \"Those heavy things which are used in big offices. You know, the sort of  thing that it takes one man all his time to lift. He bought three at  Roebuck's, in City Road, and took them to his house by taxi. Now my  theory,\" said Whiteside earnestly, \"is that this fellow is no ordinary  criminal, if he is a criminal at all. It may be that he has been keeping  a duplicate set of books.\"    \"That is unlikely,\" interrupted Tarling, \"and I say this with due respect  for your judgment, Whiteside. It would want to be something more than an  ordinary criminal to carry all the details of Lyne's mammoth business in  his head, and it is more than possible that your first theory was right,  namely, that he contemplates either going with another firm, or starting  a new business of his own. The second supposition is more likely. Anyway,  it is no crime to own a ledger, or even three. By-the-way, when did he  buy these books?\"    \"Yesterday,\" said Whiteside, \"early in the morning, before Lyne's opened.  How did your interview with Miss Rider go off?\"    Tarling shrugged his shoulders. He felt a strange reluctance to discuss  the girl with the police officer, and realised just how big a fool he was  in allowing her sweetness to drug him.    \"I am convinced that, whoever she may suspect, she knows nothing of the  murder,\" he said shortly.    \"Then she _does_ suspect somebody?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"Who?\"    Again Tarling hesitated.    \"I think she suspects Milburgh,\" he said.    He put his hand in the inside of his jacket and took out a pocket case,  opened it, and drew forth the two cards bearing the finger impressions he  had taken of Odette Rider. It required more than an ordinary effort of  will to do this, though he would have found it difficult to explain just  what tricks his emotions were playing.    \"Here are the impressions you wanted,\" he said. \"Will you take them?\"    Whiteside took the cards with a nod and examined the inky smudges, and  all the time Tarling's heart stood still, for Inspector Whiteside was the  recognised authority of the Police Intelligence Department on finger  prints and their characteristics.    The survey was a long one.    Tarling remembered the scene for years afterwards; the sunlit path, the  straggling idlers, the carriages pursuing their leisurely way along the  walks, and the stiff military"]]]
