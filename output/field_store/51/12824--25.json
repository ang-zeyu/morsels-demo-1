We fancy we recognise one idea, and it is but another,  which differs slightly from the preceding one. By means of  distinctions we ought to struggle against this flowing away and flight  of ideas.]    [Footnote 32: I think I have come across in ARISTOTLE the ingenious  idea that the enfeeblement of the consciousness and its disorder may  be due to the enfeeblement and disorder of the object. It is a theory  which is by no means improbable.]          CHAPTER IX    DEFINITIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY      Let us resume the study of the preceding ideas in another form. Since,  moreover, to define mind is at the same time to define psychology, let  us seek for the truth which we can glean from the definitions of this  science. Our object is not to discover an exact definition, but to  make use of those already existing.    To define psychology is to describe the features of the domain over  which this science holds sway, and at the same time to indicate the  boundaries which separate it from its neighbours. At first sight this  is an affair of geometric survey, presenting no kind of difficulty;  for psychology does not merge by insensible transitions into the  neighbouring sciences, as physics does with chemistry, for example, or  chemistry with biology.    To all the sciences of external nature psychology offers the violent  opposition of the moral to the physical world. It cannot be put in  line with the physical sciences. It occupies, on the contrary, a  position apart. It is the starting point, the most abstract and simple  of the moral sciences; and it bears the same relation to them that  mechanics does to the physical.    All this is doubtless true; and yet a very great difficulty has been  experienced in condensing into a clear definition the essence of  psychology. This is proved by the multiplicity of definitions  attempted. They are so many because none of them has proved completely  satisfactory. Their abundance shows their insufficiency. I will try to  introduce a little order into these attempts, and propose to  distribute the definitions of psychology into the following  categories:--         1. The definition by substance; the metaphysical definition            _par excellence_.         2. The definition by enumeration.         3.  \"      \"         method.         4.  \"      \"         degree of certainty.         5.  \"      \"         content.         6.  \"      \"         point of view.         7.  \"      \"         the peculiar nature of mental laws.    We will rapidly run through this series of efforts at definition, and  shall criticise and reject nearly the whole of them; for the last  alone seems exact--that is to say, in harmony with the ideas laid down  above.    Metaphysical definition has to-day taken a slightly archaistic turn.  Psychology used to be considered as the _science of the soul_. This  is quite abandoned. Modern authors have adopted the expression and  also the idea of Lange,[33] who was, I think, the first to declare  that we ought to cultivate a _soulless psychology_. This categorical  declaration caused an uproar, and a few ill-informed persons  interpreted it to mean that the new psychology which has spread in  France under cover of the name of Ribot, sought to deny the existence  of the soul, and was calculated to incline towards materialism. This  is an error.    It is very possible, indeed, that several adepts of the new or  experimental psychology may be materialists from inward conviction.  The exclusive cultivation of external facts, of phenomena termed  material, evidently tends--this is a mystery to none--to incline the  mind towards the metaphysical doctrine of materialism. But, after  making this avowal, it is right to add at once that psychology, as a  science of facts, is the vassal of no metaphysical doctrine. It is  neither spiritualist, materialist, nor monist, but a science of facts  solely. Ribot and his pupils have proclaimed this aloud at every  opportunity. Consequently it must be recognised that the rather  amphibological expression \"soulless psychology\" implies no negation of  the existence of the soul. It is--and this is quite a different  thing--rather an attitude of reserve in regard to this problem. We do  not solve this problem; we put it on one side.    And, certainly, we are right to do so. The soul, viewed as a  substance--that is, as a something distinct from psychical phenomena,  which, while being their cause and support, yet remains inaccessible  to our direct means of cognition--is only an hypothesis, and it cannot  serve as objective to a science of facts. This would imply a  contradiction in terms.    Unfortunately; we must confess that if it be right to relegate to  metaphysics the discussion on the concept of the soul, it does not  really suffice to purge our minds of all metaphysics; and a person who  believes himself to be a simple and strict experimentalist is often a  metaphysician without knowing it. These excommunications of  metaphysics also seem rather childish at the present day. There is  less risk than some years ago in declaring that: \"Here metaphysics  commence and positive science ends, and I will go no further.\" There  is even a tendency in modern psychologists to interest themselves in  the highest philosophical problems, and to take up a certain position  with regard to them.    The second kind of definition is, we have said, that by enumeration.  It consists in placing before the eyes of the reader an assortment of  psychological phenomena and then saying: \"These are the things  psychology studies.\" One will take readily as samples the ideas,  reasonings, emotions, and other manifestations of mental life. If this  is only a strictly provisional definition, a simple introduction to  the subject, we accept it literally. It may serve to give us a first  impression of things, and to refresh the memories of those who, by a  rather extraordinary chance, would not doubt that psychology studies  our thoughts. But whatever may be the number of these deeply ignorant  persons, they constitute, I think, a negligible quantity; and, after  these preliminaries, we must come to a real definition and not juggle  with the problem, which consists in indicating in what the spiritual  is distinguished from the material. Let us leave on one side,  therefore, the definitions by enumeration.    Now comes the definition by method. Numbers of authors have supposed  that it is by its method that psychology is distinguished from the  other sciences.    To the mind is attached the idea of the within, to nature the idea of  being without the mind, of constituting a \"without\" (_un dehors_). It  is a vague idea, but becomes precise in a good many metaphors, and has  given rise to several forms of speech. Since the days of Locke, we  have always spoken of the internal life of the mind as contrasted  with the external life, of subjective reality as contrasted with  objective reality; and in the same way we oppose the external senses  to the inner sense (the internal perception), which it has at times  been proposed to erect into a sixth sense. Though no longer quite the  Cartesian dualism, this is still a dualism.    It has also been said that psychology is the science of introspection,  and, in addition, that scientific psychology is a controlled  introspection. This science of the \"internal facts of man\" would thus  be distinguished from the other natural sciences which are formed by  the use of our outer senses, by external observation--that is to say,  to use a neologism, by externospection. This verbal symmetry may  satisfy for a moment minds given to words, but on reflection it is  perceived that the distinction between introspection and  externospection does not correspond to a fundamental and constant  difference in the nature of things or in the processes of cognition. I  acknowledge it with some regret, and thus place myself in  contradiction with myself; for I for a long time believed, and have  even said in print, that psychology is the science of introspection.  My error arose from my having made too many analyses of detail, and  not having mounted to a sufficiently wide-reaching conception.    The definition I have given of consciousness is the implied  condemnation of the above ideas. Consciousness, being nothing but an  act of revelation, has neither a within nor a without; it does not  correspond to a special domain which would be an inner one with regard  to another domain.    Every consideration on the position of things is borrowed from the  sphere of the object, and remains foreign to the sphere of the  consciousness. It is by an abuse of language that we speak of the  outer world in relation to the world of consciousness, and it is pure  imagination on the part of philosophers to have supposed that our  sensations are first perceived as internal states and states of  consciousness, and are subsequently projected without to form the  outer world. The notion of internal and external is only understood  for certain objects which we compare by position to certain others.    In fact, we find that the opposition between an external and an  internal series is generally founded on two characteristics: sensation  is considered external in relation to the idea, and an object of  cognition is considered as internal when it is accessible only to  ourselves. When these two characteristics are isolated from each  other, one may have doubts; but when they co-exist, then the  outwardness or inwardness appears fully evidenced. We see then that  this distinction has nothing to do with the value of consciousness,  and has nothing mental about it.    It is thus that our ideas are judged from internal events. It is our  microcosm opposed to the macrocosm. It is the individual opposed to  the social. Looking at an external object, we remain in communion with  our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21081"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XLIII., No. 25, December 18, 1880 (#19)"],[1,"season, and we wish to know what is best to coat the inside of our steam  boilers to keep them from rusting. Some say black oil, and others common  tallow: which do you recommend as the best? A. We think the black oil  quite as good and cheaper than tallow. Have the surfaces thoroughly  cleaned before applying the oil.    (23) O. H. asks for a cheap and easy way of amalgamating battery zincs.  A. It depends on the kind of battery. In the Fuller the mercury is  placed in the porous cell with the zinc. In bichromate batteries all  that is necessary is to dip the zinc in the bichromate solution and then  pour on a drop or two of mercury. It soon spreads over the entire  surface of the zinc. Another method is to dip the zincs in dilute  sulphuric acid and then pour on a little mercury, but these methods,  except in the case of the Fuller battery, are wasteful of mercury. It is  better to apply an amalgamating solution with a brush. This solution is  made by dissolving one part (by weight) of mercury in five parts of  nitro-muriatic acid (nitric acid one part, muriatic acid three parts),  heating the solution moderately to quicken the action; and, after  complete solution, add five parts more of nitro-muriatic acid.    (24) G. W. asks: 1. Would a perfectly round ball of the same specific  gravity throughout lie still on a level surface? A. Yes. 2. Can a  mechanic's square be made so true that a four-inch block may be made  exactly square by such an instrument? A. Yes.    (25) W. H. asks: 1. What is the weight of a boiler 24 feet long, 44  inches diameter, 1/4 inch thick? A. With two flues, 16 inches diameter,  6,900 lb. 2. What is the contents (in gallons) of a tank 15 feet deep,  10 feet in diameter, top and bottom diameters being equal? Please give  me a formula. A. Area of 10 feet diameter = 78.54 x 15 feet deep = 1,178  cubic feet, and, allowing 71/2 gallons per cubic foot = 1,178 x 7.5 =  8,835 gallons.    (26) C. L. W. writes: I have constructed a small induction coil to be  used for giving shocks. It is 3 inches long. The primary coil is wound  with 3 layers of No. 18 cotton covered wire, and the secondary consists  of about 12 layers of No. 38 silk covered. 1. How many cells and what  kind of battery shall I use to get the best results? A. For temporary  use one cell of Grenet battery would answer, but for continued use some  form of sulphate of copper battery is to be preferred. 2. Is it  necessary that the spring and screw in the interrupter should be coated  with platinum? A. Yes; otherwise they would soon burn out.    (27) H. C. P. writes: In the Scientific American of September 18, Mr. B.  Y. D., query 26, asks whether a sun dial, made for latitude 48 deg. 15', can  be utilized in latitude 38 deg. 50' for showing correct time. To make his  dial available in the lower latitudes, he has only to lift the south  side, so as to give the face a slope to the north, equal to the  difference of the latitude, in this case 9 deg. 25'. For then the plane of  the gnomon being in the plane of the meridian, the edge of the gnomon  casting the shadow will be parallel with the earth's axis; and the face  of the dial will be parallel with the horizon of the latitude for which  the dial was made, and the graduation will show the time required; that  is, on the supposition that it was correctly made, and for a horizontal  dial.    (28) O. M. M. asks for a cheap process of plating steel case knives  with tin. A. Clean the metal thoroughly by boiling in strong potash  water, rinsing, pickling in dilute sulphuric acid, and scouring with a  stiff brush and fine sand. Pass through strong aqueous salammoniac  solution, then plunge in hot oil (palm or tallow). When thoroughly  heated remove and dip in a pot of fused tin (grain tin) covered with  tallow. When tinned, drain in oil pot and rub with a bunch of hemp.  Clean and polish in hot sawdust.    (29) V. R. P. writes: I have an aquarium which contains 4-2/3 gallons of  water. How many fish must I have in it--average length of fish 11/2 to 2  inches to insure the health of the fish? At present, I refill the  aquarium semi-weekly. Please tell me a process by which I can lengthen  the time. A. Put in three fish, 11/2 inches in length, to one gallon of  water, one small bunch of fresh water plants to one gallon of water.  Tadpoles (after they have cast their branchia or gills), newts, and rock  fish can be used to the extent of six to the gallon. The aquatic plants  will supply the fish with sufficient oxygen, so that the water will  seldom require changing.    (30) A. S. writes: I am about to construct an aqueduct 1,200 feet in  length, the water level differing 40 feet. By placing a forcing pump in  the valley I could then raise the water to a height of 40 feet, and  having erected a tank at that height and connected it by means of pipes  with another tank 1,200 feet distant, but on the same level, the water  according to a law of nature would travel over the distance of 1,200  feet. But finding it very difficult to erect tank 40 feet high, I would  prefer to construct the whole on the incline. Will the forcing pump  having just power enough to raise the water 40 feet perpendicularly into  the tank have sufficient power to force it into a tank of the same  elevation through 1,200 feet of pipe running on the incline, or must I  have more power, and how much more? A. The forcing pump must have enough  more power to overcome its own additional friction and the friction of  water in the long inclined pipe. Allow 20 per cent more power at least.           *       *       *       *       *      MINERALS, ETC.--Specimens have been received from the following  correspondents, and examined, with the results stated:    Box marked C.
