'Why, no! And, between ourselves, it is that which induces me       to doubt sometimes the truth of my opinions. My life, upon the       whole, I consider a failure; on which account, I would not       counsel you, or anyone, to follow my example too closely. It       is getting late, and you had better be going, especially as       your father, you say, is anxious about you. But, as we may       never meet again, I think there are three things which I may       safely venture to press upon you. The first is, that the       decencies and gentlenesses should never be lost sight of, as       the practice of the decencies and gentlenesses is at all times       compatible with independence of thought and action. The second       thing which I would wish to impress upon you is, that there is       always some eye upon us; and that it is impossible to keep       anything we do from the world, as it will assuredly be divulged       by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do so. The third       thing which I would wish to press upon you----'         'Yes,' said the youth, eagerly bending forward.         'Is'--and here the elderly individual laid down his pipe upon       the table--'that it will be as well to go on improving yourself       in German!'    Taylor it was who, when Borrow determined to try his fortunes in London  with those bundles of unsaleable manuscripts, gave him introductions to  Sir Richard Phillips and to Thomas Campbell. It was in the agnostic  spirit that he had learned from Taylor that he wrote during this period  to his one friend in London, Roger Kerrison. Kerrison was grandson of  Sir Roger Kerrison, Mayor of Norwich in 1778, as his son Thomas was  after him in 1806. Roger was articled, as was Borrow, to the firm of  Simpson and Rackham, while his brother Allday was in a drapery store in  Norwich, but with mind bent on commercial life in Mexico. George was  teaching him Spanish in these years as a preparation for his great  adventure. Roger had gone to London to continue his professional  experience. He finally became a Norwich solicitor and died in 1882.  Allday went to Zacatecas, Mexico, and acquired riches. John Borrow  followed him there and met with an early death, as we have seen. Borrow  and Roger Kerrison were great friends at this time; but when _Lavengro_  was written they had ceased to be this, and Roger is described merely as  an 'acquaintance' who had found lodgings for him on his first visit to  London. As a matter of fact that trip to London was made easy for Borrow  by the opportunity given to him of sharing lodgings with Roger Kerrison  at Milman Street, Bedford Row, where Borrow put in an appearance on 1st  April 1824, some two months after the following letter was written:      To Mr. Roger Kerrison, 18 Milman Street, Bedford Row.                    NORWICH, _Jany. 20, 1824._         DEAREST ROGER,--I did not imagine when we separated in the       street, on the day of your departure from Norwich, that we       should not have met again: I had intended to have come and seen       you off, but happening to dine at W. Barron's I got into       discourse, and the hour slipt past me unawares.         I have been again for the last fortnight laid up with that       detestable complaint which destroys my strength, impairs my       understanding, and will in all probability send me to the       grave, for I am now much worse than when you saw me last. But       _nil desperandum est_, if ever my health mends, and possibly it       may by the time my clerkship is expired, I intend to live in       London, write plays, poetry, etc., abuse religion and get       myself prosecuted, for I would not for an ocean of gold remain       any longer than I am forced in this dull and gloomy town.         I have no news to regale you with, for there is none abroad,       but I live in the expectation of shortly hearing from you, and       being informed of your plans and projects; fear not to be       prolix, for the slightest particular cannot fail of being       interesting to one who loves you far better than parent or       relation, or even than the God whom bigots would teach him to       adore, and who subscribes himself, Yours unalterably,                    GEORGE BORROW.[47]    Borrow might improve his German--not sufficiently as we shall see in our  next chapter--but he would certainly never make a lawyer. Long years  afterwards, when, as an old man, he was frequently in Norwich, he not  seldom called at that office in Tuck's Court, where five strange years  of his life had been spent. A clerk in Rackham's office in these later  years recalls him waiting for the principal as he in his youth had  watched others waiting.[48]      FOOTNOTES:    [44] _Norvicensian_, 1888, p. 177.

Mr. Martelli writes:    'Old memories brought him to our office for professional advice, and  there I saw something of him, and a very striking personality he was,  and a rather difficult client to do business with. One peculiarity I  remember was that he believed himself to be plagued by autograph  hunters, and was reluctant to trust our firm with his signature in any  shape or form, and that we in consequence had some trouble in inducing  him to sign his will. I have seen him sitting over my fire in my room at  that office for hours, half asleep, and crooning out Romany songs while  waiting for my chief.'          CHAPTER IX    SIR RICHARD PHILLIPS         _'That's a strange man!' said I to myself, after I had left the       house, 'he is evidently very clever; but I cannot say that I       like him much with his Oxford Reviews and Dairyman's       Daughters.'_--LAVENGRO.      Borrow lost his father on the 28th February 1824. He reached London on  the 2nd April of the same year, and this was the beginning of his many  wanderings. He was armed with introductions from William Taylor, and  with some translations in manuscript from Danish and Welsh poetry. The  principal introduction was to Sir Richard Phillips, a person of some  importance in his day, who has so far received but inadequate treatment  in our own.[49] Phillips was active in the cause of reform at a certain  period in his life, and would seem to have had many sterling qualities  before he was spoiled by success. He was born in the neighbourhood of  Leicester, and his father was 'in the farming line,' and wanted him to  work on the farm, but he determined to seek his fortune in London. After  a short absence, during which he clearly proved to himself that he was  not at present qualified to capture London, young Phillips returned to  the farm. Borrow refers to his patron's vegetarianism, and on this point  we have an amusing story from his own pen! He had been, when previously  on the farm, in the habit of attending to a favourite heifer:         During his sojournment in London this animal had been killed;       and on the very day of his return to his father's house, he       partook of part of his favourite at dinner, without his being       made acquainted with the circumstance of its having been       slaughtered during his absence. On learning this, however, he       experienced a sudden indisposition; and declared that so great       an effect had the idea of his having eaten part of his       slaughtered favourite upon him, that he would never again taste       animal food; a vow to which he has hitherto firmly adhered.[50]    Farming not being congenial, Phillips hired a small room in Leicester,  and opened a school for instruction in the three R's, a large blue flag  on a pole being his 'sign' or signal to the inhabitants of Leicester,  who seem to have sent their children in considerable numbers to the  young schoolmaster. But little money was to be made out of schooling,  and a year later Phillips was, by the kindness of friends, started in a  small hosiery shop in Leicester. Throwing himself into politics on the  side of reform, Phillips now started the _Leicester Herald_, to which  Dr. Priestley became a contributor. The first number was issued gratis  in May 1792. His _Memoir_ informs us that it was an article in this  newspaper that secured for its proprietor and editor eighteen months  imprisonment in Leicester gaol, but he was really charged with selling  Paine's _Rights of Man_. The worthy knight had probably grown ashamed of  _The Rights of Man_ in the intervening years, and hence the reticence of  the memoir. Phillips's gaoler was the once famous Daniel Lambert, the  notorious 'fat man' of his day. In gaol Phillips was visited by Lord  Moira and the Duke of Norfolk. It was this Lord Moira who said in the  House of Lords in 1797 that 'he had seen in Ireland the most absurd, as  well as the most disgusting tyranny that any nation ever groaned under.'  Moira became Governor-General of Bengal and Commander-in-Chief of the  Army in India. The Duke of Norfolk, a stanch Whig, distinguished himself  in 1798 by a famous toast at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, Arundel  Street, Strand:--'Our sovereign's health--the majesty of the people!'  which greatly offended George III., who removed Norfolk from his  lord-lieutenancy. Phillips seems to have had a very lax imprisonment, as  he conducted the _Herald_ from gaol, contributing in particular a weekly  letter. Soon after his release he disposed of the _Herald_, or permitted  it to die. It was revived a few years later as an organ of Toryism.

So much heart-breaking labour under the burning sun thrown away for  nothing; the dreary work to commence afresh, almost from the beginning!  Had the thief been any ordinary one, the denunciation would have  been unbounded; but no one lifted his tongue very loudly against Mary  Musgrave. Yet mounted men were despatched on the three trails to bring  back the booty if possible, and the rest moved dejectedly toward their  old club. The greasy Jew did not attempt to conceal his exultation. He  served his customers with his wicked old face glowing with smiles, and  when a moment's breathing-time came he observed:    \"We all 'az hour lettle surbrizes in dis wairld, an' I most confaiss I  am asdonished myself to lairn that Mess Mosgrave is a thief--\" But here  a crashing among the glassware announced that Tommy Dartmoor had begun  shooting with his left hand, and Herr Gustave sputtered out from behind  the fingers he held before his face, \"Ach Gott! I say nozzing more!\"            GREGORIO, By Percy Hemingway          I--AT THE PARADISO    The Cafe Paradiso was full of people, for the inhabitants of Alexandria  had dined, and the opera season was over. The seats at every table were  occupied, and the fumes of smoke from a hundred cigars partly hid the  ladies of the orchestra. As the waiters pushed aside the swing-doors  of the buffet and staggered into the salon with whisky, absinthe, and  coffee, the click of billiard-balls was heard. The windows facing the  sea were wide open, for the heat was intense, and the murmur of the  waves mingled with the plaintive voices of the violins.    Seated by a table at the far end of the hall, Gregorio Livadas hummed  softly an accompaniment to Suppe's \"Poete et Paysan,\" puffing from time  to time a cloudlet of blue smoke from his mouth. When the music ceased  he joined in the applause, leaning back happily in his chair as the  musicians prepared to repeat the last movement. Meanwhile his eyes  wandered idly over the faces of his neighbors.    When the last chord was struck he saw the women hurry down from the  platform and rush toward the tables where their acquaintances sat. He  heard them demand beer and coffee, and they drank eagerly, for fiddling  in that heat was thirsty work. He watched the weary waiters hastening  from table to table, and he heard the voices around him grow more  animated and the laughter more frequent. One man was fastening a spray  of flowers on the ample bosom of the flautiste, while another sipped  the brown lager from the glass of the big drum, and the old wife of the  conductor left her triangle and cymbals to beg some roses from an Arab  flower-girl. Truly the world was enjoying itself, and Gregorio smiled  dreamily, for the sight of so much gaiety pleased him. He wished one of  the women would come and talk to him; he would have liked to chat with  the fair-haired girl who played the first violin so well. He began to  wonder why she preferred that ugly Englishman with his red face and bald  head. He caught snatches of their conversation. Bah! how uninteresting  it was! for they could barely understand each other. What pleasure did  she find in listening to his bad French? and in her native Hungarian  he could not even say, \"I love.\" Why had she not come to him, Gregorio  Livadas, who could talk to her well and would not mumble like an idiot  and look red and uncomfortable! Then he saw she was drinking champagne,  and he sighed. Ah, yes, these English were rich, and women only cared  for money; they were unable to give up their luxuries for the sake of a  man.    But at this thought Gregorio blushed a little. After all, there was  one woman--the only woman he ought to think of--who was not afraid of  hardship for the sake of her husband. He tried to excuse himself by  arguing that the music had excited him; but he felt a little ashamed,  and as a sop to his not yet quite murdered conscience got up and left  the cafe.    When he turned into the Place Mehemet Ali he remembered suddenly that  he had wasted his evening. It was ten o'clock, too late to set about  the business he had intended. He was angry with himself now as well as  ashamed. He wandered up and down the square, looking at the statue of  the great khedive, silhouetted against the moonlight, and cursed at his  misfortunes.    Why should he, Gregorio Livadas, be in need of money? He had worked  hard, but without success. He could have borne his ill luck had he alone  been the sufferer, but he must consider his child--and, of course, his  wife too. He was really fond of his wife in a way. But he smiled proudly  as he thought of his son, for whom he schemed out a great future. He and  Xantippe would train the boy so carefully that he would grow up to be  a great man, and, what was more, a rich man. How they would laugh,  all three, as they sat in the splendid cafes over their wine, at the  hardships the father had endured! Still he must not forget the present,  and he sorely needed money. He would go to Amos again. Amos was a rich  man, very rich, and a filthy Jew. Amos could easily spare him some money  and renew the last loan. He was going to be successful now and would  be able to pay good interest. What better investment could Amos have?  Surely none. He was going to set up a cafe with the money at Tanta, or  Zagazig, or even Benhur,--yes, Benhur was the best,--where there were  few competitors. Then he would make a fortune, as other Greeks had done,  and Amos would be paid in full. He was not extravagant, no; he had the  business instincts of his race. Half these rich merchants of Alexandria  had begun as he would begin; he would succeed as they had succeeded. The  future was really hopeful, if he could only borrow a little capital.    With these thoughts surging through his brain Gregorio paced up and down  the pavements. At last he turned into the Rue des Soeurs and started  slowly toward his home.    This street, the sink of Alexandria, was at its gayest. The cafes where  cheap liquor is sold were crowded. Soldiers and sailors, natives and the  riffraff of half a dozen nations, jostled one another. The twanging of  guitars and the tinkling of pianos was heard from every house. Women,  underclothed and overpainted, leaned from the upper windows and made  frequent sallies into the street to capture their prey. Loud voices sang  lusty English choruses and French chansonnettes, and Neapolitan songs  tried to assert themselves whenever the uproar ceased for a moment.  Every one talked his, or her, own tongue, and gesture filled in the gaps  when words were wanting. All seemed determined to degrade themselves as  much as possible, and nearly every one seemed supremely happy.    Occasionally there was a fight, and knives were used with unerring  skill; but the mounted police who patrolled the streets, though  overtaxed, managed to preserve a certain amount of order.    Gregorio took very little notice of the scenes through which he passed.  He knew every inch and corner of the quarter that had been his home for  years, and was familiar with most of its inhabitants. He sighed a little  as he thought of the money being lost and won in the stuffy ill-lighted  rooms at the back of the houses, shut out from view of the authorities.  Like most of his race, he was fond of the excitement of gambling. But  of what use were regrets and sighs? he had no money, and must needs go  home. It was vain to try and borrow or to ask credit for his losses; in  these gambling hells what is lost must be immediately paid, for tempers  are inflamed by drink and knives are worn at each player's belt.    But he sighed, none the less, at the hard necessity that compelled him  to pass down the street without once entering the doors of a tavern. It  was very hot, and he had smoked many cigarettes. He would have been glad  to call for a drink. The tavern-keepers, though they were his friends,  expected to be paid. One or two women beckoned to him, who would have  willingly offered him wine, but he was proud enough to ignore them.    He became more moody and dejected as he went along, silent and sober  amid so much revelry. When he reached his house he saw a drunken man  lying on the threshold asleep. He stooped to look into his face and  recognised an Englishman, the foreman of some tramp in the harbour. He  kicked the recumbent form testily as he strode over it.    \"These English, what beasts they are!\" he growled, \"and I--I have not a  piastre for a single glass of wine.\"          II--CONCERNING A DEBT    Gregorio found, on entering his house, that his wife was already in bed.  He went into the tiny kitchen and saw a plate of macaroni ready for  his supper. He tried to eat some, but it stuck in his throat. He took a  bottle of cheap Cretan wine from a shelf and drank from it; but the wine  was sour, and he spat it from his mouth with a curse.    Taking up the lamp, he went into the bedroom. His wife was fast  asleep with the boy in her arms. For a moment a smile flickered round  Gregorio's mouth as he looked at them. Then he took off his boots and  his coat, blew out the lamp, and lay beside them. He was very tired  after his long tramp in the hot streets, but he could not sleep. Angrily  he tossed from side to side and closed his eyes tightly; but it was no  good, sleep would not come.    At midnight he heard a call to prayer chanted from the minaret of a tiny  mosque in the neighbourhood. The muezzin's voice irritated him. He  did not wish to pray, and he did want to sleep. He swore that it was  insanity for these fools of Mohammedans to declare that prayer was  better than sleep.    Then the thoughts that had agitated him during the walk returned to him.  The Rue des Soeurs was still noisy with merry-makers, and it"]]]
