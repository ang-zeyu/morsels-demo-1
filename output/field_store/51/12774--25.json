Although the acceptance involved the surrender of heavy  professional emolument, the high honor, the permanence of the tenure, and  the opportunity of gratifying his juridical studies that he so much loved,  joined in compelling his acquiescence.    \"The atrocious crime of being a young man,\" which had compelled a hatred  of William Pitt the younger, in a former day, was now brought up against  him by many whose party subserviency fairly blushed before his manly  integrity, and by others who envied him his success. But one year at the  Circuit silenced all complaint. And in his thirty-third year he was  acknowledged to be the able jurist whom, at his death in his sixty-sixth  year of age, a whole nation mourned.    Dismissing for the present all consideration of his judicial life, and all  estimate of his ability upon the bench, and passing over nearly twenty  years of his life, we meet him in the possession of his fourth great honor  in life--but an honor which was ever the first prized by him in all his  after career--the appointment of Law Professor in Cambrige Law School.    Mr. Nathan Dane, whose Abridgement of American law in many volumes had  obtained for him the gratitude of the profession at large, and the more  substantial testimonial of pecuniary profit, had determined, about the  fiftieth year of Judge Story's life, to repay the law some of the profits  which its votaries had bestowed upon him, by donating ten thousand dollars  for the establishment of a new professorship.  He annexed to his donation,  however, the condition that Judge Story should be the incumbent. To the  great delight of the donor, and of the College Fellows, the Judge  assented, and was inaugurated as Dane Professor of Law, with a special  view to Lectures upon the Law of Nations, Commercial and Maritime Law,  Federal Law and Equity--a station which he filled to the day of his  lamented death.    This brief survey of his life presents him then in several public aspects;  as a student, as an advocate, as a statesman, as a judge, and as an  expounder of the great principles of law, which he worshipped with an  idolatry of love.    To speak of his political career would not belong to the scope of our  article. And to sit in judgment upon his judicial career would be our  presumption. Older and abler pens must render their tributes to the extent  and varied richness of his legal lore, which, taking root in principles,  branched into the minutiae of detail, under every sun and in every clime  where law is recognized as a rule of human action. His judicial fame can  never be increased or diminished by individual estimate. The law of  patents, of admiralty and prizes, the jurisprudence of equity, and above  all, his luminous explorations of what were once constitutional  labyrinths, are monuments as indestructible as the Pyramids. If every  trace of their original oneness be lost, they will yet live in the hours  of future judicial days, in professional acts, and in the guiding policy  of a remote posterity. His library of treatises are legal classics; and  the worst defects which flippant carpers and canvassers of their claims to  merit have discovered in their pages, have been their richness of detail  and polish of learning! And no one can deny that as a judge he was the  very example which 'Hobbes' in his 'Leviathan,' carried in mind when he  thus wrote--\"the things that make a good judge or good interpreter of the  laws, are first--a right understanding of that principal law of nature  called Equity, which depending not on the reading of other men's writings,  but on the goodness of a man's own natural reason and meditation, is  presumed to be in those most who have had most leisure and the most  inclination to meditate thereon; second--contempt of unnecessary riches and  preferments; third--to be able in judgment to divest himself of all fear,  anger, hatred, love and compassion; fourthly and lastly--patience to hear,  diligent attention in hearing, and memory to retain, digest, and apply  what he hath heard.\"    Not the least amiable phase of the life of Judge Story, was the attention  which he gave to letters and literary pursuits. He was no _mere_ lawyer:  no stringer of professional centos. He never hid his heart with the veil  of dignity; nor smothered his fresh impulses (preserved intact from  worldly rust since boyhood) with the weight of his judicial and  professional labors. While he believed that the law was a jealous  mistress, he knew that this mistress was too stable and sensible to decree  that a gentle dalliance or seasonable flirtation with her maids of  honor--Poetry, or the Arts, or Literature, or Love--was an unloyal act. He  could turn from Grotius to Dickens, from Vattel to Thackeray. He could  digest the points of the elaborate arguments of eminent counsel, and then  turn aside to a gentle tonic from the administrating hand of Smollett or  Walter Scott. Method was his master-key to all the combinations in the  locks of labor.    Twice married he never ceased to eulogize the bliss of domesticity.  Surrounded by loving eyes, the currents of his freshened affection flowed  deeper and clearer every year. How he treasured home and home joys may be  collected in the following lines from his poem on solitude (before  referred to), written in his twenty-second year.      \"Grandeur may dazzle with its transient glare    The herd of folly, and the tribe of care,    Who sport and flutter through their listless days,    Like motes that bask in Summer's noontide blaze,    With anxious steps round vacant splendor while,    Live on a look, and banquet on a smile;    But the firm race whose high endowments claim    The laurel-wreath that decks the brow of fame;    Who warmed by sympathy's electric glow,    In rapture tremble, and dissolve in woe,    Blest in _retirement_, scorn the frowns of fate,    And feel a transport power can ne'er create.\"    Touching the poem from which these lines are taken, we remember being  shown the only copy of the published book which was known to exist, by the  family of the Judge. The Assistant Librarian (who was born for his station  in all that regards enthusiastic love of his duties), of the Harvard  College library, showed us, with great triumph, a small sheep-bound  volume, entitled \"Solitude and other Poems, by Joseph Story,\" printed  sometime in the commencement of this century: saying, \"the Judge has  burned all the copies he can pick up, and this is only to be read here.\"  This poem was a sore subject to the author. He viewed it as not only a  blot upon his dignity, but an annoyance to his professional fame. Numerous  critics have laughed at it; but apart from the shorter poems, the main  theme showed much aptitude of poetic imagery, invention, and harmony of  expression. Glance at the following lines, which contain much of the  genuine spark:      \"Till nature's self the Vandal torch should raise,    And the vast alcove of creation blaze.\"    Or this--      \"Blaze the vast domes inwrought with fretted gold,    The sumptuous pavements veins or pearl unfold,    Arch piled on arch with columned pride ascend,    Grove linked to grove their mingling shadows blend.\"    Or this--      \"Let narrow prudence boast its grovelling art    To chill the generous sympathies of heart,    Teach to subdue each thought sublimely wild,    And crush, like Herod, fancy's new-born child.\"    It is highly probable that the learned Justice, knowing his taste for the  poetical and fanciful, and his aptitude at the harmony of language, often  erred in his judicial writings and treatises, by avoiding beauty of  expression, in fear lest the dignity of his subject should be injured by  too much association with the creatures of fancy. We have known most  accomplished lawyers err through this same caution. Our biographer himself  (Mr. William W. Story) has certainly done himself great injustice as a  writer in his work on \"Contracts,\" when, in the pages before us, he  presents us with so much delicacy of fancy and rhetorical finish.  Blackstone in his \"Commentaries,\" Jones in his \"Bailment\" treatise,  Stephens in his essay upon \"Pleading,\" time-honored Fearne in his  \"Contingent Remainders,\" have shown how grateful and how suitable it is  for the legal readers to find brilliancy of rhetoric adorning the most  profound learning.    But certainly Judge Story possessed to a remarkable degree the faculty of  condensation in his poetical works. His rhyme was not reason run mad; but  reason in modest holiday attire. Where are lines at once so compact and so  searching in their wisdom as the following, penned in 1832, as matters of  advice to a young law student:      \"Whene'er you speak, remember every cause    Stands not on eloquence, but stands on laws--    Pregnant in matter, in expression brief,    Let every sentence stand in bold relief;    On trifling points nor time nor talents waste,    A sad offence to learning and to taste;    Nor deal with pompous phrase; nor e'er suppose    Poetic flights belong to reasoning prose,    Loose declamation may deceive the crowd,    And seem more striking as it grows more loud;    But sober sense rejects it with disdain,    As nought but empty noise, and weak as vain.    The froth of words, the school-boy's vain parade    Of books and cases--all his stock in trade--    The pert conceits, the cunning tricks and play    Of low attorneys, strung in long array,    The unseemly jest, the petulent reply,    That chatters on, and cares not how, or why,    Studious, avoid--unworthy themes to scan,    They sink the speaker and disgrace the man.

This last explanation  approaches to an admission of natural death, though it is still mythical  in form. The Baganda usually attributed any illness of the king to  ghosts, because no man would dare to practise magic on him. A  much-dreaded ghost was that of a man's sister; she was thought to vent  her spite on his sons and daughters by visiting them with sickness. When  she proved implacable, a medicine-man was employed to catch her ghost in  a gourd or a pot and throw it away on waste land or drown it in a river.  See Rev. J. Roscoe, _The Baganda_ (London, 1911), pp. 98, 100, 101  _sq._, 286 _sq._, 315 _sq._]          LECTURE III    MYTHS OF THE ORIGIN OF DEATH      [Sidenote: Belief of savages in man's natural immortality.]    In my last lecture I shewed that many savages do not believe in what we  call a natural death; they imagine that all men are naturally immortal  and would never die, if their lives were not cut prematurely short by  sorcery. Further, I pointed out that this mistaken view of the nature of  death has exercised a disastrous influence on the tribes who entertain  it, since, attributing all natural deaths to sorcery, they consider  themselves bound to discover and kill the wicked sorcerers whom they  regard as responsible for the death of their friends. Thus in primitive  society as a rule every natural death entails at least one and often  several deaths by violence; since the supposed culprit being unknown  suspicion may fall upon many persons, all of whom may be killed either  out of hand or as a consequence of failing to demonstrate their  innocence by means of an ordeal.    [Sidenote: Savage stories of the origin of death.]    Yet even the savages who firmly believe in man's natural immortality are  obliged sorrowfully to admit that, as things are at the present day, men  do frequently die, whatever explanation we may give of so unexpected and  unnatural an occurrence. Accordingly they are hard put to it to  reconcile their theory of immortality with the practice of mortality.  They have meditated on the subject and have given us the fruit of their  meditation in a series of myths which profess to explain the origin of  death. For the most part these myths are very crude and childish; yet  they have a value of their own as examples of man's early attempts to  fathom one of the great mysteries which encompass his frail and  transient existence on earth; and accordingly I have here collected, in  all their naked simplicity, a few of these savage guesses at truth.    [Sidenote: Four types of such stories.]    Myths of the origin of death conform to several types, among which we  may distinguish, first, what I will call the type of the Two Messengers;  second, the type of the Waxing and Waning Moon; third, the type of the  Serpent and his Cast Skin; and fourth, the type of the Banana-tree. I  will illustrate each type by examples, and will afterwards cite some  miscellaneous instances which do not fall under any of these heads.    [Sidenote: I. The tale of the Two Messengers. Zulu story of the  chameleon and the lizard. The same story among other Bantu tribes.]    First, then, we begin with the type of the Two Messengers. Stories of  this pattern are widespread in Africa, especially among tribes belonging  to the great Bantu family, which occupies roughly the southern half of  the continent. The best-known example of the tale is the one told by the  Zulus. They say that in the beginning Unkulunkulu, that is, the Old Old  One, sent the chameleon to men with a message saying, \"Go, chameleon, go  and say, Let not men die.\" The chameleon set out, but it crawled very  slowly, and it loitered by the way to eat the purple berries of the  _ubukwebezane_ tree, or according to others it climbed up a tree to bask  in the sun, filled its belly with flies, and fell fast asleep. Meantime  the Old Old One had thought better of it and sent a lizard posting after  the chameleon with a very different message to men, for he said to the  animal, \"Lizard, when you have arrived, say, Let men die.\" So the lizard  went on his way, passed the dawdling chameleon, and arriving first among  men delivered his message of death, saying, \"Let men die.\" Then he  turned on his heel and went back to the Old Old One who had sent him.  But after he was gone, the chameleon at last arrived among men with his  glad tidings of immortality, and he shouted, saying, \"It is said, Let  not men die!\" But men answered, \"O! we have heard the word of the  lizard; it has told us the word, 'It is said, Let men die.' We cannot  hear your word. Through the word of the lizard, men will die.\" And died  they have ever since from that day to this. That is why some of the  Zulus hate the lizard, saying, \"Why did he run first and say, 'Let  people die?'\" So they beat and kill the lizard and say, \"Why did it  speak?\" But others hate the chameleon and hustle it, saying, \"That is  the little thing which delayed to tell the people that they should not  die. If he had only brought his message in time we should not have died;  our ancestors also would have been still living; there would have been  no diseases here on the earth. It all comes from the delay of the  chameleon.\"[57] The same story is told in nearly the same form by other  Bantu tribes, such as the Bechuanas,[58] the Basutos,[59] the  Baronga,[60] and the Ngoni.[61] To this day the Baronga and the Ngoni  owe the chameleon a grudge for having brought death into the world, so  when children find a chameleon they will induce it to open its mouth,  then throw a pinch of tobacco on its tongue, and watch with delight the  creature writhing and changing colour from orange to green, from green  to black in the agony of death; for thus they avenge the wrong which the  chameleon has done to mankind.[62]    [Sidenote: Akamba story of the chameleon and the thrush.]    A story of the same type, but with some variations, is told by the  Akamba, a Bantu tribe of British East Africa; but in their version the  lizard has disappeared from the legend and has been replaced by the  _itoroko_, a small bird of the thrush tribe, with a black head, a  bluish-black back, and a buff-coloured breast. The tale runs thus:--Once  upon a time God sent out the chameleon, the frog, and the thrush to find  people who died one day and came to life again the next. So off they  set, the chameleon leading the way, for in those days he was a very  important personage. Presently they came to some people lying like dead,  so the chameleon went up to them and said, _Niwe, niwe, niwe_. The  thrush asked him testily what he was making that noise for, to which the  chameleon replied mildly, \"I am only calling the people who go forward  and then came back again,\" and he explained that the dead people would  come to life again. But the thrush, who was of a sceptical turn of mind,  derided the idea. Nevertheless, the chameleon persisted in calling to  the dead people, and sure enough they opened their eyes and listened to  him. But here the thrush broke in and told them roughly that dead they  were and dead they must remain. With that away he flew, and though the  chameleon preached to the corpses, telling them that he had come from  God on purpose to bring them to life again, and that they were not to  believe the lies of that shallow sceptic the thrush, they obstinately  refused to pay any heed to him; not one of those dead corpses would  budge. So the chameleon returned crestfallen to God and reported to him  how, when he preached the gospel of resurrection to the corpses, the  thrush had roared him down, so that the corpses could not hear a word he  said. God thereupon cross-questioned the thrush, who stated that the  chameleon had so bungled his message that he, the thrush, felt it his  imperative duty to interrupt him. The simple deity believed the thrush,  and being very angry with the chameleon he degraded him from his high  position and made him walk very slow, lurching this way and that, as he  does down to this very day. But the thrush he promoted to the office of  wakening men from their slumber every morning, which he still does  punctually at 2 A.M. before the note of any other bird is heard in the  tropical forest.[63]    [Sidenote: Togo story of the dog and the frog.]    In this version, though the frog is sent out by God with the other two  messengers he plays no part in the story; he is a mere dummy. But in  another version of the story, which is told by the negroes of Togoland  in German West Africa, the frog takes the place of the lizard and the  thrush as the messenger of death. They say that once upon a time men  sent a dog to God to say that when they died they would like to come to  life again. So off the dog trotted to deliver the message. But on the  way he felt hungry and turned into a house, where a man was boiling  magic herbs. So the dog sat down and thought to himself, \"He is cooking  food.\" Meantime the frog had set off to tell God that when men died they  would like not to come to life again. Nobody had asked him to give that  message; it was a piece of pure officiousness and impertinence on his  part. However, away he tore. The dog, who still sat watching the  hell-broth brewing, saw him hurrying past the door, but he thought to  himself, \"When I have had something to eat, I will soon catch froggy  up.\" However, froggy came in first"]]]
