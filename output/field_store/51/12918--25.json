Dred Scott was a slave of an army officer, who had taken  him from Missouri first into Illinois, a free State, then into  Wisconsin, covered by the Missouri Compromise, then back into Missouri.  Here the slave learned that by decisions of the Missouri courts his life  outside of Missouri constituted him free, and in 1848, having been  whipped by his master, he prosecuted him for assault. The decision was  in his favor, but was reversed when appeal was taken to the Missouri  Supreme Court. Dred Scott was now sold to one Sandford, of New York. Him  also he prosecuted for assault, but as he and Sandford belonged to  different States this suit went to the United States Circuit Court.  Sandford pleaded that this lacked jurisdiction, as the plaintiff was not  a citizen of Missouri but a slave.    It was this last issue which made the case immortal. The Circuit Court  having decided in the defendant's favor, the plaintiff took an appeal to  the Supreme Court. Here the verdict was against the citizenship of the  negro, and therefore against the jurisdiction of the court below. The  upper court did not stop with this simple dictum, hard and dubious as it  was, but proceeded to lay down as law an astounding course of  pro-slavery reasoning. In this it confined the ordinance of 1787 to the  old northwestern territory, declared the Missouri Compromise and all  other legislation against slavery in Territories unconstitutional, and  the slave character portable not only into all the Territories but into  all the States as well, slavery having everywhere all presupposition in  its favor and freedom being on the defensive. The denial of Scott's  citizenship was based solely upon his African descent, the inevitable  implication being that no man of African blood could be an American  citizen.    This decision rendered jubilant all friends of slavery, as also the  ultra Abolitionists, but correspondingly disheartened the sober friends  of human liberty. How, it was asked, is the cause of freedom to be  advanced when the supreme law of the land, as interpreted by the highest  tribunal existing for that purpose, virtually establishes slavery in New  England itself, provided any slave-master wishes to come there with his  troop? But anti-slavery men did not despair. Patriots had of course to  obey the court till its opinion should be reversed, yet its opinion was  at once repudiated as bad law. Men like Sumner, Wilson, Chase, Giddings,  Seward, and Lincoln, appealing to both the history and the letter of the  Constitution, and to the course of legislation and of judicial decisions  on slavery even in the slave States, had been elaborating and  demonstrating the counter theory, under which our fundamental law  appeared as anything but a \"covenant with hell.\"    The pith of this counter theory was that slaves were property not by  moral, natural, or common law, but only by state law, that hence  freedom, not slavery, was the heart and universal presupposition of our  government, and that slavery, not freedom, was bound to show reasons for  its existence anywhere. This being so, while Calhoun and Taney were  right as against Douglas in ascribing to Congress all power over the  Territories, it was as impossible to find slaves in any United States  Territory as to find a king there. Slaves taken into Territories  therefore became free. Slaves taken into any free State became free.  Slaves carried from a slave State on to the high seas became free. Even  the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution must be applied in the way  least favorable to slavery.    On the other hand Douglas was right in his view that citizens and not  States were the partners in the Territories. As to the assertion of  incompatibility between citizenship and African blood, it would not  stand historical examination a moment. If it was true that the framers  of the Constitution did not consciously include colored persons in the  \"ourselves and our posterity\" for whom they purposed the \"Blessings of  Liberty,\" neither did they consciously exclude, as is clear from the  fact that nearly everyone of them expected blacks some time to be free.        CHAPTER VI.    SLAVERY AND THE OLD PARTIES    [1841]    The Democratic Party was predominantly southern, the Whig northern. Both  sought to be of national breadth, but the democratic with much the  better success. Democracy would not give up its northern vote nor the  Whigs their southern; but a better party fealty, due to a longer and  prouder party history, rendered the Democrats far the more independent  and bold in the treatment of their out-lying wing. The consequence was  that while its rank and file at the North never loved slavery, they  tolerated it and became its apologists in a way to make the party as a  whole not only in appearance but in effect the pliant organ of the  slavocracy. This status became more pronounced with the progress of the  controversy and of the South's self-assertion. It was real under  Jackson, rigid under Van Buren, manifest and almost avowed under Polk,  Pierce, and Buchanan.    Whig temper toward slavery was throughout the North much better, but  whig party action was little better. Fear of losing southern supporters  permanently forbade all frank enlistment by the Whig Party for freedom.  The mighty leaders, Adams, Webster, even Clay, were well inclined, and  the party, as such, was at the South persistently accused of alliance  with the Abolitionists. This was untrue. Abolitionists, Liberal Party  men, and Free-soilers oftener voted with Democrats than with Whigs. Clay  complained once that Abolitionists denounced him as a slave-holder,  slave-holders as an Abolitionist, while both voted for Van Buren.  Compromise was the bane of this party as of the other; and each of the  resplendent chieftains named at one time or another seemed so reverent  to Belial that the record is painful reading.    When in 1841 the ship Creole sailed from Richmond with one hundred and  thirty-five slaves on board bound for the southern market, and one  Madison Washington, a recovered runaway on board, headed a dash upon  captain and crew, got possession of the vessel and took her into New  Providence, Clay was as loud as Calhoun or any southern senator in  demanding of the English Government the return of these slaves to  bondage or, at least, that of \"the mutineers,\" as they were called.  Webster, Secretary of State at the time, instructed Edward Everett, our  English minister, to insist upon this, his arguments being sound and his  tone emphatic enough to please Mr. Calhoun. This was the time when  Giddings, of Ohio, brought into the House his resolutions to the effect  that slavery was a state institution only, and that hence any slave  carried on to the open ocean or to any other locality where only  national law prevailed, was free. He was censured in the House by a  large majority and resigned, but his Ohio constituency immediately  re-elected him.    [1836-1844]    Up to this time Giddings and Adams were the only pronounced anti-slavery  men in that body. Adams had acquiesced in the Missouri Compromise, but  all his subsequent career, especially his course in the House of  Representatives after 1830, is not only creditable to him so far as the  slavery question is concerned, but registers him as one of the most  influential opponents of slavery in our history. Refusing to be classed  with the Abolitionists, he was, in effect, the most efficient  Abolitionist of them all.    Previous to 1835, though petitions against slavery reached Congress in  great numbers and nettled many members, they had been received and  referred in the usual manner. But in February, 1836, the House created a  special committee to consider these petitions. It reported a resolution,  which passed under the previous question, that thereafter all papers of  the kind should be tabled without printing or reference. Adams declared  to the House: \"I hold the resolution to be a direct violation of the  Constitution of the United States, the rules of this House, and the  rights of my constituents.\" In this rencounter Adams advanced the view  on which the Emancipation Proclamation by and by proceeded, that  slavery, even in States, was not beyond reach of the national arm, but  would be at the mercy of Congress the instant slave-masters should  rebel. This, the first of the gag laws, was, however, enacted. The  second, or Patton gag, was passed on December 21, 1837, and the third,  or Atherton gag, a year later. The principle of these, practically  cutting off all petitions to Congress respecting slavery, was taken up  in the twenty-first rule of the House in 1840.    Mr. Adams was from the first the resolute and uncompromising foe of the  gag policy. Wagon-loads of petitions came to him to offer, among them  one for his own expulsion from the House and one to dissolve the Union,  and he presented all.    February 6, 1837, he inquired of Mr. Speaker whether or not it would be  appropriate to offer a petition in his hand from slaves, whereupon the  pro-slavery members flew at him like vampires. After much uproar, in  which Adams gave as good as was sent him, he sarcastically reminded his  already infuriated assailants that the petition was in favor of slavery,  not against, and that he had emphatically not offered it, but only made  an innocent inquiry of the Speaker about doing so, the proper answer to  which was so far from obvious that the Speaker himself had signified his  intention to take the sense of the House upon it. Regularly, year after  year, Adams moved the abolition of the gag rule, was beaten as  regularly, long as a matter of course, sometimes after heated debate in  which he was always victor. But little by little the majority vote  against him lessened. In 1842 the gag passed by but four votes, in 1843  it had a majority of three only, in 1844 his motion to strike it out was  carried by a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#19)"],[1,"law to people who know  nothing of law. He assures the world that he can explain all organic  phenomena, and the world believes him.    As a matter of fact, zoology is quite as backward as meteorology.  Those who do not wish to be deceived will do well to receive with  caution all the zoological theories which at present hold the field.  Before many years have passed all of them will have been modified  beyond recognition. Most of them are already out of date.    There are doubtless good reasons for the colouring of both the  grosbeak and the oriole; what these reasons are we know not. But as  neither derives any benefit from the resemblance to the other, this  _resemblance_ cannot have been effected by natural selection. Now,  if the unknown forces, which cause the various organisms to take their  varied colours and forms, sometimes produce two organisms of  different families which closely resemble one another, and the  organisms in question are so distributed that neither can derive the  slightest advantage in the struggle for existence from the  resemblance, there is no reason why similar resemblances should not  be produced in the case of organisms which occupy the same areas of  the earth. Thus it is quite possible that many so-called cases of  mimicry are nothing of the kind.    The mere fact that one of the organisms in question may profit by  the likeness is not sufficient to demonstrate that natural selection  is responsible for the resemblance.    In this connection we must bear in mind that, according to the orthodox  Darwinian theory, the resemblance must have come about gradually,  and in its beginnings it cannot have profited the mimic _as a  resemblance_.    So plastic are organisms, and so great is the number of living things  in the earth, that it is not surprising that very similar forms should  sometimes arise independently and in different parts of the globe.  Several instances of this fortuitous resemblance are cited in  Beddard's _Animal Colouration_; others are cited in _The Making of  Species_ by Finn, and myself.    Perhaps the most striking case is that of a cuckoo found in New Zealand,  known as _Eudynamis taitensis_. This is a near relative of the Indian  koel, which bears remarkable resemblance to an American hawk  (_Accipiter cooperi_). Writing of this cuckoo, Sir Walter Buller  says: \"Not only has our cuckoo the general contour of Cooper's  sparrow-hawk, but the tear-shaped markings on the underparts, and  the arrow-head bars on the femoral plumes are exactly similar in both.  The resemblance is carried still further, in the beautifully-banded  tail and marginal wing coverts, and likewise in the distribution of  colours and markings on the sides of the neck. On turning to Mr.  Sharpe's description of the young male of this species in his  catalogue of the Accipitres in the British Museum, it will be seen  how many of the terms employed apply equally to our Eudynamis, even  to the general words, 'deep brown above with a chocolate gloss, all  the feathers of the upper surface broadly edged with rufous.' ...  Beyond the general grouping of the colours there is nothing to remind  us of our own Bush-hawk; and that there is no great protective  resemblance is sufficiently manifested, from the fact that our cuckoo  is persecuted on every possible occasion by the tits, which are  timorous enough in the presence of a hawk.\"    These cases of chance resemblance should make us unwilling to talk  about \"mimicry,\" unless there is actual proof that one or other of  the similar species benefits by the resemblance.    These cases, further, throw light on the origin of protective mimicry  where it does exist.    Protective mimicry is usually said to have been brought about by the  action of natural selection. This is not strictly accurate. Natural  selection cannot cause two showy, dissimilar species to resemble one  another; all it can do is to seize upon and perfect a resemblance  that has been caused by the numerous factors that have co-operated  to bring about all the diversity of organic life upon this earth.          _THE GREAT HIMALAYAN BARBET_      Barbets may be described as woodpeckers that are trying to become  toucans. The most toucan-like of them all is the great Himalayan  barbet (_Megalaema marshallorum_). Barbets are heavily-built birds  of medium size, armed with formidable beaks, which they do not  hesitate to use for aggressive purposes. As regards the nests they  excavate, the eggs they lay, the pad that grows on the hocks of young  birds, and their flight, they resemble their cousins the woodpeckers.  But they are fruit-eating birds, and not insectivorous; it is this  that constitutes the chief difference between them and the  woodpeckers. Barbets are found throughout the tropical world. A  number of species occur in India. The best known of these is the  coppersmith, or crimson-breasted barbet (_Xantholaema haematocephala_),  the little green fiend, gaudily painted about the head, which makes the  hot weather in India seem worse than it really is by filling the welkin  with the eternal monotone that resembles the sound of a hammer on a  brazen vessel. Nearly as widely distributed are the various species of  green barbet (_Thereiceryx_), whose call is scarcely less exasperating  than that of the coppersmith, and may be described as the word _kutur_  shouted many times and usually preceded by a harsh laugh or cackle.    The finest of all the barbets are the _Megalaemas_. The great  Himalayan barbet attains a length of 13 inches. There is no lack of  colour in its plumage. The head and neck are a rich violet blue. The  upper back is brownish olive with pale green longitudinal streaks.  The lower back and the tail are bright green. The wings are green  washed with blue, brown, and yellow. The upper breast is brown, and  the remainder of the lower plumage, with the exception of a scarlet  patch of feathers under the tail, is yellow with a blue band running  along the middle line. This bright red patch under the tail is not  uncommon in the bird world, and, curiously enough, it occurs in birds  in no way related to one another and having little or nothing in common  as regards habits. It is seen in many bulbuls, robins, and woodpeckers,  and in the pitta. The existence of these red under tail-coverts in  such diverse species can, I think, be explained only on the hypothesis  that there is an inherent tendency to variation in this direction  in many species.    A striking feature of the great Himalayan barbet is its massive yellow  bill, which is as large as that of some species of toucan. Although  the bird displays a number of brilliant colours, it is not at all  easy to distinguish from its leafy surroundings. It is one of those  birds which are heard more often than seen.    Barbets are never so happy as when listening to their own voices.  Most birds sing and make a joyful noise only at the nesting season.  Not so the barbets; they call all the year round; even unfledged  nestlings raise up the voices of infantile squeakiness.    The call of the great Himalayan barbet is very distinctive and easy  to recognise, but is far from easy to portray in words. Jerdon  described the call as a plaintive _pi-o_, _pi-o_. Hutton speaks of  it as _hoo-hoo-hoo_. Scully syllabises it as _till-low_, _till-low_,  _till-low_. Perhaps the best description of the note is that it is  a mournful wailing, _pee-yu_, _pee-yu_, _pee-yu_. Some like the note,  and consider it both striking and pleasant. Others would leave out  the second adjective. Not a few regard the cry as the reverse of  pleasant, and consider the bird a nuisance. As the bird is always  on the move--its call at one moment ascends from the depths of a leafy  valley and at the next emanates from a tree on the summit of some  hill--the note does not get on one's nerves as that of the coppersmith  does. Whether men like its note or not, they all agree that it is  plaintive and wailing. This, too, is the opinion of hillmen, some  of whom declare that the souls of men who have suffered injuries in  the Law Courts, and who have in consequence died of broken hearts,  transmigrate into the great Himalayan barbets, and that is why these  birds wail unceasingly _un-nee-ow_, _un-nee-ow_, which means  \"injustice, injustice.\" Obviously, the hillmen have not a high  opinion of our Law Courts!    Himalayan barbets go about in small flocks, the members of which call  out in chorus. They keep to the top of high trees, where, as has been  said, they are not easily distinguished from the foliage. When perched  they have a curious habit of wagging the tail from side to side, as  a dog does, but with a jerky, mechanical movement. Their flight is  noisy and undulating, like that of a woodpecker. They are said to  subsist exclusively on fruit. This is an assertion which I feel  inclined to challenge. In the first place, the species remains in  the Himalayas all the year round, and fruit must be very scarce there  in winter. Moreover, Mr. S. M. Townsend records that a barbet kept  by him in captivity on one occasion devoured with gusto a dead mouse  that had been placed in its cage. Barbets nest in cavities in the  trunks of trees, which they themselves excavate with their powerful  beaks, after the manner of woodpeckers. The entrance to the nest  cavity is a neat circular hole in a tree at heights varying from 15  to 50 feet. Most birds which rear their broods in holes enter and  leave the nest cavity fearlessly, even when they know they are being  watched by human beings, evidently feeling that their eggs or young  birds are securely hidden away in the heart of the tree. Not so the  _Megalaema_. It is as nervous about the site of its nest as a lapwing  is. Nevertheless, on one occasion, when the nest of a pair of the  great Himalayan barbets was opened out and found to contain an egg  and a young bird, which latter was left unmolested, the parent"]]]
