Douglas Jerrold's little library, sold in August,  1859, in 307 lots, only fetched L173 3s. In very strong contrast to  these is the remarkable little library, formed between 1820 and 1830 by  Henry Perkins, of Hanworth Park, Feltham, a member of the brewing firm.  This collection comprised only 865 lots, but when sold at Sotheby's in  June, 1873, the total was found to be close on L26,000! There was a  copy each of the 42-line and 40-line Gutenberg Bible--the former is now  in the Huth Library, and the latter in the Ashburnham Library; several  other very early printed Bibles, including Coverdale's, Matthews', and  Cranmer's, two works printed by Caxton, with many other important books  were sold.    [Illustration: _J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps._]    The late George Daniel (who was born about 1790) may be regarded as the  connecting link between the collectors of the early part of the present  century and those of to-day. When, for example, Perry and Bindley left  off, Daniel commenced. There was no great rush after Shakespeare quartos  in the earlier part of the present century, and book-collecting for a  time ceased to be the pet hobby of wealthy members of the peerage. When  George Daniel, a critic and bibliographer of exceptional abilities,  began to collect, he soon made Shakespeare, as well as the earlier  English poets, objects of solicitude. He resided for many years in the  historic old red-brick tower at Canonbury.[72:A] The sale of Daniel's  extraordinary collection was held at Sotheby's in July, 1864, when a  First Folio, one of the finest in the world--now in the possession of  Baroness Burdett-Coutts--sold for L716 2s., and when twenty of the  Shakespeare quartos realized a total of about L3,000.    [Illustration: _Canonbury Tower, George Daniel's Residence._]    George Daniel is now remembered by but few book-collectors. Mr. W. Carew  Hazlitt knew him very well, and describes him as a retired accountant,  whose idiosyncrasy consisted of _rares morceaux_, _bonnes bouches_,  uniques--copies of books with a _provenance_, or in jackets made for  them by Roger Payne--nay, in the original parchment or paper wrapper, or  in a bit of real mutton which certain men call sheep. He was a person  of literary tastes, and had written books in his day. But his chief  celebrity was as an acquirer of those of others, provided always that  they were old enough or rare enough. An item never passed into his  possession without at once _ipso facto_ gaining new attributes, almost  invariably worded in a holograph memorandum on the fly-leaf. Daniel was  in the market at a fortunate and peculiar juncture, just when prices  were depressed, about the time of the great Heber sale. His marvellous  gleanings came to the hammer precisely when the quarto Shakespeare, the  black-letter romance, the unique book of Elizabethan verse, had grown  worth ten times their weight in sovereigns. Sir William Tite, J. O.  Halliwell, and Henry Huth were to the front. It was in 1864. What a  wonderful sight it was! No living man had ever witnessed the like.  Copies of Shakespeare, printed from the prompters' MSS. and published at  fourpence, fetched L300 or L400. I remember old Joseph Lilly, when he  had secured the famous Ballads, which came from the Tollemaches of  Helmingham Hall, holding up the folio volume in which they were  contained in triumph as someone whom he knew entered the room. Poor  Daniel! he had no mean estimate of his treasures--what he had was always  better than what you had. Books, prints, autographs--it was all the  same. I met him one morning in Long Acre. I had bought a very fine copy  of Taylor, the Water Poet. \"Oh, yes, sir,\" he said, \"I saw it; but not  quite so fine as mine.\" He went up to Highgate to look through the  engravings of Charles Matthews the elder. They were all duplicates--of  course inferior ones. \"Damn him, sir!\" cried Matthews afterwards to a  friend; \"I should like him to have had a duplicate of my wooden leg.\"    John Payne Collier, who was born a year before Daniel, but who lived  until 1883, was a collector with very similar tastes. He had been a  reporter on the _Morning Chronicle_, and in all probability imbibed some  of his book-collecting zeal from Perry. His book-buying and literary  career commenced, according to his own account, in 1804 or 1805, when  his father took him into the shop of Thomas Rodd, senior, on which  occasion he purchased his 'first Old English book of any value,' namely,  Wilson's 'Art of Logic,' printed by Grafton, 1551; from this he  ascertained that 'Ralf Roister Doister' was an older play than 'Gammer  Gurton's Needle,' and also that it was by Nicholas Udal, Master of Eton  School. When in Holland, in the winter of 1813-14, Collier purchased  among other books an imperfect copy of Tyndale's 'Gospel of St.  Matthew,' to which, as he says in his 'Diary,' 'the date of 1526 [1525]  has been assigned, and which seems to be the very earliest translation  into English of any portion of the New Testament. Many years  afterwards--I think in the spring of 1832--I happened to show it to  Rodd, the learned bookseller. I was at that time ignorant on the  subject, and Rodd offered me books to the value of two or three pounds  for it. I gladly accepted them.' This fragment, for which Collier paid a  florin, was sold to Mr. Grenville by Rodd for L50, and is now in the  British Museum. Writing in the _Athenaeum_, January 31, 1852, he gives an  account of the origin of events which led to one of the fiercest  literary quarrels of modern times: 'A short time before the death of the  late Mr. Rodd, of Newport Street [_i.e._ early in 1849], I happened to  be in his shop when a considerable parcel of books arrived from the  country. He told me that they had been bought for him at an auction--I  think in Bedfordshire. . . . He unpacked them in my presence . . . and  there were two which attracted my attention, one being a fine copy of  Florio's \"Italian Dictionary,\" of the edition of 1611, and the other a  much-thumbed, abused, and imperfect copy of the Second Folio of  Shakespeare, 1632. The first I did not possess, and the last I was  willing to buy, inasmuch as I apprehended it would add some missing  leaves to a copy of the same impression which I had had for some time on  my shelves. As was his usual course, Mr. Rodd required a very reasonable  price for both; for the first I remember I gave 12s. and for the last  only L1 10s. . . . On the outside of one of the covers was inscribed,  \"Tho. Perkins, his booke.\"' Collier was vexed at finding that the volume  contained no leaves which would help him in completing the volume he  already had. He had employed another person to do the collating, and it  was not until some considerable time after, and on examining thoroughly  the volume himself, that he discovered it to contain a large series of  emendations, which Collier included in his 'Notes and Emendations to the  Text of Shakespeare's Plays,' 1853, which set the whole town by the  ears. Collier's library was dispersed at Sotheby's in 1884; it was an  unusually interesting sale, and included many very rare and curious  books.    [Illustration: _Samuel Taylor Coleridge._    From the Portrait by G. Dawe, R.A., 1812.]    Southey, Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Wordsworth, and William Hazlitt were  book-collectors of a type which deserves a niche to itself. Writing to  Coleridge in 1797, Lamb says: 'I have had thoughts of turning Quaker,  and have been reading, or am, rather, just beginning to read, a most  capital book, good thoughts in good language, William Penn's \"No Cross,  no Crown.\" I like it immensely.' Lamb's ideas of book-marking are to be  found in his correspondence with Coleridge, in which he states that a  book reads the better when the topography of its plots and notes is  thoroughly mastered, and when we 'can trace the dirt in it, to having  read it at tea with buttered muffins, or over a pipe.' Lamb's library  consisted for the most part of tattered volumes in a dreadful state of  repair. Lamb, like Young, the poet, dog-eared his books to such an  extent that many of them would hardly close at all. From the  correspondence of Bernard Barton we get a glimpse at Lamb's cottage in  Colebrook Row, Islington--a white house with six good rooms. 'You enter  without passage into a cheerful dining-room, all studded over and rough  with old books.' Barton also writes: 'What chiefly attracted me was a  large old book-case full of books. I could but think how many long walks  must have been taken to bring them home, for there were but few that  did not bear the mark of having been bought at many a bookstall--brown,  dark-looking books, distinguished by those white tickets which told how  much their owner had given for each.'    [Illustration: _Lamb's Cottage at Colebrook Row, Islington._]    In an edition of Donne [? 1669] which belonged to Lamb, Coleridge  scrawled: 'I shall die soon, my dear Charles Lamb, and then you will not  be vexed that I have be-scribbled your book. S. T. C., 2nd May, 1811.'  Lamb was too good-natured to be a book-collector. On one occasion  William Hazlitt[77:A] sent Martin Burney to Lamb to borrow Wordsworth's  'Excursion,' and Lamb being out, Burney took it, a high-handed  proceeding which involved the borrower in a blowing-up. Coleridge at  another time helped himself to Luther's 'Table-Talk,' and this also  called forth a great outcry. A copy of Chapman's Homer, which passed  through the hands of Wordsworth and S. T. Coleridge, eventually turned  up in one of Lilly's catalogues. This identical copy is noticed in an  account of Rydal Mount which appeared in the first volume of _Once a  Week_. Coleridge, of course, has made a number of notes in it, and in  one of these he describes the translation as 'an exquisite poem, spite  of its frequent and perverse quaintness and harshnesses,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#19)"],[1,"high price it commands, it has probably  been the only American book-plate ever counterfeited. At an auction sale  of books in Washington in 1863, this counterfeit plate had been placed in  many books to give a fictitious value, but the fraud was discovered and  announced by the present writer, just before the books were sold. Yet the  sale was attended by many attracted to bid upon books said to have been  owned by Washington, and among them the late Dr. W. F. Poole, then  librarian of the Boston Athenaeum, which possesses most of the library  authentically known to have been at Mount Vernon.    John Adams and John Quincy Adams used book-plates, and James Monroe and  John Tyler each had a plain name-label. These are all of our presidents  known to have used them, except General Garfield, who had a printed  book-plate of simple design, with the motto \"_inter folia fructus_.\"  Eleven of the signers of the Declaration of Independence are known to  have had these signs of gentle birth--for in the early years of the  American Colonies, it was only the families of aristocratic connection  and scholarly tastes who indulged in what may be termed a superfluous  luxury.    The plates used among the Southern settlers were generally ordered from  England, and not at all American. The Northern plates were more  frequently of native design and execution, and therefore of much greater  value and interest, though far inferior in style of workmanship and  elaboration of ornament to the best European ones.    The ordinary library label is also a book-plate, and some of the early  libraries and small collections have elaborate designs. The early Harvard  College library plate was a large and fine piece of engraving by Hurd.  The Harvard Library had some few of this fine engraved label printed in  red ink, and placed in the rarer books of the library--as a reminder that  the works containing the rubricated book-plates were not to be drawn out  by students.    The learned bibliophile and librarian of Florence, Magliabecchi, who died  in 1714, devised for his library of thirty thousand volumes, which he  bequeathed to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, a book-plate representing his  own profile on a medal surrounded with books and oak boughs, with the  inscription--\"Antonius Magliabecchius Florentinus.\"    Some book-plates embody designs of great beauty. The late George  Bancroft's, engraved on copper, represented a winged cherub (from  Raphael) gazing sun-ward, holding a tablet with the inscription \"_Eis  phaos_,\" toward the light.    Some French book-plates aim at humor or caricature. One familiar example  represents an old book-worm mounted on a tall ladder in a library,  profoundly absorbed in reading, and utterly unconscious that the room  beneath him is on fire.    To those who ask of what possible utility it can be to cultivate so  unfruitful a pursuit as the devising or the collecting of book-plates, it  may be pertinent to state the claim made in behalf of the amateurs of  this art, by a connoisseur, namely, \"Book-plates foster the study of art,  history, genealogy, and human character.\" On this theory, we may add, the  coat of arms or family crest teaches heraldry; the mottoes or  inscriptions chosen cultivate the taste for language and sententious  literature; the engraving appeals to the sense of the artistic; the names  of early or ancient families who are often thus commemorated teach  biography, history, or genealogy; while the great variety of sentiments  selected for the plates illustrate the character and taste of those  selecting them.    On the other hand, it must be said that the coat of arms fails to  indicate individual taste or genius, and might better be supplanted by  original and characteristic designs, especially such as relate to books,  libraries, and learning.          CHAPTER 5.    THE ENEMIES OF BOOKS.      We have seen in former chapters how the books of a library are acquired,  how they are prepared for the shelves, or for use, and how they are or  should be bound. Let us now consider the important questions which  involve the care, the protection, and the preservation of the books.    Every librarian or book owner should be something more than a custodian  of the books in his collection. He should also exercise perpetual  vigilance with regard to their safety and condition. The books of every  library are beset by dangers and by enemies. Some of these are open and  palpable; others are secret, illusive, little suspected, and liable to  come unlooked for and without warning. Some of these enemies are  impersonal and immaterial, but none the less deadly; others are  personally human in form, but most inhuman in their careless and brutal  treatment of books. How far and how fatally the books of many libraries  have been injured by these ever active and persistent enemies can never  be adequately told. But we may point out what the several dangers are  which beset them, and how far the watchful care of the librarian and his  assistants may fore-stall or prevent them.    One of the foremost of the inanimate enemies of books is dust. In some  libraries the atmosphere is dust-laden, to a degree which seems  incredible until you witness its results in the deposits upon books,  which soil your fingers, and contaminate the air you breathe, as you  brush or blow it away. Peculiarly liable to dust are library rooms  located in populous towns, or in business streets, and built close to  the avenues of traffic. Here, the dust is driven in at the windows and  doors by every breeze that blows. It is an omnipresent evil, that cannot  be escaped or very largely remedied. As preventive measures, care should  be taken not to build libraries too near the street, but to have ample  front and side yards to isolate the books as far as may be consistent  with convenient access. Where the library is already located immediately  on the street, a subscription for sprinkling the thoroughfare with water,  the year round, would be true economy.    In some cities, the evils of street dust are supplemented by the  mischiefs of coal smoke, to an aggravated degree. Wherever soft coal is  burned as the principal fuel, a black, fuliginous substance goes floating  through the air, and soils every thing it touches. It penetrates into  houses and public buildings, often intensified by their own interior use  of the same generator of dirt, and covers the books of the library with  its foul deposits. You may see, in the public libraries of some western  cities, how this perpetual curse of coal smoke has penetrated the leaves  of all the books, resisting all efforts to keep it out, and slowly but  surely deteriorating both paper and bindings. Here, preventive measures  are impossible, unless some device for consuming the coal smoke of  chimneys and factories were made compulsory, or the evil somewhat  mitigated by using a less dangerous fuel within the library.    But, aside from these afflictions of dust, in its most aggravated form,  every library and every room in any building is subject to its persistent  visitations. Wherever carpets or rugs cover the floors, there dust has an  assured abiding-place, and it is diffused throughout the apartment in  impalpable clouds, at every sweeping of the floors. Hence it would be  wise to adopt in public libraries a floor-covering like linoleum, or some  substance other than woolen, which would be measurably free from dust,  while soft enough to deaden the sound of feet upon the floors. Even with  this preventive precaution, there will always be dust enough, and too  much for comfort, or for the health of the books. Only a thorough  dusting, carried on if possible daily, can prevent an accumulation of  dust, at once deleterious to the durability of the books, and to the  comfort both of librarians and readers. Dust is an insidious foe,  stealing on its march silently and unobserved, yet, however impalpable in  the atmosphere of a library, it will settle upon the tops of every shelf  of books, it will penetrate their inner leaves, it will lodge upon the  bindings, soiling books and readers, and constituting a perpetual  annoyance.    It is not enough to dust the tops of the books periodically; a more full  and radical remedy is required, to render library books presentable. At  no long intervals, there should be a thorough library cleaning, as  drastic and complete as the house-cleaning which neat housewives  institute twice a year, with such wholesome results. The books are to be  taken down from the shelves, and subjected to a shaking-up process, which  will remove more of the dust they have absorbed than any brush can reach.  To do this effectually, take them, if of moderate thickness, by the  half-dozen at a time from the shelf, hold them loosely on a table, their  fronts downward, backs uppermost, then with a hand at either side of the  little pile, strike them smartly together a few times, until the dust,  which will fly from them in a very palpable cloud, ceases to fall. Then  lay them on their ends, with the tops uppermost on the table, and repeat  the concussion in that posture, when you will eliminate a fresh crop of  dust, though not so thick as the first. After this, let each volume of  the lot be brushed over at the sides and back with a soft (never stiff)  brush, or else with a piece of cotton or woolen cloth, and so restored  clean to the shelves. While this thorough method of cleansing will take  time and pains, it will pay in the long run. It will not eliminate all  the dust (which in a large collection is a physical impossibility) but it  will reduce it to a minimum. Faithfully carried out, as a periodical  supplement to a daily dusting of the books as they stand on the shelves,  it will immensely relieve the librarian or book-owner, who can then, (and  then only) feel that he has done his whole duty by his books.    Another dangerous enemy of the library book is damp, already"]]]
