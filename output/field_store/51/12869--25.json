And he came up with the fair Princess Marya Morevna    as she was going her way, laid hold of her, and carried her off    home with him. But Prince Ivan wept full sore, and he arrayed    himself and set out a wandering, saying to himself: \"Whatever    happens, I will go and look for Marya Morevna!\"      One day passed, another day passed: at the dawn of the    third day he saw a wondrous palace, and by the side of the palace    stood an oak, and on the oak sat a falcon bright. Down flew    the Falcon from the oak, smote upon the ground, turned into a    brave youth and cried aloud:      \"Ha, dear brother-in-law! how deals the Lord with you?\"      Out came running the Princess Marya, joyfully greeted her    brother Ivan, and began enquiring after his health, and telling    him all about herself. The Prince spent three days with them,    then he said:      \"I cannot abide with you; I must go in search of my wife    the fair Princess Marya Morevna.\"      \"Hard will it be for you to find her,\" answered the Falcon.    \"At all events leave with us your silver spoon. We will look at    it and remember you.\" So Prince Ivan left his silver spoon at    the Falcon's, and went on his way again.      On he went one day, on he went another day, and by the    dawn of the third day he saw a palace still grander than the former    one, and hard by the palace stood an oak, and on the oak    sat an eagle. Down flew the eagle from the oak, smote upon    the ground, turned into a brave youth, and cried aloud:      \"Rise up, Princess Olga! Hither comes our brother dear!\"      The Princess Olga immediately ran to meet him, and began    kissing him and embracing him, asking after his health and telling    him all about herself. With them Prince Ivan stopped three    days; then he said:      \"I cannot stay here any longer. I am going to look for my    wife, the fair Princess Marya Morevna.\"      \"Hard will it be for you to find her,\" replied the Eagle,    \"Leave with us a silver fork. We will look at it and remember    you.\"      He left a silver fork behind, and went his way. He travelled    one day, he travelled two days; at daybreak on the third day he    saw a palace grander than the first two, and near the palace    stood an oak, and on the oak sat a raven. Down flew the Raven    from the oak, smote upon the ground, turned into a brave youth,    and cried aloud:      \"Princess Anna, come forth quickly! our brother is coming!\"      Out ran the Princess Anna, greeted him joyfully, and began    kissing and embracing him, asking after his health and telling    him all about herself. Prince Ivan stayed with them three days;    then he said:      \"Farewell! I am going to look for my wife, the fair Princess    Marya Morevna.\"      \"Hard will it be for you to find her,\" replied the Raven,    \"Anyhow, leave your silver snuff-box with us. We will look at    it and remember you.\"      The Prince handed over his silver snuff-box, took his leave    and went his way. One day he went, another day he went, and    on the third day he came to where Marya Morevna was. She    caught sight of her love, flung her arms around his neck, burst    into tears, and exclaimed:      \"Oh, Prince Ivan! why did you disobey me, and go looking    into the closet and letting out Koshchei the Deathless?\"      \"Forgive me, Marya Morevna! Remember not the past;    much better fly with me while Koshchei the Deathless is out of    sight. Perhaps he won't catch us.\"      So they got ready and fled. Now Koshchei was out hunting.    Towards evening he was returning home, when his good steed    stumbled beneath him.      \"Why stumblest thou, sorry jade? scentest thou some ill?\"      The steed replied:      \"Prince Ivan has come and carried off Marya Morevna.\"      \"Is it possible to catch them?\"      \"It is possible to sow wheat, to wait till it grows up, to reap    it and thresh it, to grind it to flour, to make five pies of it, to    eat those pies, and then to start in pursuit--and even then to be    in time.\"      Koshchei galloped off and caught up Prince Ivan.      \"Now,\" says he, \"this time I will forgive you, in return for    your kindness in giving me water to drink. And a second time    I will forgive you; but the third time beware! I will cut you to    bits.\"      Then he took Marya Morevna from him, and carried her off.    But Prince Ivan sat down on a stone and burst into tears. He    wept and wept--and then returned back again to Marya Morevna.    Now Koshchei the Deathless happened not to be at home.      \"Let us fly, Marya Morevna!\"      \"Ah, Prince Ivan! he will catch us.\"      \"Suppose he does catch us. At all events we shall have    spent an hour or two together.\"      So they got ready and fled. As Koshchei the Deathless was    returning home, his good steed stumbled beneath him.      \"Why stumblest thou, sorry jade? scentest thou some    ill?\"      \"Prince Ivan has come and carried off Marya Morevna.\"      \"Is it possible to catch them?\"      \"It is possible to sow barley, to wait till it grows up, to reap    it and thresh it, to brew beer, to drink ourselves drunk on it,    to sleep our fill, and then to set off in pursuit--and yet to be in    time.\"      Koshchei galloped off, caught up Prince Ivan:      \"Didn't I tell you that you should not see Marya Morevna    any more than your own ears?\"      And he took her away and carried her off home with him.      Prince Ivan was left there alone. He wept and wept; then    he went back again after Marya Morevna. Koshchei happened    to be away from home at that moment.      \"Let us fly, Marya Morevna.\"      \"Ah, Prince Ivan! He is sure to catch us and hew you in    pieces.\"      \"Let him hew away! I cannot live without you.\"      So they got ready and fled.      Koshchei the Deathless was returning home when his good    steed stumbled beneath him.      \"Why stumblest thou? scentest thou any ill?\"      \"Prince Ivan has come and has carried off Marya Morevna.\"      Koshchei galloped off, caught Prince Ivan, chopped him into    little pieces, put them in a barrel, smeared it with pitch and    bound it with iron hoops, and flung it into the blue sea. But    Marya Morevna he carried off home.      At that very time, the silver turned black which Prince Ivan    had left with his brothers-in-law.      \"Ah!\" said they, \"the evil is accomplished sure enough!\"      Then the Eagle hurried to the blue sea, caught hold of the    barrel, and dragged it ashore; the Falcon flew away for the    Water of Life, and the Raven for the Water of Death.      Afterwards they all three met, broke open the barrel, took out    the remains of Prince Ivan, washed them, and put them together    in fitting order. The Raven sprinkled them with the Water of    Death--the pieces joined together, the body became whole. The    Falcon sprinkled it with the Water of Life--Prince Ivan shuddered,    stood up, and said:      \"Ah! what a time I've been sleeping!\"      \"You'd have gone on sleeping a good deal longer, if it hadn't    been for us,\" replied his brothers-in-law. \"Now come and pay    us a visit.\"      \"Not so, brothers; I shall go and look for Marya Morevna.\"      And when he had found her, he said to her:      \"Find out from Koshchei the Deathless whence he got so    good a steed.\"      So Marya Morevna chose a favorable moment, and began    asking Koshchei about it. Koshchei replied:      \"Beyond thrice nine lands, in the thirtieth kingdom, on the    other side of the fiery river, there lives a Baba Yaga. She has    so good a mare that she flies right round the world on it every    day. And she has many other splendid mares. I watched her    herds for three days without losing a single mare, and in return    for that the Baba Yaga gave me a foal.\"      \"But how did you get across the fiery river?\"      \"Why, I've a handkerchief of this kind--when I wave it    thrice on the right hand, there springs up a very lofty bridge and    the fire cannot reach it.\"      Marya Morevna listened to all this, and repeated it to Prince    Ivan, and she carried off the handkerchief and gave it to him.    So he managed to get across the fiery river, and then went on to    the Baba Yaga's. Long went he on without getting anything    either to eat or to drink. At last he came across an outlandish[103]    bird and its young ones. Says Prince Ivan:      \"I'll eat one of these chickens.\"      \"Don't eat it, Prince Ivan!\" begs the outlandish bird;    \"some time or other I'll do you a good turn.\"      He went on farther and saw a hive of bees in the forest.      \"I'll get a bit of honeycomb,\" says he.      \"Don't disturb my honey, Prince Ivan!\" exclaims the queen    bee; \"some time or other I'll do you a good turn.\"      So he didn't disturb it, but went on. Presently there met    him a lioness with her cub.      \"Anyhow I'll eat this lion cub,\" says he; \"I'm so hungry, I    feel quite unwell!\"      \"Please let us alone, Prince Ivan,\" begs the lioness; \"some    time or other I'll do you a good turn.\"      \"Very well; have it your own way,\" says he.      Hungry and faint he wandered on, walked farther and farther    and at last came to where stood the house of the Baba Yaga.    Round the house were set twelve poles in a circle, and on each    of eleven of these poles was stuck a human head, the twelfth    alone remained unoccupied.      \"Hail, granny!\"      \"Hail, Prince Ivan! wherefore have you come? Is it of your    own accord, or on compulsion?\"      \"I have come to earn from you a heroic steed.\"      \"So be it, Prince, you won't have to serve a year with me, but    just three days. If you take good care of my mares, I'll give you    a heroic steed. But if you don't--why then you mustn't be    annoyed at finding your head stuck on top of the last pole up    there."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22381"],[0,"Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome (#19)"],[1,"Iphigenia's brother, and  Pylades her cousin, and their object in undertaking an expedition fraught  with so much peril, was to obtain the statue of the Taurian Artemis.  Orestes, having incurred the anger of the Furies for avenging the murder of  his father Agamemnon, was pursued by them wherever he went, until at last  he was informed by the oracle of Delphi that, in order to pacify them, he  must convey the image of the Taurian Artemis from Tauris to Attica. This he  at once resolved to do, and accompanied by his faithful friend Pylades, who  insisted on sharing the dangers of the undertaking, he set out for Taurica.  But the unfortunate youths had hardly stepped on shore before they were  seized by the natives, who, as usual, conveyed them for sacrifice to the  temple of Artemis. Iphigenia, discovering that they were Greeks, though  unaware of their near relationship to herself, thought the {96} opportunity  a favourable one for sending tidings of her existence to her native  country, and, accordingly, requested one of the strangers to be the bearer  of a letter from her to her family. A magnanimous dispute now arose between  the friends, and each besought the other to accept the precious privilege  of life and freedom. Pylades, at length overcome by the urgent entreaties  of Orestes, agreed to be the bearer of the missive, but on looking more  closely at the superscription, he observed, to his intense surprise, that  it was addressed to Orestes. Hereupon an explanation followed; the brother  and sister recognized each other, amid joyful tears and loving embraces,  and assisted by her friends and kinsmen, Iphigenia escaped with them from a  country where she had spent so many unhappy days, and witnessed so many  scenes of horror and anguish.    The fugitives, having contrived to obtain the image of the Taurian Artemis,  carried it with them to Brauron in Attica. This divinity was henceforth  known as the Brauronian Artemis, and the rites which had rendered her  worship so infamous in Taurica were now introduced into Greece, and human  victims bled freely under the sacrificial knife, both in Athens and Sparta.  The revolting practice of offering human sacrifices to her, was continued  until the time of Lycurgus, the great Spartan lawgiver, who put an end to  it by substituting in its place one, which was hardly less barbarous,  namely, the scourging of youths, who were whipped on the altars of the  Brauronian Artemis in the most cruel manner; sometimes indeed they expired  under the lash, in which case their mothers, far from lamenting their fate,  are said to have rejoiced, considering this an honourable death for their  sons.    SELENE-ARTEMIS.    Hitherto we have seen Artemis only in the various phases of her terrestrial  character; but just as her brother Apollo drew into himself by degrees the  attributes of that more ancient divinity Helios, the sun-god, so, in like  manner, she came to be identified in later times {97} with Selene, the  moon-goddess, in which character she is always represented as wearing on  her forehead a glittering crescent, whilst a flowing veil, bespangled with  stars, reaches to her feet, and a long robe completely envelops her.    DIANA.    The Diana of the Romans was identified with the Greek Artemis, with whom  she shares that peculiar tripartite character, which so strongly marks the  individuality of the Greek goddess. In heaven she was Luna (the moon), on  earth Diana (the huntress-goddess), and in the lower world Proserpine; but,  unlike the Ephesian Artemis, Diana, in her character as Proserpine, carries  with her into the lower world no element of love or sympathy; she is, on  the contrary, characterized by practices altogether hostile to man, such as  the exercise of witchcraft, evil charms, and other antagonistic influences,  and is, in fact, the Greek Hecate, in her later development.    The statues of Diana were generally erected at a point where three roads  met, for which reason she is called Trivia (from _tri_, three, and _via_,  way).    A temple was dedicated to her on the Aventine hill by Servius Tullius, who  is said to have first introduced the worship of this divinity into Rome.    The Nemoralia, or Grove Festivals, were celebrated in her honour on the  13th of August, on the Lacus Nemorensis, or forest-buried lake, near  Aricia. The priest who officiated in her temple on this spot, was always a  fugitive slave, who had gained his office by murdering his predecessor, and  hence was constantly armed, in order that he might thus be prepared to  encounter a new aspirant.    HEPHAESTUS (VULCAN).    Hephaestus, the son of Zeus and Hera, was the god of fire in its beneficial  aspect, and the presiding deity over all workmanship accomplished by means  of this useful element. He was universally honoured, not only as the {98}  god of all mechanical arts, but also as a house and hearth divinity, who  exercised a beneficial influence on civilized society in general. Unlike  the other Greek divinities, he was ugly and deformed, being awkward in his  movements, and limping in his gait. This latter defect originated, as we  have already seen, in the wrath of his father Zeus, who hurled him down  from heaven[35] in consequence of his taking the part of Hera, in one of  the domestic disagreements, which so frequently arose between this royal  pair. Hephaestus was a whole day falling from Olympus to the earth, where he  at length alighted on the island of Lemnos. The inhabitants of the country,  seeing him descending through the air, received him in their arms; but in  spite of their care, his leg was broken by the fall, and he remained ever  afterwards lame in one foot. Grateful for the kindness of the Lemnians, he  henceforth took up his abode in their island, and there built for himself a  superb palace, and forges for the pursuit of his avocation. He instructed  the people how to work in metals, and also taught them other valuable and  useful arts.    It is said that the first work of Hephaestus was a most ingenious throne of  gold, with secret springs, which he presented to Hera. It was arranged in  such a manner that, once seated, she found herself unable to move, and  though all the gods endeavoured to extricate her, their efforts were  unavailing. Hephaestus thus revenged himself on his mother for the cruelty  she had always displayed towards him, on account of his want of comeliness  and grace. Dionysus, the wine god, contrived, however, to intoxicate  Hephaestus, and then induced him to return to Olympus, where, after having  released the {99} queen of heaven from her very undignified position, he  became reconciled to his parents.    He now built for himself a glorious palace on Olympus, of shining gold, and  made for the other deities those magnificent edifices which they inhabited.  He was assisted in his various and exquisitely skilful works of art, by two  female statues of pure gold, formed by his own hand, which possessed the  power of motion, and always accompanied him wherever he went. With the  assistance of the Cyclops, he forged for Zeus his wonderful thunderbolts,  thus investing his mighty father with a new power of terrible import. Zeus  testified his appreciation of this precious gift, by bestowing upon  Hephaestus the beautiful Aphrodite in marriage,[36] but this was a  questionable boon; for the lovely Aphrodite, who was the personification of  all grace and beauty, felt no affection for her ungainly and unattractive  spouse, and amused herself by ridiculing his awkward movements and  unsightly person. On one occasion especially, when Hephaestus good-naturedly  took upon himself the office of cup-bearer to the gods, his hobbling gait  and extreme awkwardness created the greatest mirth amongst the celestials,  in which his disloyal partner was the first to join, with unconcealed  merriment.    Aphrodite greatly preferred Ares to her husband, and this preference  naturally gave rise to much jealousy on the part of Hephaestus, and caused  them great unhappiness.    Hephaestus appears to have been an indispensable member of the Olympic  Assembly, where he plays the part of smith, armourer, chariot-builder, &c.  As already mentioned, he constructed the palaces where the gods resided,  fashioned the golden shoes with which they trod the air or water, built for  them their wonderful chariots, and shod with brass the horses of celestial  breed, which conveyed these glittering equipages over land and sea. He also  made the tripods which moved of themselves in and out of the celestial  halls, formed for Zeus the {100} far-famed aegis, and erected the  magnificent palace of the sun. He also created the brazen-footed bulls of  Aetes, which breathed flames from their nostrils, sent forth clouds of  smoke, and filled the air with their roaring.    Among his most renowned works of art for the use of mortals were: the  armour of Achilles and AEneas, the beautiful necklace of Harmonia, and the  crown of Ariadne; but his masterpiece was Pandora, of whom a detailed  account has already been given.    [Illustration]    There was a temple on Mount Etna erected in his honour, which none but the  pure and virtuous were permitted to enter. The entrance to this temple was  guarded by dogs, which possessed the extraordinary faculty of being able to  discriminate between the righteous and the unrighteous, fawning upon and  caressing the good, whilst they rushed upon all evil-doers and drove them  away.    Hephaestus is usually represented as a powerful, brawny, and very muscular  man of middle height and mature age; his strong uplifted arm is raised in  the act of striking the anvil with a hammer, which he holds in one hand,  whilst with the other he is turning a thunderbolt, which an eagle beside  him is waiting to carry to Zeus. The principal seat of his worship was the  island of Lemnos, where he was regarded with peculiar veneration.    VULCAN.    The Roman Vulcan"]]]
