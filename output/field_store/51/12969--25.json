Then why do they not so take this Red, binding  his arms to his sides?\" The suspicion in Nolan's voice was plain.    \"Perhaps in them is some conditioned control making it so that they  cannot attack their rulers--\"    \"I do not like this matter of machines which can play this way and that  with minds and bodies!\" flared Nolan. \"A man should only _use_ a weapon,  not be one!\"    Travis could agree to that. Had they by the wreck of their own ship and  the death of Ruthven, escaped just such an existence as these Tatars now  endured? If so, why? He and all the Apaches were volunteers, eager and  willing to form new world colonies. What had happened back on Terra that  they had been so ruthlessly sent out without warning and under Redax?  Another small piece of that puzzle, or maybe the heart of the whole  picture snapped into place. Had the project learned in some way of the  Tatar settlement on Topaz and so been forced to speed up that  translation from late twentieth-century Americans to primitives? That  would explain a lot!    Travis returned abruptly to the matter now at hand as he saw a peak  ahead. The party they were trailing was heading directly for the outlaw  hide-out. Travis hoped Menlik had warned them in time. There--that wall  of cliff to his left must shelter the valley of the towers, though it  was still miles ahead. Travis did not believe the hunters would be able  to reach their goal unless they traveled at night. They might not know  of the ape-things which could menace the dark.    But the enemy, whether he knew of such dangers or not, did not intend to  press on. As the sun pulled away, leaving crevices and crannies shadow  dark, the hunters stopped to make camp. The Apaches, after their custom  on the war trail, gathered on the heights above.    \"This Red seems to think that he shall find those he seeks sitting  waiting for him, as if their feet were nipped tight in a trap,\" Tsoay  remarked.    \"It is the habit of the Pinda-lick-o-yi,\" Lupe added, \"to believe they  are greater than all others. Yet this one is a stupid fool walking into  the arms of a she-bear with a cub.\" He chuckled.    \"A man with a rifle does not fear a man armed only with a stick,\" Travis  cut in quickly. \"This one is armed with a weapon which he has good  reason to believe makes him invulnerable to attack. If he rests tonight,  he probably leaves his machine on guard.\"    \"At least we are sure of one thing,\" Nolan said in half agreement. \"This  one does not suspect that there are any in these hills save those he can  master. And his machine does not work against us. Thus at dawn--\" He  made a swift gesture, and they smiled in concert.    At dawn--the old time of attack. An Apache does not attack at night.  Travis was not sure that any of them could break that old taboo and  creep down upon the camp before the coming of new light.    But tomorrow morning they would take over this confident Red, strip him  of his enslaving machine.    Travis' head jerked. It had come as suddenly as a blow between his  eyes--to half stun him. What ... what was it? Not any physical  impact--no, something which was dazing but still immaterial. He braced  his whole body, awaiting its return, trying frantically to understand  what had happened in that instant of vertigo and seeming disembodiment.  Never had he experienced anything like it--or had he? Two years or more  ago when he had gone through the time transfer to enter the Arizona of  the Folsom Men some ten thousand years earlier--that moment of transfer  had been something like this, a sensation of being awry in space and  time with no stable footing to be found.    Yet he was lying here on very tangible rock and soil, and nothing about  him in the shadow-hung landscape of Topaz had changed in the slightest.  But that blow had left behind it a quivering residue of panic buried far  inside him, a tender spot like an open wound.    Travis drew a deep breath which was almost a sob, levered himself up on  one elbow to stare intently down into the enemy camp. Was this some  attack from the other's unknown weapon? Suddenly he was not at all sure  what might happen when the Apaches made that dawn rush.    Jil-Lee was in station on his right. Travis must compare notes with him  to be sure that this was not indeed a trap. Better to retreat now than  to be taken like fish in a net. He crept out of his place, gave the  chittering signal call of the fluff-ball, and heard Jil-Lee's answer in  a cleverly mimicked trill of a night insect.    \"Did you feel something just now--in your head?\" Travis found it  difficult to put that sensation into words.    \"Not so. But you did?\"    He had--of course, he had! The remains of it were still in him, that  point of panic. \"Yes.\"    \"The machine?\"    \"I don't know.\" Travis' confusion grew. It might be that he alone of the  party had been struck. If so, he could be a danger to his own kind.    \"This is not good. I think we had better hold council, away from here.\"  Jil-Lee's whisper was the merest ghost of sound. He chirped again to be  answered from Tsoay upslope, who passed on the signal.    The first moon was high in the sky as the Apaches gathered together.  Again Travis asked his question: Had any of the others felt that odd  blow? He was met by negatives.    But Nolan had the final word: \"This is not good,\" he echoed Jil-Lee's  comment. \"If it was the Red machine at work, then we may all be swept  into his net along with those he seeks. Perhaps the longer one remains  close to that thing, the more influence it gains over him. We shall stay  here until dawn. If the enemy would reach the place they seek, then they  must pass below us, for that is the easiest road. Burdened with his  machine, that Red has ever taken the easiest way. So, we shall see if he  also has a defense against these when they come without warning.\" He  touched the arrows in his quiver.    To kill from ambush meant that they might never learn the secret of the  machine, but after his experience Travis was willing to admit that  Nolan's caution was the wise way. Travis wanted no part of a second  attack like that which had shaken him so. And Nolan had not ordered a  general retreat. It must be in the war chief's thoughts as it was in  Travis' that if the machine could have an influence over Apaches, it  must cease to function.    They set their ambush with the age-old skill the Redax had grafted into  their memories. Then there was nothing to do but wait.    It was an hour after dawn when Tsoay signaled that the enemy was coming,  and shortly after, they heard the thud of ponies' hoofs. The first Tatar  plodded into view, and by the stance of his body in the saddle, Travis  knew the Red had him under full control. Two, then three Tatars passed  between the teeth of the Apache trap. The fourth one had allowed a wider  gap to open between himself and his fellows.    Then the Red leader came. His face below the bulge of the helmet was not  happy. Travis believed the man was not a horseman by inclination. The  Apache set arrow to bow cord, and at the chirp from Nolan, fired in  concert with his clansmen.    Only one of those arrows found a target. The Red's pony gave a shrill  scream of pain and terror, reared, pawing at the air, toppled back,  pinning its shouting rider under it.    The Red had had a defense right enough, one which had somehow deflected  the arrows. But he neither had protection against his own awkward seat  in the saddle nor the arrow which had seriously wounded the now  threshing pony.    Ahead the Tatars twisted and writhed, mouthed tortured cries, then  dropped out of their saddles to lie limply on the ground as if the  arrows aimed at the master had instead struck each to the heart.          11      Either the Red was lucky, or his reactions were quick. He had somehow  rolled clear of the struggling horse as Lupe leaped from behind a  boulder, knife out and ready. To the eyes of the Apaches the helmeted  man lay easy prey to Lupe's attack. Nor did he raise an arm to defend  himself, though one hand lay free across the plate on his chest.    But the young Apache stumbled, rebounding back as if he had run into an  unseen wall--when his knife was still six inches away from the other.  Lupe cried out, shook under a second impact as the Red fired an  automatic with his other hand.    Travis dropped his bow, returned to the most primitive weapon of all.  His hand closed around a stone and he hurled the fist-sized oval  straight at the helmet so clearly outlined against the rocks below.    But even as Lupe's knife had never touched flesh, so was the rock  deflected; the Red was covered by some protective field. This was  certainly nothing the Apaches had seen before. Nolan's whistle summoned  them to draw back.    The Red fired again, the sharp bark of the hand gun harsh and loud. He  did not have any real target, for with the exception of Lupe the Apaches  had gone to earth. Between the rocks the Red was struggling to his feet,  but he moved slowly, favoring his side and one leg; he had not come  totally unharmed from his tumble with the pony.    An armed enemy who could not be touched--one who knew there were more  than outlaws in this region. The Red leader was far more of a threat to  the Apaches now than he had ever been. He must not be allowed to escape.    He was holstering his gun, moving along with one hand against the rocks  to steady himself, trying to reach one of the ponies that stood with  trailing reins beside the inert Tatars.    But when the enemy reached the far side of that rock he would have to  sacrifice either his steadying hold, or his touch on the chest plate  where his other hand rested. Would he, then, for an instant be  vulnerable?    The pony!    Travis put an arrow on bow cord and shot.

The king was greatly  astonished, and while he was engaged in deep thought about the matter  the palace was suddenly lit up by lights of dazzling brightness. On  inquiring into the cause he learnt that the little princess had opened  her eyes, and that they shone with matchless brilliancy.    At first the king could not speak, so amazed was he. He laughed and he  cried, he sorrowed and he rejoiced, and in the midst of it all a  deputation of ministers and senators was announced. When these were  shown into his presence they fell on their knees, and striking the  ground with their foreheads, said, \"Sire, save your people and your  royal person. The queen and her twelve maids of honour have been  presented by the Spirit of the Steppes with thirteen girl babies. We  beseech you to have these children killed, or we shall all be  destroyed.\"    The king, roused to anger, gave orders that all the babies should be  thrown into the sea. The courtiers were already on their way to obey  this cruel command when the queen entered, weeping, and pale as death.  She threw herself at the king's feet and begged him to spare the lives  of these helpless and innocent children, and instead to let them be  placed on a desert island and there left in the hands of God.    The king granted her wish. The baby princess was placed in a golden  cradle, her little companions in copper cradles, and the thirteen were  taken to a desert island and left quite alone. Every one at court  thought that they had perished, and said one to another, \"They will  die from cold and hunger; they will be devoured by wild beasts, or  birds of prey; they are sure to die; perchance they will be buried  under dead leaves or covered with snow.\" But happily nothing of the  kind happened, for God takes care of little children.    The small princess grew bigger day by day. Every morning she was  awakened by the rising sun, and bathed by the dew. Soft breezes  refreshed her, and twisted into plaits her luxuriant hair. The trees  sang her to sleep with their rustling lullabies, the stars watched  over her at night. The swans clothed her in their soft raiment, and  the bees fed her with their honey. The beauty of the little maiden  increased with her growth. Her brow was calm and pure as the moon, her  lips red as a rosebud, and so eloquent that her voice sounded like a  shower of pearls. But wonderful beyond compare was the expressive  beauty of her eyes, for if she looked at you kindly you seemed to  float in a sea of joy, if angrily it made you numb with fear, and you  were instantly changed into a block of ice. She was waited upon by her  twelve companions, who were almost as charming as their mistress, to  whom they were devotedly attached. Rumours of the loveliness of  Princess Sudolisu spread far and wide. People came to see her from all  parts of the world, so that it was soon no longer a desert island, but  a thickly populated and magnificent city.    [Illustration]    Many a prince came from afar and entered the lists as suitor for the  hand of Sudolisu, but none succeeded in winning her love. Those who  bore with good temper and resignation the disappointment of being  refused returned home safe and sound, but woe to the unlucky wretch  who rebelled against her will and attempted to use an armed force; his  soldiers perished miserably, while he, frozen to the heart by her  angry glance, was turned into a block of ice.    Now it happened that the famous ogre, Kostey, who lived underground,  was a great admirer of beauty. And he took it into his head to see  what the creatures above ground were doing. By the help of his  telescope he was able to observe all the kings and queens, princes and  princesses, gentlemen and ladies, living on the earth. As he was  looking his eye fell upon a beautiful island, where, bright as many  stars, stood twelve maidens; while in their midst, upon a couch of  swan's-down, slept a young princess lovely as the dawn of day.  Sudolisu was dreaming of a young knight who rode a spirited horse; on  his breast was a golden cuirass, and in his hand an invisible club.  And in her dream she admired this knight, and loved him more than life  itself. The wicked Kostey longed to have her for his own, and  determined to carry her off. He reached the earth by striking it from  underground three times with his forehead. The princess called her  army together, and putting herself at its head, led her soldiers  against him. But he merely breathed upon the soldiers and they fell  down in an overpowering sleep. Then he stretched out his bony hands to  take the princess, but she, throwing a glance full of anger and  disdain at him, changed him into a block of ice. Then she shut herself  up in her palace. Kostey did not remain frozen long; when the princess  had departed he came to life again, and started off in pursuit of her.  On reaching the town where she dwelt, he put all the inhabitants into  a charmed sleep, and laid the same spell upon the twelve maids of  honour. Fearing the power of her eyes, he dared not attack Sudolisu  herself; so he surrounded her palace with an iron wall, and left it in  charge of a monster dragon with twelve heads. Then he waited, in hope  that the princess would give in.    Days passed, weeks grew into months, and still Princess Sudolisu's  kingdom looked like one large bedchamber. The people snored in the  streets, the brave army lying in the fields slept soundly, hidden in  the long grass under the shadow of nettle, wormwood, and thistle, rust  and dust marring the brightness of their armour. Inside the palace  everything was the same. The twelve maids of honour lay motionless.  The princess alone kept watch, silent amid this reign of sleep. She  walked up and down her narrow prison, sighing and weeping bitter  tears, but no other sound broke the silence; only Kostey, avoiding her  glance, still called through the doors and begged her to refuse him no  longer. Then he promised she should be Queen of the Nether World, but  she answered him not.    Lonely and miserable, she thought of the prince of her dreams. She saw  him in his golden armour, mounted on his spirited steed, looking at  her with eyes full of love. So she imagined him day and night.    Looking out of window one day, and seeing a cloud floating on the  horizon, she cried:      \"Floating Cloudlet soft and white,      Pilgrim of the sky,    I pray you for one moment, light      On me your pitying eye.    Where my love is can you tell?    Thinks he of me ill or well?\"    \"I know not,\" answered the cloud, \"ask the wind.\"    Then she saw a tiny breeze playing among the field flowers, and called  out:      \"Gentle Breezelet, soul of air,      Look not lightly on my pain;    Kindly lift me from despair,      Help me freedom to regain.    Where my love is can you tell?    Thinks he of me ill or well?\"    \"Ask that little star yonder,\" answered the breeze, \"she knows more  than I.\"    Sudolisu raised her beautiful eyes to the twinkling stars and said:      \"Shining Star, God's light on high,      Look down and prithee see;    Behold me weep and hear me sigh,      Then help and pity me.    Where my love is canst thou tell?    Thinks he of me ill or well?\"    \"You will learn more from the moon,\" answered the star; \"she lives  nearer the earth than I, and sees everything that goes on there.\"    The moon was just rising from her silver bed when Sudolisu called to  her:      \"Pearl of the Sky, thou radiant Moon,      Thy watch o'er the stars pray leave,    Throw thy soft glance o'er the earth ere I swoon,      O'ercome by my sorrows I weep and I grieve.    I pine for my friend, oh ease thou my heart,    And say, am I loved? In his thoughts have I part?\"    \"Princess,\" replied the moon, \"I know nothing of your friend. But wait  a few hours, the sun will have then risen; he knows everything, and  will surely be able to tell you.\"    So the princess kept her eyes fixed upon that part of the sky where  the sun first appears, chasing away the darkness like a flock of  birds. When he came forth in all his glory she said:      \"Soul of the World, thou deep fountain of life,      Eye of all-powerful God,    Visit my prison, dark scene of sad strife,      Raise up my soul from the sod,    With hope that my friend whom I pine for and love    May come to my rescue. Say, where does he rove?\"    \"Sweet Sudolisu,\" answered the sun, \"dry the tears that like pearls  roll down your sad and lovely face. Let your troubled heart be at  peace, for your friend the prince is now on his way to rescue you. He  has recovered the magic ring from the Nether World, and many armies  from those countries have assembled to follow him. He is now moving  towards Kostey's palace, and intends to punish him. But all this will  be of no avail, and Kostey will gain the victory, if the prince does  not make use of other means which I am now on my way to provide him  with. Farewell; be brave, he whom you love will come to your aid and  save you from Kostey and his sorceries; happiness is in store for you  both.\"    The sun then rose upon a distant land where Prince Junak, mounted on a  powerful steed and clad in golden armour, assembled his forces to  fight against the giant Kostey. Thrice he had dreamt of the beautiful  princess shut up in the Sleeping Palace, for the fame of her  loveliness had reached him, and he loved without having seen.    \"Leave your army where it is,\" said the sun, \"it will not be of the  slightest use in fighting against Kostey, he is proof against all  weapons. The only way to rescue the princess is to kill him, and there  is but one who can tell you how to do it, and that is the witch, old  Yaga. I will show you how to find the horse that will carry you  straight to her. First take the road to the east, and walk on till you  come to a wide plain: there,"]]]
