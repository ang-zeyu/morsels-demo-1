But, fast as our libraries grow, not even their growth fully represents  the avalanche of books that is every year poured upon the reader's  devoted head by the presses of the world. To take only the four  countries in whose literature we are most interested we find their  annual book publication, for the latest normal year, 1913, to be as  follows: Germany, 35,078 volumes; France, 11,460; England, 12,379;  America, 12,230. But Japan, Russia, and Italy are each credited with  issuing more books annually than either England or the United States,  and the total annual book publication of the world is estimated to reach  the enormous figure of more than 130,000 volumes. In view of this  prodigious literary output, what progress can the reader hope to make in  \"keeping up with the new books\"? De Quincey figured that a man might  possibly, in a long lifetime devoted to nothing else, read 20,000  volumes. The estimate is easy. Suppose we start with one book a  day--surely a large supposition--and count a man's reading years from 20  to 80, 60 years in all; 60 times 365 is 21,900. This estimate makes no  allowance for Sundays, holidays, or sickness. Yet, small as it is--for  there are private libraries containing 20,000 volumes--it is manifestly  too large. But whatever the sum total may be, whether 20,000 or 2,000,  let us see, if I may use the expression, what a one must read before he  can allow himself to read what he really wants to.    First of all we must read the books that form the intellectual tools of  our trade, and there is no profession and hardly a handicraft that does  not possess its literature. For instance, there are more than ten  periodicals in the German language alone devoted exclusively to such a  narrow field as beekeeping. Such periodicals and such books we do not  call literature, any more than we do the labors of the man or woman who  supplies the text for Butterick's patterns. But they are printed matter,  and the reading of them takes up time that we might have spent upon  \"books that are books.\"    But besides this bread and butter reading there is another sort that we  must admit into our lives if we are to be citizens of the world we live  in, contemporaries of our own age, men among the men of our time, and  that is reading for general information. The time has long since gone  by, to be sure, when any man could, like Lord Bacon, take all knowledge  for his province--we can hardly take a bird's-eye view of all knowledge  to-day. No amount of reading will ever produce another Scaliger, learned  in every subject. To be well informed, even in these days of the  banyan-like growth of the tree of knowledge, is to be a miracle of  erudition. Most of mankind must be content with the modest aim which Dr.  Holmes set for the poet, to know enough not to make too many blunders.  In carrying out this humble purpose, that of merely touching elbows with  the thronging multitude of facts of interest to the civilized man, we  have a task great enough to occupy the time of any reader, even if he  made it his vocation; and with most of us it must be only a minor  avocation. The very books about the books in this boundless field, the  compends of the compends, the reviews of the reviews, form in themselves  a library great enough to stagger human weakness. Besides all this--in a  sense a part of it, yet a miscellaneous and irrational part--come the  newspapers, with their daily distraction. This is after all our world,  and we cannot live in it and be absolute nonconformists. So we must  submit to the newspaper, though it makes a heavy addition to our daily  load of reading for information. But there is still another kind of  necessary reading that I wish to mention before we come to that which  ranks chief in importance.    The woman who takes out of the public or subscription library a novel a  day is only suffering from the perversion of an appetite that in its  normal state is beneficial. It is possible that her husband does not  read enough for amusement, that his horizon is narrowed, his sympathies  stunted by the lack of that very influence which, in excess, unfits his  wife for the realities and duties of everyday existence. It came as a  surprise to many to learn from Tennyson's \"Life\" that the author of \"In  Memoriam\" was a great novel reader. But clearly in his case the novel  produced no weakening of the mental fiber. President Garfield advised  the student to mingle with his heavier reading a judicious proportion of  fiction. The novel may rank in the highest department of literature and  may render the inestimable service of broadening and quickening our  sympathies. In this case it belongs to the class of the best books. But  I have introduced it here as the most prominent representative of what  we may call the literature of recreation. There is a further  representative of this class that is peculiarly well fitted to bring  refreshment and cheer to the weary and dispirited, and that is humor,  which is often also the soundest philosophy.    If the reader does not at the outset make provision in his daily reading  for the best books, the days and the months will go by, and the unopened  volumes will look down upon him from his shelves in dumb reproof of his  neglect and reminder of his loss. In truth it is all a matter of the  balance of gain. What we rate highest we shall find room for. If we  cannot have our spiritual food and satisfy all our other wants, perhaps  we shall find that some of our other wants can do with less  satisfaction. That we should neglect the material side of life for the  spiritual I do not say. But for our encouragement let me quote another  estimate of what may be accomplished by persistent reading, and my  authority shall be the late Professor William Mathews, the essayist, an  author whose graceful style bears lightly as a flower a weight of  learning that would appall, if it did not so delight us. Says Dr.  Mathews:         Did you ever think of the sum total of knowledge that may be       accumulated in a decade, or score of years, or a lifetime by       reading only 10 pages a day? He who has read but that small       amount daily, omitting Sundays, has read in a year 3130       pages, which is equal to six volumes of 521 pages each,       enough to enable one to master a science. In five years he       will have read 15,650 pages, equivalent to 30 large volumes,       or to 60 of the average size. Now, we do not hesitate to say       that 30 volumes of 521 pages each of history, biography,       science, and literature, well chosen, well read, and well       digested, will be worth to nine persons out of ten more than       the average collegiate education is to the majority of       graduates.    Our case for knowing the best books is, therefore, not hopeless. What we  need for the achievement is not genius, but only a moderate amount of  forethought and persistence. But who is there that has not tasted the  joy of discovering a great book that seemed written for himself alone?  If there is such a man, he is to be pitied--unless, indeed, he is to be  congratulated on the unimagined pleasure in store for him. Discovery is  not too strong a word for the feeling of the reader when he lights upon  such a world-opening volume. He feels that no one else ever could have  had the same appreciation of it, ever really discovered it, that he is              the first that ever burst      Into that silent sea.    Keats, in his glorious sonnet, \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer,\"  has given the finest of all expressions to this sense of literary  discovery.        Much have I travelled in the realms of gold        And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;        Round many western islands have I been      Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.      Oft of one wide expanse had I been told        That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne:        Yet never did I breathe its pure serene      Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:      Then felt I like some watcher in the skies        When a new planet swims into his ken;      Or like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes        He stared at the Pacific--and all his men      Looked at each other with a wild surmise--        Silent, upon a peak in Darien.    To describe such accessions of spiritual vision we turn instinctively to  the narratives of Holy Writ, to Pisgah and its revelation of the  Promised Land, to the ladder at Bethel with its angels ascending and  descending, and to the lonely seer on Patmos with his vision of a new  heaven and a new earth.    But, questions a listener, do books ever really affect people like this?  Most assuredly! We have only to turn to biography for the record, if we  do not find living witnesses among our friends. It was said of Neander  that \"Plato is his idol--his constant watchword. He sits day and night  over him; and there are few who have so thoroughly and in such purity  imbibed his wisdom.\"    The elder Professor Torrey, of the University of Vermont, found his  inspiration, as many another has done, in Dante. In his youth he  preferred the Inferno; in his middle life he rose to the calm heights of  the Purgatorio; and he used to say with a smile that perhaps the time  would come when he should be fitted to appreciate the Paradiso. Highly  interesting is John Ruskin's tribute to Sir Walter Scott:         It is one of the griefs of my old age that I know Scott by       heart, but still, if I take up a volume of him, it is not       laid down again for the next hour.    Beside this we may place Goethe's testimony, also written in old age:         We read many, too many, poor things, thus losing our time       and gaining nothing. We should only read what we "]]]
