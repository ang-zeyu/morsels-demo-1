The former or more ancient[42] pueblo was situated on the first or  lowest terrace of East Mesa, below the present pueblo, on the northern  and western sides. The name Kuechaptuevela signifies \"Ash-hill terrace,\"  and probably the old settlement, like the modern, was known as Walpi,  \"Place-of-the-gap,\" referring to the gap or notch (_wala_) in the mesa  east of Hano.    Old Walpi is said to have been abandoned because it was in the shade  of the mesa, but doubtless the true cause of its removal was that the  site was too much exposed, commanded as it was by the towering mesa  above it, and easily approached on three sides. The Walpi which was  contemporary with Sikyatki was built in an exposed location, for at  that time the Hopi were comparatively secure from invaders. Later,  however, Apache, Ute, and Navaho began to raid their fields, and the  Spaniards came in their midst again and again, forcing them to work  like slaves. A more protected site was necessary, and late in the  seventeenth century the Walpians began to erect houses on the mesa,  which formed the nucleus of the present town. The standing walls of  Old Walpi are buried in the debris, but the plans of the rooms may  readily be traced. Comparatively speaking, it was a large, compact,  well-built pueblo, and, from the great piles of debris in the  neighborhood, would seem to have been occupied during several  generations.    The pottery found in the neighborhood is the fine, ancient Tusayan  ware, like that of Sikyatki and Shunopovi. Extended excavations would  reveal, I am sure, many beautiful objects and shed considerable light  on the obscure history of Walpi and its early population.    After moving from Old Walpi it seems that the people first built  houses on the terrace above, or on the platform extending westward  from the western limits of the summit of East Mesa. The whole top of  that part of the mesa is covered with house walls, showing the former  existence of a large pueblo. Here, no doubt, if we can trust  tradition, the mission of Walpi was built, and I have found in the  debris fragments of pottery similar to that used in Mexico, and very  different from ancient or modern Pueblo ware. But even Kisakobi[43]  was not a safe site for the Walpians to choose for their village, so  after they destroyed the mission and killed the priest they moved up  to their present site and abandoned both of their former villages.    It is said that with this removal of the villagers there were found to  be no easy means of climbing the precipitous walls, and that the  stairway trails were made as late as the beginning of the present  century. In those early days there was a ladder near where the  stairway trail is now situated, and some of the older men of Walpi  have pointed out to me where this ladder formerly stood.    The present plan of Walpi shows marked differences from that made  twenty years ago, and several houses between the stairway trail and  the Wikwaliobi kiva, on the edge of the mesa, which have now fallen  into ruin, were inhabited when I first visited Walpi in 1890. The  buildings between the Snake kiva and the Nacab kiva are rapidly  becoming unsafe for habitation, and most of these rooms will soon be  deserted. As many Walpi families are building new houses on the plain,  it needs no prophet to predict that the desertion of the present site  of Walpi will progress rapidly in the next few years, and possibly by  the end of our generation the pueblo may be wholly deserted--one more  ruin added to the multitudes in the Southwest.    The site of Old Walpi, at Kuechaptuevela, is the scene of an interesting  rite in the New-fire ceremony at Walpi, for not far from it is a  shrine dedicated to a supernatural being called Tuewapontumsi,  \"Earth-altar-woman.\" This shrine, or house, as it is called, is about  230 feet from the ruin, among the neighboring bowlders, and consists  of four flat slabs set upright, forming an inclosure in which stands a  log of fossil wood.    The ceremonials at Old Walpi in the New-fire rites are described in my  account[44] of this observance, and from their nature I suspect that  the essential part of this episode is the deposit of offerings at this  shrine. The circuits about the old ruin are regarded as survivals of  the rites which took place in former times at Old Walpi. The ruin was  spoken of in the ceremony as the _Sipapueni_, the abode of the dead who  had become _katcinas_, to whom the prayers said in the circuits were  addressed.      KUeKUeCHOMO    The two conical mounds on the mesa above Sikyatki are often referred  to that ancient pueblo, but from their style of architecture and from  other considerations I am led to connect them with other phratries of  Tusayan. From limited excavations made in these mounds in 1891, I was  led to believe that they were round pueblos, similar to those east of  Tusayan, and that they were temporary habitations, possibly vantage  points, occupied for defense. Plate CVI illustrates their general  appearance, while the rooms of which they are composed are shown in  figure 253. At the place where the mesa narrows between these mounds  and the pueblos to the west, a wall was built from one edge of the  mesa to the other to defend the trail on this side. This wall appears  to have had watch towers or houses at intervals, which are now in  ruins, as shown in figure 254.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. CVI    THE RUINS OF KUeKUeCHOMO]    [Illustration: FIG. 253--Kuekuechomo]    The legends concerning the ancient inhabitants of Kuekuechomo are  conflicting. The late A. M. Stephen stated that tradition ascribes  them to the Coyote and Pikya (Corn) peoples, with whom the denizens of  Sikyatki made friendship, and whom the latter induced to settle there  to protect them from the Walpians. He regarded them as the last  arrivals of the Water-house phratry, while the Coyote people came from  the north at nearly the same time. From his account it would appear  that the twin mounds, Kuekuechomo, were abandoned before the destruction  of Sikyatki. The Coyote people were, I believe, akin to the Kokop or  Firewood phratry, and as the pueblo of Sikyatki was settled by the  latter, it is highly probable that the inhabitants of the two villages  were friendly and naturally combined against the Snake pueblo of  Walpi. I believe, however, there is some doubt that any branch of the  Patki people settled in Kuekuechomo, and the size of the town as  indicated by the ruin was hardly large enough to accommodate more than  one clan. Still, as there are two Kuekuechomo ruins, there may have been  a different family in each of the two house clusters.    [Illustration: FIG. 254--Defensive wall on the East Mesa]    It has been said that in ancient times, before the twin mounds of  Kuekuechomo were erected, the people of Sikyatki were greatly harassed  by the young slingers and archers of Walpi, who would come across to  the edge of the high cliff and assail them with impunity. Anyone,  however, who contemplates the great distance from Sikyatki to the edge  of the mesa may well doubt whether it was possible for the Walpi  bowmen to inflict much harm in that way.    Moreover, if the word \"slingers\" is advisedly chosen, it introduces a  kind of warfare which is not mentioned in other Tusayan legends,  although apparently throwing stones at their enemies was practiced  among Pueblos of other stocks in early historic times.[45]    We may suppose, however, that the survivors of both Kuekuechomo and  Sikyatki sought refuge in Awatobi after the prehistoric destruction of  their pueblos, for both were peopled by clans which came from the  east, and naturally went to that village, the founders of which  migrated from the same direction.      KACHINBA    The small ruin at Kachinba, the halting place of the Kachina people,  seems to have escaped the attention of students of Tusayan archeology.  It lies about six miles from Sikyatki, about east of Walpi, and is  approached by following the trail at the foot of the same mesa upon  which Kuekuechomo is situated. The ruin is located on a small foothill  and has a few standing walls. It was evidently diminutive in size and  only temporarily inhabited. The best wall found at this ruin lies at  the base of the hill, where the spring formerly was. This spring is  now filled in, but a circular wall of masonry indicates its great size  in former times.      TUKINOBI    There are evidences that the large hill on top of East Mesa, not far  from the twin mounds, was once the site of a pueblo of considerable  size, but I have not been able to gather any definite legend about it.  Near this ruin is the \"Eagle shrine\" in which round wooden imitations  of eagle eggs are ceremonially deposited, and in the immediate  vicinity of which is another shrine near which tracks are cut in the  rock, and which were evidently considered by the Indian who pointed  them out to me as having been made by some bird.[46] It is probably  from these footprints, which are elsewhere numerous, that the two  ruins called Kuekuechomo (\"footprints mound\") takes its name.      JEDITOH VALLEY RUINS    As one enters Antelope valley, following the Holbrook road, he finds  himself in what was formerly a densely populated region of Tusayan.  This valley in former times was regarded as a garden spot, and the  plain was covered with patches of corn, beans, squashes, and chile.  The former inhabitants lived in pueblos on the northern side, high up  on the mesa which separates Jeditoh valley from Keam's canyon. All of  these pueblos are now in ruins, and only a few Navaho and Hopi  families cultivate small tracts in the once productive fields.

These all clamoured for their independence. They had gone  as far as to assert it by stopping posts, carts, and persons, and  sending armed patrols about the country.    Nothing definite resulted from this attitude, however, for before  very long the conclusion--the successful conclusion--of the Zulu war  appeared imminent, and those in revolt against British authority saw  plainly that there would shortly be troops in plenty at hand to  restore law and order. Consequently for the time being they  subsided. The loyal inhabitants of the Transvaal entertained Sir  Bartle Frere prior to his departure, and at the public dinner given  on that occasion at Potchefstrom, he took the opportunity to assure  them that the Transvaal would never be given back! It may be  interesting to some to know, that at a public meeting on the 24th  of April in Pretoria, within a week of the breaking up of the camp  which had been threatening its safety, the following resolution was  passed:--    \"This meeting reprobates most strongly the action of a certain  section of the English and Colonial press for censuring, without  sufficient knowledge of local affairs, the policy and conduct of Sir  Bartle Frere, and it desires not only to express its sympathy with  Sir Bartle Frere, and its confidence in his policy, but also to go  so far as to congratulate most heartily her Majesty the Queen, the  Home Government, and ourselves, on possessing such a true,  considerate, and faithful servant as his Excellency the High  Commissioner.\"    Having made allusion to Sir Bartle Frere's departure, it may be as  well to explain that before the battle of Ulundi it was arranged  that Sir Garnet Wolseley should be sent out from home to supersede  Lord Chelmsford in the command of the army, Sir H. Bulwer as  Governor of Natal, and Sir Bartle Frere as High Commissioner of the  Transvaal, Natal, and all the eastern portion of South Africa. Sir  Garnet reached Cape Town on the 28th of June, and proceeded without  delay to Natal. But, as we know, before he could reach the seat of  war the battle of Ulundi was won.    The fighting was now at an end; the Zulus expressed themselves  beaten, and Cetchwayo, after an exciting chase, which space does not  permit us to describe, was taken prisoner on the 28th of August. He  was afterwards removed to Cape Town, and rooms were given him in the  castle. Hostilities having happily terminated in Zululand, Sir  Garnet Wolseley then started for Pretoria. He there finally set up  the government of a Crown Colony with a nominative Executive Council  and Legislative Assembly.    One of his first acts on reaching Pretoria was to issue a notable  proclamation. It ran thus:----    \"Whereas it appears, that notwithstanding repeated assurances of  contrary effect given by her Majesty's representatives in this  territory, uncertainty or misapprehension exists among some of her  Majesty's subjects as to the intention of her Majesty's Government  regarding the maintenance of British rule and sovereignty over the  territory of the Transvaal: and whereas it is expedient that all  grounds for such uncertainty or misapprehension should be removed  once and for all beyond doubt or question: now therefore I do hereby  proclaim and make known, in the name and on behalf of her Majesty  the Queen, that it is the will and determination of her Majesty's  Government that this Transvaal territory shall be, and shall  continue to be for ever, an integral portion of her Majesty's  dominions in South Africa.\"    On the same subject Sir Bartle Frere, writing to England, said that  he was very certain \"that to give up the Transvaal is as little to  be thought of as surrendering Ireland or India.\" In his opinion the  Boer malcontents were few and inconsequential, most of the leaders  and instigators being foreigners, who were personally interested in  making themselves prominent, owing to the prevailing notion that the  country would be given up. As to the effect of the abandonment of  the Transvaal on the prospects of confederation he said: \"To every  colony concerned such a step would appear as a confession of  weakness, of infirmity of purpose, and of disregard for solemn  pledges and obligations, which would destroy all respect, all wish  to belong to a Government which could so behave.\"    In writing to Sir M. Hicks Beach, in December 1879, Sir Bartle gave  his personal impression of the feeling in Pretoria at the time of  the annexation:--         \"When our power of enforcing the law and upholding the authority of       Government were at the lowest, in April last, ... experienced men       at Pretoria gave me, through Colonel Lanyon, the following estimate       of the strength of parties in the malcontent camp. The educated and       intelligent men of influence, who advocated the most extreme       measures, or were prepared to acquiesce in them, were reckoned at       not more than eight. Three, or perhaps four, were men of property       in the Transvaal; the rest foreign adventurers, with no property       and little weight beyond that due to their skill as political       agitators. Their unflinching and uncompromising followers in the       Boer camp were not reckoned at more than eighty. The disaffected       waverers who, according to circumstances, would follow the majority       either to acts of overt resistance to Government and lawless       violence, or to grumble and disperse, 'accepting the inevitable,'       were reckoned at about eight hundred at the outside. The rest of       the camp, variously estimated as containing from sixteen hundred to       four thousand in all, but probably never exceeding two thousand       five hundred present at one time, were men brought to the camp by       intimidation, compulsion, or curiosity, who would not willingly       resist the authority of Government, and would, if assured of       protection, prefer to side with it.\"    Viewed in the light of later events, these opinions are extremely  interesting and cannot be disregarded.    [Illustration: OFFICER of the 16th LANCERS.    Photo by Gregory and Co., London.]    Before passing on, it is necessary to state that during the period  from 1878 to 1879, the native chief Sekukuni--Cetchwayo's dog, as  the blacks called him--had become obstreperous. He had been engaged  in raids into the Transvaal--raids of the same character as those  which, as has been already mentioned, had helped to bring about the  collapse of the Republic. Colonel Rowland's expedition, which  started in November 1878 for the suppression of this ruffian, was  baffled by fever and horse sickness. Colonel Lanyon in the following  June returned to the attack, and was on the eve of success, when Sir  Garnet Wolseley (who arrived late in that month) sent orders to  cease operations. These orders he found, on reaching the  Transvaal, to be a mistake. Sekukuni was not a person to be trifled  with nor ignored, so the campaign began again in November, with the  result that within a period of eight days the chief's stronghold was  taken and himself made prisoner. About fifty Europeans and some five  hundred Swazi allies were killed or wounded.    Here we see, within one year, how much was done for the protection  of the Transvaal at the cost of British money and British blood.  Looking back, it is easy to perceive that, but for our intervention,  the South African Republic would have been slowly but effectually  swallowed up. Cetchwayo and Sekukuni between them would have made a  meal of the Transvaal.    The brilliant and complete success of Sir Garnet Wolseley was highly  praised, and the names of Colonel Lanyon, Captain Clark, R.A., and  Captain Carrington especially mentioned as deserving a share of the  credit for the accurate information they had collected during the  previous months.    So much having been done for the security of the Boers and for the  maintenance of British prestige, it is no marvel that Sir Garnet  Wolseley thought himself justified in expressing the trend of  British policy in plain terms. At the dinner given at Pretoria on  the 17th of December 1879 he took the opportunity of making the  British programme well understood. He declared with emphasis that  there could be no question of resigning the sovereignty of the  country. \"There is no Government,\" he said, \"Whig or Tory, Liberal,  Conservative, or Radical, who would dare under any circumstances to  give back this country. They would not dare, because the English  people would not allow them!\" At that time it was evident that Sir  Garnet had never heard the story of the philanthropic Belarmine, an  individual who gave himself to the she-bear to save her and her  young ones from starvation. Or, if the tale was known to him, he  probably took it for what it was worth, and never foresaw that the  British Government would emulate the action of the self-sacrificing  lunatic, and spend precious blood for the sole purpose of nourishing  and resuscitating the powers of a languishing enemy.      MR. GLADSTONE OUT OF OFFICE AND IN OFFICE    But British speeches and proclamations had ceased to impress the  Boers. They had had too many of them, and they began to think the  British Government a somewhat knock-kneed institution whose joints  had ceased to hold together. Sir Garnet Wolseley, however, with  characteristic energy and determination, dealt with the malcontents  one by one, converting them, and causing them to sensibly consider  on which side their bread was buttered. Indeed, so diplomatically  did he conduct his work, that a sop was given to the aggressive  Pretorius, who, instead of being put in prison as he deserved, was  offered a seat on the Executive Council, with a salary attached.  This he was inclined to jump at, but, at the time, public feeling  ran too high to allow of his making a decision. The fact was that  the"]]]
