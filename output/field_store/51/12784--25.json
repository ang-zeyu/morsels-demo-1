They contain numerous chloroplasts imbedded in the layer    of protoplasm that lines the wall. The nucleus (Fig. 63, _C_, _n_)    may usually be seen without difficulty, especially if the leaf is    treated with iodine. This plant is one of the best for studying the    division of the chloroplasts, which may usually be found in all    stages of division (Fig. 63, _D_). In the chloroplasts, especially    if the plant has been exposed to light for several hours, will be    found numerous small granules, that assume a bluish tint on the    application of iodine, showing them to be starch grains. If the    plant is kept in the dark for a day or two, these will be absent,    having been used up; but if exposed to the light again, new ones    will be formed, showing that they are formed only under the action    of light.    [Illustration: FIG. 60.--_A_, _B_, young antheridia of _Funaria_,  optical section, x 150. _C_, two sperm cells of _Atrichum_. _D_,  spermatozoids of _Sphagnum_, x 600.]      Starch is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and so far as is    known is only produced by chlorophyll-bearing cells, under the    influence of light. The carbon used in the manufacture of starch is    taken from the atmosphere in the form of carbonic acid, so that    green plants serve to purify the atmosphere by the removal of this    substance, which is deleterious to animal life, while at the same    time the carbon, an essential part of all living matter, is combined    in such form as to make it available for the food of other    organisms.      The marginal cells of the leaf are narrow, and some of them    prolonged into teeth.      A cross-section of the stem (63, _E_) shows on the outside a single    row of epidermal cells, then larger chlorophyll-bearing cells, and    in the centre a group of very delicate, small, colorless cells,    which in longitudinal section are seen to be elongated, and similar    to those forming the midrib of the leaf. These cells probably serve    for conducting fluids, much as the similar but more perfectly    developed bundles of cells (fibro-vascular bundles) found in the    stems and leaves of the higher plants.      The root hairs, fastening the plant to the ground, are rows of    cells with brown walls and oblique partitions. They often merge    insensibly into the green filaments (protonema) already noticed.    These latter have usually colorless walls, and more numerous    chloroplasts, looking very much like a delicate specimen of    _Cladophora_ or some similar alga. If a sufficient number of these    filaments is examined, some of them will probably show young moss    plants growing from them (Fig. 63, _A_, _k_), and with a little    patience the leafy plant can be traced back to a little bud    originating as a branch of the filament. Its diameter is at first    scarcely greater than that of the filament, but a series of walls,    close together, are formed, so placed as to cut off a pyramidal cell    at the top, forming the apical cell of the young moss plant. This    apical cell has the form of a three-sided pyramid with the base    upward. From it are developed three series of cells, cut off in    succession from the three sides, and from these cells are derived    all the tissues of the plant which soon becomes of sufficient size    to be easily recognizable.      The protonemal filaments may be made to grow from almost any part of    the plant by keeping it moist, but grow most abundantly from the    base of the stem.      The sexual organs are much like those of the liverworts and are    borne at the apex of the stems.      The antheridia (Figs. 59, 60) are club-shaped bodies with a short    stalk. The upper part consists of a single layer of large    chlorophyll-bearing cells, enclosing a mass of very small, nearly    cubical, colorless, sperm cells each of which contains an    excessively small spermatozoid.      The young antheridium has an apical cell giving rise to two series    of segments (Fig. 60, _A_), which in the earlier stages are very    plainly marked.      When ripe the chlorophyll in the outer cells changes color, becoming    red, and if a few such antheridia from a plant that has been kept    rather dry for a day or two, are teased out in a drop of water, they    will quickly open at the apex, the whole mass of sperm cells being    discharged at once.      Among the antheridia are borne peculiar hairs (Fig. 59, _p_) tipped    by a large globular cell.    [Illustration: FIG. 61.--_A_, _B_, young; _C_, nearly ripe archegonium  of _Funaria_, optical section, x 150. _D_, upper part of the neck of  _C_, seen from without, showing how it is twisted. _E_, base of a ripe  archegonium. _F_, open apex of the same, x 150. _o_, egg cell. _b_,  ventral canal cell.]      Owing to their small size the spermatozoids are difficult to see    satisfactorily and other mosses (_e.g._ peat mosses, Figure 64, the    hairy cap moss, Figure 65, _I_), are preferable where obtainable.    The spermatozoids of a peat moss are shown in Figure 60, _D_. Like    all of the bryophytes they have but two cilia.      The archegonia (Fig. 61) should be looked for in the younger plants    in the neighborhood of those that bear capsules. Like the antheridia    they occur in groups. They closely resemble those of the liverworts,    but the neck is longer and twisted and the base more massive.    Usually but a single one of the group is fertilized.    [Illustration: FIG. 62.--_A_, young embryo of _Funaria_, still  enclosed within the base of the archegonium, x 300. _B_, an older  embryo freed from the archegonium, x 150. _a_, the apical cell.]      To study the first division of the embryo, it is usually necessary    to render the archegonium transparent, which may be done by using a    little caustic potash; or letting it lie for a few hours in dilute    glycerine will sometimes suffice. If potash is used it must be    thoroughly washed away, by drawing pure water under the cover glass    with a bit of blotting paper, until every trace of the potash is    removed. The first wall in the embryo is nearly at right angles to    the axis of the archegonium and divides the egg cell into nearly    equal parts. This is followed by nearly vertical walls in each cell    (Fig. 62, _A_). Very soon a two-sided apical cell (Fig. 62, _B_,    _a_) is formed in the upper half of the embryo, which persists until    the embryo has reached a considerable size. As in the liverworts the    young embryo is completely covered by the growing archegonium wall.      The embryo may be readily removed from the archegonium by adding a    little potash to the water in which it is lying, allowing it to    remain for a few moments and pressing gently upon the cover glass    with a needle. In this way it can be easily forced out of the    archegonium, and then by thoroughly washing away the potash,    neutralizing if necessary with a little acetic acid, very beautiful    preparations may be made. If desired, these may be mounted    permanently in glycerine which, however, must be added very    gradually to avoid shrinking the cells.    [Illustration: FIG. 63.--_A_, protonema of _Funaria_, with a bud  (_k_), x 50. _B_, outline of a leaf, showing also the thickened  midrib, x 12. _C_, cells of the leaf, x 300. _n_, nucleus. _D_,  chlorophyll granules undergoing division, x 300. _E_, cross-section of  the stem, x 50.]      For some time the embryo has a nearly cylindrical form, but as it    approaches maturity the differentiation into stalk and capsule    becomes apparent. The latter increases rapidly in diameter, assuming    gradually the oval shape of the full-grown capsule. A longitudinal    section of the nearly ripe capsule (Fig. 58, _G_) shows two distinct    portions; an outer wall of two layers of cells, and an inner mass of    cells in some of which the spores are produced. This inner mass of    cells is continuous with the upper part of the capsule, but    connected with the side walls and bottom by means of slender,    branching filaments of chlorophyll-bearing cells.      The spores arise from a single layer of cells near the outside of    the inner mass of cells (_G_, _sp._). These cells (_H_, _sp._) are    filled with glistening, granular protoplasm; have a large and    distinct nucleus, and no chlorophyll. They finally become entirely    separated and each one gives rise to four spores which closely    resemble those of the liverworts but are smaller.      Near the base of the capsule, on the outside, are formed breathing    pores (Fig. 58, _F_) quite similar to those of the higher plants.      If the spores are kept in water for a few days they will germinate,    bursting the outer brown coat, and the contents protruding through    the opening surrounded by the colorless inner spore membrane. The    protuberance grows rapidly in length and soon becomes separated from    the body of the spore by a wall, and lengthening, more and more,    gives rise to a green filament like those we found attached to the    base of the full-grown plant, and like those giving rise to buds    that develop into leafy plants.      CLASSIFICATION OF THE MOSSES.    The mosses may be divided into four orders: I. The peat mosses  (_Sphagnaceae_); II. _Andreaeaceae_; III. _Phascaceae_; IV. The common  mosses (_Bryaceae_).    [Illustration: FIG. 64.--_A_, a peat moss (_Sphagnum_), x 1/2. _B_, a  sporogonium of the same, x 3. _C_, a portion of a leaf, x 150. The  narrow, chlorophyll-bearing cells form meshes, enclosing the large,  colorless empty cells, whose walls are marked with thickened bars, and  contain round openings (_o_).]    The peat mosses (Fig. 64) are large pale-green mosses, growing often  in enormous masses, forming the foundation of peat-bogs. They are of a  peculiar spongy texture, very light when dry, and capable of absorbing  a great amount of water.

Perhaps this cause, and a slight incident which I omit, might have been  the immediate occasions of the following dream, to which, however, a  predisposition must always have existed in my mind; but having been once  roused it never left me, and split into a thousand fantastic varieties,  which often suddenly reunited, and composed again the original dream.    I thought that it was a Sunday morning in May, that it was Easter Sunday,  and as yet very early in the morning.  I was standing, as it seemed to  me, at the door of my own cottage.  Right before me lay the very scene  which could really be commanded from that situation, but exalted, as was  usual, and solemnised by the power of dreams.  There were the same  mountains, and the same lovely valley at their feet; but the mountains  were raised to more than Alpine height, and there was interspace far  larger between them of meadows and forest lawns; the hedges were rich  with white roses; and no living creature was to be seen, excepting that  in the green churchyard there were cattle tranquilly reposing upon the  verdant graves, and particularly round about the grave of a child whom I  had tenderly loved, just as I had really beheld them, a little before  sunrise in the same summer, when that child died.  I gazed upon the well-  known scene, and I said aloud (as I thought) to myself, \"It yet wants  much of sunrise, and it is Easter Sunday; and that is the day on which  they celebrate the first fruits of resurrection.  I will walk abroad; old  griefs shall be forgotten to-day; for the air is cool and still, and the  hills are high and stretch away to heaven; and the forest glades are as  quiet as the churchyard, and with the dew I can wash the fever from my  forehead, and then I shall be unhappy no longer.\"  And I turned as if to  open my garden gate, and immediately I saw upon the left a scene far  different, but which yet the power of dreams had reconciled into harmony  with the other.  The scene was an Oriental one, and there also it was  Easter Sunday, and very early in the morning.  And at a vast distance  were visible, as a stain upon the horizon, the domes and cupolas of a  great city--an image or faint abstraction, caught perhaps in childhood  from some picture of Jerusalem.  And not a bow-shot from me, upon a stone  and shaded by Judean palms, there sat a woman, and I looked, and it  was--Ann!  She fixed her eyes upon me earnestly, and I said to her at  length: \"So, then, I have found you at last.\"  I waited, but she answered  me not a word.  Her face was the same as when I saw it last, and yet  again how different!  Seventeen years ago, when the lamplight fell upon  her face, as for the last time I kissed her lips (lips, Ann, that to me  were not polluted), her eyes were streaming with tears: the tears were  now wiped away; she seemed more beautiful than she was at that time, but  in all other points the same, and not older.  Her looks were tranquil,  but with unusual solemnity of expression, and I now gazed upon her with  some awe; but suddenly her countenance grew dim, and turning to the  mountains I perceived vapours rolling between us.  In a moment all had  vanished, thick darkness came on, and in the twinkling of an eye I was  far away from mountains, and by lamplight in Oxford Street, walking again  with Ann--just as we walked seventeen years before, when we were both  children.    As a final specimen, I cite one of a different character, from 1820.    The dream commenced with a music which now I often heard in dreams--a  music of preparation and of awakening suspense, a music like the opening  of the Coronation Anthem, and which, like _that_, gave the feeling of a  vast march, of infinite cavalcades filing off, and the tread of  innumerable armies.  The morning was come of a mighty day--a day of  crisis and of final hope for human nature, then suffering some mysterious  eclipse, and labouring in some dread extremity.  Somewhere, I knew not  where--somehow, I knew not how--by some beings, I knew not whom--a  battle, a strife, an agony, was conducting, was evolving like a great  drama or piece of music, with which my sympathy was the more  insupportable from my confusion as to its place, its cause, its nature,  and its possible issue.  I, as is usual in dreams (where of necessity we  make ourselves central to every movement), had the power, and yet had not  the power, to decide it.  I had the power, if I could raise myself to  will it, and yet again had not the power, for the weight of twenty  Atlantics was upon me, or the oppression of inexpiable guilt.  \"Deeper  than ever plummet sounded,\" I lay inactive.  Then like a chorus the  passion deepened.  Some greater interest was at stake, some mightier  cause than ever yet the sword had pleaded, or trumpet had proclaimed.  Then came sudden alarms, hurryings to and fro, trepidations of  innumerable fugitives--I knew not whether from the good cause or the bad,  darkness and lights, tempest and human faces, and at last, with the sense  that all was lost, female forms, and the features that were worth all the  world to me, and but a moment allowed--and clasped hands, and  heart-breaking partings, and then--everlasting farewells!  And with a  sigh, such as the caves of Hell sighed when the incestuous mother uttered  the abhorred name of death, the sound was reverberated--everlasting  farewells!  And again and yet again reverberated--everlasting farewells!    And I awoke in struggles, and cried aloud--\"I will sleep no more.\"    But I am now called upon to wind up a narrative which has already  extended to an unreasonable length.  Within more spacious limits the  materials which I have used might have been better unfolded, and much  which I have not used might have been added with effect.  Perhaps,  however, enough has been given.  It now remains that I should say  something of the way in which this conflict of horrors was finally  brought to a crisis.  The reader is already aware (from a passage near  the beginning of the introduction to the first part) that the Opium-eater  has, in some way or other, \"unwound almost to its final links the  accursed chain which bound him.\"  By what means?  To have narrated this  according to the original intention would have far exceeded the space  which can now be allowed.  It is fortunate, as such a cogent reason  exists for abridging it, that I should, on a maturer view of the case,  have been exceedingly unwilling to injure, by any such unaffecting  details, the impression of the history itself, as an appeal to the  prudence and the conscience of the yet unconfirmed opium-eater--or even  (though a very inferior consideration) to injure its effect as a  composition.  The interest of the judicious reader will not attach itself  chiefly to the subject of the fascinating spells, but to the fascinating  power.  Not the Opium-eater, but the opium, is the true hero of the tale,  and the legitimate centre on which the interest revolves.  The object was  to display the marvellous agency of opium, whether for pleasure or for  pain: if that is done, the action of the piece has closed.    However, as some people, in spite of all laws to the contrary, will  persist in asking what became of the Opium-eater, and in what state he  now is, I answer for him thus: The reader is aware that opium had long  ceased to found its empire on spells of pleasure; it was solely by the  tortures connected with the attempt to abjure it that it kept its hold.  Yet, as other tortures, no less it may be thought, attended the  non-abjuration of such a tyrant, a choice only of evils was left; and  _that_ might as well have been adopted which, however terrific in itself,  held out a prospect of final restoration to happiness.  This appears  true; but good logic gave the author no strength to act upon it.  However,  a crisis arrived for the author's life, and a crisis for other objects  still dearer to him--and which will always be far dearer to him than his  life, even now that it is again a happy one.  I saw that I must die if I  continued the opium.  I determined, therefore, if that should be  required, to die in throwing it off.  How much I was at that time taking  I cannot say, for the opium which I used had been purchased for me by a  friend, who afterwards refused to let me pay him; so that I could not  ascertain even what quantity I had used within the year.  I apprehend,  however, that I took it very irregularly, and that I varied from about  fifty or sixty grains to 150 a day.  My first task was to reduce it to  forty, to thirty, and as fast as I could to twelve grains.    I triumphed.  But think not, reader, that therefore my sufferings were  ended, nor think of me as of one sitting in a _dejected_ state.  Think of  me as one, even when four months had passed, still agitated, writhing,  throbbing, palpitating, shattered, and much perhaps in the situation of  him who has been racked, as I collect the torments of that state from the  affecting account of them left by a most innocent sufferer {20} of the  times of James I.  Meantime, I derived no benefit from any medicine,  except one prescribed to me by an Edinburgh surgeon of great eminence,  viz., ammoniated tincture of valerian.  Medical account, therefore, of my  emancipation I have not much to give, and even that little, as managed by  a man so ignorant of medicine as myself, would probably tend only to  mislead.  At all events, it would be misplaced in this situation.  The  moral of the narrative is addressed to the opium-eater, and therefore of  necessity limited in its application.  If he is taught to fear and  tremble, enough has been effected.  But he may say that the issue of my  case is at least a proof that opium, after a seventeen years' use and an  eight years' abuse of its powers, may still be renounced, and that _he_  may chance"]]]
