I have shown elsewhere that  by 1312 this order had become as much the bankers of Europe as were  the Jews of a century before, and that the charges of witchcraft had  merely been trumped up by royal debtors who preferred hanging their  creditors to paying their bills. The sign of the Barde or Barge  Royale, now in the Musee des Antiquites is the only remnant of the  Templars left in Rouen. A \"Commanderie\" that lasted far longer in the  town was that of St. Antoine, which was established in 1095 to care  for those suffering from the horrible disease known as St. Anthony's  Fire. It continued its good work until 1790. Another foundation that  had its origin in the same charitable instincts was the Hospital of  the Mont-aux-Malades, founded to care for cases of the terrible  leprosy brought back by the Crusaders from the East. This was first  instituted by the citizens themselves in 1131, and a few years  afterwards was placed under the care of a priory of Augustinian monks.  The Church of St. Gilles was then founded on the same spot, and the  hospital's funds were increased by Guillaume Baril of St. Maclou. In  1162, Henry II. of England still further added to the revenues of the  priory and hospital by giving it the rent and privileges of the Foire  de St. Gilles with half of the octroi duty. It was to be held for a  week on the first of September every year, and fourteen years  afterwards the same king rebuilt the hospital entirely and placed the  new church under the patronage of St. Thomas of Canterbury.    This church is one of the few buildings of the time before Philip  Augustus that you may still see. To reach it you go up the Rue  Cauchoise, along the Rue St. Gervais, past the Abbey of St. Gervais,  where the Conqueror died, and where the old crypt of St. Mellon still  exists, then up a long and steep hill, on whose very summit is a  village street with a broad iron railing that opens to your right into  a pretty avenue of limes, with the worn steps of an old stone cross or  fountain to the left of the church inside. At first you will be  shocked and disappointed by the hideous modern restoration of the west  front, with its side aisles, that are but poor specimens of pointed  architecture. But go boldly inside and you will see the church of  good, plain Norman work, dedicated by King Henry to the memory of the  murdered English archbishop, and built by his chamberlain, Roscelin.  The original building had the simple nave with its apse beyond, that  we shall see on the other side of the town of St. Julien. There is a  further disappointment in store when you find the incongruous windows  inserted in the chancel and the aisles that were added later on to the  original nave. To understand what has happened you must go to the  outside of the east end, and there you will see how the old round  Norman apse was cut off, and a squared end was stuck on instead with a  large pointed window, and how a new outside roof was clumsily fitted  on to cover both the aisles and the nave as well, a job so badly  calculated that the tops of the eastern aisle-windows on both sides  show above the line of roof, and the openings themselves are blocked.  When I saw it in 1897 the church was in process of being joined on to  the religious buildings which surround it, and the closed eastern  openings had been altered, in the north aisle to a round-headed  recess, and in the south aisle to the altar of a chapel. But the five  round-headed Norman arches of the nave remain, with the four smaller  ones in the choir. Above the nave arches are five narrow round-arched  windows which do not correspond with the pillars beneath, but are  merely holes in a thick wall instead of spaces between vaulting-shafts,  as they are in the perfect Gothic of St. Ouen. But even so these  windows are far better than the incongruous pointed work in the newer  aisles. There is no transept, and the roof is a plain vault. The round  columns, too, are quite plain, with slight carving here and there upon  the capitals. And this is all that is left of the church which Henry  II. ordered to be built in 1176.    Twenty-one parishes used to send their lepers to this hospital, and  those who could not pay their fees were helped to do so from the  parish purse. In 1478 each leper was obliged to bring with him (among  other things), a bed with its sheets, all his body-linen and towels,  his cooking pots and table ware, and various articles of clothing,  besides 62 sous 1 denier for the prior, 5 sous for the servants,[21]  and three \"hanaps\" or drinking vessels, one of silver. Evidently all  this was not what a poor patient could often afford, and we find,  without surprise, the parish St. John objecting to the rule in case of  one Perrecte Deshays, who had been sent there by order of the  officials, and could not possibly afford the list of necessaries  claimed by the prior. So a compromise was made that for all lepers in  the twenty-one parishes who could not give what the rules required, a  sum of twenty livres from the parish authorities would be accepted as  an equivalent. The treasurers of every parish were bound, in the  public safety, to report to the proper town official every case of  leprosy within their bounds. This official then took medical advice  about the sick person, and if the leprosy was certified ordered the  sequestration of the invalid. The acts in which these orders were  carried out continue very frequent, even in the first half of the  sixteenth century, and especially in the parish of Octeville. The  leper was conducted to the hospital with exactly the same ceremony as  was used for the interment of the dead, and was followed by all the  members of the confrerie to which he belonged, and preceded by a  mourner ringing a dirge. One of the statutes of a confrerie ordaining  this procession has been preserved (Arch. de la Seine Inferieure, G.  5,238):--\"Le seroient tenus convoier jusques a sa malladerie le  maistre et varlets portans leurs sourplis et capperons vestus a toult  la croix et banniere et clochette, et sy luy feroit l'en semblable  service comme a ung trespasse en l'eglise ou il seroit demourant en  lad. ville et sy seroit led. varlet tenu crier par les carfours comme  pour ung trespasse.\"    [Footnote 21: The complete list has been printed from the archives of  Rouen by M. Ch. de Beaurepaire.]    Another of these charitable refuges for lepers was built for Rouen by  an English king in 1183 at Petit-Quevilly, outside the town on the  south side of the Seine. The Hospital of St. Julien was placed by King  Henry II. under the protection of the older Priory of Grammont, which  is now a powder magazine. It was called the \"Salle aux Pucelles,\" or  \"Nobles Lepreuses,\" because its patients were at first limited to  royal or nobles families. In 1366 the \"Maladrerie\" appears to have  outlived its original objects, and was changed into a priory, which  retained the old chapel, and seems to have kept up a public hospital  of wider scope under the patronage of Charles V. of France. It was  then known as the Prieure St. Julien. Later on it got the name of  \"Chartreux,\" which still remains, because the besieging army of Henri  Quatre wrecked the abbey on St. Catherine's hill, above the town, and  the monks came to Quevilly, where the Carthusians had already settled  themselves when the English turned them out of the Chartreuse de la  Rose, which was the headquarters of our Henry the Fifth during his  siege of Rouen early in the fifteenth century. Something of all this  changing history is perceived in the names that the traveller sees on  his way to the little church to-day. For he can either go there from  the Pont Boieldieu in an electric car marked \"Place Chartreux,\" or he  may tell his coachman to drive him to the \"Chapelle St. Julien, Rue de  l'Hospice, Petit-Quevilly.\" Unless he enjoys hunting on foot for two  small gabled roofs and a round apse, hidden away in the corner of some  ancient and twisting streets among deserted fields, driving there will  be far more satisfactory, and the visit is well worth his while.    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE CHAPEL OF ST. JULIEN, PETIT-QUEVILLY]    The little building, whose very isolation has perhaps helped to  preserve it, is now very justly classed among the best of the  \"Monuments Historiques de France\" in Normandy. There is no tower. On  the line beneath the roof round apse and nave, the corbels are carved  with the heads of hairy Franks and Saxons, according to the tradition  of the older Norman architecture at the Church of St. Paul's, which we  shall next visit, near the river.

Through the triple portal of the west entrance, with plain  round arches set on slightly carved Norman capitals, you pass at once  into the nave. The whole effect is that which can be only given by  simple, honest, and good workmanship. The restoration was carried out  with a reverential conscientiousness that is far too rare, by M.  Guillaume Lecointe, and by him this precious relic of twelfth-century  architecture and art was given to the Commune of Petit-Quevilly. A  small arcade of engaged colonnettes goes right round the whole church;  the larger pillars have carved capitals, and there is the usual  conventional Norman moulding on the round arches.    In the apse are four round-headed windows, all slightly smaller than  the four in the choir and the six in the nave. In the chancel-arch  there are two clustered columns, and also in the nave and apse. The  others have plain round shafts.
