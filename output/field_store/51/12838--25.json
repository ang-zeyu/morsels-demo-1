During the siege and capture, forty thousand men  fell. Only twelve hundred women and children were spared. So  complete was the surprise, and so unresistingly did the Jews submit  to slaughter, that only one Roman was killed.    This was Antoninus, a centurion. He came upon a Jew in a deep  cavern, and told him he would spare his life, if he would  surrender. The Jew asked him to give him his hand, as a pledge of  his faith, and to help him out of the cave. Antoninus did so, and  the Jew at once ran him through with a spear.    John was asleep when the Romans entered. He was aroused by Jonas  rushing into the room. The boy was at all times restless, and  suffered less than most of those within the walls; for there was an  abundance of grain up to the end of the siege and, until the Romans  had discovered the way down to the water, he had not suffered in  any way from thirst. He was considered too young to take part in  the actual fighting; but had labored with the rest in repairing the  defenses, carrying food to men on the walls, and carrying away the  dead and wounded.    \"Get up, John!\" he exclaimed. \"In the mist I have just run upon a  mass of Roman soldiers, ranged in order. The town is taken. Quick,  before they scatter and begin to slay!\"    John caught up his sword, and ran out. Just as he did so, a  terrible shout was heard, followed by shrieks and cries. The work  of butchery had begun.    John's plans had been laid for some time. At night Jonas had  frequently descended to the ledge, taking with him food, and jars  of the water he brought up from below; and once or twice John had  descended, Jonas fastening a rope round his body, and lowering it  gradually for, active as he was, John could not get down without  such assistance. Indeed, to any one who looked casually over the  top, the descent appeared absolutely impossible.    At the top of their speed, the lads ran to the spot at which the  descent had to be made. The rope was hidden close at hand. John  slipped the noose at the end over his shoulders. Jonas twisted the  rope once round a stunted tree, which grew close by, and allowed it  to go out gradually. As soon as the strain upon it ceased, and he  knew John was upon the ledge, he loosened the rope and dropped the  end over; and then began, himself, to descend, his bare feet and  hands clinging to every inequality, however slight, in the rock.    He presently stood by the side of John. The latter had coiled up  the rope, and laid it by him; and had then thrown himself down, and  was sobbing bitterly. Jonas sat down quietly beside him, till he  had recovered his composure.    \"It is no use fretting,\" he said, philosophically. \"There's no one  you care about, particularly, up there; and I am sure there's no  one I care about--only I should like to have peeped in, and have  seen her face, when the Romans burst open the door. I don't suppose  she was very sorry, though, for it will be better to be a Roman  slave than to be going through what they have been, for the last  month.\"    \"It is horrible!\" John said, \"Horrible! However, Jonas, let us  thank God for having thus preserved our lives, when all besides are  in such terrible danger of death.\"    For a time, the two lads sat silent. John was the first to speak.    \"I am thankful,\" he said, \"that, owing to our being down the face  of the rock, the sound is carried away above our heads, and we can  hear but little of what is going on there. It seems a confusion of  sounds, and comes to us rather as an echo from the hills, yonder,  than directly from above.\"    Sometimes, indeed, thrilling screams and shouts were heard but, for  the most part, the sounds were so blended together that they could  not be distinguished one from another. As soon as the mist cleared  off, the lads lay down, as far back from the ledge as they could  get.    \"We must not lift up a head, today,\" John said. \"The guards below,  and on the hills, will have their eyes fixed on the rock, on the  lookout for fugitives and, until nighttime, we must not venture to  sit up. Fortunately, that outer edge of the shelf is a good deal  higher than it is, back here; and I don't think that even those on  the mountain, opposite, could see us as we lie.\"    \"I should think a good many may escape, like us,\" Jonas said,  presently. \"There are numbers of caverns and passages, from which  they have dug the stone for the building of the houses. A lot of  the people are sure to hide away, there.\"    \"I daresay they will,\" John agreed; \"but I fear the Romans will  hunt them all out.\"    \"How long do you think we shall have to stay here, John?\"    \"Till the Romans go, whether it is one week or two; but I do not  think they will stay here many days. The town is so full of dead  that, in this hot weather, it will be unbearable before long. At  any rate, we shall be able to pass a good deal of time in sleep. We  have not had much of it, lately. Till last night, I have not been  in the house, at night, for over a fortnight. But I felt, last  night, as if I must have a sleep, whatever came of it. I suppose  the guards at the breach must have felt the same, or the Romans  could never have got in without the alarm being given.\"    For a few minutes, John lay thinking of the terrible scenes that  must be passing, on the rock above; then his drowsiness overcame  him, and he was soon fast asleep.    It was dark when he woke. As he moved, Jonas spoke.    \"Are you awake, John? Because if you are, let us have something to  eat. I have been awake the last four hours, and I have been wishing  you would stir.\"    \"There was no occasion to wait for my waking, Jonas. There are the  grain and the water, close at hand; and no cooking is required.\"    \"I wasn't going to eat till you woke, if it had been all night,\"  Jonas said. \"Still, I am glad you are awake; they are quiet now, up  above, and I have heard the Roman trumpets sounding. I expect that  most of them have marched back to their camp.\"    The next day passed like the first. Occasionally cries of agony  were heard. Sometimes bodies were hurled from the top of the rock,  but a short distance from where they were lying.    The next two days passed more quietly, but upon that following a  murmur, as of a multitude of men working, was heard. From time to  time there were heavy crashes, as masses of stones, hurled down the  precipice, struck against its face as they fell; and then bounded,  far out beyond the stream, at its foot. All these sounds were  echoed back by the surrounding hills, until it seemed as if a storm  was raging, far away in the heart of the mountains.    \"They are destroying the town,\" John said, in answer to his  companion's question as to the cause of the uproar. \"That is the  best thing possible for us. Had it remained standing, they might  have left a garrison here, to prevent our people reoccupying it. If  they destroy it, it is a sign that they intend to march away,  altogether.\"    Several times Jonas wished to climb up, at night, to ascertain what  was going on; but John would not hear of it.    \"There is nothing to find out, Jonas. We know what they did at  Gadara, where they slew all the males and carried off all the  women, although no resistance was offered. We may be sure that  there will be no more mercy shown at Jotapata, which has affronted  the Roman power by keeping their great army at bay, for nearly  seven weeks, and whose capture has cost them thousands of men. We  know what has happened--they have slain every soul, save a few  young women, who were worth money as slaves. Now they are leveling  the town to its foundations. The place that defied them will cease  to exist.    \"And yet, they talk of Roman magnanimity! Would we had five  thousand fighting men, hidden here with us. We would climb then,  Jonas, and fall upon them in the night, and take a mighty vengeance  for the woes they have inflicted. But, being alone, we will remain  here till we have reason to believe that the last Roman has left.  Did one of them catch sight of you, our fate would be sealed. They  have no boys among them, and the slightest glimpse of your figure  would be enough to tell them that you were a Jew who had been in  hiding and, in their fear that one man should escape their  vengeance, they would hunt you down, as a pack of wolves might hunt  down a solitary lamb.\"    \"They could never get down here, John.\"    \"Not by the way you came; but they would lower a cage full of armed  men, from above, and slay us without pity.\"    \"But if I were found out, John, I would not lead them here. I would  throw myself over the precipice, rather than that risk should come  to you!\"    \"But I don't want you to throw yourself over the precipice, Jonas.  I want to keep you with me: in the first place because we are great  friends now; in the second because, if you were killed, I might as  well throw myself over, at once--for I do not think I could ever  climb up this rock, without your assistance.\"    \"It is much easier going up than coming down, John.\"    \"That may be and, indeed, I have no doubt it is so; but I would  rather not put the matter to the test. No; we have provision and  water here, enough to last us for ten days and, until they are  consumed, it were best not to stir from here.\"    Four days later, however, they heard the sound of the Roman  trumpets and, on raising their heads carefully a few inches, saw  that the guards on the opposite hills had all been withdrawn.  Having now less fear of being seen, they raised their heads still  further, and looked up the valley to the great camp on the hillside  where, at night, they had seen the fires of the Romans, blazing  high.    \"They are going!\" Jonas exclaimed, joyously. \"Look at the sun  sparkling on the long lines of arms and armor.

The collection was published after his death.    Contemplative men seem to be fond of amusements which accord with their  habits. The thoughtful game of chess, and the tranquil delight of  angling, have been favourite recreations with the studious. Paley had  himself painted with a rod and line in his hand; a strange  characteristic for the author of \"Natural Theology.\" Sir Henry Wotton  called angling \"idle time not idly spent:\" we may suppose that his  meditations and his amusements were carried on at the same moment.    The amusements of the great d'Aguesseau, chancellor of France, consisted  in an interchange of studies; his relaxations were all the varieties of  literature. \"Le changement de l'etude est mon seul delassement,\" said  this great man; and \"in the age of the passions, his only passion was  study.\"    Seneca has observed on amusements proper for literary men, that, in  regard to robust exercises, it is not decent to see a man of letters  exult in the strength of his arm, or the breadth of his back! Such  amusements diminish the activity of the mind. Too much fatigue exhausts  the animal spirits, as too much food blunts the finer faculties: but  elsewhere he allows his philosopher an occasional slight inebriation; an  amusement which was very prevalent among our poets formerly, when they  exclaimed:--        \"Fetch me Ben Jonson's scull, and fill't with sack,      Rich as the same he drank, when the whole pack      Of jolly sisters pledged, and did agree      It was no sin to be as drunk as he!\"    Seneca concludes admirably, \"whatever be the amusements you choose,  return not slowly from those of the body to the mind; exercise the  latter night and day. The mind is nourished at a cheap rate; neither  cold nor heat, nor age itself, can interrupt this exercise; give  therefore all your cares to a possession which ameliorates even in its  old age!\"    An ingenious writer has observed, that \"a garden just accommodates  itself to the perambulations of a scholar, who would perhaps rather wish  his walks abridged than extended.\" There is a good characteristic  account of the mode in which the Literati may take exercise, in Pope's  Letters. \"I, like a poor squirrel, am continually in motion indeed, but  it is but a cage of three foot! my little excursions are like those of a  shopkeeper, who walks every day a mile or two before his own door, but  minds his business all the while.\" A turn or two in a garden will often  very happily close a fine period, mature an unripened thought, and raise  up fresh associations, whenever the mind, like the body, becomes rigid  by preserving the same posture. Buffon often quitted the old tower he  studied in, which was placed in the midst of his garden, for a walk in  it. Evelyn loved \"books and a garden.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 21: The same anecdote is related of Dr. Johnson, who once  being at a club where other literary men were indulging in jests, upon  the entry of a new visitor exclaimed, \"Let us be grave--here is a fool  coming.\"]          PORTRAITS OF AUTHORS.      With the ancients, it was undoubtedly a custom to place the portraits of  authors before their works. Martial's 186th epigram of his fourteenth  book is a mere play on words, concerning a little volume containing the  works of Virgil, and which had his portrait prefixed to it. The volume  and the characters must have been very diminutive.        _Quam brevis immensum cepit membrana Maronem!      Ipsius Vultus prima tabella gerit._    Martial is not the only writer who takes notice of the ancients  prefixing portraits to the works of authors. Seneca, in his ninth  chapter on the Tranquillity of the Soul, complains of many of the  luxurious great, who, like so many of our own collectors, possessed  libraries as they did their estates and equipages. \"It is melancholy to  observe how the portraits of men of genius, and the works of their  divine intelligence, are used only as the luxury and the ornaments of  walls.\"    Pliny has nearly the same observation, _lib._ xxxv. _cap._ 2. He  remarks, that the custom was rather modern in his time; and attributes  to Asinius Pollio the honour of having introduced it into Rome. \"In  consecrating a library with the portraits of our illustrious authors, he  has formed, if I may so express myself, a republic of the intellectual  powers of men.\" To the richness of book-treasures, Asinius Pollio had  associated a new source of pleasure, by placing the statues of their  authors amidst them, inspiring the minds of the spectators, even by  their eyes.    A taste for collecting portraits, or busts, was warmly pursued in the  happier periods of Rome; for the celebrated Atticus, in a work he  published of illustrious Romans, made it more delightful, by ornamenting  it with the portraits of those great men; and the learned Varro, in his  biography of Seven Hundred celebrated Men, by giving the world their  true features and their physiognomy _in some manner, aliquo modo  imaginibus_ is Pliny's expression, showed that even their persons should  not entirely be annihilated; they indeed, adds Pliny, form a spectacle  which the gods themselves might contemplate; for if the gods sent those  heroes to the earth, it is Varro who secured their immortality, and has  so multiplied and distributed them in all places, that we may carry  them about us, place them wherever we choose, and fix our eyes on them  with perpetual admiration. A spectacle that every day becomes more  varied and interesting, as new heroes appear, and as works of this kind  are spread abroad.    But as printing was unknown, to the ancients (though _stamping an  impression_ was daily practised, and, in fact, they possessed the art of  printing without being aware of it[22]), how were these portraits of  Varro so easily propagated? If copied with a pen, their correctness was  in some danger, and their diffusion must have been very confined and  slow; perhaps they were outlines. This passage of Pliny excites  curiosity difficult to satisfy; I have in vain inquired of several  scholars, particularly of the late Grecian, Dr. Burney.    A collection of the portraits of illustrious characters affords not only  a source of entertainment and curiosity, but displays the different  modes or habits of the time; and in settling our floating ideas upon the  true features of famous persons, they also fix the chronological  particulars of their birth, age, death, sometimes with short characters  of them, besides the names of painter and engraver. It is thus a single  print, by the hand of a skilful artist, may become a varied banquet. To  this Granger adds, that in a collection of engraved portraits, the  contents of many galleries are reduced into the narrow compass of a few  volumes; and the portraits of eminent persons, who distinguished  themselves through a long succession of ages, may be turned over in a  few hours.    \"Another advantage,\" Granger continues, \"attending such an assemblage  is, that the methodical arrangement has a surprising effect upon the  memory. We see the celebrated contemporaries of every age almost at one  view; and the mind is insensibly led to the history of that period. I  may add to these, an important circumstance, which is, the power that  such a collection will have in _awakening genius_. A skilful preceptor  will presently perceive the true bent of the temper of his pupil, by his  being struck with a Blake or a Boyle, a Hyde or a Milton.\"    A circumstance in the life of Cicero confirms this observation. Atticus  had a gallery adorned with the images or portraits of the great men of  Rome, under each of which he had severally described their principal  acts and honours, in a few concise verses of his own composition. It was  by the contemplation of two of these portraits (the ancient Brutus and a  venerable relative in one picture) that Cicero seems to have incited  Brutus, by the example of these his great ancestors, to dissolve the  tyranny of Caesar. General Fairfax made a collection of engraved  portraits of warriors. A story much in favour of portrait-collectors is  that of the Athenian courtesan, who, in the midst of a riotous banquet  with her lovers, accidentally casting her eyes on the _portrait_ of a  philosopher that hung opposite to her seat, the happy character of  temperance and virtue struck her with so lively an image of her own  unworthiness, that she suddenly retreated for ever from the scene of  debauchery. The Orientalists have felt the same charm in their pictured  memorials; for \"the imperial Akber,\" says Mr. Forbes, in his Oriental  Memoirs, \"employed artists to make portraits of all the principal omrahs  and officers in his court;\" they were bound together in a thick volume,  wherein, as the Ayeen Akbery, or the Institutes of Akber, expresses it,  \"The PAST are kept in lively remembrance; and the PRESENT are insured  immortality.\"    Leonard Aretin, when young and in prison, found a portrait of Petrarch,  on which his eyes were perpetually fixed; and this sort of contemplation  inflamed the desire of imitating this great man. Buffon hung the  portrait of Newton before his writing-table.    On this subject, Tacitus sublimely expresses himself at the close of his  admired biography of Agricola: \"I do not mean to censure the custom of  preserving in brass or marble the shape and stature of eminent men; but  busts and statues, like their originals, are frail and perishable. The  soul is formed of finer elements, its inward form is not to be expressed  by the hand of an artist with unconscious matter; our manners and our  morals may in some degree trace the resemblance. All of Agricola that  gained our love and raised our admiration still subsists, and ever will  subsist, preserved in the minds of men, the register of ages "]]]
