It seems to me that no one could define  exactly what was meant. The convention that makes the poet in  Pennsylvania write as if the banks of the Wissahickon were peopled by  thrushes, or orchestrated by the mavis, or the soaring lark, causes him  often to borrow words from the English vocabulary of England without  analyzing their exact meaning. There can be no doubt that Don Quixote  was a gentleman but not exactly in the English conventional sense. And,  if he was a gentleman, why are not Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller  gentlemen? An interesting thesis might be written on the application of  Cardinal Newman's definition of a gentleman to both Mr. Pickwick and Sam  Weller. Why not?    There is a truth about the English people, at least the lower classes,  which Mr. Chesterton in his illuminating \"Appreciations and Criticisms  of the Works of Charles Dickens\"--one of his best books--brings out,  though he does not accentuate it sufficiently: this is that the lower  classes of the English are both witty and humorous. Witty because they  are satirical and humorous because they are ironical. Sam Weller  represents a type--a common type--more exactly than Samuel Lover's  \"Handy Andy\" or any of Charles Lever's Irish characters. When one  examines the foundation for the assertion that Dickens could not draw a  lady or a gentleman, one discovers that his ladies and gentlemen, in the  English sense, are deadly dull. It is very probable that all  conventional ladies and gentlemen bored Dickens, who never ceased to be  a cockney, though he became the most sublimated of that class. Doctor  Johnson was a cockney, too, but, though it may seem paradoxical to say  it, not so greatly impressed by class distinctions as Dickens was.    Dickens had the art of making insupportable bores most interesting. This  was an art in which the delicate Miss Austen excelled, too; but  Dickens's methods compared to hers are like those of a scene painter  when compared to those of an etcher in colours. There are times when  Dickens is consciously \"common,\" and then he is almost unbearable; but  this objection cannot be made to the \"Pickwick Papers.\" This book is  inartistic; it is made up of unrelated parts; the characters do not  grow; they change. But all this makes no difference. They are  spontaneous. You feel that for once Dickens is doing the thing he likes  to do--and all the world loves a lover who loves his work.    There are doubtless some people still living who can tolerate the  romantic quality in \"Nicholas Nickleby.\" There are no really romantic  qualities in the \"Pickwick Papers\"--thank heaven!--no stick of a hero,  no weeping willow of a heroine. The heroic sticks of Dickens never bloom  suddenly as the branch in \"Tannh[:a]user\" bloomed. Even Dickens can work no  miracle there.    It increases our admiration of him to examine the works of those  gentlemen who are set down in the textbooks of literature as his  predecessors. Some of these learned authors mention Sterne's \"Tristram  Shandy,\" a very dull and tiresome narrative; and \"Tom Jones,\" very  tiresome, too, in spite of its fidelity to certain phases of  eighteenth-century life. And later, Pierce Egan's \"Tom and Jerry.\" I was  brought up to consider the renown of the two Pierce Egans with reverence  and permitted to read \"Tom and Jerry; or The Adventures of Corinthian  Bob\" as part of the family pedigree, but it requires the meticulous  analysis of a German research-worker to find any real resemblance  between the artificial dissipations of \"Tom and Jerry\" and the  adventures of the peerless Pickwick.    If the elder Pierce Egan had the power of influencing disciples, he  ought to have induced his son to produce something better than \"The Poor  Boy; or, The Betrayed Baffled,\" \"The Fair Lilias,\" and others too  numerous to mention.    The voracious reader of Dickens, as he grows older, perhaps becomes a  student of Dickens, and is surprised to find that the development of  Dickens is much more marked and easily noted than the development of  Thackeray. In fact, Thackeray, like his mild reflector, Du Maurier,  sprang into the public light fully equipped and fully armed. Both these  men had wide experience and a careful training in form and proportion  before they attempted to write seriously. They were educated in art and  life and letters. The education of Dickens, on the other hand, was only  begun with \"Pickwick,\" which knew neither method nor proportion; and he  who reads \"Barnaby Rudge\" for the flavour of Dickens finds a new and  good perspective and proportion, and even self-restraint. Artistically,  it is the best of all Dickens's novels. For that reason it lacks that  flavour which we find in the earlier books. I could not get such  thorough enjoyment from it as from \"Nicholas Nickleby.\" In it Dickens  sacrificed too much to his self-restraint, and there is no moment in it  that gives us the joy of the discovery of Mr. and Mrs. Vincent Crummles  or of 'Tilda Price.    Anthony Trollope, in his \"Autobiography,\" which ought to be a textbook  in all those practical classes of literature that work to turn out  self-supporting authors, tells us that the most important part of a  novel is the plot. This may be true, but the inefficiency of the plot in  the works of Charles Dickens may easily be shown in an attempt to  summarize any of them, except \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\"    Still, when all is said for Dickens, one cannot even in old age begin to  read him over and over again, as one can read Thackeray. But who reads  an American book over and over again? Hawthorne never wearies the elect,  and one may go back to Henry James, in order to discover whether one  thinks that he means the same thing in 1922 one thought he meant in  1912. But who makes it a practice in middle age to read any novel of  Mrs. Wharton's or Mrs. Deland's or Mr. Marion Crawford's or Mr. Booth  Tarkington's at least once a year? There are thousands of persons who  find leisure to love Miss Austen, that hardiest of hardy perennials;  and during the war, when life in the daytime became a nightmare, there  was a large group of persons who read Trollope from end to end! This is  almost incredible; but it is true. And I must confess that if I do not  read Miss Austen's novels once every year, preferably cozily in the  winter, or \"Cranford,\" or parts of Froissart--whose chronicle takes the  bad taste of Mark Twain's \"Joan of Arc\" from my memory--I feel as if I  had had an ill-spent year. It makes me seem as slothful as if I omitted  a daily passage from \"The Following of Christ\" or, at least, a weekly  chapter from the Epistles of St. Paul!    George Eliot I had known even before the time I had begun to read. No  well-brought-up child could escape \"Adam Bede\" and the drolleries of  Mrs. Poyser. As I grew older, however, \"Romola\" attracted me most. The  heroine is perhaps a little too good for human nature's daily food, but  she is a great figure in the picture. I suspect that the artificiality  of Kingsley's \"Hypatia,\" which I read at almost the same time, made me  admire, if I did not love, Romola, by way of contrast. No youth could  ever love Romola as Walter Scott made him love Mary Stuart or Catherine  Seton. But as it happened that just at this time I was labouring with  Blackstone (Judge Sharswood's Notes), with a volume of scholastic  philosophy \"on the side\"--I think it was Jourdain's _consomm['e]_ of St.  Thomas Aquinas in French--Romola was a decided relief, and she seemed  truer and more interesting in every way than Hypatia, who was as  _papier-mach['e]_ as her whole environment is untrue to the history of the  time. An historical novel ought not necessarily to be true to history,  but it ought to be illuminating and interesting, as \"Hypatia\" is not and  as \"Romola\" is. So it makes no difference whether George Eliot's reading  of Savonarola is correct or not, though it ought to be correct, of  course. Then there is Tito, the delicious and treacherous Tito! and the  scene in the barber shop! And if you want a good, mouth-filling novel,  give me \"Middlemarch.\" Few persons read it now, and probably fewer will  read it in the future. It is nevertheless a great monument to the genius  of a woman who had such an infinite quality for taking pains, that it  almost defeated the end for which she worked.          CHAPTER IV    LETTERS, BIOGRAPHIES, AND MEMOIRS      Some of us have acquired a state of mind which helps us to believe that  whenever a man mentions a book he either condemns or approves of it. In  a word, the mere naming a book means a criticism of the book at once. It  is true that books are criticisms of life, and that life, if it is not  very narrow and limited, is a good criticism of books; but one of the  most pleasant qualities of a reader who has lived among books all his  life is that he does not attempt always to recommend books to others, or  to preach about them. Besides, it is too dangerous to recommend  unreservedly or to condemn unreservedly. The teachers of literature have  undertaken the recommendation of books for the young; there are schools  of critics who spend their time in approving of them for the old; and  the \"Index\" at Rome assumes the difficult task of disapproval and  condemnation. That lets me out, I feel.    One of my most cherished books is the \"Letters to People in the World,\"  by Saint Francis de Sales. I have known people who have declared that it  is entirely exotic and has no meaning whatever for them. For me, it is a  book of edification and a guide to life; and the \"Letters\" of Saint  Francis himself, not entirely concerned with spiritual matters or the  relations of spiritual matters to life, are to me a constant source of  pleasure. I remember reading aloud to a friend the passage in which this  charming Bishop writes that, when he slept at his paternal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24025"],[0,"The New Girl at St. Chad's: A Story of School Life (#19)"],[1,"twice as binding as those enforced by the authorities.    The bedrooms at St. Chad's were on two floors, Nos. 9 to 16 being on  the upper story, and Nos. 1 to 7 on the lower. No. 8, occupied by Honor  and Janie, was the higher of two small rooms built over the porch, and  occupied a position midway between the two floors, being reached by a  short flight of steps from the landing below. In No. 4 slept Evelyn  Fletcher, the youngest girl in the house. She shared the room with an  elder sister and two cousins, all three members of the Sixth Form.  Though Evelyn was thirteen, she was very small and childish for her  age, and was treated rather as a pet by the Chaddites. She was a pretty  little thing, with appealing blue eyes, fluffy hair, and a helpless,  dependent manner. It was the great trial of her life that she was  obliged to go to bed more than an hour before the other occupants of  No. 4. She had a morbid horror of being alone in the dark--a horror  that, through a sensitive dread of being laughed at, she had so far  confessed to no one, but which, all the same, was very real and  overwhelming. Night after night she would lie with the curtain of her  cubicle half-drawn, and the door ajar so as to catch a gleam of light  from the landing, listening with every nerve on the alert for she knew  not what, and enduring agonies until the welcome moment when her sister  Meta came upstairs. It was, of course, very foolish, but her terror was  probably due to a dangerous illness from which she had suffered some  years before, and which had left a permanent delicacy.    One evening the younger girls had retired as usual, and everything was  very quiet in the upper stories. Evelyn lay wideawake, sometimes  straining her ears to catch a sound from the ground floor below, and  sometimes burying her head in her pillow. Suddenly she sat up in bed,  with wide-open, terror-stricken eyes. On the opposite wall there  gleamed a strange, dancing light, which appeared and disappeared and  reappeared again, flickering faintly from floor to ceiling. There  seemed no explainable origin for it, and Evelyn's mind at once turned  to the supernatural. A silly maidservant at home had been accustomed to  ply her with ghost stories, all of which now recurred to her memory.  What was it, that unnatural, luminous halo on the opposite wall? It was  moving nearer to her, and had almost reached the curtain of her  cubicle, when, with a choking little gasp, she sprang out of bed, and  darting into the corridor ran shrieking upstairs, her one idea being to  escape from the mysterious apparition.    Her screams not only roused all the girls on the higher rooms, but  brought up Vivian Holmes, who had been crossing the hall at the moment,  and felt it her duty as monitress to go and investigate.    \"What's all this noise about?\" she asked. \"Evelyn, what's the matter?  Has anything frightened you?\"    \"It's something on my wall,\" panted Evelyn; \"something white, that  moves.\"    \"What was it like?\"    \"I don't know--I can't describe it.\"    \"Perhaps it was a ghost,\" said Honor, in a hollow voice; \"they come  softly, this way,\" and, pulling a horrible face, she moved slowly  forward with a gliding motion, her white night-dress completing the  illusion.    Trembling from head to foot, Evelyn turned and clung to the monitress.    \"Stop that, Honor!\" exclaimed Vivian sharply. \"It's a wicked thing to  frighten anybody. Come along, Evie! I'll go with you to your room, and  we'll try to find out what this mysterious 'something' is. Go back to  bed at once, all the rest of you!\"    After making a thorough inspection of No. 4, Vivian found that the  uncanny light was, after all, very easy of explanation. It was nothing  but the reflection from a lamp outside, and the swaying of the blind  had been responsible for the movement. Having shown Evelyn the  unromantic origin of her spectre, the monitress left her, apparently  pacified, and went downstairs.    In the upper rooms all was soon in absolute stillness. The girls took  Vivian's advice and retired to bed again, laughing at having been  disturbed for so trivial a cause.    \"Evelyn Fletcher is a goose!\" said Flossie Taylor. \"She'd run away from  her own shadow.\"    \"She is rather silly,\" agreed Maisie Talbot. \"I've no patience with  people who imagine ghosts!\"    Maisie's own nerves were of the stoutest. She certainly could not  sympathize with superstitious fears, and neither flickering lights nor  possible spectres would have distressed her in the least.    \"When people shriek at nothing and rouse the whole house, they deserve  to have something to shriek at,\" remarked Flossie.    But Maisie was in the act of hopping into bed, and only grunted in  reply, while Pauline and Lettice were already half-asleep. Flossie lay  for a minute or two pondering over the affair, then got up again very  softly. First, she felt on her washstand for her tooth powder, and  dabbed her face plentifully with it till she was sure it must be white  all over; then she took the towel, and arranged it over her head, to  hide her hair. In every bedroom at St. Chad's there were a candle and a  box of matches, in case the electric light should suddenly fail;  Flossie groped for these and found them, and, taking them in her hand,  left the room on tiptoe.    \"Where are you going?\" asked Maisie drowsily, but receiving no reply,  she did not even trouble to open her eyes.    Once outside the door, Flossie lighted her candle. She was determined,  in spite of Vivian's warning, to play a trick upon Evelyn.    \"She needs teasing out of such rubbish,\" she said to herself. \"Vivian  Holmes always makes an absurd fuss of her--quite spoils her, in fact. I  think the best way to cure people is to laugh at them.\"    Creeping softly downstairs, she switched off the electric light at the  end of the lower landing, and, shading her candle with her hand, passed  along in the darkness to No. 4. Without pausing a moment she entered,  holding up one arm in a dramatic attitude, and making her eyes glare  wildly from her whitened face. The effect was beyond all that she had  anticipated. Such a scream of agonized fear came from the bed in the  corner that, alarmed at what she had done, Flossie turned and fled. As  she ran through the door she realized that somebody was hastening along  the dark passage, and, afraid of being discovered, she turned suddenly  and rushed up the short flight of steps that led to Honor's bedroom,  blowing out her candle as she went. She crouched for a few moments  outside the door of No. 8, then, hearing no footsteps pursuing her, she  ventured to steal down again and make a dash for the stairs and the  upper landing, where she whisked into No. 13 with all possible speed.    \"It was a narrow shave!\" she said to herself. \"If that was Vivian, and  she had caught me, I expect she'd have made herself uncommonly  disagreeable.\"    In the meantime, Vivian had returned to the recreation room, and told  the story of Evelyn's groundless fears to the elder girls assembled  there.    \"A shock of this kind is extremely bad for Evie,\" said Meta. \"She had a  nervous fever four years ago, and has been so fragile and highly-strung  ever since. She was sent to Chessington because we hoped the bracing  air might do her good. I remember she used to have night terrors when  she was a wee child, but we thought she had quite got over them.\"    \"She looks very white and delicate,\" said Vivian. \"She's all eyes. If  she were my sister, I should like to see her less 'nervy'.\"    \"Perhaps I had better run upstairs to her,\" said Meta, rather  anxiously. \"Now I think of it, I remember she always seems most  relieved when May and Trissie and I make our appearance at  nine-thirty.\"    Meta found the landing in total darkness, a most unusual occurrence, as  the electric light was always left on there. She felt her way along by  the wall, and as she did so she was aware of somebody coming towards  her from the opposite end of the long corridor. Whoever it was carried  a light in her hand, so small as to make only a faint glimmer, but  enough to allow Meta to perceive that she turned into No. 4. The next  moment a cry of frantic fear issued from the room. Meta hurried  forward, her heart throbbing wildly, while the figure, rushing from the  room, and showing in its hasty flight a white-veiled head, darted up  the steps to No. 8, and disappeared, light and all.    It did not take Meta more than three seconds to reach her sister's  bedside. Strangled sounds issued from under the clothes, where Evelyn  lay cowering in mortal terror; and again, as Meta placed her hand on  the bed, came that convulsive, half-stifled cry.    \"Evie! Evie dear! Don't you know me?\" exclaimed Meta.    Realizing at last who stood near, Evelyn sat up and flung her arms  round her sister. She was in a most agitated, hysterical condition,  trembling and quivering with sobs. Meta soothed her as well as she  could, and requested Vivian, who had followed to see that all was  right, to switch on the bedroom light, and also the one in the passage.    \"Someone must have intentionally turned it off,\" she said, \"on purpose  to play this trick.\"    \"I know I'm silly!\" choked Evelyn, more reassured now that the room was  no longer in darkness, \"but I can't help it. I really thought it was a  ghost.\"    \"Who is responsible for this?\" asked Vivian indignantly.    \"Honor Fitzgerald,\" replied Meta, without hesitation.    \"Are you sure?\"    \"Whoever it was ran back into No. 8. Janie Henderson would never dream  of doing such a thing, so it must have been Honor.\"    \"She certainly was pretending to be a ghost upstairs,\" said Vivian. \"I  shall go and tell her my opinion of her,\" and she departed with a very  grim expression on her face.    Janie and Honor were half-asleep when Vivian, like an avenging angel,  entered No. 8.    \"Look here, Honor Fitzgerald!\" she began, \"if you try any more of those"]]]
