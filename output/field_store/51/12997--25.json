There is hope where there is shame of our  faults. Be equally frank with your sister as with me, and she will win  you, in spite of yourself, from the enchantments of Bigot, Cadet, and  the still more potent smiles you speak of that led you to take the wrong  turn in life.\"    \"I doubt it is too late, Pierre! although I know that, were every other  friend in the world to forsake me, Amelie would not! She would not even  reproach me, except by excess of affection.\"    Philibert looked on his friend admiringly, at this panegyric of the  woman he loved. Le Gardeur was in feature so like his sister that  Philibert at the moment caught the very face of Amelie, as it were,  looking at him through the face of her brother. \"You will not resist her  pleadings, Le Gardeur,\"--Philibert thought it an impossible thing. \"No  guardian angel ever clung to the skirts of a sinner as Amelie will cling  to you,\" said he; \"therefore I have every hope of my dear friend Le  Gardeur Repentigny.\"    The two riders emerged from the forest, and drew up for a minute in  front of the hostelry of the Crown of France, to water their horses at  the long trough before the door and inform Dame Bedard, who ran out to  greet them, that Master Pothier was following with his ambling nag at a  gentle pace, as befitted the gravity of his profession.    \"Oh! Master Pothier never fails to find his way to the Crown of France;  but won't your Honors take a cup of wine? The day is hot and the road  dusty. 'A dry rider makes a wet nag,'\" added the Dame, with a smile, as  she repeated an old saying, brought over with the rest of the butin in  the ships of Cartier and Champlain.    The gentlemen bowed their thanks, and as Philibert looked up, he saw  pretty Zoe Bedard poring over a sheet of paper bearing a red seal, and  spelling out the crabbed law text of Master Pothier. Zoe, like other  girls of her class, had received a tincture of learning in the day  schools of the nuns; but, although the paper was her marriage contract,  it puzzled her greatly to pick out the few chips of plain sense that  floated in the sea of legal verbiage it contained. Zoe, with a perfect  comprehension of the claims of meum and tuum, was at no loss, however,  in arriving at a satisfactory solution of the true merits of her  matrimonial contract with honest Antoine La Chance.    She caught the eye of Philibert, and blushed to the very chin as she  huddled away the paper and returned the salute of the two handsome  gentlemen, who, having refreshed their horses, rode off at a rapid trot  down the great highway that led to the city.    Babet Le Nocher, in a new gown, short enough to reveal a pair of shapely  ankles in clocked stockings and well-clad feet that would have been  the envy of many a duchess, sat on the thwart of the boat knitting. Her  black hair was in the fashion recorded by the grave Peter Kalm, who, in  his account of New France, says, \"The peasant women all wear their hair  in ringlets, and nice they look!\"    \"As I live!\" exclaimed she to Jean, who was enjoying a pipe of native  tobacco, \"here comes that handsome officer back again, and in as great a  hurry to return as he was to go up the highway!\"    \"Ay, ay, Babet! It is plain to see he is either on the King's errand  or his own. A fair lady awaits his return in the city, or one has just  dismissed him where he has been! Nothing like a woman to put quicksilver  in a man's shoes--eh! Babet?\"    \"Or foolish thoughts into their hearts, Jean!\" replied she, laughing.    \"And nothing more natural, Babet, if women's hearts are wise enough in  their folly to like our foolish thoughts of them. But there are two!  Who is that riding with the gentleman? Your eyes are better than mine,  Babet!\"    \"Of course, Jean! that is what I always tell you, but you won't believe  me--trust my eyes, and doubt your own! The other gentleman,\" said she,  looking fixedly, while her knitting lay still in her lap, \"the other is  the young Chevalier de Repentigny. What brings him back before the rest  of the hunting party, I wonder?\"    \"That officer must have been to Beaumanoir, and is bringing the young  seigneur back to town,\" remarked Jean, puffing out a long thread of  smoke from his lips.    \"Well, it must be something better than smoke, Jean!\"--Babet coughed:  she never liked the pipe--\"The young chevalier is always one of the last  to give up when they have one of their three days drinking bouts up at  the Chateau. He is going to the bad, I fear--more's the pity! such a  nice, handsome fellow, too!\"    \"All lies and calumny!\" replied Jean, in a heat. \"Le Gardeur de  Repentigny is the son of my dear old seigneur. He may get drunk, but it  will be like a gentleman if he does, and not like a carter, Babet, or  like a--\"    \"Boatman! Jean; but I don't include you--you have never been the worse  for drinking water since I took care of your liquor, Jean!\"    \"Ay, you are intoxication enough of yourself for me, Babet! Two bright  eyes like yours, a pipe and bitters, with grace before meat, would save  any Christian man in this world.\" Jean stood up, politely doffing his  red tuque to the gentlemen. Le Gardeur stooped from his horse to grasp  his hand, for Jean had been an old servitor at Tilly, and the young  seigneur was too noble-minded and polite to omit a kindly notice of even  the humblest of his acquaintance.    \"Had a busy day, Jean, with the old ferry?\" asked Le Gardeur, cheerily.    \"No, your Honor, but yesterday I think half the country-side crossed  over to the city on the King's corvee. The men went to work, and the  women followed to look after them, ha! ha!\" Jean winked provokingly at  Babet, who took him up sharply.    \"And why should not the women go after the men? I trow men are not so  plentiful in New France as they used to be before this weary war began.  It well behooves the women to take good care of all that are left.\"    \"That is true as the Sunday sermon,\" remarked Jean. \"Why, it was only  the other day I heard that great foreign gentleman, who is the guest of  His Excellency the Governor, say, sitting in this very boat, that 'there  are at this time four women to every man in New France!' If that is  true, Babet,--and you know he said it, for you were angry enough,--a  man is a prize indeed, in New France, and women are plenty as eggs at  Easter!\"    \"The foreign gentleman had much assurance to say it, even if it were  true: he were much better employed picking up weeds and putting them in  his book!\" exclaimed Babet, hotly.    \"Come! come!\" cried Le Gardeur, interrupting this debate on the  population; \"Providence knows the worth of Canadian women, and cannot  give us too many of them. We are in a hurry to get to the city, Jean, so  let us embark. My aunt and Amelie are in the old home in the city; they  will be glad to see you and Babet,\" added he, kindly, as he got into the  boat.    Babet dropped her neatest courtesy, and Jean, all alive to his duty,  pushed off his boat, bearing the two gentlemen and their horses across  the broad St. Charles to the King's Quay, where they remounted, and  riding past the huge palace of the Intendant, dashed up the steep Cote  au Chien and through the city gate, disappearing from the eyes of Babet,  who looked very admiringly after them. Her thoughts were especially  commendatory of the handsome officer in full uniform who had been so  polite and generous in the morning.    \"I was afraid, Jean, you were going to blurt out about Mademoiselle des  Meloises,\" remarked Babet to Jean on his return; \"men are so indiscreet  always!\"    \"Leaky boats! leaky boats! Babet! no rowing them with a woman aboard!  sure to run on the bank. But what about Mademoiselle des Meloises?\"  Honest Jean had passed her over the ferry an hour ago, and been sorely  tempted to inform Le Gardeur of the interesting fact.    \"What about Mademoiselle des Meloises?\" Babet spoke rather sharply.  \"Why, all Quebec knows that the Seigneur de Repentigny is mad in love  with her.\"    \"And why should he not be mad in love with her if he likes?\" replied  Jean; \"she is a morsel fit for a king, and if Le Gardeur should lose  both his heart and his wits on her account, it is only what half the  gallants of Quebec have done.\"    \"Oh, Jean, Jean! it is plain to see you have an eye in your head as well  as a soft place!\" ejaculated Babet, recommencing her knitting with fresh  vigor, and working off the electricity that was stirring in her.    \"I had two eyes in my head when I chose you, Babet, and the soft place  was in my heart!\" replied Jean, heartily. The compliment was taken with  a smile, as it deserved to be. \"Look you, Babet, I would not give this  pinch of snuff,\" said Jean, raising his thumb and two fingers holding  a good dose of the pungent dust,--\"I would not give this pinch of snuff  for any young fellow who could be indifferent to the charms of such a  pretty lass as Angelique des Meloises!\"    \"Well, I am glad you did not tell the Seigneur de Repentigny that she  had crossed the ferry and gone--not to look for him, I'll be bound! I  will tell you something by and by, Jean, if you will come in and eat  your dinner; I have something you like.\"    \"What is it, Babet?\" Jean was, after all, more curious about his dinner  than about the fair lady.    \"Oh, something you like--that is a wife's secret: keep the stomach of  a man warm, and his heart will never grow cold. What say you to fried  eels?\"    \"Bravo!\" cried the gay old boatman, as he sang,           \"'Ah! ah! ah! frit a l'huile,         Frit au beurre et a l'ognon!'\"      and the jolly couple danced into their little cottage--no king and queen  in Christendom half so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#19)"],[1,"derstanding, set off towards the gaping tribe. They  were quite close now, for the sight of Eudena had driven their fading  fear of the lion out of their heads.    In a moment Eudena had turned from the cowering old woman and overtaken  Si. \"Si!\" she cried, \"Si!\" She caught the child up in her arms as it  stopped, pressed the nail-lined face to hers, and turned about to run  towards her lair, the lair of the old lion. The old woman stood  waist-high in the reeds, and screamed foul things and inarticulate rage,  but did not dare to intercept her; and at the bend of the path Eudena  looked back and saw all the men of the tribe crying to one another and  Siss coming at a trot along the lion's trail.    She ran straight along the narrow way through the reeds to the shady  place where Ugh-lomi sat with his healing thigh, just awakened by the  shouting and rubbing his eyes. She came to him, a woman, with little Si  in her arms. Her heart throbbed in her throat. \"Ugh-lomi!\" she cried,  \"Ugh-lomi, the tribe comes!\"    Ugh-lomi sat staring in stupid astonishment at her and Si.    She pointed with Si in one arm. She sought among her feeble store of  words to explain. She could hear the men calling. Apparently they had  stopped outside. She put down Si and caught up the new club with the  lion's teeth, and put it into Ugh-lomi's hand, and ran three yards and  picked up the first axe.    \"Ah!\" said Ugh-lomi, waving the new club, and suddenly he perceived the  occasion and, rolling over, began to struggle to his feet.    He stood but clumsily. He supported himself by one hand against the  tree, and just touched the ground gingerly with the toe of his wounded  leg. In the other hand he gripped the new club. He looked at his healing  thigh; and suddenly the reeds began whispering, and ceased and whispered  again, and coming cautiously along the track, bending down and holding  his fire-hardened stabbing-stick of ash in his hand, appeared Siss. He  stopped dead, and his eyes met Ugh-lomi's.    Ugh-lomi forgot he had a wounded leg. He stood firmly on both feet.  Something trickled. He glanced down and saw a little gout of blood had  oozed out along the edge of the healing wound. He rubbed his hand there  to give him the grip of his club, and fixed his eyes again on Siss.    \"Wau!\" he cried, and sprang forward, and Siss, still stooping and  watchful, drove his stabbing-stick up very quickly in an ugly thrust. It  ripped Ugh-lomi's guarding arm and the club came down in a counter that  Siss was never to understand. He fell, as an ox falls to the pole-axe,  at Ugh-lomi's feet.    To Bo it seemed the strangest thing. He had a comforting sense of tall  reeds on either side, and an impregnable rampart, Siss, between him and  any danger. Snail-eater was close behind and there was no danger there.  He was prepared to shove behind and send Siss to death or victory. That  was his place as second man. He saw the butt of the spear Siss carried  leap away from him, and suddenly a dull whack and the broad back fell  away forward, and he looked Ugh-lomi in the face over his prostrate  leader. It felt to Bo as if his heart had fallen down a well. He had a  throwing-stone in one hand and an ashen stabbing-stick in the other. He  did not live to the end of his momentary hesitation which to use.    Snail-eater was a readier man, and besides Bo did not fall forward as  Siss had done, but gave at his knees and hips, crumpling up with the  toothed club upon his head. The Snail-eater drove his spear forward  swift and straight, and took Ugh-lomi in the muscle of the shoulder, and  then he drove him hard with the smiting-stone in his other hand,  shouting out as he did so. The new club swished ineffectually through  the reeds. Eudena saw Ugh-lomi come staggering back from the narrow path  into the open space, tripping over Siss and with a foot of ashen stake  sticking out of him over his arm. And then the Snail-eater, whose name  she had given, had his final injury from her, as his exultant face came  out of the reeds after his spear. For she swung the first axe swift and  high, and hit him fair and square on the temple; and down he went on  Siss at prostrate Ugh-lomi's feet.    But before Ugh-lomi could get up, the two red-haired men were tumbling  out of the reeds, spears and smiting-stones ready, and Snake hard behind  them. One she struck on the neck, but not to fell him, and he blundered  aside and spoilt his brother's blow at Ugh-lomi's head. In a moment  Ugh-lomi dropped his club and had his assailant by the waist, and had  pitched him sideways sprawling. He snatched at his club again and  recovered it. The man Eudena had hit stabbed at her with his spear as he  stumbled from her blow, and involuntarily she gave ground to avoid him.  He hesitated between her and Ugh-lomi, half turned, gave a vague cry at  finding Ugh-lomi so near, and in a moment Ugh-lomi had him by the  throat, and the club had its third victim. As he went down Ugh-lomi  shouted--no words, but an exultant cry.    The other red-haired man was six feet from her with his back to her, and  a darker red streaking his head. He was struggling to his feet. She had  an irrational impulse to stop his rising. She flung the axe at him,  missed, saw his face in profile, and he had swerved beyond little Si,  and was running through the reeds. She had a transitory vision of Snake  standing in the throat of the path, half turned away from her, and then  she saw his back. She saw the club whirling through the air, and the  shock head of Ugh-lomi, with blood in the hair and blood upon the  shoulder, vanishing below the reeds in pursuit. Then she heard Snake  scream like a woman.    She ran past Si to where the handle of the axe stuck out of a clump of  fern, and turning, found herself panting and alone with three motionless  bodies. The air was full of shouts and screams. For a space she was sick  and giddy, and then it came into her head that Ugh-lomi was being killed  along the reed-path, and with an inarticulate cry she leapt over the  body of Bo and hurried after him. Snake's feet lay across the path, and  his head was among the reeds. She followed the path until it bent round  and opened out by the alders, and thence she saw all that was left of  the tribe in the open, scattering like dead leaves before a gale, and  going back over the knoll. Ugh-lomi was hard upon Cat's-skin.    But Cat's-skin was fleet of foot and got away, and so did young Wau-Hau  when Ugh-lomi turned upon him, and Ugh-lomi pursued Wau-Hau far beyond  the knoll before he desisted. He had the rage of battle on him now, and  the wood thrust through his shoulder stung him like a spur. When she saw  he was in no danger she stopped running and stood panting, watching the  distant active figures run up and vanish one by one over the knoll. In a  little time she was alone again. Everything had happened very swiftly.  The smoke of Brother Fire rose straight and steady from the  squatting-place, just as it had done ten minutes ago, when the old woman  had stood yonder worshipping the lion.    And after a long time, as it seemed, Ugh-lomi reappeared over the knoll,  and came back to Eudena, triumphant and breathing heavily. She stood,  her hair about her eyes and hot-faced, with the blood-stained axe in her  hand, at the place where the tribe had offered her as a sacrifice to the  lion. \"Wau!\" cried Ugh-lomi at the sight of her, his face alight with  the fellowship of battle, and he waved his new club, red now and hairy;  and at the sight of his glowing face her tense pose relaxed somewhat,  and she stood sobbing and rejoicing.    Ugh-lomi had a queer unaccountable pang at the sight of her tears; but  he only shouted \"Wau!\" the louder and shook the axe east and west. He  called manfully to her to follow him and turned back, striding, with the  club swinging in his hand, towards the squatting-place, as if he had  never left the tribe; and she ceased her weeping and followed quickly as  a woman should.    So Ugh-lomi and Eudena came back to the squatting-place from which they  had fled many days before from the face of Uya; and by the  squatting-place lay a deer half eaten, just as there had been before  Ugh-lomi was man or Eudena woman. So Ugh-lomi sat down to eat, and  Eudena beside him like a man, and the rest of the tribe watched them  from safe hiding-places. And after a time one of the elder girls came  back timorously, carrying little Si in her arms, and Eudena called to  them by name, and offered them food. But the elder girl was afraid and  would not come, though Si struggled to come to Eudena. Afterwards, when  Ugh-lomi had eaten, he sat dozing, and at last he slept, and slowly the  others came out of the hiding-places and drew near. And when Ugh-lomi  woke, save that there were no men to be seen, it seemed as though he had  never left the tribe.    Now, there is a thing strange but true: that all through this fight  Ugh-lomi forgot that he was lame, and was not lame, and after he had  rested behold! he was a lame man; and he remained a lame man to the end  of his days.    Cat's-skin and the second red-haired man and Wau-Hau, who chipped flints  cunningly, as his father had done before him, fled from the face of  Ugh-lomi, and none knew where they hid. But two days after they came and  squatted a good way off from the knoll among the bracken under the  chestnuts and watched. Ugh-lomi's rage had gone, he moved to go against  them and did not, and at sundown they went away. That day, too, they  found the old woman among the ferns, where Ugh-lomi had blundered upon  her when he had pursued Wau-Hau. She was dead and more ugly than ever,  but whole. The jackals and vultures had tried her and left her;--she was  ever a wonderful old woman.    The next day the three men came again and squatted nearer, and Wau-Hau  had two rabbits to hold up, and the red-haired man a wood-pigeon, and  Ugh-lomi stood before the women and"]]]
