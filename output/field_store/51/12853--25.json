It was during the reign of  Henry VI. that Joan of Arc came forward alleging her Divine commission  to rescue France from the English invader. But it is not part of our  subject to describe her heroic career. The troublous times which made  the French heroine a name in history were unfavourable to Christmas  festivities. The Royal Christmases of Henry the Sixth were less costly  than those of his immediate predecessors. But as soon as he was old  enough to do so he observed the festival, as did also his soldiers,  even in time of war. Mills[28] mentions that, \"during the memorable  siege of Orleans [1428-9], at the request of the English the  festivities of Christmas suspended the horrors of war, and the  nativity of the Saviour was commemorated to the sound of martial  music. Talbot, Suffolk, and other ornaments of English chivalry made  presents of fruits to the accomplished Dunois, who vied with their  courtesy by presenting to Suffolk some black plush he wished for as a  lining for his dress in the then winter season. The high-spirited  knights of one side challenged the prowest knights of the other, as  their predecessors in chivalry had done. It is observable, however,  that these jousts were not held in honour of the ladies, but the  challenge always declared that if there were in the other host a  knight so generous and loving of his country as to be willing to  combat in her defence, he was invited to present himself.\"    [Illustration: Henry IV.'s Cradle]    In 1433 Henry kept his Christmas at Bury, and in 1436 at Kenilworth  Castle. Nothing remarkable, however, is recorded respecting these  festivities. But some interesting particulars have been preserved of a      CHRISTMAS PLAY PERFORMED IN 1445    at Middleton Tower, Norfolk, the family seat of Lord Scales, one of  the early owners of Sandringham, which is now a residence of the  Prince of Wales. Mrs. Herbert Jones[29] says:--    \"One winter, when he was about forty-six years old, in a quiet  interval soon after Henry the Sixth's marriage to Margaret of Anjou,  Lord Scales and his wife were living at Middleton. In a south-east  direction lay the higher ground where rose the Blackborough Priory of  nuns, founded by a previous Lady Scales; west of them, at three miles'  distance, bristling with the architecture of the Middle Ages in all  its bloom and beauty, before religious disunion had defaced it,  prosperous in its self-government, stood the town of Lynn.    \"The mayor and council had organised a play to be acted on Christmas  Day, 1445, before the Lord Scales at Middleton, representing scenes  from the Nativity of our Lord. Large sums were paid by order of the  mayor for the requisite dresses, ornaments, and scenery, some of which  were supplied by the 'Nathan' of Lynn, and others prepared and bought  expressly. 'John Clerk' performed the angel Gabriel, and a lady of the  name of Gilbert the Virgin Mary. Their parts were to be sung. Four  other performers were also paid for their services, and the whole  party, headed by the mayor, set off with their paraphernalia in a  cart, harnessed to four or more horses, for Middleton on Christmas  morning. The breakfast of the carters was paid for at the inn by the  town, but the magnates from Lynn and the actors were entertained at  the castle.[30]    \"It was in the courtyard that this quaint representation took place;  the musical dialogues, the songs and hymns, the profusion of  ornaments, personal and otherwise, recorded as pressed on to the  stage, the grotesque angel and virgin, must have furnished a lively  hour under the castle walls on that long-ago Christmas Day.\"      THE WARS OF THE ROSES.    During the destructive wars of York and Lancaster the festivities of  Christmas were frequently interrupted by hostilities, for some of the  most bloody encounters (as, for example, the terrible battle of  Wakefield) occurred at Christmastide. The wars of the contending  factions continued throughout the reign of Henry VI., whose personal  weakness left the House of Lancaster at the mercy of the Parliament,  in which the voice of the Barons was paramount. That the country was  in a state of shameful misgovernment was shown by the attitude of the  commercial class and the insurrection under John Cade; yet Henry could  find time for amusement. \"Under pretence of change of air the court  removed to Coventry that the king might enjoy the sports of the  field.\"[31]    The Christmases of Henry were not kept with the splendour which  characterised those of his rival and successor, Edward IV. Henry's  habits were religious, and his house expenses parsimonious--sometimes  necessarily so, for he was short of money. From the introduction to  the \"Paston Letters\" (edited by Mr. James Gairdner) it appears that  the king was in such impecunious circumstances in 1451 that he had to  borrow his expenses for Christmas: \"The government was getting  paralysed alike by debt and by indecision. 'As for tidings here,'  writes John Bocking, 'I certify you all that is nought, or will be  nought. The king borroweth his expenses.'\" Henry anticipated what Ben  Jonson discovered in a later age, that--     \"Christmas is near;    And neither good cheer,    Mirth, fooling, nor wit,    Nor any least fit    Of gambol or sport    Will come at the Court,    If there be no money.\"    And so rather than leave Christmas unobserved the poor king \"borrowed  his expenses.\" Subsequently Henry's health failed, and then later  comes the record: \"At Christmas [1454], to the great joy of the  nation, the king began to recover from his painful illness. He woke  up, as it were, from a long sleep. So decidedly had he regained his  faculties that on St. John's Day (27th December) he commanded his  almoner to ride to Canterbury with an offering, and his secretary to  present another at the shrine of St. Edward.\"[32]    The terrible battle of Wakefield at Christmastide, 1460, was one of  the most important victories won by the Lancastrians during the Wars  of the Roses. The king, Henry VI., had secretly encouraged Richard,  Duke of York, that the nation would soon be ready to assent to the  restoration of the legitimate branch of the royal family. Richard was  the son of Anne Mortimer, who was descended from Philippa, the only  daughter of the Duke of Clarence, second son of Edward III.; and  consequently he stood in the order of succession before the king  actually on the throne, who was descended from John of Gaunt, a  younger son of Edward III. The Duke of York at length openly advanced  his title as the true heir to the crown, and urged Parliament to  confer it upon him. As, however, the Lancastrian branch of the royal  family had enjoyed the crown for three generations it was resolved  that Henry VI. should continue to reign during his life and that  Richard should succeed him. This compromise greatly displeased the  queen, Margaret, who was indignant at the injury it inflicted on her  son. She therefore urged the nobles who had hitherto supported her  husband to take up arms on behalf of his son. Accordingly the Earl of  Northumberland, with Lords Dacre, Clifford, and Nevil, assembled an  army at York, and were soon joined by the Duke of Somerset and the  Earl of Devon. \"Parliament being prorogued in December, the Duke of  York and the Earl of Salisbury hastened from London with a large armed  force towards York, but coming unexpectedly upon the troops of the  Duke of Somerset at Worksop, their vanguard was destroyed. On the 21st  of December, however, they reached Sandal Castle with six thousand  men, and kept their Christmas there, notwithstanding that the enemy  under the Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Northumberland were close  by at Pontefract\" (_William Wyrcester_). On the 30th of December the  opposing forces met at Wakefield, and in the terrible battle which  ensued Richard, Duke of York was slain, his son, Lord Rutland, was  murdered by Lord Clifford while escaping from the battlefield, and the  Earl of Salisbury and others were taken as prisoners to Pontefract,  where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22072"],[0,"Folk-Lore and Legends: North American Indian (#19)"],[1,"thought, he patted the ball of clay upon the top,  which made it very broad and low, for Chemanitou was thinking of the  panther feet and the buffalo neck. He remembered the Puck-wud-jinnies  playing in the eye sockets of the great unfinished animal, and he  bethought him to set the eyes out, like those of a lobster, so that  the animal might see on every side.    He made the forehead broad and full, but low, for here was to be the  wisdom of the forked tongue, like that of the serpent, which should be  in its mouth. It should see all things and know all things. Here  Chemanitou stopped, for he saw that he had never thought of such a  creation before, one with two feet--a creature that should stand  upright, and see upon every side.    The jaws were very strong, with ivory teeth and gills upon either  side, which rose and fell whenever breath passed through them. The  nose was like the beak of the vulture. A tuft of porcupine-quills made  the scalp lock.    Chemanitou held the head out the length of his arm, and turned it  first upon one side and then upon the other. He passed it rapidly  through the air, and saw the gills rise and fall, the lobster eyes  whirl round, and the vulture nose look keen.    Chemanitou became very sad, yet he put the head upon the shoulders. It  was the first time he had made an upright figure. It seemed to be the  first idea of a man.    It was now nearly right. The bats were flying through the air, and the  roar of wild beasts began to be heard. A gusty wind swept in from the  ocean and passed over the island of Metowac, casting the light sand to  and fro. A wavy scud was skimming along the horizon, while higher up  in the sky was a dark thick cloud, upon the verge of which the moon  hung for a moment and was then shut in.    A panther came by and stayed a moment, with one foot raised and bent  inward, while it looked up at the image and smelt the feet that were  like its own.    A vulture swooped down with a great noise of its wings, and made a  dash at the beak, but Chemanitou held it back.    Then came the porcupine, the lizard, and the snake, each drawn by its  kind in the image.    Chemanitou veiled his face for many hours, and the gusty wind swept  by, but he did not stir.    He saw that every beast of the earth seeks its kind, and that which  is like draws its likeness to itself.    The Master of Life thought and thought. The idea grew into his mind  that at some time he would create a creature who should be made, not  after the things of the earth, but after himself.    The being should link this world to the spirit world, being made in  the likeness of the Great Spirit, he should be drawn unto his  likeness.    Many days and nights--whole seasons--passed while Chemanitou thought  upon these things. He saw all things.    Then the Master of Life lifted up his head. The stars were looking  down upon the image, and a bat had alighted upon the forehead,  spreading its great wings upon each side. Chemanitou took the bat and  held out its whole leathery wings (and ever since the bat, when he  rests, lets his body hang down), so that he could try them over the  head of the image. He then took the life of the bat away, and twisted  off the body, by which means the whole thin part fell down over the  head of the image and upon each side, making the ears, and a covering  for the forehead like that of the hooded serpent.    Chemanitou did not cut off the face of the image below, but went on  and made a chin and lips that were firm and round, that they might  shut in the forked tongue and ivory teeth, and he knew that with the  lips the image would smile when life should be given to it.    The image was now complete save for the arms, and Chemanitou saw that  it was necessary it should have hands. He grew more grave.    He had never given hands to any creature. He made the arms and the  hands very beautiful, after the manner of his own.    Chemanitou now took no pleasure in the work he had done. It was not  good in his sight.    He wished he had not given it hands. Might it not, when trusted with  life, create? Might it not thwart the plans of the Master of Life  himself?    He looked long at the image. He saw what it would do when life should  be given it. He knew all things.    He now put fire in the image, but fire is not life.    He put fire within and a red glow passed through and through it. The  fire dried the clay of which the image was made, and gave the image an  exceedingly fierce aspect. It shone through the scales upon the  breast, through the gills, and the bat-winged ears. The lobster eyes  were like a living coal.    Chemanitou opened the side of the image, but he did not enter. He had  given it hands and a chin.    It could smile like the manitoes themselves.    He made it walk all about the island of Metowac, that he might see how  it would act. This he did by means of his will.    He now put a little life into it, but he did not take out the fire.  Chemanitou saw the aspect of the creature would be very terrible, and  yet that it could smile in such a manner that it ceased to be ugly.  He thought much upon these things. He felt that it would not be best  to let such a creature live--a creature made up mostly from the beasts  of the field, but with hands of power, a chin lifting the head upward,  and lips holding all things within themselves.    While he thought upon these things he took the image in his hands and  cast it into the cave. But Chemanitou forgot to take out the life.    The creature lay a long time in the cave and did not stir, for its  fall was very great. It lay amongst the old creations that had been  thrown in there without life.    Now when a long time had passed Chemanitou heard a great noise in the  cave. He looked in and saw the image sitting there, and it was trying  to put together the old broken things that had been cast in as of no  value.    Chemanitou gathered together a vast heap of stones and sand, for large  rocks are not to be had upon the island, and stopped the mouth of the  cave. Many days passed and the noise within the cave grew louder. The  earth shook, and hot smoke came from the ground. The manitoes crowded  to Metowac to see what was the matter.    Chemanitou came also, for he remembered the image he had cast in there  of which he had forgotten to take away the life.    Suddenly there was a great rising of the stones and sand, the sky grew  black with wind and dust. Fire played about on the ground, and water  gushed high into the air.    All the manitoes fled with fear, and the image came forth with a great  noise and most terrible to behold. Its life had grown strong within  it, for the fire had made it very fierce.    Everything fled before it and cried--    \"Machinitou! machinitou,\" which means a god, but an evil god.          THE WOMAN OF STONE.      In one of the niches or recesses formed by a precipice in the cavern  of Kickapoo Creek, which is a tributary of the Wisconsin, there is a  gigantic mass of stone presenting the appearance of a human figure. It  is so sheltered by the overhanging rocks and by the sides of the  recess in which it stands as to assume a dark and gloomy character. Of  the figure the following legend is related:--    Once upon a time there lived a woman who was called Shenanska, or the  White Buffalo Robe. She was an inhabitant of the prairie, a dweller in  the cabins which stand upon the verge of the hills. She was the pride  of her people, not only for her beauty, which was very great, but for  her goodness. The breath of the summer wind was not milder than the  temper of Shenanska, the face of the sun was not fairer than her  countenance.    At length the tribe was surprised in its encampment on the banks of  the Kickapoo by a numerous band of the fierce Mengwe. Many of them  fell fighting bravely, the greater part of the women and children were  made prisoners, and the others fled to the wilds for safety. It was  the fortune of Shenanska to escape from death or captivity. When the  alarm of the war-whoop reached her ear as she was sleeping in her  lodge with her husband, she had rushed forth with him and gone with  the braves to meet their assailants. When she saw half of the men of  her nation lying dead around, then she fled. She had been wounded in  the battle, but she still succeeded in effecting her escape to the  hills. Weakened by loss of blood, she had not strength enough left to  hunt for a supply of food, and she was near perishing with hunger.    While she lay beneath the shade of a tree there came to her a being  not of this world.    \"Shenanska,\" said he, in a gentle voice, \"thou art wounded and hungry,  shall I heal thee and feed thee? Wilt thou return to the lands of thy  tribe and live to be old, a widow and alone, or go now to the land of  departed spirits and join the shade of thy husband? The choice is  thine. If thou wilt live, crippled, and bowed down by wounds and  disease, thou mayest. If it would please thee better to rejoin thy  friends in the country beyond the Great River, say so.\"    Shenanska replied that she wished to die. The spirit took her, and  placed her in one of the recesses of the cavern, overshadowed by  hanging rocks. He then spoke some words in a low voice, and, breathing  on her, she became stone. Determined that a woman so good and  beautiful should not be forgotten by the world, he made her into a  statue, to which he gave the power of killing suddenly any one who  irreverently approached it. For a long time the statue relentlessly  exercised this power. Many an unconscious Indian, venturing too near  to it, fell dead without any perceptible wound. At length, tired of  the havoc the statue made, the guardian spirit took away the power he  had given to it. At this day the statue may be approached with safety,  but the Indians hold it in fear, not intruding rashly upon it, and  when in its presence treating it with great respect.          THE"]]]
