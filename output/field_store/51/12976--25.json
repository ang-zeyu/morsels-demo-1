In  the evening, when about to put her threat into execution, she found the  little dog established in a corner of the room, and the large one  standing before it. Endeavouring to fulfil her intention by first  driving off the large dog, he gave her plainly to understand that he was  not at all disposed to relinquish his post. She then sought to get at  the small dog behind the other, but the threatening gesture, and fiercer  growl of the large one, sufficiently indicated that the attempt would be  not a little perilous. The result was that she was obliged to abandon  her design. In killing the cock I can scarcely think that the dog  understood the precise import of my stepmother's wish, as his immediate  execution of it would seem to imply. The cock was a more recent  favourite, and had received some attentions which had previously been  bestowed upon himself. This, I think, had led him to entertain a feeling  of hostility to the bird, which he did not presume to indulge, until my  mother's tone and manner indicated that the cock was no longer under her  protection. In the power of communicating with each other, which these  dogs evidently possess, and which, in some instances, has been displayed  by other species of animals, a faculty seems to be developed of which we  know very little. On the whole, I never remember to have met with a case  in which to human appearance there was a nearer approach to moral  perception than in that of my father's two dogs.\"      THE DIFFERENCE OF EXCHANGE.--\"DOG-CHEAP.\"    Dining at a nobleman's table, where the company were praising the  claret, his lordship told them that he had received that hogshead of  wine in return for a couple of hounds, which he sometime before  presented to Count Lauragais. \"Why, then, my lord,\" cried Foote, \"I not  only think your wine excellent, but _dog-cheap_.\"[66]      GAINSBOROUGH AND HIS WIFE AND THEIR DOGS.    Thomas Gainsborough, the rival of Sir Joshua in portraiture, wanted that  evenness of temper which the President of the Royal Academy so  abundantly possessed. He was easily angered, but as soon appeased, and  says his biographer,[67] \"If he was the first to offend, he was the  first to atone. Whenever he spoke crossly to his wife, a remarkably  sweet-tempered woman, he would write a note of repentance, sign it with  the name of his favourite dog 'Fox,' and address it to his Margaret's  pet spaniel, 'Tristram.' Fox would take the note in his mouth, and duly  deliver it to Tristram. Margaret would then answer--'My own dear Fox,  you are always loving and good, and I am a naughty little female ever to  worry you, as I too often do, so we will kiss and say no more about it;  your own affectionate Tris.'\" The writers of such a correspondence could  not have led what is called \"a cat and dog life.\" Husbands and wives  might derive a hint from this anecdote; for we know, from the old  ballad, that they will be sulky and quarrel at times even about getting       \"Up to bar the door, O!\"      SIR WILLIAM GELL'S DOG.    The reviewer[68] of Sir Thomas Browne's works says--\"We ourselves have  witnessed an example of the curious and credulous exaggeration which has  construed certain articulations in animals into rational speech. Some  time since, in travelling through Italy, we heard, in grave earnest,  from several Italians, of the prodigy of a Pomeranian dog that had been  taught to speak most intelligibly by Sir William Gell. Afterwards, in  visiting that accomplished and lamented gentleman at Naples, we  requested to hear an animal possessed of so unusual a gift. And, as the  friends of the urban scholar can bear witness, the dog undoubtedly could  utter a howl, which, assisted by the hand of the master in closing the  jaw at certain inflections, might be intelligibly construed into two  words not to be repeated. Such a dog, with such an anathema in his  vocabulary, would have hanged any witch in England three centuries ago.\"      ELIZABETH, THE LAST DUCHESS OF GORDON, AND THE WOLF-DOG KAISER.    The Rev. A. Moody Stuart, in his \"Life of the last Duchess of  Gordon,\"[69] that truly Christian lady, refers to some old pets of the  duke's and her own, which, on her becoming a widow, she took with her  from Gordon Castle to Huntly Lodge, a bullfinch, an immense Talbot  mastiff named Sall, and others. He adds--\"To a stranger, the most  remarkable of the duke's old favourites was Kaiser, an Hungarian  wolf-dog, with a snow-white fleece, and most sheep-like aspect in the  distance, but at whose appearance out of doors, man, woman, and child  fled as from a wolf. The duchess called him 'The wolf in sheep's  clothing.' Her husband's tastes having brought her much into contact  with all sorts of dogs, she had learned to pat them confidently at their  first introduction, when a large space between their eyes betokened a  kindly temper. This open breadth of forehead was strongly marked in  Sall, a fine old mastiff that used at this time to walk round the  dining-room after breakfast, with her noble head reaching the level of  the table. But the duke had chosen Kaiser for other qualities. Two of  those wolf-dogs had been brought to him for sale when travelling on the  Continent; the other was the larger and handsomer animal; but Kaiser's  eyes, sunk deep in the head, and all but meeting under his shaggy hair,  at once fixed his choice on him as 'likest his work.' That work was to  defend the sheep from the wolves, and one mode of defence was by laying  a strange trap for the enemy. The dog was remarkably like a sheep, his  hair white without a dark speck, and he carried a great load of it, long  and fleecy like wool. In the Hungarian steppes four or five of those  dogs would lay themselves down on the grass in the evening, sleeping  there like so many harmless lambs, with their faces inward for the heat  of each other's breath. The keen eye of the wolf was soon attracted by  the white fleeces, with no shepherd near to guard them. Eager for blood,  he careered swiftly over the plain, and sprang unsuspecting into the  midst of the flock, only to find himself clenched in the relentless jaws  of Kaiser and his comrades, wolves more terrible than himself under the  clothing of timid sheep. A conversation once took place at the Lodge on  the character ascribed to dogs in Scripture. It slightly vexed the good  duchess that they were so often mentioned in the Bible, but only as  emblems of what is foul and fierce, except in a single instance, and  that not of commendation, but neutrality. This exception, she said,  occurred in the Book of Proverbs, where the greyhound is named, along  with the lion and the goat, as 'comely in going,' yet merely in praise  of his external beauty. But her difficulty was relieved by the reply,  that in Isaiah lvi. 10, the \"dog\" is really used in a good sense as  applied to the spiritual watchmen of the Lord's flock. For the  unfaithful shepherds, being there likened to dumb dogs that cannot bark,  were not censured under the simple image of watch-dogs, but because, as  such, they were faithless and useless; implying that the good watch-dog  is an honourable emblem of the true pastor, watching for the souls  committed to his care, and solemnly warning them of approaching danger.\"      FREDERICK THE GREAT AND HIS ITALIAN GREYHOUNDS.    Dr John Moore, when travelling with the Duke of Hamilton, saw and heard  a good deal of Frederick the Great, and has given in his second volume  of \"A View of Society and Manners in France,\" &c., many interesting  particulars of his private and public life. Among these, he alludes to  his using \"a very large gold snuff-box, the lid ornamented with  diamonds,\" and his taking \"an immoderate quantity of Spanish snuff, the  marks of which very often appear on his waistcoat and breeches. These  are also liable to be soiled by the paws of two or three Italian  greyhounds, which he often caresses\" (vol. ii. p. 236).      THE DOG AND THE FRENCH MURDERERS. (AN OCCURRENCE IN THE SPRING OF 1837.)    Thomas Raikes,[70] in his Journal 8th March 1837, records:--\"Eight years  ago, a labouring man in the department of the Loire was found murdered  in a wood near his house, and his dog sitting near the body. No clue  could be gained to the perpetrators of the crime, and his widow  continued to live in the same cottage, accompanied always by the  faithful animal. Last week two men, apparently travellers, stopped at  the house, requesting shelter from the storm, which was granted; but no  sooner had the dog perceived them, than he flew at them with fury, and  could not be pacified. As they were quitting the house, one of them said  to the other, 'That rascally dog has not forgotten us.' This raised the  suspicion of the widow, who overheard it, and applying to the gendarmes  in the neighbourhood, they followed and arrested them. The result has  been that, after a long examination, one of them has confessed the  crime, and impeached his associate.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Hannah More wrote an ode addressed to Garrick's famous house-dog Dragon.  A copy of this she gave to Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1777, while still  unprinted, under an oath neither to take nor give a copy of it, which  oath Sir Joshua had observed (she says) like a true knight, only reading  it to his visitors till some of them learned it by heart. The \"charming  bagatelle\" was afterwards printed, that posterity might be enabled to  wonder what a small expenditure of wit in metre sufficed to purchase a  large modicum of fame among the blues of that day.[71]      ROBERT HALL AND THE DOG.

They  were able to dip into the swift, white currents and wrestle with them  without being washed away. Of course, the water would sometimes carry  them down stream, but never more than a few inches, and never to a point  where they could be injured. They were perfect masters of the situation.  They simply slipped in and out like living chunks of cork. Their coats  were waterproof, all they needed to do being to shake off the crystal  drops now and then.    Their flight up the almost perpendicular face of the falls was one of  graceful celerity. Up, up, they would mount only a few inches from the  dashing current, and disappear upstream in search of food. In returning,  they would sweep down over the precipitous falls with the swiftness of  arrows, stopping themselves lightly with their outspread wings before  reaching the rocks below. From a human point of view it was a frightful  plunge; from the ousel point of view it was an every-day affair.    [Illustration: _Water-Ousel_    \"_Up, up, only a few inches from the dashing current_\"]    After watching the tussle between ousel and water for a long time, I  decided to take a peep at their nursery. In order to do this I was  compelled to wade into the stream a little below the falls, through mist  and spray; yet such humid quarters were the natural habitat and  playground of these interesting cinclids. And there the nest was, set in  a cleft about a foot and a half above the water, its outer walls kept  moist by the spray which constantly dashed against them from the falls.  The water was also dripping from the rock that over-hung the nest and  formed its roof. A damp, uncanny place for a bird's domicile, you would  naturally suppose, but the little lovers of cascades knew what they were  about. Only the exterior of the thick, moss-covered walls were moist.  Within, the nest was dry and cosey. It was an oval structure, set in its  rocky cleft like a small oven, with an opening at the front. And there  in the doorway cuddled the two fledglings, looking out at the dripping  walls and the watery tumult, but kept warm and comfortable. I could not  resist touching them and caressing their little heads, considering it  quite an ornithological triumph for one day to find a pair of  water-ousels, discover a nest, and place my finger upon the crowns of  the nestlings.    Scores of tourists visited the famous falls every day, some of them  lingering long in the beautiful place, and yet the little ousels had  gone on with their nest-building and brood-rearing, undisturbed by human  spectators. I wondered whether many of the visitors noticed the birds,  and whether any one but myself had discovered their nest. Indeed, their  little ones were safe enough from human meddling, for one could not see  the nest without wading up the stream into the sphere of the flying  mists.    The natural home of _Cinclus mexicanus_ is the Rocky Mountains, to which  he is restricted, not being known anywhere else on this continent. He is  the only member of the dipper family in North America. There is one  species in South America, and another in Europe. He loves the mountain  stream, with its dashing rapids and cascades. Indeed, he will erect his  oven-like cottage nowhere else, and it must be a fall and not a mere  ripple or rapid. Then from this point as a centre--or, rather, the  middle point of a wavering line--he forages up and down the babbling,  meandering brook, feeding chiefly, if not wholly, on water insects.  Strange to say, he never leaves the streams, never makes excursions to  the country roundabout, never flies over a mountain ridge or divide to  reach another valley, but simply pursues the winding streams with a  fidelity that deserves praise for its very singleness of purpose. No  \"landlubber\" he. It is said by one writer that the dipper has never been  known to alight on a tree, preferring a rock or a piece of driftwood  beside the babbling stream; yet he has the digits and claws of the  passeres, among which he is placed systematically. He is indeed an  anomaly, though a very engaging one. Should he wish to go to another  canyon, he will simply follow the devious stream he is on to its junction  with the stream of the other valley; then up the second defile. His  flight is exceedingly swift. His song is a loud, clear, cheerful strain,  the very quintessence of gladness as it mingles with the roar of the  cataracts.    Farther up Ute Pass I found another nest, which was placed right back  of a cascade, so that the birds had to dash through a curtain of spray  to reach their cot. They also were feeding their young, and I could see  them standing on a rock beneath the shelf, tilting their bodies and  scanning me narrowly before diving into the cleft where the nest was  hidden. This nest, being placed back of the falls, could not be reached.    In Bear Creek canyon I discovered another inaccessible nest, which was  placed in a fissure at the very foot of the falls and only an inch or  two above the agitated waters. There must have been a cavity running  back into the rock, else the nest would have been kept in a soggy  condition all the time.    Perhaps the most interesting dipper's nest I found was one at the  celebrated Seven Falls in the south Cheyenne Canyon. On the face of the  cliff by the side of the lowest fall there was a cleft, in which the  nest was placed, looking like a large bunch of moss and grass. My glass  brought the structure so near that I could plainly see three little  heads protruding from the doorway. There were a dozen or more people  about the falls at the time, who made no attempt at being quiet, and yet  the parent birds flew fearlessly up to the nest with tidbits in their  bills, and were greeted with loud, impatient cries from three hungry  mouths, which were opened wide to receive the food. The total plunge of  the stream over the Seven Falls is hundreds of feet, and yet the adult  birds would toss themselves over the abyss with reckless abandon, stop  themselves without apparent effort in front of their cleft, and thrust  the gathered morsels into the little yellow-lined mouths. It was an  aerial feat that made our heads dizzy. This pair of birds did not fly up  the face of the falls in ascending to the top, as did those at Rainbow  Falls, but clambered up the wall of the cliff close to the side of the  roaring cataract, aiding themselves with both claws and wings. When  gathering food below the falls, they would usually, in going or  returning, fly in a graceful curve over the heads of their human  visitors.    [Illustration: _Water-Ousel_    \"_Three hungry mouths, which were opened wide to receive the food_\"]    Although the dipper is not a web-footed bird, and is not classed by the  naturalists among the aquatic fowl, but is, indeed, a genuine passerine,  yet he can swim quite dexterously on the surface of the water. However,  his greatest strength and skill are shown in swimming under water, where  he propels himself with his wings, often to a considerable distance,  either with or against the current. Sometimes he will allow the current  to carry him a short distance down the stream, but he is always able to  stop himself at a chosen point. \"Ever and anon,\" says Mr. John Muir, in  his attractive book on \"The Mountains of California,\" \"while searching  for food in the rushing stream, he sidles out to where the too powerful  current carries him off his feet; then he dexterously rises on the wing  and goes gleaning again in shallower places.\" So it seems that our  little acrobat is equal to every emergency that may arise in his  adventurous life.    In winter, when the rushing mountain streams are flowing with the sludge  of the half-melted snow, so that he cannot see the bottom, where most of  his delicacies lie, he betakes himself to the quieter stretches of the  rivers, or to the mill ponds or mountain lakes, where he finds clearer  and smoother water, although a little deeper than he usually selects.  Such weather does not find him at the end of his resources; no, indeed!  Having betaken himself to a lake, he does not at once plunge into its  depths after the manner of a duck, but finding a perch on a snag or a  fallen pine, he sits there a moment, and then, flying out thirty or  forty yards, \"he alights with a dainty glint on the surface, swims  about, looks down, finally makes up his mind, and disappears with a  sharp stroke of his wings.\" So says Mr. John Muir, who continues: \"After  feeding for two or three minutes he suddenly reappears, showers the  water from his wings with one vigorous shake, and rises abruptly into  the air as if pushed up from beneath, comes back to his perch, sings a  few minutes, and goes out to dive again; thus coming and going, singing  and diving, at the same place for hours.\"    The depths to which the cinclid dives for the food on the bottom is  often from fifteen to twenty feet. When he selects a river instead of a  lake for his winter bathing, its waters, like those of the shallower  streams, may also contain a large quantity of sludge, thus rendering  them opaque even to the sharp little eyes of the dipper. Then what does  he do? He has a very natural and cunning way of solving this problem; he  simply seeks a deep portion of the river and dives through the turbid  water to the clear water beneath, where he can plainly see the \"goodies\"  on the bottom.    It must not be thought that this little bird is mute amid all the watery  tumult of his mountain home, for he is a rare vocalist, his song  mingling with the ripple and gurgle and roar of the streams that he  haunts. Nor does he sing only in the springtime, but all the year round,  on stormy days as well as fair. During Indian summer, when the streams  are small, and silence broods over many a mountain solitude, the song of  the ousel falls to its lowest ebb; but when winter comes and the streams  are converted into rolling"]]]
