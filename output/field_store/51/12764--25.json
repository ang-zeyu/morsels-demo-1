[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#19)"],[1," pueblo built to the  defensive inclosed court containing the ceremonial chamber. The plan  strongly indicates that the other courts of the pueblo were added as the  village grew, each added row facing toward the back of an older row,  producing a series of courts, which, to the present time, show more  terracing on their western sides. The eastern side of each court is  formed, apparently, by a few additions of low rooms to what was  originally an unbroken exterior wall, and which is still clearly  traceable through these added rooms. Such an exterior wall is  illustrated in Pl. XVIII. This process continued until the last cluster  nearly filled the available site and a wing was thrown out corresponding  to a tongue or spur of the knoll upon which it was built. Naturally the  westernmost or newer portions show more clearly the evidence of  additions and changes, but such evidence is not wholly wanting in the  older portions. The large row that bounds the original eastern court on  the west side may be seen on the plan to be of unusual width, having the  largest number of rooms that form a terrace with western aspect; yet the  nearly straight line once defining the original back wall of the court  inclosing cluster on this side has not been obscured to any great extent  by the later additions (Pl. XXVIII). This village furnishes the most  striking example in the whole group of the manner in which a pueblo was  gradually enlarged as increasing population demanded more space. Such  additions were often carried out on a definite plan, although the  results in Tusayan fall far short of the symmetry that characterizes  many ruined pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona.      [Illustration: Fig. 11. Diagram showing growth of Mashongnavi.]      [Illustration: Fig. 12. Diagram showing growth of Mashongnavi.]      [Illustration: Plate XXIX. West side of a principal row in    Mashongnavi.]    A few of these ancient examples, especially some of the smaller ruins of  the Chaco group, are so symmetrical in their arrangement that they seem  to be the result of a single effort to carry out a clearly fixed plan.  By far the largest number of pueblos, however, built among the southwest  tablelands, if occupied for any length of time, must have been subject  to irregular enlargement. In some ancient examples, such additions to  the first plan undoubtedly took place without marring the general  symmetry. This was the case at Pueblo Bonito, on the Chaco, where the  symmetrical and even curve of the exterior defensive wall, which was at  least four stories high, remained unbroken, while the large inclosed  court was encroached upon by wings added to the inner terraces. These  additions comfortably provided for a very large increase of population  after the first building of the pueblo, without changing its exterior  appearance.    In order to make clearer this order of growth in Mashongnavi, a series  of skeleton diagrams is added in Figs. 10, 11, and 12, giving the  outlines of the pueblo at various supposed periods in the course of its  enlargement. The larger plan of the village (Pl. XXVI) serves as a key  to these terrace outlines.    The first diagram illustrates the supposed original cluster of the east  court (Fig. 10), the lines of which can be traced on the larger plan,  and it includes the long, nearly straight line that marks the western  edge of the third story. This diagram shows also, in dotted lines, the  general plan that may have guided the first additions to the west. The  second diagram (Fig. 11) renders all the above material in full tint,  again indicating further additions by dotted lines, and so on. (Fig.  12.) The portions of a terrace, which face westward in the newer courts  of the pueblo, illustrated in Pl. XXIX, were probably built after the  western row, completing the inclosure, and were far enough advanced to  indicate definitely an inclosed court, upon which the dwelling rooms  faced.      [Illustration: Plate XXX. Plan of Shupaulovi.]    SHUPAULOVI.    This village, by far the smallest pueblo of the Tusayan group,  illustrates a simple and direct use of the principle of the inclosed  court. The plan (Pl. XXX) shows that the outer walls are scarcely broken  by terraces, and nearly all the dwelling apartments open inwards upon  the inclosure, in this respect closely following the previously  described ancient type, although widely differing from it in the  irregular disposition of the rooms. (Pl. XXXI) A comparison with the  first of the series of diagrams illustrating the growth of Mashóngnavi,  will show how similar the villages may have been at one stage, and how  suitable a nucleus for a large pueblo this village would prove did space  and character of the site permit. Most of the available summit of the  rocky knoll has already been covered, as will be seen from the  topographic sketch of the site (Fig. 13). The plan shows also that some  efforts at extension of the pueblo have been made, but the houses  outside of the main cluster have been abandoned, and are rapidly going  to ruin. Several small rooms occur on the outer faces of the rows, but  it can be readily seen that they do not form a part of the original plan  but were added to an already complete structure.      [Illustration: Fig. 13. Topography of the site of Shupaulovi.]    In the inclosed court of this pueblo occurs a small box-like stone  inclosure, covered with a large slab, which is used as a sort of shrine  or depository for the sacred plume sticks and other ceremonial  offerings. This feature is found at some of the other villages, notably  at Mashongnavi, in the central court, and at Hano, where it is located  at some distance outside of the village, near the main trail to the  mesa.    The plan of this small village shows three covered passageways similar  to those noted in Walpi on the first mesa, though their presence here  can not be ascribed to the same motives that impelled the Walpi to build  in this way; for the densely crowded site occupied by the latter  compelled them to resort to this expedient. One of these is illustrated  in Pl. XXXII. Its presence may be due in this instance to a  determination to adhere to the protected court while seeking to secure  convenient means of access to the inclosed area. It is remarkable that  this, the smallest of the group, should contain this feature.    This village has but two kivas, one of which is on the rocky summit near  the houses and the other on the lower ground near the foot of the trail  that leads to the village. The upper kiva is nearly subterranean, the  roof being but a little above the ground on the side toward the village,  but as the rocky site slopes away a portion of side wall is exposed.  This was roughly built, with no attempt to impart finish to its outer  face, either by careful laying of the masonry or by plastering. Pl.  XXXIII illustrates this kiva in connection with the southeastern portion  of the village. The plan shows how the prolongation of the side rows of  the village forms a suggestion of a second court. Its development into  any such feature as the secondary or additional courts of Mashóngnavi  was prohibited by the restricted site.    As in other villages of this group, the desire to adhere to the  subterranean form of ceremonial chamber outweighed the inducement to  place it within the village, or, in the case of the second kiva, even of  placing it on the same level as the houses, which are 30 feet above it  with an abrupt trail between them. It is curious and instructive to see  a room, the use of which is so intimately connected with the inner life  of the village, placed in such a comparatively remote and inaccessible  position through an intensely conservative adherence to ancient practice  requiring this chamber to be depressed.      [Illustration: Plate XXXI. View of Shupaulovi.]    The general view of the village given in Pl. XXXI strikingly illustrates  the blending of the rectangular forms of the architecture with the  angular and sharply defined fractures of the surrounding rock. This  close correspondence in form between the architecture and its immediate  surroundings is greatly heightened by the similarity in color. Mr.  Stephen has called attention to a similar effect on the western side of  Walpi and its adjacent mesa edge, which he thought indicates a distinct  effort at concealment on the part of the builders, by blending the  architecture with the surroundings. This similarity of effect is often  accidental, and due to the fact that the materials of the houses and of  the mesas on which they are built are identical. Even in the case of  Walpi, cited by Mr. Stephen, where the buildings come to the very mesa  edge, and in their vertical lines appear to carry out the effect of the  vertical fissures in the upper benches of sandstone, there was no  intentional concealment. It is more likely that, through the necessity  of building close to the limits of the crowded sites, a certain degree  of correspondence was unintentionally produced between the jogs and  angles of the houses and those of the mesa edge.    Such correspondence with the surroundings, which forms a striking  feature of many primitive types of construction where intention of  concealment had no part, is doubtless mainly due to the use of the most  available material, although the expression of a type of construction  that has prevailed for ages in one locality would perhaps be somewhat  influenced by constantly recurring forms in its environment. In the  system of building under consideration, such influence would, however,  be a very minute fraction in the sum of factors producing the type and  could never account for such examples of special and detailed  correspondence as the cases cited, nor could it have any weight in  developing a rectangular type of architecture.    In the development of primitive arts the advances are slow and  laborious, and are produced by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#19)"],[1,", the draperies good, and the  colouring skilful.    [29] See F. Culemann in _Neue hannov. Zeitung_, 1861, Nos. 22-4.    One of the many characteristic MSS. of this period to be seen in  continental libraries is the \"Mater Verborum\" of the monk Conrad, of  Scheyern in Bavaria, a noted scribe, illuminator, goldsmith, and  grammarian. The subject is one that scarcely gives promise of lending  itself to pictorial illustration, but after the successful attempts of  Theodulf we may be prepared for anything in the way of diagram and  symbol. Imagine a dictionary in which not only actual objects are  pictorially represented, but also abstract terms. Music, philosophy,  virtues and vices illustrated by historical instances--sacred subjects  treated in the manner of the glass painters which is so commonly found  in German and French work of this period.    Of twelfth-century illumination in general it may be said that it shows  a marked effort towards true artistic design and subtle beauty of linear  outline. Some of the noblest curve-drawing, with rich and massive  grouping of foliages, is to be found in the ornamental initials and  dignified border designs presented on the later examples of the century,  and it is very interesting to observe the rapid pace at which the climax  is reached in mere calligraphic ornament after the opening of the Gothic  period. Initials become smaller but exquisitely drawn, and reasonable  expression takes the place of the senseless stare or grotesque  exaggeration of attitude and feature which detract from the artistic  value of all preceding efforts. To conclude our list of German  illuminations of purely monastic production, we will bring forward one  more example of women's work, which whether as regards its curious  illustrations of symbolism, or its richly foliaged geometrical  backgrounds and borders, is one of the most interesting MSS. in any  collection. It is the Evangeliary of the Abbess Uota, or perhaps,  rather, Tuota of Niedermünster, a lady of the House of the Counts of  Falckenstein (1177-80); or of Utta, abbess from 1009 to 1012, but more  probably the former. Another, Tutta, ruled the abbey from 920 to 934,  and still another 1239-42. This precious MS., which Cahier has very  fully described as the \"Manuscrit du Niedermuenster de Ratisbonne,\" is  now in the Royal Library at Munich (Cimel. 35). Some writers, in  speaking of it, have classed it among the MSS. of the eleventh century,  but it is too refined and too well done for that period, and, indeed,  that it belongs to the _latter part_ of the twelfth is almost proved  from the work itself. Perhaps it was the profusion of inscriptions or  legends placed all over the miniatures that gave the idea of its  belonging to the eleventh century. In this respect the MS. certainly  resembles the Evangeliary of Luxeuil already described. The miniature of  the Crucifixion is very remarkable. Besides the figure of Christ showing  a return to the primitive Syriac idea,[30] instead of the figures as  usual of Mary and John, here are given allegorical figures _of_ Life and  Death. (Cf. Fest. in exaltatione sce crucis. Ad Laudes, 14th Sept.).  Perhaps the best commentary on these old figures is the \"Biblia  Pauperum,\" as it is commonly called, or as it should be called, the  Bible of the poor preachers. It also has the old allegories and  inscriptions rendered into later forms.    [30] Cf. the Rabula MS. at Vienna.    As for the texts or inscriptions, they would require a commentary to  themselves--not to speak of translations and remarks upon the  calligraphy. One of these remarkable miniatures may be described, as it  depicts the presentation of the volume to the Madonna. Our Lady in the  centre of the design is seated on a Byzantine _sedile_ with the infant  Jesus on her knees. She is crowned, and has the nimbus, and appears as  if intended to represent the glory of the Church. Her hand is raised as  in the act of teaching. Christ, also, has the nimbus, but with the cross  upon it, and raises his hand in the attitude of benediction. In the  tympanum of the semicircle over the Madonna, written in letters of gold  on purple, surrounded by the word \"Sancta\" in ordinary ink, is the  monogram of Maria, having a small sun and moon above it, and other  inscriptions, partly Latin, partly Greek. Below the Madonna, on the  left, stands the abbess, her knees slightly bent, holding up her book,  and clothed in the costume of her Order, but coloured, no doubt, simply  for artistic reasons. Thus she wears a blue veil and a claret-coloured  robe. In the reversed semicircle before her is another monogram, Uota or  Tuota, a name which perhaps may be translated Uta, Utta, Ida, etc. It  has been said already who she is likely to have been. It does not  follow, of course, that she herself wrote or illuminated the book she is  presenting, but judging from similar instances, as _e.g._ Herrade of  Landsberg and Hrosvita of Gandersheim, she may have done so.    Still the work looks technically too masterly for anyone not a trained  artist to have done. In the corners are small quadretti, containing  busts of the four cardinal virtues:--Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and  Fortitude; and in circlets in the centre of each border are Faith, Hope,  and Charity, the latter twice, at top and bottom. A number of  extraordinary beasts fill up little niches in the design, which may  possibly be also symbolical, but possibly also nothing but artistic  fancies. The other miniatures we must pass over. Nevertheless those  representing the four evangelists are worth examination;[31] the  ornamentation being especially rich and elaborate. Let us now turn our  attention to a new element--a new spirit we might term it--which was  manifesting itself in Italy and France. We cannot too strongly insist  upon the fact that whatever appears in illumination has appeared first  in architecture and its auxilliary arts. Now we have to see how this  fact begins to change almost entirely the character of the ornamentation  of books. During the latter part of the twelfth century, when precisely  we cannot say, nor where, a new form of architecture began to show  itself. This new style, laying aside both the classic cornice and the  Romanesque arch, makes use of a new vertical principle of construction,  called in French the _ogive_ or arch, composed of two sections only,  instead of the whole semicircle. By some fatality, of which no exact  explanation can be given, English writers have given this new style the  name of Gothic. Scores of cathedrals throughout Europe are called Gothic  cathedrals, whereas in all probability, if we exclude Sweden, there is  only one really Gothic building in the world, that is the Tomb of  Theodoric at Ravenna, and none of the so-called Gothic cathedrals are in  the least like it. As to the invention itself, it has been claimed by  almost every nationality in Europe. There can be no doubt that  accidentally, or otherwise, the pointed arch had been used often enough  without any idea of its adoption as a principle of construction even in  ancient buildings. The famous gate at Mycoene is one instance. This is  not the place to discuss the question, so we let it pass. We could point  out long and elaborate arguments intended to prove that it originated in  England--that it originated in France--in Germany.[32] Possibly they may  all be right in a sense, for most probably the origin was not in any  particular locality, but in the religious spirit of the time. It was a  general revival of the Church itself that was its cause. If any special  locality has more reason on its side than another, it is probably  France, but as we say, that is not an essential point. It must suffice  us here that it arose, and that by the end of the twelfth century it was  a fact. And the remarkable part about it is that it was by the influence  of lay artists and especially of the freemasons that it became the  accepted architecture of Christendom.    [31] For more about them, see Cahier, _Mélanges d'Archéologie, etc._    [32] Not to mention _theories_, which are endless.

We have now reached the parting of the ways. The study of Nature is fast  superseding the dogmas of the monastic code, and what some writers have  characterised as the hieratic is giving way to the naturalistic  treatment of art. Like the pointed architecture itself, it is an outcome  of the spirit of the age. Exactly when it begins we cannot say. As in  the physical sciences, our limits are necessarily somewhat arbitrary to  suit our convenience in classification. We take the beginning of the  thirteenth century as a convenient dividing line between old and new. We  accept it as the boundary between the artistic sway of the East and  South--and that of the West and North--between the lifeless fetters of  prescription and the living freedom of invention. The contrast between  the two is very strongly marked. The soft and curling foliages of the  sunny South are for a season giving way to the hard and thorny leafage  of the wintry North. It would seem as if pointed architecture began with  the hard and frozen winter of its existence, and if it had been the plan  or design of one individual we might"]]]
