and he  saw that, in a sense, the whole world is but a great ceremony or  sacrament, which teaches under visible forms a hidden and transcendent  doctrine. It was thus that he found in the ritual of the church a  perfect image of the world; an image purged, exalted, and illuminate, a  holy house built up of shining and translucent stones, in which the  burning torches were more significant than the wheeling stars, and the  fuming incense was a more certain token than the rising of the mist. His  soul went forth with the albed procession in its white and solemn order,  the mystic dance that signifies rapture and a joy above all joys, and  when he beheld Love slain and rise again victorious he knew that he  witnessed, in a figure, the consummation of all things, the Bridal of  all Bridals, the mystery that is beyond all mysteries, accomplished from  the foundation of the world. So day by day the house of his life became  more magical.    And at the same time he began to guess that if in the New Life there are  new and unheard-of joys, there are also new and unheard-of dangers. In  his manuscript books which professed to deliver the outer sense of those  mysterious 'Hidden Songs of Iolo Sant' there was a little chapter that  bore the heading: _Fons Sacer non in communem Vsum convertendus est_,  and by diligence, with much use of the grammar and dictionary, Darnell  was able to construe the by no means complex Latin of his ancestor. The  special book which contained the chapter in question was one of the most  singular in the collection, since it bore the title _Terra de Iolo_, and  on the surface, with an ingenious concealment of its real symbolism, it  affected to give an account of the orchards, fields, woods, roads,  tenements, and waterways in the possession of Darnell's ancestors. Here,  then, he read of the Holy Well, hidden in the Wistman's Wood--_Sylva  Sapientum_--'a fountain of abundant water, which no heats of summer can  ever dry, which no flood can ever defile, which is as a water of life,  to them that thirst for life, a stream of cleansing to them that would  be pure, and a medicine of such healing virtue that by it, through the  might of God and the intercession of His saints, the most grievous  wounds are made whole.' But the water of this well was to be kept  sacred perpetually, it was not to be used for any common purpose, nor to  satisfy any bodily thirst; but ever to be esteemed as holy, 'even as the  water which the priest hath hallowed.' And in the margin a comment in a  later hand taught Darnell something of the meaning of these  prohibitions. He was warned not to use the Well of Life as a mere luxury  of mortal life, as a new sensation, as a means of making the insipid cup  of everyday existence more palatable. 'For,' said the commentator, 'we  are not called to sit as the spectators in a theatre, there to watch the  play performed before us, but we are rather summoned to stand in the  very scene itself, and there fervently to enact our parts in a great and  wonderful mystery.'    Darnell could quite understand the temptation that was thus indicated.  Though he had gone but a little way on the path, and had barely tested  the over-runnings of that mystic well, he was already aware of the  enchantment that was transmuting all the world about him, informing his  life with a strange significance and romance. London seemed a city of  the Arabian Nights, and its labyrinths of streets an enchanted maze; its  long avenues of lighted lamps were as starry systems, and its immensity  became for him an image of the endless universe. He could well imagine  how pleasant it might be to linger in such a world as this, to sit apart  and dream, beholding the strange pageant played before him; but the  Sacred Well was not for common use, it was for the cleansing of the  soul, and the healing of the grievous wounds of the spirit. There must  be yet another transformation: London had become Bagdad; it must at  last be transmuted to Syon, or in the phrase of one of his old  documents, the City of the Cup.    And there were yet darker perils which the Iolo MSS. (as his father had  named the collection) hinted at more or less obscurely. There were  suggestions of an awful region which the soul might enter, of a  transmutation that was unto death, of evocations which could summon the  utmost forces of evil from their dark places--in a word, of that sphere  which is represented to most of us under the crude and somewhat childish  symbolism of Black Magic. And here again he was not altogether without a  dim comprehension of what was meant. He found himself recalling an odd  incident that had happened long ago, which had remained all the years in  his mind unheeded, amongst the many insignificant recollections of his  childhood, and now rose before him, clear and distinct and full of  meaning. It was on that memorable visit to the old house in the west,  and the whole scene returned, with its smallest events, and the voices  seemed to sound in his ears. It was a grey, still day of heavy heat that  he remembered: he had stood on the lawn after breakfast, and wondered at  the great peace and silence of the world. Not a leaf stirred in the  trees on the lawn, not a whisper came from the myriad leaves of the  wood; the flowers gave out sweet and heavy odours as if they breathed  the dreams of the summer night; and far down the valley, the winding  river was like dim silver under that dim and silvery sky, and the far  hills and woods and fields vanished in the mist. The stillness of the  air held him as with a charm; he leant all the morning against the rails  that parted the lawn from the meadow, breathing the mystic breath of  summer, and watching the fields brighten as with a sudden blossoming of  shining flowers as the high mist grew thin for a moment before the  hidden sun. As he watched thus, a man weary with heat, with some glance  of horror in his eyes, passed him on his way to the house; but he stayed  at his post till the old bell in the turret rang, and they dined all  together, masters and servants, in the dark cool room that looked  towards the still leaves of the wood. He could see that his uncle was  upset about something, and when they had finished dinner he heard him  tell his father that there was trouble at a farm; and it was settled  that they should all drive over in the afternoon to some place with a  strange name. But when the time came Mr. Darnell was too deep in old  books and tobacco smoke to be stirred from his corner, and Edward and  his uncle went alone in the dog-cart. They drove swiftly down the narrow  lane, into the road that followed the winding river, and crossed the  bridge at Caermaen by the mouldering Roman walls, and then, skirting the  deserted, echoing village, they came out on a broad white turnpike road,  and the limestone dust followed them like a cloud. Then, suddenly, they  turned to the north by such a road as Edward had never seen before. It  was so narrow that there was barely room for the cart to pass, and the  footway was of rock, and the banks rose high above them as they slowly  climbed the long, steep way, and the untrimmed hedges on either side  shut out the light. And the ferns grew thick and green upon the banks,  and hidden wells dripped down upon them; and the old man told him how  the lane in winter was a torrent of swirling water, so that no one  could pass by it. On they went, ascending and then again descending,  always in that deep hollow under the wild woven boughs, and the boy  wondered vainly what the country was like on either side. And now the  air grew darker, and the hedge on one bank was but the verge of a dark  and rustling wood, and the grey limestone rocks had changed to dark-red  earth flecked with green patches and veins of marl, and suddenly in the  stillness from the depths of the wood a bird began to sing a melody that  charmed the heart into another world, that sang to the child's soul of  the blessed faery realm beyond the woods of the earth, where the wounds  of man are healed. And so at last, after many turnings and windings,  they came to a high bare land where the lane broadened out into a kind  of common, and along the edge of this place there were scattered three  or four old cottages, and one of them was a little tavern. Here they  stopped, and a man came out and tethered the tired horse to a post and  gave him water; and old Mr. Darnell took the child's hand and led him by  a path across the fields. The boy could see the country now, but it was  all a strange, undiscovered land; they were in the heart of a wilderness  of hills and valleys that he had never looked upon, and they were going  down a wild, steep hillside, where the narrow path wound in and out  amidst gorse and towering bracken, and the sun gleaming out for a  moment, there was a gleam of white water far below in a narrow valley,  where a little brook poured and rippled from stone to stone. They went  down the hill, and through a brake, and then, hidden in dark-green  orchards, they came upon a long, low whitewashed house, with a stone  roof strangely coloured by the growth of moss and lichens. Mr. Darnell  knocked at a heavy oaken door, and they came into a dim room where but  little light entered through the thick glass in the deep-set window.  There were heavy beams in the ceiling, and a great fireplace sent out an  odour of burning wood that Darnell never forgot, and the room seemed to  him full of women who talked all together in frightened tones. Mr.  Darnell beckoned to a tall, grey old man, who wore corduroy  knee-breeches, and the boy, sitting on a high straight-backed chair,  could see the old man and his uncle passing to and fro across the  window-panes, as they walked together on the garden path. The women  stopped their talk for a moment, and one of them brought him a glass of  milk and an apple from some"]]]
