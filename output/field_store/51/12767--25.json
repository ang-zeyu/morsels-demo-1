Thereafter he addressed this  speech to the Friar, \"May it not displease thee, so it be allowed  thee, to tell us if on the right hand lies any opening whereby we  two can go out without constraining any of the Black Angels to  come to deliver us from this deep.\" He answered then, \"Nearer  than thou hopest is a rock that from the great encircling wall  proceeds and crosses all the savage valleys, save that at this  one it is broken, and does not cover it. Ye can mount up over the  ruin that slopes on the side, and heaps up at the bottom.\" The  Leader stood a little while with bowed head, then said, \"Ill he  reported the matter, he who hooks the sinners yonder.\" [4] And  the Friar, \"I once heard tell at Bologna vices enough of the  devil, among which I heard that he is false, and the father of  lies.\" Then the Leader with great steps went on, disturbed a  little with anger in his look; whereon I departed from the  heavily burdened ones, following the prints of the beloved feet.    [1] They could not raise their heads for a straight look.    [2] Brothers of the order of Santa Maria, established in 1261,  with knightly vows and high intent. From their free life the  name of \"Jovial Friars\" was given to the members of the order.  After the battle of Montaperti (1260) the Ghibellines held the  upper hand in Florence for more than five years. The defeat and  death of Manfred early in 1266, at the battle of Benevento, shook  their power and revived the hopes of the Guelphs. As a measure of  compromise, the Florentine Commune elected two podestas, one from  each party; the Guelph was Catalano de' Malavolti, the  Ghibelline, Loderingo degli Andalo, both from Bologna. They were  believed to have joined hands for their own gain, and to have  favored the reviving power of the Guelphs. In the troubles of the  year the houses of the Uberti, a powerful Ghibelline family, were  burned. They lay in the region of the city called the Gardingo,  close to the Palazzo Vecchio.    [3] Annas \"was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high  priest that same year. Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to  the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the  people.\" John xviii. 13-14; id. xi. 47-50.    [4] Malacoda had told him that he would find a bridge not far off  by which to cross this sixth bolgia.        CANTO XXIV. Eighth Circle. The poets climb from the sixth pit.--  Seventh pit, filled with serpents, by which thieves are  tormented.--Vanni Fucci.--Prophecy of calamity to Dante.    In that part of the young year when the sun tempers his locks  beneath Aquarius,[1] and now the nights decrease toward half the  day,[2] when the hoar frost copies on the ground the image of her  white sister,[3] but the point of her pen lasts little while, the  rustic, whose provision fails \"gets up and sees the plain all  whitened o'er, whereat he strikes his thigh, returns indoors, and  grumbles here and there, like the poor wretch who knows not what  to do; again goes out and picks up hope again, seeing the world  to have changed face in short while, and takes his crook and  drives forth his flock to pasture\": in like manner the Master made  me dismayed, when I saw his front so disturbed, and in like  manner speedily arrived the plaster for the hurt. For when we  came to the ruined bridge, the Leader turned to me with that  sweet look which I first saw at the foot of the mount.[4] He  opened his arms, after some counsel taken with himself, looking  first well at the ruin, and laid hold of me. And as one who acts  and considers, who seems always to be ready beforehand, so  lifting me up toward the top of a great rock, he took note of  another splinter, saying, \"Seize hold next on that, but try first  if it is such that it may support thee.\" It was no way for one  clothed in a cloak, for we with difficulty, he light and I pushed  up, could mount from jag to jag. And had it not been that on that  precinct the bank was shorter than on the other side, I do not  know about him, but I should have been completely overcome. But  because all Malebolge slopes toward the opening of the lowest  abyss, the site of each valley is such that one side rises and  the other sinks.[5] We came, however, at length, up to the point  where the last stone is broken off. The breath was so milked from  my lungs when I was up that I could no farther, but sat me down  on first arrival.    [1] Toward the end of winter.    [2] Half of the twenty-four hours.

[4] The hill of the first Canto, at the foot of which Virgil had  appeared to Dante.    [5] The level of the whole circle slopes toward the central deep,  so that the inner side of each pit is of less height than the  outer.      \"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,\" said the Master,  \"for, sitting upon down or under quilt, one attains not fame,  without which he who consumes his life leaves of himself such  trace on earth as smoke in air, or in water the foam. And  therefore rise up, conquer the exhaustion with the spirit that  conquers every battle, if by its heavy body it be not dragged  down. A longer stairway needs must be ascended; it is not enough  from these to have departed; if thou understandest me, now act so  that it avail thee.\" Then I rose up, showing myself furnished  better with breath than I felt, and said, \"Go on, for I am strong  and resolute.\"    Up along the crag we took the way, which was rugged, narrow, and  difficult, and far steeper than the one before. I was going along  speaking in order not to seem breathless, and a voice, unsuitable  for forming words, came out from the next ditch. I know not  what it said, though I was already upon the back of the arch that  crosses here; but he who was speaking seemed moved to anger. I  had turned downwards, but living eyes could not go to the bottom,  because of the obscurity. Wherefore I said, \"Master, see that  thou go on to the next girth, and let us descend the wall, for as  from hence I hear and do not understand, so I look down and shape  out nothing.\" \"Other reply,\" he said, \"I give thee not than  doing, for an honest request ought to be followed by the deed in  silence.\"    We descended the bridge at its head, where it joins on with the  eighth bank, and then the pit was apparent to me. And I saw  therewithin a terrible heap of serpents, and of such hideous look  that the memory still curdles my blood. Let Libya with her sand  vaunt herself no more; for though she brings forth chelydri,  jaculi, and phareae, and cenchri with amphisboena, she never,  with all Ethiopia, nor with the land that lies on the Red Sea,  showed either so many plagues or so evil.    Amid this cruel and most dismal store were running people naked  and in terror, without hope of hole or heliotrope.[1] They had  their hands tied behind with serpents, which fixed through the  reins their tail and their head, and were knotted up in front.    [1] A precious stone, of green color, spotted with red, supposed  to make its wearer invisible.      And lo! at one, who was on our side, darted a serpent that  transfixed him there where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.  Nor _O_ nor _I_ was ever so quickly written as he took fire and  burned, and all ashes it behoved him to become in falling. And  when upon the ground he lay thus destroyed, the dust drew  together of itself, and into that same one instantly returned.  Thus by the great sages it is affirmed that the Phoenix dies, and  then is reborn when to her five hundredth year she draws  nigh. Nor herb nor grain she feeds on in her life, but only on  tears of incense and on balsam, and nard and myrrh are her last  winding-sheet.    And as he who falls and knows not how, by force of demon that  drags him to ground, or of other attack that seizeth the man;  when he arises and around him gazes, all bewildered by the great  anguish that he has suffered, and in looking sighs, such was that  sinner after he had risen. Oh power of God! how just thou art  that showerest down such blows for vengeance!    The Leader asked him then who he was; whereon he answered, \"I  rained from Tuscany short time ago into this fell gullet. Bestial  life, and not human, pleased me, like a mule that I was. I am  Vanni Fucci, beast, and Pistoia was my fitting den.\" And I to my  Leader, \"Tell him not to budge, and ask what sin thrust him down  here, for I have seen him a man of blood and rages.\" And the  sinner who heard dissembled not, but directed toward me his mind  and his face, and was painted with dismal shame. Then he said,  \"More it grieves me, that thou hast caught me in the misery where  thou seest me, than when I was taken from the other life. I  cannot refuse that which thou demandest. I am put so far down  because I was robber of the sacristy with the fair furnishings,  and falsely hitherto has it been ascribed to another.[1] But that  thou enjoy not this sight, if ever thou shalt be forth of these  dark places, open thine ears to my announcement and hear.[2]  Pistoia first strips itself of the Black, then Florence renovates  her people and her customs. Mars draws a flame from Val di Magra  wrapped in turbid clouds, and with impetuous and bitter storm  shall it be opposed upon Campo Piceno, where it shall suddenly  rend the mist, so that every White shall thereby be smitten. And  this have I said because it must grieve thee.\"    [1] Vanni Fucci robbed the rich sacristy of the Church of St.  James, the cathedral of Pistoia. Suspicion of the crime fell upon  others, who, though innocent, were put to torture and hung for  it.

Now two of  these reasons imply a blasphemy against God. For how shall we call  Him omnipotent, if He is unable to heal what is beyond hope? Or God  of all, if He has not made our soul. And as regards the other two  reasons, in one the cause of the soul is ignored, and in the other no  place is given to merit. Is He to be considered to understand the  cause of the soul, Who seeks to separate it from the sin of wilful  transgression, enabled as it is to receive the law by the endowment  of the habit of reason? Or how can His generosity be known to any one  who says it was despised on account of its ignoble sinfulness? If you  look at its origin, the substance of the soul is more precious than  the body: but if at the sin of transgression, on account of its  intelligence it is worse than the body. Now I know and declare that  Christ is perfect wisdom, nor have I any doubt that He is most  loving; and because of the first of these He did not despise what was  better and more capable of prudence; and because of the second He  protected what was most wounded.\" Thirdly, this position is against  the truth of the Incarnation. For flesh and the other parts of man  receive their species through the soul. Hence, if the soul is absent,  there are no bones nor flesh, except equivocally, as is plain from  the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 9; _Metaph._ vii, 34).    Reply Obj. 1: When we say, \"The Word was made flesh,\" \"flesh\" is  taken for the whole man, as if we were to say, \"The Word was made  man,\" as Isa. 40:5: \"All flesh together shall see that the mouth of  the Lord hath spoken.\" And the whole man is signified by flesh,  because, as is said in the authority quoted, the Son of God became  visible by flesh; hence it is subjoined: \"And we saw His glory.\" Or  because, as Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 80), \"in all that union  the Word is the highest, and flesh the last and lowest. Hence,  wishing to commend the love of God's humility to us, the Evangelist  mentioned the Word and flesh, leaving the soul on one side, since it  is less than the Word and nobler than flesh.\" Again, it was  reasonable to mention flesh, which, as being farther away from the  Word, was less assumable, as it would seem.    Reply Obj. 2: The Word is the fountain of life, as the first  effective cause of life; but the soul is the principle of the life of  the body, as its form. Now the form is the effect of the agent. Hence  from the presence of the Word it might rather have been concluded  that the body was animated, just as from the presence of fire it may  be concluded that the body, in which fire adheres, is warm.    Reply Obj. 3: It is not unfitting, indeed it is necessary to say that  in Christ there was a nature which was constituted by the soul coming  to the body. But Damascene denied that in Jesus Christ there was a  common species, i.e. a third something resulting from the Godhead and  the humanity.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 5, Art. 4]    Whether the Son of God Assumed a Human Mind or Intellect?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God did not assume a human  mind or intellect. For where a thing is present, its image is not  required. But man is made to God's image, as regards his mind, as  Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 3, 6). Hence, since in Christ there was  the presence of the Divine Word itself, there was no need of a human  mind.    Obj. 2: Further, the greater light dims the lesser. But the Word of  God, Who is \"the light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into  this world,\" as is written John 1:9, is compared to the mind as the  greater light to the lesser; since our mind is a light, being as it  were a lamp enkindled by the First Light (Prov. 20:27): \"The spirit  of a man is the lamp of the Lord.\" Therefore in Christ Who is the  Word of God, there is no need of a human mind.    Obj. 3: Further, the assumption of human nature by the Word of God is  called His Incarnation. But the intellect or human mind is nothing  carnal, either in its substance or in its act, for it is not the act  of a body, as is proved _De Anima_ iii, 6. Hence it would seem that  the Son of God did not assume a human mind.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum  xiv): \"Firmly hold and nowise doubt that Christ the Son of God has  true flesh and a rational soul of the same kind as ours, since of His  flesh He says (Luke 24:39): 'Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not  flesh and bones, as you see Me to have.' And He proves that He has a  soul, saying (John 17): 'I lay down My soul [Douay: 'life'] that I  may take it again.' And He proves that He has an intellect, saying  (Matt. 11:29): 'Learn of Me, because I am meek and humble of heart.'  And God says of Him by the prophet (Isa. 52:13): 'Behold my servant  shall understand.'\"    _I answer that,_ As Augustine says (De Haeres. 49, 50), \"the  Apollinarists thought differently from the Catholic Church concerning  the soul of Christ, saying with the Arians, that Christ took flesh  alone, without a soul; and on being overcome on this point by the  Gospel witness, they went on to say that the mind was wanting to  Christ's soul, but that the Word supplied its place.\" But this  position is refuted by the same arguments as the preceding. First,  because it runs counter to the Gospel story, which relates how He  marveled (as is plain from Matt. 8:10). Now marveling cannot be  without reason, since it implies the collation of effect and cause,  i.e. inasmuch as when we see an effect and are ignorant of its cause,  we seek to know it, as is said _Metaph._ i, 2. Secondly, it is  inconsistent with the purpose of the Incarnation, which is the  justification of man from sin. For the human soul is not capable of  sin nor of justifying grace except through the mind. Hence it was  especially necessary for the mind to be assumed. Hence Damascene says  (De Fide Orth. iii, 6) that \"the Word of God assumed a body and an  intellectual and rational soul,\" and adds afterwards: \"The whole was  united to the whole, that He might bestow salvation on me wholly; for  what was not assumed is not curable.\" Thirdly, it is against the  truth of the Incarnation. For since the body is proportioned to the  soul as matter to its proper form, it is not truly human flesh if it  is not perfected by human, i.e. a rational soul. And hence if Christ  had had a soul without a mind, He would not have had true human  flesh, but irrational flesh, since our soul differs from an animal  soul by the mind alone. Hence Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 80)  that from this error it would have followed that the Son of God \"took  an animal with the form of a human body,\" which, again, is against  the Divine truth, which cannot suffer any fictitious untruth.    Reply Obj. 1: Where a thing is by its presence, its image is not  required to supply the place of the thing, as where the emperor is  the soldiers do not pay homage to his image. Yet the image of a thing  is required together with its presence, that it may be perfected by  the presence of the thing, just as the image in the wax is perfected  by the impression of the seal, and as the image of man is reflected  in the mirror by his presence. Hence in order to perfect the human  mind it was necessary that the Word should unite it to Himself.    Reply Obj. 2: The greater light dims the lesser light of another  luminous body; but it does not dim, rather it perfects the light of  the body illuminated--at the presence of the sun the light of the  stars is put out, but the light of the air is perfected. Now the  intellect or mind of man is, as it were, a light lit up by the light  of the Divine Word; and hence by the presence of the Word the mind of  man is perfected rather than overshadowed.    Reply Obj. 3: Although the intellective power is not the act of a  body, nevertheless the essence of the human soul, which is the form  of the body, requires that it should be more noble, in order that it  may have the power of understanding; and hence it is necessary that a  better disposed body should correspond to it.  _______________________    QUESTION 6    OF THE ORDER OF ASSUMPTION  (In Six Articles)    We must now consider the order of the foregoing assumption, and under  this head there are six points of inquiry:    (1) Whether the Son of God assumed flesh through the medium of the  soul?    (2) Whether He assumed the soul through the medium of the spirit or  mind?    (3) Whether the soul was assumed previous to the flesh?    (4) Whether the flesh of Christ was assumed by the Word previous to  being united to the soul?    (5) Whether the whole human nature was assumed through the medium of  the parts?    (6) Whether it was assumed through the medium of grace?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [III, Q. 6, Art. 1]    Whether the Son of God Assumed Flesh Through the Medium of the Soul?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God did not assume flesh  through the medium of the soul. For the mode in which the Son of God  is united to human nature and its parts, is more perfect than the  mode whereby He is in all creatures. But He is in all creatures  immediately by essence, power and presence. Much more, therefore, is  the Son of God united to flesh without the medium of the soul.    Obj. 2: Further, the soul and flesh are united to the Word of God in  unity of hypostasis or person. But the body pertains immediately to  the human hypostasis or person, even as the soul. Indeed, the human  body, since it is matter, would rather seem to be nearer the  hypostasis than the soul, which is a form, since the principle of  individuation, which is implied in the word \"hypostasis,\" would seem  to be matter. Hence the Son of God did not assume flesh through the  medium of the soul.    Obj. 3: Further, take away the medium and you separate what were"]]]
