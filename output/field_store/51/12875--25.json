Hogarth once intended to have appealed from the critics' fiat to the  world's opinion, and employed Mr. Basire to make an engraving, which was  begun, but set aside for some other work, and never completed.    [Illustration: SIGISMONDA, WITH THE HEART OF HER HUSBAND.]          MARTIN FOLKES, ESQ.      Martin Folkes was a mathematician and antiquary of much celebrity in the  philosophical annals of this country. He was at the early age of  twenty-four admitted a member of the Royal Society, where he was greatly  distinguished. Two years afterwards he was chosen one of the council,  and was named by Sir Isaac Newton himself as vice president: he was  afterwards elected president, and held this high office till a short  time before his death, when he resigned it on account of ill-health. In  the Philosophical Transactions are numerous memoirs of this learned man:  his knowledge in coins, ancient and modern, was very extensive: and the  last work he produced was concerning the English Silver Coin from the  Conquest to his own time. He was president of the Society of Antiquaries  at the time of his death, which happened on the 28th of June, 1754, at  the age of sixty-four. A few days before his death he was struck with a  fit of the palsy, and never spoke after this attack.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF MARTIN FOLKES, ESQ.]          THE COCKPIT.      The scene is probably laid at Newmarket, and in this motley group of  peers,--pick-pockets,--butchers,--jockies,--rat-catchers,--gentlemen,  --gamblers of every denomination, Lord Albemarle Bertie, being the  principal figure, is entitled to precedence. In the March to Finchley,  we see him an attendant at a boxing match; and here he is president of a  most respectable society assembled at a cockpit. What rendered his  lordship's passion for amusements of this nature very singular, was his  being totally blind. In this place he is beset by seven steady friends,  five of whom at the same instant offer to bet with him on the event of  the battle. One of them, a lineal descendant of Filch, taking advantage  of his blindness and negligence, endeavours to convey a bank note,  deposited in our dignified gambler's hat, to his own pocket. Of this  ungentlemanlike attempt his lordship is apprised by a ragged post-boy,  and an honest butcher: but he is so much engaged in the pronunciation of  those important words, Done! Done! Done! Done! and the arrangement of  his bets, that he cannot attend to their hints; and it seems more than  probable that the stock will be transferred, and the note negociated in  a few seconds.    A very curious group surround the old nobleman, who is adorned with a  riband, a star, and a pair of spectacles. The whole weight of an  overgrown carpenter being laid upon his shoulder, forces our illustrious  personage upon a man beneath; who being thus driven downward, falls upon  a fourth, and the fourth, by the accumulated pressure of this ponderous  trio, composed of the upper and lower house, loses his balance, and  tumbling against the edge of the partition, his head is broke, and his  wig, shook from the seat of reason, falls into the cockpit.    A man adjoining enters into the spirit of the battle,--his whole soul is  engaged. From his distorted countenance, and clasped hands, we see that  he feels every stroke given to his favourite bird in his heart's  core,--ay, in his heart of hearts! A person at the old peer's left hand  is likely to be a loser. Ill-humour, vexation, and disappointment are  painted in his countenance. The chimney-sweeper above, is the very  quintessence of affectation. He has all the airs and graces of a  boarding-school miss. The sanctified quaker adjoining, and the fellow  beneath, who, by the way, is a very similar figure to Captain Stab, in  the Rake's Progress, are finely contrasted.    A French marquis on the other side, astonished at this being called  amusement, is exclaiming Sauvages! Sauvages! Sauvages!--Engrossed by the  scene, and opening his snuff-box rather carelessly, its contents fall  into the eyes of a man below, who, sneezing and swearing alternately,  imprecates bitter curses on this devil's dust, that extorts from his  inflamed eyes, \"A sea of melting pearls, which some call tears.\"    Adjoining is an old cripple, with a trumpet at his ear, and in this  trumpet a person in a bag-wig roars in a manner that cannot much gratify  the auricular nerves of his companions; but as for the object to whom  the voice is directed, he seems totally insensible to sounds, and if  judgment can be formed from appearances, might very composedly stand  close to the clock of St. Paul's Cathedral, when it was striking twelve.    The figure with a cock peeping out of a bag, is said to be intended for  Jackson, a jockey; the gravity of this experienced veteran, and the cool  sedateness of a man registering the wagers, are well opposed by the  grinning woman behind, and the heated impetuosity of a fellow, stripped  to his shirt, throwing his coin upon the cockpit, and offering to back  Ginger against Pye for a guinea.    On the lower side, where there is only one tier of figures, a sort of an  apothecary, and a jockey, are stretching out their arms, and striking  together the handles of their whips, in token of a bet. An hiccuping  votary of Bacchus, displaying a half-emptied purse, is not likely to  possess it long, for an adroit professor of legerdemain has taken aim  with a hooked stick, and by one slight jerk, will convey it to his own  pocket. The profession of a gentleman in a round wig is determined by a  gibbet chalked upon his coat. An enraged barber, who lifts up his stick  in the corner, has probably been refused payment of a wager, by the man  at whom he is striking.    A cloud-capt philosopher at the top of the print, coolly smoking his  pipe, unmoved by this crash of matter, and wreck of property, must not  be overlooked: neither should his dog be neglected; for the dog, gravely  resting his fore paws upon the partition, and contemplating the company,  seems more interested in the event of the battle than his master.    Like the tremendous Gog, and terrific Magog, of Guildhall, stand the two  cock-feeders; a foot of each of these consequential purveyors is seen at  the two extremities of the pit.    As to the birds, whose attractive powers have drawn this admiring throng  together, they deserved earlier notice:        Each hero burns to conquer or to die,      What mighty hearts in little bosoms lie!    Having disposed of the substances, let us now attend to the shadow on  the cockpit, and this it seems is the reflection of a man drawn up to  the ceiling in a basket, and there suspended, as a punishment for having  betted more money than he can pay. Though suspended, he is not  reclaimed; though exposed, not abashed; for in this degrading situation  he offers to stake his watch against money, in another wager on his  favourite champion.    The decorations of this curious theatre are, a portrait of Nan Rawlins,  and the King's arms.    In the margin at the bottom of the print is an oval, with a fighting  cock, inscribed ROYAL SPORT.    Of the characteristic distinctions in this heterogeneous assembly, it is  not easy to speak with sufficient praise. The chimney-sweeper's absurd  affectation sets the similar airs of the Frenchman in a most ridiculous  point of view. The old fellow with a trumpet at his ear, has a degree of  deafness that I never before saw delineated; he might have lived in the  same apartment with Xantippe, or slept comfortably in Alexander the  copper-smith's first floor. As to the nobleman in the centre, in the  language of the turf, he is a mere pigeon; and the peer, with a star and  garter, in the language of Cambridge, we must class as--a mere quiz. The  man sneezing,--you absolutely hear; and the fellow stealing a bank  note,--has all the outward and visible marks of a perfect and  accomplished pick-pocket; Mercury himself could not do that business in  a more masterly style.    Tyers tells us that \"Pope, while living with his father at Chiswick,  before he went to Binfield, took great delight in cock-fighting, and  laid out all his school-boy money, and little perhaps it was, in buying  fighting cocks.\" Lord Orrery observes, \"If we may judge of Mr. Pope from  his works, his chief aim was to be esteemed a man of virtue.\" When  actions can be clearly ascertained, it is not necessary to seek the  mind's construction in the writings: and we must regret being compelled  to believe that some of Mr. Pope's actions, at the same time that they  prove him to be querulous and petulant, lead us to suspect that he was  also envious, malignant, and cruel. How far this will tend to confirm  the assertion, that when a boy, he was an amateur of this royal sport, I  do, says Mr. Ireland, not pretend to decide: but were a child, in whom I  had any interest, cursed with such a propensity, my first object would  be to correct it: if that were impracticable, and he retained a fondness  for the cockpit, and the still more detestable amusement of Shrove  Tuesday, I should hardly dare to flatter myself that he could become a  merciful man.--The subject has carried me farther than I intended: I  will, however, take the freedom of proposing one query to the  consideration of the clergy,--Might it not have a tendency to check that  barbarous spirit, which has more frequently its source in an early  acquired habit, arising from the prevalence of example, than in natural  depravity, if every divine in Great Britain were to preach at least one  sermon every twelve months, on our universal insensibility to the  sufferings of the brute creation?        Wilt thou draw near the nature of the Gods,      Draw near them then in being merciful;      Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.    [Illustration: THE COCK PIT.]          CAPTAIN THOMAS CORAM.
