What the Council had done was merely to assent to a definition of the  dogma of the Infallibility of the Roman Pontiff which Pius IX had  issued, proprio motu, a few days before. The definition itself was  perhaps somewhat less extreme than might have been expected. The Pope,  it declared, is possessed, when he speaks ex cathedra, of 'that  infallibility with which the Redeemer willed that His Church should be  endowed for defining doctrine regarding faith or morals'. Thus it became  a dogma of faith that a Papal definition regarding faith or morals is  infallible; but beyond that, both the Holy Father and the Council  maintained a judicious reserve. Over what OTHER matters besides faith  and morals the Papal infallibility might or might not extend still  remained in doubt. And there were further questions, no less serious, to  which no decisive answer was then, or ever has been since, provided.    How was it to be determined, for instance, which particular Papal  decisions did in fact come within the scope of the definition? Who was  to decide what was or was not a matter of faith or morals? Or precisely  WHEN the Roman Pontiff was speaking ex cathedra? Was the famous Syllabus  Errorum, for example, issued ex cathedra or not? Grave theologians have  never been able to make up their minds. Yet to admit doubts in such  matters as these is surely dangerous. 'In duty to our supreme pastoral  office,' proclaimed the Sovereign Pontiff, 'by the bowels of Christ we  earnestly entreat all Christ's faithful people, and we also command them  by the authority of God and our Saviour, that they study and labour to  expel and eliminate errors and display the light of the purest faith.'  Well might the faithful study and labour to such ends! For, while the  offence remained ambiguous, there was no ambiguity about the penalty.  One hair's-breadth from the unknown path of truth, one shadow of  impurity in the mysterious light of faith, and there shall be anathema!  anathema! anathema! When the framers of such edicts called upon the  bowels of Christ to justify them, might they not have done well to have  paused a little, and to have called to mind the counsel of another  sovereign ruler, though a heretic--Oliver Cromwell? 'Bethink ye, bethink  ye, in the bowels of Christ, that ye may be mistaken!'    One of the secondary results of the Council was the excommunication of  Dr. Dollinger, and a few more of the most uncompromising of the  Inopportunists. Among these, however, Lord Acton was not included.  Nobody ever discovered why. Was it because he was too important for the  Holy See to care to interfere with him? Or was it because he was not  important enough?    Another ulterior consequence was the appearance of a pamphlet by Mr.  Gladstone, entitled 'Vaticanism', in which the awful implications  involved in the declaration of Infallibility were laid before the  British Public. How was it possible, Mr. Gladstone asked, with all the  fulminating accompaniments of his most agitated rhetoric, to depend  henceforward upon the civil allegiance of Roman Catholics? To this  question the words of Cardinal Antonelli to the Austrian Ambassador  might have seemed a sufficient reply. 'There is a great difference,'  said his Eminence, between theory and practice. No one will ever prevent  the Church from proclaiming the great principles upon which its Divine  fabric is based; but, as regards the application of those sacred laws,  the Church, imitating the example of its Divine Founder, is inclined to  take into consideration the natural weaknesses of mankind.' And, in any  case, it was hard to see how the system of Faith, which had enabled Pope  Gregory XIII to effect, by the hands of English Catholics, a whole  series of attempts to murder Queen Elizabeth, can have been rendered a  much more dangerous engine of disloyalty by the Definition of 1870. But  such considerations failed to reassure Mr. Gladstone; the British Public  was of a like mind; and 145,000 copies of the pamphlet were sold within  two months. Various replies appeared, and Manning was not behindhand.  His share in the controversy led to a curious personal encounter.    His conversion had come as a great shock to Mr. Gladstone. Manning had  breathed no word of its approach to his old and intimate friend, and  when the news reached him, it seemed almost an act of personal injury.  'I felt,' Mr. Gladstone said, 'as if Manning had murdered my mother by  mistake.' For twelve years the two men did not meet, after which they  occasionally saw each other and renewed their correspondence. This was  the condition of affairs when Mr. Gladstone published his pamphlet. As  soon as it appeared, Manning wrote a letter to the New York Herald,  contradicting its conclusions and declaring that its publication was  'the first event that has overcast a friendship of forty-five years'.  Mr. Gladstone replied to this letter in a second pamphlet. At the close  of his theological arguments, he added the following passage:    'I feel it necessary, in concluding this answer, to state that  Archbishop Manning has fallen into most serious inaccuracy in his letter  of November 10th, wherein he describes 'my Expostulation as the first  event which has overcast a friendship of forty-five years. I allude to  the subject with regret; and without entering into details.'    Manning replied in a private letter:    'My dear Gladstone,' he wrote, 'you say that I am in error in stating  that your former pamphlet is the first act which has overcast our  friendship.    'If you refer to my act in 1851 in submitting to the Catholic Church, by  which we were separated for some twelve years, I can understand it.    'If you refer to any other act either on your part or mine I am not  conscious of it, and would desire to know what it may be.    'My act in 1851 may have overcast your friendship for me. It did not  overcast my friendship for you, as I think the last years have shown.    'You will not, I hope, think me over-sensitive in asking for this  explanation. Believe me, yours affectionately,    'H. E. M.'    'My dear Archbishop Manning,' Mr. Gladstone answered, 'it did, I  confess, seem to me an astonishing error to state in public that a  friendship had not been overcast for forty-five years until now, which  your letter declares has been suspended as to all action for twelve ...    'I wonder, too, at your forgetting that during the forty-five years I  had been charged by you with doing the work of the Antichrist in regard  to the Temporal Power of the Pope.    'Our differences, my dear Archbishop, are indeed profound. We refer  them, I suppose, in humble silence to a Higher Power ... You assured me  once of your prayers at all and at the most solemn time. I received that  assurance with gratitude, and still cherish it. As and when they move  upwards, there is a meeting-point for those whom a chasm separates  below. I remain always, affectionately yours,    'W. E. GLADSTONE.'    Speaking of this correspondence in after years, Cardinal Manning said:  'From the way in which Mr. Gladstone alluded to the overcasting of our  friendship, people might have thought that I had picked his pocket.'      VIII    IN 1875, Manning's labours received their final reward: he was made a  Cardinal. His long and strange career, with its high hopes, its bitter  disappointments, its struggles, its renunciations, had come at last to  fruition in a Princedom of the Church.    'Ask in faith and in perfect confidence,' he himself once wrote, and God  will give us what we ask. You may say, \"But do you mean that He will  give us the very thing?\" That, God has not said. God has said that He  will give you whatsoever you ask; but the form in which it will come,  and the time in which He will give it, He keeps in His own power.  Sometimes our prayers are answered in the very things which we put from  us; sometimes it may be a chastisement, or a loss, or a visitation  against which our hearts rise, and we seem to see that God has not only  forgotten us, but has begun to deal with us in severity. Those very  things are the answers to our prayers. He knows what we desire, and He  gives us the things for which we ask; but in the form which His own  Divine Wisdom sees to be best.'    There was one to whom Manning's elevation would no doubt have given a  peculiar satisfaction--his old friend Monsignor Talbot. But this was not  to be. That industrious worker in the cause of Rome had been removed  some years previously to a sequestered home at Passy, whose padded walls  were impervious to the rumours of the outer world. Pius IX had been much  afflicted by this unfortunate event; he had not been able to resign  himself to the loss of his secretary, and he had given orders that  Monsignor Talbot's apartment in the Vatican should be preserved  precisely as he had left it, in case of his return. But Monsignor Talbot  never returned. Manning's feelings upon the subject appear to have been  less tender than the Pope's. In all his letters, in all his papers, in  all his biographical memoranda, not a word of allusion is to be found to  the misfortune, nor to the death, of the most loyal of his adherents.  Monsignor Talbot's name disappears suddenly and for ever--like a stone  cast into the waters.    Manning was now an old man, and his outward form had assumed that  appearance of austere asceticism which is, perhaps, the one thing  immediately suggested by his name to the ordinary Englishman. The spare  and stately form, the head--massive, emaciated, terrible--with the great  nose, the glittering eyes, and the mouth drawn back and compressed into  the grim rigidities of age, self-mortification, and authority--such is  the vision that still lingers in the public mind--the vision which,  actual and palpable like some embodied memory of the Middle Ages, used  to pass and repass, less than a generation since, through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#19)"],[1,". What the law really  forbids, and the only thing it forbids, is the act on the wrong  side of the line, be that act blameworthy or otherwise.    Again, any legal standard must, in theory, be one which would  apply to all men, not specially excepted, under the same  circumstances. It is not intended that the public force should  fall upon an individual accidentally, or at the whim of any body  of men. The standard, that is, [111] must be fixed. In practice,  no doubt, one man may have to pay and another may escape,  according to the different feelings of different juries. But this  merely shows that the law does not perfectly accomplish its ends.  The theory or intention of the law is not that the feeling of  approbation or blame which a particular twelve may entertain  should be the criterion. They are supposed to leave their  idiosyncrasies on one side, and to represent the feeling of the  community. The ideal average prudent man, whose equivalent the  jury is taken to be in many cases, and whose culpability or  innocence is the supposed test, is a constant, and his conduct  under given circumstances is theoretically always the same.    Finally, any legal standard must, in theory, be capable of being  known. When a man has to pay damages, he is supposed to have  broken the law, and he is further supposed to have known what the  law was.    If, now, the ordinary liabilities in tort arise from failure to  comply with fixed and uniform standards of external conduct,  which every man is presumed and required to know, it is obvious  that it ought to be possible, sooner or later, to formulate these  standards at least to some extent, and that to do so must at last  be the business of the court. It is equally clear that the  featureless generality, that the defendant was bound to use such  care as a prudent man would do under the circumstances, ought to  be continually giving place to the specific one, that he was  bound to use this or that precaution under these or those  circumstances. The standard which the defendant was bound to come  up to was a standard of specific acts or omissions, with  reference to the specific circumstances in which he found  himself. If in the whole department of [112] unintentional wrongs  the courts arrived at no further utterance than the question of  negligence, and left every case, without rudder or compass, to  the jury, they would simply confess their inability to state a  very large part of the law which they required the defendant to  know, and would assert, by implication, that nothing could be  learned by experience. But neither courts nor legislatures have  ever stopped at that point.    From the time of Alfred to the present day, statutes and  decisions have busied themselves with defining the precautions to  be taken in certain familiar cases; that is, with substituting  for the vague test of the care exercised by a prudent man, a  precise one of specific acts or omissions. The fundamental  thought is still the same, that the way prescribed is that in  which prudent men are in the habit of acting, or else is one laid  down for cases where prudent men might otherwise be in doubt.    It will be observed that the existence of the external tests of  liability which will be mentioned, while it illustrates the  tendency of the law of tort to become more and more concrete by  judicial decision and by statute, does not interfere with the  general doctrine maintained as to the grounds of liability. The  argument of this Lecture, although opposed to the doctrine that a  man acts or exerts force at his peril, is by no means opposed to  the doctrine that he does certain particular acts at his peril.  It is the coarseness, not the nature, of the standard which is  objected to. If, when the question of the defendant's negligence  is left to a jury, negligence does not mean the actual state of  the defendant's mind, but a failure to act as a prudent man of  average intelligence would have done, he is required to conform  to an objective standard at his [113] peril, even in that case.  When a more exact and specific rule has been arrived at, he must  obey that rule at his peril to the same extent. But, further, if  the law is wholly a standard of external conduct, a man must  always comply with that standard at his peril.    Some examples of the process of specification will be useful. In  LL. Alfred, 36, /1/ providing for the case of a man's staking  himself on a spear carried by another, we read, \"Let this  (liability) be if the point be three fingers higher than the  hindmost part of the shaft; if they be both on a level,... be  that without danger.\"    The rule of the road and the sailing rules adopted by Congress  from England are modern examples of such statutes. By the former  rule, the question has been narrowed from the vague one, Was the  party negligent? to the precise one, Was he on the right or left  of the road? To avoid a possible misconception, it may be  observed that, of course, this question does not necessarily and  under all circumstances decide that of liability; a plaintiff may  have been on the wrong side of the road, as he may have been  negligent, and yet the conduct of the defendant may have been  unjustifiable, and a ground of liability. /2/ So, no doubt, a  defendant could justify or excuse being on the wrong side, under  some circumstances. The difference between alleging that a  defendant was on the wrong side of the road, and that he was  negligent, is the difference between an allegation of facts  requiring to be excused by a counter allegation of further facts  to prevent their being a ground of liability, and an allegation  which involves a conclusion of law, and denies in advance the  existence of an [114] excuse. Whether the former allegation ought  not to be enough, and whether the establishment of the fact ought  not to shift the burden of proof, are questions which belong to  the theory of pleading and evidence, and could be answered either  way consistently with analogy. I should have no difficulty in  saying that the allegation of facts which are ordinarily a ground  of liability, and which would be so unless excused, ought to be  sufficient. But the forms of the law, especially the forms of  pleading, do not change with every change of its substance, and a  prudent lawyer would use the broader and safer phrase.    The same course of specification which has been illustrated from  the statute-book ought also to be taking place in the growth of  judicial decisions. That this should happen is in accordance with  the past history of the law. It has been suggested already that  in the days of the assize and jurata the court decided whether  the facts constituted a ground of liability in all ordinary  cases. A question of negligence might, no doubt, have gone to the  jury. Common sense and common knowledge are as often sufficient  to determine whether proper care has been taken of an animal, as  they are to say whether A or B owns it. The cases which first  arose were not of a kind to suggest analysis, and negligence was  used as a proximately simple element for a long time before the  need or possibility of analysis was felt. Still, when an issue of  this sort is found, the dispute is rather what the acts or  omissions of the defendant were than on the standard of conduct.  /1/ The [115] distinction between the functions of court and jury  does not come in question until the parties differ as to the  standard of conduct. Negligence, like ownership, is a complex  conception. Just as the latter imports the existence of certain  facts, and also the consequence (protection against all the  world) which the law attaches to those facts; the former imports  the existence of certain facts (conduct) and also the consequence  (liability) which the law attaches to those facts. In most cases  the question is upon the facts, and it is only occasionally that  one arises on the consequence.    It will have been noticed how the judges pass on the defendant's  acts (on grounds of fault and public policy) in the case of the  thorns, and that in Weaver v. Ward /1/it is said that the facts  constituting an excuse, and showing that the defendant was free  from negligence, should have been spread upon the record, in  order that the court might judge. A similar requirement was laid  down with regard to the defence of probable cause in an action  for malicious prosecution. /2/ And to this day the question of  probable cause is always passed on by the court. Later evidence  will be found in what follows.    There is, however, an important consideration, which has not yet  been adverted to. It is undoubtedly possible that those who have  the making of the law should deem it wise to put the mark higher  in some cases than the point established by common practice at  which blameworthiness begins. For instance, in Morris v. Platt,  /2/ the court, while declaring in the strongest terms that, in  general, [116] negligence is the foundation of liability for  accidental trespasses, nevertheless hints that, if a decision of  the point were necessary, it might hold a defendant to a stricter  rule where the damage was caused by a pistol, in view of the  danger to the public of the growing habit of carrying deadly  weapons. Again, it might well seem that to enter a man's house  for the purpose of carrying a present, or inquiring after his  health when he was ill, was a harmless and rather praiseworthy  act, although crossing the owner's boundary was intentional. It  is not supposed that an action would lie at the present day for  such a cause, unless the defendant had been forbidden the house.  Yet in the time of Henry VIII. it was said to be actionable if  without license, \"for then under that color my enemy might be in  my house and kill me.\" /1/ There is a clear case where public  policy establishes a standard of overt acts without regard to  fault in any sense. In like manner,"]]]
