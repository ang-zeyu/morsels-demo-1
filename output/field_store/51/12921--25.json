SECTION X. _How to know with whom to deal._    There are two maxims in common life that seem to clash with each other,  most pointedly. The first is, 'Use every precaution with a stranger,  that you would wish you had done, should he turn out to be a villain;'  and secondly, 'Treat every man as an honest man, until he proves to be  otherwise.'    Now there is good advice in both these maxims. By this I mean that they  may both be observed, to a certain extent, without interfering with  each other. You may be cautious about hastily becoming acquainted with  a stranger, and yet so far as you have any concern with him, treat him  like an honest man. No _reasonable_ person will complain if you do not  unbosom yourself to him at once. And if he is unreasonable, you will  not _wish_ for an intimate acquaintance with him.    My present purpose is to offer a few hints, with a view to assist you  in judging of the characters of those with whom it may be your lot to  deal. Remember, however, that like all things human, they are  imperfect. All I can say is that they are the best I can offer.    There is something in knavery that will hardly bear the inspection of a  piercing eye; and you may, more generally, observe in a sharper an  unsteady and confused look. If a person is persuaded of the uncommon  sagacity of one before whom he is to appear, he will hardly succeed in  mustering impudence and artifice enough to bear him through without  faltering. It will, therefore, be a good way to try one whom you have  reason to suspect of a design upon you, by fixing your eyes upon his,  and bringing up a supposition of your having to do with one whose  integrity you suspected; stating what you would do in such a case. If  the person you are talking with be really what you expect, he will  hardly be able to keep his countenance.    It will be a safe rule,--though doubtless there are exceptions to  it,--to take mankind to be more or less avaricious. Yet a great love of  money is a great enemy to honesty. The aged are, in this respect, more  dangerous than the young. It will be your wisdom ever to be cautious of  _aged_ avarice; and especially of those who, in an affected and forced  manner, bring in religion, and talk much of _duty_ on all occasions; of  all smooth and fawning people; of those who are very talkative, and  who, in dealing with you, endeavor to draw off your attention from the  point in hand by incoherent or random expressions.    I have already advised you how to proceed with those of whom you have  good reason to be suspicious. But by all means avoid entertaining  unnecessary suspicions of your fellow beings; for it will usually  render both you and them the more miserable. It is often owing to a  consciousness of a designing temper, in ourselves, that we are led to  suspect others.    If you hear a person boasting of having got a remarkably good bargain,  you may generally conclude him by no means too honest; for almost  always where one gains much in a bargain, the other loses. I know well  that cases occur where both parties are gainers, but not greatly so.  And when you hear a man triumph in gaining by another's loss, you may  easily judge of his character.    Let me warn you against the sanguine promisers. Of these there are two  sorts. The first are those who from a foolish custom of fawning upon  all those whom they meet with in company, have acquired a habit of  promising great favors which they have no idea of performing. The  second are a sort of warm hearted people, who while they lavish their  promises have some thoughts of performing them; but when the time  comes, and the sanguine fit is worn off, the trouble or expense appears  in another light; the promiser cools, and the expectant is  disappointed.    Be cautious of dealing with an avaricious and cruel man, for if it  should happen by an unlucky turn of trade that you should come into the  power of such a person, you have nothing to expect but the utmost rigor  of the law.    In negotiating, there are a number of circumstances to be considered;  the neglect of any of which may defeat your whole scheme. These will be  mentioned in the next section.      SECTION XI. _How to take Men as they are._    Such a knowledge of human character as will enable us to treat mankind  according to their dispositions, circumstances, and modes of thinking,  so as to secure their aid in all our _laudable_ purposes, is absolutely  indispensable. And while all men boast of their knowledge of human  nature, and would rather be thought ignorant of almost every thing else  than this, how obvious it is that there is nothing in regard to which  there exists so much ignorance!    A miser is by no means a proper person to apply to for a favor that  will _cost_ him any thing. But if he chance to be a man of principle,  he _may_ make an excellent partner in trade, or arbitrator in a dispute  about property; for he will have patience to investigate little things,  and to stand about trifles, which a generous man would scorn. Still, as  an honest man, and above all as a Christian, I doubt whether it would  be quite right thus to derive advantage from the vices of another. In  employing the miser, you give scope to his particular vice.    A passionate man will fly into a rage at the most trifling affront, but  he will generally forget it nearly as soon, and be glad to do any thing  in his power to make up with you. It is not therefore so dangerous to  disoblige _him_, as the gloomy, sullen mortal, who will wait seven  years for an opportunity to do you mischief.    A cool, slow man, who is somewhat advanced in age, is generally the  best person to advise with. For despatch of business, however, make use  of the young, the warm, and the sanguine. Some men are of no character  at all; but always take a tinge from the last company they were in.  Their advice, as well as their assistance, is usually good for nothing.    It is in vain to think of finding any thing very valuable in the mind  of a covetous man. Avarice is generally the vice of abject spirits. Men  who have a very great talent at making money, commonly have no other;  for the man who began with nothing, and has accumulated wealth, has  been too busy to think of improving his mind; or indeed, to think of  any thing else but property.    A boaster is always to be suspected. His is a natural infirmity, which  makes him forget what he is about, and run into a thousand  extravagances that have no connection with the truth. With those who  have a tolerable knowledge of the world, all his assertions,  professions of friendship, promises, and threatenings, go for nothing.  Trust him with a secret, and he will surely discover it, either through  vanity or levity.    A meek tempered man is not quite the proper person for you; his  _modesty_ will be easily _confounded_.--The talkative man will be apt  to forget himself, and blunder out something that will give you  trouble.    A man's ruling passion is the key by which you may come at his  character, and pretty nearly guess how he will act in any given  circumstances, unless he is a wit or a fool; _they_ act chiefly from  caprice.    There are likewise connections between the different _parts_ of men's  characters, which it will be useful for you to study. For example, if  you find a man to be hasty and passionate, you may generally take it  for granted he is open and artless, and so on. Like other general  rules, however, this admits of many exceptions.    A bully is usually a coward. When, therefore, you unluckily have to  deal with such a man, the best way is to make up to him boldly, and  answer him with firmness. If you show the least sign of submission, he  will take advantage of it to use you ill.    There are six sorts of people, at whose hands you need not expect much  kindness. The _sordid and narrow minded_, think of nobody but  themselves. The _lazy_ will not take the trouble to oblige you. The  _busy_ have not time to think of you. The overgrown _rich man_, is  above regarding any one, how much soever he may stand in need of  assistance. The _poor and unhappy_ often have not the ability. The good  natured _simpleton_, however willing, is _incapable_ of serving you.[7]    The _age_ of the person you are to deal with is also to be considered.  _Young_ people are easily drawn into any scheme, merely from its being  new, especially if it falls in with their love of pleasure; but they  are almost as easily discouraged from it by the next person they meet  with. They are not good counsellors, for they are apt to be precipitate  and thoughtless; but are very fit for action, where you prescribe them  a track from which they know they must not vary. Old age, on the  contrary, is slow but sure; very cautious; opposed to new schemes and  ways of life; inclining, generally, to covetousness; fitter to  _consult_ with you, than to _act_ for you; not so easily won by fair  speeches or long reasonings; tenacious of old opinions, customs, and  formalities; apt to be displeased with those, especially younger  people, who pretend to question their judgment; fond of deference, and  of being listened to. Young people, in their anger, mean less than they  say; old people more. You may make up for an injury with most young  men; the old are generally more slow in forgiving.    The fittest character to be concerned with in business, is, that in  which are united an inviolable integrity, founded upon rational  principles of virtue and religion, a cool but determined temper, a  friendly heart, a ready hand, long experience and extensive knowledge  of the world; with a solid reputation of many years' standing, and easy  circumstances.

Next morning we had left Boshof and its green streets behind, and  were winding along the road, the line of patrols sweeping like a long  billow over the hills before and on each side of us. We paused for a  night at Zwaartzkopjesfontein, went on the next morning to  Mahemsfontein; whence, having received orders from Lord Roberts to halt,  we fell back on Zwaartzkopjesfontein.    On Monday morning, April 9th, I went out with the Yeomanry, who made a  reconnaissance ten miles to the east. We found a party of about sixty  Boers chasing goats and cattle and stock of all kinds on a Dutch farm  occupied only by women. We could see them through glasses driving the  stock away (about sixty head), but they only fired a shot or two at one  of our scouts, and then fled, taking and keeping a four-mile start of  us. This expedition was at least interesting, as again showing the  really excellent work and methods of the Yeomanry. They cared for their  horses in a more intelligent way than any regular cavalry I have seen,  and they were not above taking hints from the Colonials in the matter  of marching and patrolling order. Everyone was surprised. It had been  quite the thing to smile at the very mention of the Yeomanry; yet they  speedily proved themselves quite equal to take their place beside any  other of the Volunteers, even the best of the Colonial mounted corps.    With a charming courtesy Lord Methuen designed and erected at his own  expense a monument over the grave of his fallen enemy. On the stone is  engraved this inscription:--                                    [cross]                             A LA MEMOIRE                   DU COMTE DE VILLEBOIS DE MAREUIL                             ANCIEN COLONEL                         DE LA LEGION ETRANGERE                                EN FRANCE                          GENERAL DU TRANSVAAL                         MORT AU CHAMP D'HONNEUR                              PRES DE BOSHOF                              LE 5 AVRIL, 1900                            DANS SA 53eme ANNEE                                   R.I.P.          XV    AN ELUSIVE ENEMY      In spite of their former experiences the troops under Lord Methuen were  in some danger of forgetting the sterner realities of warfare, and of  mistaking for them the mere physical discomforts incidental to life  afield in rough weather. The camp at Zwaartzkopjesfontein--the highest  point of land within a large area--was scattered amongst rocks and  boulders piled high into an island ridge rising from the plain; and  amongst the rocks and ferns one found here and there a piece of lawn  (long untrodden by any feet but those of goats) large enough to picket  one's horses and pitch one's tent upon. Eastward the plain stretched to  the horizon, as level as the sea; indeed, in a landscape so monotonous  that one was fain to decorate it with fancies, it stood for the sea, and  touched the rocky base of our island as the sea washes many a mile of  bluff coast. Winter was setting in, and all day long wreaths of mist and  banks of rain came blowing from the eastward (the seaward, as we called  it), and shrouded the brown rock. The signallers on the height used to  wrap themselves in their oilskins as darkness fell and lamps took the  place of flags and spy-glasses; in the dark gusty hours we heard the  \"all's well\" of a sentry as the visiting patrol went by, much as one  hears the cry of the watch on board ship; and down below, the  mimosa-trees sighed like surges against the foot of the rock.    The ten days spent there by the troops were marked by only two  expeditions against the invisible enemy, neither of which achieved  anything but a nominal result. One was under Colonel Mahon, and repaired  the telegraph line in the neighbourhood of Modder River; it was intended  to patrol as far as Klip Drift, but the rain made the veldt impassable  for waggons. Certainly the line was repaired, but, as the Colonel  contemptuously remarked, \"What's the use of sending an expedition to  repair telegraph lines? An old woman can cut 'em again ten minutes after  you've gone.\"    The other flying column was under General Douglas, and was sent out  eastward in search of a commando known to be in the neighbourhood. As  both columns started on the same day (April 11th) I could not be with  both, so I chose General Douglas's as offering the better chances of an  engagement. Two days before Lord Chesham had conducted a reconnaissance  with his cavalry, to which I had been invited, and at which he had  promised me \"fine sport.\" Result: a fine cross-country gallop, a deal of  used-up horseflesh, a number of tired and (because they had been hurried  out without their breakfasts) rather cross men, and a sight of a few  Boers riding off at a distance of five miles. \"Butterflies\" was  someone's description of these elusive enemies of ours; and when one  considers what a fine chase they gave us, and how hot and cross we  became in the course of it, the description seems not inapt.    General Douglas's column, consisting of a battalion of the Northamptons,  300 Imperial Yeomanry, 50 men of the Kimberley Mounted Corps, a section  of Field Artillery, Ambulance and Supply Corps, set out before dawn on  Wednesday, April 11th. We marched, as it had hitherto been my lot always  to march in this campaign, eastwards towards the fires of dawn, leaving  the dark night-sky behind us. The waggons creaked and jolted across the  rough veldt, the gun harness jingled, the horses snorted out the cold  air, the Kaffirs cried to their beasts; and in this discordant chorus we  stretched out across the sea-plain while the east kindled and glowed.  Above us the clouds changed from grey to dove-colour, from that to  rose-pink; and then, straight before us, the sun came up and gave us  gold for redness. The little purple wild flowers opened, showing us  where the night had left a jewel on every petal, and the sleepy soldiers  plucked them as they passed and cheered themselves with their faint  fragrance. The day, like the night, comes quickly there, and brings with  it an even greater change. For in that last week of autumn we tasted of  every season; hot summer days, nights of spring, dark, cold winter  mornings by the camp fire; and it was when night changed to day that  winter faded into summer. For that reason, I suppose, the hour after  sunrise was the most invigorating of all, and long before the sun had  dried the dew from their clothes the men were marching with a freer  step.    This will show you how suddenly things may come upon the unwary in that  country. I had been riding with the scouts, two miles in advance of the  column, and we had just been examining through glasses a moving group in  the distance. It turned out to be nothing but cattle feeding--the only  moving things in a plain that seemed absolutely level, and I rode back  and rejoined the column. The Brigadier was just saying that he was  afraid we should see nothing to-day, when an orderly galloped up with a  note from Lord Chesham (who was out with the scouts on our left flank)  to say that the Boers were holding a kopje three miles on our left front  in strength.    Then began the excitement. Everyone was wide awake in a moment and  curious to see how the new Brigadier would manage his first job. The  convoy was halted, and the troops drawn on under cover of a slight and  almost imperceptible rise in the ground. Riding on in advance I suddenly  came on the scouts in action, that is to say, their horses were picketed  in rear of them, and they were lying hidden in the long grasses. And  there you have a typical picture of this kind of warfare. A row of men  lying on the ground, for no apparent reason, chewing the long stalks and  talking quietly to each other; in front a flat and seemingly vacant  ground; profound silence reigning everywhere. But use your glasses, and  you will see what looks like a shadow, but is really a rise on the  ground, giving advantage enough for the extermination of an army; show  your head, and you will hear the bang and whirr of the Mauser.    Presently the jingle of harness sounded behind me, and the guns went by  to take up a position on the left. I followed behind them in shelter of  the ridge, and therefore out of sight of the position. When I saw it  again I found that we were facing three long low mounds, running north  and south across our path, and the attack was now being developed. The  infantry, so dense a mass when marching, were now strung out in long  lines sweeping towards the left, and Lord Chesham with two squadrons had  also gone far to the left, to try to get round the position. Meanwhile  the guns were unlimbered, and their anxious crew (the battery had never  been in action before) were on tenter-hooks.    Up rides a staff officer. \"Shell that ridge on the left.\"    \"Right, sir. Sight for 1,800. Fuse six--no, six and a half,\" says the  nervous subaltern.    \"Fire, number one gun! Fire, number two gun!\" Then two shattering  explosions, the suspense of six seconds, the burst of shrapnel in the  air, the cloud of brown dust rising where it struck, and the hollow  \"boom\" coming back when all was over.    These exercises were repeated with much zeal by the subaltern and his  crew, until after about fifty rounds had been fired the order came to  cease fire; and it was afterwards ascertained that, as the net result of  this commotion, one partridge had been shot. But I know of another  result. A certain subaltern member of the Royal Regiment of Artillery  sat thereafter a little straighter on his horse than he had sat a week  ago.    But while the noise was going on, for all we knew, the Boers might be  suffering heavily from the shrapnel; although we rather thought not,  since no one "]]]
