The  Englishman does love to conceive himself as a sort of country gentleman;  and his castles in the air are all castles in Scotland rather than in  Spain. For, as an ideal, a Scotch castle is as English as a Welsh  rarebit or an Irish stew. And if he talks less about money I fear it is  sometimes because in one sense he thinks more of it. Money is a mystery  in the old and literal sense of something too sacred for speech. Gold is  a god; and like the god of some agnostics has no name and is worshipped  only in his works. It is true in a sense that the English gentleman  wishes to have enough money to be able to forget it. But it may be  questioned whether he does entirely forget it. As against this weakness  the American has succeeded, at the price of a great deal of crudity and  clatter, in making general a very real respect for work. He has partly  disenchanted the dangerous glamour of the gentleman, and in that sense  has achieved some degree of democracy; which is the most difficult  achievement in the world.    On the other hand, there is a good side to the Englishman's day-dream of  leisure, and one which the American spirit tends to miss. It may be  expressed in the word 'holiday' or still better in the word 'hobby.' The  Englishman, in his character of Robin Hood, really has got two strings  to his bow. Indeed the Englishman really is well represented by Robin  Hood; for there is always something about him that may literally be  called outlawed, in the sense of being extra-legal or outside the rules.  A Frenchman said of Browning that his centre was not in the middle; and  it may be said of many an Englishman that his heart is not where his  treasure is. Browning expressed a very English sentiment when he said:--           I like to know a butcher paints,       A baker rhymes for his pursuit,       Candlestick-maker much acquaints       His soul with song, or haply mute       Blows out his brains upon the flute.      Stevenson touched on the same insular sentiment when he said that many  men he knew, who were meat-salesmen to the outward eye, might in the  life of contemplation sit with the saints. Now the extraordinary  achievement of the American meat-salesman is that his poetic enthusiasm  can really be for meat sales; not for money but for meat. An American  commercial traveller asked me, with a religious fire in his eyes,  whether I did not think that salesmanship could be an art. In England  there are many salesmen who are sincerely fond of art; but seldom of the  art of salesmanship. Art is with them a hobby; a thing of leisure and  liberty. That is why the English traveller talks, if not of art, then of  sport. That is why the two city men in the London train, if they are not  talking about golf, may be talking about gardening. If they are not  talking about dollars, or the equivalent of dollars, the reason lies  much deeper than any superficial praise or blame touching the desire for  wealth. In the English case, at least, it lies very deep in the English  spirit. Many of the greatest English things have had this lighter and  looser character of a hobby or a holiday experiment. Even a masterpiece  has often been a by-product. The works of Shakespeare come out so  casually that they can be attributed to the most improbable people; even  to Bacon. The sonnets of Shakespeare are picked up afterwards as if out  of a wastepaper basket. The immortality of Dr. Johnson does not rest on  the written leaves he collected, but entirely on the words he wasted,  the words he scattered to the winds. So great a thing as Pickwick is  almost a kind of accident; it began as something secondary and grew into  something primary and pre-eminent. It began with mere words written to  illustrate somebody else's pictures; and swelled like an epic expanded  from an epigram. It might almost be said that in the case of Pickwick  the author began as the servant of the artist. But, as in the same story  of Pickwick, the servant became greater than the master. This  incalculable and accidental quality, like all national qualities, has  its strength and weakness; but it does represent a certain reserve fund  of interests in the Englishman's life; and distinguishes him from the  other extreme type, of the millionaire who works till he drops, or who  drops because he stops working. It is the great achievement of American  civilisation that in that country it really is not cant to talk about  the dignity of labour. There is something that might almost be called  the sanctity of labour; but it is subject to the profound law that when  anything less than the highest becomes a sanctity, it tends also to  become a superstition. When the candlestick-maker does not blow out his  brains upon the flute there is always a danger that he may blow them out  somewhere else, owing to depressed conditions in the candlestick market.    Now certainly one of the first impressions of America, or at any rate  of New York, which is by no means the same thing as America, is that of  a sort of mob of business men, behaving in many ways in a fashion very  different from that of the swarms of London city men who go up every day  to the city. They sit about in groups with Red-Indian gravity, as if  passing the pipe of peace; though, in fact, most of them are smoking  cigars and some of them are eating cigars. The latter strikes me as one  of the most peculiar of transatlantic tastes, more peculiar than that of  chewing gum. A man will sit for hours consuming a cigar as if it were a  sugar-stick; but I should imagine it to be a very disagreeable  sugar-stick. Why he attempts to enjoy a cigar without lighting it I do  not know; whether it is a more economical way of carrying a mere symbol  of commercial conversation; or whether something of the same queer  outlandish morality that draws such a distinction between beer and  ginger beer draws an equally ethical distinction between touching  tobacco and lighting it. For the rest, it would be easy to make a merely  external sketch full of things equally strange; for this can always be  done in a strange country. I allow for the fact of all foreigners  looking alike; but I fancy that all those hard-featured faces, with  spectacles and shaven jaws, do look rather alike, because they all like  to make their faces hard. And with the mention of their mental attitude  we realise the futility of any such external sketch. Unless we can see  that these are something more than men smoking cigars and talking about  dollars we had much better not see them at all.    It is customary to condemn the American as a materialist because of his  worship of success. But indeed this very worship, like any worship,  even devil-worship, proves him rather a mystic than a materialist. The  Frenchman who retires from business when he has money enough to drink  his wine and eat his omelette in peace might much more plausibly be  called a materialist by those who do not prefer to call him a man of  sense. But Americans do worship success in the abstract, as a sort of  ideal vision. They follow success rather than money; they follow money  rather than meat and drink. If their national life in one sense is a  perpetual game of poker, they are playing excitedly for chips or  counters as well as for coins. And by the ultimate test of material  enjoyment, like the enjoyment of an omelette, even a coin is itself a  counter. The Yankee cannot eat chips as the Frenchman can eat chipped  potatoes; but neither can he swallow red cents as the Frenchman swallows  red wine. Thus when people say of a Yankee that he worships the dollar,  they pay a compliment to his fine spirituality more true and delicate  than they imagine. The dollar is an idol because it is an image; but it  is an image of success and not of enjoyment.    That this romance is also a religion is shown in the fact that there is  a queer sort of morality attached to it. The nearest parallel to it is  something like the sense of honour in the old duelling days. There is  not a material but a distinctly moral savour about the implied  obligation to collect dollars or to collect chips. We hear too much in  England of the phrase about 'making good'; for no sensible Englishman  favours the needless interlarding of English with scraps of foreign  languages. But though it means nothing in English, it means something  very particular in American. There is a fine shade of distinction  between succeeding and making good, precisely because there must always  be a sort of ethical echo in the word good. America does vaguely feel a  man making good as something analogous to a man being good or a man  doing good. It is connected with his serious self-respect and his sense  of being worthy of those he loves. Nor is this curious crude idealism  wholly insincere even when it drives him to what some of us would call  stealing; any more than the duellist's honour was insincere when it  drove him to what some would call murder. A very clever American play  which I once saw acted contained a complete working model of this  morality. A girl was loyal to, but distressed by, her engagement to a  young man on whom there was a sort of cloud of humiliation. The  atmosphere was exactly what it would have been in England if he had been  accused of cowardice or card-sharping. And there was nothing whatever  the matter with the poor young man except that some rotten mine or other  in Arizona had not 'made good.' Now in England we should either be below  or above that ideal of good. If we were snobs, we should be content to  know that he was a gentleman of good connections, perhaps too much  accustomed to private means to be expected to be businesslike. If we  were somewhat larger-minded people, we should know that he might be as  wise as Socrates and as splendid as Bayard and yet be unfitted, perhaps  one should say therefore be unfitted, for the dismal and dirty gambling  of modern commerce.

The    transition has proven challenging as successive governments have    tried to deal with high unemployment, widespread corruption, a    dilapidated physical infrastructure, powerful organized crime    networks, and combative political opponents. Albania has made    progress in its democratic development since first holding    multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies remain. International    observers judged elections to be largely free and fair since the    restoration of political stability following the collapse of pyramid    schemes in 1997. In the 2005 general elections, the Democratic Party    and its allies won a decisive victory on pledges of reducing crime    and corruption, promoting economic growth, and decreasing the size    of government. The election, and particularly the orderly transition    of power, was considered an important step forward. Although    Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still one of the    poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy and an    inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure. Albania has    played a largely helpful role in managing inter-ethnic tensions in    southeastern Europe, and is continuing to work toward joining NATO    and the EU. Albania, with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been a    strong supporter of the global war on terrorism.
