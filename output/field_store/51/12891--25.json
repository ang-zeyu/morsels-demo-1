I'll race you again some day,\" declared Andy.    Mr. Damon enjoyed his visit at our hero's house, for Mrs. Baggert  cooked one of her best suppers for him.  Tom and the engineer spent the  evening repairing the motor-boat, Mr. Damon looking on and exclaiming  \"Bless my shoe leather\" or some other part of his dress or anatomy at  every stage of the work.  The engineer wanted to know all about the men  and their doings, but he could supply no reason for their queer actions  regarding the braces under the gasoline tank.    In the morning Tom once more prepared for an early start for Sandport,  and Mr. Damon, reconsidering his plans, rode as far with him as the  place where the automobile had been left.  There he took leave of the  young inventor, promising to call on Mr. Swift in the near future.    \"I hope you arrive at the hotel where your father is without any more  accidents,\" remarked the automobilist.  \"Bless my very existence, but  you seem to have the most remarkable series of adventures I ever heard  of!\"    \"They are rather odd,\" admitted Tom.  \"I don't know that I particularly  care for them, either.  But, now that I have my boat back, I guess  everything will be all right.\"    But Tom could not look ahead.  He was destined to have still more  exciting times, as presently will be related.    Without further incident he arrived at the Lakeview Hotel in Sandport  that evening and found his father and Ned very glad to see him.  Of  course he had to explain everything then, and, with his son safely in  his sight, Mr. Swift was not so nervous over the recital as he would  have been had Tom not been present.    \"Now for some nice, quiet trips,\" remarked the lad when he had finished  his account.  \"I feel as if I had cheated you out of part of your  vacation, Ned, staying away as long as I did.\"    \"Well, of course we missed you,\" answered his chum.  \"But your father  and I had a good time.\"    \"Yes, and I invented a new attachment for a kitchen boiler,\" added Mr.  Swift.  \"I had a chance for it when I passed through the hotel kitchen  one day, for I wanted to see what kind of a range they used.\"    \"I guess there's no stopping you from inventing,\" replied his son with  a laugh and a hopeless shake of the head.  \"But don't let it happen  again when you go away to rest.\"    \"Oh, I only just thought of it,\" said Mr. Swift.  \"I haven't worked the  details out yet.\"    Then he wanted to know about everything at home and he seemed  particularly anxious lest the Happy Harry gang do some damage.    \"I don't believe they will,\" Tom assured him.  \"Garret and Mrs. Baggert  will be on guard.\"    The next few days were pleasant ones for Tom, his father and Ned  Newton.  They cruised about the lake, went fishing and camped in the  woods.  Even Mr. Swift spent one night in the tent and said he liked it  very much.  For a week the three led an ideal existence, going about as  they pleased, Ned taking a number of photographs with his new camera.  The ARROW proved herself a fine boat, and Tom and Ned, when Mr. Swift  did not accompany them, explored the seldom visited parts of Lake  Carlopa.    The three had been out one day and were discussing the necessity of  returning home soon when Ned spoke.    \"I shall hate to give up this life and go to slaving in the bank  again,\" he complained.  \"I wish I was an inventor.\"    \"Oh, we inventors don't have such an easy time,\" said Mr. Swift.  \"You  never know when trouble is coming,\" and he little imagined how near the  truth he was.    A little later they were at the hotel dock.  When Tom had tied up his  boat the three walked up the path to the broad veranda that faced the  lake.  A boy in uniform met them.    \"Some one has just called you on the telephone, Mr. Swift,\" he reported.    \"Some one wants me?  Who is it?\"    \"I think he said his name is Jackson, sir, Garret Jackson, and he says  the message is very important.\"    \"Tom, something has happened at home!\" exclaimed the inventor as he  hurried up the steps.  \"I'm afraid there's bad news.\"    Unable to still the fear in his heart, Tom followed his father.          CHAPTER XX    NEWS OF A ROBBERY      With a hand that trembled so he could scarcely hold the receiver of the  telephone, Mr. Swift placed it to his ear.    \"Hello! Hello!\" he cried into the transmitter.  \"Yes, this is Mr.  Swift--yes, Garret.  What is it?\"    Then came a series of clicks, which Tom and Ned listened to.  The  inventor spoke again.    \"What's that?  The same men?  Broke in early this evening?  Oh, that's  too bad!  Of course, I'll come at once.\"    There followed more meaningless clicks, which Tom wished he could  translate.  His father hung up the receiver, turned to him and  exclaimed:    \"I've been robbed again!\"    \"Robbed again!  How, dad?\"    \"By that same rascally gang, Garret thinks.  This evening, when he and  Mrs. Baggert were in the house the burglar alarm went off.  The  indicator showed that the electrical shop had been entered, and the  engineer hurried there.  He saw a light inside and the shadows of  persons on the windows.  Before he could reach the shop, however, the  thieves heard him coming and escaped.  Oh, Tom, I should never have  come away!\"    \"But did they take anything, dad?  Perhaps Garret frightened them away  before they had a chance to steal any of your things.  Did you ask him  that?\"    \"I didn't need to.  He said he made a hasty exanimation before he  called me up, and he is sure a number of my electrical inventions are  missing.  Some of them are devices I never have had patented, and if I  lose them I will have no recovery.\"    \"But just what ones are they?  Perhaps we can send out a police alarm  to-night.\"    \"Garret couldn't tell that,\" answered Mr. Swift as he paced to and fro  in the hotel office.  \"He doesn't know all the tools and machinery I  had in there.  But it is certain that some of my most valuable things  have been taken.\"    \"Never mind.  Don't worry, dad,\" and Tom tried to speak soothingly, for  he saw that his father was much excited.  \"We may be able to get them  back.  How does Garret know the same men who stole the turbine model  broke in the shop this evening?\"    \"He saw them.  One was Happy Harry, he is positive.  The others he did  not know, but he recognized the tramp from our description of him.\"    \"Then we must tell the police at once.\"    \"Yes, Tom, I wish you would telephone.  I'll give you a description of  the things.  No, I can't do that either, for I don't know what was  stolen.  I must go home at once to find out.  It's a good thing the  motor-boat is here.  Come, let's start at once.  What is my bill here?\"  and the inventor turned to the hotel proprietor, who had come into the  office.  \"I have suffered a severe loss and must leave at once.\"    \"I am very sorry, sir.  I'll have it ready for you in a few minutes.\"    \"All right.  Tom, is your boat ready for a quick trip?\"    \"Yes, dad, but I don't like to make it at night with three in.  Of  course it might be perfectly safe, but there's a risk, and I don't like  to take it.\"    \"Don't worry about the risk on my account, Tom.  I'm not afraid.  I  must get home and see of what I have been robbed.\"    The young inventor was in a quandary.  He wanted to do as his father  requested and to aid him all he could, yet he knew that an all-night  trip in the boat down the lake would be dangerous, not only from the  chance of running on an unknown shore or into a hidden rock, but  because Mr. Swift was not physically fitted to stand the journey.    \"Come, Tom,\" exclaimed the aged inventor impatiently, \"we must start at  once!\"    \"Won't morning do as well, dad?\"    \"No, I must start now.  I could not sleep worrying over what has  happened.  We will start--\"    At that instant there came a low, rumbling peal of thunder.  Mr. Swift  started and peered from a window.  There came a flash of lightning and  another vibrant report from the storm-charged clouds.    \"There is your bill, Mr. Swift,\" remarked the proprietor, coming up,  \"but I would not advise you to start to-night.  There is a bad storm in  the west, and it will reach here in a few minutes.  Storms on Lake  Carlopa, especially at this open and exposed end, are not to be  despised, I assure you.\"    \"But I must get home!\" insisted Tom's father.    The lace curtain over the window blew almost straight out with a sudden  breeze, and a flash of lightning so bright that it reflected even in  the room where the incandescent electrics were glowing made several  others jump.  Then came a mighty crash, and with that the flood-gates  of the storm were opened, and the rain came down in torrents.  Tom  actually breathed a sigh of relief.  The problem was solved for him.  It would be impossible to start to-night, and he was glad of it, much  as he wanted to get on the trail of the thieves.    There was a scurrying on the part of the hotel attendants to close the  windows, and the guests who had been enjoying the air out on the  porches came running in.  With a rush, a roar and a muttering, as peal  after peal of thunder sounded, the deluge continued.    \"It's a good thing we didn't start,\" observed Ned.    \"I should say so,\" agreed Tom.  \"But we'll get off the first thing in  the morning, dad.\"    Mr. Swift did not reply, but his nervous pacing to and fro in the hotel  office showed how anxious he was to be at home again.  There was no  help for it, however, and, after a time, finding that to think of  reaching his house that night was out of the question, the inventor  calmed down somewhat.    The storm continued nearly all night, as Tom could bear witness, for he  did not sleep well, nor did his father.  And when he came down to  breakfast in the morning Mr. Swift plainly showed the effects of the  bad news.  His face was haggard and drawn and his eyes smarted and  burned from lack of sleep.    \"Well, Tom, we must start early,\" he said "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22748"],[0,"Explanation of Terms Used in Entomology (#19)"],[1,",  between the metapleura and pteropleura: the side of the  metasternum: the mesepimeron of the mesothorax.
