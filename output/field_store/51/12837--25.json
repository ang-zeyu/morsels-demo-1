[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#19)"],[1," Braid is stitched on to the bottom of a skirt with a narrow edge  showing, or it may be applied like the velveteen, with a doubled edge at  the bottom. The doubled edge will wear better.    [Sidenote: Finish of Wash Skirts]    Skirts that are to be washed and therefore which are very likely to  shrink must be finished at the bottom with a wide hem--at least six  inches--the fullness made by turning being disposed of carefully in  pleats or gathers.      [Illustration: APPLYING VELVETEEN BINDING]      If desired, the bias seam down the back of the skirt may have a narrow  woven tape or selvage of thin goods stitched in with the seam. This  strengthens the seam and prevents dragging. The skirt when finished  should always be longer in front than in the back.    All cloth dresses demand every detail of finish to make them complete  and able to stand hard usage, but simple house dresses and thin summer  dresses do not require such careful finish.      SHIRT WAISTS    [Sidenote: Trace Seams]    In planning a waist the same rules should be observed in placing  patterns, etc., as described for skirts, except that the lines and seams  should be traced with a tracing wheel or marked carefully. In making a  waist of any kind care must be taken to cut all the pieces the proper  way of the material.    [Sidenote: Baste Lavishly]    The difficulty of putting garments together after they have been cut  properly is due to undue haste, lack of care in details and insufficient  pressing. The apparently simple act of basting is really of primal  importance, particularly in the making of a waist. One need never be  afraid of basting too much or too carefully. Economize cloth and time in  cutting, but use basting lavishly.    [Sidenote: Altering Waist Patterns]    The waist pattern may be made shorter by laying folds across both back  and front. The fold across the back should be two inches above the waist  line and across the front two inches below the arm's eye (in the back).  Securely pin or baste the folds in the pattern. If the pattern is of  nearly the correct size it may be only necessary to make the waist  shorter and smaller. The neck and arm's eye will seldom need altering.  The sleeves may be shortened in the same way by laying folds in the  pattern, above and below the elbow.    PLAN FOR MAKING A SHIRT WAIST         After the waist is cut, remove and care for the patterns.       Make the sleeves, cuffs and collar band first.       Make box plait on right or left side as liked by the wearer and hem         on the other side or face.       Baste shoulders and under-arm seams.       Try on the waist, making all changes necessary by enlarging or         taking up seams.       Pin for neck band and mark for seams.       Fit sleeves and mark places for seams.       Arrange fullness and place tape at back of waist line.    [Sidenote: Making Plain Sleeve]    If the pattern is for a plain, one-seam sleeve with the cuff opening at  the end of the seam, hem each side of the opening one or two inches from  the bottom, gather the bottom between the notches, lay the gathers,  baste the right side of the sleeve band or cuff to the wrong side of the  sleeve, stitch and _press_, fold in a hem on all edges of the cuff, fold  the cuff over on the wrong side of the sleeve, baste, oversew the ends  of the cuff, _press_ and stitch the cuff close to all edges. After thus  attaching the cuff, baste and stitch the long seam of the sleeve and  gather at the top between notches. The cuff is usually cut in the  direction of the warp of the goods.    The sleeve described is the simplest that can be made. If the sleeve is  to open at the back and finished with a tape, with a placket, strap or  fancy lap, the seam in the sleeve is stitched first and the cuff  afterward adjusted.      [Illustration: PLAIN SLEEVE WITH CUFF, SHOWING GENERAL METHODS OF SEWING  ON BANDS]      The box plait is made if desired and the under arm and shoulder seams  basted when the shirt waist is ready to try on. Make any change in the  seams necessary. The neck band is put on in the same way as the cuffs,  sleeves sewed in, fullness arranged at the back and a tape placed at the  waist line. Three hooks or other fastenings should always be placed at  the back to attach to corresponding fastenings in the skirt band. The  bottom edge of the waist may be finished by overcasting.    [Sidenote: Bottom Finish]    If it is desired to have the fullness cut away at the waist line in  front, determine the length, allowing sufficient for a blouse, gather  the waist at the bottom and sew the fullness on to a band. Sometimes  this band is carried entirely around the waist.    [Sidenote: Fit of Collar]    The fit of the collar or neck band is very important in any kind of a  waist. Both the front and the back may be cut higher than the pattern,  as it is easy to cut off in adjusting and more goods cannot be added.    To the unskilled the simplest garment is sufficiently difficult. It is  wiser to make two or three perfectly plain garments before attempting to  make an elaborate one.    After the pattern has been tested, fitted and all necessary changes  made, cut a pattern from the fitted waist of cambric or cheap _new_  muslin and mark or trace all seams. (Never use old, worn-out sheets from  which to cut a pattern.) After this permanent pattern has been made, do  not change a single line.    [Sidenote: Tucked Waist]    [Sidenote: Full Busted Waist]    If a plaited or tucked waist is to be made, all plaiting and tucking  should be done first, after which the same order of making is to be  followed for a plain waist. No waist should draw or strain across the  bust. This is especially important in tucked or pleated waists. To guard  against this tendency, a graduated tuck can be pinned on either side of  the front, beginning with nothing at the shoulders and widening at the  waist line. This is done before the pattern is cut and will allow for  especially full bust. The fold should be _on a thread_ of the goods.      LINED WAISTS    The plain, closely fitted, lined waist, with the curved back and side  forms is the most difficult to make and requires the greatest nicety in  handling from beginning to finish.      [Illustration: TYPICAL BODICE PATTERNS    (_a_) Front. (_b_) Under Arm Piece. (_c_) Side of Back. (_d_) Back.  (_e_) Collar. (_f_) Outside Sleeve. (_g_) Inside Sleeve.]      The pattern for a bodice of this kind should be of such a shape that in  each part the woof threads will go as straight around the waist as  possible. This makes the warp threads perpendicular and will give almost  a perfect bias on the current seams in the back. Do _not_ cut the side  forms out of _any_ piece that is big enough, without regard to the warp  and woof threads. If this is done, the threads in each will run  differently and all ways but the right one. In a well-designed pattern  the back forms should be nearly as wide at the arm's eye as they are at  the waist line. The swell of bust and shoulders should be accommodated  by the back and front forms.    When material is to be cut on the bias be careful to have a _true_ bias  (the diagonal of a square) around the waist and up the front and back  seams.    PLAN FOR MAKING FITTED, LINED WAIST.         Pin pattern to lining, cut out trace seams.       Baste all seams on traced lines.       Try on lining. Make changes.       Rip lining, baste on outside and cut by fitted lining.       Baste seams and try on. Make changes if necessary.       Mark the turn for hem down the front, face and mark for fastenings.       Stitch and finish seams. Put on featherbone.       Put on collar; sew in sleeves.       Finish.    [Sidenote: Finish Lining First]    In making a lined waist, the lining is cut, basted, and fitted before  the outside is cut. After fitting, the lining is ripped apart and the  outside cut by it. For all firm, heavy materials the lining should be  slightly fuller than the outside, that is, the dress goods should be  well stretched over the lining, just as in a lined skirt, and basted  closely and evenly, the warp and the woof threads of the outside and  lining corresponding.    In laying the pattern for cutting the lining, just as much attention  should be paid to the direction of the threads as in cutting a striped  or figured goods.    [Sidenote: Marking Seams]    All seams should be traced on the lining with the tracing wheel, with a  slow backward and forward movement, making the perforations clear and  distinct. Soft spongy goods that cannot be traced may be marked with a  line of basting, tailor's chalk or by taking stitches with a pin along  the line to be marked and twisting them in the goods. This will make  holes that can be seen, but the twisting does not harm the goods. Always  trace or mark the waist line, as this is the starting point from which  to pin or baste. Bodice seams should never be begun at the top or  bottom, but at the marks or notches that show the waist line, working  towards the top and bottom.    After the lining is cut out, the seams should be basted exactly along  the traced lines, with seams out, when it is ready to be tried on.    [Sidenote: Making Changes in Straight Seams]    If the pattern has been cut or drafted by the correct bust measure, the  back seams should never be changed. If possible, make all changes  required by letting out or taking in on the straight under-arm seams,  leaving the curved ones and the darts untouched.    [Sidenote: Pinning and Basting]    Pins should be used plentifully while the fitting is being done, but  they should be replaced with regular basting as soon as they are  removed. Do not be afraid of taking up fullness in the lining by darts  crosswise at the top of the corset or where the fullness naturally falls  in front or back. Such darts should be basted, stitched and pressed  flat. If the lining is too short, it may be lengthened by letting out  the shoulder seams.

If  there is any taste for ingenuity left in a degenerate age, fast sinking  into barbarism, this artist, I apprehend, will make a capital figure, as  soon as his works are known.    Two days ago, I was favoured with a visit by Mr Fitzowen; who, with  great formality, solicited my vote and interest at the general election.  I ought not to have been shocked at the confidence of this man; though  it was remarkable, considering what had passed between him and me on a  former occasion--These visits are mere matter of form, which a candidate  makes to every elector; even to those who, he knows, are engaged in  the interest of his competitor, lest he should expose himself to the  imputation of pride, at a time when it is expected he should appear  humble. Indeed, I know nothing so abject as the behaviour of a  man canvassing for a seat in parliament--This mean prostration (to  borough-electors, especially) has, I imagine, contributed in a great  measure to raise that spirit of insolence among the vulgar; which, like  the devil, will be found very difficult to lay. Be that as it may, I was  in some confusion at the effrontery of Fitzowen; but I soon recollected  myself, and told him, I had not yet determined for whom I should give my  vote, nor whether I should give it for any.--The truth is, I look upon  both candidates in the same light; and should think myself a traitor to  the constitution of my country, if I voted for either. If every elector  would bring the same consideration home to his conscience, we should not  have such reason to exclaim against the venality of p--ts. But we all  are a pack of venal and corrupted rascals; so lost to all sense of  honesty, and all tenderness of character, that, in a little time, I am  fully persuaded, nothing will be infamous but virtue and public-spirit.    G. H--, who is really an enthusiast in patriotism, and represented the  capital in several successive parliaments, declared to me t'other day,  with the tears in his eyes, that he had lived above thirty years in the  city of London, and dealt in the way of commerce with all the citizens  of note in their turns; but that, as he should answer to God, he had  never, in the whole course of his life, found above three or four  whom he could call thoroughly honest: a declaration which was rather  mortifying than surprising to me; who have found so few men of worth  in the course of my acquaintance, that they serve only as exceptions;  which, in the grammarian's phrase, confirm and prove a general canon--I  know you will say, G. H-- saw imperfectly through the mist of prejudice,  and I am rankled by the spleen--Perhaps, you are partly in the right;  for I have perceived that my opinion of mankind, like mercury in the  thermometer, rises and falls according to the variations of the weather.    Pray settle accompts with Barnes; take what money of mine is in his  hands, and give him acquittance. If you think Davis has stock or credit  enough to do justice to the farm, give him a discharge for the rent that  is due, this will animate his industry; for I know that nothing is so  discouraging to a farmer as the thoughts of being in arrears with his  landlord. He becomes dispirited, and neglects his labour; and so the  farm goes to wreck. Tabby has been clamouring for some days about the  lamb's skin, which Williams, the hind, begged of me, when he was last at  Bath.

DOCTER LEWS,    Give me leaf to tell you, methinks you mought employ your talons better,  than to encourage servants to pillage their masters. I find by Gwyllim,  that Villiams has got my skin; for which he is an impotent rascal. He  has not only got my skin, but, moreover, my butter-milk to fatten his  pigs; and, I suppose, the next thing he gets, will be my pad to carry  his daughter to church and fair: Roger gets this, and Roger gets  that; but I'd have you to know, I won't be rogered at this rate by any  ragmatical fellow in the kingdom--And I am surprised, docter Lews, you  would offer to put my affairs in composition with the refuge and skim  of the hearth.

As for the butter-milk, ne'er a pig in the parish  shall thrust his snout in it, with my good-will.

I'll have our butter-milk  barrelled up, and sent twice a-week to Aberginny, where it may be sold  for a half-penny the quart; and so Roger may carry his pigs to another  market--I hope, Docter, you will not go to put any more such phims in my  brother's head, to the prejudice of my pockat; but rather give me some  raisins (which hitherto you have not done) to subscribe myself    Your humble servant, TAB. BRAMBLE BATH, May 19.          To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.    DEAR PHILLIPS,    Without waiting for your answer to my last, I proceed to give you an  account of our journey to London, which has not been wholly barren of  adventure. Tuesday last the 'squire took his place in a hired coach and  four, accompanied by his sister and mine, and Mrs Tabby's maid, Winifrid  Jenkins, whose province it was to support Chowder on a cushion in  her lap. I could scarce refrain from laughing when I looked into the  vehicle, and saw that animal sitting opposite to my uncle, like any  other passenger. The squire, ashamed of his situation, blushed to the  eyes: and, calling to the postilions to drive on, pulled the glass up in  my face. I, and his servant, John Thomas, attended them on horseback.    Nothing worth mentioning occurred, till we arrived on the edge of  Marlborough Downs. There one of the four horses fell, in going down  hill at a round trot; and the postilion behind, endeavouring to stop  the carriage, pulled it on one side into a deep rut, where it was fairly  overturned. I had rode on about two hundred yards before; but, hearing  a loud scream, galloped back and dismounted, to give what assistance  was in my power. When I looked into the coach, I could see nothing  distinctly, but the nether end of Jenkins, who was kicking her heels and  squalling with great vociferation. All of a sudden, my uncle thrust  up his bare pate, and bolted through the window, as nimble as a  grasshopper, having made use of poor Win's posteriors as a step to rise  in his ascent--The man (who had likewise quitted his horse) dragged this  forlorn damsel, more dead than alive, through the same opening. Then  Mr Bramble, pulling the door off its hinges with a jerk, laid hold  on Liddy's arm, and brought her to the light; very much frighted, but  little hurt. It fell to my share to deliver our aunt Tabitha, who had  lost her cap in the struggle, and being rather more than half frantic,  with rage and terror, was no bad representation of one of the sister  Furies that guard the gates of hell--She expressed no sort of concern  for her brother, who ran about in the cold, without his periwig, and  worked with the most astonishing agility, in helping to disentangle  the horses from the carriage: but she cried, in a tone of distraction,  'Chowder! Chowder! my dear Chowder! my poor Chowder is certainly  killed!'    This was not the case--Chowder, after having tore my uncle's leg in the  confusion of the fall, had retreated under the scat, and from thence the  footman drew him by the neck; for which good office, he bit his fingers  to the bone. The fellow, who is naturally surly, was so provoked at this  assault, that he saluted his ribs with a hearty kick, exclaiming, 'Damn  the nasty son of a bitch, and them he belongs to!' A benediction,  which was by no means lost upon the implacable virago his mistress--Her  brother, however, prevailed upon her to retire into a peasant's house,  near the scene of action, where his head and hers were covered, and poor  Jenkins had a fit. Our next care was to apply some sticking plaister to  the wound in his leg, which exhibited the impression of Chowder's teeth;  but he never opened his lips against the delinquent--Mrs Tabby, alarmed  at this scene, 'You say nothing, Matt (cried she); but I know your  mind--I know the spite you have to that poor unfortunate animal! I know  you intend to take his life away!' 'You are mistaken, upon my honour!  (replied the squire, with a sarcastic smile) I should be incapable  of harbouring any such cruel design against an object so amiable and  inoffensive; even if he had not the happiness to be your favourite.'    John Thomas was not so delicate. The fellow, whether really alarmed for  his life, or instigated by the desire of revenge, came in, and bluntly  demanded, that the "]]]
