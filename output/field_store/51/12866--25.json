This street is the only original long lane that has  no turning; and the houses on both sides are shut up.... I could only  suppose that you'd seen somebody coming whom you didn't want to meet;  and found the public-house was the only shelter in this wilderness  of stone.... I don't think I went beyond the licence of a stranger  in glancing at the only man who passed immediately after.... And as I  thought he looked like the wrong sort... and you looked like the right  sort.... I held myself ready to help if he annoyed you; that is all.  As for my friend, he'll be back soon; and he certainly can't find out  anything by stumping down a road like this.... I didn't think he could.\"    \"Then why did you send him out?\" she cried, leaning forward with yet  warmer curiosity. She had the proud, impetuous face that goes with  reddish colouring, and a Roman nose, as it did in Marie Antoinette.    He looked at her steadily for the first time, and said: \"Because I hoped  you would speak to me.\"    She looked back at him for some time with a heated face, in which there  hung a red shadow of anger; then, despite her anxieties, humour broke  out of her eyes and the corners of her mouth, and she answered almost  grimly: \"Well, if you're so keen on my conversation, perhaps you'll  answer my question.\" After a pause she added: \"I had the honour to ask  you why you thought the man's nose was false.\"    \"The wax always spots like that just a little in this weather,\" answered  Father Brown with entire simplicity.    \"But it's such a crooked nose,\" remonstrated the red-haired girl.    The priest smiled in his turn. \"I don't say it's the sort of nose one  would wear out of mere foppery,\" he admitted. \"This man, I think, wears  it because his real nose is so much nicer.\"    \"But why?\" she insisted.    \"What is the nursery-rhyme?\" observed Brown absent-mindedly. \"There was  a crooked man and he went a crooked mile.... That man, I fancy, has gone  a very crooked road--by following his nose.\"    \"Why, what's he done?\" she demanded, rather shakily.    \"I don't want to force your confidence by a hair,\" said Father Brown,  very quietly. \"But I think you could tell me more about that than I can  tell you.\"    The girl sprang to her feet and stood quite quietly, but with clenched  hands, like one about to stride away; then her hands loosened slowly,  and she sat down again. \"You are more of a mystery than all the others,\"  she said desperately, \"but I feel there might be a heart in your  mystery.\"    \"What we all dread most,\" said the priest in a low voice, \"is a maze  with no centre. That is why atheism is only a nightmare.\" \"I will tell  you everything,\" said the red-haired girl doggedly, \"except why I am  telling you; and that I don't know.\"    She picked at the darned table-cloth and went on: \"You look as if you  knew what isn't snobbery as well as what is; and when I say that ours  is a good old family, you'll understand it is a necessary part of the  story; indeed, my chief danger is in my brother's high-and-dry notions,  noblesse oblige and all that. Well, my name is Christabel Carstairs; and  my father was that Colonel Carstairs you've probably heard of, who made  the famous Carstairs Collection of Roman coins. I could never describe  my father to you; the nearest I can say is that he was very like a Roman  coin himself. He was as handsome and as genuine and as valuable and as  metallic and as out-of-date. He was prouder of his Collection than of  his coat-of-arms--nobody could say more than that. His extraordinary  character came out most in his will. He had two sons and one daughter.  He quarrelled with one son, my brother Giles, and sent him to Australia  on a small allowance. He then made a will leaving the Carstairs  Collection, actually with a yet smaller allowance, to my brother Arthur.  He meant it as a reward, as the highest honour he could offer, in  acknowledgement of Arthur's loyalty and rectitude and the distinctions  he had already gained in mathematics and economics at Cambridge. He left  me practically all his pretty large fortune; and I am sure he meant it  in contempt.    \"Arthur, you may say, might well complain of this; but Arthur is my  father over again. Though he had some differences with my father in  early youth, no sooner had he taken over the Collection than he became  like a pagan priest dedicated to a temple. He mixed up these Roman  halfpence with the honour of the Carstairs family in the same stiff,  idolatrous way as his father before him. He acted as if Roman money  must be guarded by all the Roman virtues. He took no pleasures; he spent  nothing on himself; he lived for the Collection. Often he would not  trouble to dress for his simple meals; but pattered about among the  corded brown-paper parcels (which no one else was allowed to touch) in  an old brown dressing-gown. With its rope and tassel and his pale, thin,  refined face, it made him look like an old ascetic monk. Every now  and then, though, he would appear dressed like a decidedly fashionable  gentleman; but that was only when he went up to the London sales or  shops to make an addition to the Carstairs Collection.    \"Now, if you've known any young people, you won't be shocked if I say  that I got into rather a low frame of mind with all this; the frame of  mind in which one begins to say that the Ancient Romans were all very  well in their way. I'm not like my brother Arthur; I can't help enjoying  enjoyment. I got a lot of romance and rubbish where I got my red hair,  from the other side of the family. Poor Giles was the same; and I think  the atmosphere of coins might count in excuse for him; though he really  did wrong and nearly went to prison. But he didn't behave any worse than  I did; as you shall hear.    \"I come now to the silly part of the story. I think a man as clever as  you can guess the sort of thing that would begin to relieve the monotony  for an unruly girl of seventeen placed in such a position. But I am so  rattled with more dreadful things that I can hardly read my own feeling;  and don't know whether I despise it now as a flirtation or bear it as a  broken heart. We lived then at a little seaside watering-place in South  Wales, and a retired sea-captain living a few doors off had a son about  five years older than myself, who had been a friend of Giles before he  went to the Colonies. His name does not affect my tale; but I tell you  it was Philip Hawker, because I am telling you everything. We used to  go shrimping together, and said and thought we were in love with each  other; at least he certainly said he was, and I certainly thought I was.  If I tell you he had bronzed curly hair and a falconish sort of face,  bronzed by the sea also, it's not for his sake, I assure you, but for  the story; for it was the cause of a very curious coincidence.    \"One summer afternoon, when I had promised to go shrimping along  the sands with Philip, I was waiting rather impatiently in the front  drawing-room, watching Arthur handle some packets of coins he had just  purchased and slowly shunt them, one or two at a time, into his own dark  study and museum which was at the back of the house. As soon as I heard  the heavy door close on him finally, I made a bolt for my shrimping-net  and tam-o'-shanter and was just going to slip out, when I saw that my  brother had left behind him one coin that lay gleaming on the long bench  by the window. It was a bronze coin, and the colour, combined with the  exact curve of the Roman nose and something in the very lift of the  long, wiry neck, made the head of Caesar on it the almost precise  portrait of Philip Hawker. Then I suddenly remembered Giles telling  Philip of a coin that was like him, and Philip wishing he had it.  Perhaps you can fancy the wild, foolish thoughts with which my head went  round; I felt as if I had had a gift from the fairies. It seemed to me  that if I could only run away with this, and give it to Philip like a  wild sort of wedding-ring, it would be a bond between us for ever; I  felt a thousand such things at once. Then there yawned under me, like  the pit, the enormous, awful notion of what I was doing; above all, the  unbearable thought, which was like touching hot iron, of what Arthur  would think of it. A Carstairs a thief; and a thief of the Carstairs  treasure! I believe my brother could see me burned like a witch for such  a thing, But then, the very thought of such fanatical cruelty heightened  my old hatred of his dingy old antiquarian fussiness and my longing for  the youth and liberty that called to me from the sea. Outside was strong  sunlight with a wind; and a yellow head of some broom or gorse in the  garden rapped against the glass of the window. I thought of that living  and growing gold calling to me from all the heaths of the world--and  then of that dead, dull gold and bronze and brass of my brother's  growing dustier and dustier as life went by. Nature and the Carstairs  Collection had come to grips at last.    \"Nature is older than the Carstairs Collection. As I ran down the  streets to the sea, the coin clenched tight in my fist, I felt all the  Roman Empire on my back as well as the Carstairs pedigree. It was not  only the old lion argent that was roaring in my ear, but all the eagles  of the Caesars seemed flapping and screaming in pursuit of me. And yet  my heart rose higher and higher like a child's kite, until I came over  the loose, dry sand-hills and to the flat, wet sands, where Philip stood  already up to his ankles in the shallow shining water, some hundred  yards out to sea. There was a great red sunset; and the long stretch of  low water, hardly rising over the ankle for half a mile, was like a lake  of ruby flame. It was not till I had torn off my shoes and stockings and  waded to where he stood, which was well away from the dry land, that I  turned and looked round. We were quite alone in a circle of sea-water  and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22305"],[0,"The Naval History of the United States. Volume 1 (#19)"],[1,"the spreading sails. Then the waves rippled about the  bow of the ship, and the \"Ranger\" was fairly under way.    It was a pitch-dark night, but the lights on board the \"Drake\" showed  where she was lying. On the \"Ranger\" all lights were extinguished, and  no noise told of her progress towards her enemy. It was the captain's  plan to run his vessel across the \"Drake's\" cable, drop his own  anchor, let the \"Ranger\" swing alongside the Englishman, and then  fight it out at close quarters. But this plan, though well laid,  failed of execution. The anchor was not let fall in season; and the  \"Ranger,\" instead of bringing up alongside her enemy, came to anchor  half a cable-length astern. The swift-flowing tide and the fresh  breeze made it impossible to warp the ship alongside: so Jones ordered  the cable cut, and the \"Ranger\" scudded down the bay before the  ever-freshening gale. It does not appear that the people on the  \"Drake\" were aware of the danger they so narrowly escaped.    The wind that had aided the tide in defeating Jones's enterprise blew  stronger and stronger, and before morning the sea was tossing before a  regular north-east gale. Against it the \"Ranger\" could make no  headway: so Jones gave his ship her head, and scudded before the wind  until within the vicinity of Whitehaven, when he determined to again  attempt to destroy the shipping in that port. This time he was  successful. Bringing the \"Ranger\" to anchor near the bar, Capt. Jones  called for volunteers to accompany him on the expedition. He himself  was to be their leader; for as a boy he had often sailed in and out of  the little harbor, knew where the forts stood, and where the colliers  anchored most thickly. The landing party was divided into two  boat-loads; Jones taking command of one, while Lieut. Wallingford held  the tiller of the other boat. With muffled oars the Americans made for  the shore, the boats' keels grated upon the pebbly shore, and an  instant later the adventurers had scaled the ramparts of the forts,  and had made themselves masters of the garrisons. All was done  quietly. The guns in the fortifications were spiked; and, leaving the  few soldiers on guard gagged and bound, Jones and his followers  hastened down to the wharves to set fire to the shipping.    In the harbor were not less than two hundred and twenty vessels, large  and small. On the north side of the harbor, near the forts, were about  one hundred and fifty vessels. These Jones undertook to destroy. The  others were left to Lieut. Wallingford, with his boat's crew of  fifteen picked men.    When Jones and his followers reached the cluster of merchantmen, they  found their torches so far burned out as to be useless. Failure stared  them in the face then, when success was almost within their grasp.  Jones, however, was not to be balked of his prey. Running his boat  ashore, he hastened to a neighboring house, where he demanded candles.  With these he returned, led his men aboard a large ship from which the  crew fled, and deliberately built a fire in her hold. Lest the fire  should go out, he found a barrel of tar, and threw it upon the flames.  Then with the great ship roaring and crackling, and surrounded by  scores of other vessels in danger from the flames, Jones withdrew,  thinking his work complete.    Many writers have criticised Paul Jones for not having stayed longer  to complete the destruction of the vessels in the harbor. But, with  the gradually brightening day, his position, which was at the best  very dangerous, was becoming desperate. There were one hundred and  fifty vessels in that part of the harbor; the crews averaged ten men  to a vessel: so that nearly fifteen hundred men were opposed to the  plucky little band of Americans. The roar of the fire aroused the  people of the town, and they rushed in crowds to the wharf. In  describing the affair Jones writes, \"The inhabitants began to appear  in thousands, and individuals ran hastily toward us. I stood between  them and the ship on fire, with my pistol in my hand, and ordered them  to stand, which they did with some precipitation. The sun was a full  hour's march above the horizon; and, as sleep no longer ruled the  world, it was time to retire. We re-embarked without opposition,  having released a number of prisoners, as our boats could not carry  them. After all my people had embarked, I stood upon the pier for a  considerable space, yet no person advanced. I saw all the eminences  round the town covered with the amazed inhabitants.\"    As his boat drew away from the blazing shipping, Jones looked  anxiously across the harbor to the spot to which Lieut. Wallingford  had been despatched. But no flames were seen in that quarter; for,  Wallingford's torches having gone out, he had abandoned the  enterprise. And so the Americans, having regained their ship, took  their departure, leaving only one of the enemy's vessels burning. A  most lame and impotent conclusion it was indeed; but, as Jones said,  \"What was done is sufficient to show that not all the boasted British  navy is sufficient to protect their own coasts, and that the scenes of  distress which they have occasioned in America may soon be brought  home to their own doors.\"          CHAPTER VII.         CAREER OF PAUL JONES CONTINUED. -- HIS DESCENT UPON THE       CASTLE OF LORD SELKIRK -- THE AFFAIR OF THE PLATE. -- THE       DESCENT UPON WHITEHAVEN. -- THE BATTLE WITH THE       \"DRAKE.\"-LIEUT. SIMPSON'S PERFIDY.      We now come to the glorious part of the career of Paul Jones upon the  ocean. Heretofore he has been chiefly occupied in the capture of  defenceless merchantmen. His work has been that of the privateer, even  if not of the pirate that the British have always claimed he was. But  the time came when Jones proved that he was ready to fight an  adversary of his mettle; was willing to take heavy blows, and deal  stunning ones in return. His daring was not confined to dashing  expeditions in which the danger was chiefly overcome by spirit and  rapid movements. While this class of operations was ever a favorite  with the doughty seaman, he was not at all averse to the deadly naval  duel.    We shall for a time abandon our account of the general naval incidents  of the Revolution, to follow the career of Paul Jones to the end of  the war. His career is not only the most interesting, but the most  important, feature of the naval operations of that war. He stands out  alone, a grand figure in naval history, as does Decatur in the wars  with the Barbary pirates, or Farragut in the war for the Union. The  war of 1812 affords no such example of single greatness in the navy.  There we find Perry, McDonough, and Porter, all equally great. But in  '76 there was no one to stand beside Paul Jones.    When the \"Ranger\" left the harbor of Whitehaven, her captain was heavy  hearted. He felt that he had had the opportunity to strike a heavy  blow at the British shipping, but had nevertheless inflicted only a  trifling hurt. Angry with himself for not having better planned the  adventure, and discontented with his lieutenant for not having by  presence of mind prevented the fiasco, he felt that peace of mind  could only be obtained by some deed of successful daring.    He was cruising in seas familiar to him as a sailor. Along the  Scottish shores his boyhood hours had been spent. This knowledge he  sought to turn to account. From the deck of his ship, he could see the  wooded shores of St. Mary's Island, on which were the landed estates  of Lord Selkirk, a British noble, of ancient lineage and political  prominence. On the estate of this nobleman Paul Jones was born, and  there he passed the few years of his life that elapsed before he  forsook the land for his favorite element.    Leaning against the rail on the quarter-deck of the \"Ranger,\" Jones  could see through his spy-glass the turrets and spires of Lord  Selkirk's castle. As he gazed, there occurred to him the idea, that if  he could send a landing party ashore, seize the castle, capture the  peer, and bear him off into captivity, he would not only strike terror  into the hearts of the British, but would give the Americans a  prisoner who would serve as a hostage to secure good treatment for the  hapless Americans who had fallen into the hands of the enemy.    With Jones, the conception of a plan was followed by its swift  execution. Disdaining to wait for nightfall, he chose two boats' crews  of tried and trusty men, and landed. The party started up the broad  and open highway leading to the castle. They had gone but a few rods,  however, when they encountered two countrymen, who stared a moment at  the force of armed men, and then turned in fear to escape.    \"Halt!\" rang out the clear voice of the leader of the blue-jackets;  and the peasants fell upon their faces in abject terror. Jones  directed that they be brought to him; and he questioned them kindly,  setting their minds at rest, and learning from them much of the castle  and its inmates. Lord Selkirk was away from home. This to Jones was  bitter news. It seemed as though some evil genius was dogging his  footsteps, bringing failure upon his most carefully planned  enterprises. But he was not a man to repine over the inevitable, and  he promptly ordered his men to the right about, and made for the  landing-place again.    But the sailors were not so unselfish in their motives as their  captain. They had come ashore expecting to plunder the castle of the  earl, and they now murmured loudly over the abandonment of the  adventure. They saw the way clear before them. No guards protected the  house. The massive ancestral plate, with which all English landed  families are well provided, was unprotected by bolts or bars. They  felt that, in retreating, they were throwing away a chance to despoil  their enemy, and enrich themselves.    Jones felt the justice of the complaint of the sailors; but only after  a fierce"]]]
