Taggi joined his mate on the ground and both wolverines padded about the  dome, obviously baffled. Now and then they assaulted the shell with a  testing paw. Claws raked and did not leave any marks but shallow  scratches. They could continue that forever, as far as Shann could see,  without solving the problem in the least.    He sat back on his heels and studied the scene in detail. The excavation  holding the shelled creature was some three yards above the high-water  mark, with a few more feet separating that from the point where lazy  waves now washed the finer sand. Shann watched the slow inward slip of  those waves with growing interest. Where their combined efforts had  failed to win this odd battle, perhaps the sea itself could now be  pressed into service.    Shann began his own excavation, a trough to lead from the waterline to  the pit occupied by the obstinate shell. Of course the thing living in  or under that covering might be only too familiar with salt water. But  it had placed its burrow, or hiding place, above the reach of the waves  and so might be disconcerted by the sudden appearance of water in its  bed. However, the scheme was worth trying, and he went to work doggedly,  wishing he could make the wolverines understand so they would help him.    They still prowled about their captive, scrapping at the sand about the  shell casing. At least their efforts would keep the half-prisoner  occupied and prevent its escape. Shann put another piece of his raft to  work as a shovel, throwing up a shower of sand and gravel while sweat  dampened his tattered blouse and was salt and sticky on his arms and  face.    He finished his trench, one which ran at an angle he hoped would feed  water into the pit rapidly once he knocked away the last barrier against  the waves. And, splashing out into the green water, he did just that.    His calculations proved correct. Waves lapped, then flowed in a rapidly  thickening stream, puddling out about the shell as the wolverines drew  back, snarling. Shann lashed his knife fast to a stout length of  sapling, so equipping himself with a spear. He stood with it ready in  his hand, not knowing just what to expect. And when the answer to his  water attack came, the move was so sudden that in spite of his  preparation he was caught gaping.    For the shell fairly erupted out of the mess of sand and water. A  complete fringe of jointed, clawed brown limbs churned in a  forward-and-upward dash. But the water worked to frustrate that charge.  For one of the pit walls crumbled, over-balancing the creature so that  the fore end of the shell lifted from the ground, the legs clawing  wildly at the air.    Shann thrust with the spear, feeling the knife point go home so deeply  that he could not pull his improvised weapon free. A limb snapped claws  only inches away from his leg as he pushed down on the haft with all his  strength. That attack along with the initial upset of balance did the  job. The shell flopped over, its rounded hump now embedded in the watery  sand of the pit while the frantic struggles of the creature to right  itself only buried it the deeper.    The Terran stared down upon a segmented under belly where legs were  paired in riblike formation. Shann could locate no head, no good target.  But he drew his stunner and beamed at either end of the oval, and then,  for good measure, in the middle, hoping in one of those three general  blasts to contact the thing's central nervous system. He was not to know  which of those shots did the trick, but the frantic wiggling of the legs  slowed and finally ended, as a clockwork toy might run down for want of  winding--and at last projected, at crooked angles, completely still. The  shell creature might not be dead, but it was tamed for now.    Taggi had only been waiting for a good chance to do battle. He grabbed  one of those legs, worried it, and then leaped to tear at the under  body. Unlike the outer shell, this portion of the creature had no proper  armor and the wolverine plunged joyfully into the business of the kill,  his mate following suit.    The process of butchery was a bloody, even beastly job, and Shann was  shaken before it was complete. But he kept at his labors, determined to  have that shell, his one chance of escape from the Island. The  wolverines feasted on the greenish-white flesh, but he could not bring  himself to sample it, climbing to the heights in search of eggs, and  making a happy find of a niche filled with the edible moss-fungi.    By late afternoon he had the shell scooped fairly clean and the  wolverines had carried away for burial such portions as they had not  been able to consume at their first eating. Meanwhile, the  leather-headed birds had grown bold enough to snatch up the fragments he  tossed out on the water, struggling for that bounty against feeders  arising from the depths of the lagoon.    At the coming of dusk Shann hauled the bloodstained, grisly trophy well  up the beach and wedged it among the rocks, determined not to lose his  treasure. Then he stripped and washed, first his clothing and then  himself, rubbing his hands and arms with sand until his skin was tender.  He was still exultant at his luck. The drift would supply him with  materials for an outrigger. One more day's work--or maybe two--and he  could leave. He wrung out his blouse and gazed toward the distant line  of the shore. Once he had his new canoe ready he would try to make the  trip back in the early morning while the mists were still on the sea.  That should give him cover against any Throg flight.    That night Shann slept in the deep fog of bodily exhaustion. There were  no dreams, nothing but an unconsciousness which even a Throg attack  could not have pierced. He roused in the morning with an odd feeling of  guilt. The water hole he had scooped in the valley yielded him some  swallows tasting of earth, but he had almost forgotten the flavor of a  purer liquid. Munching on a fistful of moss, he hurried down to the  shore, half fearing to find the shell gone, his luck out once again.    Not only was the shell where he had wedged it, but he had done better  than he knew when he had left it exposed in the night. Small things  scuttled away from it into hiding, and several birds arose--scavengers  had been busy lightening his unwelcome task for that morning. And  seeing how the clean-up process had gone, Shann had a second  inspiration.    Pushing the thing down the beach, he sank it in the shallows with  several rocks to anchor it. Within a few seconds the shell was invaded  by a whole school of spiny-tailed fish, that ate greedily. Leaving his  find to their cleansing, Shann went back to prospect the pile of raft  material, choosing pieces which could serve for an outrigger frame. He  was handicapped as he had been all along by the absence of the vines one  could use for lashings. And he had reached the point of considering a  drastic sacrifice of his clothing to get the necessary strips when he  saw Taggi dragging behind him one of the jointed legs the wolverines had  put in storage the day before.    Now and again Taggi laid his prize on the shingle, holding it firmly  pinned with his forepaws as he tried to worry loose a section of flesh.  But apparently that feat was beyond even his notable teeth, and at  length he left it lying there in disgust while he returned to a cache  for more palatable fare. Shann went to examine more closely the  triple-jointed limb.    The casing was not as hard as horn or shell, he discovered upon testing;  it more resembled tough skin laid over bone. With a knife he tried to  loosen the skin--a tedious job requiring a great deal of patience, since  the tissue tore if pulled away too fast. But with care he acquired a few  thongs perhaps a foot long. Using two of these, he made a trial binding  of one stick to another, and experimented farther, soaking the whole  construction in sea water and then exposing it to the direct rays of the  sun.    When he examined his test piece an hour later, the skin thongs had set  into place with such success that the one piece of wood might have been  firmly glued to the other. Shann shuffled his feet in a little dance of  triumph as he went on to the lagoon to inspect the water-logged shell.  The scavengers had done well. One scraping, two at the most, would have  the whole thing clean and ready to use.    But that night Shann dreamed. No climbing of a skull-shaped mountain  this time. Instead, he was again on the beach, laboring under an  overwhelming compulsion, building something for an alien purpose he  could not understand. And he worked as hopelessly as a beaten slave,  knowing that what he made was to his own undoing. Yet he could not halt  the making, because just beyond the limit of his vision there stood a  dominant will which held him in bondage.    And he awoke on the beach in the very early dawn, not knowing how he had  come there. His body was bathed in sweat, as it had been during his  day's labors under the sun, and his muscles ached with fatigue.    But when he saw what lay at his feet he cringed. The framework  of the outrigger, close to completion the night before, was  dismantled--smashed. All those strips of hide he had so laboriously  culled were cut--into inch-long bits which could be of no service.    Shann whirled, ran to the shell he had the night before pulled from the  water and stowed in safety. Its rounded dome was dulled where it had  been battered, but there was no break in the surface. He ran his hands  anxiously over the curve to make sure. Then, very slowly, he came back  to the mess of broken wood and snipped hide. And he was sure, only too  sure, of one thing. He, himself, had wrought that destruction.

By the time he  finished, Bart felt he would rather Ringg's claws had laid him bleeding  to the bone than stand there in the naked contempt of the old Lhari's  freezing eyes.    \"Half-fledged nestlings trying to do a man's work! So someone forgot the  panel, or damaged the panel by mistake--no, not another word,\" he  commanded, as Ringg's crest came proudly up. \"I don't care who did what!  Any more of this, and the one who does it can try his claws on the  captain of the _Swiftwing_!\" He looked ugly and dangerous. \"I thought  better of you both. Get below, you squalling kittens! Let me not see  your faces again before we land!\"    As they went along the corridor, Ringg turned to Bart, apology and  chagrin in his eyes. \"Look--I never meant to get the Bald One down on  us,\" he said, but Bart kept his face resolutely averted. It was easier  this way, without pretense of friendship.           *       *       *       *       *    The light from the small captive sun grew more intense. Bart had never  known anything like it, and was glad to slip away and put the dark  contact lenses into his eyes. They made his eyes appear all enormous,  dilated pupil; fearfully, he hoped no one would notice. His arm smarted,  and he did not speak to Ringg all through the long, slow deceleration.    When the intercom ordered all crew members to the hatchway, Bart  lingered a minute, pinning the yellow radiation badge in a fold of his  cloak. A spasm of fear threatened to overwhelm him again, and  nightmarish loneliness. He felt agonizingly homesick for his own  familiar face. It seemed almost more than he could manage, to step out  into the corridor full of Lhari.    _It won't be long now._    The hatch opened. Even accustomed, as he was, to Lhari lights, Bart  squeezed his eyes shut at the blue-white brilliance that assaulted him  now. Then, opening slitted lids cautiously, he found that he could see.    A weirdly desolate scene stretched away before them. Bare, burning sand,  strewn with curiously colored rocks, lay piled in strange chaos; then he  realized there was an odd, but perceptible geometry to their  arrangement. They showed alternate crystal and opaque faces. Old Rugel  noted his look of surprise.    \"Never been here before? That's right, you've always worked on the  Polaris run. Well, those aren't true rocks, but living creatures of a  sort. The crystals are alive; the opaque faces are lichens that have  something like chlorophyll and can make their food from air and  sunlight. The rocks and lichens live in symbiosis. They have  intelligence of a sort, but fortunately they don't mind us, or our  automatic mining machinery. Every time, though, we find some new lichen  that's trying to set up a symbiote cycle with the concrete of our  bunkers.\"    \"And every time,\" Ringg said cheerfully, \"somebody--usually me--has to  see about having them scraped down and repainted. Maybe someday I'll  find a paint the lichens don't like the taste of.\"    \"Going to explore with Ringg?\" Rugel asked, and Ringg, always ready to  let bygones be bygones, grinned and said, \"Sure!\" Bart could not face  him.    Vorongil stopped and said, \"This your first time here, young Bartol? How  would you like to visit the monument with me? You can see the machinery  on the way back.\"    Relieved at not having to go with Ringg, he followed the captain,  falling into step beside him. They moved in silence, along the smooth  stone path.    \"The crystal creatures made this road,\" Vorongil said at last. \"I think  they read minds a little. There used to be a very messy, rocky desert  here, and we used to have to scrabble and scratch our way to the  monument. Then one day a ship--not mine--touched down and discovered  that there was a beautiful smooth road leading up to the monument. And  the lichens never touch that stone--but you probably had all this in  school. Excited, Bartol?\"    \"No--no, sir. Why?\"    \"Eyes look a bit odd. But who could blame you for being excited? I never  come here without remembering Rhazon and his crew on that long jump. The  longest any Lhari captain ever made. A blind leap in the dark, remember,  Bartol. Through the dark, through the void, with his own crew cursing  him for taking the chance! No one had ever crossed between galaxies--and  remember, they were using the Ancient Math!\"    He paused, and Bart said through a catch of breath. \"Quite an  achievement.\" His badge still looked reassuringly yellow.    \"You young people have no sense of wonder,\" Vorongil said. \"Not that I  blame you. You can't realize what it was like in those days. Oh, we'd  had star-travel for centuries, we were beginning to stagnate. And now  look at us! Oh, they derided Rhazon--said that even if he did find  anyone, any other race, they'd be monsters with whom we could never  communicate. But here we have a whole new galaxy for peaceful trade, a  new mathematics that takes all the hazard out of space travel, our  Mentorian friends and allies.\" He smiled. \"Don't tell the High Council  on me, but I think they deserve a lot more credit than most Lhari care  to give them. Between ourselves, I think the next Panarch may see it  that way.\"    Vorongil paused. \"Here's the monument.\"    It lay between the crystal columns, tall, of pale blue sandstone, with  letters in deep shadow of such contrast that the Lhari could read them:  a high, sheer, imposing stele. Vorongil read the words slowly aloud in  the musical Lhari language:    \"'Here, with thanks to Those who Watch the Great Night, I, Rhazon of  Nedrun, raise a stone of memory. Here we first do touch the new worlds.  Let us never again fear to face the unknown, trusting that the Mind of  All Knowledge still has many surprises in store for all the living.'    \"I think I admire courage more than anything there is, Bartol. Who else  could have dared it? Doesn't it make you proud to be a Lhari?\"    Bart had felt profoundly moved; now he snapped back to awareness of who  he was and what he was doing. So only the Lhari had courage? _Life has  surprises, all right, Captain_, he thought grimly.    He glanced down at the badge strip of plastic on his arm. It began to  tinge faint orange as he looked, and a chill of fear went over him. He  had to get away somehow--get to cover!    He looked round and his fear was almost driven from his mind. \"Captain,  the rocks! They're moving!\"    Vorongil said, unruffled, \"Why, so they are. They do, you know; they  have intelligence of a sort. Though I've never actually _seen_ them move  before, I know they shift places overnight. I wonder what's going on?\"  They were edging back, the path widening and changing. \"Oh, well, maybe  they're going to do some more landscaping for us. I once knew a captain  who swore they could read his mind.\"    Bart saw the slow, inexorable deepening of his badge--he _had_ to get  away. He tensed, impatient; gripped by fists of panic. Somewhere on this  world, Montano and his men were setting up their lethal radiations....    _Think of this: a Lhari ship of our own to study, to know how it works,  to see the catalyst and find out where it comes from, to read their  records and star routes. Now we know we can use it without dying in the  warp-drive...._    _Think of this: to be human again, yet to travel the stars with men of  my own race!_    _It's worth a few deaths!_    Even Vorongil? Standing here, talking to him, he might--_say it! You  talked to him as if he'd been your father! Oh, Dad, Dad, what would you  do?_    His voice was steady, as he said, \"It's very good of you to show me all  this, sir, but the other men will call me a slacker. Hadn't I better get  to a work detail?\"    \"Hm, maybe so, feathertop,\" Vorongil said. \"Let me see--well, down this  way is the last row of bunkers. See the humps? You can check inside to  see if they're full or empty and save us the trouble of exploring if  they're all empty. Have a look round inside if you care to--the robot  machinery's interesting.\"    Bart tensed; he had wondered how he'd get hidden inside, but he asked,  \"Not locked?\"    \"Locked?\" The old Lhari's short, yellowed crest bobbed in surprise.  \"Why? Who ever comes here but our ships? And what could we do with the  stuff but take it back with us? Why locked? You've been on the drift too  long--among those thieving humans! It's time you got back to live among  decent folk again. Well, go along.\"    The sting of the words stiffened Bart as he took his leave. The color of  the badge seemed deeper orange....    _When it's red, you're dead._    _It's true. The Lhari don't steal. They don't even seem to understand  dishonesty._    _But they lied--lied to us all...._    _Knowing what we were like, maybe! That we'd steal their ships, their  secrets, their lives!_    The deepening color of the badge seemed the one visible thing in a  strange glaring world. He walked along the row of bunkers, realizing he  need not check if they were full or empty--the Lhari wouldn't live long  enough to harvest their better-than-graphite lubricant. They'd be dead.    The last bunker was empty. He looked at his orange badge and stepped  inside, heart pounding so loudly he thought it was an external sound--it  _was_ an external sound, a step.    \"Don't move one inch,\" said a voice in Universal, and Bart froze,  trembling. He looked cautiously round.    Montano stood there, spacesuited, his head bare, dark contact lenses  blurring his eyes. And in his hand a drawn blaster was held  level--trained straight at Bart's heart.          CHAPTER TWELVE      After the first moment of panic, Bart realized Montano could not tell  him from a Lhari. He remained motionless. \"It's me, Montano--Bart  Steele.\"    The man lowered the weapon and put it away. \"You nearly got yourself cut  down,\" he said. \"Did you make it all right?\" He crossed behind Bart,  inspecting the fastenings of the bunker.    \"It's just luck I"]]]
