She said so.  An' when she learned I was Jean Isbel she turned her  back on me an' walked away.\"'    At this point of his narrative the old man halted as if to impress  Ellen not only with what just had been told, but particularly with what  was to follow.  The reciting of this tale had evidently given Sprague  an unconscious pleasure.  He glowed.  He seemed to carry the burden of  a secret that he yearned to divulge.  As for Ellen, she was deadlocked  in breathless suspense.  All her emotions waited for the end. She  begged Sprague to hurry.    \"Wal, I wish I could skip the next chapter an' hev only the last to  tell,\" rejoined the old man, and he put a heavy, but solicitous, hand  upon hers.... Simm Bruce haw-hawed loud an' loud.... 'Say, Nez Perce,'  he calls out, most insolent-like, 'we air too good sheepmen heah to hev  the wool pulled over our eyes.  We shore know what y'u meant by Ellen  Jorth.  But y'u wasn't smart when y'u told her y'u was Jean Isbel! ...  Haw-haw!'    \"Isbel flashed a strange, surprised look from the red-faced Bruce to  Greaves and to the other men.  I take it he was wonderin' if he'd heerd  right or if they'd got the same hunch thet 'd come to him. An' I reckon  he determined to make sure.    \"'Why wasn't I smart?' he asked.    \"'Shore y'u wasn't smart if y'u was aimin' to be one of Ellen Jorth's  lovers,' said Bruce, with a leer.  'Fer if y'u hedn't give y'urself  away y'u could hev been easy enough.'    \"Thar was no mistakin' Bruce's meanin' an' when he got it out some of  the men thar laughed.  Isbel kept lookin' from one to another of them.  Then facin' Greaves, he said, deliberately: 'Greaves, this drunken  Bruce is excuse enough fer a show-down.  I take it that you are  sheepmen, an' you're goin' on Jorth's side of the fence in the matter  of this sheep rangin'.'    \"'Wal, Nez Perce, I reckon you hit plumb center,' said Greaves, dryly.  He spread wide his big hands to the other men, as if to say they'd  might as well own the jig was up.    \"'All right.  You're Jorth's backers.  Have any of you a word to say in  Ellen Jorth's defense?  I tell you the Mexican lied.  Believin' me or  not doesn't matter.  But this vile-mouthed Bruce hinted against thet  girl's honor.'    \"Ag'in some of the men laughed, but not so noisy, an' there was a  nervous shufflin' of feet.  Isbel looked sort of queer.  His neck had a  bulge round his collar.  An' his eyes was like black coals of fire.  Greaves spread his big hands again, as if to wash them of this part of  the dirty argument.    \"'When it comes to any wimmen I pass--much less play a hand fer a  wildcat like Jorth's gurl,' said Greaves, sort of cold an' thick.  'Bruce shore ought to know her.  Accordin' to talk heahaboots an' what  HE says, Ellen Jorth has been his gurl fer two years.'    \"Then Isbel turned his attention to Bruce an' I fer one begun to shake  in my boots.    \"'Say thet to me!' he called.    \"'Shore she's my gurl, an' thet's why Im a-goin' to hev y'u run off  this range.'    \"Isbel jumped at Bruce.  'You damned drunken cur!  You vile-mouthed  liar! ... I may be an Isbel, but by God you cain't slander thet girl to  my face! ... Then he moved so quick I couldn't see what he did. But I  heerd his fist hit Bruce.  It sounded like an ax ag'in' a beef. Bruce  fell clear across the room.  An' by Jinny when he landed Isbel was  thar.  As Bruce staggered up, all bloody-faced, bellowin' an' spittin'  out teeth Isbel eyed Greaves's crowd an' said: 'If any of y'u make a  move it 'll mean gun-play.'  Nobody moved, thet's sure. In fact, none  of Greaves's outfit was packin' guns, at least in sight. When Bruce got  all the way up--he's a tall fellar--why Isbel took a full swing at him  an' knocked him back across the room ag'in' the counter.  Y'u know when  a fellar's hurt by the way he yells.  Bruce got thet second smash right  on his big red nose.... I never seen any one so quick as Isbel.  He  vaulted over thet counter jest the second Bruce fell back on it, an'  then, with Greaves's gang in front so he could catch any moves of  theirs, he jest slugged Bruce right an' left, an' banged his head on  the counter.  Then as Bruce sunk limp an' slipped down, lookin' like a  bloody sack, Isbel let him fall to the floor.  Then he vaulted back  over the counter.  Wipin' the blood off his hands, he throwed his  kerchief down in Bruce's face.  Bruce wasn't dead or bad hurt.  He'd  jest been beaten bad. He was moanin' an' slobberin'.  Isbel kicked him,  not hard, but jest sort of disgustful.  Then he faced thet crowd.  'Greaves, thet's what I think of your Simm Bruce.  Tell him next time  he sees me to run or pull a gun.'  An' then Isbel grabbed his rifle an'  package off the counter an' went out.  He didn't even look back.  I  seen him nount his horse an' ride away.... Now, girl, what hev you to  say?\"    Ellen could only say good-by and the word was so low as to be almost  inaudible.  She ran to her burro.  She could not see very clearly  through tear-blurred eyes, and her shaking fingers were all thumbs. It  seemed she had to rush away--somewhere, anywhere--not to get away from  old John Sprague, but from herself--this palpitating, bursting self  whose feet stumbled down the trail.  All--all seemed ended for her.  That interminable story!  It had taken so long.  And every minute of it  she had been helplessly torn asunder by feelings she had never known  she possessed.  This Ellen Jorth was an unknown creature.  She sobbed  now as she dragged the burro down the canyon trail.  She sat down only  to rise.  She hurried only to stop.  Driven, pursued, barred, she had  no way to escape the flaying thoughts, no time or will to repudiate  them.  The death of her girlhood, the rending aside of a veil of maiden  mystery only vaguely instinctively guessed, the barren, sordid truth of  her life as seen by her enlightened eyes, the bitter realization of the  vileness of men of her clan in contrast to the manliness and chivalry  of an enemy, the hard facts of unalterable repute as created by slander  and fostered by low minds, all these were forces in a cataclysm that  had suddenly caught her heart and whirled her through changes immense  and agonizing, to bring her face to face with reality, to force upon  her suspicion and doubt of all she had trusted, to warn her of the  dark, impending horror of a tragic bloody feud, and lastly to teach her  the supreme truth at once so glorious and so terrible--that she could  not escape the doom of womanhood.    About noon that day Ellen Jorth arrived at the Knoll, which was the  location of her father's ranch.  Three canyons met there to form a  larger one.  The knoll was a symmetrical hill situated at the mouth of  the three canyons.  It was covered with brush and cedars, with here and  there lichened rocks showing above the bleached grass.  Below the Knoll  was a wide, grassy flat or meadow through which a willow-bordered  stream cut its rugged boulder-strewn bed.  Water flowed abundantly at  this season, and the deep washes leading down from the slopes attested  to the fact of cloudbursts and heavy storms.  This meadow valley was  dotted with horses and cattle, and meandered away between the timbered  slopes to lose itself in a green curve.  A singular feature of this  canyon was that a heavy growth of spruce trees covered the slope facing  northwest; and the opposite slope, exposed to the sun and therefore  less snowbound in winter, held a sparse growth of yellow pines.  The  ranch house of Colonel Jorth stood round the rough corner of the largest  of the three canyons, and rather well hidden, it did not obtrude its  rude and broken-down log cabins, its squalid surroundings, its black  mud-holes of corrals upon the beautiful and serene meadow valley.    Ellen Jorth approached her home slowly, with dragging, reluctant steps;  and never before in the three unhappy years of her existence there had  the ranch seemed so bare, so uncared for, so repugnant to her.  As she  had seen herself with clarified eyes, so now she saw her home.  The  cabin that Ellen lived in with her father was a single-room structure  with one door and no windows.  It was about twenty feet square.  The  huge, ragged, stone chimney had been built on the outside, with the  wide open fireplace set inside the logs.  Smoke was rising from the  chimney.  As Ellen halted at the door and began unpacking her burro she  heard the loud, lazy laughter of men.  An adjoining log cabin had been  built in two sections, with a wide roofed hall or space between them.  The door in each cabin faced the other, and there was a tall man  standing in one.  Ellen recognized Daggs, a neighbor sheepman, who  evidently spent more time with her father than at his own home,  wherever that was.  Ellen had never seen it.  She heard this man drawl,  \"Jorth, heah's your kid come home.\"    Ellen carried her bed inside the cabin, and unrolled it upon a couch  built of boughs in the far corner.  She had forgotten Jean Isbel's  package, and now it fell out under her sight.  Quickly she covered it.  A Mexican woman, relative of Antonio, and the only servant about the  place, was squatting Indian fashion before the fireplace, stirring a  pot of beans.  She and Ellen did not get along well together, and few  words ever passed between them.  Ellen had a canvas curtain stretched  upon a wire across a small triangular corner, and this afforded her a  little privacy.  Her possessions were limited in number.  The crude  square table she had constructed herself.  Upon it was a little  old-fashioned walnut-framed mirror, a brush and comb, and a dilapidated  ebony cabinet which contained odds and ends the sight of which always  brought a smile of derisive self-pity to her lips.  Under the table  stood an old leather trunk.  It had come with her from Texas, and  contained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20709"],[0,"From Pole to Pole: A Book for Young People (#19)"],[1,"is useless to warn the  natives of the danger, for they do not believe a word of it--and so die  in their turn.      A BALUCHI RAID    We were glad to leave a country where the plague had taken up its abode  and to hasten away to the desert tracts of Baluchistan, which still  separated us from India. My old servants had taken their departure, and  a new retinue, all Baluchis, accompanied me.    We rode _jambas_, or swift-footed dromedaries, which for generations  have been trained for speed. Their legs are long and thin, but strong,  with large foot pads which strike the hard ground with a heavy tapping  sound as they run. They carry their heads high and move more quickly  than the majestic caravan camels; but when they run they lower their  heads below the level of the hump and keep it always horizontal.    Two men ride on each _jambas_, and therefore the saddle has two hollows  and two pairs of stirrups. A peg is thrust through the cartilage of the  nose and to its ends a thin cord is attached. By pulling this to one  side or the other the dromedary may be turned in any direction. My  courser had a swinging gait but did not jolt; and I sat comfortably and  firmly in the saddle as we left mile after mile behind.    It is not more than thirty or forty years ago since the Baluchis used to  make raids into Persian territory, and although much better order is  maintained now that the country is under British administration, an  escort is still necessary--I had six men mounted on dromedaries and  armed with modern rifles. This is how a raid is conducted.    One evening Shah Sevar, or the \"Riding King,\" the warlike chieftain of a  tribe in western Baluchistan, sits smoking a pipe by the camp fire in  front of his black tent, which is supported by tamarisk boughs (Plate  VII.). The tale-teller has just finished a story, when two white-clad  men with white turbans on their heads emerge from the darkness of the  night. They tie up their dromedaries, humbly salute Shah Sevar, who  invites them to sit down and help themselves to tea from an iron pot.  Other men come up to the fire. All carry long guns, spears, swords, and  daggers. Some lead two or three dromedaries each.    Fourteen men are now gathered round the fire. There is a marked silence  in the assembly, and Shah Sevar looks serious. At length he asks, \"Is  everything ready?\"    \"Yes,\" is the reply from all sides.    \"Are the powder and shot horns filled?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And the provisions packed in their bags?\"    \"Yes--dates, sour cheese, and bread for eight days.\"    \"I told you the day before yesterday that this time we shall strike at  Bam. Bam is a populous town. If we are discovered too early the fight  may be hot. We must steal through the desert like jackals. The distance  is three hundred miles, four days' journey.\"    Again Shah Sevar stares into the fire for a while and then asks, \"Are  the _jambas_ in good condition?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And ten spare dromedaries for the booty?\"    \"Yes.\"    [Illustration: PLATE VII. A BALUCHI NOMAD TENT.]    Then he rises and all the others follow his example. Their wild, bold  faces glow coppery-red in the light of the fire. They consider petty  thieving a base occupation, but raiding and pillaging an honourable  sport, and boast of the number of slaves they have captured in their  day.    \"Mount,\" commands the chieftain in a subdued voice. Muskets are thrown  over the shoulder and rattle against the hanging powder-horn and the  leather bag for bullets, flint, steel, and tinder. Daggers are thrust  into belts, and the men mount without examining the saddle-girths and  bridles, for all has been carefully made ready beforehand. The spear is  secured in front of the saddle. \"In the name of Allah,\" calls out Shah  Sevar, and the party rides off through the night at a steady pace.    The path they follow is well known and the stars serve as guides. Day  breaks, the sun rises, and the shadows of the dromedaries point towards  Bam over the hard yellow sand where not a shrub grows. Not a word has  been spoken during the night, but when the first seventy miles have been  traversed the chief says, \"We will rest a while at the Spring of White  Water.\" On arriving at the spring they refill their water-skins and let  the dromedaries drink. Then they go up into the neighbouring hills and  wait till the hot hours of the day are over. They never encamp at the  springs, for there they are likely to meet with other people.    At dusk they are in the saddle again. They ride harder than during the  first night and travel till they come to a salt spring. The third night  the dromedaries begin to breathe more heavily, and when the sun rises  flecks of white froth hang from their trembling lips. They are not tired  but only a little winded, and they press on through clouds of dust  without their riders having to urge them.    Now the party leaves behind it the last desert path, which is only once  in a while used by a caravan, and beyond it is a perfect wilderness of  hardened salt-impregnated mud. Nothing living can be seen, not even a  stray raven or vulture which might warn the people in Bam of their  danger. Without rest the robber band pushes on all day, as silent as the  desert, the only sounds being the long-drawn breathing of the  dromedaries and the rasping sound of their foot-pads on the ground. When  the reflection of the evening sky lies in purple shades over the desert,  they have only ten or twelve miles more to go.    Shah Sevar pulls up his dromedary and orders a halt in muffled tones,  as though he feared that his voice might be heard in Bam. With a hissing  noise the riders make their animals kneel and lie down, and then they  spring out of the saddle, and tie the end of the cord round the  dromedaries' forelegs to prevent the animals from getting up and making  a noise and thus spoiling the plan. All are tired out and stretch  themselves on the ground. Some sleep, others are kept awake by  excitement, while four riders go scouting in different directions. Bam  itself cannot be seen, but the hill is visible at the foot of which the  town stands. The men long for night and the cover of darkness.    The day has been calm and hot, but now the evening is cool and the  shadows dense. A faint breeze comes from the north, and Shah Sevar  smiles. If the wind were from the east, he would be obliged to make a  detour in order not to rouse the dogs of the town. It is now nine  o'clock and in an hour the people of Bam will be asleep. The men have  finished their meal, and have wrapped up the remainder of the dates,  cheese, and bread in their bundles and tied them upon the dromedaries.    \"Shall we empty the waterskins so as to make the loads lighter for the  attack?\" asks a Baluchi.    \"No,\" answers Shah Sevar; \"keep all the water that is left, for we may  not be able to fill the skins in the town before our retreat.\"    \"It is time,\" he says; \"have your weapons ready.\" They mount again and  ride slowly towards the town.    \"As soon as anything suspicious occurs I shall quicken my pace and you  must follow. You three with the baggage camels keep in the rear.\"    The robbers gaze in front like eagles on their prey, and the outlines of  the hill gradually rise higher above the western horizon. Now only three  miles remain, and their sight, sharpened by an outdoor life,  distinguishes the gardens of Bam. They draw near. The bark of a dog is  heard, another joins in--all the dogs of the town are barking; they have  winded the dromedaries.    \"Come on,\" shouts the chief. With encouraging cries the dromedaries are  urged forward; their heads almost touch the ground; they race along  while froth and dust fly about them. The dogs bark furiously and some of  them have already come out to meet the dromedaries. Now the wild chase  reaches the entrance to the town. Cries of despair are heard as the  inhabitants are wakened; and women and wailing children escape towards  the hill. The time is too short for any organised defence. There is no  one to take the command. The unfortunate inhabitants run over one  another like scared chickens and the riders are upon them. Shah Sevar  sits erect on his dromedary and leads the assault. Some jump down and  seize three men, twelve women, and six children, who are hastily bound  and put in charge of two Baluchis, while others quickly search some  houses close at hand. They come out again with two youths who have made  a useless resistance, a couple of sacks of grain, some household goods,  and all the silver they could find.    \"How many slaves?\" roars Shah Sevar.    \"Twenty-three,\" is answered from several directions.    \"That is enough; pack up.\" The slaves and the stolen goods are bound  fast on dromedaries. \"Quick, quick,\" shouts the chief. \"Back the way we  came.\" In the hurry and confusion some of the animals get entangled in  one another's ropes. \"Back! Back!\" The chieftain's practised eye has  detected a party of armed men coming up. Three shots are heard in the  darkness, and Shah Sevar falls backwards out of the saddle, while his  dromedary starts and flies off into the desert. The rider's left foot is  caught fast in the stirrup and his head drags in the dust. A bullet has  entered his forehead, but the blood is staunched by the dust of the  road. His foot slips out of the stirrup, and the \"Riding King\" lies dead  as a stone outside Bam.    Another robber is severely wounded and is cut to pieces by the townsmen.  Bam has waked up. The entangled dromedaries with their burdens of slaves  and goods are captured, but the rest of the party, twelve riders with  ten baggage camels, have vanished in the darkness, pursued by some  infuriated dogs. Sixteen of the inhabitants of the town are missing. The  whole thing has taken place in half an hour. Bam sleeps no more this  night.    Now the dromedaries are urged on to the uttermost; they have double  loads to carry, but they travel as quickly as they came."]]]
