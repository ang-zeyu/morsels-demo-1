Her  large eyes would wander from the harp to the musician's face; but her  confusion only became worse when her eyes timidly met his. He was very  patient with all her imperfect efforts, never blaming her but on the  contrary praising all her modest attempts beyond their merits. Then he  would sing a song of his own and play some deep chords which seemed to  thrill the air. The knight would listen entranced, and the maiden felt  love's blissful pain in her heart. She did not know what it was, or  how he had long since sung himself into her soul, and her tender heart  trembled at love's first revelation. The passion possessed her more  and more; it spread its power over these two hearts, and soon in the  quiet garden of the castle, Ronald clasped the daughter of the proud  knight to his heart.      III.    Love's first rapture is often followed by sorrow however, and  beautiful Rothtraut had yet to experience it.    It once happened that the knight surprised his child in the musician's  arms. His anger knew no bounds, and like a beast of prey he rushed at  the singer, when his daughter, suddenly become a woman, placed herself  bravely between her father and her lover. Her confession went to his  heart like a dagger, for with trembling lips and glowing cheeks, the  maiden acknowledged the secret of her love.    Pale but firm the singer stood before the knight.    \"I am only a wanderer but not a dishonourable one. Do not destroy with  a rough hand the flower which God has planted in our hearts, but give  me time. I will set out on my journey and will take up arms for my  beloved. And when I come back as a nobleman, you will give me your  daughter who loves me. Either I shall return as a knight, or you will  never see me again.\"    The lord of the castle looked at him sternly, while his daughter stood  weeping, holding Ronald's hand. \"Good-bye, maiden. Do not forget me,  Rothtraut!\" He was gone, and a wailing cry burst from the lips of the  unhappy girl.      IV.    To atone for many a wrong against Pope and Church, and also to fulfil  a solemn vow, the Emperor Barbarossa started on a crusade in his old  age. Many knights and heroes joined him, and his great army marched  through several countries until they came to the Levant. Then they  journeyed on to Syria where the great hero's career ended. Barbarossa  was drowned, and the eyes of his followers turned to Henry, his son,  as their leader. The latter, who became emperor under the name of  Henry VI. was a very capable general; he was also a lover of music,  and is said to have composed many a melody which remains with us to  the present day.    Many supposed that it was not the royal minstrel who composed the  songs, but that they came from the hand of Ronald who was now as  skilled with his sword as with his harp, and who had become a great  favourite of the emperor. He was a powerful warrior, and had already  overthrown many a Saracen. Once when the crusaders had gained a  glorious victory, he composed a song in honour of it, and sang it  himself on his harp. The song went the round of the camp, and the  singer became a great friend of the emperor. But even such favour did  not drive the shadow from Ronald's soul, and often when he was singing  one of his most beautiful songs to Henry, he would suddenly break off  and rush out of the tent in great grief. One day the emperor found out  what he had long guessed, and made Ronald confess his story to him.    Some days afterwards the crusaders began the storming of Acre, the  impregnable fortress of the Saracens. Ronald was fighting by Henry's  side. A Saracen dashed his falchion at the king's head, but Ronald  with a mighty blow clove the infidel's skull in two. In the evening of  the same day Henry called all his warriors together, and dubbed the  brave champion knight with his own hand. Ronald of Harfenstein was to  be his name, and a lyre lying on a falchion and a sword, were to be  his arms. The emperor promised to build him a castle on the borders of  the Rhine, which was to be called Harfeneck.    Plague broke out in the camp, and many a gallant crusader fell victim  to it. Among them was the emperor himself, whose death caused  unspeakable grief to Ronald.      V.    One day a weary crusader was seen riding along the banks of the Rhine.  Wherever he passed, the people asked him if it were true that  Barbarossa was not drowned in the Holy Land, but was living in the  Kyffhaeuser Mountain, and would soon come back to his own neglected  kingdom. The crusader barely answered their questions, but urged on  his tired steed along the Rhine. At last the silvery waters of the Ahr  appeared before him, and he saw the gables of the castle. The rider  joyously spurred on his horse, and rode up through the forest to the  fortress where once he had sat on the drawbridge as a poor traveller.    The late guest was ushered up to the lord of the castle.    The knight, now a bent old man, rose from a melancholy reverie to  greet the unknown stranger.    \"I am Ronald, and have become a knight through the grace of the  Emperor Henry in the camp at Acre, and now I have come to win your  daughter Rothtraut.\"    \"Win her from death, for it robbed me of her two months ago,\" said the  proud lord of the castle, turning his head aside in deep grief. Then a  despairing groan thrilled through the chamber. Harsh words passed  between those two, one a man in his disconsolate sorrow, the other a  repentant father.    Ronald strode off to the lonely corner of the garden, and the newly  dug up earth showed him the place where Rothtraut lay. There he  remained late into the night, till darkness had surrounded him and  black night had settled on his soul. Then he turned and went away,  never to come back again.    In the East whence the crusaders had now returned, everyone talked of  the heroic deeds accomplished by Richard the Lion-hearted. The  Saracens well knew the fearless leader and the German knight who  fought at his side. Richard valued his bravery, even though he was  still a young knight. He meant to make him one of his vassals when he  returned to his own country. But his desire was never fulfilled, for  the thrust of a hostile lance which he had so often escaped, pierced  the knight's heart. So the minstrel of Neuenahr found a grave in the  Holy Land; the race of Harfenstein became extinct with the first of  the line, and the castle was never built.          EIFEL    The Arrow at Pruem      It was in the little town of Pruem many a long year ago that Lothaire,  the degenerate son of St. Louis, did penance for his sins. In the  church belonging to the town there are two very ancient pictures; one  of them represents a knight standing on a huge rock, shooting an  arrow, while his wife and retinue are looking devoutedly towards  heaven; the other represents a priest at an altar to whom an angel is  bringing an arrow.    Who is the knight?    Who is the holy man?    The knight is Nithard, noble lord of Guise, who lived in the north of  France towards the end of the ninth century. No children having been  born to his excellent wife Erkanfrida, the knight determined to leave  his estate for some pious object.    He meant to endow a cloister, where after their deaths, masses would  be read for him and his spouse. But it was a difficult matter to  select the most worthy from the many cloisters in the neighbourhood,  and by the advice of a pious priest he resolved to leave the decision  to Heaven.    He fastened the document bequeathing his possessions to an arrow, and  then set out for a great rock near the castle, accompanied by his wife  and numerous followers.    After a fervent prayer he shot the arrow skyward, and, so the pious  story runs, it was borne by angel hands, till it came to Pruem--a  journey of several days.    Ansbald, the holy abbot of the cloister, was standing at the altar  when the arrow fell at his feet. He read the document with  astonishment and gratitude, and in a moved voice, announced its  contents to the assembled congregation.    Knight Nithard assigned his estate to the cloister, and from that time  forth many pilgrims journeyed to Pruem to see the arrow which had been  carried there by angel hands.    The storms of many centuries have blown over those hallowed walls, but  the pictures in the old church belonging to the abbey still remain,  thus preserving the legend from oblivion.          AACHEN    The Building of the Minster      [Illustration: Karl der Grosse--Nach dem Gemaelde von Albrecht Duerer]    As Charlemagne, the mighty ruler of the Franks, rode one day from his  stronghold at Aix-la-Chapelle into the surrounding forest, his horse  is said to have suddenly trodden upon a spring. On touching the water,  the animal drew its foot back neighing loudly as if in great pain.    The rider's curiosity was aroused. He alighted, and dipping his hand  into the spring, found to his surprise that the water was very hot.  Thus Charlemagne, as the legend records, discovered the hot spring  which was to become the salvation of many thousands of ill and infirm  people.    The pious emperor recognised in this healthgiving spring the kind gift  of Providence, and he resolved to erect near the spot a house of God,  the round shape of which should remind posterity of the horse's hoof.    The building was soon begun, and Charlemagne saw with great  satisfaction the walls of the new minster rising high into the air. He  was not however destined to see its completion. When he died, he had  to leave the great Empire of the West to a feeble son, Lewis the  Pious. The latter was compelled to draw his sword against his own  children in order to assure for himself the crown he had inherited.    Many a great undertaking that Charlemagne had begun, remained  unfinished.    The building of the minster too was interrupted. The ground was left  desolate, and the walls and towers were threatened with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],[0,"Christmas: A Story (#19)"],[1,"er, to be  with her, as she had grown used to imagining him. She had thought that  he was not coming, and he was almost here.... She knew now that she was  glad of this, no matter what it brought her; glad, as she had never  known how to be glad of anything before. He was coming--there was a  thrill in the words every time that she thought them. Already she was  welcoming him in her heart, already he was here, already he was born  into her life....    ... With a soft, fierce rush of feeling not her own, it seemed to her  that her point of perception was somehow drawn inward, as if she no  longer saw from the old places, as if something in her that was not used  to looking, looked. In the seat where her will had been was no will. But  somewhere in there, beyond all conflict, she felt _herself_ to be.  Beyond a thousand mists, volitions, little seekings for comfort,  rebellions at toil, the cryings of personality for its physical own, she  stood at last, herself within herself. And that which, through the slow  process of her life and of life and being immeasurably before her, had  been seeking its expression, building up its own vehicle of incarnation,  quite suddenly and simply flowered. It was as if the weight and the  striving within her had been the pangs of some birth. She stood, as  light of heart as a little child, filled with peace and tender  exaltation.    These filled her on the road which she took to meet him--and took alone,  for she would have no one go with her. (\"What's come over Mary?\" they  asked one another in the kitchen. \"She acts like she was somebody else  and herself too.\") The night lay about her as any other winter night,  white and black,--a clean white world on which men set a pattern of  highway and shelter, a clean dark sky on which a story is written in  stars; and between--no mystery, but only growth. Out toward the  drawbridge the road was not well broken. She went, stumbling in the ruts  and hardly conscious of them. And Mary thought--    \"Something in me is glad.    \"It's as if something in me knew how to be glad more than I ever knew  how alone.    \"For I'm nothing but me, here in Old Trail Town, and yet it's as if  Something had come, secret, on purpose to make me know why to be glad.    \"It's something in the world bigger than I know about.    \"It's in me, and I guess it was in folks before me, and it will be in  folks always.    \"It isn't just for Ebenezer Rule and the City.    \"It's for everybody, here in Old Trail Town as much as anywhere.    \"It's for folks that's hungry for it, and it's for folks that ain't.    \"It's always been in the world and it always will be in the world, and  some day we'll know what to do.\"    But this was hardly in her feeling, or even in her thought; it lay  within her thanksgiving that the child was coming; and he only a little  way down there across the marsh.    ... It seemed quite credible and even fitting that the mighty, rushing,  lighted Express, which seldom stopped at Old Trail Town, should that  night come thundering across the marsh, and slow down at the drawbridge  for her sake and the little boy's. Several coaches' length from where  she stood she saw a lantern shine where they were lifting him down. She  ran ankle deep through the thinly crusted snow.    \"_That's_ it!\" said the conductor. \"All the way from Idaho!\" and swung  his lantern from the step. \"Merry Christmas!\" he called back.    The little thing clasping Mary's hand suddenly leaped up and down beside  her.    \"Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!\" he shouted with all  his might.    Mary Chavah stood silent, and as the train drew away held out her hand,  still in silence, for the boy to take.    As the noise of the train lessened, he looked up.    \"Are you her?\" he asked soberly.    \"Yes,\" she cried joyously, \"I'm her!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Their way led east between high banks of snow. At the end of the road  was the village, looking like something lying on the great white plate  of the meadows and being offered to one who needed it. At the far end of  the road which was Old Trail Road, hung the blue arc light of the Town  Hall, center to the constellation of the home lights and the shop lights  and the street lights. There, in her house, were her neighbours,  gathered to do no violence to that Christmas paper of theirs, since  there was to be no \"present trading,\" no \"money spending.\"  Nevertheless, they had drawn together by common consent, and it was  Christmas Eve. She knew it now: There is no arbitrary shutting out of  that for which Christmas stands. As its spirit was in the village, so  its spirit is in the world--denied indeed, put upon, crowned with  mockery, dragged in the dirt, bearing alien burdens, but through it all  immaculate, waiting for men to cross the threshold at which it never  ceases to beckon to a common heritage: Home of the world, with a  thousand towers shining with uncounted lights, lying very near--above  the village, at the end of the Old Trail Road, upon the earth at the end  of a yet unbeaten path--where men face the sovereign fact of humanhood.    ... But all this lay within Mary's dumb thanksgiving that the child was  running at her side. And the vision that she saw streamed down from  Capella, of the brightness of an hundred of our suns, the star that  stood in the east above the village where she lived.    Lanterns glowed through the roadside shrubbery, little kindly lights,  like answers; and at a bend in the road voices burst about them, and  Buff Miles and the children, Gussie and Bennet and Tab and Pep and  little Emily, ran, singing, and closed about Mary and the child, and  went on with them, slipping into the \"church choir Christmas carols,\"  and more, that Buff had been fain to teach them. The music filled the  quiet night, rose, in the children's voices, like an invocation to all  time.        \"One for the way it all begun,      Two for the way it all has run,      What three'll be for I do forget,      But what will be has not been yet.      So holly and mistletoe,      So holly and mistletoe,      So holly and mistletoe      Over and over and over, oh!\"    Between songs the children whispered together for a minute.    \"What's the new little boy's name?\" asked Tab.    Nobody knew. That would be something to find out.    \"Well,\" Tab said, \"to-morrow morning, right after breakfast, I'm going  to bring Theophilus Thistledown down and _lend_ him to him.\"    \"Ain't we going to bury Sandy Claus right after breakfast?\" demanded  Gussie.    And all the children, even little Emily, answered:    \"No, let's not.\"    They all went on together and entered Mary's gate. Those  within,--hearing the singing, had opened the door, and they brought them  through that deep arch of warmth and light. Afterward, no one could  remember whether or not the greeting had been \"Merry Christmas,\" but  there could have been no mistaking what everybody meant.          XIV      At his gate in the street wall lined with snow-bowed lilacs and  mulberries, Ebenezer Rule waited in the dark for his two friends to come  back. He had found Kate Kerr in his kitchen methodically making a jar of  Christmas cookies. (\"You've got to eat, if it is Christmas,\" she had  defended herself in a whisper.) And to her stupefaction he had  dispatched her to Mary Chavah's with her entire Christmas baking in a  basket.    \"I don't believe they've got near enough for all the folks I see going,\"  he explained it.    While he went within doors he had left the hobbyhorse in the snow, close  to the wall; and he came back there to wait. The street had emptied. By  now every one had gone to Mary Chavah's. Once he caught the gleam of  lanterns down the road and heard children's voices singing. For some  time he heard the singing, and after it had stopped he fancied that he  heard it. Startled, he looked up into the wide night lying serene above  the town, and not yet become vexed by the town's shadows and interrupted  by their lights. It was as if the singing came from up there. But the  night kept its way of looking steadily beyond him.    ... It came to Ebenezer that the night had not always been so  unconscious of his presence. The one long ago, for example, when he had  slept beneath this wall and dreamed that he had a kingdom; those other  nights, when he had wandered abroad with his star glass. Then the night  used to be something else. It had seemed to meet him, to admit him. Now  he knew, and for a long time had known, that when he was abroad in the  night he was there, so to say, without its permission. As for men, he  could not tell when relation with them had changed, when he had begun to  think of them as among the externals; but he knew that now he ran along  the surface of them and let them go. He never met them as _Others_, as  belonging to countless equations of which he was one term, and they  playing that wonderful, near role of _Other_. Thus he had got along, as  if his own individuation were the only one that had ever occurred and as  if all the mass of mankind--and the Night and the Day--were  undifferentiated from some substance all inimical.    Then this vast egoism had heard itself expressed in the mention of  Bruce's baby--the third generation. But by the great sorcery wherewith  Nature has protected herself, this mammoth sense of self, when it  extends unto the next generations, becomes a keeper of the race.  Ebenezer had been touched, relaxed, disintegrated. Here was an interest  outside himself which was yet no external. Vast, level reaches lay about  that fact, and all long unexplored. But these were peopled. He saw them  peopled....    ... As in the cheer and stir within the house where that night were  gathered his townsfolk, his neighbours, his \"hands.\" He had thought that  their way of meeting him, if he chose to go among them, would matter  nothing. Abruptly now he saw that it would matter more than he could  bear. "]]]
