In the fourth century a number of dogs, of a great size, were sent in  iron cages from Ireland to Rome, and it is not improbable that the  dogs so sent were greyhounds, particularly as we learn from the  authority of Evelyn and others, that the Irish wolf-dog was used for  the fights of the bear-garden. \"Greyhound\" probably means a \"great  hound.\"    Holinshed, in his \"Description of Ireland and the Irish,\" written in  1586, has the following notice:--\"They are not without wolves, and  greyhounds to hunt them, bigger of bone and limb than a colt;\" and in  a frontispiece to Sir James Ware's \"History of Ireland,\" an  allegorical representation is given of a passage from the Venerable  Bede, in which two dogs are introduced, bearing a strong resemblance  to that given by Gesner, in his \"History of Quadrupeds,\" published in  1560.    The term _Irish_ is applied to Highland dogs, as everything Celtic  (not excepting the language) was designated in England; probably in  consequence of Ireland being, at that period, better known to the  English than Scotland. This is, perhaps, a proof of the similarity of  the Irish and Scotch deer-hounds.    Of the courage of the ancient deer-hound there can be little doubt,  from the nature of the game for which he was used. If any proof were  wanting, an incident mentioned by Evelyn in his Diary, in 1670, when  present at a bull-fight in the bear-garden, is conclusive. He says,  \"The bulls (meaning the bull-dogs) did exceeding well, but the Irish  wolf-dog exceeded, which was a tall greyhound, a stately creature,  indeed, who beat a cruel mastiff.\"    Here, perhaps, is a proof that the Irish wolf-dog was a greyhound; and  there can be little doubt that it is the same dog we find mentioned  under the name of the Irish greyhound.    Buffon remarks that \"the Irish greyhounds are of a very ancient race.  They were called by the ancients, dogs of Epirus, and Albanian dogs.  Pliny gives an account of a combat between one of these dogs, first  with a lion, and then with an elephant. In France they are so rare,  that I never saw above one of them, which appeared, when sitting, to  be about five feet high. He was totally white, and of a mild and  peaceable disposition.\"    The following description of these dogs, translated from a Celtic  poem, is probably an accurate one:--       \"An eye of sloe, with ear not low,      With horse's breast, with depth of chest,      With breadth of loin, and curve in groin      And nape set far behind the head--      Such were the dogs that Fingal bred.\"    It is probable that even in Scotland very few of the pure breed of  dogs are left, but those which are show a surprising combination of  speed, strength, size, endurance, courage, sagacity, docility, and it  may be added, dignity. The purest specimens of the deer-hound now to  be met with are supposed to be those belonging to Captain M'Neill of  Colonsay, two of them being called Buskar and Bran. And here let me  give an extract from an interesting and graphic account, published by  Mr. Scrope, of the performance of these dogs in the chase of a stag.  Let us fancy a party assembled over-night in a Highland glen,  consisting of sportsmen, deer-stalkers, a piper and two deer-hounds,  cooking their supper, and concluding it with the never-failing  accompaniment of whisky-toddy. Let us fancy them reposing on a couch  of dried fern and heather, and being awoke in the morning with the  lively air of \"Hey, Johnny Cope.\" While their breakfast is preparing,  they wash and refresh themselves at a pure mountain stream, and are  soon ready to issue forth with Buskar and Bran. The party proceeds up  a rocky glen, where the stalker sees a stag about a mile off. He  immediately prostrates himself on the ground, and in a second the rest  follow his example. We will not follow all the different manoeuvres of  the deer-stalker and his followers, but bring them at once near the  unconscious stag. After performing a very considerable circuit, moving  sometimes forwards and sometimes backwards, the party at length arrive  at the back of a hillock, on the opposite side of which the stalker  said, in a whisper, the deer was lying, and that he was not distant a  hundred yards. The whole party immediately moved forward in silent and  breathless expectation, with the dogs in front straining in the slips.  On reaching the top of the hillock, a full view of the noble stag  presented itself, who, having heard the footsteps, had sprung on his  legs, and was staring at his enemies, at the distance of about sixty  yards.    \"The dogs were slipped; a general halloo burst from us all, and the  stag, wheeling round, set off at full speed, with Buskar and Bran  straining after him.    \"The brown figure of the deer, with his noble antlers laid back,  contrasted with the light colour of the dogs stretching along the dark  heath, presented one of the most exciting scenes that it is possible  to imagine.    \"The deer's first attempt was to gain some rising ground to the left  of the spot where we stood, and rather behind us, but, being closely  pursued by the dogs, he soon found that his only safety was in speed;  and (as a deer does not run well up-hill, nor like a roe, straight  down hill) on the dogs approaching him, he turned, and almost retraced  his footsteps, taking, however, a steeper line of descent than the one  by which he ascended. Here the chase became most interesting--the dogs  pressed him hard, and the deer getting confused, found himself  suddenly on the brink of a small precipice of about fourteen feet in  height, from the bottom of which there sloped a rugged mass of stones.  He paused for a moment, as if afraid to take the leap, but the dogs  were so close that he had no alternative.    \"At this time the party were not above one hundred and fifty yards  distant, and most anxiously waited the result, fearing, from the  ruggedness of the ground below, that the deer would not survive the  leap. They were, however, soon relieved from their anxiety, for though  he took the leap, he did so more cunningly than gallantly, dropping  himself in the most singular manner, so that his hind legs first  reached the broken rocks below; nor were the dogs long in following  him. Buskar sprang first, and, extraordinary to relate, did not lose  his legs. Bran followed, and, on reaching the ground, performed a  complete somerset. He soon, however, recovered his legs, and the chase  was continued in an oblique direction down the side of a most rugged  and rocky brae, the deer, apparently more fresh and nimble than ever,  jumping through the rocks like a goat, and the dogs well up, though  occasionally receiving the most fearful falls.    \"From the high position in which we were placed, the chase was visible  for nearly half a mile. When some rising ground intercepted our view,  we made with all speed for a higher point, and, on reaching it, we  could perceive that the dogs, having got upon smooth ground, had  gained on the deer, who was still going at speed, and were close up  with him. Bran was then leading, and in a few seconds was at his  heels, and immediately seized his hock with such violence of grasp, as  seemed in a great measure to paralyse the limb, for the deer's speed  was immediately checked. Buskar was not far behind, for soon  afterwards passing Bran, he seized the deer by the neck.  Notwithstanding the weight of the two dogs which were hanging to him,  having the assistance of the slope of the ground, he continued  dragging them along at a most extraordinary rate (in defiance of their  utmost exertions to detain him), and succeeded more than once in  kicking Bran off. But he became at length exhausted--the dogs  succeeded in pulling him down; and though he made several attempts to  rise, he never completely regained his legs.    \"On coming up, we found him perfectly dead, with the joints of both  his forelegs dislocated at the knee, his throat perforated, and his  chest and flanks much lacerated.    \"As the ground was perfectly smooth for a considerable distance round  the place where he fell, and not in any degree swampy, it is difficult  to account for the dislocation of his knees, unless it happened during  his struggles to rise. Buskar was perfectly exhausted, and had lain  down, shaking from head to foot much like a broken-down horse; but on  our approaching the deer he rose, walked round him with a determined  growl, and would scarcely permit us to get near him. He had not,  however, received any cut or injury, while Bran showed several  bruises, nearly a square inch having been taken off the front of his  fore-leg, so that the bone was visible, and a piece of burnt heather  had passed quite through his foot.    \"Nothing could exceed the determined courage displayed by both dogs,  particularly by Buskar, throughout the chase, and especially in  preserving his hold, though dragged by the deer in a most violent  manner.\"    It is hoped that this account of the high spirit and perseverance of  the Scotch deer-hound will not be found uninteresting. This noble  creature was the pride and companion of our ancestors, and for a long  period in the history of this country, particularly in Ireland, the  only dog used in the sports of the field. When we consider the great  courage, combined with the most perfect gentleness of this animal, his  gigantic, picturesque, and graceful form, it must be a subject of  regret that the breed is likely to become extinct. Where shall we find  dogs possessing such a combination of fine and noble qualities?           *       *       *       *       *    The following anecdote, which with the accompanying fine engraving is  taken from the New Sporting Magazine for January 1839, presents a  striking example of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#19)"],[1,"earth's polar diameter--a view which would correspond  with his theory that the architects of the Great Pyramid were assisted  by divine inspiration; but what is certainly known about the sacred  cubit, which contained twenty-five of these inches, corresponds better  with the diameter which the Chaldaean astronomers, if they worked very  carefully, would have deduced from observations made in their own  country, on the supposition which they would naturally have made that  the earth is a perfect globe, not compressed at the poles. It is not  indeed at all certain that the sacred cubit bore any reference to the  earth's dimensions; but this seems tolerably well made out--that the  sacred cubit was about 25 inches in length, and that the circuit of the  pyramid's base contained a hundred inches for every day of the year.  Relations such as these are precisely what we might expect to find in  buildings having an astrological significance. Similarly, it would  correspond well with the mysticism of astrology that the pyramid should  be so proportioned as to make the height be the radius of a circle whose  circumference would equal the circuit of the pyramid's base. Again, that  long slant tunnel, leading downwards from the pyramid's northern face,  would at once find a meaning in this astrological theory. The slant  tunnel pointed to the pole-star of Cheops' time, when due north below  the true pole of the heavens. This circumstance had no observational  utility. It could afford no indication of time, because a pole-star  moves very slowly, and the pole-star of Cheops' day must have been in  view through that tunnel for more than an hour at a time. But, apart  from the mystical significance which an astrologer would attribute to  such a relation, it may be shown that this slant tunnel is precisely  what the astrologer would require in order to get the horoscope  correctly.    Another consideration remains to be mentioned which, while strengthening  the astrological theory of the pyramids, may bring us even nearer to the  true aim of those who planned and built these structures.    It is known also that the Chaldaeans from the earliest times pursued the  study of alchemy in connection with astrology, not hoping to discover  the philosopher's stone by chemical investigations alone, but by  carrying out such investigations under special celestial influence. The  hope of achieving this discovery, by which he would at once have had the  means of acquiring illimitable wealth, would of itself account for the  fact that Cheops expended so much labour and material in the erection of  the Great Pyramid, seeing that, of necessity, success in the search for  the philosopher's stone would be a main feature of his fortunes, and  would therefore be astrologically indicated in his nativity-pyramid, or  perhaps even be secured by following mystical observances proper for  ruling his planets.    The elixir of life may also have been among the objects which the  builders of the pyramids hoped to discover.    It may be noticed, as a somewhat significant circumstance, that, in the  account given by Ibn Abd Alkohm of the contents of the various pyramids,  those assigned to the Great Pyramid relate entirely to astrology and  associated mysteries. It is, of course, clear that Abd Alkohm drew  largely on his imagination. Yet it seems probable that there was also  some basis of tradition for his ideas. And certainly one would suppose  that, as he assigned a treasurer to the East pyramid ('a statue of black  agate, his eyes open and shining, sitting on a throne with a lance'), he  would have credited the building with treasure also, had not some  tradition taught otherwise. But he says that King Saurid placed in the  East pyramid, not treasures, but 'divers celestial spheres and stars,  and what they severally operate in their aspects, and the perfumes which  are to be used to them, and the books which treat of these matters.'[26]    But, after all, it must be admitted that the strongest evidence in  favour of the astrological (and alchemical) theory of the pyramids is to  be found in the circumstance that all other theories seem untenable. The  pyramids were undoubtedly erected for some purpose which was regarded by  their builders as most important. This purpose certainly related to the  personal fortunes of the kingly builders. It was worth an enormous  outlay of money, labour, and material. This purpose was such,  furthermore, that each king required to have his own pyramid. It was in  some way associated with astronomy, for the pyramids are built with most  accurate reference to celestial aspects. It also had its mathematical  and mystical bearings, seeing that the pyramids exhibit mathematical and  symbolical peculiarities not belonging to their essentially structural  requirements. And lastly, the erection of the pyramids was in some way  connected with the arrival of certain learned persons from Palestine,  and presumably of Chaldaean origin. All these circumstances accord well  with the theory I have advanced; while only some of them, and these not  the most characteristic, accord with any of the other theories.  Moreover, no fact known respecting the pyramids or their builders is  inconsistent with the astrological (and alchemical) theory. On the  whole, then, if it cannot be regarded as demonstrated (in its general  bearing, of course, for we cannot expect any theory about the pyramids  to be established in minute details), the astrological theory may fairly  be described as having a greater degree of probability in its favour  than any hitherto advanced.          IV.    _SWEDENBORG'S VISIONS OF OTHER WORLDS._      If it were permitted to men to select a sign whereby they should know  that a message came from the Supreme Being, probably the man of science  would select for the sign the communication of some scientific fact  beyond the knowledge of the day, but admitting of being readily put to  the test. The evidence thus obtained in favour of a revelation would  correspond in some sense to that depending on prophecies; but it would  be more satisfactory to men having that particular mental bent which is  called the scientific. Whether this turn of mind is inherent or the  result of training, it certainly leads men of science to be more  exacting in considering the value of evidence than any men, except  perhaps lawyers. In the case of the student of science, St. Paul's  statement that 'prophecies' 'shall fail' has been fulfilled, whereas it  may be doubted whether evidence from 'knowledge' would in like manner  'vanish away.' On the contrary, it would grow stronger and stronger, as  knowledge from observation, from experiment, and from calculation  continually increased. It can scarcely be said that this has happened  with such quasi-scientific statements as have actually been associated  with revelation. If we regard St. Paul's reference to knowledge as  relating to such statements as these, then nothing could be more  complete than the fulfilment of his own prediction, 'Whether there be  prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease;  whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.' The evidence from  prophecies fails for the exact inquirer, who perceives the doubts which  exist (among the most earnest believers) as to the exact meaning of the  prophetic words, and even in some cases as to whether prophecies have  been long since fulfilled or relate to events still to come. The  evidence from 'tongues' has ceased, and those are dust who are said to  have spoken in strange tongues. The knowledge which was once thought  supernatural has utterly vanished away. But if, in the ages of faith,  some of the results of modern scientific research had been revealed, as  the laws of the solar system, the great principle of the conservation of  energy, or the wave theory of light, or if some of the questions which  still remain for men of science to solve had been answered in those  times, the evidence for the student of science would have been  irresistible. Of course he will be told that even then he would have  hardened his heart; that the inquiry after truth tending naturally to  depravity of mind, he would reject even evidence based on his beloved  laws of probability; that his 'wicked and adulterous generation seeketh  \"in vain\" after a sign,' and that if he will not accept Moses and the  prophets, neither would he believe though one rose from the dead. Still  the desire of the student of science to base his faith on convincing  evidence (in a matter as important to him as to those who abuse him)  does seem to have something reasonable in it after all. The mental  qualities which cause him to be less easily satisfied than others, came  to him in the same way as his bodily qualities; and even if the result  to which his mental training leads him is as unfortunate as some  suppose, that training is not strictly speaking so heinously sinful that  nothing short of the eternal reprobation meted out to him by earthly  judges can satisfy divine justice. So that it may be thought not a  wholly unpardonable sin to speak of a sign which, had it been accorded,  would have satisfied even the most exacting student of science. Apart,  too, from all question of faith, the mere scientific interest of  divinely inspired communications respecting natural laws and processes  would justify a student of science in regarding them as most desirable  messages from a being of superior wisdom and benevolence. If prophecies  and tongues, why not knowledge, as evidence of a divine mission?    Such thoughts are suggested by the claim of some religious teachers to  the possession of knowledge other than that which they could have gained  by natural means. The claim has usually been quite honest. The teacher  of religion tests the reality of his mission in simple _a priori_  confidence that he has such a mission, and that therefore "]]]
