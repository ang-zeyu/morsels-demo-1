The vessels put into Puerto Bello, then once more stood westward; but  the wind, again heading them, began to blow with such terrible violence,  that they were obliged once more to run back towards the port they had  left; but before they could reach it, they were driven out to sea by a  terrific gale.  Here for days they were tossed about, while the rain  poured down in a perfect deluge, and to add to the terror of the seamen  a waterspout was seen approaching, from which they narrowly escaped.  For a short time the tempest ceased, but again raged with greater fury  than before.  No serious damage, however, having occurred, the vessels  at length, on the 3rd of February, 1503, came to an anchor off the river  Yebra, which was within a league of another river known as the Veragua,  running through the country said to abound in gold-mines.    Both rivers were sounded, and the Yebra, or Belen as Columbus called it,  being somewhat the deepest, the caravels entered it at high tide.  At  first the natives assumed a menacing attitude, but assured by the guides  of the pacific intentions of the Spaniards, they received them in a  friendly way.  Besides a quantity of fish and provisions, they brought  also numerous golden ornaments,--objects delighting the greedy eyes of  the Spaniards.  The Adelantado lost no time in ascending the river in a  well-armed boat to the residence of Quibian, the principal cacique of  the country.    The chief, a tall powerful warrior, received him in a friendly manner,  and presented him with various golden ornaments.  The following day  Quibian visited the Admiral, by whom he was hospitably entertained.    Suddenly, on the 24th of January, a vast mass of water came rushing down  the river, forcing the ships from their anchors, and dashing them  against each other with such violence that the foremast of the Admiral's  vessel was carried away, and the squadron placed in great danger; a  furious storm and the heavy surf on the bar preventing them from running  out to sea.    When the weather moderated, the Adelantado paid another visit up the  river to Quibian, who came down to meet him with a large train of his  subjects unarmed, making signs of peace.  The chief was naked, and  painted after the fashion of the country.  Seated on a stone, he  received the Adelantado with great courtesy, and acceding to his wishes  to visit the interior of his dominions, supplied him with three guides  to conduct him to the mines.    Leaving a party to guard the boats, the Adelantado set off on foot with  the remainder, sleeping one night on the road.  After travelling about  six leagues, they entered a forest, where the guides informed them the  mines were situated.  The whole soil indeed seemed to be impregnated  with gold, and in the space of two hours each Spaniard had collected a  considerable quantity from among the roots of the trees.    Reaching the top of a hill, the guides pointed out to the Adelantado a  wide forest region, which they assured him, for a distance of twenty  leagues, abounded with gold.  It appeared, however, that by the  directions of Quibian they had deceived him, and taken him to the mines  of a neighbouring cacique, with whom he was at war, and that the real  mines of Veragua were nearer and far more wealthy.    After this the indefatigable Adelantado made another exploring  expedition along the coast and through the interior, from which he  returned well laden with gold.  Columbus, satisfied that the mines of  Veragua and those of the Aurea Chersonesus were identical, considered  that this would be a suitable place to found a colony and establish a  mart which should become the emporium of a vast tract of mines.  The  Adelantado agreed with him, and offered to remain with the greater part  of the people while the Admiral should return to Spain for  reinforcements and supplies.    Eighty men were selected to remain, and they immediately set about  building dwellings and a store-house within bowshot of the river Belen.  Columbus endeavoured to conciliate the good-will of the Indians, that  they might bring provisions to the colony, and he made many presents to  Quibian to reconcile him to this intrusion into his territories.    When an attempt was made, however, to carry the vessels over the bar, it  was found there was not sufficient water for them.  They had to wait for  the periodical swelling of the river before this could be accomplished.    Columbus was satisfied with the good disposition of the natives, but the  chief notary, Diego Mendez, his attached friend, had some doubts about  the matter, and offered to sally forth and visit a large Indian camp  which it was discovered had been formed in the neighbourhood.    Rowing up the river in a strongly-armed boat, he suddenly came upon a  thousand or more Indians evidently on a warlike expedition.  Landing  alone, he offered to accompany them.  This proposition was received in a  suspicious manner, and he returned to his boat.  Watching narrowly  during the night, he perceived that they went back to Veragua.    Hastening to the Admiral, he expressed his opinion that the Indians  intended to surprise the settlement.  Further to ascertain the  intentions of Quibian, he undertook to penetrate to his head-quarters.  Accompanied by one Rodrigo Escobar, he made his way to the mouth of the  Veragua, where he induced two Indians to convey him and his companion up  the river.    On reaching the village of the chief, the two Spaniards observed a  bustle of warlike preparation, and heard that Quibian was confined to  his house by a wound.  Mendez on this announced that he was a surgeon,  and offered to cure the chief of his wound.  Making his way towards the  chief's residence, he came upon an open space where he saw raised on  posts the heads of three hundred enemies of the tribe slain in battle.    As he approached the house, a powerful Indian--son of the cacique--  rushed out and struck him a blow; but Mendez producing a box of  ointment, pacified him.  Though unable to gain access to the cacique, he  escaped without further injury to the boat, and he and his companion  made their way down to the harbour.    It was evident that the natives intended hostilities, and from an Indian  who had become attached to the Spaniards they learned that Quibian  intended to surprise the Spaniards by night, to burn the vessels and  houses, and make a general massacre.  To prevent him carrying out his  plan, the Adelantado offered to go up the river and capture him and his  principal chiefs and family during the night, and to bring them in  chains on board.    Taking Diego Mendez, with seventy men and an interpreter, he set off on  the 30th of March.  Reaching the neighbourhood of the village, he left  the rest of his people, and, accompanied by Diego Mendez and four  others, went forward.  The remainder, two and two, climbed the hill.  It  was arranged that upon the discharge of an arquebus they were to  surround the dwelling and suffer no one to escape.    As the Adelantado approached, Quibian came out to meet him, and seated  himself in the porch; Don Bartholomew telling Mendez and his companions  to remain at a little distance, and that when they should see him take  the cacique by the arm, to rush immediately to his assistance.    He then advanced with his Indian interpreter, and after a short  conversation, pretending to examine the cacique's wound, he took him by  the arm.    At the concerted signal four of the Spaniards rushed forward, the fifth  discharged his arquebus.  The cacique attempted to get loose, but was  held firm in the iron grasp of the Adelantado.  A violent struggle  ensued, but Diego Mendez and the rest coming up, Quibian was bound hand  and foot; and at the report of the arquebus the main body of the  Spaniards surrounded the house and seized all who were within, the wives  and children of Quibian included.  When the savages saw their chief a  captive, with loud cries they implored his liberty, offering a rich  treasure as his ransom.    The Adelantado, deaf to their entreaties, carried off Quibian and the  other prisoners to the boat, committing them to the charge of Juan  Sanchez, the principal pilot, while he remained on shore with part of  his men to secure the Indians who had escaped.    The night was dark, and as the boats proceeded down the river Quibian  pretended that the cord which bound him to a bench hurt his limbs, and  the pilot loosed it.    The wily Indian, watching his opportunity, plunged into the water, and  in the darkness and confusion it was not known whether he sank or  reached the bank.  Sanchez, crestfallen, returned in the boats to the  ships.    The next morning the Adelantado, seeing from the nature of the country  that it would be impossible to overtake the fugitives, contented himself  with carrying off all the coronets, necklaces, and plates of gold found  in the cacique's mansion, to the value of three hundred ducats, and got  safely on board.    Columbus, believing that Quibian had perished and that the vigorous  measures of the Adelantado had succeeded in quelling the natives, made  preparations for sailing.  The river having swollen, he got three of the  caravels over the bar by landing their cargoes, but left the fourth for  the use of the settlement.  Taking leave of his brother, and making his  final arrangements, he set sail."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#19)"],[1,"soft couches were  spread for the guests.    The Spartan supper, on the contrary, was of the plainest description,  and was served in ordinary earthenware. Pausanias called his officers  and men, and, after pointing out the difference between the Spartan and  the Persian style of living, he showed how much he liked plain food by  eating his usual supper.    To reward Pausanias for his bravery and for defeating the enemy, the  Greeks gave him a part of all that was best in the spoil. Next they set  aside one tenth of it for Apollo, and sent it to his priests at Delphi  as a token of gratitude for the favor of the god.    To show that they were grateful also to Zeus and Poseidon,--the gods  who, they thought, had helped them to win their battles by land and by  sea,--they sent statues to Olympia and Corinth; and they erected a  temple in honor of Athene, the goddess of defensive war, on the  battlefield of Plataea.          LIV. THE REBUILDING OF ATHENS.      The Persians had been driven out of Greece, and the war with them was  now carried on in Asia Minor instead of nearer home. The Greek army won  many battles here also, and even managed to free the city of Miletus  from the Persian yoke.    These triumphs encouraged all the Ionian cities, and they soon formed a  league with the other Greeks, promising to help them against the  Persians should the war ever be renewed. As soon as this alliance was  made, the Greek fleet returned home, bringing back to Athens as a trophy  the chains with which Xerxes had pretended to bind the rebellious sea.    In the mean while the Athenians, who had taken refuge on the  Peloponnesus, had returned to their native city, where, alas! they found  their houses and temples in ruins. The desolation was great; yet the  people were so thankful to return, that they prepared to rebuild the  town.    They were greatly encouraged in this purpose by an event which seemed to  them a good omen. Near the temple of the patron goddess of Athens stood  a sacred olive tree, supposed to have been created by her at the time  when the city received her name.    This place had been burned by the invaders, and the returning Athenians  sorrowfully gazed upon the blackened trunk of the sacred tree. Imagine  their delight, therefore, when a new shoot suddenly sprang up from the  ashes, and put forth leaves with marvelous speed.    The people all cried that the goddess had sent them this sign of her  continued favor to encourage them to rebuild the city, and they worked  with such energy that they were soon provided with new homes.    As soon as the Athenians had secured shelter for their families, they  began to restore the mighty walls which had been the pride of their  city. When the Spartans heard of this, they jealously objected, for they  were afraid that Athens would become more powerful than Sparta.    Of course, they did not want to own that they were influenced by so mean  a feeling as jealousy, so they tried to find a pretext to hinder the  work. This was soon found, and Spartan messengers came and told the  Athenians that they should not fortify the town, lest it should fall  again into the hands of the enemy, and serve them as a stronghold.    Themistocles suspected the real cause of these objections, and made up  his mind to use all his talents to help his fellow-citizens. He  therefore secretly assembled the most able men, and told them to go on  with the work as fast as possible, while he went to Sparta to talk over  the matter with the Lacedaemonians.    When he arrived at Sparta, he artfully prolonged the discussions until  the walls were built high enough to be defended. Of course, there was  now nothing to be done; but the Spartans were very angry, and waited  anxiously for an opportunity to punish the Athenians. This came after a  time, as you will see in the following chapters.          LV. DEATH OF PAUSANIAS.      Pausanias, the Spartan king, was very proud of the great victory he had  won over the Persians at Plataea, and of the praise and booty he had  received. He was so proud of it, that he soon became unbearable, and  even wanted to become ruler of all Greece.    Although he had at first pretended to despise the luxury which he had  seen in the tent of Mardonius, he soon began to put on the Persian dress  and to copy their manners, and demanded much homage from his subjects.  This greatly displeased the simple Greeks, and he soon saw that they  would not help him to become sole king.    In his ambition to rule alone, he entirely forgot all that was right,  and, turning traitor, secretly offered to help the Persians if they  would promise to make him king over all Greece.    This base plot was found out by the ephors, the officers whose duty it  was to watch the kings, and they ordered his own guards to seize him.  Before this order could be carried out, however, Pausanias fled, and  took refuge in a neighboring temple, where, of course, no one could lay  violent hands upon him.    As the ephors feared he might even yet escape to Persia, and carry out  his wicked plans, they ordered that the doors and windows of the temple  should all be walled up.    It is said that as soon as this command had been given, Pausanias'  mother brought the first stone, saying she preferred that her son should  die, rather than live to be a traitor.    Thus walled in, Pausanias slowly starved to death, and the barriers were  torn down only just in time to allow him to be carried out, and breathe  his last in the open air. The Spartans would not let him die in the  temple, because they thought his dying breath would offend the gods.    As Themistocles had been a great friend of Pausanias, he was accused of  sharing his plans. The Athenians therefore rose up against him in anger,  ostracized him, and drove him out of the country to end his life in  exile.    After wandering aimlessly about for some time, Themistocles finally went  to the court of Ar-tax-erx'es, the son and successor of Xerxes.    The Persian monarch, we are told, welcomed him warmly, gave him a  Persian wife, and set aside three cities to supply him with bread, meat,  and wine. Themistocles soon grew very rich, and lived on the fat of the  land; and a traveler said that he once exclaimed, \"How much we should  have lost, my children and I, had we not been ruined by the Athenians!\"    Artaxerxes, having thus provided for all Themistocles' wants, and helped  him to pile up riches, fancied that his gratitude would lead him to  perform any service the king might ask. He therefore sent for  Themistocles one day, and bade him lead a Persian army against the  Greeks.    But, although Themistocles had been exiled from his country, he had not  fallen low enough to turn traitor. He proudly refused to fight; and it  is said that he preferred to commit suicide, rather than injure the  people he had once loved so dearly.          LVI. CIMON IMPROVES ATHENS.      As soon as Themistocles had been banished from Athens, Aristides again  became the chief man of the city, and he was also made the head and  leader of the allies. He was so upright and just that all were ready to  honor and obey him, and they gladly let him take charge of the money of  the state.    In reward for his services, the Athenians offered him a large salary and  many rich gifts; but he refused them all, saying that he needed nothing,  and could afford to serve his country without pay.    He therefore went on seeing to all the public affairs until his death,  when it was found that he was so poor that there was not enough money  left to pay for his funeral. The Athenians, touched by his virtues, gave  him a public burial, held his name in great honor, and often regretted  that they had once been so ungrateful as to banish their greatest  citizen, Aristides the Just.    As Aristides had watched carefully over the money of the allied states,  and had ruled the Athenians very wisely, it is no wonder that Athens had  little by little risen above Sparta, which had occupied the first place  ever since the battle of Thermopylae.    The Athenians, as long as Aristides lived, showed themselves just and  liberal; but as soon as he was dead, they began to treat their former  allies unkindly. The money which all the Greek states furnished was now  no longer used to strengthen the army and navy, as first agreed, but was  lavishly spent to beautify the city.    Now, while it was a good thing to make their town as fine as possible,  it was certainly wrong to use the money of others for this purpose, and  the Athenians were soon punished for their dishonesty.    Cimon, the son of Miltiades, was made the head of the army, and won  several victories over the Persians in Asia Minor. When he returned to  Athens, he brought back a great deal of spoil, and generously gave up  all his share to improve the city and strengthen the walls.    [Illustration: The Theseum.]    It is said that Cimon also enlarged the beautiful gardens of the  A-cad'e-my; and the citizens, by wandering up and down the shady walks,  showed that they liked this as well as the Lyceum, which, you will  remember, Pisistratus had given them.    They also went in crowds to these gardens to hear the philosophers, who  taught in the cool porticoes or stone piazzas built all around them, and  there they learned many good things.    Cimon showed his patriotism in still another way by persuading the  people that the remains of Theseus, their ancient king, should rest in  the city. Theseus' bones were therefore brought from Scyros, the island  where he had been killed so treacherously, and were buried near the  center of Athens, where the resting-place of this great man was marked  by a temple called the The-se'um. A building of this name is still  standing in the city; and, although somewhat damaged, it is now used as  a museum, and contains a fine statue of Theseus.          LVII. THE EARTHQUAKE.
