I expect the green  stains on my coat reminded him. I got them hauling up his precious dog.\"    \"It wasn't with him in the wood.\"    \"Oh, it's sitting by the fire drinking linseed tea! It looked a pampered  brute.\"    \"We shall have to scoot to keep clear of Teddie.\"    \"All right. Scooterons-nous. Thank goodness, there's the hedge of The  Woodlands! We'll slip in through the little side gate.\"    The three certainly merited discovery for their misdeeds, but on this  occasion they evaded justice; for, as luck would have it, they reached  the house just a moment or two before the rest of the school, and Miss  Teddington, who was in a hurry to pack her boxes of snowdrops, concluded  that they must have been in front with Ulyth and Lizzie, and did not  stop to remember that she had left them tying Winnie's shoelace by the  roadside. It was seldom that such a palpable lapse escaped her keen eye  and even keener comprehension; so they might thank their fortunate stars  for their escape. Hattie and Winnie made great capital out of the  adventure, and recounted all the details, much exaggerated, to a  thrilled audience in IV B.    Rona did not mention the matter to Ulyth. Perhaps, knowing her  room-mate's standards, in her heart of hearts she was rather ashamed of  it.          CHAPTER XI    Rona receives News      Ulyth and Lizzie Lonsdale were sitting cosily in the latter's bedroom.  It was Shrove Tuesday, and, with perhaps some idea of imitating the  Continental habit of keeping carnival, Miss Bowes for that one day  relaxed her rule prohibiting sweets, and allowed the school a special  indulgence. Needless to say, they availed themselves of it to the  fullest extent. Some had boxes of chocolate sent them from home; others  visited the village shop and purchased delicacies from the big bottles  displayed in the windows; while a favoured few managed to borrow pans  from the kitchen and perform some cookery with the aid of friends.  Lizzie had been concocting peppermint creams, and she now leant back  luxuriously in a basket-chair and handed the box to Ulyth. The two girls  were friends, and often met for a chat. Ulyth sometimes wished they  could be room-mates. Though Rona was immensely improved, she was still  not an entirely congenial companion. Her lack of education and early  training made it difficult for her to understand half the things Ulyth  wanted to talk about, and it was troublesome always to have to explain.  In an equal friendship there must be give and take, and to poor Rona  Ulyth was constantly giving her very best, and receiving nothing in  return. Lizzie, on the contrary, was inspiring. She played and painted  well, was fond of reading, and was ready to help to organize any forward  movement in the school. She and Ulyth pottered together over  photography, mounted specimens for the museum, tried new stitches in  embroidery, and worked at the same patterns in chip carving. The two  girls were at about the same level of attainment in most things, for if  Ulyth had greater originality, Lizzie was the more steady and plodding.  It was Ulyth's failing to take things up very hotly at first, and then  grow tired of them. She was apt to have half a dozen unfinished pieces  of fancywork on hand, and her locker in the carpentry-room held several  ambitious attempts that had never reached fruition.    Lizzie, as she munched her peppermint creams, turned over the pages of a  volume of Dryden's poems, and made an occasional note. Each form kept a  \"Calendar of Quotations\" hung up in its classroom, the daily extracts  for which were supplied by the girls in rotation. It was Lizzie's turn  to provide the gems for the following week, and she was hunting for  something suitable.    \"I wish Miss Bowes had given me Shakespeare,\" she said. \"I could have  got heaps of bits out of my birthday-book, just suitable for the month,  too. I don't know why she should have pitched on Dryden. No one's going  to be particularly cheered next week with my quotations. I've got:    \"'MONDAY        \"'When I consider life, 't is all a cheat;        Yet, fooled with hope, men favour the deceit,        Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay;        To-morrow's falser than the former day.'    \"'TUESDAY        \"'All human things are subject to decay,        And when Fate summons, monarchs must obey.'\"    \"That's dismal, in all conscience!\" put in Ulyth.    \"'WEDNESDAY        \"'Great wits are sure to madness near allied,        And thin partitions do their bounds divide.'    \"That sounds quite as dismal, does it not? I wonder why Scott calls  Dryden 'glorious John'? I think he's rather a dismal poet. Listen to  this:        \"'In dreams they fearful precipices tread,        Or, shipwrecked, labour to some distant shore,        Or in dark churches walk amongst the dead:        They wake with horror, and dare sleep no more.'    Shall I put it down for Thursday?\"    \"For goodness' sake don't! You'll give us all the creeps,\" laughed  Ulyth.    \"Well, it won't be a champion week.\"    \"I'll tell you what you might do. Draw some illustrations round the  mottoes. That would make them more interesting.\"    \"Oh, I dare say! I haven't time to bother.\"    \"Nonsense, you have! I'll do some of them for you. You needn't be  original. It doesn't take long to copy things.\"    \"Will you do four, then, if I do three?\"    \"All serene. I'll begin this evening if you'll give me the cards.\"    Ulyth dashed off quite a pretty little pen-and-ink sketch in ten minutes  after tea, and put the cards by in her drawer, intending to finish them  during \"handicraft hour\" the next day; but she completely forgot all  about them, and never remembered their existence till Saturday, when she  came across them by accident, and was much dismayed at her discovery.    \"I'll have to do them somehow, or Lizzie'll never forgive me,\" she  ruminated. \"I must knock them off just as fast as I can. I could copy  those little figures from the _American Gems_; they're in outline, and  will be very easy. Oh, bother! It's cataloguing day, and one's not  supposed to use the library. What atrocious luck!\"    Twice during the term the books of the school library were called in for  purposes of review by the librarian, and on those days nobody was  allowed to borrow any of the volumes. It was most unfortunate for Ulyth  that this special Saturday should be the one devoted by the monitresses  to the purpose. She had failed Lizzie so often before in their joint  projects that she did not wish to encounter fresh reproaches. Somehow  three illustrations had to be provided, and that within the space of  about half an hour. Ulyth was fairly clever at drawing, but she was not  capable of producing the pictures out of her head. She must obtain a  copy, and that quickly.    \"Helen Cooper's librarian this month,\" she thought. \"I wonder if she's  finished checking the catalogue yet? I saw her walking down the stream  five minutes ago with Mabel Hoyle. Why shouldn't I have the _American  Gems_ for half an hour? It wouldn't do any harm. It really is the merest  red tape that we mayn't use the books. I shall just take French leave  and borrow it.\"    Ulyth went at once to the library. Helen had evidently been at work  there, for the list lay open, with a sheet of paper near, recording the  condition of some of the copies. A glue-pot and some rolls of  transparent gummed edging showed that Helen had been busy mending  battered covers and torn pages. She probably meant to finish them after  tea. The book of American gems was in its usual place on the shelf. The  temptation was irresistible. Ulyth did not notice, as she was taking it  down, that someone with a smooth head of sleek fair hair was peeping  round the corner of the door, and that a pair of not too friendly blue  eyes were watching the deed. If flying footsteps whisked along the  corridor and out into the garden, she was blissfully unconscious of the  fact. She took the volume to her own form-room and settled herself at  her desk with her drawing materials, cardboard, pencil, india-rubber,  fine pen, and a bottle of Indian ink. The little figures were exactly  what she wanted, quite simple in outline, but most effective, and not at  all difficult. They would certainly improve Lizzie's calendar for the  week, and relieve the sombre character of the Dryden quotations. She  worked away very rapidly, sketching them lightly in pencil, intending to  finish them in ink afterwards. She grew quite interested, especially  when she reached the pen part. That little face with its laughing mouth  and aureole of hair was really very pretty; she had copied it without  having to use the india-rubber once.    \"Ulyth Stanton, what are you doing with that book?\" said a voice from  behind her desk.    Beside her stood Helen Cooper and Stephanie Radford, the former hugely  indignant, the latter with a non-committal expression. Ulyth started so  violently that the bottle of Indian ink overturned and spread itself out  in three streams.    \"Oh Jemima!\" shrieked Ulyth in consternation.    \"Now you've done it!\" exclaimed Helen angrily. \"Ink all over the page.  What a disgraceful mess! For goodness' sake stop; you're making it  worse. Give it to me.\"    Ulyth, who was frantically mopping up the black streams with her pocket  handkerchief, surrendered the book to the outraged librarian. Nemesis  had indeed descended upon her guilty head.    \"You knew perfectly well that you weren't allowed to take it to-day,\"  scolded Helen. \"You sneaked into the library and got it while I was  out.\"    \"Someone else has been sneaking too,\" thought Ulyth, with a glance at  Stephanie's face. \"I fancy I know who turned informer.\" Then aloud"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20733"],[0,"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 1 of 3), Essay 1: Robespierre (#19)"],[1,"house. Only a few days before Cecile Renault's  visit to Robespierre, an assassin had fired a pistol at Collot d'Herbois  on the staircase of his apartment. We may make allowance for the  excitement of the hour, and Robespierre had as much right to play the  martyr, as had Lewis the Fifteenth after the incident of Damiens' rusty  pen-knife. But the histrionic exigencies of the chief of a faction ought  not to be pushed too far. And it was a monstrous crime that because  Robespierre found it convenient to pose as sacrificial victim at the  Club, therefore he should have had no scruple in seeing not only the  wretched Cecile, but her father, her aunt, and one of her brothers, all  despatched to the guillotine in the red shirt of parricide, as agents of  Pitt and Coburg, and assassins of the father of the land. This was  exactly two days after he had shown his decisive power in the affair of  the religious illuminists. The only possible conclusion open to a plain  man after weighing and putting aside all the sophisms with which this  affair has been obscured, is that Robespierre interfered in the one case  because its further prosecution would have tended to make him  ridiculous, and he did not interfere in the other, because the more  exaggerated, the more melodramatic, the more murderous it was made, the  more interesting an object would he seem in the eyes of his adorers.    The second fact bearing on Robespierre's humanity is this. He had  encouraged the formation and stimulated the activity of popular  commissions, who should provide victims for the Revolutionary Tribunal.  On the Second of Messidor (June 20) a list containing one hundred and  thirty-eight names was submitted for the ratification of the Committee.  The Committee endorsed the bloody document, and the last signature of  the endorsement is that of him, who had resigned a post in his youth  rather than be a party to putting a man to death. As was observed at the  time, Robespierre in doing this, suppressed his pique against his  colleagues, in order to take part in a measure, that was a sort of  complement to his Law of Prairial.    From these two circumstances, then, even if there were no other, we are  justified in inferring that Robespierre was struck by no remorse at the  thought that it was his law which had unbound the hands of the horrible  genie of civil murder. His mind was wholly absorbed in the calculations  of a frigid egoism. His intelligence, as we have always to remember, was  very dim. He only aimed at one thing at once, and that was seldom  anything very great or far-reaching. He was a man of peering and  obscured vision in face of practical affairs. In passing the Law of  Prairial, his designs--and they were meritorious and creditable designs  enough in themselves--had been directed against the corrupt chiefs, such  as Tallien and Fouche, and against the fierce and coarse spirits of the  Committee of General Security, such as Vadier and Voulland. Robespierre  was above all things a precisian. He had a sentimental sympathy with the  common people in the abstract, but his spiritual pride, his pedantry,  his formalism, his personal fastidiousness, were all wounded to the very  quick by the kind of men whom the Revolution had thrown to the surface.  Gouverneur Morris, then the American minister, describes most of the  members of the two Committees as the very dregs of humanity, with whom  it is a stain to have any dealings; as degraded men only worthy of the  profoundest contempt. Danton had said: 'Robespierre is the least of a  scoundrel of any of the band.' The Committee of General Security  represented the very elements by which Robespierre was most revolted.  They offended his respectability; their evil manners seemed to tarnish  that good name which his vanity hoped to make as revered all over  Europe, as it already was among his partisans in France. It was  indispensable therefore to cut them off from the revolutionary  government, just as Hebert and as Danton had been cut off. His  colleagues of Public Safety refused to lend themselves to this.  Henceforth, with characteristically narrow tenacity, he looked round for  new combinations, but, so far as I can see, with no broader design than  to enable him to punish these particular objects of his very just  detestation.    The position of sections and interests which ended in the Revolution of  Thermidor, is one of the most extraordinarily intricate and entangled in  the history of faction. It would take a volume to follow out all the  peripeteias of the drama. Here we can only enumerate in a few sentences  the parties to the contest and the conditions of the game. The reader  will easily discern the difficulty in Robespierre's way of making an  effective combination. First, there were the two Committees. Of these  the one, the General Security, was thoroughly hostile to Robespierre;  its members, as we have said, were wild and hardy spirits, with no  political conception, and with a great contempt for fine phrases and  philosophical principles. They knew Robespierre's hatred for them, and  they heartily returned it. They were the steadfast centre of the  changing schemes which ended in his downfall. The Committee of Public  Safety was divided. Carnot hated Saint Just, and Collot d'Herbois hated  Robespierre, and Billaud had a sombre distrust of Robespierre's  counsels. Shortly speaking, the object of the Billaudists was to retain  their power, and their power was always menaced from two quarters, the  Convention and Paris. If they let Robespierre have his own way against  his enemies, would they not be at his mercy whenever he chose to devise  a popular insurrection against them? Yet if they withstood Robespierre,  they could only do so through the agency of the Convention, and to fall  back upon the Convention would be to give that body an express  invitation to resume the power that had, in the pressure of the crisis a  year before, been delegated to the Committee, and periodically renewed  afterwards. The dilemma of Billaud seemed desperate, and events  afterwards proved that it was so.    If we turn to the Convention, we find the position equally distracting.  They, too, feared another insurrection and a second decimation. If the  Right helped Robespierre to destroy the Fouches and Vadiers, he would be  stronger than ever; and what security had they against a repetition of  the violence of the Thirty-first of May? If the Dantonists joined in  destroying Robespierre, they would be helping the Right, and what  security had they against a Girondin reaction? On the other hand, the  Centre might fairly hope, just what Billaud feared, that if the  Committee came to the Convention to crush Robespierre, that would end in  a combination strong enough to enable the Convention to crush the  Committees.    Much depended on military success. The victories of the generals were  the great strength of the Committee. For so long it would be difficult  to turn opinion against a triumphant administration. 'At the first  defeat,' Robespierre had said to Barere, 'I await you.' But the defeat  did not come. The plotting went on with incessant activity; on one hand,  Robespierre, aided by Saint Just and Couthon, strengthening himself at  the Jacobin Club, and through that among the sections; on the other, the  Mountain and the Committee of General Security trying to win over the  Right, more contemptuously christened the Marsh or the Belly, of the  Convention. The Committee of Public Safety was not yet fully decided how  to act.    At the end of the first week of Thermidor, Robespierre could endure the  tension no longer. He had tried to fortify his nerves for the struggle  by riding, but with so little success that he was lifted off his horse  fainting. He endeavoured to steady himself by diligent pistol-practice.  But nothing gave him initiative and the sinews of action. Saint Just  urged him to raise Paris. Some bold men proposed to carry off the  members of the Committee bodily from their midnight deliberations.  Robespierre declined, and fell back on what he took to be his greatest  strength and most unfailing resource; he prepared a speech. On the  Eighth of Thermidor he delivered it to the Convention, amid intense  excitement both within its walls and without. All Paris knew that they  were now on the eve of one more of the famous Days; the revolution of  Thermidor had begun.    The speech of the Eighth Thermidor has seemed to men of all parties  since a masterpiece of tactical ineptitude. If Robespierre had been a  statesman instead of a phrasemonger, he had a clear course. He ought to  have taken the line of argument that Danton would have taken. That is to  say, he ought to have identified himself fully with the interests and  security of the Convention; to have accepted the growing resolution to  close the Terror; to have boldly pressed the abolition of the Committee  of General Security, and the removal from the Committee of Public Safety  of Billaud, Collot, Barere; to have proposed to send about fifty persons  to Cayenne for life; and to have urged a policy of peace with the  foreign powers. This was the substantial wisdom and real interest of the  position. The task was difficult, because his hearers had the best  possible reasons for knowing that the author of the Law of Prairial was  a Terrorist on principle. And in truth we know that Robespierre had no  definite intention of erecting clemency into a rule. He had not mental  strength enough to throw off the profound apprehension, which the  incessant alarms of the last five years had engendered in him; and the  only device, that he could imagine for maintaining the republic against  traitors, was to stimulate the rigour of the Revolutionary Tribunal.    If, however, Robespierre lacked the grasp which might have made him the  representative of a broad and stable policy, it was at least his  interest to persuade the men of"]]]
