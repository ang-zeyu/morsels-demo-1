The colonel opened fire; the biggest cow dropped to her knees and in an  instant the air was thunderous with the excited \"milling\" of the herd of  elephants. For several anxious minutes the spot was the scene of much  confusion, and when quiet was once more restored Colonel Roosevelt had  killed three elephants and Kermit had killed one of the calves. It had  not been intended or desired to kill more than two of the cows, but with  a herd of angry elephants threatening to annihilate an attacking party,  sometimes the prearranged plans do not work out according to  specifications.    Kermit was hastily despatched to notify our camp and the work of  preparing the skins of the elephants was at once begun.    In the meantime, we at our camp, eight miles away from the scene of  battle, were waiting eagerly for news of the hunting party, although  expecting nothing for a day of so. It seemed too much to expect that the  hunt should have such a quick and successful termination. So when Kermit  rode in with the news late in the afternoon it was a time for  felicitation. We all solemnly took a drink, which in itself was an  event, for our camp was a \"dry\" camp when in the field. Only the killing  of a lion had been sufficient provocation for taking off the \"lid,\" but  on the strength of three elephants for the group the \"lid\" was  momentarily raised with much ceremony and circumstance.    The burden of Kermit's message was \"salt, salt, salt!\" and porters and  second gunbearers to help with the skinning. So James L. Clark, who has  been connected with the American Museum of History for some time and who  was with us on the Mount Elgon trip to help Mr. Akeley with the  preparation of the group, started off with a lot of porters laden with  salt for preserving the skins. It was his plan to go direct to the main  Roosevelt camp, get a guide, and then push on to the elephant camp,  where he hoped to arrive by ten o'clock at night. He would then be in  time to help with the skinning, which we expected would be continued  throughout the entire night. Kermit stopped at his own camp and gave  Clark a guide for the rest of the journey, after which he went to bed.    At eleven o'clock the sound of firing was heard some place off in the  darkness. The night guard of the Roosevelt camp, rightly construing it  to be a signal, answered it with a shot, and, guided by the latter,  Clark and his party of salt-laden porters once more appeared. They had  traveled in a circle for three hours and were hopelessly lost. Kermit  was routed out and again supplied more guides--also a compass and also  the direction to follow. Unfortunately he made a mistake and said  northwest instead of southeast--otherwise his directions were perfect.    For three hours more Clark and his porters went bumping through the  night, stumbling through the long grass and falling into hidden holes.  The porters began to be mutinous and the guides were thoroughly and  hopelessly lost. It was then that they one and all laid down in the tall  grass, made a fire to keep the lions and leopards away, and slept  soundly until daylight. Even then the situation was little better, for  the guides were still at sea. About the time that Clark decided, to  return to the river, miles away, and take a fresh start, he fired a shot  in the forlorn hope of getting a response from some section of the  compass. A distant shot came in answer and he pushed on and soon came up  with the colonel and Tarlton returning home after a night in the  temporary elephant camp. The colonel gave him full directions and at  nine o'clock the relief party arrived at their destination.    In the meantime we, Mrs. Akeley, Stephenson and myself, had left our  camp on the river at six-fifteen, gone to the Roosevelt camp, and with  Kermit guiding us proceeded on across country toward the elephant camp.  On our way we also met the colonel and Tarlton, the former immensely  pleased with the outcome of the hunt and full of enthusiasm about the  adventure with the elephants. But the most remarkable thing of all, he  said, was the hyena incident. He told us the story, and it is surely one  that will make all nature fakers sit up in an incredulous and dissenting  mood.    During the night, the story goes, many hyenas had come from far and near  to gorge on the carcasses of the elephants. Their howls filled the night  with weird sounds. Lions also journeyed to the feast, and between the  two they mumbled the bones of the slain with many a howl and snarl.  Early in the morning the colonel went out in the hope of surprising a  lion at the spread. Instead, to his great amazement, he saw the head of  a hyena protruding from the distended side of the largest elephant. It  was inside the elephant and was looking out, as through a window. A  single shot finished the hyena, after which a more careful examination  was made.    There are two theories as to what really happened. One is that the hyena  ate its way into the inside of the elephant, then gorged itself so that  its stomach was distended to such proportions that it couldn't get  through the hole by which it had entered the carcass.    [Drawing: _The Hyena Episode_]    The other theory is that, after eating its way into the elephant, it  started to eat its way out by a different route. When its head emerged  the heavy muscles of the elephant's side inclosed about its neck like a  vise, entrapping the hyena as effectively as though it had its head in a  steel trap. In the animal's despairing efforts to escape it had kicked  one leg out through the thick walls of the elephant's side.    [Photograph: Kermit Roosevelt]    [Photograph: \"Peeling\" an elephant]    The colonel, in parting, asked us to stop with him for lunch on our way  back and he would tell us all about the elephant hunt and show us his  pigskin library. In return we promised to photograph the hyena and thus  be prepared to render expert testimony in case, some time in the future,  he might get into a controversy with the nature fakers as to the truth  of the incident.    We then resumed our journey and arrived at the elephant camp at  nine-thirty. It was a scene of industry. The skins of the two largest  elephants and that of the calf had been removed the afternoon before and  were spread out under a cluster of trees. Twenty or thirty porters were  squatted around the various ears and strips of hide and massive feet,  paring off all the little particles of flesh or tissue that remained. As  fast as a section of hide was stripped it was thickly covered with salt  and rolled up. This is the preliminary step. Afterwards the skin, in  many places an inch in thickness, is pared down to a condition of  pliable thinness. This work requires hours or even days of hard labor by  many skilful wielders of the paring knife. The skulls and many of the  bones are saved when an animal is being preserved for a museum, but when  we arrived they had not yet been removed from the carcasses.    Our first object was to visit the hyena, which we found still protruding  from the side of his tomb. We photographed him from all angles, after  which he was disinterred and exposed to full view. He had certainly died  happy. He had literally eaten himself to death, and his body was so  distended from gorging that it was as round as a ball. Colonel Roosevelt  also photographed it, so that there will be no lack of evidence if the  incident ever reaches the controversial stage.    The third cow killed by Colonel Roosevelt was too small for the group,  so the skin was divided up as souvenirs of the day. We each got a foot,  fifteen square feet of skin, and one of the ears was saved for the  colonel.    We then started on the long two hours' ride back to the Roosevelt camp,  arriving there at a few minutes before one o'clock. We had not been in  camp ten minutes before a whirlwind came along, blew down a tent, and in  another minute was gone.    A big American flag was flying from the colonel's tent, and he came out  and, greeted us with the utmost cordiality and warmth. In honor of the  occasion he had put on his coat and a green knit tie. He was beaming  with pleasure at the result of the elephant hunt and seemed proud that  he was to have elephants in the American Museum group to be done by Mr.  Akeley. Heller was stuffing some birds and mice and was as slouchy,  deliberate and as full of dry humor as any one I've ever seen. He is a  character of a most likable type. Tarlton, small, with short cropped red  hair--a sort of Scotchman in appearance--is also a remarkable type. He  has a quiet voice, never raised in tone, and talks like the university  man that he is. He is a famous lion hunter and has killed numbers of  lions and elephants, but now he says he is through with dangerous game.    \"I've had enough of it,\" he says.    The colonel, Tarlton, Heller, and Kermit were the only members of the  expedition present, Mearns and Loring having been engaged in a separate  mission up in the Kenia country for several weeks, while Cuninghame had  gone to Uganda to make preparations for the future operations of the  party in that country.    Mrs. Akeley washed up in the colonel's tent, while Stephenson and I used  Kermit's tent, and as we washed and scrubbed away the memories of the  elephant carcasses the colonel stood in the door and talked to us.    We told him that each of us had taken a drink of Scotch whisky the  evening before in honor of the elephants--the first drinks we had taken  for weeks.    \"I'd do the same,\" said the colonel, \"but I don't like Scotch whisky. As  a matter of fact, I have taken only three drinks of brandy since I've  been in Africa, twice when I was exhausted and once when I was feeling a  little feverish. Before I left Washington "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#19)"],[1," and hurled me from him so that I came to the floor  crashingly half under my writing-table!    Something he cried back at me, furiously--and like an enraged animal,  his teeth gleaming out from his beard, he darted from the room.  The  front door banged loudly.    Shaken and quivering, I got upon my feet.  On the threshold, in a  state of pitiable hesitancy, stood the pale, beautiful accomplice  of Earl Dexter.  One quick glance she flashed at me, then turned  and ran!    Again the door slammed.  I ran to the window, looking out into the  court.  The girl came hurrying down the steps, and with never a  backward glance ran on and was lost to view in one of the passages  opening riverward.    Out under the arch, statelily passed a tall figure--and Inspector  Bristol was entering!  I saw the detective glance aside as the two  all but met.  He stood still, and looked back!    \"Bristol!\" I cried, and waved my arms frantically.    \"Stop him!  Stop him!  It's Hassan of Aleppo!\"    Bristol was not the only one to hear my wild cry--not the only one  to dash back under the arch and out into Fleet Street.    But Hassan of Aleppo was gone!          CHAPTER XXII    THE LIGHT OF EL-MEDINEH      Bristol and I walked slowly in the direction of the entrance of the  British Antiquarian Museum.  It was the day following upon the  sensational scene in my chambers.    \"There's very little doubt,\" said Bristol, \"that Earl Dexter has  the slipper and that Hassan of Aleppo knows where Dexter is in  hiding.  I don't know which of the two is more elusive.  Hassan  apparently melted into thin air yesterday; and although The Stetson  Man has never within my experience employed disguises, no one has  set eyes upon him since the night that he vanished from his lodgings  off the Waterloo Road.  It's always possible for a man to baffle  the police by remaining closely within doors, but during all the  time that has elapsed Dexter must have taken a little exercise  occasionally, and the missing hand should have betrayed him.\"    \"The wonder to me is,\" I replied, \"that he has escaped death at the  hands of the Hashishin.  He is a supremely daring man, for I should  think that he must be carrying the slipper of the Prophet about  with him!\"    \"I would rather he did it than I!\" commented Bristol.  \"For sheer  audacity commend me to The Stetson Man!  His idea no doubt was to  use you as intermediary in his negotiations with the Museum  authorities, but that plan failing, he has written them direct,  thoughtfully omitting his address, of course!\"    We were, in fact, at that moment bound for the Museum to inspect  this latest piece of evidence.    \"The crowning example of the man's audacity and cleverness,\" added  my companion, \"is his having actually approached Hassan of Aleppo  with a similar proposition!  How did he get in touch with him?  All  Scotland Yard has failed to find any trace of that weird character!\"    \"Birds of a feather--\" I suggested.    \"But they are not birds of a feather!\" cried Bristol.  \"On your own  showing, Hassan of Aleppo is simply waiting his opportunity to  balance Dexter's account forever!  I always knew Dexter was a clever  man; I begin to think he's the most daring genius alive!\"    We mounted the steps of the Museum.  In the hallway Mostyn, the  curator, awaited us.  Having greeted Bristol and myself he led the  way to his private office, and from a pigeon-hole in his desk took  out a letter typewritten upon a sheet of quarto paper.    Bristol spread it out upon the blotting pad and we bent over it  curiously.    SIR--    I believe I can supply information concerning the whereabouts of  the missing slipper of Mohammed.  As any inquiry of this nature  must be extremely perilous to the inquirer and as the relic is a  priceless one, my fee would be 10,000 pounds.  The fanatics who  seek to restore the slipper to the East must not know of any  negotiations, therefore I omit my address, but will communicate  further if you care to insert instructions in the agony column  of Times.                                                     Faithfully,                                                   EARL DEXTER      Bristol laughed grimly.    \"It's a daring game,\" he said; \"a piece of barefaced impudence quite  characteristic.    \"He's posing as a sort of private detective now, and is prepared for  a trifling consideration to return the slipper which he stole  himself!  He must know, though, that we have his severed hand at  the Yard to be used in evidence against him.\"    \"Is the Burton Room open to the public again?\" I asked Mostyn.    \"It is open, yes,\" he replied, \"and a quite unusual number of  visitors come daily to gaze at the empty case which once held the  slipper of the Prophet.\"    \"Has the case been mended?\"    \"Yes; it is quite intact again; only the exhibit is missing.\"    We ascended the stairs, passed along the Assyrian Room, which seemed  to be unusually crowded, and entered the lofty apartment known as  the Burton Room.  The sunblinds were drawn, and a sort of dim,  religious light prevailed therein.  A group of visitors stood around  an empty case at the farther end of the apartment.    \"You see,\" said Mostyn, pointing, \"that empty case has a greater  attraction than all the other full ones!\"    But I scarcely heeded his words, for I was intently watching the  movements of one of the group about the empty case.  I have said  that the room was but dimly illuminated, and this fact, together  no doubt with some effect of reflected light, enhanced by my  imagination, perhaps produced the phenomenon which was occasioning  me so much amazement.    Remember that my mind was filled with memories of weird things,  that I often found myself thinking of that mystic light which  Hassan of Aleppo had called the light of El-Medineh--that light  whereby, undeterred by distance, he claimed to be able to trace the  whereabouts of any of the relics of the Prophet.    Bristol and Mostyn walked on then; but I stood just within the  doorway, intently, breathlessly watching an old man wearing an  out-of-date Inverness coat and a soft felt hat.  He had a gray  beard and moustache, and long, untidy hair, walked with a stoop,  and in short was no unusual type of Visitor to that institution.    But it seemed to me, and the closer I watched him the more  convinced I became, that this was no optical illusion, that a faint  luminosity, a sort of elfin light, played eerily about his head!    As Bristol and Mostyn approached the case the old man began to walk  toward me and in the direction of the door.  The idea flashed  through my mind that it might be Hassan of Aleppo himself, Hassan  who had predicted that the stolen slipper should that day be  returned to the Museum!    Then he came abreast of me, passed me, and I felt that my  surmise had been wrong.  I saw Bristol, from farther up the room,  turn and look back.  Something attracted his trained eye, I suppose,  which was not perceptible to me.  But he suddenly came striding  along.  Obviously he was pursuing the old man, who was just about  to leave the apartment.  Seeing that the latter had reached the  doorway, Bristol began to run.    The old man turned; and amid a chorus of exclamations from the  astonished spectators, Bristol sprang upon him!    How it all came about I cannot say, cannot hope to describe; but  there was a short, sharp scuffle, the crack of a well-directed  blow ... and Bristol was rolling on his back, the old man,  hatless, was racing up the Assyrian Room, and everyone in the place  seemed to be shouting at once!    Bristol, with blood streaming from his face, staggered to his feet,  clutching at me for support.    \"After him, Mr. Cavanagh!\" he cried hoarsely.  \"It's your turn  to-day!  After him!  That's Earl Dexter!\"    Mostyn waited for no more, but went running quickly through the  Assyrian Room.  I may mention here that at the head of the stairs  he found the caped Inverness which had served to conceal Dexter's  mutilated arm, and later, behind a piece of statuary, a wig and  a very ingenious false beard and moustache were discovered.  But  of The Stetson Man there was no trace.  His brief start had enabled  him to make good his escape.    As Mostyn went off, and a group of visitors flocked in our  direction, Bristol, who had been badly shaken by the blow, turned  to them.    \"You will please all leave the Burton Room immediately,\" he said.    Looks of surprise greeted his words; but with his handkerchief  raised to his face, he peremptorily repeated them.  The official  note in his voice was readily to be detected; and the wonder-stricken  group departed with many a backward glance.    As the last left the Burton Room, Bristol pointed, with a rather  shaky finger, at the soft felt hat which lay at his feet.  It had  formed part of Dexter's disguise.  Close beside it lay another  object which had evidently fallen from the hat--a dull red thing  lying on the polished parquet flooring.    \"For God's sake don't go near it!\" whispered Bristol.  \"The room  must be closed for the present.  And now I'm off after that man.  Step clear of it.\"    His words were unnecessary; I shunned it as a leprous thing.    It was the slipper of the Prophet!          CHAPTER XXIII    THE THREE MESSAGES      I stood in the foyer of the Astoria Hotel.  About me was the pulsing  stir of transatlantic life, for the tourist season was now at its  height, and I counted myself fortunate in that I had been able to  secure a room at this establishment, always so popular with American  visitors.  Chatting groups surrounded me and I became acquainted  with numberless projects for visiting the Tower of London, the  National Gallery, the British Museum, Windsor Castle, Kew Gardens,  and the other sights dear to the heart of our visiting cousins.  Loaded lifts ascended and descended.  Bradshaws were in great  evidence everywhere; all was hustle and glad animation.    The tall military-look"]]]
