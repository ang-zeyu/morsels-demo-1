Among  these was JACOPO ROBUSTI (1512-1594), who was called, and is best known as  Tintoretto, which name was given him because his father was a dyer. He  studied under Titian for a time, and then he attempted to follow Michael  Angelo, and it is said that his motto was, \"The coloring of Titian, the  drawing of Michael Angelo.\" His best pictures are slightly treated, and  others are coarse and unfinished in the manner of painting. His portraits  seem to be his best works, probably because they are more carefully  finished.    Several works of his are simply enormous; one is seventy-four by thirty  feet; the school of St. Roch has fifty-seven large pictures by him, in  many of which the figures are of life size. His two most famous works are  the \"Miracle of St. Mark,\" in the Academy of Venice, and the  \"Crucifixion,\" in the school of St. Roch. The last is, for every reason,  his best work; there are crowds of people in it, on foot and on horseback,  while their faces show every possible kind of expression, and their  movements are infinitely varied. The immense painting mentioned above is  in the Doge's Palace, and is called \"Paradise.\" His daughter, MARIETTA  ROBUSTI (1560-1590), was a pupil of her father's, and became so good a  portrait-painter that she was invited to the Court of Spain by Philip II.,  but her father could not consent to a separation from her. Some excellent  pictures of hers still exist, and her portraits of Marco dei Vescovi and  the antiquarian Strada were celebrated pictures. When the Emperor  Maximilian and the Archduke Ferdinand, each in turn, desired her presence  at their courts, her father hastened to marry her to Mario Augusti, a  wealthy German jeweller, upon the condition that she should remain in her  father's house. She was celebrated for her beauty, had fine musical  talents, and was sprightly and enthusiastic; her father was so fond of  having her with him that he sometimes allowed her to dress as a boy, and  go with him to study where young girls were not admitted.    When but thirty years old Marietta Robusti died; she was buried in the  Church of Santa Maria dell Orto, where are several works by her father.  Both he and her husband mourned for her all their remaining days. Many  pictures of Tintoretto painting his daughter's portrait after her death  have been made by later artists.    PAOLI CAGLIARI, or CALIARI, called PAUL VERONESE (1528-1588), was born at  Verona, but as he lived mostly at Venice, he belongs to the school of that  city. He was an imitator of Titian, whom he did not equal; still he was a  fine painter. His excellences were in his harmonious color, his good  arrangement of his figures in the foreground, and his fine architectural  backgrounds. He tried to make his works magnificent, and to do this he  painted festive scenes, with many figures in splendid costumes. He is  buried in the Church of St. Sebastian, where there are many of his works.    In the gallery of the Louvre is his \"Marriage at Cana.\" It is thirty by  twenty feet in size, and many of its figures are portraits. His pictures  are numerous and are seen in the European galleries. The \"Family of  Darius,\" in the National Gallery, London, cost that institution the  enormous sum of thirteen thousand six hundred and fifty pounds; it was  formerly in the Pisani Palace, Venice, and was said to have been left  there by Veronese as payment for his entertainment during a visit he had  made in the palace. In 1868, at the Demidoff sale, a portrait of his  daughter sold for two thousand five hundred and twenty-four pounds.    At the close of the sixteenth century a family of a father and four sons  were busy painting what may rightfully be termed the earliest _genre_  pictures of Italy. This term is used to denote pictures that stand  between historical and utterly imaginary subjects; that is to say, the  representation of something that seems real to us because it is so  familiar to our imagination, or because it is something that we know might  have happened, that it has all the naturalness of an actual reproduction  of a fact. There may be interior or landscape _genre_ pictures. The first  represent familiar in-door scenes--the latter are landscapes with animals  or figures to give a life element and to tell a story.    The name of the family of which I speak was Da Ponte, but it was called  Bassano, from the birth-place of JACOPO DA PONTE BASSANO (1510-1592), the  father, who was the most important of the family. He studied in Venice,  but returned to his native town. His portraits are fine; among them are  those of the Doge of Venice, Ariosto, and Tasso. His works are very  numerous and are seen in all galleries. He introduced landscapes and  animals into most of his pictures, sometimes with great impropriety.    We come now to ANTONIO ALLEGRI, called CORREGGIO (1493-1534), who was born  at the end of the fifteenth, but did his work in the beginning of the  sixteenth century. His name of Correggio is that of his birth-place, and  as he was not born at any of the great art centres, and did not adopt the  precise manner of any school, he, with his followers, stand by themselves,  and yet, because his principal works were done at Parma, he is sometimes  said to be of the school of Parma.    When Correggio was thirteen years old he had learned to draw well. He  studied under Andrea Mantegna and his son Francesco Mantegna. From these  masters he learned to be very skilful in drawing, especially in  foreshortening, or in representing objects seen aslant. But though he  learned much of the science of art from his teachers, his grace and  movement and his exquisite light and shade are all his own, for they did  not possess these qualities.    [Illustration: FIG. 47.--PORTRAIT OF CORREGGIO.]    Foreshortening is so important that I must try to explain it; and, as  Correggio is said to be the greatest master in this art since the days of  the Greeks, it is quite proper for me to speak of it in connection with  him. The art of foreshortening is that which makes different objects  painted on a plane or flat surface appear as if they were at different  distances from the eye of the person who is looking at the picture, or as  scenes in nature appear, where one part is much farther off than another.  To produce this effect it is often necessary to make an object--let us  say, for example, an arm or a leg, look as if it was stretched forward,  out of the canvas, directly toward the person who is looking at it. Now,  the truth is that in order to produce this effect the object is often  thrown backward in the drawing; sometimes also it is doubled up in an  unnatural manner, and occupies a small space on the canvas, while it  appears to be of life size when one looks at it. A \"Christ in Glory\"  painted by Correggio in the cupola of the Church of San Giovanni  Evangelista, in Parma, is a fine piece of foreshortening. The head is so  thrown back, and the knees are so thrown forward, that the whole figure  seems to be of life size; yet if the space from the top of the head to the  soles of the feet were measured, it would be found to be much less than  the height of the same figure would be if it were drawn in an erect  position.    I have already explained the meaning of chiaro-scuro, and this delicate  manner of passing from light to shade was another quality in the works of  Correggio. It is even seen in his early works, as, for instance, in the  beautiful Madonna di San Francesco, now at Dresden, which he painted when  he was but eighteen years old.    When this master was twenty-six years old he married Girolama Nurlini, and  about the same time he was summoned to Mantua by the Duke Federigo  Gonzaga. During eleven years after his marriage he was occupied with works  in Mantua, and with his great frescoes at Parma. In 1530 he returned to  Correggio, and there passed the remainder of his life. That he held a high  position is proved by certain records of his life, among which is the fact  that in 1533 he was invited to be one of the witnesses of the marriage of  the Lord of Correggio.    It is said that when this painter saw one of the great works of Raphael,  he exclaimed, enthusiastically and thankfully, \"I, too, am a painter!\" and  no doubt he then felt himself moved to attempt such works as should make  his name known to all the world through future centuries. When Titian saw  Correggio's frescoes at Parma, he said: \"Were I not Titian, I should wish  to be Correggio.\" Annibale Caracci, also a great artist, said of  Correggio, more than a hundred years after his death, \"He was the only  painter!\" and declared that the children he painted seemed to breathe and  smile with such grace that one was forced to smile and be happy with them.    In 1534 Correggio died of a fever, and was buried in his family tomb in  the Franciscan Convent of his native city. His grave is simply marked with  his name and the date of his death.    Some of his oil-paintings are very famous. One at Dresden, representing  the \"Nativity of the Saviour,\" is called the \"Notte,\" or night, because  the only light on the picture comes from the halo of glory around the head  of the Holy Child. Correggio's \"Reading Magdalen\" is in the same gallery;  probably no one picture exists which has been more universally admired  than this.    [Illustration: FIG. 48.--UPPER PART OF A FRESCO BY CORREGGIO.]    There was a large work of his representing \"The Shepherds Adoring the  Infant Saviour,\" at Seville, in Spain. During the Peninsular War (1808-14)  the people of that city sent many valuable things to Cadiz for safety, and  this picture, on account of its size, was cut in two. By some accident  the two parts were separated; but both were sold, and the purchaser of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24728"],[0,"Stories Of Georgia (#19)"],[1,"to show the state  of feeling in Georgia at that time. After the Yazoo Fraud was passed,  the people of the counties held indignation meetings. A meeting was  called in Oglethorpe County, and on the morning of the day, a citizen on  his way to town stopped at the gate of a neighbor to wait until he could  get ready to go. The man who was getting ready was named Miles Jennings.  The citizen, waiting, saw Mr. Jennings put a rope in his pocket.    \"What is that for?\" the citizen asked.    \"To hang Musgrove!\" replied Mr. Jennings, Musgrove being the name of the  member of the Legislature.    When the two neighbors arrived at the courthouse, all the people had  assembled. Mr. Jennings hitched his horse and went into the crowd,  pulled the rope from his pocket, and, holding it above his head where  all could see it, cried out,--    \"Neighbors! this rope is to hang Musgrove, who sold the people's land  for a bribe!\"    [Illustration: Rope to hang Musgrove 138]    The words of Jennings and the sight of the rope made the people furious.  Musgrove had been given a hint by Jennings's neighbor, and he had made  good his escape. But for that, no human power could have saved him.    The whole State was in a condition of excitement that is hard to  describe. Grand juries made presentments, county and town meetings  passed resolutions, and petitions were sent from hand to hand, and  signed by hundreds of people. A State convention, called to alter the  constitution, had been chosen to meet in May, 1795, but the members had  been chosen at the same time that the members of the corrupt Legislature  had been elected; and a majority of them had been \"tarred with the same  stick,\" as the saying goes. The presentments, resolutions, and petitions  crowded so fast upon the convention, that it was decided to postpone the  changing of the constitution to a time when the people were in a better  humor. The convention referred all the papers it had received to the  next Legislature, and adjourned in some confusion.    This added to the excitement and anger of the people. They were in doubt  how to act. Delay would give the land grabbers time to sell the lands  they had secured through bribery and corruption. But whom could the  people trust? They had been betrayed by many of their highest judges,  by one of their United States senators, and by a large majority of their  Legislature. A great many believed that all the powers of government had  come to an end.    During the troubled times of the Revolution it had been the custom of  military officers having the confidence of the people to convene the  Legislative Assembly when an emergency seemed to call for it. In the  midst of their doubt and confusion, the people applied to General  Twiggs, the senior major general, to convene the Legislature in order  that action might be taken before the swindlers sold the lands they had  obtained by fraud; but General Twiggs refused to act in a case in which  he had no clear right and power, so the people remained for the time  being without a remedy.    From the very beginning of this scheme to defraud the people of the  State, it had been bitterly opposed by General James Jackson, who was  representing Georgia in the United States Senate. He denounced it in the  Senate. He corresponded with the most eminent men in the State, he wrote  to the newspapers, and in every possible way held up to the scorn and  contempt of the public the men who were trying to defraud the State of  its rich Western lands. On the other hand, the conspirators left nothing  undone to injure the reputation of General Jackson. His character was  attacked, and his life was several times threatened. As early as the  spring of 1795, he took occasion in full Senate, and in the presence  of General James Gunn (the Georgia senator who was representing the  swindlers), to denounce the scheme as \"a speculation of the darkest  character and of deliberate villany.\"    By his bold, even violent opposition to the Yazoo sale, General Jackson  had made himself the leader of the people. Therefore in 1795, while he  was still senator, many of the people requested him to resign, so that  he might use his influence and great talents in bringing about the  repeal of the obnoxious law. He tendered his resignation at once, and  returned home. He was elected a member of the Legislature, and devoted  all his time and all his energy to blotting out the odious law. He  became a member of the committee appointed to investigate the means used  to pass the law, and under his leadership the whole scandalous affair  was probed to the bottom.    In electing the new Legislature, the only issue was Yazoo and  anti-Yazoo. The people were successful in electing men who favored  the repeal of the law. There was no other business before the General  Assembly until this matter was disposed of. The body was flooded with  the petitions and remonstrances that had been sent to the convention.  The Legislature had met in January, 1795. At once a day was set to  \"consider the state of the Republic.\" On that day the petitions and  presentments were considered, and referred to a committee, of which  General Jackson was appointed chairman. On the 22d of January the  committee reported not only that the act was unconstitutional, but that  fraud had been practiced to secure its passage. On these grounds they  declared that the act was a nullity, and not binding on the people of  the State.    The bill declaring the sale void was drawn up by General Jackson. It  passed both Houses by large majorities, and was signed by Governor  Irwin. The feeling of the Legislature was so strong, that, after the  Yazoo act had been repealed, it was decided to destroy all the records  and documents relating to the corruption. By order of the two Houses a  fire was kindled in the public square of Louisville, which was then the  capital. The enrolled act that had been secured by fraud was brought out  by the secretary of state, and by him delivered to the President of the  Senate for examination. That officer delivered the act to the Speaker  of the House. The Speaker in turn passed it to the clerk, who read the  title of the act and the other records, and then, committing them to the  flames, cried out in a loud voice, \"God save the State and preserve her  rights, and may every attempt to injure them perish as these wicked and  corrupt acts now do!\"    The flames in which the records were burned were kindled by means of  a sun glass, so that it might be truly said that fire came down from  heaven to destroy the evidences of corruption. There is a tradition that  when the officers of the State had met to destroy the records, an old  man, a stranger to all present, rode through the multitude, and made  his way to where the officials stood. Lifting up his voice, he declared,  that, feeble as he was, he had come there to see an act of justice  performed, but he thought the fire in which the records of corruption  were to be destroyed should come from heaven. The people watched him in  silence. He drew from his bosom with trembling hands a sun glass, and in  this way burned the papers. Then, says tradition, the white-haired old  man mounted his horse and rode away, and was never seen again.          GEORGE MATTHEWS AND JOHN CLARKE.    [Illustration: George Matthews and John Clarke 143]    In giving the history of the Yazoo Fraud, mention has been made of  General George Matthews, who was governor at the time, and who was  compelled to leave the State because he had been persuaded to sign the  bill. General Matthews was one of the most remarkable characters of his  time. Governor Gilmer has drawn a very interesting portrait of him.  It is not a pleasing picture in some respects, but it gives a very  interesting glimpse of a man who in his day was one of the strongest  characters in the State.    He was the son of an Irishman named John Matthews, who settled in  western Virginia in 1737. George Matthews began to fight the Indians at  an age when most boys are at school. In 1761 the Indians attacked and  murdered a family not far from his father's home. He heard the guns, and  thought that a shooting match was going on. With some companions of his  own age, he rode forward to join in the sport; but the youngsters saw  the dead bodies of their neighbors lying in the yard where they had been  left by the murderous savages, and at once turned their horses' heads  and fled. They were not a moment too soon; for the Indians, who had  been lying in ambush, rose and fired at the boys. Matthews had a narrow  escape; for a bullet cut off the wisp of hair (known as a queue) that  hung dangling from the back of his head. The danger that he had passed  through, and the sight of his murdered neighbors, roused young Matthews  to action. He collected a party of men, put himself at the head of them,  followed and overtook the savages, and killed nine of their number.    In the greatest battle that ever took place between the Virginians and  the Indians, Matthews commanded a company, and bore a very conspicuous  part. The battle took place at the junction of the Ohio River with the  Kanawha, on what was called Point Pleasant. The fight began at sunrise,  and was kept up all day, with no great success on either side. The  Indians held their ground, and refused to give way before the most  stubborn attacks of the Virginians. Near sundown, Matthews, with two  other captains, made a strategic movement. The three companies were  withdrawn from the battle. Out of sight of the enemy, they got into the  bed of a creek. Hidden by the banks of the stream, they marched to the  rear of the Indians, and from this point made an attack. The movement  had been so cleverly carried out, that the savages were taken completely  by surprise, and driven across the Ohio.    Early in the Revolutionary War, General Washington, who knew well the  value of the training Matthews had"]]]
