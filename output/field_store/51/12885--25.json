There by his  valour and talent he had rapidly acquired both wealth and position. But  during the twenty-first year an event occurred which gave him a distaste  for the land of his adoption, and he had come back to his native country  with the idea of settling down, far away from old memories and new  entanglements.    In a duel which he had fought in India with a young man named Brown--a  brave youth of no position, who had offended Mannering by his attentions  to his daughter, and by establishing himself in his house as a friend of  the family--he had left Brown for dead on the field, hardly escaping  himself with his life from a sudden attack of the armed banditti who, in  the India of that day, were always hovering round desert places. The  shock of that morning had so told on the health of Mannering's wife that  she died shortly afterwards, leaving him with one daughter, Julia--a  proud, sprightly, sentimental girl, whom he had brought home, and placed  under the care of a friend named Mervyn, whose house stood upon one of  the Cumberland lakes.    So it came about that when Mannering was in Scotland, he received a  letter from his friend which took him to Mervyn Hall as fast as  horse-flesh could carry him.    His friend wrote, as he was careful to say, without his wife's  knowledge. Mr. Mervyn told Colonel Mannering that he was certain that  his daughter Julia was receiving secret visits from some one whom she  did not dare to see openly. Not only were there long solitary walks and  hill-climbings, but on several occasions he had heard up the lake at  midnight, as if under her windows, a flageolet playing a little Indian  air to which Julia Mannering was partial. This was evidently a signal,  for a boat had been seen hastily crossing the lake, and the sash of  Julia's window had been heard to shut down at the first alarm. Mr.  Mervyn said that, little as he liked playing the part of tale-bearer, he  felt that Julia was under his care, and he would not deserve his old  name of Downright Dunstable if he did not inform her father of what he  had discovered. Julia, he said, was both a charming and high spirited  girl, but she was too much her own father's daughter to be without  romantic ideas. On the whole, concluded Mr. Mervyn, it behooved the  Colonel to come at once to Mervyn Hall and look after his own property.    This was the letter which, put into his hands at a seaport town in  Scotland, lost Mannering the estate of Ellangowan, and threw the ancient  seat of many generations of Bertrams into the clutches of the  scoundrelly Glossin. For Colonel Mannering instantly posted off to the  south, having first of all sent despatches to Mr. Mac-Morlan by the  untrustworthy postilion--the same who arrived a day too late for the  sale.    When Colonel Mannering first went to Mervyn Hall, he could make nothing  of the case. Of course he believed Brown to have died by his hand in  India, and he could find no traces of any other man likely to be making  love to his daughter. Nevertheless he had brought back a plan with him  from Scotland, which, he thought, would put an end to all future  difficulties. The helplessness of Lucy Bertram had moved his heart.  Besides, he was more amused than he cared to own by the originality of  the Dominie. He had easily obtained, by means of Mr. Mac-Morlan, a  furnished house in the neighbourhood of Ellangowan, and he resolved for  a time at least to repose himself there after his campaigns. His  daughter Julia would thus have a companion in Lucy Bertram, and it was  easy to provide the Dominie with an occupation. For the library of an  uncle of Mannering's, who had been a learned bishop of the Church of  England, had been willed to him. The Dominie was the very man to put the  books in order. So indeed it was arranged, after some saucy remarks from  Miss Mannering as to the supposed Scottish accent and probable red hair  of her companion.    Then Colonel Mannering, accustomed to do nothing by halves, sent down  his directions about Dominie Sampson, whose heart indeed would have been  broken if he had been separated from the young mistress over whom he had  watched from childhood.    \"Let the poor man be properly dressed,\" wrote the Colonel to Mr.  Mac-Morlan, \"and let him accompany his young lady to Woodbourne!\"    The dressing of Dominie Sampson was, however, easier said than done. For  it would hurt the pride of the Dominie to have clothes presented to him  as to a schoolboy. But Lucy Bertram soon settled the matter. The  Dominie, she said, would never notice the difference, if they put one  garment at a time into his sleeping room and took away the other. This  was what her father had always done when the wardrobe of his dependent  needed renewing. Nor had the Dominie ever showed the least consciousness  of the change.    So said, so done. A good tailor, having come and looked Mr. Sampson  over, readily agreed to provide him with two excellent suits, one black  and one raven grey, such as would fit the Dominie as well as a man of  such an out-of-the-way build could be fitted by merely human needles and  shears.    The Dominie, when completely equipped, made no remark upon the  change--further than that, in his opinion, the air of a seaport town  like Kippletringan seemed to be favourable to wearing-apparel.    It was the depth of winter when the Mannerings arrived at Woodbourne.  All were a little anxious. Even Dominie Sampson longed to be at his  books, and going repeatedly to the windows demanded, \"Why tarry the  wheels of their chariot?\" But when at last they came, Lucy and Julia  Bertram were soon friends, while the Dominie stood with uplifted hands,  exclaiming, \"Prodeegious! Prodeegious!\" as, one after another, the  thirty or forty cart-loads of books were deposited on the library floor  ready to his hand. His arms flapped like windmills, and the uncouth  scholar counted himself the happiest man on earth as he began to  arrange the great volumes on the shelves. Not that he got on very  quickly. For he wrote out the catalogue in his best running-hand. He put  the books on the shelves as carefully as if they had been old and  precious china. Yet in spite of the Dominie's zeal, his labours advanced  but slowly. Often he would chance to open a volume when halfway up the  ladder. Then, his eye falling upon some entrancing passage, he would  stand there transfixed, oblivious of the flight of time, till a  serving-maid pulled his skirts to tell him dinner was waiting. He would  then bolt his food in three-inch squares, and rush back to the library,  often with his dinner napkin still tied round his neck like a pinafore.  Thus, for the first time in his life, Dominie Sampson was perfectly  content.    [Illustration: \"HIS eye falling upon some entrancing passage, he would  stand there transfixed, oblivious of the flight of time, till a  serving-maid pulled his skirts to tell him dinner was waiting.\"]      II. DANDIE DINMONT    But the story now turns to the young man Brown, or, to give him his full  title, Captain Vanbeest Brown, whom Colonel Mannering had left for dead  on an Indian field. He did not die, but he had been compelled to  undergo a long captivity among the bandits before he found his way back  to his regiment. The new Colonel whom he found in Mannering's place had  been kind to him, and he soon found himself in command of a troop of  dragoons. He was at present on leave in England, and, as he was  conscious that Mannering had no reason for his ill-will and apparent  cruelty, Brown felt that he on his part had no reason for standing on  ceremony with such a man. He loved Julia Mannering, and, to say the  least of it, she did not discourage him. So it was he who had played the  Hindoo air upon the lake--he with whom Julia had talked at her window,  even as Mervyn had related in his letter to his friend Colonel  Mannering.    When the Colonel and his daughter went away to Scotland, Captain Brown,  having no relatives in the country, resolved to follow them. He set out  on foot, having for sole companion a little terrier named Wasp. On the  way he had to pass a long and weary waste of heath and morass. One house  alone broke the monotonous expanse. It was little better than a shed,  but was sheltered by an ash tree, and a clay-built shed alongside served  for a rude stable. A stout pony stood tethered in front of the door,  busy with a feed of oats. Stillness brooded all around. It was a poor  place, but Captain Brown had wandered too far and seen too much to care  about appearances. He stooped his head and entered at the low door. In  a few minutes he found himself attacking a round of beef and washing it  down with home-brewed ale in company with the owner of the pony tethered  outside, a certain Mr. Dandie Dinmont, a store-farmer on his way home  from a Cumberland fair. At first only pleasant nods passed between them  as they drank to each other in silence.    Presently Brown noticed, seated in the great chimney, a very tall old  woman clad in a red cloak and a slouched bonnet, having all the  appearance of a gipsy or tinker. She smoked silently at her clay pipe,  while the doubtful-looking landlady went about her affairs.    Brown's terrier Wasp was the means of his striking up an acquaintance  with the sturdy farmer opposite, who, hearing that he had never seen a  blackcock, invited him forthwith to Charlies-hope, the name of his farm,  where he promised him he should both see blackcock, shoot blackcock, and  eat blackcock. Dandie Dinmont was going on to tell Brown of his  wanderings, when the old crone in the red cloak by the side of the fire  suddenly broke silence by asking if he had been recently in Galloway,  and if he knew Ellangowan.    \"Ellangowan!\" cried the farmer, \"I ken it weel!
