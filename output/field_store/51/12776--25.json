The  Company had taken care that there should be \"plentiful provision  of godly ministers.\" Three approved clergymen of the Church of  England--Higginson, Skelton, and Bright--had been chosen by the Company  to attend the expedition, besides whom one Ralph Smith, a Separatist  minister, had been permitted to take passage before the Company  \"understood of his difference in judgment in some things\" from the other  ministers. He was permitted to continue his journey, yet not without a  caution to the governor that unless he were found \"conformable to the  government\" he was not to be suffered to remain within the limits of its  jurisdiction. An incident of this departure rests on the sole authority  of Cotton Mather, and is best told in his own words:         \"When they came to the Land's End, Mr. Higginson, calling up       his children and other passengers unto the stern of the ship       to take their last sight of England, said, 'We will not say,       as the Separatists were wont to say at their leaving of       England, Farewell, Babylon! farewell, Rome! but we will say,       Farewell, dear England! farewell, the church of God in       England, and all the Christian friends there! We do not go to       New England as Separatists from the Church of England, though       we cannot but separate from the corruptions in it; but we go       to practice the positive part of church reformation and       propagate the gospel in America.'\"    The story ought to be true, for the intrinsic likeliness of it; and it  is all the likelier for the fact that among the passengers, kindly and  even fraternally treated, and yet the object of grave misgivings, was  the honest Separatist minister, Ralph Smith.[91:1] The ideal of the new  colony could hardly have been better expressed than in these possibly  apocryphal words ascribed to Mr. Higginson. These were not fugitives  seeking asylum from persecution. Still less were they planning an asylum  for others. They were intent on the planting of a new commonwealth, in  which the church of Christ, not according to the imperfect and perverted  pattern of the English Establishment, but according to a fairer pattern,  that had been showed them in their mounts of vision, should be both free  and dominant. If this purpose of theirs was wrong; if they had no right  to deny themselves the comforts and delights of their native land, and  at vast cost of treasure to seclude themselves within a defined tract of  wilderness, for the accomplishment of an enterprise which they conceived  to be of the highest beneficence to mankind--then doubtless many of the  measures which they took in pursuance of this purpose must fall under  the same condemnation with the purpose itself. If there are minds so  constituted as to perceive no moral difference between banishing a man  from his native home, for opinion's sake, and declining, on account of  difference of opinion, to admit a man to partnership in a difficult and  hazardous enterprise organized on a distinctly exclusive basis, such  minds will be constrained to condemn the Puritan colonists from the  start and all along. Minds otherwise constituted will be able to  discriminate between the righteous following of a justifiable policy and  the lapses of the colonial governments from high and Christian motives  and righteous courses. Whether the policy of rigorous exclusiveness,  building up communities of picked material, homogeneous in race,  language, and religion, is on the whole less wise for the founders of a  new commonwealth than a sweepingly comprehensive policy, gathering in  people mutually alien in speech and creed and habits, is a fairly open  question for historical students. Much light might be thrown upon it by  the comparative history of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, of New  England and Pennsylvania. It is not a question that is answered at once  by the mere statement of it.    We do not need to be told that to the little Separatist settlement at  Plymouth, still in the first decade of its feeble existence, the  founding, within a day's journey, of this powerful colony, on  ecclesiastical principles distinctly antagonistic to their own, was a  momentous, even a formidable fact. Critical, nay, vital questions  emerged at once, which the subtlest churchcraft might have despaired of  answering. They were answered, solved, harmonized, by the spirit of  Christian love.    That great spiritual teacher, John Robinson, besides his more general  exhortations to brotherly kindness and charity, had spoken, in the  spirit of prophecy, some promises and assurances which came now to a  divine fulfillment. Pondering \"sundry weighty and solid reasons\" in  favor of removal from Holland, the pilgrims put on record that \"their  pastor would often say that many of those who both wrote and preached  against them would practice as they did if they were in a place where  they might have liberty and live conformably.\" One of the most  affectionate of his disciples, Edward Winslow, wrote down some of the  precious and memorable words which the pastor, who was to see their face  no more, uttered through his tears as they were about to leave him.  \"'There will be no difference,' he said, 'between the unconformable  ministers and you, when they come to the practice of the ordinances out  of the kingdom.' And so he advised us to close with the godly party of  the kingdom of England, and rather to study union than division, viz.,  how near we might possibly without sin close with them, rather than in  the least measure to affect division or separation from them.\"    The solitude of the little starving hamlet by the sea was favorable to  the springing and fructifying of this seed in the good and honest hearts  into which it had been cast. Before the great fleet of colonists, with  its three unconformable Church of England clergymen, had reached the  port of Salem the good seed had been planted anew in other hearts not  less honest and good. It fell on this wise. The pioneer party at Salem  who came with Endicott, \"arriving there in an uncultivated desert, many  of them, for want of wholesome diet and convenient lodgings, were seized  with the scurvy and other distempers, which shortened many of their  days, and prevented many of the rest from performing any great matter of  labor that year for advancing the work of the plantation.\" Whereupon the  governor, hearing that at Plymouth lived a physician \"that had some  skill that way,\" wrote thither for help, and at once the beloved  physician and deacon of the Plymouth church, Dr. Samuel Fuller,  hastened to their relief. On what themes the discourse revolved between  the Puritan governor just from England and the Separatist deacon already  for so many years an exile, and whither it tended, is manifested in a  letter written soon after by Governor Endicott, of Salem, to Governor  Bradford, of Plymouth, under date May 11 (= 21), 1629. The letter marks  an epoch in the history of American Christianity:         \"_To the worshipful and my right worthy friend, William       Bradford, Esq., Governor of New Plymouth, these:_         \"RIGHT WORTHY SIR: It is a thing not usual that servants to       one Master and of the same household should be strangers. I       assure you I desire it not; nay, to speak more plainly, I       cannot be so to you. God's people are marked with one and the       same mark, and sealed with one and the same seal, and have,       for the main, one and the same heart, guided by one and the       same Spirit of truth; and where this is there can be no       discord--nay, here must needs be sweet harmony. The same       request with you I make unto the Lord, that we may as       Christian brethren be united by a heavenly and unfeigned love,       bending all our hearts and forces in furthering a work beyond       our strength, with reverence and fear fastening our eyes       always on him that only is able to direct and prosper all our       ways.         \"I acknowledge myself much bound to you for your kind love and       care in sending Mr. Fuller among us, and I rejoice much that I       am by him satisfied touching your judgments of the outward       form of God's worship.[94:1] It is, as far as I can yet       gather, no other than is warranted by the evidence of truth,       and the same which I have professed and maintained ever since       the Lord in mercy revealed himself to me, being very far       different from the common report that hath been spread of you       touching that particular. But God's children must not look for       less here below, and it is the great mercy of God that he       strengthens them to go through with it.         \"I shall not need at this time to be tedious unto you, for,       God willing, I purpose to see your face shortly. In the       meantime I humbly take my leave of you, committing you to the       Lord's blessed protection, and rest         \"Your assured loving friend and servant,         \"JOHN ENDICOTT.\"    \"The positive part of church reformation,\" which Higginson and his  companions had come into the wilderness to practice, appeared in a new  light when studied under the new conditions. The question of separation  from the general fellowship of English Christians, which had lain  heavily on their consciences, was no longer a question; instead of it  arose the question of separation from their beloved and honored  fellow-Christians at Plymouth. The Act of Uniformity and the tyrannous  processes by which it was enforced no longer existed for them.

The appeal was supported by three of the Consuls.    The Committee, which you have appointed to examine the situation in  the prisoners' camps, where Boer women are concentrated, though they  could not always obtain the required accurate information, have gained  sufficient results to arrive at the conclusions as laid down in short  in the following report:--    I.--In order to formulate a clear idea of the situation the Committee  has laid down the following tables:        (a) Showing the population and deaths in the Camps during April          1901, compiled from the official reports of the          Inspector-General of the Camps.        (b) The death-rate in the Camps of the Transvaal calculated from          Table A, as well as from reports published in the Official          Gazette, and according to other trustworthy information.        (c) The death-rate in the Camps at Bloemfontein and Kroonstad,          compiled from the notices in the Official Gazette of the          Orange Free State.        (d) Diseases and deaths according to Official Gazette.    II.--Although the returns are not complete through absence of returns  for whole weeks in the official publications, we may arrive at the  following conclusions:        1. That the death-percentage in the Camps surpasses all          hitherto-known proportions.        2. That the death-rate amounts to 14 times that of Pretoria,          which has, according to Dr. Stroud, an average of 25 per          thousand per year.        3. That the death-rate among the children confined to the Camps          has increased to an alarming extent.    The Committee, basing their verdict partly on the repeated assertions  of public opinion, on the communications of eye-witnesses, on the  evidence given by certain witnesses in a case before the Military  Court at Pretoria, and finally on the personal observations of four  members of the Consular Corps, to whom permission was granted to visit  the Camp at Irene, feel compelled to believe the principal causes of  diseases, carrying in their train such an abnormal death-rate, to be:        1. The difficulties and misery and privations to which the Boer         families are subject after having been driven from their         farms (their journeys often lasting about 20 days).        2. The insufficient quantity and frequently even bad quality of         articles of food distributed among them. Often the food given         to the children is in every respect inadequate to their         wants.        3. The great fall in temperature during the night.        4. The insufficient protection against cold experienced in the         tents by the healthy population, and all the more by the         invalids.        5. The absence of clothing and blankets.        6. The insufficient providing for invalids and the inadequate         state of medical stores.        7. The want of employees for the sanitary service in the Camps.    In view of the importance of the problem put before the Committee,  they have drawn up the above report and have sent copies of same to  all the members of the Consular Corps.
