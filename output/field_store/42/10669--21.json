Conscious of his integrity, his  heart was cheered, and he anticipated an immediate restitution of all  his rights and dignities.    He appeared in Grenada, not as a disgraced man, but richly dressed, and  attended by a noble retinue.  He was received with unqualified favour  and distinction, and as he beheld tears in the benign eyes of Isabella,  he threw himself on his knees, and for some time could not utter a word  for the violence of his tears and sobbing.  Enabled to speak, he  defended himself fully; indeed, the imputations of his enemies had been  his best advocate.    Meantime the Pinzons and several other explorers had sailed forth,  chiefly in search of pearls and gold.    While we feel indignant at the treatment received by Columbus, we must  not forget the miseries of the helpless natives his discoveries had  brought within the power of so-called civilised Europeans.    The excellent Las Casas gives a vivid and faithful picture of the  tyranny exercised over the Indians by worthless Spaniards; wretches who  in their own country had been the vilest of the vile, but had in the New  World assumed the tone of grand cavaliers.  Over much of their conduct  it is necessary to draw the veil.  Their very pleasures were attended  with cruelty.  At the least freak of ill humour they inflicted blows,  and lashes, and even death itself, on their helpless slaves.    Such were some of the evils which had sprung up under the rule of  Bobadilla.  The wrongs of the natives reaching the benevolent heart of  Isabella, she urged that a new governor, Don Nicolas de Ovando, should  be sent out to supersede him, to inquire into the conduct of Columbus.  Ovando shortly afterwards sailed in command of one of the largest fleets  that had yet proceeded to the New World.    We should always bear in mind the lofty enthusiastic aspirations which  influenced the mind of the great navigator.  He had hoped by the wealth  he should obtain to win the Holy Sepulchre from the infidels, but more  practical schemes soon occupied him.  The wealth brought from the East,  owing to the discoveries of the Portuguese, aroused him to emulation.  He had found a strong current setting westward, through the Caribbean  Sea, between the coasts of Paria on the south and Cuba on the north, the  latter, as he believed, being a part of the Asiatic continent stretching  onwards in the same direction.  He believed therefore that there must be  a straight opening into the Indian Sea, and, could he discover it, he  believed that he should be able to reach India by a far more easy route  than any yet followed.    His plan was listened to with attention by the sovereigns, and he was  authorised to fit out another armament.    He asked permission to touch at Hispaniola for supplies on the outward  voyage, but the sovereigns, knowing that he had many enemies in the  island, forbade him doing so.  They, however, to soothe his feelings,  wrote him a letter dated the 14th of March, 1502, solemnly assuring him  that all his dignities should be enjoyed by him and his sons after him,  and that they would bestow further honours and rewards upon him and them  as well as upon his excellent brothers.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    FOURTH AND LAST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS--A.D. 1502.

Columbus had reached the age of sixty-eight years when he embarked upon  his fourth voyage.  His squadron consisted of four caravels, the  smallest of fifty tons burden, the largest not exceeding seventy; the  crews amounted, in all, to one hundred and fifty men.  He had with him  his faithful and intrepid brother, Don Bartholomew, and his younger son,  Fernando.  The squadron sailed from Cadiz on the 9th of May, A.D. 1502,  and after touching at Ercilla, on the coast of Morocco, stood away for  the Canaries, where it arrived on the 25th of May, on the evening of  which day he took his departure for the New World.  Without shifting a  sail it reached Martinico.    Though prohibited from touching at Hispaniola, one of his vessels was so  bad a sea boat that he ventured to steer for San Domingo, in order to  change her for another.    Arriving off the river on the 29th of June, he found a fleet with  Bobadilla on board, as well as a large amount of treasure and several  unhappy Indian captives.    The agent of Columbus had shipped four thousand pieces of gold, recently  collected or recovered from Bobadilla, on board one of the caravels.    Columbus immediately sent to ask permission of Ovando, who had assumed  the government, to enter the harbour, stating that the weather looked  threatening, and that he believed a hurricane was brewing.    Ovando most ungraciously refused the boon asked for by Columbus, who  then again sent on shore, entreating that, although shelter was denied  to him, the fleet about to sail might be detained in harbour until the  coming tempest had spent its fury.    This request was also refused, the Governor and his officers not  believing the warning.  Columbus, therefore, steered along the coast,  keeping as close to the shore as possible, convinced that the storm  would blow from the north.  The crews at once began to complain, having  lost their reliance on one who was subjected to such ill treatment.    Within two days his predictions were verified.  A fearful hurricane  burst upon them, during which the ship carrying Bobadilla and an  unfortunate cacique foundered, together with an enormous mass of gold,--  the principal part of the treasure gained by the miseries of the  Indians.  Many other ships were lost, some returning to San Domingo  sorely battered, while only one, the weakest of the fleet, with the  treasure of the Admiral on board, continued her voyage to Spain.    The squadron of Columbus, though having suffered much, safely reached  the port of Hermoso, at the west end of San Domingo.  Here he remained  several days, and then, after touching at some small islands off Jamaica  swept by the current, he reached a group near the coast of Honduras, one  of which he called the Isla de Pinos, now known as Guanaja, or Bonacca.    The Adelantado, on landing on its beautiful and fertile shore, saw an  immense canoe approaching, eight feet wide, and of great length, though  formed of the trunk of a single tree.  Under a canopy of palm-leaves sat  a cacique, with his wives and children, rowed by twenty-five Indians.    The canoe was filled with all kinds of articles of manufacture and  natural production.  The Indians, without fear, came alongside the  Admiral's caravel.  He was delighted to obtain, without trouble,  specimens of so many important articles of this part of the New World.  Among them were hatchets formed of copper, wooden swords with channels  on each side of the blade, in which sharp flints were firmly fixed by  cords formed of the intestines of fishes, such as were afterwards found  among the Mexicans.  There were bells and other articles of copper, and  clay utensils; cotton shirts worked, and dyed with various colours;  great quantities of cacao, a fruit as yet unknown to the Spaniards, and  a beverage resembling beer, extracted from Indian corn.  Their  provisions consisted of maize bread, and roots of various kinds.  Many  of the articles they willingly exchanged for European trinkets.  The  women were wrapped in mantles like the female Moors of Grenada, and the  men had cloths of cotton round their loins.  From their being clothed,  and from the superiority of their manufactures, the Admiral believed  that he was approaching more civilised nations.    The natives stated that they had just arrived from a rich cultivated  country, with the wealth and magnificence of which they endeavoured to  impress him.  His mind, however, being bent on the discovery of the  strait, and believing that he could easily visit them at some future  period, he determined to seek the mainland, and keep steadily on until  he reached the opening between it and Paria.    Had he followed the advice of his visitors he might have discovered  Mexico, and even the Southern Ocean might have been disclosed to him.  He was encouraged to persist in the course he had designed by hearing  from an old man, whom he had detained as pilot, that there were many  places farther on abounding in gold.    Reaching the mainland on Sunday, the 14th of August, he and his  officers, and many of the men, landed, and Mass was performed under the  trees.  On the 17th the Adelantado went ashore near the mouth of a  river, and took possession of the country in the name of their Catholic  Majesties.  At"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#17)"],[1,"nobly resolved to offer their lives in exchange for  those that had been taken.    They therefore set out for Persia, and, having obtained permission to  enter the palace, appeared before the king. Here the courtiers bade them  fall down before the monarch, and do homage to him, as they saw the  others do. But the proud young men refused to do so, saying that such  honor could be shown only to their gods, and that it was not the custom  of their country to humble themselves thus. Xerxes, to the surprise of  his courtiers did not at all resent their refusal to fall down before  him, but kindly bade them make their errand known.    Thus invited to speak, one of them replied, \"King of Persia, some years  ago our people killed two of your father's messengers. It was wrong to  touch an ambassador, we know. You are about to visit our country to seek  revenge for this crime. Desist, O king! for we have come hither, my  friend and I, to offer our lives in exchange for those our people have  taken. Here we are! Do with us as you will.\"    Xerxes was filled with admiration when he heard this speech, and saw the  handsome youths standing quietly before him, ready to die to atone for  their country's wrong. Instead of accepting their offer, he loaded them  with rich gifts, and sent them home unharmed, telling them he would not  injure the innocent, for he was more just than the Lac-e-dae-mo'ni-ans.    But a few months later, when his preparations were complete, Xerxes set  out with an army which is said to have numbered more than two million  fighting men. As they were attended by slaves and servants of all kinds,  some of the old historians say that ten millions of human beings were  included in this mighty host.          XLVIII. THE GREAT ARMY.      Xerxes' army marched in various sections across Asia Minor, and all the  forces came together at the Hellespont. Here the king had ordered the  building of two great bridges,--one for the troops, and the other for  the immense train of baggage which followed him.    These bridges were no sooner finished than a rising storm entirely  destroyed them. When Xerxes heard of the disaster, he not only condemned  the unlucky engineers to death, but also had the waves flogged with  whips, and ordered chains flung across the strait, to show that he  considered the sea an unruly slave, who should be taught to obey his  master.    Then, undaunted by his misfortune, the King of Persia gave orders for  the building of new bridges; and when they were finished, he reviewed  his army from the top of a neighboring mountain.    The sight must have been grand indeed, and the courtiers standing around  were greatly surprised when they saw their master suddenly burst into  tears. When asked the cause of his sorrow, Xerxes answered, \"See that  mighty host spread out as far as eye can reach! I weep at the thought  that a hundred years hence there will be nothing left of it except,  perhaps, a handful of dust and a few moldering bones!\"    The king was soon comforted, however, and crossed the bridge first,  attended by his bodyguard of picked soldiers, who were called the  Immortals because they had never suffered defeat. All the army followed  him, and during seven days and nights the bridge resounded with the  steady tramp of the armed host; but, even when the rear guard had passed  over the Hellespont, there were still so many slaves and baggage wagons,  that it took them a whole month to file past.    That was a procession such as has never again been seen. You can imagine  what a sight it was for all the boys and girls who lived near enough to  the Hellespont to see this mighty parade, which continued night and day.    They saw not only the sacred chariot drawn by eight white horses, the  glittering array of the Immortals, the burnished helmets and arms of the  foot soldiers, and the silken canopies and tents over the grandees, but  also countless chariots drawn by four horses, and provided on either  side with sharp scythes, which were intended to mow down the enemy like  ripe grain.    [Illustration: Crossing the Hellespont.]    Besides these strange mowing machines, there were many other engines of  war, which were all made to strike terror into the hearts of the Greeks,  and to subdue completely the proud people who had so sorely defeated  Darius' troops at Marathon.    To prevent his fleet from being wrecked as his father's was, Xerxes had  given orders to dig a great canal across the isthmus that connected  Mount Athos with the mainland; and through this the vessels sailed past  the promontory in safety.          XLIX. PREPARATIONS FOR DEFENSE.      The news of Xerxes' crossing of the Hellespont, and of his approach to  conquer Greece, soon reached Athens, where it filled all hearts with  fear. The people then remembered Miltiades, and bitterly regretted his  death, and their ingratitude, which had been its real cause.    As the mighty general who had already once delivered them was dead, they  tried to think who could best replace him, and decided to recall  Aristides the Just from his undeserved exile. Aristides generously  forgave his fellow-citizens for all the harm they had done him, and he  and Themistocles began to do all in their power to insure the safety of  Athens.    Swift runners were dispatched in every direction with messages urging  all the Greek cities to unite for the good of the country by sending as  many brave men as possible to check the Persian army, and to try to  hinder it from really entering Greece.    Themistocles was the most active in this attempt to induce the Greek  cities to join forces, and it was he who planned a great council, or  meeting, at Corinth, in 481 B.C. There it soon became evident that the  cities were too jealous of each other to unite as they should.    Many of them promised help, which they never sent; others vowed they  would neither send troops nor furnish aid of any kind, unless _their_  generals had supreme command; and even the oracles gave vague and  discouraging answers, when consulted as usual.    In spite of all these drawbacks, Themistocles managed to get a few  allies; and, in order to induce the Spartans to lend their aid, he  promised them the command not only of the army, but also of the fleet.    He next persuaded them that it would be wisest to send an armed force  into Thessaly, so as to defend the narrow pass of Thermopylae, which was  the only road by which the Persians could enter Greece. This natural  causeway, as we have seen, lay between the mountains and the sea; and,  because there were springs of warm water here, it was generally known as  Thermopylae, which is the Greek for \"Hot Gateway.\"    Under the guidance of Le-on'i-das, one of the Spartan kings, three  hundred Lacedaemonian soldiers and six thousand allies marched thither,  and undertook to guard the pass. This was a very small army; but it was  impossible to get more soldiers at the time, as all the Greeks were more  anxious to attend the Olympic games, which were just then being  celebrated, than to defend their country and homes.    Many of them said they were afraid the gods would be angry if they did  not keep the feast as usual, and declared that it was against the law to  bear arms or make war during that time. This was perfectly true; but  Xerxes did not care at all for the Greek gods, and the country would  have been defenseless had it not been for Leonidas and his handful of  men.    While this little army traveled northwards, the rest of the people  thronged to Olympia, promising to come and fight as soon as the games  were ended, and they could again bear arms without offending the gods.    The Persian fleet, as you have seen, had passed behind Mount Athos,  instead of rounding it as before, and Xerxes intended landing part of  his army just below Thermopylae. Unfortunately for him, however, the four  hundred vessels bearing his troops were wrecked by a sudden storm.    Another fleet was immediately prepared; but, before it was ready, the  Olympic games came to an end, and the Greeks, flying to arms as they had  promised, hastily embarked upon their own vessels, and came and took up  their position at Ar-te-mis'ium, to hinder the advance of the Persian  fleet.    [Illustration]          L. LEONIDAS AT THERMOPYLAE      The Persian army had come to the Pass of Thermopylae; and Xerxes, seeing  that it was guarded by only a few men, sent them a haughty message,  bidding them surrender their arms.    Instead of seeing a meek compliance with this request, as they expected,  the Persian heralds were amazed to hear Leonidas reply with true laconic  brevity, \"Come and take them!\"    The Spartan king, however, had quickly seen that it would be impossible  for him to do much more than stop for a while the advance of this mighty  host. As a Spartan never drew back, he made up his mind to die on the  field of battle, and bade his warriors comb their hair, don their  choicest armor, and dress themselves in their richest attire, as was the  custom when some great danger threatened them and they expected to die.    The Persians, seeing this, were greatly surprised, and advanced  confidently, for they fancied that men who took so much trouble to curl  and perfume their hair would not be hard to conquer. They soon found out  their mistake.    As they advanced, the archers shot a volley of arrows, and in such  numbers that they fairly darkened the sun. One of the allies, seeing  this, ran to warn Leonidas; but he received the startling news with  great coolness, and merely said, \"Very well; then we can fight in the  shade.\"    When Xerxes saw that the Greeks would not yield without striking a blow,  he gave orders for the battle to begin. The Persians pressed forward,  under the eye of their king, who sat high up on the rocks to see them  conquer; but, to his surprise, they were driven back by that mere  handful of men.    Again and again they tried to force"]]]
