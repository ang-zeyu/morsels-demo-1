She has  holidays--a whole fortnight--and nothing to do but enjoy them.\"    \"Holidays are dismal things when you've nowhere to holiday,\" said Ida  mournfully. \"The time drags horribly. But never mind, girls, I've a  plummy bit of news for you. I'd a letter from Mother today and, bless  the dear woman, she is sending me a cake--a New Year's cake--a great  big, spicy, mellow, delicious fruit cake. It will be along tomorrow  and, girls, we'll celebrate when it comes. I've asked everybody in the  house up to my room for New Year's Eve, and we'll have a royal good  time.\"    \"How splendid!\" said Mary. \"There's nothing I like more than a slice  of real countrified home-made fruit cake, where they don't scrimp on  eggs or butter or raisins. You'll give me a good big piece, won't you,  Ida?\"    \"As much as you can eat,\" promised Ida. \"I can warrant Mother's fruit  cake. Yes, we'll have a jamboree. Miss Monroe has promised to come in  too. She says she has a weakness for fruit cake.\"    \"Oh!\" breathed all the girls. Miss Monroe was their idol, whom they  had to be content to worship at a distance as a general thing. She was  a clever journalist, who worked on a paper, and was reputed to be  writing a book. The girls felt they were highly privileged to be  boarding in the same house, and counted that day lost on which they  did not receive a businesslike nod or an absent-minded smile from Miss  Monroe. If she ever had time to speak to one of them about the  weather, that fortunate one put on airs for a week. And now to think  that she had actually promised to drop into Ida's room on New Year's  Eve and eat fruit cake!    \"There goes that funny little namesake of yours, Ida,\" said Josie, who  was sitting by the window. \"She seems to be staying in town over the  holidays too. Wonder why. Perhaps she doesn't belong anywhere. She  really is a most forlorn-appearing little mortal.\"    There were two Ida Mitchells attending the Clifton Academy. The other  Ida was a plain, quiet, pale-faced little girl of fifteen who was in  the second year. Beyond that, none of the third-year Ida Mitchell's  set knew anything about her, or tried to find out.    \"She must be very poor,\" said Ida carelessly. \"She dresses so  shabbily, and she always looks so pinched and subdued. She boards in a  little house out on Marlboro Road, and I pity her if she has to spend  her holidays there, for a more dismal place I never saw. I was there  once on the trail of a book I had lost. Going, girls? Well, don't  forget tomorrow night.\"    Ida spent the next day decorating her room and watching for the  arrival of her cake. It hadn't come by tea-time, and she concluded to  go down to the express office and investigate. It would be dreadful if  that cake didn't turn up in time, with all the girls and Miss Monroe  coming in. Ida felt that she would be mortified to death.    Inquiry at the express office discovered two things. A box had come in  for Miss Ida Mitchell, Clifton; and said box had been delivered to  Miss Ida Mitchell, Clifton.    \"One of our clerks said he knew you personally--boarded next door to  you--and he'd take it round himself,\" the manager informed her.    \"There must be some mistake,\" said Ida in perplexity. \"I don't know  any of the clerks here. Oh--why--there's another Ida Mitchell in town!  Can it be possible my cake has gone to her?\"    The manager thought it very possible, and offered to send around and  see. But Ida said it was on her way home and she would call herself.    At the dismal little house on Marlboro Road she was sent up three  flights of stairs to the other Ida Mitchell's small hall bedroom. The  other Ida Mitchell opened the door for her. Behind her, on the table,  was the cake--such a fine, big, brown cake, with raisins sticking out  all over it!    \"Why, how do you do, Miss Mitchell!\" exclaimed the other Ida with shy  pleasure. \"Come in. I didn't know you were in town. It's real good of  you to come and see me. And just see what I've had sent to me! Isn't  it a beauty? I was so surprised when it came--and, oh, so glad! I was  feeling so blue and lonesome--as if I hadn't a friend in the world.  I--I--yes, I was crying when that cake came. It has just made the  world over for me. Do sit down and I'll cut you a piece. I'm sure  you're as fond of fruit cake as I am.\"    Ida sat down in a chair, feeling bewildered and awkward. This was a  nice predicament! How could she tell that other Ida that the cake  didn't belong to her? The poor thing was so delighted. And, oh, what a  bare, lonely little room! The big, luxurious cake seemed to emphasize  the bareness and loneliness.    \"Who--who sent it to you?\" she asked lamely.    \"It must have been Mrs. Henderson, because there is nobody else who  would,\" answered the other Ida. \"Two years ago I was going to school  in Trenton and I boarded with her. When I left her to come to Clifton  she told me she would send me a cake for Christmas. Well, I expected  that cake last year--and it didn't come. I can't tell you how  disappointed I was. You'll think me very childish. But I was so  lonely, with no home to go to like the other girls. But she sent it  this year, you see. It is so nice to think that somebody has  remembered me at New Year's. It isn't the cake itself--it's the  thought behind it. It has just made all the difference in the world.  There--just sample it, Miss Mitchell.\"    The other Ida cut a generous slice from the cake and passed it to her  guest. Her eyes were shining and her cheeks were flushed. She was  really a very sweet-looking little thing--not a bit like her usual  pale, timid self.    Ida ate the cake slowly. What was she to do? She couldn't tell the  other Ida the truth about the cake. But the girls she had asked in to  help eat it that very evening! And Miss Monroe! Oh, dear, it was too  bad. But it couldn't be helped. She wouldn't blot out that light on  the other Ida's face for anything! Of course, she would find out the  truth in time--probably after she had written to thank Mrs. Henderson  for the cake; but meanwhile she would have enjoyed the cake, and the  supposed kindness back of it would tide her over her New Year  loneliness.    \"It's delicious,\" said Ida heartily, swallowing her own disappointment  with the cake. \"I'm--I'm glad I happened to drop in as I was passing.\"  Ida hoped that speech didn't come under the head of a fib.    \"So am I,\" said the other Ida brightly. \"Oh, I've been so lonesome and  downhearted this week. I'm so alone, you see--there isn't anybody to  care. Father died three years ago, and I don't remember my mother at  all. There is nobody but myself, and it is dreadfully lonely at times.  When the Academy is open and I have my lessons to study, I don't mind  so much. But the holidays take all the courage out of me.\"    \"We should have fraternized more this week,\" smiled Ida, regretting  that she hadn't thought of it before. \"I couldn't go home because of  the measles, and I've moped a lot. We might have spent the time  together and had a real nice, jolly holiday.\"    The other Ida blushed with delight.    \"I'd love to be friends with you,\" she said slowly. \"I've often  thought I'd like to know you. Isn't it odd that we have the same name?  It was so nice of you to come and see me. I--I'd love to have you come  often.\"    \"I will,\" said Ida heartily.    \"Perhaps you will stay the evening,\" suggested the other Ida. \"I've  asked some of the girls who board here in to have some cake, I'm so  glad to be able to give them something--they've all been so good to  me. They are all clerks in stores and some of them are so tired and  lonely. It's so nice to have a pleasure to share with them. Won't you  stay?\"    \"I'd like to,\" laughed Ida, \"but I have some guests of my own invited  in for tonight. I must hurry home, for they will most surely be  waiting for me.\"    She laughed again as she thought what else the guests would be waiting  for. But her face was sober enough as she walked home.    \"But I'm glad I left the cake with her,\" she said resolutely. \"Poor  little thing! It means so much to her. It meant only 'a good feed,' as  Josie says, to me. I'm simply going to make it my business next term  to be good friends with the other Ida Mitchell. I'm afraid we  third-year girls are very self-centred and selfish. And I know what  I'll do! I'll write to Abby Morton in Trenton to send me Mrs.  Henderson's address, and I'll write her a letter and ask her not to  let Ida know she didn't send the cake.\"    Ida went into a confectionery store and invested in what Josie Pye was  wont to call \"ready-to-wear eatables\"--fancy cakes, fruit, and  candies. When she reached her room she found it full of expectant  girls, with Miss Monroe enthroned in the midst of them--Miss Monroe  in a wonderful evening dress of black lace and yellow silk, with roses  in her hair and pearls on her neck--all donned in honour of Ida's  little celebration. I won't say that, just for a moment, Ida didn't  regret that she had given up her cake.    \"Good evening, Miss Mitchell,\" cried Mary Craig gaily. \"Walk right in  and make yourself at home in your own room, do! We all met in the  hall, and knocked and knocked. Finally Miss Monroe came, so we made  bold to walk right in. Where is the only and original fruit cake, Ida?  My mouth has been watering all day.\"    \"The other Ida Mitchell is probably entertaining her friends at this  moment with my fruit cake,\" said Ida, with a little laugh.    Then she told the whole story.    \"I'm so sorry to disappoint you,\" she concluded, \"but I simply  couldn't tell that poor, lonely child that the cake wasn't intended  for her. I've brought all the goodies home with me that I could buy,  and we'll have to do the best we can without the fruit cake.\"    Their \"best\" proved to be a very good thing. They had a jolly New  Year's Eve, and Miss Monroe sparkled and entertained most brilliantly.

There was  a story that the Captain had been a smuggler and that if he was caught  he'd be sent to prison. Oh, there were all sorts of yarns, mostly  coming from the men who worked there, for nobody else ever got inside  the house. Well, four years ago his wife disappeared--it wasn't known  how or when. She just wasn't ever seen again, that's all. Whether she  died or was murdered or went away nobody ever knew. There was some  talk of an investigation but nothing came of it. As for the girl,  she's always lived there with her father. She must be a perfect  heathen. He never goes anywhere, but there used to be talk of  strangers visiting him--queer sort of characters who came up the lake  in vessels from the American side. I haven't heard any reports of such  these past few years, though--not since his wife disappeared. He keeps  a yacht and goes sailing in it--sometimes he cruises about for  weeks--that's about all he ever does. And now you know as much about  the Olivers as I do, Mr. Douglas.\"    Alan had listened to this gossipy narrative with an interest that did  not escape Isabel King's observant eyes. Much of it he mentally  dismissed as improbable surmise, but the basic facts were probably as  Mrs. Danby had reported them. He had known that the girl of the shore  could be no commonplace, primly nurtured young woman.    \"Has no effort ever been made to bring these people into touch with  the church?\" he asked absently.    \"Bless you, yes. Every minister that's ever been in Rexton has had a  try at it. The old cousin met every one of them at the door and told  him nobody was at home. Mr. Strong was the most persistent--he didn't  like being beaten. He went again and again and finally the Captain  sent him word that when he wanted parsons or pill-dosers he'd send  for them, and till he did he'd thank them to mind their own business.  They say Mr. Strong met Lynde once along shore and wanted to know if  she wouldn't come to church, and she laughed in his face and told him  she knew more about God now than he did or ever would. Perhaps the  story isn't true. Or if it was maybe he provoked her into saying it.  Mr. Strong wasn't overly tactful. I believe in judging the poor girl  as charitably as possible and making allowances for her, seeing how  she's been brought up. You couldn't expect her to know how to behave.\"    Somehow, Alan resented Mrs. Danby's charity. Then, his sense of humour  being strongly developed, he smiled to think of this commonplace old  lady \"making allowances\" for the splendid bit of femininity he had  seen on the shore. A plump barnyard fowl might as well have talked of  making allowances for a seagull!    Alan walked home with Isabel King but he was very silent as they went  together down the long, dark, sweet-smelling country road bordered by  its white orchards. Isabel put her own construction on his absent  replies to her remarks and presently she asked him, \"Did you think  Lynde Oliver handsome?\"    The question gave Alan an annoyance out of all proportion to its  significance. He felt an instinctive reluctance to discuss Lynde  Oliver with Isabel King.    \"I saw her only for a moment,\" he said coldly, \"but she impressed me  as being a beautiful woman.\"    \"They tell queer stories about her--but maybe they're not all true,\"  said Isabel, unable to keep the sneer of malice out of her voice. At  that moment Alan's secret contempt for her crystallized into  pronounced aversion. He made no reply and they went the rest of the  way in silence. At her gate Isabel said, \"You haven't been over to see  us very lately, Mr. Douglas.\"    \"My congregation is a large one and I cannot visit all my people as  often as I might wish,\" Alan answered, all the more coldly for the  personal note in her tone. \"A minister's time is not his own, you  know.\"    \"Shall you be going to see the Olivers?\" asked Isabel bluntly.    \"I have not considered that question. Good-night, Miss King.\"    On his way back to the manse Alan did consider the question. Should he  make any attempt to establish friendly relations with the residents of  Four Winds? It surprised him to find how much he wanted to, but he  finally concluded that he would not. They were not adherents of his  church and he did not believe that even a minister had any right to  force himself upon people who plainly wished to be let alone.    When he got home, although it was late, he went to his study and began  work on a new text--for Elder Trewin's seemed utterly out of the  question. Even with the new one he did not get on very well. At last  in exasperation he leaned back in his chair.    Why can't I stop thinking of those Four Winds people? Here, let me put  these haunting thoughts into words and see if that will lay them. That  girl had a beautiful face but a cold one. Would I like to see it  lighted up with the warmth of her soul set free? Yes, frankly, I would.  She looked upon me with indifference. Would I like to see her welcome  me as a friend? I have a conviction that I would, although no doubt  everybody in my congregation would look upon her as a most unsuitable  friend for me. Do I believe that she is wild, unwomanly, heathenish, as  Mrs. Danby says? No, I do not, most emphatically. I believe she is a  lady in the truest sense of that much abused word, though she is  doubtless unconventional. Having said all this, I do not see what more  there is to be said. And--I--am--going--to--write--this--sermon.    Alan wrote it, putting all thought of Lynde Oliver sternly out of his  mind for the time being. He had no notion of falling in love with her.  He knew nothing of love and imagined that it counted for nothing in  his life. He admitted that his curiosity was aflame about the girl,  but it never occurred to him that she meant or could mean anything to  him but an attractive enigma which once solved would lose its  attraction. The young women he knew in Rexton, whose simple, pleasant  friendship he valued, had the placid, domestic charm of their own  sweet-breathed, windless orchards. Lynde Oliver had the fascination of  the lake shore--wild, remote, untamed--the lure of the wilderness and  the primitive. There was nothing more personal in his thought of her,  and yet when he recalled Isabel King's sneer he felt an almost  personal resentment.           *       *       *       *       *    During the following fortnight Alan made many trips to the shore--and  he always went by the branch road to the Four Winds point. He did not  attempt to conceal from himself that he hoped to meet Lynde Oliver  again. In this he was unsuccessful. Sometimes he saw her at a distance  along the shore but she always disappeared as soon as seen.  Occasionally as he crossed the point he saw her working in her garden  but he never went very near the house, feeling that he had no right to  spy on it or her in any way. He soon became convinced that she avoided  him purposely and the conviction piqued him. He felt an odd masterful  desire to meet her face to face and make her look at him. Sometimes he  called himself a fool and vowed he would go no more to the Four Winds  shore. Yet he inevitably went. He did not find in the shore the  comfort and inspiration he had formerly found. Something had come  between his soul and the soul of the wilderness--something he did not  recognize or formulate--a nameless, haunting longing that shaped  itself about the memory of a cold sweet face and starry, indifferent  eyes, grey as the lake at dawn.    Of Captain Anthony he never got even a glimpse, but he saw the old  cousin several times, going and coming about the yard and its  environs. Finally one day he met her, coming up a path which led to a  spring down in a firry hollow. She was carrying two heavy pails of  water and Alan asked permission to help her.    He half expected a repulse, for the tall, grim old woman had a rather  stern and forbidding look, but after gazing at him a moment in a  somewhat scrutinizing manner she said briefly, \"You may, if you like.\"    Alan took the pails and followed her, the path not being wide enough  for two. She strode on before him at a rapid, vigorous pace until they  came out into the yard by the house. Alan felt his heart beating  foolishly. Would he see Lynde Oliver? Would--    \"You may carry the water there,\" the old woman said, pointing to a  little outhouse near the pines. \"I'm washing--the spring water is  softer than the well water. Thank you\"--as Alan set the pails down on  a bench--\"I'm not so young as I was and bringing the water so far  tires me. Lynde always brings it for me when she's home.\"    She stood before him in the narrow doorway, blocking his exit, and  looked at him with keen, deep-set dark eyes. In spite of her withered  aspect and wrinkled face, she was not an uncomely old woman and there  was about her a dignity of carriage and manner that pleased Alan. It  did not occur to him to wonder why it should please him. If he had  hunted that feeling down he might have been surprised to discover that  it had its origin in a curious gratification over the thought that the  woman who lived with Lynde had a certain refinement about her. He  preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity.    \"Are you the young minister up at Rexton?\" she asked bluntly.    \"Yes.\"    \"I thought so. Lynde said she had seen you on the shore once.  Well\"--she cast an uncertain glance over her shoulder at the  house--\"I'm much obliged to you.\"    Alan had an idea that that was not what she had thought of saying, but  as she had turned aside and was busying herself with the pails, there  seemed nothing for him to do but to go.    \"Wait a moment.\" She faced him again, and if Alan had been a vain man  he might have thought that admiration looked from her piercing eyes.  \"What do you think of us? I suppose they've told you tales of us up"]]]
