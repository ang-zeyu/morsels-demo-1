Mr. Tolman sensed the situation in a second.    \"You mean somebody thinks my son took the pocketbook?\" asked he  indignantly, as he confronted the clerk and his companion.    \"It is not my affair, sir, and I am sorry it should happen in our  hotel,\" apologized the clerk. \"Perhaps if you will just explain the  whole matter to this gentleman--\" he broke off, saying in an undertone  to the man at his elbow. \"This is your boy, Donovan.\"    The tall man came nearer.    \"You are a detective?\" asked Mr. Tolman bluntly.    \"Well, something of the sort, sir,\" admitted the man called Donovan. \"It  is occasionally my business to hunt people up.\"    \"And you have been sent to hunt my son up?\"    Donovan nodded.    Stephen turned white and his father put a reassuring hand on his  shoulder.    \"My son and I,\" he replied, addressing the detective quietly, \"can  explain this entire affair to you and will do so gladly. The boy did  find the pocketbook but he was ignorant of its value because he has not  even looked inside it. In fact, that he had the article in his  possession did not come into his mind until a few moments ago. If he had  known the thing was valuable, do you suppose he would have left it in  his ulster pocket and checked the coat in a public place like this?\"    The detective made no reply.    \"We both shall be very glad,\" went on Mr. Tolman firmly, \"to go with you  to headquarters and straighten the matter out.\"    \"There may be no need of that, sir,\" Donovan responded with a pleasant  smile. \"If we can just talk the affair over in a satisfactory way--\"    \"Suppose you come upstairs to our room,\" suggested Mr. Tolman. \"That  will give us more quiet and privacy. Will that be agreeable to you?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    As the three walked toward the elevator Steve glanced with trepidation  at the plain-clothes man.    The boy knew he had done nothing wrong; but would he be able to convince  the detective of the truth of his story? He was thoroughly frightened  and wondered whether his father was also alarmed.    If, however, Mr. Tolman was worried he at least did not show it. Instead  he courteously led the way from the elevator down the dim corridor and  unlocked the door of Number 379.    \"Come in, Mr. Donovan,\" he said cordially. \"Here is a chair and a cigar.  Now, son, tell us the story of this troublesome pocketbook from  beginning to end.\"    In a trembling voice Stephen began his tale. He spoke slowly,  uncertainly, for he was well scared. Gradually, however, he forgot his  agitation and his voice became more positive. He recounted the details  of the omnibus ride with great care, adding ingenuously when he came to  the termination of the narrative:    \"And I hoped the man's name would be inside the pocketbook because I  liked him very much and wanted to return to him what he had lost.\"    \"And wasn't it?\" put in Mr. Donovan quickly.    \"I don't know,\" was the innocent retort. \"Don't you remember I told you  that I hadn't looked inside yet?\"    The detective laughed with satisfaction.    \"That was a shabby trick of mine, youngster,\" said he. \"It was mean to  try to trap you.\"    \"Trap me?\" repeated Steve vaguely.    \"There, there, sonny!\" went on Donovan kindly. \"Don't you worry a minute  more about this mix-up. Mr. Ackerman, the gentleman who lost the bill  book, did not think for a second that you had taken it. He simply was so  sure that he had lost it on the bus that he wanted to locate you and  find out whether you knew anything about it or not. His name was not  inside the pocketbook, you see, and therefore any one who found it would  have no way of tracing its owner. What it contains are valuable papers  and a big wad of Liberty Bonds which, as your father knows, could  quickly be converted into cash. In consequence Mr. Ackerman decided that  the sooner the pocketbook was found the better. The omnibus people  denied any knowledge of it and you were the only remaining clue.\"    Mr. Tolman sank back in his chair and a relaxation of his muscles  betrayed for the first time that he had been much more disturbed than he  had appeared to be.    \"Well,\" he said, lighting a fresh cigar, \"the bill book is not only  located but we can hand it back intact to its owner. If you can inform  us where the gentleman lives, my boy and I will call a taxi and go to  his house or office with his property.\"    A flush of embarrassment suffused the face of the officer.    \"Maybe you would like to come with us, Donovan,\" added Mr. Tolman, who  instantly interpreted the man's confusion.    \"I hate to be dogging your footsteps, sir, in this fashion,\" Mr. Donovan  answered, with obvious sincerity. \"Still, I--\"    \"You have your orders, no doubt.\"    \"Well, yes, sir,\" admitted the plain-clothes man with reluctance. \"I  have.\"    \"You were to keep your eye on us until the pocketbook reached its  owner.\"    \"That's about it, sir. Not that I personally have the least suspicion  that a gentleman like you would--\"    \"That is all right, my man. I perfectly understand your position,\" Mr.  Tolman cut in. \"After all, you have your duty to do and business is  business. We'll just telephone Mr. Ackerman that we are coming so that  we shall be sure of catching him, and then we will go right up there.\"    \"Very well, sir.\"    Stephen's father started toward the telephone and then, as if struck by  a sudden thought, paused and turned.    \"Steve,\" he said, \"I believe you are the person to communicate with Mr.  Ackerman. Call him up and tell him you have found his purse and that you  and your father would like to come up to his house, if it will be  convenient, and return it.\"    \"All right, Dad.\"    \"You will find his number on this slip of paper, sonny,\" the detective  added, handing the lad a card. \"He is not at his office. He went home to  lunch in the hope that he had left the pocketbook there.\"    After some delay Stephen succeeded in getting the number written on the  card. A servant answered the summons.    \"May I speak to Mr. Ackerman, please?\" inquired the lad. \"He is at  luncheon? No, it would not do the least good for me to tell you my name  for he would not know who it was. Just tell him that the boy who sat  beside him this morning on the Fifth Avenue bus--\" there was a little  chuckle. \"Oh, he will be here directly, will he? I thought perhaps he  would.\"    A moment later a cheery voice which Steve at once recognized to be that  of the steamboat man came over the wire:    \"Well, sonny?\"    \"I found your bill book, Mr. Ackerman, and my father and I would like to  bring it up to you.\"    \"Well, well! that is fine news!\" cried the man at the other end of the  line. \"How did you know who it belonged to?\"    \"Oh, I--we--found out--my father and I,\" stammered the lad. \"May we come  up to your house with it now?\"    \"You would much better let me come to you; then only one person will be  inconvenienced,\" the New Yorker returned pleasantly. \"Where are you  staying?\"    \"At the Manhattan.\"    \"You must not think of taking the trouble of coming way up here. Let me  join you and your father at your hotel.\"    \"Very well, Mr. Ackerman. If you'd rather--\"    \"I certainly should rather!\" was the emphatic answer. \"I could not think  of bringing two people so far out of their way.\"    \"There are three of us!\" squeaked Stephen.    \"Three?\"    \"Yes, sir. We have another person--a friend--with us,\" explained the  boy, with quiet enjoyment. How easy it was to laugh now!    \"All the more reason why I should come to you, then,\" asserted Mr.  Ackerman. \"I will be at the Manhattan within half an hour. Perhaps if  you and your father and your friend have the afternoon free you would  like to go to some sort of a show with me after we conclude our  business. Since you are here on a holiday you can't be very busy.\"    Stephen's eyes sparkled with merriment.    \"I don't know whether our friend can go or not,\" he replied politely,  \"but I think perhaps Dad and I could; and if we can we should like to  very much.\"    \"That will be excellent. I will come right along. Not only shall I be  glad to get my pocketbook back again but I shall be glad to see you once  more. I told you this morning that I had a feeling we should meet some  time. Whom shall I ask for at the hotel?\"    \"Stephen Tolman.\"    With a click the boy hung up the receiver.    \"Mr. Ackerman is coming right down,\" said he, addressing his father and  the detective with a mischievous smile. \"He has invited the three of us  to go to the matinee with him.\"    \"The three of us!\" echoed the plain-clothes man.    \"Yes,\" returned the lad. \"I told him we had a friend with us and so he  said to bring him along.\"    \"Good heavens!\" Donovan ejaculated.    Mr. Tolman laughed heartily.    \"Not all the thieves you arrest take you to a theater party afterward,  do they, Officer?\" he asked.    \"I said from the first you were gentlemen,\" Mr. Donovan asserted with  humor.    \"But couldn't you go?\" inquired Steve, quite seriously.    \"Bless you, no, sonny!\" replied the man. \"I am from headquarters, you  know, and my work is chasing up crooks--not going to matinees.\"    Nevertheless there was an intonation of gentleness in his voice, as he  added, \"I am obliged to you just the same, for in spite of my calling I  am a human being and I appreciate being treated like one.\"          CHAPTER IX    AN ASTOUNDING CALAMITY      Mr. Ackerman was as good as his word, for within half an hour he  presented himself at the hotel where he found Mr. Tolman, Mr. Donovan  and Steve awaiting him in their pleasant upstairs room. As he joined  them his eye traveled inquiringly from one to another of the group and  lingered with curiosity on the face of the detective. The next instant  he was holding out his hand to Stephen.    \"Well, my boy, I am glad to see you again,\" said he, a ring of  heartiness in his voice.    \"And I am glad to see you, too, Mr. Ackerman,\" Steve replied, returning  the hand-clasp with fervor. \"This is my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#17)"],[1,"in the cold wind, so that he looked to Owasso--who turned away  from him, leaving the wicked old magician alone to ponder upon his past  life--to Owasso he looked like a tough old sycamore-tree more than a  highly-gifted old magician.    Owasso himself reached home in safety, proof against all kinds of  weather, and the magic canoe became the exclusive property of the young  man and his wife.    During all this part of Owasso's stay at the lodge of Mishosha, his  sister, whom he had left on the main land with Sheem, their younger  brother, had labored with good-will to supply the lodge. She knew enough  of the arts of the forest to provide their daily food, and she watched  her little brother, and tended his wants, with all of a good sister's  care. By times she began to be weary of solitude and of her charge. No  one came to be a witness of her constancy, or to let fall a single word  in her mother-tongue. She could not converse with the birds and beasts  about her, and she felt, to the bottom of her heart, that she was alone.  In these thoughts she forgot her younger brother; she almost wished him  dead; for it was he alone that kept her from seeking the companionship  of others.    One day, after collecting all the provisions she had been able to  reserve from their daily use, and bringing a supply of wood to the door,  she said to her little brother:    \"My brother, you must not stray from the lodge. I am going to seek our  elder brother. I shall be back soon.\"    She then set the lodge in perfect order, and, taking her bundle, she set  off in search of habitations. These she soon found, and in the enjoyment  of the pleasures and pastimes of her new acquaintance, she began to  think less and less of her little brother, Sheem. She accepted proposals  of marriage, and from that time she utterly forgot the abandoned boy.    As for poor little Sheem, he was soon brought to the pinching turn of  his fate. As soon as he had eaten all of the food left in the lodge, he  was obliged to pick berries, and live off of such roots as he could dig  with his slender hands. As he wandered about in search of wherewithal to  stay his hunger, he often looked up to heaven, and saw the gray clouds  going up and down. And then he looked about upon the wide earth, but he  never saw sister nor brother returning from their long delay.    At last, even the roots and berries gave out. They were blighted by the  frost or hidden out of reach by the snow, for the mid-winter had come  on, and poor little Sheem was obliged to leave the lodge and wander away  in search of food.    Sometimes he was enforced to pass the night in the clefts of old trees  or caverns, and to break his fast with the refuse meals of the savage  wolves.    These at last became his only resource, and he grew to be so little  fearful of these animals that he would sit by them while they devoured  their meat, and patiently await his share.    After a while, the wolves took to little Sheem very kindly, and seeming  to understand his outcast condition, they would always leave something  for him to eat. By and by they began to talk with him, and to inquire  into his history. When he told them that he had been forsaken by his  brother and his sister, the wolves turned about to each other, lifted up  their eyes to heaven, and wondered among themselves, with raised paws,  that such a thing should have been.    In this way, Sheem lived on till the spring, and as soon as the lake was  free from ice, he followed his new friends to the shore.    It happened on the same day, that his elder brother, Owasso, was fishing  in his magic canoe, a considerable distance out upon the lake; when he  thought he heard the cries of a child upon the shore. He wondered how  any human creature could exist on so bleak and barren a coast.    He listened again with all attention, and he heard the cry distinctly  repeated; and this time it was the well-known cry of his younger brother  that reached his ear. He knew too well the secret of his song, as he  heard him chaunting mournfully:    \"My brother! My brother! Since you left me going in the canoe, a-hee-ee,  I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf,  E-wee.\"    Owasso made for the shore, and as he approached the lament was repeated.  The sounds were very distinct, and the voice of wailing was very  sorrowful for Owasso to listen to, and it touched him the more that it  died away at the close, into a long-drawn howl, like that of the wolf.    In the sand, as he drew closer to the land, he saw the tracks as of that  animal fleeing away; and besides these the prints of human hands. But  what were the pity and astonishment that smote Owasso to the heart when  he espied his poor little brother--poor little forsaken Sheem--half boy  and half wolf, flying along the shore.    Owasso immediately leaped upon the ground and strove to catch him in his  arms, saying soothingly, \"My brother! my brother! Come to me.\"    But the poor wolf-boy avoided his grasp, crying, as he fled, \"Neesia,  neesia. Since you left me going in the canoe, a-he-ee, I am half changed  into a wolf, E-wee. I am half changed into a wolf, E-wee!\" and howling  between these words of lament.    The elder brother, sore at heart, and feeling all of his brotherly  affection strongly returning, with renewed anguish, cried out, \"My  brother! my brother! my brother!\"    But the nearer he approached to poor Sheem, the faster he fled, and the  more rapidly the change went on; the boy-wolf by turns singing and  howling, and calling out the name, first of his brother and then of his  sister, till the change was complete. He leaped upon a bank, and looking  back, and casting upon Owasso a glance of deep reproach and grief, he  exclaimed, \"I am a wolf!\" and disappeared in the woods.          XII.    THE MAGIC BUNDLE.      A poor man, called Iena, or the Wanderer, was in the habit of roaming  about from place to place, forlorn, without relations, and almost  helpless. He had often wished for a companion to share his solitude; but  who would think of joining their fortunes with those of a poor wanderer,  who had no shelter but such as his leather hunting-shirt provided, and  no other household in the world than the bundle which he carried in his  hand, and in which his hunting-shirt was laid away?    One day as he went on a hunting excursion, to relieve himself of the  burden of carrying it, Iena hung up his bundle on the branch of a tree,  and then set out in quest of game.    On returning to the spot in the evening, he was surprised to find a  small but neat lodge built in the place where he had left his bundle;  and on looking in he beheld a beautiful female, sitting on the further  side of the lodge, with his bundle lying beside her.    During the day Iena had so far prospered in his sport as to kill a deer,  which he now cast down at the lodge door.    Without pausing to take the least notice, or to give a word of welcome  to the hunter, the woman ran out and began to see whether it was a large  deer that he had brought. In her haste she stumbled and fell at the  threshold.    Iena looked at her with astonishment, and thought to himself, \"I  supposed I was blessed, but I find my mistake. Night-Hawk,\" said he,  speaking aloud, \"I will leave my game with you that you may feast on  it.\"    He then took up his bundle and departed. After walking some time he came  to another tree, on which he suspended his bundle as before, and went in  search of game.    Success again attended him, and he returned, bringing with him a deer,  and he found that a lodge had sprung up as before, where he had hung his  bundle. He looked in and saw a beautiful female sitting alone, with his  bundle by her side.    She arose and came out toward the deer which he had deposited at the  door, and he immediately went into the lodge and sat by the fire, as he  was weary with the day's hunt, which had carried him far away.    The woman did not return, and wondering at her delay, Iena at last  arose, and peeping through the door of the lodge, beheld her greedily  eating all the fat of the deer. He exclaimed, \"I thought I was blessed,  but I find I was mistaken.\" Then addressing the woman: \"Poor Marten,\"  said he, \"feast on the game I have brought.\"    He again took up his bundle and departed; and, as usual, hung it upon  the branch of a tree, and wandered off in quest of game.    In the evening he returned, with his customary good luck, bringing in a  fine deer. He again found that a lodge had taken the place of his  bundle. He gazed through an opening in the side of the lodge, and there  was another beautiful woman sitting alone, with a bundle by her side.    As soon as he entered the lodge, she rose cheerfully, welcomed him home,  and without delay or complaining, she brought in the deer, cut it up as  it should be, and hung up the meat to dry. She then prepared a portion  of it for the supper of the weary hunter. The man thought to himself,  \"Now I am certainly blessed.\"    He continued his practice of hunting every day, and the woman, on his  return, always welcomed him, readily took charge of the meat, and  promptly prepared his evening meal; and he ever after lived a contented  and happy man.          XIII.    THE RED SWAN.      Three brothers were left destitute, by the death of their parents, at an  early age. The eldest was not yet able to provide fully for their  support, but he did all that he could in hunting; and with this aid, and  the stock of provisions already laid by in the lodge, they managed to  keep along. They had no neighbors to lend them a helping hand, for the  father had withdrawn many years before from the body of the tribe, and  had lived ever since in a solitary place. The lads had no idea that  there was a human being near them. They did not even know who their  parents had been; for, at the time of their death, the eldest was too  young to remember it.
