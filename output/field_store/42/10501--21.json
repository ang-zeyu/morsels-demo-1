As sorrowing for my son I bow--and yield up my unwilling breath,      So, sorrowing for thy son shalt thou--at life's last close repose in death.'      That curse, dread sounding in mine ear--to mine own city forth I set,      Nor long survived that hermit seer--to mourn his child in lone regret.      This day that Brahmin curse fulfilled--hath fallen on my devoted head,      In anguish for any parted child--have all my sinking spirits fled.      No more my darkened eyes can see--my clouded memory is o'ercast,      Dark Yama's heralds summon me--to his deep, dreary, realm to haste.      Mine eye no more my Rama sees--and grief o'erburns, my spirits sink,      As the swollen stream sweeps down the trees--that grow upon the crumbling          brink.      Oh, felt I Rama's touch, or spake--one word his home-returning voice,      Again to life should I awake--as quaffing nectar draughts rejoice,      But what so sad could e'er have been--celestial partner of my heart,      Than, Rama's beauteous face unseen,--from life untimely to depart.      His exile in the forest o'er--him home returned to Oudes high town,      Oh happy those, that see once more--like Indra from the sky come down.      No mortal men, but gods I deem--moonlike, before whose wondering sight,      My Rama's glorious face shall beam--from the dark forest bursting bright.      Happy that gaze on Rama's face--with beauteous teeth and smile of love,      Like the blue lotus in its grace--and like the starry king above.      Like to the full autumnal moon--and like the lotus in its bloom,      That youth who sees returning soon--how blest shall be that mortal's doom.      Dwelling on that sweet memory--on his last bed the monarch lay,      And slowly, softly, seemed to die--as fades the moon at dawn away.      \"Ah, Rama! ah, my son!\" thus said--or scarcely said, the king of men,      His gentle hapless spirit fled--in sorrow for his Rama then,      The shepherd of his people old--at midnight on his bed of death,      The tale of his son's exile told--and breathed away his dying breath.          EXTRACTS FROM THE MAHABHARATA.    THE BRAHMIN'S LAMENT.          The hostility of the kindred races of Pandu and Kuru forms      one of the great circles of Indian fable. It fills great part      of the immense poem, the Mahabharata. At this period the five      sons of Pandu and their mother Kunti have been driven into      the wilderness from the court of their uncle Dritarashtra at      Nagapur. The brothers, during their residence in the forest,      have an encounter with a terrible giant, Hidimba, the      prototype of the Cyclops of Homer, and of the whole race of      giants of northern origin, who, after amusing our ancestors,      children of larger growth, descended to our nurseries, from      whence they are now well-nigh exploded. After this adventure      the brothers take up their residence in the city of Ekachara,      where they are hospitably received in the house of a Brahmin.      The neighbourhood of this city is haunted by another terrible      giant, Baka, whose cannibal appetite has been glutted by a      succession of meaner victims. It is now come to the Brahmin's      turn to furnish the fatal banquet; they overhear the      following complaint of their host, whose family, consisting      of himself, his wife, a grown up daughter, and a son a little      child, must surrender one to become the horrible repast of      the monster. In turn, the father, the mother, in what may be      fairly called three singularly pathetic Indian elegies,      enforce each their claim to the privilege of suffering for      the rest.          THE BRAHMIN'S LAMENT.          Alas for life, so vain, so weary--in this changing world below,      Ever-teeming root of sorrow--still dependent, full of woe!      Still to life clings strong affliction--life that's one long suffering all,      Whoso lives must bear his sorrow--soon or late that must befall.           *       *       *       *       *        Oh to find a place of refuge--in this dire extremity,      For my wife, my son, my daughter--and myself what hope may be?      Oft I've said to thee, my dearest--Priestess, that thou knowest well,      But my word thou never heededst--let us go where peace may dwell.      \"Here I had my birth, my nurture--still my sire is living here;      Oh unwise!\" 'twas thus thou answeredst--to my oft-repeated prayer.      Thine old father went to heaven--slept thy mother by his side,      Then thy near and dear relations--why delight'st thou here t' abide?      Fondly loving still thy kindred--thine old home thou would'st not leave,      Of thy kindred death deprived thee--in thy griefs I could but grieve.      Now to me is death approaching--never victim will I give,      From mine house, like some base craven--and myself consent to live.      Thee with righteous soul, the gentle--ever like a mother deemed,      A sweet friend the gods have given me--aye my choicest wealth esteem'd.      From thy parents thee, consenting--mistress of my house I took,      Thee I chose, and thee I honoured--as enjoins the holy book.      Thou the high-born, thou the virtuous!--my dear children's mother thou,      Only to prolong my being--thee the good, the blameless, now,      Can to thy death surrender--mine own true, my faithful wife?        Yet my son can I abandon--in his early bloom of life,      Offer him in his sweet childhood--with no down his cheek to shade?        Her, whom Brahma, the all-bounteous--for a lovely bride hath made,      Mother of a race of heroes--a heaven-winning race may make;[153]      Of myself begot, the virgin--could I ever her forsake?      Towards a son the hearts of fathers--some have thought, are deepest moved,      Others deem the daughter dearer--both alike I've ever loved:      She that sons, that heaven hath in her--sons whose offerings heaven may win,      Can I render up my daughter--blameless, undefiled by sin?      If myself I offer, sorrow--in the next world my lot must be,      Hardly then could live my children--and my wife bereft of me.      One of these so dear to offer--to the wise, were sin, were shame,      Yet without me they must perish--how to 'scape the sin, the blame!      Woe! Oh woe! where find I refuge--for myself, for mine, oh where!      Better 'twere to die together--for to live I cannot bear.        _The_ BRAHMIN'S WIFE _speaks_.        As of lowly caste, my husband--yield not thus thy soul to woe,      This is not a time for wailing--who the Vedas knows must know:      Fate inevitable orders--all must yield to death in turn,      Hence the doom, th' irrevocable--it beseems not thee to mourn.      Man hath wife, and son, and daughter--for the joy of his own heart.      Wherefore wisely check thy sorrow--it is I must hence depart.      Tis the wife's most holy duty--law on earth without repeal,      That her life she offer freely--when demands her husband's weal.      And e'en now, a deed so noble--hath its meed of pride and bliss,      In the next world life eternal--and unending fame in this.      'Tis a high, yet certain duty--that my life I thus resign,      'Tis thy right, as thy advantage--both the willing deed enjoin--      All for which a wife is wedded--long erenow through me thou'st won,      Blooming son and gentle daughter--that my debt is paid and done.      Thou may'st well support our children--gently guard, when I am gone,      I shall have no power to guard them--nor support them, left alone.      Oh, despoiled of thy assistance--lord of me, and all I have,      How these little ones from ruin--how my hapless self to save:      Widow'd, reft of thee, and helpless--with two children in their youth,      How maintain my son, and daughter--in the path of right and truth.      From the lustful, from the haughty--how shall I our child protect,      When they seek thy blameless daughter--by a father's awe unchecked.      As the birds in numbers swarming--gather o'er the earth-strewn corn,      Thus the men round some sad widow--of her noble lord forlorn.      Thus by all the rude and reckless--with profane desires pursued,[154]      How shall I the path still follow--loved and honoured by the good.      This thy dear, thy only daughter--this pure maiden innocent,      How to teach the way of goodness--where her sire, her fathers went.      How can I instil the virtues--in the bosom of our child,      Helpless and beset on all sides--as thou would'st in duty skilled.      Round thy unprotected daughter--Sudras like[155] to holy lore,      Scorning me in their wild passion--will unworthy suitors pour.      And if I refuse to give her--mindful of thy virtuous course,      As the storks the rice of offering[156]--they will bear her off by force.      Should I see my son degenerate--like his noble sire no more,      In the power of the unworthy--the sweet daughter that I bore;      And myself, the world's scorn, wandering--so as scarce myself to know,      Of proud men the scoff, the outcast--I should die of shame and woe.      And bereft of me, my children--and without thy aid to cherish,      As the fish when water fails them--both would miserably perish.      Thus of all the three is ruin--the inevitable lot,      Desolate of thee, their guardian--wherefore, Oh, forsake us not!        The dark way before her husband--'tis a wife's first bliss to go,      'Tis a wife's that hath borne children--this the wise, the holy know.      For thee forsaken be my daughter--let my son forsaken be,      I for thee forsook my kindred--and forsake my life for thee.      More than offering 'tis, than penance--liberal gift or sacrifice,      When a wife, thus clearly summoned--for her husband's welfare dies.      That which now to do I hasten--all the highest duty feel,      For thy bliss, for thy well-doing--thine and all thy race's weal.    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19549"],[0,"The Mind of the Child, Part II (#17)"],[1,"oth, or in a  lisping fashion put S in place of Sch; more rarely Sch in place of S.  They say, e. g., _saf._ in place of \"Schaf,\" _int_ for \"singt,\" _anz_  for \"Salz,\" _lafen_ and _slafen_ for \"schlafen,\" _iss_ for \"Hirsch,\"  _pitte_ for \"Splitter,\" _tul_ for \"Stuhl,\" _wein_ for \"Schwein,\"  _Tuttav_ for \"Gustav,\" _torch_ for \"Storch\" (second year), _emele_ for  \"Schemel,\" _webenau_ for \"Fledermaus,\" but also _Kusch_ for \"Kuss.\" But  in no case have I myself heard a child regularly put \"sch\" in place of  _s_, as _Joschef_ for \"Josef.\" This form, perhaps, occurs in Jewish  families; but I have no further observations concerning it as yet.    _Rhotacism._--Many children do not form R at all for a long time and put  nothing in place of it. They say _duch_ for \"durch,\" _bot_ for \"Brot,\"  _unte_ for \"herunter,\" _tautech_ for \"traurig,\" _ule_ for \"Ruhe,\"  _taenen_ for \"Thraenen,\" _ukka_ for \"Zucker.\" On the contrary, some form  early the R lingual, guttural, and labial, but all confound now and then  the first two with each other.    _Lambdacism._--Many children are late in learning to utter L, and often  omit it. They say, e. g., _icht_ for \"Licht,\" _voge_ for \"Vogel,\"  _atenne_ for \"Laterne,\" _batn_ for \"Blatt,\" _mante_ for \"Mantel.\"    (2) Literal Pararthria or Paralalia.    Children who are beginning to repeat intentionally what is said, often  put another sound in place of the well-known correct (no doubt intended)  one; this on account of deficient control of the tongue or other  peripheral organs of speech. E. g., they say _t_ in place of _p_, or _b_  for _w_ (_basse_ for \"Wasser\" and for \"Flasche\"), _e_ for _i_ and _o_  for _u_, as in _bete_ for \"bitte,\" and _Ohr_ for \"Uhr.\"    _Paragammacism._--Children supply the place of the insuperably difficult  sounds G, K, X by others, especially D and T, also N, saying, e. g.,  _itte_ for \"Rike,\" _finne_ for \"Finger,\" _tein_ for \"Klein,\" _toss_ for  \"gross,\" _atitte_ for \"Karnickel,\" _otute_ for \"Kuk,\" _attall_ for  \"Axel,\" _wodal_ for \"Vogel,\" _tut_ for \"gut,\" _tatze_ for \"Katze.\"    _Parasigmatism._--Children are late in learning to utter S and Sch  correctly. They often supply the place of them, before acquiring them,  by other sounds, saying, e. g., _tule_ for \"Schule,\" _ade_ for \"Hase,\"  _webbe_ for \"Wasser,\" _beb_ for \"boes,\" _bebe_ for \"Besen,\" _gigod_ for  \"Schildkroete,\" _baubee_ for \"Schwalbe.\"    _Pararhotacism._--Most children, if not all, even when they have very  early formed R correctly (involuntarily), introduce other sounds in  place of it in speaking--e. g., they say _moigjen_ for \"morgen,\" _matta_  for \"Martha,\" _annold_ for \"Arnold,\" _jeiben_ for \"reiben,\" _amum_ for  \"warum,\" _welfen_ for \"werfen.\"    _Paralambdacism._--Many children who do not learn until late to utter L  put in its place other sounds; saying, e. g., _bind_ for \"Bild,\" _bampe_  for \"Lampe,\" _tinne_ for \"stille,\" _degen_ for \"legen,\" _wewe_ for  \"Loewe,\" _ewebau_ for \"Elephant.\"    (3) Bradylalia or Bradyarthria.    Children reciting for the first time something learned by heart  speak not always indistinctly, but, on account of the incomplete  practicability of the motor-paths, slowly, monotonously, without  modulation. Sounds and syllables do _not yet_ follow one another  quickly, although they are already formed correctly. The syllables  belonging to a word are often separated by pauses like the words  themselves--a sort of dysphasia-of-conduction on account of the more  difficult and prolonged conduction of the motor-impulse. I knew a boy  (feeble-minded, to be sure) who took from three to eight seconds for  answering even the simplest question; then came a regular explosion of  utterance. Yet he did not stutter or stammer. When he had only _yes_ or  _no_ to answer, the interval between question and answer was shorter.    Here belong in part also the imperfections of speech that are occasioned  by too large a tongue (macroglossia). When a child is born with too  large a tongue, he may remain long alalic, without the loss of  intellectual development, as was observed to be the case by Paster and  O. von Heusinger (1882).    II. DYSPHRASIA (DYSLOGICAL DISTURBANCES OF SPEECH).    The child that can already speak pretty correctly deforms his speech  after the manner of insane persons, being moved by strange caprices,  because his understanding is not yet sufficiently developed.    _Logorrhoea_ (_Loquaciousness_).--It is a regular occurrence with  children that their pleasure in articulation and in vocal sound often  induces them to hold long monologues, sometimes in articulate sounds and  syllables, sometimes not. This chattering is kept up till the grown  people present are weary, and that by children who can not yet talk; and  their screaming is often interrupted only by hoarseness, just as in the  case of the polyphrasia of the insane.    _Dysphrasia of the Melancholy._--Children exert themselves perceptibly  in their first attempts to speak, answer indolently or not at all, or  frequently with embarrassment, always slowly, often with drawl and  monotone, very frequently coming to a stop. They also sometimes begin to  speak, and then lose at once the inclination to go on.    _Dysphrasia of the Delirious_ (_Wahnsinnigen_).--Children that have begun  to speak often make new words for themselves. They have already invented  signs before this; they are also unintelligible often-times because they  use the words they have learned in a different sense.    _Dysphrasia of the Insane_ (_Verrueckten_).--The child is not yet  prepared to speak. He possesses only non-co-ordinated sounds and  isolated rudiments of words, primitive syllables, roots, as the  primitive raw material of the future speech.    In many insane persons only the disconnected remains or ruins of their  stock of words are left, so that their speech resembles that of the  child at a certain stage.    _Dysphrasia of the Feeble-minded._--The child at first reacts only upon  strong impressions, and that often indolently and clumsily and with  outcry; later, upon impressions of ordinary strength, without  understanding--laughing, crowing, uttering disconnected syllables.    So the patient reacts either upon strong impressions only, and that  indolently, bluntly, with gestures that express little and with rude  words, or he still reacts upon impressions of ordinary strength, but in  flat, silly, disconnected utterances.    _Dysphrasia of Idiots._--Children have command at the beginning of no  articulate sounds; then they learn these and syllables; after this also  words of one syllable; then they speak short words of more than one  syllable and sentences, but frequently babble forth words they have  heard without understanding their meaning, like parrots.    Imbeciles also frequently command only short words and sentences or  monosyllabic words and sounds, or, finally, they lack all articulate  sound. Many microcephalous idiots babble words without understanding  their meaning, like little children.    _Echo-speech or Echolalia_ (_Imitative Reflex Speech_).--Children not  yet able to frame a sentence correctly like to repeat the last word of a  sentence they have heard; and this, according to my observations and  researches, is so general that I am forced to call this echolalia a  physiological transition stage. Of long words said to them, the children  usually repeat only the last two syllables or the last syllable only.  The feeble-minded also repeat monotonously the words and sentences said  by a person in their neighborhood without showing an awakened attention,  and in general without connecting any idea with what they say.  (Romberg.)    _Interjectional Speech._--Children sometimes have a fancy for speaking  in interjections. They express vague ideas by single vowels (like _ae_),  syllables (e. g., _na_, _da_), and combinations of syllables, and  frequently call out aloud through the house meaningless sounds and  syllables. D and W are as yet undeveloped.    Often, too, children imitate the interjections used by members of the  family--_hop!_ _patsch_, _bauz!_ an interjectional echolalia. Many  deranged persons express their feelings in like manner, in sounds,  especially vowels, syllables, or sound-combinations resembling words,  which are void of meaning or are associated merely with obscure ideas  (Martini). Then D is connected with M only through L and S, and so  through _i_ and _e_.    _Embolophrasia._--Many children, long after they have overcome  acataphasia and agrammatism, delight in inserting between words sounds,  syllables, and words that do not belong there; e. g., they double the  last syllable of every word and put an _eff_ to it: _ich-ich-eff_, _bin  in-eff_, etc., or they make a kind of bleat between the words  (Kussmaul); and, in telling a story, put extra syllables into their  utterance while they are thinking.    Many adults likewise have the disagreeable habit of introducing certain  words or meaningless syllables into their speech, where these do not at  all belong; or they tack on diminutive endings to their words. The  syllables are often mere sounds, like _eh_, _uh_; in many cases they  sound like _eng_, _ang_ (angophrasia--Kussmaul).    _Palimphrasia._--Insane persons often repeat single sounds, syllables,  or sentences, over and over without meaning; e. g., \"I am-am-am-am.\"    \"The phenomenon in many cases reminds us of children, who say or sing  some word or phrase, a rhyme or little verse, so long continuously, like  automata, that the by-standers can endure it no longer. It is often the  ring of the words, often the sense, often both, by which the children  are impressed. The child repeats them because they seem to him strange  or very sonorous.\" (Kussmaul.)    _Bradyphrasia._--The speech of people that are sad or sleepy, and of  others whose mental processes are indolent, often drags along with  tedious slowness; is also liable to be broken off abruptly.
