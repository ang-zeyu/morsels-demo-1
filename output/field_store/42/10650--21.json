Dozens of dark men in  white linen clothes and turbans are waiting on these little chaps from  home, as they drop in. They are tubbed and towelled, shirts studded and  put on, and are fitted without hardly lifting a hand themselves till  they put the finishing touch to hair and moustache at the glasses and  dressing-tables that are fixed round the pillars--sounds like  effeminacy, but it is not, for it is far more tiring for a man to be  dressed here by two skilful servants than it is to dash into his clothes  at home by himself. If you were to dress here without help you might as  well have dropped into your bath all standing, you would be so wet and  uncomfortable; but all the same I think it is stupid the way we people  cling to a particular style of evening dress regardless of  circumstances.    Then home to the Taj in the dusk through a crowd of natives jammed tight  on the Bundar, all looking one way breathlessly at the fleet's fireworks  and search-lights. You touch them on the shoulder and say, \"With your  leave,\" and they make way most politely, and you wonder if it is because  you are British or because they have bare toes.    I went to the theatre in the evening, a native Theatre Royal. None of my  relations or friends seemed interested, so I availed myself of the kind  offer of guidance given me by a fellow artist, an amateur painter, but a  professional cutter of clothes. I expected something rather picturesque,  possibly rather squalid, but found it intensely interesting and  characteristic and very clean, a cross-between a little French theatre,  say in Monte Parnasse, and one of the lesser London theatres. The acting  was French in style and expressive, and full of humour and frankness,  and there was a quaint decorative style in all the tableaux and in the  actors' movements that made me think rather of Persian figures in  decorations than of India. There was a parterre and a wide gallery, in  which we got back seats; the audience were all men and well-dressed, and  laughed heartily at the points. These I was fortunate enough to have  most patiently described to me by a Syrian who sat beside me,  apple-faced and beaming, pleased with the play and himself as  interpreter. Besides his valued assistance, I had from the doorkeeper a  resume of the plot printed in English; my acquaintance was less  fortunate, for, owing to the house being full, we had to separate to  get seats, and I fear he lost a good deal of the interest. The Syrian  gave me the strong points of the different actors, and told me that he  himself was an importer of gold leaf and thread; he had, I think, one of  the jolliest faces I have ever seen. The most simple and telling effect  was when the Prime Minister found his young master sickened of love for  a beautiful lady, and sent to the bazaar for musicians and dancers; they  came and arranged themselves facing the audience in the front of the  stage in a perfectly decorative arrangement, struck in a moment. Every  turn of hand and poise of body and arrangement of colour suggested the  smiling figures you see on Persian illuminations. I forgot the effect on  the Prince--I wonder he didn't die before we left; he had been acting  hours before we came, and we only saw a portion of the play--left at  twelve, and must have been there three hours! As we drove home the  bazaars were still busy. One street struck me as peculiarly quiet. There  were Japs at balconies of low two-storied doll-houses, silhouetted  against lamplight which shone through their red fans and pink kimonos,  and other shabby houses with spindle-shanked darker natives, in white  draperies, also some larger people dimly seen, on long chairs, who my  friend said, were probably French--European at least. One or two groups  of rather orderly sailors, and a soldier or two, were all the people on  the street, and the only sound was \"Come eer', come eer'\" from the  balconies in various accents. The Edinburgh cafe I noticed, loomed large  and dark and very respectable looking in the middle of the street. I  suppose you could get drinks there on week days; my companion, the  cutter, did not take any drinks, so I think he must be thinking of  marriage. He was very interested in Art--what a bond that is, wider than  freemasonry, what good fellows artists are to each other the world  over--till they become Associates. This tailor was turned out of London  by the aliens; he spoke gently and pathetically of the way the  unscrupulous and insinuating foreigner works out the home-bred honest  man from London. \"If all was known,\" he said, \"aliens would be  restricted;\" and Blessed are the meek, I thought, for they shall inherit  the earth--if they only live long enough.    [Illustration: Lord Minto's Landing in India.]          CHAPTER XA      17th.--Everyone on the Apollo Bundar and in Bombay waited for the guns  to announce the arrival of the new Viceroy, and for The Mail; to mothers  and fathers just out, letters from little ones by the mail was perhaps  the more important event. Maharajahs, aide-de-camps, generals, and hosts  of officials were all trying to keep cool, to speed the parting Viceroy,  and welcome his successor with all proper ceremony. To understand and  describe how this was done is beyond my powers, therefore I must content  myself with a note here and there. It struck me as improper that the  cheers which welcomed the new Viceroy had practically to do duty for the  departure of Lord Curzon. They say, \"Le roi est mort, vive le Roi,\" but  in this case, \"Le Roi\" wasn't dead, but on the contrary must have been  painfully alive to the sounds of cannons booming and cheers ringing to  welcome his successor. I'd have had three or four days decent calm for  the Empire to note the departure of so great an actor in its history.  Then, after silence and fasting; fresh paint and flags for the new  arrival!    Monday afternoon.--Guns fire, and the new Viceroy on the P. & O. steamer  arrives in the bay. As she steams through the fleet, the hot air  resounds with thunder of guns, and smoke accumulates. Now she is passing  the _Renown_ and _Terrible_, and the smoke hangs so thick that the hills  and ships are almost hidden, and you can only see the yellow flashes  through the banks of grey smoke.    As Lord Minto landed at the Bundar, the sun was setting and the lamps  were lit, and a soft breeze offshore floated out the flags against the  glow of the sunset.    18th.--Made a jotting of the departure of Lord Curzon from the Apollo  Bundar. It was a very brilliant affair; any number of white uniforms  sparkling with gold, and ladies in exquisite dresses, and with cameras  with which they shot the departing couple from the stone buttresses.  Lady Curzon was in soft silk and muslin crepe-de-chine, I think, a  colour between pale green and violet, possibly a little of both. It was  a very pretty dress and with a parasol to match. They went down the  steps and the red carpet to the cheers of people on the pier. This  effective carpet with the white edge has figured a good deal lately in  various ceremonies; the Prince and Princess went up and down it, and  Viceroys and Vicereines, and many Generals and Maharajahs. It ought to  be preserved by the municipality.    I thought I'd condescend just for once to try a photo on this occasion,  as Lord Curzon went down the steps to the tender, and I believe I lost  in consequence, by the fraction of a second, a mental picture that I'd  have treasured for the rest of my days and have possibly reduced to  paint. Just as the whole scene was coming to a point when the least  movement on the part of the principal figures one way or the other would  take away from the effect; when Lord Curzon turned on the landing in the  middle of the steps to say farewell, I had to look down at my pesky  little camera to pull the trigger! So my mind is left blank just where I  know there should be a telling arrangement, just such a moment as that  painted in \"The Spears,\" the Breda picture, where the principal actors  and the others are caught in the very nick of time--the camera will now  rest on the shelf beside a rhyming dictionary and the Encyclopaedia  Britannica.    Lord Curzon said a few words to the people near him before going down  the last steps into the launch, and it in the meantime gently and  perseveringly smoked the ticket-holders on the buttress of the pier  opposite us; and we ticket-holders and G. P. on our buttress smiled at  their pained expressions--our time was to come. It stopped smoking, held  its breath as it were, and came slowly under us, and Lady Curzon looked  up from under the awning in the stern with a charming smile, and all our  topees came off or white gloved hands went up in salute to beautiful  white helmets--and our turn came!--the launch gave a snort, and we felt  a pleasant, cool rain from condensed steam, and thought it refreshing as  it fell on our faces. Then we grinned as we looked at our neighbours;  and then realized that we too were black as sweeps, topees, white  helmets, and uniforms all covered with a fine black oily rain. I've a  new topee to charge against one or other of the Viceroys or  Government--General Pretyman hardly looked his name--and during the rest  of the function of the return from the Bundar of Lord Minto and his  retainers, you could tell by his grey speckled side what position in the  preceding function a spectator had occupied. A Parsi, in neat black  frock-coat and Brunswick black hat, and dark face, remarked to me with a  smile, \"You see the advantage of a little colour,\"--bit of a wag I  thought!    Altogether it was a very A.1. sight the colour Veronesque; the troops,  rajahs, beautiful ladies in exquisite latest dresses, and the variety of  type, European and native, made a splendid subject for a historical  picture.    Then the new Viceroy left the Shamiana on the Bundar after making a"]]]
