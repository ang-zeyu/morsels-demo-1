This scheme developed itself by degrees. It was not thought safe to  begin by granting to the whole Roman Catholic body a dispensation from  all statutes imposing penalties and tests. For nothing was more fully  established than that such a dispensation was illegal. The Cabal had,  in 1672, put forth a general Declaration of Indulgence. The Commons,  as soon as they met, had protested against it. Charles the Second had  ordered it to be cancelled in his presence, and had, both by his own  mouth and by a written message, assured the Houses that the step which  had caused so much complaint should never be drawn into precedent. It  would have been difficult to find in all the Inns of Court a barrister  of reputation to argue in defence of a prerogative which the Sovereign,  seated on his throne in full Parliament, had solemnly renounced a few  years before. But it was not quite so clear that the King might not,  on special grounds, grant exemptions to individuals by name. The first  object of James, therefore, was to obtain from the courts of common  law an acknowledgment that, to this extent at least, he possessed the  dispensing power.    But, though his pretensions were moderate when compared with those which  he put forth a few months later, he soon found that he had against him  almost the whole sense of Westminster Hall. Four of the Judges gave him  to understand that they could not, on this occasion, serve his purpose;  and it is remarkable that all the four were violent Tories, and that  among them were men who had accompanied Jeffreys on the Bloody Circuit,  and who had consented to the death of Cornish and of Elizabeth Gaunt.  Jones, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, a man who had never before  shrunk from any drudgery, however cruel or servile, now held in the  royal closet language which might have become the lips of the purest  magistrates in our history. He was plainly told that he must either  give up his opinion or his place. \"For my place,\" he answered, \"I care  little. I am old and worn out in the service of the crown; but I am  mortified to find that your Majesty thinks me capable of giving a  judgment which none but an ignorant or a dishonest man could give.\" \"I  am determined,\" said the King, \"to have twelve Judges who will be all  of my mind as to this matter.\" \"Your Majesty,\" answered Jones, \"may  find twelve Judges of your mind, but hardly twelve lawyers.\" [82] He was  dismissed together with Montague, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and  two puisne Judges, Neville and Charlton. One of the new Judges was  Christopher Milton, younger brother of the great poet. Of Christopher  little is known except that, in the time of the civil war, he had been  a Royalist, and that he now, in his old age, leaned towards Popery. It  does not appear that he was ever formally reconciled to the Church of  Rome: but he certainly had scruples about communicating with the Church  of England, and had therefore a strong interest in supporting the  dispensing power. [83]    The King found his counsel as refractory as his Judges. The first  barrister who learned that he was expected to defend the dispensing  power was the Solicitor General, Heneage Finch. He peremptorily refused,  and was turned out of office on the following day. [84] The Attorney  General, Sawyer, was ordered to draw warrants authorising members of  the Church of Rome to hold benefices belonging to the Church of England.  Sawyer had been deeply concerned in some of the harshest and most  unjustifiable prosecutions of that age; and the Whigs abhorred him as a  man stained with the blood of Russell and Sidney: but on this occasion  he showed no want of honesty or of resolution. \"Sir,\" said he, \"this is  not merely to dispense with a statute; it is to annul the whole statute  law from the accession of Elizabeth to this day. I dare not do it; and I  implore your Majesty to consider whether such an attack upon the rights  of the Church be in accordance with your late gracious promises.\" [85]  Sawyer would have been instantly dismissed as Finch had been, if the  government could have found a successor: but this was no easy matter. It  was necessary for the protection of the rights of the crown that one  at least of the crown lawyers should be a man of learning, ability, and  experience; and no such man was willing to defend the dispensing power.  The Attorney General was therefore permitted to retain his place  during some months. Thomas Powis, an insignificant man, who had no  qualification for high employment except servility, was appointed  Solicitor.    The preliminary arrangements were now complete. There was a Solicitor  General to argue for the dispensing power, and twelve Judges to decide  in favour of it. The question was therefore speedily brought to a  hearing. Sir Edward Hales, a gentleman of Kent, had been converted  to Popery in days when it was not safe for any man of note openly to  declare himself a Papist. He had kept his secret, and, when questioned,  had affirmed that he was a Protestant with a solemnity which did little  credit to his principles. When James had ascended the throne, disguise  was no longer necessary. Sir Edward publicly apostatized, and was  rewarded with the command of a regiment of foot. He had held his  commission more than three months without taking the sacrament. He was  therefore liable to a penalty of five hundred pounds, which an informer  might recover by action of debt. A menial servant was employed to bring  a suit for this sum in the Court of King's Bench. Sir Edward did not  dispute the facts alleged against him, but pleaded that he had letters  patent authorising him to hold his commission notwithstanding the Test  Act. The plaintiff demurred, that is to say, admitted Sir Edward's plea  to be true in fact, but denied that it was a sufficient answer. Thus was  raised a simple issue of law to be decided by the court. A barrister,  who was notoriously a tool of the government, appeared for the mock  plaintiff, and made some feeble objections to the defendant's plea. The  new Solicitor General replied. The Attorney General took no part in the  proceedings. Judgment was given by the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Edward  Herbert. He announced that he had submitted the question to all the  twelve Judges, and that, in the opinion of eleven of them, the King  might lawfully dispense with penal statutes in particular cases, and  for special reasons of grave importance. The single dissentient, Baron  Street, was not removed from his place. He was a man of morals so bad  that his own relations shrank from him, and that the Prince of Orange,  at the time of the Revolution, was advised not to see him. The character  of Street makes it impossible to believe that he would have been more  scrupulous than his brethren. The character of James makes it impossible  to believe that a refractory Baron of the Exchequer would have been  permitted to retain his post. There can be no reasonable doubt that the  dissenting Judge was, like the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel,  acting collusively. It was important that there should be a great  preponderance of authority in favour of the dispensing power; yet it  was important that the bench, which had been carefully packed for the  occasion, should appear to be independent. One Judge, therefore,  the least respectable of the twelve, was permitted, or more probably  commanded, to give his voice against the prerogative. [86]    The power which the courts of law had thus recognised was not suffered  to lie idle. Within a month after the decision of the King's Bench  had been pronounced, four Roman Catholic Lords were sworn of the Privy  Council. Two of these, Powis and Bellasyse, were of the moderate  party, and probably took their seats with reluctance and with many sad  forebodings. The other two, Arundell and Dover, had no such misgivings.  [87]    The dispensing power was, at the same time, employed for the purpose  of enabling Roman Catholics to hold ecclesiastical preferment. The new  Solicitor readily drew the warrants in which Sawyer had refused to be  concerned. One of these warrants was in favour of a wretch named Edward  Sclater, who had two livings which he was determined to keep at all  costs and through all changes. He administered the sacrament to his  parishioners according to the rites of the Church of England on Palm  Sunday 1686. On Easter Sunday, only seven days later, he was at mass.  The royal dispensation authorised him to retain the emoluments of his  benefices. To the remonstrances of the patrons from whom he had received  his preferment he replied in terms of insolent defiance, and, while the  Roman Catholic cause prospered, put forth an absurd treatise in defence  of his apostasy. But, a very few weeks after the Revolution, a great  congregation assembled at Saint Mary's in the Savoy, to see him received  again into the bosom of the Church which he had deserted. He read his  recantation with tears flowing from his eyes, and pronounced a bitter  invective against the Popish priests whose arts had seduced him. [88]    Scarcely less infamous was the conduct of Obadiah Walker. He was an aged  priest of the Church of England, and was well known in the University of  Oxford as a man of learning. He had in the late reign been suspected of  leaning towards Popery, but had outwardly conformed to the established  religion, and had at length been chosen Master of University College.  Soon after the accession of James, Walker determined to throw off the  disguise which he had hitherto worn. He absented himself from the  public worship of the Church of England, and, with some fellows and  undergraduates whom he had perverted, heard mass daily in his own  apartments. One of the first acts performed by the new Solicitor General  was to draw up an instrument which authorised Walker and his proselytes  to hold their benefices,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/244"],[0,"A Study in Scarlet (#17)"],[1,"III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.      THREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had  departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier's heart was sore within him  when he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending loss of  his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to  the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always  determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever  induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he  regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever  he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was  inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to  express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in  the Land of the Saints.    Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared  only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something  which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a  swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned  persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most  terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German  Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put  a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over  the State of Utah.    Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made  this organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and  omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out  against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or  what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,  but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the  hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed  by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this  terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men  went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the  wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.    At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the  recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards  to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The  supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female  population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange  rumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and  rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women  appeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and  bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated  wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,  stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These  tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and  re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.  To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite  Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.    Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible  results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it  inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless  society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and  violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.  The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the  Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at  night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every  man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were  nearest his heart.    One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,  when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,  saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His  heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham  Young himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded  him little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The  latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with  a stern face into the sitting-room.    \"Brother Ferrier,\" he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly  from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \"the true believers have been  good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the  desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,  gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our  protection. Is not this so?\"    \"It is so,\" answered John Ferrier.    \"In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you  should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.  This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have  neglected.\"    \"And how have I neglected it?\" asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in  expostulation. \"Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended  at the Temple? Have I not----?\"    \"Where are your wives?\" asked Young, looking round him. \"Call them in,  that I may greet them.\"    \"It is true that I have not married,\" Ferrier answered. \"But women  were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a  lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\"    \"It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\" said the leader  of the Mormons. \"She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found  favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\"    John Ferrier groaned internally.    \"There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that  she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.  What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?  'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if  she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.' This being so, it is  impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your  daughter to violate it.\"    John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his  riding-whip.    \"Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been  decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would  not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all  choice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also  be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of  them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose  between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say  you to that?\"    Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.    \"You will give us time,\" he said at last. \"My daughter is very  young--she is scarce of an age to marry.\"    \"She shall have a month to choose,\" said Young, rising from his seat.  \"At the end of that time she shall give her answer.\"    He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and  flashing eyes. \"It were better for you, John Ferrier,\" he thundered,  \"that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra  Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of  the Holy Four!\"    With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and  Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.    He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he  should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon  his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her  pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.    \"I could not help it,\" she said, in answer to his look. \"His voice rang  through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\"    \"Don't you scare yourself,\" he answered, drawing her to him, and passing  his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \"We'll fix it  up somehow or another. You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for  this chap, do you?\"    A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.    \"No; of course not. I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. He's a  likely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in  spite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party starting for  Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him know  the hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back  here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\"    Lucy laughed through her tears at her father's description.    \"When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that  I am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about  those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to  them.\"    \"But we haven't opposed him yet,\" her father answered. \"It will be time  to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at  the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\"    \"Leave Utah!\"    \"That's about the size of it.\"    \"But the farm?\"    \"We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell  the truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing it. I  don't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their  darned prophet. I'm a free-born American, and it's all new to me. Guess  I'm too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might  chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite  direction.\"    \"But they won't let us leave,\" his daughter objected.    \"Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. In the meantime,  don't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes swelled up,  else he'll be walking into me when"]]]
