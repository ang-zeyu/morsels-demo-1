After Mr.  Lyne drove off I went to the door of the house to get a little fresh air,  and I was standing on the top step when it came up. If you notice, sir,  it's marked 'received at 9.20'--that means the time it was received at  the District Post Office, and that's about two miles from our place. It  couldn't possibly have got to the house before Mr. Lyne left, and I was  scared to death that you clever gentlemen would have seen that.\"    \"I was so clever that I didn't see it,\" admitted Tarling with a smile.  \"Thank you, Mr. Cole, that will do.\"    When the man had gone, he sat down on a chair opposite Whiteside and  thrust his hands into his pockets with a gesture of helplessness.    \"Well, I'm baffled,\" he said. \"Let me recite the case, Whiteside, because  it's getting so complicated that I'm almost forgetting its plainest  features. On the night of the fourteenth Thornton Lyne is murdered by  some person or persons unknown, presumably in the flat of Odette Rider,  his former cashier, residing at Carrymore Mansions. Bloodstains are found  upon the floor, and there is other evidence, such as the discovery of the  pistol and the spent bullet, which emphasises the accuracy of that  conclusion. Nobody sees Mr. Lyne come into the flat or go out. He is  found in Hyde Park the next morning without his coat or vest, a lady's  silk night-dress, identified as Odette Rider's, wrapped tightly round his  breast, and two of Odette Rider's handkerchiefs are found over the wound.  Upon his body are a number of daffodils, and his car, containing his  coat, vest and boots, is found by the side of the road a hundred yards  away. Have I got it right?\"    Whiteside nodded.    \"Whatever else is at fault,\" he smiled, \"your memory is unchallengeable.\"    \"A search of the bedroom in which the crime was committed reveals a  bloodstained thumb-print on the white bureau, and a suit-case, identified  as Odette Rider's, half-packed upon the bed. Later, a pistol, which is  mine, is found in the lady's work-basket, hidden under repairing  material. The first suggestion is that Miss Rider is the murderess.  That suggestion is refuted, first by the fact that she was at Ashford  when the murder was committed, unconscious as a result of a railway  accident; and the second point in her favour is that the telegram  discovered by Lyne's valet, purporting to be signed by the girl, inviting  Lyne to her flat at a certain hour, was not delivered to the murdered  man.\"    He rose to his feet.    \"Come along and see Cresswell,\" he said. \"This case is going to drive me  mad!\"    Assistant Commissioner Cresswell heard the story the two men had to tell,  and if he was astounded he did not betray any signs of his surprise.    \"This looks like being the murder case of the century,\" he said. \"Of  course, you cannot proceed any further against Miss Rider, and you were  wise not to make the arrest. However, she must be kept under observation,  because apparently she knows, or think she knows, the person who did  commit the murder. She must be watched day and night, and sooner or  later, she will lead you to the man upon whom her suspicions rest.    \"Whiteside had better see her,\" he said, turning to Tarling. \"He may  get a new angle of her view. I don't think there's much use in bringing  her down here. And, by-the-way, Tarling, all the accounts of Lyne's  Stores have been placed in the hands of a clever firm of chartered  accountants--Dashwood and Solomon, of St. Mary Axe. If you suspect there  has been any peculation on the part of Lyne's employees, and if that  peculation is behind the murder, we shall probably learn something which  will give you a clue.\"    Tarling nodded.    \"How long will the examination take?\" he asked.    \"They think a week. The books have been taken away this morning--which  reminds me that your friend, Mr. Milburgh--I think that is his name--is  giving every assistance to the police to procure a faithful record of the  firm's financial position.\"    He looked up at Tarling and scratched his nose.    \"So it was committed with your pistol, Tarling?\" he said with a little  smile. \"That sounds bad.\"    \"It sounds mad,\" laughed Tarling. \"I'm going straight back to discover  what happened to my pistol and how it got into that room. I know that  it was safe a fortnight ago because I took it to a gunsmith to be oiled.\"    \"Where do you keep it as a rule?\"    \"In the cupboard with my colonial kit,\" said Tarling. \"Nobody has access  to my room except Ling Chu, who is always there when I'm out.\"    \"Ling Chu is your Chinese servant?\"    \"Not exactly a servant,\" smiled Tarling. \"He is one of the best native  thief catchers I have ever met. He is a man of the greatest integrity and  I would trust him with my life.\"    \"Murdered with your pistol, eh?\" asked the Commissioner.    There was a little pause and then:    \"I suppose Lyne's estate will go to the Crown? He has no relations and no  heir.\"    \"You're wrong there,\" said Tarling quietly.    The Commissioner looked up in surprise.    \"Has he an heir?\" he asked.    \"He has a cousin,\" said Tarling with a little smile, \"a relationship  close enough to qualify him for Lyne's millions, unfortunately.\"    \"Why unfortunately?\" asked Mr. Cresswell.    \"Because I happen to be the heir,\" said Tarling.          CHAPTER XVII    THE MISSING REVOLVER      Tarling walked out of Scotland Yard on to the sunlit Embankment, trouble  in his face. He told himself that the case was getting beyond him and  that it was only the case and its development which worried him. The  queer little look which had dawned on the Commissioner's face when he  learnt that the heir to the murdered Thornton Lyne's fortune was the  detective who was investigating his murder, and that Tarling's revolver  had been found in the room where the murder had been committed, aroused  nothing but an inward chuckle.    That suspicion should attach to him was, he told himself, poetic justice,  for in his day he himself had suspected many men, innocent or partly  innocent.    He walked up the stairs to his room and found Ling Chu polishing  the meagre stock of silver which Tarling possessed. Ling Chu was a  thief-catcher and a great detective, but he had also taken upon himself  the business of attending to Tarling's personal comfort. The detective  spoke no word, out went straight to the cupboard where he kept his  foreign kit. On a shelf in neat array and carefully folded, were the thin  white drill suits he wore in the tropics. His sun helmet hung on a peg,  and on the opposite wall was a revolver holster hanging by a strap. He  lifted the holster. It was empty. He had had no doubts in his mind that  the holster would be empty and closed the door with a troubled frown.    \"Ling Chu,\" he said quietly.    \"You speak me, Lieh Jen?\" said the man, putting down the spoons and  rubber he was handling.    \"Where is my revolver?\"    \"It is gone, Lieh Jen,\" said the man calmly.    \"How long has it been gone?\"    \"I miss him four days,\" said Ling Chu calmly;    \"Who took it?\" demanded Tarling.    \"I miss him four days,\" said the man.    There was an interval of silence, and Tarling nodded his head slowly.    \"Very good, Ling Chu,\" he said, \"there is no more to be said.\"    For all his outward calm, he was distressed in mind.    Was it possible that anybody could have got into the room in Ling Chu's  absence--he could only remember one occasion when they had been out  together, and that was the night he had gone to the girl's flat and Ling  Chu had shadowed him.    What if Ling Chu----?    He dismissed the thought as palpably absurd. What interest could Ling Chu  have in the death of Lyne, whom he had only seen once, the day that  Thornton Lyne had called Tarling into consultation at the Stores?    That thought was too fantastic to entertain, but nevertheless it recurred  again and again to him and in the end he sent his servant away with a  message to Scotland Yard, determined to give even his most fantastic  theory as thorough and impartial an examination as was possible.    The flat consisted of four rooms and a kitchen. There was Tarling's  bedroom communicating with his dining and sitting-room. There was a  spare-room in which he kept his boxes and trunks--it was in this room  that the revolver had been put aside--and there was the small room  occupied by Ling Chu. He gave his attendant time to get out of the  house and well on his journey before he rose from the deep chair where  he had been sitting in puzzled thought and began his inspection.    Ling Chu's room was small and scrupulously clean. Save for the bed and  a plain black-painted box beneath the bed, there was no furniture. The  well-scrubbed boards were covered with a strip of Chinese matting and the  only ornamentation in the room was supplied by a tiny red lacquer vase  which stood on the mantelpiece.    Tarling went back to the outer door of the flat and locked it before  continuing his search. If there was any clue to the mystery of the stolen  revolver it would be found here, in this black box. A Chinaman keeps all  his possessions \"within six sides,\" as the saying goes, and certainly the  box was very well secured. It was ten minutes before he managed to find a  key to shift the two locks with which it was fastened.    The contents of the box were few. Ling Chu's wardrobe was not an  extensive one and did little more than half fill the receptacle. Very  carefully he lifted out the one suit of clothes, the silk shirts, the  slippers and the odds and ends of the Chinaman's toilet and came quickly  to the lower layer. Here he discovered two lacquer boxes, neither of  which were locked or fastened.    The first of these contained sewing material, the second a small package  wrapped in native paper and carefully tied about with ribbon. Tarling  undid the ribbon, opened the package and found to his surprise a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#17)"],[1,"in painting. It is therefore rarely used unbroken, as the  ruling or predominating colour, or for toning a picture; on which  account it will always seem detached or insulated, unless repeated and  subordinated. Hence Nature is sparing with her red, employing it with as  much reserve in the decoration of her works as she is profuse in  lavishing green upon them. This latter is of all colours the most  soothing to the eye, and the true contrasting or harmonizing equivalent  of red, in the proportional quantity of eleven to five, according to  surface or intensity: being, when the red inclines to scarlet or orange,  a _blue_-green; and when it tends to crimson or purple, a  _yellow_-green.    Red breaks and diffuses with white with peculiar loveliness. It is  discordant when standing with orange only, requiring to be joined or  accompanied by their proper contrast, to resolve or harmonize the  dissonance. In landscapes, &c., abounding with hues allied to green, a  red object properly placed as regards light, shade, or distance,  conduces wonderfully to the life, beauty, harmony, and connexion of the  colouring. Red is, indeed, the chief element of beauty in floral nature,  the prime ornament of the green garb of the vegetal kingdom.    Being the most _positive_ of colours, and holding the middle station of  the primaries, red contrasts and harmonizes with black and white, which  are the _negative_ powers or neutrals of colours, and the extremes of  the scale. Moreover, as red is less nearly allied to black or shade than  to white or light, this harmony is most remarkable in the union or  opposition of white and red, and this contrast most powerful in black  and red.    As a primary and simple colour, red cannot be composed by mixture of  other colours. So much is it the instrument of beauty in nature and art  in flesh, flowers, &c., that good pigments of this genus are most  indispensable. On the whole, the palette cannot be considered so well  furnished with reds as with yellows. Especially is there wanting a  permanent transparent scarlet, a colour for which a prize of £500 has  for many years been offered by the Society of Arts.    68. CADMIUM RED.    The deep, pale, and lemon yellows which cadmium at first afforded, were  followed by an orange, which has quite recently been succeeded by a red.  This is a most vivid orange-scarlet, the red predominating, of exceeding  depth, and intense fire. It is a simple original pigment, containing no  base but cadmium, and possessing a large amount of latent colour. It is  more orange in hue than vermilion, and has the advantages of flowing and  drying well, of greater brilliancy, of retaining that brilliancy when  dry, and of considerable transparency. Hence this red is preferably  employed where opacity is to be avoided--in sunset clouds for instance.  As day declines or by artificial light, the colour approaches very  nearly to a deep pure scarlet; and the best substitute for a permanent  transparent scarlet which has yet been obtained is furnished by  admixture of cadmium red with madder carmine, or by using the latter as  a glaze. Compounded with white, the red yields a series of fine flesh  tints; and it mixes readily and safely with other colours. Without  harshness or rankness, neither injured by an impure atmosphere nor  exposure to light and air, cadmium red is eligible in every department  of art, enamel painting only excepted. In illumination, the red  contrasted by viridian will be found most beautiful and effective.  Seeing that previous to its introduction the number of bright reds, not  being crimson, nor of a crimson cast, was limited to vermilions, pure  scarlet, red chrome, and red lead, of which the first alone were  permanent, there was room on the palette for a strictly durable and  somewhat transparent pigment like cadmium red, with its many distinctive  properties.      COCHINEAL LAKES.    Lake, a term derived from the _lac_ or _lacca_ of India, is the name of  a number of transparent red and other coloured pigments of great beauty,  prepared for the most part by precipitating coloured tinctures of dyeing  drugs upon aluminous bases. Consequently, the lakes form a numerous  class, both with respect to the variety of their appellations, and the  substances whence they are produced. Those under notice are known as  _Carmine_, _Crimson Lake_, _Scarlet Lake_, _Purple Lake_, _Chinese  Lake_, _Florentine Lake_, _Hamburgh Lake_, _Roman Lake_, _Venetian  Lake_, &c., and are obtained from the \"coccus cacti,\" an insect found on  a species of cactus, from the juice of which it extracts its  nourishment. This coccus is a native of Mexico, where two kinds are  recognised, under names which signify wild cochineal and fine cochineal.  The latter may be considered a cultivated product, its food and wants  being carefully attended to, while the former is left in a natural  state, and is less valuable. Wild cochineal is distinguished by having a  woolly downy coat, which is not the case with the fine cochineal. The  females, of which there are from one hundred and fifty to two hundred  for each male, are marked by the absence of wings, and constitute the  commercial article. They are generally killed by immersion in boiling  water, which causes them to swell to twice their natural size, and are  then dried and packed for market. The insects shrivel in drying, and  assume the form of irregular grains, fluted and concave. The best sorts  have a silvery-grey colour, with a purplish reflection, and seem to be  dusted with a white powder. This appearance is often given by means of  heavy spar, carbonate of lead, Venice talc, &c. A good lens, however,  will mostly expose the fraud; or it may be detected by macerating the  insect in water, and allowing the loosened pulverised particles to  settle.    Cochineal is a very rich colouring substance, yielding about half its  weight of real colouring matter, which may be easily extracted by  boiling in water. Dr. Warren De La Rue, who examined the living animal,  states that on piercing the side of the insect a purplish-red fluid  exuded, containing the colouring matter in minute granules. This  colouring matter he succeeded in obtaining pure, in the form of a  purple-brown friable mass, pulverizable to a fine red powder,  transparent when viewed by the microscope, and soluble both in water and  alcohol in all proportions. At temperatures above 136° it decomposed,  and by alkalies its colour was turned to purple. These facts account for  the care required in drying cochineal lakes, and for their liability to  change of hue when in contact with alkaline substances, as in mural  decoration.    The lakes of cochineal may be known from those of the dye-woods by their  solubility in ammonia, a liquid which purples but does not dissolve the  colours produced from the latter.    69. CARMINE.    A name once given only to the fine feculences of kermes and cochineal  tinctures, now denotes generally any pigment which resembles them in  beauty, richness of hue, and powdery texture. We have, therefore, blue  and other coloured carmines, though the term is usually confined to the  crimson and scarlet lakes of cochineal. As at present commonly  understood, carmine is that preparation of cochineal which contains the  most colouring matter and the least aluminous base. Hence it is the  richest, deepest, most intense, and most permanent. Although not to be  classed as durable, yet by reason of its extreme depth, carmine is more  stable than the weaker crimson, scarlet, and purple lakes. When  well-made, pure, and employed alone and in body, it has been known to  retain its colour for years, especially if protected by oil or varnish.  In tint with white lead, however, it has no stability; and though little  affected by impure air, in glazing it is soon discoloured and destroyed  by the action of light. Of great power in its full touches, it possesses  considerable clearness in the pale washes, and works admirably. In  landscape, carmine is seldom used, the colour being chiefly valued in  flower painting and illumination.    It has been erroneously stated that the finest carmines cannot be made  in England, owing to a want of clearness in the atmosphere and a  scarcity of sunshine. For many years, however, they have been produced  in this country, not only finer than any foreign preparations, but  equally good in winter as in summer.    Carmine is sometimes sophisticated with starch, vermilion, and with  alumina not formed in the process of manufacture. Occasionally also, a  portion of the animal matter of the cochineal from which it has been  obtained is left mixed with it. These accidental or intentional  impurities may mostly be detected by heating the carmine with liquid  ammonia, which entirely dissolves the colouring matter and leaves the  impurities in an insoluble state.    70. CRIMSON LAKE    Is a cochineal pigment containing more aluminous base than carmine, and  is consequently weaker in colour and less stable. Deficient in much of  the depth and brilliancy which belong to the latter, it is more commonly  employed and more generally useful. This lake is of service in mixing  tints, to impart richness, in flower painting and illumination, and is,  like all cochineal colours, of greater utility in water than in oil.  With cobalt and gamboge it yields an excellent gray, and with cobalt  alone a fine purple for heather. Distant hills may be strengthened with  a tint of French blue and lake, and Vandyke brown with the crimson will  be found admirable for a rich coloured foreground. Many other beautiful  tints, unexceptionable in an artistic sense, are afforded by crimson  lake on admixture. It should be remembered, however, that not one of  them is permanent as far as the lake is concerned. All cochineal  pigments are more or less affected by strong light, which weakens their  tints, and in time deprives them of colour; and it is"]]]
