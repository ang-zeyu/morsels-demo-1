In autumn, the best feed will be the grasses of the pastures, so far as  they are available, green-corn fodder, cabbage, carrot, and turnip  leaves, and an addition of meal or shorts. Toward the middle of autumn,  the cows fed in the pastures will require to be housed regularly at  night, especially in the more northern latitudes, and put, in part at  least, upon hay. But every farmer knows that it is not judicious to feed  out the best part of his hay when his cattle are first put into the  barn, and that he should not feed so well in the early part of winter  that he cannot feed better as the winter advances.    At the same time, it should always be borne in mind that the change from  grass to a poor quality of hay or straw, for cows in milk, should not be  too sudden. A poor quality of dry hay is far less palatable in the early  part of winter, after the cows are taken from grass, than at a later  period; and, if it is resorted to with milch cows, will invariably lead  to a falling off in the milk, which no good feed can afterward wholly  restore.    It is desirable, therefore, for the farmer to know what can be used  instead of his best English or upland meadow hay, and yet not suffer any  greater loss in the flow of milk, or in condition, than is absolutely  necessary. In some sections of the Eastern States, the best quality of  swale hay will be used; and the composition of that is as variable as  possible, depending on the varieties of the grasses of which it was  made, and the manner of curing. But, in other sections, many will find  it necessary to use straw and other substitutes. Taking good English or  meadow hay as the standard of comparison, and calling that one, 4.79  times the weight of rye-straw, or 3.83 times the weight of oat-straw,  contains the same amount of nutritive matter; that is, it would take  4.79 times as good rye-straw to produce the same result as good meadow  hay.    In winter, the best food for cows in milk will be good sweet meadow hay,  a part of which should be cut and moistened with water--as all inferior  hay or straw should be--with an addition of root-crops, such as turnips,  carrots, parsnips, potatoes, mangold-wurtzel, with shorts, oil-cake,  Indian meal, or bean meal.    It is the opinion of most successful dairymen that the feeding of moist  food cannot be too highly recommended for cows in milk, especially to  those who desire to obtain the largest quantity. Hay cut and thoroughly  moistened becomes more succulent and nutritive, and partakes more of the  nature of green grass.    As a substitute for the oil-cake, hitherto known as an exceedingly  valuable article for feeding stock, there is probably nothing better  than cotton-seed meal. This is an article whose economic value has been  but recently made known, but which, from practical trials already made,  has proved eminently successful as food for milch cows. Chemists have  decided that its composition is not inferior to that of the best  flaxseed cake, and that in some respects its agricultural value  surpasses that of any other kind of oil-cake.    It has been remarked by chemists, in this connection, that the great  value of linseed-cake, as an adjunct to hay, for fat cattle and milch  cows, has been long recognized; and that it is undeniably traceable, in  the main, to three ingredients of the seeds of the oil-yielding plants.  The value of food depends upon the quantities of matters it contains  which may be appropriated by the animal which consumes the food Now, it  is proved that the fat of animals is derived from the starch, gum, and  sugar, and more directly and easily from the oil of the food. These four  substances, then, are fat-formers. The muscles, nerves, and tendons of  animals, the brine of their blood and the curd of their milk, are almost  identical in composition with, and strongly similar in many of their  properties to, matters found in all vegetables, but chiefly in such as  form the most concentrated food. These blood (and muscle) formers are  characterized by containing about fifteen and a half per cent. of  nitrogen; and hence are called nitrogenous substances. They are, also,  often designated as the albuminous bodies.    The bony framework of the animal owes its solidity to phosphate of lime,  and this substance must be furnished by the food. A perfect food must  supply the animal with these three classes of bodies, and in proper  proportions. The addition of a small quantity of a food, rich in oil and  albuminous substances, to the ordinary kinds of feed, which contain a  large quantity of vegetable fibre or woody matter, more or less  indigestible, but, nevertheless, indispensable to the herbivorous  animals, their digestive organs being adapted to a bulky food, has been  found highly advantageous in practice. Neither hay alone nor  concentrated food alone gives the best results. A certain combination of  the two presents the most advantages.    Some who have used cotton-seed cake have found difficulty in inducing  cattle to eat it. By giving it at first in small doses, mixed with other  palatable food, they soon learn to eat it with relish. Cotton-seed cake  is much richer in oils and albuminous matters than the linseed cake. A  correspondingly less quantity will therefore be required. Three pounds  of this cotton-seed cake are equivalent to four of linseed cake of  average quality.    During the winter season, as has been already remarked, a frequent  change of food is especially necessary, both as contributions to the  general health of animals, and as a means of stimulating the digestive  organs, and thus increasing the secretion of milk. A mixture used as cut  feed and well moistened is now especially beneficial, since concentrated  food, which would otherwise be given in small quantities, may be united  with larger quantities of coarser and less nutritive food, and the  complete assimilation of the whole be better secured. On this subject it  has been sensibly observed that the most nutritious kinds of food  produce little or no effect when they are not digested by the stomach,  or if the digested food is not absorbed by the lymphatic vessels, and  not assimilated by the various parts of the body. Now, the normal  functions of the digestive organs not only depend upon the composition  of the food, but also on its volume. The volume or bulk of the food  contributes to the healthy action of the digestive organs, by exercising  a stimulating effect upon the nerves which govern them. Thus the whole  organization of ruminating animals necessitates the supply of bulky  food, to keep the animal in good condition.    Feed sweet and nutritious food, therefore, frequently, regularly, and in  small quantities, and change it often, and the best results may be  confidently anticipated. If the cows are not in milk, but are to come in  in the spring, the difference in feeding should be rather in the  quantity than the quality, if the highest yield is to be expected from  them during the coming season.    The most common feeding is hay alone, and oftentimes very poor hay at  that. The main point is to keep the animal in a healthy and thriving  condition, and not to suffer her to fail in flesh; and with this object,  some change and variety of food are highly important.    [Illustration: CALLING IN THE CATTLE.]    Toward the close of winter, a herd of cows will begin to come in, or  approach their time of calving. Care should then be taken not to feed  too rich or stimulating food for the last week or two before this event,  as it is often attended with ill consequences. A plenty of hay, a few  potatoes or shorts, and pure water will suffice.    In spring, the best feeding for dairy cows will be much the same as that  for winter; the roots in store over winter, such as carrots, mangold  wurtzel, turnips, and parsnips, furnishing very valuable aid in  increasing the quantity and improving the quality of milk. Toward the  close of this season, and before the grass of pastures is sufficiently  grown to make it judicious to turn out the cows, the best dairymen  provide a supply of green fodder in the shape of winter rye, which, if  cut while it is tender and succulent, and before it is half grown, will  be greatly relished. Unless cut young, however, its stalk soon becomes  hard and unpalatable.    All practical dairymen agree in saying that a warm and well-ventilated  barn is indispensable to the promotion of the highest yield of milk in  winter; and most agree that cows in milk should not be turned out, even  to drink, in cold weather; all exposure to cold tending to lessen the  yield of milk.    In the London dairies, in which, of course, the cows are fed so as to  produce the largest flow of milk, the treatment is as follows: The cows  are kept at night in stalls. About three A. M. each has a half-bushel of  grains. When milking is finished, each receives a bushel of turnips (or  mangolds), and shortly afterward, one tenth of a truss of hay of the  best quality. This feeding occurs before eight A. M., when the animals  are turned into the yard. Four hours after, they are again tied up in  their stalls, and have another feed of grains. When the afternoon  milking is over (about three P. M.), they are fed with a bushel of  turnips, and after the lapse of an hour, hay is given them as before.  This mode of feeding usually continues throughout the cool season, or  from November to March. During the remaining months they are fed with  grains, tares, and cabbages, and a proportion of rowen, or second-cut  hay. They are supplied regularly until they are turned out to grass,  when they pass the whole of the night in the field.

With such motor scheme, we begin to understand the  selective process in attention. An impression may be accompanied by  other stimuli and associations, by thoughts and ideas, and thousands of  sensory excitements may thus arise in the cortex, but only those have a  chance for full vividness of development which cooeperate in the motor  action already started. Those impressions which would lead to the  opposite actions have no chance because their motor paths are blocked  and their own full development is dependent upon their possibility of  expression. To close the path means to inhibit the idea which demands  such action. We can attend to a hundred thoughts together, if they all  lead to the same attitude and deed. We can look at the opera, can see  every singer and every singer's gown, can listen to every word, can have  the whole plot in mind, can hear the thousands of tones which come from  the orchestra; and yet combine all that in one act of attention, because  it all belongs to the same setting of our reactive apparatus. Whatever  the one wants is wanted by the others. But if at the same time our  neighbor speaks to us, we do not notice it; his words work as a stimulus  which demands an entirely different motor setting as answer. Therefore  the words remain unvivid and unnoticed.    To attend means therefore to bring about a motor setting by which the  object of attention finds open channels for discharge in action. Which  particular action is needed in the state of attention cannot be  doubtful. Attention demands those motor responses and those inner steps  by which the object of attention shows itself more fully and more  clearly. When we give attention to the picture we want to see more  details, when we give attention to the problem we want to recognize more  of the factors involved, when we give attention to the banquet we want  to grasp more of the pleasurable features. This aim of attention  involves that, as part of such reactions, the sense organs become  adjusted; we fixate the eyeball, we listen, and in consequence the  object itself becomes clearer, and through the easy passage into the  motor channels the whole impression becomes vivid. At the same time, all  those associations must be reenforced and become vivid too which lead to  the same action. On the other hand, the opening of the one passageway  closes the path to the opposite action and inhibits the impressions  which would interfere with our interest. Every act of attention becomes,  therefore, a complex distribution in the reenforcement and inhibition of  mental states.    Now let us come back to suggestion. It shares, we said, with attention,  the power to reenforce and to inhibit. But if we examine what is  involved in the suggestion of an idea, we find surely more than a mere  turning of the attention towards one idea and turning the attention away  from another idea. That which characterizes and constitutes suggestion  is a belief in the idea, an acceptance of the idea as real and the  dismissal of the opposite idea as unreal. Yes, we may say directly that  it is meaningless to speak of suggesting an idea; we suggest either an  action or, if no action is concerned, we suggest belief in an idea. If I  suggest to the fearful man at twilight that the willow-tree trunk by the  wayside is a man with a gun, I do not turn his attention to an abstract  idea of a robber nor do I simply awaken the visual impression of one,  but I make him believe that such an idea is there realized, that he  really sees the person. If I suggest to him that he hears distant bells  ringing or that he feels a slight headache, he may not be suggestible  enough to accept it, but if he accepts it he is not simply attending to  the idea which I propose but he is convinced of its real existence. The  same holds true with the negative; if I suggest to him that the slight  headache of which he complained has disappeared or that the smell which  he noticed has stopped, I do not simply invite him to think of the  absence of such sensations. It becomes for him a suggestion only if he  becomes convinced that these disturbances have now become unreal. The  same holds true for all those suggestions of ideas which belong to our  practical life, the suggestions which art imprints on our minds, or  which politics and religion impart. As long as we are under the  suggestion of the novelist, we really believe in the existence of the  heroine; we really believe in the validity of the political party  principle; it is not an argument to which we simply give our attention,  it becomes a suggestion only when the belief in its objective existence  controls our minds. We may say in general that suggestions which are not  suggestions of actions are without exception suggestions of belief.  Actions and beliefs are the only possible material of any suggestion.    Yet what else is a belief than a preparation for action? I may think of  an object without preparing myself for any particular line of behavior.  Here in the room I may think of rain or sunshine on the street as a mere  idea, but to know that it now really rains or shines means something  entirely different. It means a completely new setting in my present  attitude, a setting by which I am prepared to act along the one or the  other line, to take an umbrella or to take a straw hat, when I am to  leave the house. I may think of the door of this room as locked or  unlocked without transcending the mere sphere of imagination, but to  believe that it is the one or the other means a new setting in my motor  adjustments. If it is locked I know that I cannot leave the room without  a key. Every belief means the preparation for a definite line of action  and a new motor adjustment in the whole system of motor paths, an  adjustment by which my actions in future will be switched off at once  into particular paths. And there is theoretically no difference whether  my belief refers to the proposition that the door is locked or that a  God exists in Heaven.    But if every belief is such a new motor setting, then we are evidently  brought back to the mechanism which was essential for every suggestion  of action on the one side and for every process of attention on the  other side, namely, the mechanism of antagonistic movements. To prepare  ourselves for one line of action means to close beforehand the channels  of discharge for the opposite. The suggestible mind sees the man with a  gun on the wayside because he is preparing himself in his expectation  for the appropriate action; he is ready for the fight or ready to run  away, and every line of the tree trunk is apperceived with reference to  this motor setting. The smell, on the other hand, has disappeared under  the influence of the suggestion because a new motor adjustment has set  in, in which he is prepared to act as if there were no smell.    The difference between suggestion and attention lies thus only in this:  the motor response in attention aims towards a fuller clearness of the  idea, for instance, by fixating, listening, observing, searching; while  the motor response in suggestion aims towards the practical action in  which the object of the idea is accepted as real. In attention, we  change the object in making it clearer; in suggestion, we change  ourselves in adapting ourselves to the new situation in which we  believe. If you consider attention as a psychophysical process open to  physiological explanation, you have surely no reason to seek anything  mysterious in the process of suggestion; and no new principle is  involved, if we come from the effect of the smallest suggestive hint to  the complex and powerful suggestions which overwhelm the whole  personality.    The two great types of suggestion, the suggestion of actions and the  suggestion of ideas, have now come nearer together since we have seen  that the suggestion of ideas is really a suggestion of the practical  acceptance of ideas, and that means, of a preparation towards a certain  line of action. In the one case I suggest the idea of a certain action  and this motor idea leads to the action itself, and in the other case I  suggest a certain preparatory setting for action and that will lead to  the appropriate action whenever the time for action comes. Every  suggestion is thus ultimately a suggestion of activity. The most  effective suggestion for an action results, of course, if both methods  are combined, that is, if we suggest not only the will to perform the  action, but at the same time the belief that the end of the action will  be real. Suggestion reaches us usually from without. Yet there is again  no new principle involved, when the new motor setting results from one's  own associations and emotions. Then we speak of auto-suggestion. It is  the same difference which exists between the attention called forth  through an outer impression and the attention directed by our own will.  Loud noise demands our attention, and even a whispered word may awaken  associations which stir up the attention. In both cases the channels for  adjustment become opened without our intention. But if we are expecting  something of importance, if we start to watch a certain development and  to find something which we seek, we open the channels by our own effort  beforehand and produce our own settings thus through a voluntary  attention. In this way suggestion too may start from without,--by a  spoken word, by a movement, by a hint; or may start within us and may  give us our caprices and our prejudices.    We must not neglect one other feature of the suggestion. Not every  proposition to action or to belief can be called a suggestion. Essential  too remains the other side of it, the overcoming of the resistance. A  mere request, \"Please hand me the book on the table,\" or a mere  communication, \"It rains,\" may "]]]
