When Thor and Loki stepped across the threshold Thrym went to welcome  them. He wanted to raise the veil of his bride and give her a kiss. Loki  quickly laid his hand on the Giant's shoulder.    \"Forbear,\" he whispered. \"Do not raise her veil. We Dwellers in Asgard  are reserved and bashful. Freya would be much offended to be kissed  before this company.\"    \"Aye, aye,\" said Thrym's old mother. \"Do not raise thy bride's veil,  son. These Dwellers in Asgard are more refined in their ways than we,  the Giants.\" Then the old woman took Thor by the hand and led him to the  table.    The size and the girth of the bride did not surprise the huge Giants who  were in the wedding company. They stared at Thor and Loki, but they  could see nothing of their faces and little of their forms because of  their veils.    Thor sat at the table with Thrym on one side of him and Loki on the  other. Then the feast began. Thor, not noticing that what he did was  unbecoming to a refined maiden, ate eight salmon right away. Loki nudged  him and pressed his foot, but he did not heed Loki. After the salmon he  ate a whole ox.    \"These maids of Asgard,\" said the Giants to each other, \"they may be  refined, as Thrym's mother says, but their appetites are lusty enough.\"    \"No wonder she eats, poor thing,\" said Loki to Thrym. \"It is eight days  since we left Asgard. And Freya never ate upon the way, so anxious was  she to see Thrym and to come to his house.\"    \"Poor darling, poor darling,\" said the Giant. \"What she has eaten is  little after all.\"    Thor nodded his head toward the mead vat. Thrym ordered his servants to  bring a measure to his bride. The servants were kept coming with  measures to Thor. While the Giants watched, and while Loki nudged and  nodded, he drank three barrels of mead.    \"Oh,\" said the Giants to Thrym's mother, \"we are not so sorry that we  failed to win a bride from Asgard.\"    And now a piece of the veil slipped aside and Thor's eyes were seen for  an instant. \"Oh, how does it come that Freya has such glaring eyes?\"  said Thrym.    \"Poor thing, poor thing,\" said Loki, \"no wonder her eyes are glaring and  staring. She has not slept for eight nights, so anxious was she to come  to you and to your house, Thrym. But now the time has come for you to  join hands with your bride. First, put into her hands the hammer Mioelnir  that she may know the great recompense that the Giants have given for  her coming.\"    Then Thrym, the stupidest of the Giants, rose up and brought Mioelnir,  the defence of Asgard, into the feasting hall. Thor could hardly  restrain himself from springing up and seizing it from the Giant. But  Loki was able to keep him still. Thrym brought over the hammer and put  the handle into the hands of her whom he thought was his bride. Thor's  hands closed on his hammer. Instantly he stood up. The veil fell off  him. His countenance and his blazing eyes were seen by all. He struck  one blow on the wall of the house. Down it crashed. Then Thor went  striding out of the ruin with Loki beside him, while within the Giants  bellowed as the roof and walls fell down on them. And so was Mioelnir,  the defence of Asgard, lost and won back.          [Illustration]    AEGIR'S FEAST: HOW THOR TRIUMPHED      The time between midday and evening wore on while the AEsir and the Vanir  gathered for the feast in old AEgir's hall listened to the stories that  Loki told in mockery of Thor. The night came, but no banquet was made  ready for the Dwellers in Asgard. They called to AEgir's two  underservants, Fimaffenger and Elder, and they bade them bring them a  supper. Slight was what they got, but they went to bed saying, \"Great  must be the preparations that old AEgir is making to feast us tomorrow.\"    The morrow came and the midday of the morrow, and still the Dwellers in  Asgard saw no preparations being made for the banquet. Then Frey rose up  and went to seek old AEgir, the Giant King of the Sea. He found him  sitting with bowed head in his inner hall. \"Ho, AEgir,\" he said, \"what of  the banquet that you have offered to the Dwellers in Asgard?\"    Old AEgir mumbled and pulled at his beard. At last he looked his guest in  the face and told why the banquet was not being made ready. The mead for  the feast was not yet brewed. And there was little chance of being able  to brew mead that would do for all, for AEgir's hall was lacking a mead  kettle that would contain enough.    When the AEsir and the Vanir heard this they were sorely disappointed.  Who now, outside of Asgard, would give them a feast? AEgir was the only  one of the Giants who was friendly to them, and AEgir could not give them  full entertainment.    Then a Giant youth who was there spoke up and said, \"My kinsman, the  Giant Hrymer, has a mead kettle that is a mile wide. If we could bring  Hrymer's kettle here, what a feast we might have!\"    \"One of us can go for that kettle,\" Frey said.    \"Ah, but Hrymer's dwelling is beyond the deepest forest and behind the  highest mountain,\" the Giant youth said, \"and Hrymer himself is a rough  and a churlish one to call on.\"    \"Still, one of us should go,\" Frey said.    \"I will go to Hrymer's dwelling,\" said Thor, standing up. \"I will go to  Hrymer's dwelling and get the mile-wide kettle from him by force or  cunning.\" He had been sitting subdued under the mocking tales that Loki  told of him and he was pleased with this chance to make his prowess  plain to the AEsir and the Vanir. He buckled on the belt that doubled his  strength. He drew on the iron gloves that enabled him to grasp Mioelnir.  He took his hammer in his hands, and he signed to the Giant youth to  come with him and be his guide.    The AEsir and the Vanir applauded Thor as he stepped out of old AEgir's  hall. But Loki, mischievous Loki, threw a gibe after him. \"Do not let  the hammer out of your hands this time, bride of Thrym,\" he shouted.    Thor, with the Giant youth to guide him, went through the deepest forest  and over the highest mountain. He came at last to the Giant's dwelling.  On a hillock before Hrymer's house was a dreadful warden; a Giant crone  she was, with heads a-many growing out of her shoulders. She was  squatting down on her ankles, and her heads, growing in bunches, were  looking in different directions. As Thor and the Giant youth came near  screams and yelps came from all her heads. Thor grasped his hammer and  would have flung it at her if a Giant woman, making a sign of peace, had  not come to the door of the dwelling. The youthful Giant who was with  Thor greeted her as his mother.    \"Son, come within,\" said she, \"and you may bring your fellow farer with  you.\"    The Giant crone--she was Hrymer's grandmother--kept up her screaming and  yelping. But Thor went past her and into the Giant's dwelling.    When she saw that it was one of the Dwellers in Asgard who had come with  her son the Giant woman grew fearful for them both. \"Hrymer,\" she said,  \"will be in a rage to find one of the AEsir under his roof. He will  strive to slay you.\"    \"It is not likely he will succeed,\" Thor said, grasping Mioelnir, the  hammer that all the Giant race knew of and dreaded.    \"Hide from him,\" said the Giant woman. \"He may injure my son in his rage  to find you here.\"    \"I am not wont to hide from the Giants,\" Thor said.    \"Hide only for a little while! Hide until Hrymer has eaten,\" the Giant  woman pleaded. \"He comes back from the chase in a stormy temper. After  he has eaten he is easier to deal with. Hide until he has finished  supper.\"    Thor at last agreed to do this. He and the Giant youth hid behind a  pillar in the hall. They were barely hidden when they heard the clatter  of the Giant's steps as he came through the courtyard. He came to the  door. His beard was like a frozen forest around his mouth. And he  dragged along with him a wild bull that he had captured in the chase. So  proud was he of his capture that he dragged it into the hall.    \"I have taken alive,\" he shouted, \"the bull with the mightiest head and  horns. 'Heaven-breaking' this bull is called. No Giant but me could  capture it.\" He tied the bull to the post of the door and then his eyes  went toward the pillar behind which Thor and the Giant youth were  hiding. The pillar split up its whole length at that look from Hrymer's  eyes. He came nearer. The pillar of stone broke across. It fell with the  crossbeam it supported and all the kettles and cauldrons that were  hanging on the beam came down with a terrible rattle.    Then Thor stepped out and faced the wrathful Giant. \"It is I who am  here, friend Hrymer,\" he said, his hands resting on his hammer.    Then Hrymer, who knew Thor and knew the force of Thor's hammer, drew  back. \"Now that you are in my house, Asa Thor,\" he said, \"I will not  quarrel with you. Make supper ready for Asa Thor and your son and  myself,\" said he to the Giant woman.    A plentiful supper was spread and Hrymer and Thor and the Giant youth  sat down to three whole roast oxen. Thor ate the whole of one ox.  Hrymer, who had eaten nearly two himself, leaving only small cuts for  his wife and his youthful kinsman, grumbled at Thor's appetite. \"You'll  clear my fields, Asa Thor,\" he said, \"if you stay long with me.\"    \"Do not grumble, Hrymer,\" Thor said. \"Tomorrow I'll go fishing and I'll  bring you back the weight of what I ate.\"    \"Then instead of hunting I'll go fishing with you tomorrow, Asa Thor,\"  said Hrymer. \"And don't be frightened if I take you out on a rough sea.\"    Hrymer was first out of bed the next morning. He came with the pole and  the ropes in his hand to where Thor was sleeping. \"Time to start earning  your meal, Asa Thor,\" said he.    Thor got out of bed, and when they were both in the courtyard the Giant  said, \"You'll have to provide a bait for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24750"],[0,"Mizora: A Prophecy (#17)"],[1,"themselves in and out  in a tangled mass of gorgeous beauty. Suddenly the beads of color fell  in a shower of gems, topaz and emerald, ruby and sapphire, amethyst and  pearly crystals of dew. I looked upward, where the rays of variegated  colors were sweeping the zenith, and high above the first crown was a  second more vivid still. Myriads of rainbows, the colors broad and  intense, fluttered from its base, the whole outlined by a halo of fire.  It rolled together in a huge scroll, and, in an instant, fell apart a  shower of flakes, minute as snow, but of all the gorgeous, dazzling hues  of earth and sky combined. They disappeared in the mystery of space to  instantly form into a fluttering, waving banner of delicate green mist  and--vanish; only to repeat itself.    The display of the Aurora Borealis was always an exhibition of  astonishing rapidity of motion of intense colors. The most glorious  sunset--where the vapory billows of the sky have caught the bloom of the  dying Autumn--cannot rival it. All the precious gems of earth appear to  have dissolved into mist, to join in a wild and aerial dance. The people  of Mizora attributed it entirely to electricity.    Although the sun never rose or set in Mizora, yet for six months in a  year, that country had the heart of a voluptuous summer. It beat with a  strong, warm pulse of life through all nature. The orchards budded and  bloomed, and mellowed into perfect fruition their luscious globes. The  fields laughed in the warm, rich light, and smiled on the harvest. I  could feel my own blood bound as with a new lease of life at the first  breath of spring.    The winters of Mizora had clouds and rain and sleet and snow, and  sometimes, especially near the circular sea, the fury of an Arctic snow  storm; but so well prepared were they that it became an amusement.  Looking into the chaos of snow flakes, driven hither and thither by  fierce winds, the pedestrians in the street presented no painful  contrast to the luxury of your own room, with its balmy breath and  cheerful flowers. You saw none but what were thoroughly clad, and you  knew that they were hurrying to homes that were bright and attractive,  if not as elegant as yours; where loving welcomes were sure to greet  them and happiness would sit with them at the feast; for the heart that  is pure has always a kingly guest for its company.    A wonderful discovery that the people of Mizora had made was the power  to annihilate space as an impediment to conversation. They claimed that  the atmosphere had regular currents of electricity that were accurately  known to them. They talked to them by means of simply constructed  instruments, and the voice would be as audible and as easily recognized  at three thousand miles distant as at only three feet. Stations were  built similar to our telegraph offices, but on high elevations. I  understood that they could not be used upon the surface. Every private  and public house, however, had communication with the general office,  and could converse with friends at a distance whenever desirable. Public  speakers made constant use of it, but in connection with another  extraordinary apparatus which I regret my inability to perfectly  describe.    I saw it first from the dress circle of a theater. It occupied the whole  rear of the stage, and from where I sat, looked like a solid wall of  polished metal. But it had a wonderful function, for immediately in  front of it, moving, speaking and gesturing, was the figure of a popular  public lecturer, so life-like in appearance that I could scarcely be  convinced that it was only a reflection. Yet such it was, and the  original was addressing an audience in person more than a thousand miles  distant.    It was no common thing for a lecturer to address a dozen or more  audiences at the same time, scattered over an area of thousands of  miles, and every one listening to and observing what appeared to be the  real speaker. In fact, public speakers in Mizora never traveled on pure  professional business. It was not necessary. They prepared a room in  their own dwelling with the needful apparatus, and at the time specified  delivered a lecture in twenty different cities.    I was so interested in this very remarkable invention that I made  vigorous mental exertions to comprehend it sufficiently to explain its  mechanism and philosophical principles intelligently; but I can only say  that it was one of the wonders those people produced with electricity.  The mechanism was simple, but the science of its construction and  workings I could not comprehend. The grasp of my mind was not broad  enough. The instrument that transmitted the voice was entirely separate.    I must not neglect to mention that all kinds of public entertainments,  such as operas, concerts and dramas, could be and were repeated to  audiences at a distance from where the real transaction was taking  place. I attended a number of operas that were only the reflex of others  that were being presented to audiences far distant.    These repetitions were always marvels of accuracy of vividness.    Small reflecting apparatus were to be found in every dwelling and  business house. It is hardly necessary to state that letter-writing was  an unknown accomplishment in Mizora. The person who desired to converse  with another, no matter how far distant, placed herself in communication  with her two instruments and signaled. Her friend appeared upon the  polished metal surface like the figure in a mirror, and spoke to her  audibly, and looked at her with all the naturalness of reality.    I have frequently witnessed such interviews between Wauna and her  mother, when we were visiting distant cities. It was certainly a more  satisfactory way of communicating than by letter. The small apparatus  used by private families and business houses were not like those used in  public halls and theaters. In the former, the reflection was exactly  similar to the image of a mirror; in the latter, the figure was  projected upon the stage. It required more complicated machinery to  produce, and was not practicable for small families or business houses.  I now learned that on my arrival in Mizora I had been taken to one of  the largest apparatus and put in communication with it. I was informed  by Wauna that I had been exhibited to every college and school in the  country by reflex representation. She said that she and her mother had  seen me distinctly and heard my voice. The latter had been so  uncongenial in accent and tone that she had hesitated about becoming my  instructor on that account. It was my evident appreciation of my  deficiencies as compared to them that had enlisted her sympathy.    Now, in my own country, my voice had attracted attention by its  smoothness and modulation, and I was greatly surprised to hear Wauna  speak of its unmusical tone as really annoying. But then in Mizora there  are no voices but what are sweet enough to charm the birds.    In the journeys that Wauna and I took during the college vacation, we  were constantly meeting strangers, but they never appeared the least  surprised at my dark hair and eyes, which were such a contrast to all  the other hair and eyes to be met with in Mizora, that I greatly  wondered at it until I learned of the power of the reflector. I  requested permission to examine one of the large ones used in a theater,  and it was granted me. Wauna accompanied me and signaled to a friend of  hers. As if by magic a form appeared and moved across the stage. It  bowed to me, smiled and motioned with its hand, to all appearances a  material body. I asked Wauna to approach it, which she did, and passed  her hand through it. There was nothing that resisted her touch, yet I  plainly saw the figure, and recognized it as the perfect representation  of a friend of Wauna's, an actress residing in a distant city. When I  ascended the stage, the figure vanished, and I understood that it could  be visible only at a certain distance from the reflector.    In traveling great distances, or even short ones where great speed was  desired, the Mizoraens used air ships; but only for the transportation  of passengers and the very lightest of freight. Heavy articles could not  be as conveniently carried by them as by railroads. Their railroads were  constructed and conducted on a system so perfect that accidents were  never known. Every engineer had an electric signal attached to the  engine, that could signal a train three miles distant.    The motive power for nearly all engines was compressed air. Electricity,  which was recognized by Mizora scientists as a force of great  intensity, was rarely used as a propelling power on railroads. Its use  was attended by possible danger, but compressed air was not. Electricity  produced the heat that supplied the air ships and railroads with that  very necessary comfort. In case there should be an accident, as a  collision, or thrown from the track, heat could not be a source of  danger when furnished by electricity. But I never heard of a railroad  accident during the whole fifteen years that I spent in Mizora.    Air-ships, however, were not exempt from danger, although the  precautions against it were ingenious and carefully observed. The Mizora  people could tell the approach of a storm, and the exact time it would  arrive. They had signal stations established for the purpose, all over  the country.    But, though they were skilled mechanics, and far in advance of my own  world, and the limits of my comprehension in their scientific  discoveries and appliances, they had not yet discovered the means of  subduing the elements, or driving unharmed through their fury. When  nature became convulsed with passion, they guarded themselves against  it, but did not endeavor to thwart it.    Their air-ships were covered, and furnished with luxurious seats. The  whole upper part of the car was composed of very thin glass. They"]]]
