So, to your pleasures;            I am for other than for _dancing measures_.    A similar play upon the word is in _Richard II._ III, iv, 6, where the  queen asks her ladies to propose some sport to drive away care.         _1 Lady._ Madam, we'll dance.         _Queen._ My legs can keep no _measure_ in delight,            When my poor heart no _measure_ keeps in grief:            Therefore, no dancing, girl.    See especially the following, which holds a whole string of quibbles.    _L.L.L._ V, ii, 184. Masked ball.         _King of Navarre._ Say to her, we have _measur'd_ many miles,            To tread a _measure_ with her on this grass.         _Boyet_ (to the ladies). They say, that they have _measur'd_ many            a mile,            To tread a _measure_ with you on this grass.         _Rosaline._ It is not so. Ask them how many inches            Is in one mile: if they have _measur'd_ many,            The _measure_ then of one is easily told.         _Boyet._ If, to come hither, you have _measur'd_ miles,            And many miles, the princess bids you tell,            How many inches do fill up one mile.         _Biron._ Tell her, we _measure_ them by weary _steps_.    And l. 209, _measure_.    Another dance that is frequently referred to is the Dump, the slow and  mournful character of which has already been explained in the notes on  _Lucrece_ 1127. As a serenade it is named in the _Two Gent._ III, ii,  83. The nature of the steps of this dance is not certainly known. Two  features, however, may be guessed at--viz., a tapping of the foot at  certain places, which may be inferred from the possible connection of  the word with 'Thump'; and secondly, an alternation of a slow sliding  step, interspersed with dead pauses, and a quicker movement, succeeded  again by the slow step. These last seem to be indicated by the music  of 'My Lady Carey's Dump,' part of which is given in the Appendix. The  character of the Dump has given us the modern expression of 'in the  dumps'--_i.e._, sulky; and this is also used commonly in Shakespeare.    In the next passage, Peter, Capulet's servant, speaks ironically of a  'merry' dump, and quotes verse 1 of Richard Edwards' song, 'When  griping grief.' For an account of that song see Section III., about  Songs and Singing. In Peter's quotation, the dumps are 'doleful.'    The quibbles on 'silver sound,' 'sweet sound,' 'sound for silver,' 'no  _gold_ for sounding,' are further examples of Shakespeare's fondness  for joking on musical matters. Peter's reply to the Third Musician,  'You are the singer; I will _say_ for you,' may be a just reflection  on Mr James Soundpost's lack of words, or perhaps indicates that the  pronunciation of singers even in that musical age was no better than  it is now.    The improvised names of the musicians are pointed enough; Simon  'Catling,' referring to the material of his viol strings; Hugh  'Rebeck,' the rebeck being the ancient English fiddle with three  strings. The 'smale' Ribible, which Absolon, the parish clerk in  Chaucer, used to play 'songes' on, is supposed to be the same  instrument; and finally, James 'Soundpost,' which wants no explaining.    The final remark of Musician 2 is delicious, 'tarry for the mourners,  and stay dinner.'    _Rom._ IV, v, 96. After Juliet's apparent death.         _Exeunt Capulet, Lady C., Paris, etc._         _1 Musician._ 'Faith, we may _put up our pipes_, and be gone.         _Nurse._ Honest good fellows, ah! _put up, put up_;            For well you know, this is a pitiful _case_.         _1 Mus._ Ay, by my troth, the _case_ may be amended.    (See _H. 5._ III, ii, 42, about Bardolph and the lute case.)         _Enter Peter._         _Peter._ Musicians, O, musicians! \"Heart's ease, Heart's       ease\": O! an you will have me live, play \"Heart's ease.\"         _1 Mus._ Why \"Heart's ease?\"         _Peter._ O, musicians, because my _heart itself_ plays--\"My       heart is full of woe.\" O! play me some _merry dump_, to       comfort me.         _2 Mus._ Not a _dump_ we: 'tis no time to play now.           *       *       *       *       *         _Peter._ Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on       your pate. I will carry no _crotchets_: I'll _re_ you, I'll       _fa_ you. Do you _note_ me?         _1. Mus._ An you _re_ us, and _fa_ us, you _note_ US.         _2. Mus._ Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your       wit.         _Peter._ Then have at you with my wit.... Answer me like       men:              _When griping grief the heart doth wound,            And_ DOLEFUL DUMPS _the mind oppress,            Then music with her silver sound--_         Why \"silver sound\"? why \"music with her _silver_ sound\"?       what say you, Simon _Catling_?         _1 Mus._ Marry, sir, because silver hath a _sweet sound_.         _Peter._ Pretty!--what say _you_, Hugh _Rebeck_?         _2 Mus._ I say--\"silver sound\" because musicians _sound for       silver_.         _Peter._ Pretty too!--what say _you_, James _Soundpost_?         _3 Mus._ 'Faith, I know not what to _say_.         _Peter._ O! I cry you mercy; you are the _singer_: I will       _say_ for you. It is--\"music with her silver sound,\" because       musicians have no _gold_ for  sounding:--              Then music with her _silver sound_            With speedy help doth lend redress.         [_Exit._         _1 Mus._ What a pestilent knave is this same!         _2 Mus._ Hang him, Jack! [Peter's names evidently all       wrong.] Come, we'll in here; tarry for the mourners, _and       stay dinner_.         [_Exeunt._]    The Hay, Hey, or Raye, seems to be mentioned only once--viz., in  _Love's Labour's Lost_, in the account of the preparations for the  Pageant of the Worthies. Constable Dull proposes to accompany the  dancing of the hay with a tabor, which may be taken as the common  practice. Holofernes says Dull's idea is 'most dull,' like himself.  The Hay was a Round country-dance--_i.e._, the performers stood in a  circle to begin with, and then (in the words of an old direction  quoted in Stainer and Barrett's Dict.) 'wind round _handing_ in  passing until you come to your places.' See the note on Arbeau's  Orchesographie for the steps and tune of the Haye.    Hawkins says (Hist. 705) that in an old comedy called the Rehearsal,  the Earth, the Sun, and Moon are made to dance the Hey to the tune of  Trenchmore, which is referred to in the above-quoted passage from  Selden, as a lively and even boisterous dance.    _L.L.L._ V, i, 148. Schoolmaster Holofernes & Co. arranging the  Pageant of the Nine Worthies.         _Dull._ I'll make one in a _dance_, or so; or I will _play_            _On the tabor_ to the Worthies, and let them _dance the hay_.         _Hol._ _Most dull_, honest Dull.    The Morrice Dance, or Morris, was very popular in England and other  countries in the 16th century.    Relics of it may still be seen in country places at certain times of  the year. The very meagre celebrations of May Day, which can be seen  in London even now, are a survival of the ancient customs with which  the Morrice-Dance was always associated. Hawkins gives this account of  the Morris; \"there are few country places in this kingdom where it is  not known; it is a dance of young men in their shirts, with bells at  their feet, and ribbons of various colours tied round their arms, and  slung across their shoulders. Some writers, Shakespeare in particular,  mention a Hobby-horse and a Maid Marian, as necessary in this  recreation. Sir William Temple speaks of a pamphlet in the library of  the Earl of Leicester, which gave an account of a set of  morrice-dancers in King James's reign, composed of ten men or twelve  men, for the ambiguity of his expression renders it impossible to say  which of the two numbers is meant, who went about the country: that  they danced a Maid Marian, with a tabor and pipe, and that their ages  one with another made up twelve hundred years.\"    [Temple's own words are quite clear--viz., that there were _ten_ men  who danced; a Maid Marian (makes eleven); and a man to play the tabor  and pipe (makes twelve).]    The name Morrice means Moorish dance, or Morisco. Perhaps it was  called so from being accompanied by the tabor, for Drums of all sorts  are distinctly Eastern instruments.    Two tunes, one a Moresca by Monteverde, 1608, and the other an English  Morris, 1650, are given in the Appendix. Also see Note on  'Orchesographie' for a Morisque.    The first of the two following passages connects the morris with May  Day; the second with Whitsuntide, which is in May as often as not.    _All's Well_ II, ii, 20.         _Countess._ Will your answer serve fit to all questions?         _Clown._ As fit as ... a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a       _morris_ for _May-day_....    _H. 5._ II, iv, 23.         _Dauphin._ And let us do it with no show of fear;            No, with no more, than if we heard that England            Were busied with a _Whitsun morris-dance_;    The Pavan has been mentioned before, as the dance in Duple time which  preceded the Galliard which was in a triple rhythm. It was a stately  dance, with a stately name, for the derivation is most probably from  _Pavo_, a peacock, with a reference, no doubt, to the majestic strut  and gay feathers of that bird. It was _de rigueur_ for gentlemen to  dance the Pavan in cap and sword; for lawyers to wear their gowns,  princes their mantles; and ladies to take part in the fullest of full  dress, the long trains of their gowns being supposed to correspond in  appearance and movement to the peacock's tail.    The only Pavan mentioned by Shakespeare is the _Passy-measures pavin_,  otherwise known as Passing-measures-pavin, or Passameso, or _Pass e  mezzo_, which last is the earliest form of the word.    Praetorius (_b._ 1571), however, says the Passe mezzo is so called  because it has only _half as many steps_ as a Galliard. Thus"]]]
