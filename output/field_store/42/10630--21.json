Farrant may have been able to open his playhouse before the close of  the year; or he may have first begun performances there in the early  months of 1577. He would certainly be anxious to make use of the new  play he was preparing for presentation at Court on Twelfth Day,  January 6, 1577.    For four years, 1576-1580, the playhouse was operated without trouble.  Sir William More, however, was not pleased at the success with which  the actors were meeting. He asserted that when he made the lease he  was given to understand that the building was to be used \"only for the  teaching of the Children of the Chapel\"--with, no doubt, a few  rehearsals to which certain persons would be _privately_ invited. But,  now, to his grief, he discovered that Farrant had \"made it a continual  house for plays.\" He asserted that the playhouse had become offensive  to the precinct; and doubtless some complaints had been made to him,  as landlord, by the more aristocratic inhabitants.[156] At any rate,  he became anxious to regain possession of the building.    [Footnote 156: I suspect that the theatre gave greater offense to More  himself than it did to any one else, for it adjoined his home, and the  audience made use of the private passage which led from Water Lane to  his mansion. Unquestionably he suffered worse than any one else both  from the noise and the crowds.]    In the autumn of 1580 he saw an opportunity to break the lease and  close the playhouse. Farrant made the mistake of letting \"two parcels  thereof to two severall persons\" without first gaining the written  consent of More, and at once More \"charged him with forfeiture of his  lease.\" But before More could \"take remedy against him\" Farrant died,  November 30, 1580. More, however, \"entered upon the house, and refused  to receive any rent but conditionally.\"    By his will, proved March 1, 1581, Farrant left the lease of the  Blackfriars to his widow, Anne Farrant. But she had no authority over  the royal choristers, nor was she qualified to manage a company of  actors, even if she had had the time to do so after caring for her  \"ten little ones.\" What use, if any, was made of the playhouse during  the succeeding winter we do not know. The widow writes that she,  \"being a sole woman, unable of herself to use the said rooms to such  purpose as her said husband late used them, nor having any need or  occasion to occupy them to such commodity as would discharge the rents  due for the said rooms in the bill alledged, nor being able to  sustain, repair, and amend the said rooms,\" etc.;[157] the natural  inference from which is that for a time the playhouse stood unused.  The widow, of course, was anxious to sublet the building to some one  who could make use of it as a playhouse; and on December 25, 1580, she  addressed a letter to Sir William More asking his written permission  to make such a disposal of the lease. The letter has a pathetic  interest that justifies its insertion here:         _To the right worshipful Sir William More, Knight, at his       house near Guilford, give these with speed._         _Right worshipful Sir:_         After my humble commendations, and my duty also       remembered--where it hath pleased your worship to grant unto       my husband in his life time one lease of your house within       the Blackfriars, for the term of twenty-one years, with a       proviso in the end thereof that he cannot neither let nor       set the same without your worship's consent under your hand       in writing. And now for that it hath pleased God to call my       said husband unto His mercy, having left behind him the       charge of ten small children upon my hand, and my husband       besides greatly indebted, not having the revenue of one       groat any way coming in, but by making the best I may of       such things as he hath left behind him, to relieve my little       ones. May it therefore please your worship, of your abundant       clemency and accustomed goodness, to consider a poor widow's       distressed estate, and for God's cause to comfort her with       your worship's warrant under your hand to let and set the       same to my best comodity during the term of years in the       said lease contained, not doing any waste. In all which       doing, I shall evermore most abundantly pray unto God for       the preservation of your worship's long continuance. From       Grenwich, the twenty-fifth of December,         By a poor and sorrowful widow,         ANNE FARRANT.[158]    [Footnote 157: Wallace, _The Evolution of the English Drama_, p. 163.]    [Footnote 158: Wallace, _The Evolution of the English Drama_, p.  153.]    Whether she secured in writing the permission she requested we do not  know. Four years later More said that she did not. Possibly, however,  she was orally given to understand that she might transfer the lease  to her husband's former partner in the enterprise, William  Hunnis.[159] Hunnis naturally was eager to make use of the building in  preparation for the Christmas plays at Court. At some date before  September 19, he secured the use of the playhouse on a temporary  agreement with the widow; but in order to avoid any difficulty with  More, he interviewed the latter, and presented a letter of  recommendation from the Earl of Leicester. This letter has been  preserved among Sir William's papers:         _Sir William More:_         Whereas my friend, Mr. Hunnis, this bearer, informeth me       that he hath of late bought of Farrant's widow her lease of       that house in Blackfriars which you made to her husband,       deceased, and means there to practice the Queen's Children       of the Chapel, being now in his charge, in like sort as his       predecessor did, for the better training them to do Her       Majesty's service; he is now a suitor to me to recommend him       to your good favour--which I do very heartily, as one that I       wish right well unto, and will give you thanks for any       continuance or friendship you shall show him for the       furtherance of this his honest request. And thus, with my       hearty commendations, I wish you right heartily well to       fare. From the Court, this nineteenth of September, 1581.         Your very friend,         R. LEICESTER.[160]    [Footnote 159: More had \"refused to accept any rent but  conditionally.\" Probably he refused written consent to the sublease  for the same reason.]    [Footnote 160: Wallace, _The Evolution of the English Drama_, p. 154.]    The result of this interview we do not know. But on December 20  following, the widow made a formal lease of the property to William  Hunnis and John Newman, at a rental of L20 13_s._ 4_d._ a year, an  increase of L6 13_s._ 4_d._ over the rental she had to pay More. She  required of them a bond of L100 to guarantee their performance of all  the covenants of the lease. Thereupon the theatre under Hunnis and  Newman resumed its career--if, indeed, this had ever been seriously  interrupted.    In the course of time, More's anxiety to recover possession of the  hall seems to have increased. The quarterly payments were not promptly  met by the widow, and the repairs on the building were not made to his  satisfaction. Probably through fear of the increasing dissatisfaction  on the part of More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their lease, in  1583, to a young Welsh scrivener, Henry Evans, who had become  interested in dramatic affairs. This transfer of the lease without  More's written consent was a second clear breach of the original  contract, and it gave More exactly the opportunity he sought.  Accordingly, he declared the original lease to Farrant void, and made  a new lease of the house \"unto his own man, Thomas Smallpiece, to try  the said Evans his right.\" But Evans, being a lawyer, knew how to take  care of himself. He \"demurred in law,\" and \"kept the same in his hands  with long delays.\"    The widow, alarmed at the prospect of losing her lease, brought suit,  in December, 1583, against Hunnis and Newman separately for the  forfeiture of their several bonds of L100, contending that they had  not paid promptly according to their agreement, and had not kept the  building in proper repair. Hunnis and Newman separately brought suit  in the Court of Requests for relief against the widow's suits.  Meanwhile More was demanding judgment against Evans. Hunnis, it seems,  carried his troubles to the Court and there sought help. Queen  Elizabeth could take no direct action, because Sir William More was a  good friend of hers, who had entertained her in his home. But she  might enlist the aid of one of her noblemen who were interested in the  drama. However this was, the young Earl of Oxford, himself a  playwright and the patron of a troupe of boy-actors, came to the  rescue of the theatre. He bought the lease of the building from Evans,  and undertook to reorganize its affairs. To Hunnis's twelve Children  of the Chapel he added the Children of St. Paul's Cathedral, making  thus a company of adequate size. He retained Hunnis, no doubt, as one  of the trainers of the Boys, and he kept Evans as manager of the  troupe. Moreover, shortly after the purchase, probably in June, 1583,  he made a free gift of the lease to his private secretary, John Lyly,  a young man who had recently won fame with the first English novel,  _Euphues_. The object of this, like the preceding transfers of title,  it seems, was to put as many legal blocks in the path of Sir William  More as possible. More realized this, and complained specifically that  \"the title was posted from one to another\"; yet he had firmly made up  his mind to recover the property, and in spite of Oxford's  interference, he instructed his \"learned council\" to \"demand  judgment.\"    Meanwhile the dramatic organization at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22409"],[0,"A Woman who went to Alaska (#17)"],[1,"they did.    There was also much trouble over real estate. Land was very high in  price. Some Swedes, who, the year before, had paid seven hundred dollars  for a town lot three hundred by fifty feet in size, now sold one-half of  it for ten thousand dollars. It is small wonder, then, where \"possession  is nine points of the law\" that men who rightfully claimed ground were  ready to fight to keep it, and those who were wrongfully in possession  many times stood guard with firearms.    In pitching our tents upon the sandy beach, especially after gaining  permission of the old captain who told us we would be in the street if  ever a street should be opened through on the Sandspit, but that was not  likely, and he had given us his full and free consent to our camping  temporarily there next his lots, we expected to have no trouble. Here we  miscalculated. Though the captain was kind and reasonable, he had a  partner who was just the reverse, and this person gave us infinite  trouble.    Scarcely had our first load of baggage been put upon the ground when he  began to tramp fussily about at all times of day and night. After our  stakes were driven he would come quietly in the night and pull them up,  so we would find our canvas flapping in the morning breeze when we  waked. Or, after we had retired for the night, he would come with some  other, stand within hearing distance, and threaten us if we did not move  away.    One morning, upon rising, we found that he had moved a long carpenter's  bench directly upon the spot next madam's tent, which I was trying to  reserve for my own tent as soon as I succeeded in getting my things from  the steamer. This disappointed me much, but I said nothing; and when my  tent finally came I pitched it on the other side, with my door directly  opposite hers and only six feet from her entrance.    As to appearance this old man was a jolly sight. He wore long and  tangled hair which had once been curly, but now hung in unkempt and  dirty shreds upon his shoulders, while his hat was an antiquated relic  of a former life in the States. A pair of old trousers generally hung by  one suspender over a colored shirt, which, the summer before, possibly,  had had a wash-tub experience, but not later; his footwear was  altogether unmentionable. He was called well-to-do, and there was no  necessity for him to cut such an abominable figure, so he soon became a  by-word, and was designated as \"sour dough.\" At all events, he was sour  enough, and kept up a continual siege of torment until he received a  temporary quietus.    We three women were sitting in the tent one morning when there came a  voice at the door. Going forward to enquire what was wanted, a man said  gruffly, thrusting a piece of paper into my hand.    \"A notice from the chief of police.\"    \"For what?\" I inquired.    \"For you, to vacate these premises without delay.\"    \"Indeed! Are they to open a street? Will the other campers about here  move also?\" I asked.    \"I don't know. My orders are that you shall move immediately. See that  you do it,\" said the man rudely.    While holding the paper in my hands I glanced over it hastily, and saw  the marks of a spurious document. It was poorly constructed, and bore  no official signs. I recognized it as a counterfeit.    \"We have had permission from captain S., one of the aldermen, to put our  tents here, and we shall stay unless he orders us away,\" said I stoutly.    \"You have permission from captain S.?\" he asked in surprise.    \"Yes, sir, from captain S. himself, and you can say to the chief of  police that we shall stay here until the captain orders us to leave,\"  saying which I stepped back into the tent.    The man retreated, muttering to himself as he went, for he was utterly  routed, and never returned; neither did we hear any more for some time  about moving our tents. It was as I suspected. Mr. Sourdough had thought  to frighten us away, and the order from the chief of police was utterly  bogus.    Some time afterward, when madam attempted to put a floor into her tent,  \"Sourdough\" again put in an appearance. He threatened, but she held out,  when the obstinate and perverse old man trotted off down town and  secured an officer and four soldiers to come and put her off. The  officer looked the ground over, inquired if there was room for teams to  pass if necessary, and seeing her tent in line with many others, he  turned to the old man and said:    \"This tent takes up no more of the street than the others. This lady has  as much right to be here as any one else. What is the matter with you?  Let the women alone,\" and he and his soldiers marched away.    Mr. Sourdough tore his hair. He was wild with anger. The floor of  madam's tent went down and stayed.    Each day I was in the habit of giving my Swedish friends a call, and  found them finally ready to set up their restaurant tent. A large floor  was laid on Second street near the post-office, the large canvas  stretched over the frame, tables and seats provided, a corner  partitioned off for a kitchen, dishes placed upon shelves, and they  began serving meals. At this juncture I happened in one day just before  noon and found them rushed with work and unable to fill their meal  orders for lack of help. Mary was peeling potatoes in haste, while  trying to do other things at the same time, and Ricka and Alma were  flying like bees.    \"Let me peel those potatoes for you,\" said I, taking the knife from  Mary's hand; and when she demurred, I told her I really had nothing to  do, and would be glad to assist.    When the potatoes were peeled, dishes were heaped up to be cleaned, and  I quickly washed them, feeling that I was of some service, and not  heeding the surprised looks of a few acquaintances who chanced to catch  a glimpse of me at work in the kitchen through the door.    This I did each day, coming over after I had eaten my breakfast, and  rolling up my sleeves to my elbows, drove them deep into the dish pan  and hot water.    Many were the jolly times we now had. How the jokes flew past each other  over the puddings, and the crisp pies needed almost no other seasoning.  How cheerfully \"the boys\" brought wood and water and counted it reward  enough if they only received a smile from little Alma. Many a man was  glad enough, too, to render such service for a meal or lunch of hot  coffee and doughnuts, especially such good, big, motherly ones as Mary  made, and there was no lack of men helpers. How the coffee steamed, the  hot bread and meats smoked, and the soup odors tantalized the  olfactories of hundreds of \"tenderfeet\" with their lusty Alaska  appetites, which were increased by an open air life such as all in those  days were living.    When at last we were summoned to our work, on Number Nine, the Swedish  women pressed my hand cordially, leaving a good-sized bill in it at the  same time, saying: \"When you get through on Number Nine come back to us;  we need you.\" I thanked them gratefully and said good-bye.    The English girl and myself were soon settled in our little tent with  its clean new floor on the hillside of claim Number Nine. No tree was to  be seen on the long, rolling hills, and only an occasional boulder on  some summit like Anvil Peak, perched as a sentinel above us. A few wild  flowers bloomed on the tundra, and the waters of the little stream  gurgled over the soft slate pebbles that strewed its course; but the  season so far was a dry one, and more water was needed before much could  be done at sluicing. Miners were not happy at the prospect of a dry  season, which meant a stoppage of all mining operations, and eagerly  scanned the heavens for rain indications. A small force of men were at  work night and day. On Thursday, July twelfth, eleven hundred dollars in  gold dust was taken from the sluice boxes in the creek, and two days  afterwards twelve thousand dollars, with which the owner of the claim  was much dissatisfied, calling them small clean-ups.    A few hundred feet up stream, on Number Ten, the machinery of C. D. Lane  whirred constantly. On the upper end of Number Nine a small new machine  called a separator was put in by some men from New York who had taken a  lay on the claim; but this scheme was not successful.    Seeing men at work prospecting along the \"benches,\" as the banks of a  stream or hillsides are called by miners, and having a woman's  proverbial curiosity, after my work was done I climbed the hill to  investigate. The prospectors had left after digging a hole about six  feet deep and four square, evidently having satisfied themselves as to  what the ground contained. Into this hole I descended to feel of the  cold, wet earth and inspect the walls.    The miners had reached the frost line and gone, taking with them samples  of pretty white quartz rock, as much of the debris at the bottom of the  hole plainly showed, but whether it contained gold I knew not. As yet I  was a tenderfoot; but something satisfactory was without doubt found  here and in the vicinity, as quartz claims were staked over the placer  claims the whole length of Anvil Creek that summer.    While rambling about in search of flowers during our afternoon rests, we  found many interesting spots. To the northwest, over the high, bare  ridge, lay Snow Gulch, from which fabulous sums had the summer before  been taken, the blue and winding waters of famous Glacier Creek lying  just beyond. Walking through the dry, deep tundra over the hills was  warm, hard work, though we wore short skirts and high, stout boots, and  womanlike, we were always filled to the brim with questions and ready to  rest if we chanced to meet any one, which was not often.    Wherever we went, and whatever the hour, we met with no incivility. Hats  were lifted, and men rested a moment upon their shovels to look after us  as we passed, while frequently some rough miner swallowed the lump in  his throat or wiped a tear, as he thought of"]]]
