So called because the projector was to have the  exclusive trade of Louisiana, on the banks of the Mississippi, on  condition of his taking on himself the National Debt (incorporated 1717,  failed 1720).    The debt was 208 millions sterling. Law made himself sole creditor of  this debt, and was allowed to issue ten times the amount in paper money,  and to open \"the Royal Bank of France,\" empowered to issue this paper  currency. So long as a 20-franc note was worth 20 francs, the scheme was  a prodigious success, but immediately the paper money was at a discount,  a run on the bank set in, and the whole scheme burst.      =Miss Ludington.= A beautiful girl changed by illness into \"a sad and  faded woman.\" She had a portrait painted from an ivory miniature of  herself, taken before the change, and conceives the idea that _what she  was once_ must still exist somewhere. The phantasy is played upon by  impostors, who undertake to materialize the fancied creature and  introduce her as the soul-sister of the credulous spinster. The  instrument of the audacious fraud becomes conscience stricken and  reveals it.--Edward Bellamy, _Miss Ludington's Sister_ (1884).      =Mistletoe Bough= (_The_). The song so called is by Thomas Haynes Bayley,  who died 1839. The tale is this: Lord Lovel married a young lady, a  baron's daughter, and on the wedding night the bride proposed that the  guest should play \"hide-and-seek.\" The bride hid in an old oak chest,  and the lid, falling down, shut her in, for it went with a spring-lock.  Lord Lovel sought her that night and sought next day, and so on for a  week, but nowhere could he find her. Some years later, the old chest was  sold, and, on being opened, was found to contain the skeleton of the  bride.    Rogers, in his _Italy_, gives the same story, and calls the lady  \"Ginevra\" of Mod[)e]na.    Collet, in his _Relics of Literature_, has a similar story.    Another is inserted in the _Causes C['e]l[`e]bres_.    Marwell Old Hall (near Winchester), once the residence of the Seymours,  and afterwards of the Dacre family, has a similar tradition attached to  it, and \"the very chest is said to be now the property of the Rev. J.  Haygarth, rector of Upham.\"    Bramshall, Hampshire, has a similar tale and chest.    The great house at Malsanger, near Basingstoke, also in Hampshire, has a  similar tradition connected with it.      =Mi'ta=, sister of Aude. She married Sir Miton de Rennes, and became the  mother of Mitaine. (See next art.)--_Croquemitaine_, xv.      =Mitaine=, daughter of Mita and Miton, and godchild of Charlemagne. She  went in search of Fear Fortress, and found that it existed only in the  imagination, for as she boldly advanced towards it, the castle gradually  faded into thin air. Charlemagne made Mitaine, for this achievement,  Roland's squire, and she fell with him in the memorable attack at  Roncesvall[^e]s. (See previous art.)--_Croquemitaine_, iii.      =Mite= (_Sir Matthew_), a returned East Indian merchant, dissolute,  dogmatical, ashamed of his former acquaintances, hating the aristocracy,  yet longing to be acknowledged by them. He squanders his wealth on  toadies, dresses his livery servants most gorgeously, and gives his  chairmen the most costly exotics to wear in their coats. Sir Matthew is  forever astonishing weak minds with his talk about rupees, lacs,  jaghires, and so on.--S. Foote, _The Nabob_.      =Mithra= or =Mithras=, a supreme divinity of the ancient Persians,  confounded by the Greeks and Romans with the _sun_. He is the  personification of Ormuzd, representing fecundity and perpetual  renovation. Mithra is represented as a young man with a Phrygian cap, a  tunic, a mantle on his left shoulder, and plunging a sword into the neck  of a bull. Scaliger says the word means \"greatest\" or \"supreme.\" Mithra  is the middle of the triplasian deity: the Mediator, Eternal Intellect,  and Architect of the world.        Her towers, where Mithra once had burned,      To Moslem shrines--oh shame!--were turned;      Where slaves, converted by the sword,      Their mean apostate worship poured,      And cursed the faith their sires adored.        Moore, _Lalla Rookh_ (\"The Fire-Worshippers,\" 1817).      =Mithridate= (3 _syl._), a medicinal confection, invented by  Damoc'rat[^e]s, physician to Mithrida't[^e]s, king of Pontus, and  supposed to be an antidote to all poisons and contagion. It contained  seventy-two ingredients. Any panacea is called a \"mithridate.\"        Their kinsman garlic bring, the poor man's mithridate.        Drayton, _Polyolbion_, xx. (1622).    _Mithridate_ (3 _syl._), a tragedy by Racine, (1673). \"Monime\" (2  _syl._), in this drama, was one of Mdlle. Rachel's great characters.      =Mithrida'tes= (4 _syl._), surnamed \"the Great.\" Being conquered by the  Romans, he tried to poison himself, but poison had no effect on him, and  he was slain by a Gaul. Mithridat[^e]s was active, intrepid,  indefatigable, and fruitful in resources; but he had to oppose such  generals as Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey. His ferocity was unbounded, his  perfidy was even grand.    [Asterism] Racine has written a French tragedy on the subject, called  _Mithridate_ (1673); and N. Lee brought out his _Mithridat[^e]s_ in  English about the same time.      =Mixit= (_Dr._), the apothecary at the Black Bear inn at Darlington.--Sir  W. Scott, _Rob Roy_ (time, George I.).      =M'liss=, brave, arch, and loving girl of the Wild West; the heroine of  one of Bret Harte's most popular sketches.      =M. M. Sketch= (_An_), a memorandum sketch.      =Mne'me= (2 _syl._), a well-spring of Boeo'tia, which quickens the memory.  The other well-spring in the same vicinity, called _L[^e]'th[^e]_, has the  opposite effect, causing blank forgetfulness.--Pliny.    Dant[^e] calls this river Eu'no[^e]. It had the power of calling to the  memory all the good acts done, all the graces bestowed, all the mercies  received, but no evil.--Dant[^e], _Purgatory_, xxxiii. (1308).      =Mo'ath=, a well-to-do Bedouin, father of Onei'za (3 _syl._), the  beloved of Thalaba. Oneiza, having married Thalaba, died on the bridal  night, and Moath arrived just in time to witness the mad grief of his  son-in-law.--Southey, _Thalaba, the Destroyer_, ii., viii. (1798).      =Mocca'sins=, an Indian buskin.         He laced his moccasins [_sic_] in act to go.         Campbell, _Gertrude of Wyoming_, i. 24 (1809).      =Mochingo=, an ignorant servant of the Princess Ero'ta.--Beaumont and  Fletcher, _The Laws of Candy_ (1647).      =Mock Doctor= (_The_), a farce by H. Fielding (1733), epitomized from  _Le M['e]decin Malgr['e] Lui_, of Moli[`e]re (1666). Sir Jasper wants to  make his daughter marry a Mr. Dapper; but she is in love with Leander  and pretends to be dumb. Sir Jasper hears of a dumb doctor, and sends  his two flunkies to fetch him. They ask one Dorcas to direct them to  him, and she points them to her husband, Gregory, a faggot-maker; but  tells them he is very eccentric, and must be well beaten, or he will  deny being a physician. The faggot-maker is accordingly beaten into  compliance, and taken to the patient. He soon learns the facts of the  case, and employs Leander as apothecary. Leander makes the lady speak,  and completes his cure with \"pills matrimoniac.\" Sir Jasper takes the  joke in good part, and becomes reconciled to the alliance.      =Mocking-Bird.= \"During the space of a minute, I have heard it imitate the  woodlark, chaffinch, blackbird, thrush, and sparrow.... Their few  natural notes resemble those of the nightingale, but their song is of  greater compass and more varied.\"--Ashe, _Travels in America_, ii. 73.      =Moclas=, a famous Arabian robber, whose name is synonymous with \"thief.\"  (See ALMANZOR, the caliph.)      =Mode= (_Sir William_), in Mrs. Centlivre's drama, _The Beaux' Duel_  (1703).      =Mode'love= (_Sir Philip_), one of the four guardians of Anne Lovely, the  heiress. Sir Philip is an \"old beau, that has May in his fancy and  dress, but December in his face and his heels. He admires all new  fashions ... loves operas, balls, and masquerades\" (act i. 1). Colonel  Freeman personates a French fop, and obtains his consent to marry his  ward, the heiress.--Mrs. Centlivre, _A Bold Stroke for a Wife_ (1717).      =Modely=, a man of the world, gay, fashionable, and a libertine. He had  scores of \"lovers,\" but never loved till he saw the little rustic lass  named Aura Freehold, a farmer's daughter, to whom he proposed  matrimony.--John Philip Kemble, _The Farm-house_.      =Modish= (_Lady Betty_), really in love with Lord Morelove, but treats him  with assumed scorn or indifference, because her pride prefers \"power to  ease.\" Hence she coquets with Lord Foppington (a married man), to  mortify Morelove and arouse his jealousy. By the advice of Sir Charles  Easy, Lord Morelove pays her out in her own coin, by flirting with Lady  Graveairs, and assuming an air of indifference. Ultimately, Lady Betty  is reduced to common sense, and gives her heart and hand to Lord  Morelove.--Colley Cibber, _The Careless Husband_ (1704).      =Modo=, the fiend that urges to murder, and one of the five that possessed  \"poor Tom.\"--Shakespeare, _King Lear_, act iv. sc. 1 (1605).      =Modred=, son of Lot, king of Norway, and Anne, own sister of King Arthur  (pt. viii. 21; ix. 9). He is always called \"the traitor.\" While King  Arthur was absent, warring with the Romans, Modred was left regent, but  usurped the crown, and married his aunt, the queen (pt. x. 13). When  Arthur heard thereof, he returned, and attacked the usurper, who fled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20877"],[0,"Mother West Wind's Children (#17)"],[1,".    \"Do you want me to play with you?\" asked Striped Chipmunk, suddenly.    Of course Danny did, and soon they were having the merriest kind of a  game of hide and seek.  Right in the midst of it Danny Meadow Mouse  caught his left foot in a root and twisted his ankle.  My, how it did  hurt!  In spite of himself tears did come into his eyes.  But he winked  them back and bravely began to laugh.    Striped Chipmunk helped him back to his doorstep and cut funny capers  while Mother Meadow Mouse bound up the hurt foot, and all the time  Danny Meadow Mouse laughed until pretty soon he forgot that his foot  ached at all.    When Peter Rabbit came jumping along up the Lone Little Path he began  to shout as soon as he saw Danny Meadow Mouse:      \"Cry, Danny, cry!    Mammy'll whip you by and by!    Then we'll all come 'round to see    How big a baby you can be.    Cry, Danny, cry!\"    But Danny didn't cry.  My, no!  He laughed instead.  Peter Rabbit was  so surprised that he stopped to see what had come over Danny Meadow  Mouse.  When he saw the bandaged foot and heard how Danny had twisted  his ankle Peter Rabbit sat right down on the doorstep beside Danny  Meadow Mouse and told him how sorry he was, for happy-go-lucky Peter  Rabbit is very tender-hearted.  Then he told Danny all about the  wonderful things he had seen in his travels, and of all the scrapes he  had gotten into.  When Peter Rabbit finally started off home Danny  Meadow Mouse still sat on his doorstep.  But no longer was he lonely.  He watched Old Mother West Wind trying to gather her Merry Little  Breezes into her big bag to take to their home behind the Purple Hills,  and he laughed right out when he saw her catch the last mischievous  Little Breeze and tumble him, heels over head, in with the others.    \"Old Mr. Toad was right, just exactly right,\" thought Danny Meadow  Mouse, as he rocked to and fro on his doorstep.  \"It _is_ much better,  oh very much better, to laugh than to cry.\"    And since that day when Danny Meadow Mouse learned to laugh, no one has  had a chance to point a finger at him and call him a cry-baby.  Instead  every one has learned to love merry little Danny Meadow Mouse, and now  they call him \"Laughing Dan.\""]]]
