Cromberger, one of Ballard's machine gun men,  distinguished himself by going single-handed into the Bolo lines to  reconnoiter.    The converging advances upon Plesetskaya by the three columns, up the  Onega Valley, on the railroad and on the Kodish-Plesetskaya-Petrograd  highway now seemed about to succeed. Hard fighting by all three columns  had broken the Bolshevik's confidence somewhat.    Of course at this time of writing it can be seen better than it could  then. He did not make a stand at Avda. He was found by our patrols way  back at Kochmas, only a few miles from the railroad. Meanwhile the  Russian Officers' Training Corps which was armed with forty Lewis guns  and acted rather independently, together with the Royal Scot platoon and  a large number of \"partisans,\" anti-Bolshevik volunteers of the area,  effected the capture of Shred Makhrenga, Taresevo and other villages,  which added to the threat of the Kodish force on Plesetskaya.    Plesetskaya at that moment was indeed of immense value to the Reds. It  was the railroad base of their four columns that were holding up the  left front of their Northern Army. But they were discouraged. Our  patrols and spies sent into Plesetskaya vicinity reported and stories of  deserters and wounded men all indicated that the Reds were getting ready  to evacuate Plesetskaya. A determined smash of the three Allied columns  would have won the coveted position. But the Kodish force now received  the same strange order from far-off Archangel that was received on the  other fronts:    \"To hold on and dig in.\" No further advances were to be made. Thinking  of their eleven comrades killed in this advance and of the thirty-one  wounded and of the many sick from exposure, the Americans on the Kodish  force as well as the English marines and Scots who also had lost  severely, were loath to stop with so easy a victory in sight.    Of course General Ironside's main idea was right, but its application at  that time and place seemed to work hardship on the Kodish force. And the  sequel proves it. To add to their discomfort, the very size of this  force which had struggled so valiantly this little distance, was now  reduced by the withdrawal of the English marines and of \"L\" Company, and  by the ordering of the Canadian artillery guns to the Dvina front. The  remaining force with Captain Donoghue totalled one hundred and eighty  men, which seemed very small to them, in view of the fact that a mere  reconnoitering patrol from the Bolos now returning to activity always  showed anywhere from seventy-five to one hundred rifles and a machine  gun or two. However, they made the best of their remaining days in  October to fortify the Kodish-Avda front sector of the road. The Yanks  were to be prepared for the worst. And they got it. Let us take a look  at the position held by these Americans. It is typical of the positions  in which many of the far-flung detachments found themselves.    At the seventeenth verst pole was a four-man outpost. At the sixteenth  verst pole Lieut. Ballard had two of his machine guns, a Lewis gun crew  and some forty-six men from \"K\" Company. Four versts behind him on the  densely wooded road Lieut. Gardner with forty men and a Vickers gun was  occupying the old Bolo dugouts. One verst further back in the big  clearing was Kodish village, a place which by all the rules of field  strategy was absolutely untenable. Here with four Vickers guns were the  remainder of \"K\" Company along with the sick and the lame and the halt,  scarce forty men really able to do active duty, but obliged to stay on  to support their comrades. The nearest friendly troops, including their  artillery, were back at Seletskoe, thirty versts away. On October 29th  the Reds returned to Avda. The noise from that village and reports  brought by patrols indicated that this enemy who erstwhile was on the  run, and whom our high command now held lightly, was determined to  regain Kodish. And while striking heavily at their enemy on the railroad  as we have seen, the Red Guards now fell upon this single company of  Americans strung out along the Kodish-Avda road.    In the afternoon of November 1st the enemy drove in our cossack post of  \"K\" men at verst seventeen, began shelling us with his artillery and for  several days kept raiding Ballard heavier and heavier. Meanwhile Captain  Donoghue sent out from Kodish every available man to strengthen the  line. Night and day the men labored to erect additional defenses, with  scarcely time to close an eye in sleep, patrolling all the trails on  their flanks. On the fourth of November, the day the Reds were massed in  such numbers on the railroad, they succeeded in forcing Ballard from his  trenches at the sixteenth verst pole. He fell back to the new defenses  at the fifteenth verst. It is related by his men that he passed between  Bolo forces who lined the road but permitted the Americans to escape.    Lieut. Gardner was now reinforced at the twelfth verst pole, for a  patrol had lost a man somewhere on the river flank and it was thought  that the enemy was preparing to pass by the flank and bag this body of  American fighters by taking the newly constructed bridge on the Emtsa in  the rear of Donoghue's small force. This bridge was their \"only way  home.\"    Their worst fears came true. On the morning of the fifth of November  these Yanks way out at front of Kodish, holding the enemy off  desperately from the frontal attack, and endeavoring vainly to frustrate  the flank attacks of their enemy in greatly superior numbers, suddenly  heard great bursts of machine gun fire way towards the rear in the  vicinity of Kodish. Instantly they knew that Reds had worked down the  river by the flank from Avda or even from Emtsa on the railroad and were  attacking in force three miles to their rear. That made the situation  desperate. But the Yanks who had in the beginning of the campaign been  looked down upon by the Red Capped British High Command because of their  greenness, now showed their fineness of fighting stuff by fighting on  with undiminished vigor and effectiveness. Nowhere did they give way.  Day and night they were on the alert. Attacks from the front, sly raids  from the woods on each side of the road, heart chilling assaults upon  the cluster of houses in Kodish way in their rear, and steady progress  of the Red Guards toward the bridge on the Emtsa, their only way out of  the bag in which the worn and depleted company was being trapped,  brought the prolonged struggle to a crisis in the middle of the  afternoon of the eighth of November.    It came as follows: Colonel Hazelden, survivor of the disaster earlier  in the fall, as already related, had returned to command the  Kodish-Shred Makhrenga fronts, when Col. Gavin was sent to command the  railroad front where Colonel Sutherland had fizzled.    This gallant officer was on his way to the perilous front to see  Ballard. Just as he passed Gardner at the twelfth verst pole, he found  himself and the two detachments of Americans at last completely cut off  by a whole battalion of Red Guards fresh from the south of Russia, sent  up by Trotsky to brace his Northern Army. For half an hour there raged a  fight as intense as was the bitter reality of the emergency to the forty  Americans with Gardner in those dugouts. By almost miraculous luck in  directing their fire through the screen of trees that shielded the Reds  from view, Sgt. Cromberger's Vickers gun and Cpl. Wilkie's Lewis gun  inflicted terrible losses upon this fresh battalion just getting into  action against the Americanskis. It was massed preparatory to the final  dispositions of its commander to overwhelm the Americans. But with the  hail of bullets tearing through their heavy ranks, the Bolos were unable  long to stand it, and at last broke from control, yelling and screaming,  to suffer still more from the well-handled guns when they left their  cover and ran for the woods. And so the little force was saved. But so  loud and prolonged were the yells of the frightened and wounded Reds  that Captain Donoghue, a verst in the rear at his field headquarters, he  related afterwards, paced the floor of the log shack in an agony of  certainty that his brave men were all gone. He had been sure that the  howling of the scattered pack had been the fervent yells of a last  bayonet charge wiping out the Yankees.    The Reds could not get themselves together for another attack at this  point before dark but did drive Ballard back verst after verst that  afternoon. It was a grim handful of \"M. G.\" and \"K\" men who looked at  their own losses and counted the huge enemy losses of that desperate day  and wondered how many such days would whittle them off to the point of  annihilation. Col. Hazelden had gone back to headquarters. Captain  Donoghue now acted with his usual decisiveness.    The Americanskis had slipped out of the bag before the Red string was  tied. And in the morning of the 9th of November the good old Vickers  guns and Lewis guns were peeking from their old concealed strongholds on  the American side of the Emtsa. Artillery support was reported on the  way to argue with the Bolo artillery. A platoon of \"L\" Company which had  come up during the last of the fighting, together with a platoon of  replacement men from the old Division in France, who had just come  across the trail from the railroad, now took over the active defense of  the bridge.    Both sides began digging in. American Engineers came up to build block  houses. And the fagged warriors of machine gun and \"K\" infantry men now  retired a short distance to the rear to make themselves as comfortable  as possible in the woods, and try to forget their recent harrowing  experiences and the sight of the seven bleeding stretchers that were  part of the cost of trying to hold a place that was a veritable death"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22542"],[0,"Jesus the Christ (#17)"],[1,"imprecation:  \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\"[172]    The origin of the Pharisees is not fixed by undisputed authority as to  either time or circumstance; though it is probable that the sect or  party had a beginning in connection with the return of the Jews from the  Babylonian captivity. New ideas and added conceptions of the meaning of  the law were promulgated by Jews who had imbibed of the spirit of  Babylon; and the resulting innovations were accepted by some and  rejected by others. The name \"Pharisee\" does not occur in the Old  Testament, nor in the Apocrypha, though it is probable that the  Assideans mentioned in the books of the Maccabees[173] were the original  Pharisees. By derivation the name expresses the thought of separatism;  the Pharisee, in the estimation of his class, was distinctively set  apart from the common people, to whom he considered himself as truly  superior as the Jews regarded themselves in contrast with other nations.  Pharisees and scribes were one in all essentials of profession, and  rabbinism was specifically their doctrine.    In the New Testament the Pharisees are often mentioned as in opposition  to the Sadducees; and such were the relations of the two parties that it  becomes a simpler matter to contrast one with the other than to consider  each separately. The Sadducees came into existence as a reactionary  organization during the second century B.C., in connection with an  insurgent movement against the Maccabean party. Their platform was that  of opposition to the ever-increasing mass of traditional lore, with  which the law was not merely being fenced or hedged about for safety,  but under which it was being buried. The Sadducees stood for the  sanctity of the law as written and preserved, while they rejected the  whole mass of rabbinical precept both as orally transmitted and as  collated and codified in the records of the scribes. The Pharisees  formed the more popular party; the Sadducees figured as the aristocratic  minority. At the time of Christ's birth the Pharisees existed as an  organized body numbering over six thousand men, with Jewish women very  generally on their side in sympathy and effort;[174] while the Sadducees  were so small a faction and of such limited power that, when they were  placed in official positions, they generally followed the policy of the  Pharisees as a matter of incumbent expediency. The Pharisees were the  Puritans of the time, unflinching in their demand for compliance with  the traditional rules as well as the original law of Moses. In this  connection note Paul's confession of faith and practise when arraigned  before Agrippa--\"That after the most straitest sect of our religion I  lived a Pharisee.\"[175] The Sadducees prided themselves on strict  compliance with the law, as they construed it, irrespective of all  scribes or rabbis. The Sadducees stood for the temple and its prescribed  ordinances, the Pharisees for the synagog and its rabbinical teachings.  It is difficult to decide which were the more technical if we judge each  party by the standard of its own profession. By way of illustration: the  Sadducees held to the literal and full exaction of the Mosaic  penalty--an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth[176]--while the  Pharisees contended on the authority of rabbinical dictum, that the  wording was figurative, and that therefore the penalty could be met by a  fine in money or goods.    Pharisees and Sadducees differed on many important if not fundamental  matters of belief and practise, including the preexistence of spirits,  the reality of a future state involving reward and punishment, the  necessity for individual self-denial, the immortality of the soul, and  the resurrection from the dead; in each of which the Pharisees stood for  the affirmative while the Sadducees denied.[177] Josephus avers--the  doctrine of the Sadducees is that the soul and body perish together; the  law is all that they are concerned to observe.[178] They were \"a  skeptical school of aristocratic traditionalists; adhering only to the  Mosaic law.\"[179]    Among the many other sects and parties established on the ground of  religious or political differences, or both, are the Essenes, the  Nazarites, the Herodians and the Galileans. The Essenes were  characterized by professions of ultra-piety; they considered even the  strictness of Pharisaic profession as weak and insufficient; they  guarded membership in their order by severe exactions extending through  a first and a second novitiate; they were forbidden even to touch food  prepared by strangers; they practised strict temperance and rigid  self-denial, indulged in hard labor--preferably that of agriculture, and  were forbidden to trade as merchants, to take part in war, or to own or  employ slaves.[180] Nazarites are not named in the New Testament, though  of specific record in the earlier scriptures;[181] and from sources  other than scriptural we learn of their existence at and after the time  of Christ. The Nazarite was one of either sex who was bound to  abstinence and sacrifice by a voluntary vow for special service to God;  the period of the vow might be limited or for life. While the Essenes  cultivated an ascetic brotherhood, the Nazarites were devoted to  solitary discipline.    The Herodians constituted a politico-religious party who favored the  plans of the Herods under the professed belief that through that dynasty  alone could the status of the Jewish people be maintained and a  reestablishment of the nation be secured. We find mention of the  Herodians laying aside their partisan antipathies and acting in concert  with the Pharisees in the effort to convict the Lord Jesus and bring Him  to death.[182] The Galileans or people of Galilee were distinguished  from their fellow Israelites of Judea by greater simplicity and less  ostentatious devotion in matters pertaining to the law. They were  opposed to innovations, yet were generally more liberal or less bigoted  than some of the professedly devout Judeans. They were prominent as able  defenders in the wars of the people, and won for themselves a reputation  for bravery and patriotism. They are mentioned in connection with  certain tragical occurrences during our Lord's lifetime.[183]    The authority of the priesthood was outwardly acknowledged by the Jews  at the time of Christ; and the appointed order of service for priest and  Levite was duly observed. During the reign of David, the descendants of  Aaron, who were the hereditary priests in Israel, had been divided into  twenty-four courses,[184] and to each course the labors of the sanctuary  were alloted in turn. Representatives of but four of these courses  returned from the captivity, but from these the orders were  reconstructed on the original plan. In the days of Herod the Great the  temple ceremonies were conducted with great display and outward  elaborateness, as an essential matter of consistency with the splendor  of the structure, which surpassed in magnificence all earlier  sanctuaries.[185] Priests and Levites, therefore, were in demand for  continuous service, though the individuals were changed at short  intervals according to the established system. In the regard of the  people the priests were inferior to the rabbis, and the scholarly  attainments of a scribe transcended in honor that pertaining to  ordination in the priesthood. The religion of the time was a matter of  ceremony and formality, of ritual and performance; it had lost the very  spirit of worship, and the true conception of the relationship between  Israel and Israel's God was but a dream of the past.    Such in brief were the principal features of the world's condition, and  particularly as concerns the Jewish people, when Jesus the Christ was  born in the meridian of time.      NOTES TO CHAPTER 6.    1. The Sanhedrin.--This, the chief court or high council of the Jews,  derives its name from the Greek _sunedrion_, signifying \"a council.\" In  English it is sometimes though inaccurately, written \"Sanhedrim.\" The  Talmud traces the origin of this body to the calling of the seventy  elders whom Moses associated with himself, making seventy-one in all, to  administer as judges in Israel (Numb. 11:16, 17). The Sanhedrin in the  time of Christ, as also long before, comprized seventy-one members,  including the high-priest who presided in the assembly. It appears to  have been known in its earlier period as the Senate, and was  occasionally so designated even after Christ's death (Josephus,  Antiquities xii, 3:3; compare Acts 5:21); the name \"Sanhedrin\" came into  general use during the reign of Herod the Great; but the term is not of  Biblical usage; its equivalent in the New Testament is \"council\" (Matt.  5:22; 10:17; 26:59) though it must be remembered that the same term is  applied to courts of lesser jurisdiction than that of the Sanhedrin, and  to local tribunals. (Matt 5:22; 10:17; 26:59; Mark 13:9; see also Acts  25:12.)    The following, from the _Standard Bible Dictionary_, is instructive:  \"Those qualified to be members were in general of the priestly house and  especially of the Sadducean nobility. But from the days of Queen  Alexandra (69-68 B.C.) onward, there were with these chief priests also  many Pharisees in it under the name of scribes and elders. These three  classes are found combined in Matt. 27:41; Mark 11:27; 14:43, 53; 15:1.  How such members were appointed is not entirely clear. The aristocratic  character of the body and the history of its origin forbid the belief  that it was by election. Its nucleus probably consisted of the members  of certain ancient families, to which, however, from time to time others  were added by the secular rulers. The presiding officer was the high  priest, who at first exercized in it more than the authority of a  member, claiming a voice equal to that of the rest of the body.
