Taking the  grandmother's hand, she said: \"Good-bye, I must go home to grandfather  now, but I shall come again tomorrow. Good-night, grandmother.\"    \"Oh, please come again to-morrow, Heidi,\" implored the old woman,  while she held her fast.    \"Why did you take your pretty dress off?\" asked Brigida.    \"I'd rather go to grandfather that way, or else he might not know me  any more, the way you did.\"    Brigida accompanied the child outside and said mysteriously: \"He would  have known you in your frock; you ought to have kept it on. Please be  careful, child, for Peter tells us that the uncle never says a word  to anyone and always seems so angry.\" But Heidi was unconcerned, and  saying good-night, climbed up the path with the basket on her arm. The  evening sun was shining down on the grass before her. Every few  minutes Heidi stood still to look at the mountains behind her.  Suddenly she looked back and beheld such glory as she had not even  seen in her most vivid dream. The rocky peaks were flaming in the  brilliant light, the snow-fields glowed and rosy clouds were floating  overhead. The grass was like an expanse of gold, and below her the  valley swam in golden mist. The child stood still, and in her joy and  transport tears ran down her cheeks. She folded her hands, and looking  up to heaven, thanked the Lord that He had brought her home again. She  thanked Him for restoring her to her beloved mountains,--in her  happiness she could hardly find words to pray. Only when the glow had  subsided, was Heidi able to follow the path again.    [Illustration: THROWING HERSELF IN HER GRANDFATHER'S ARMS, SHE HELD  HIM TIGHT]    She climbed so fast that she could soon discover, first the tree-tops,  then the roof, finally the hut. Now she could see her grandfather  sitting on his bench, smoking a pipe. Above the cottage the fir-trees  gently swayed and rustled in the evening breeze. At last she had  reached the hut, and throwing herself in her grandfather's arms, she  hugged him and held him tight. She could say nothing but \"Grandfather!  grandfather! grandfather!\" in her agitation.    The old man said nothing either, but his eyes were moist, and  loosening Heidi's arms at last, he sat her on his knee. When he had  looked at her a while, he said: \"So you have come home again, Heidi?  Why? You certainly do not look very cityfied! Did they send you away?\"    \"Oh no, you must not think that, grandfather. They all were so good to  me; Clara, Mr. Sesemann and grandmama. But grandfather, sometimes I  felt as if I could not bear it any longer to be away from you! I  thought I should choke; I could not tell any one, for that would have  been ungrateful. Suddenly, one morning Mr. Sesemann called me very  early, I think it was the doctor's fault and--but I think it is  probably written in this letter;\" with that Heidi brought the letter  and the bank-roll from her basket, putting them on her grandfather's  lap.    \"This belongs to you,\" he said, laying the roll beside him. Having  read the letter, he put it in his pocket.    \"Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?\" he asked,  while he stepped into the cottage. \"Take your money with you, you can  buy a bed for it and clothes for many years.\"    \"I don't need it at all, grandfather,\" Heidi assured him; \"I have a  bed and Clara has given me so many dresses that I shan't need any more  all my life.\"    \"Take it and put it in the cupboard, for you will need it some day.\"    Heidi obeyed, and danced around the hut in her delight to see all the  beloved things again. Running up to the loft, she exclaimed in great  disappointment: \"Oh grandfather, my bed is gone.\"    \"It will come again,\" the grandfather called up from below; \"how could  I know that you were coming back? Get your milk now!\"    Heidi, coming down, took her old seat. She seized her bowl and emptied  it eagerly, as if it was the most wonderful thing she had ever tasted.  \"Grandfather, our milk is the best in all the world.\"    Suddenly Heidi, hearing a shrill whistle, rushed outside, as Peter and  all his goats came racing down. Heidi greeted the boy, who stopped,  rooted to the spot, staring at her. Then she ran into the midst of her  beloved friends, who had not forgotten her either. Schwaenli and Baerli  bleated for joy, and all her other favorites pressed near to her.  Heidi was beside herself with joy, and caressed little Snowhopper and  patted Thistlefinch, till she felt herself pushed to and fro among  them.    \"Peter, why don't you come down and say good-night to me?\" Heidi  called to the boy.    \"Have you come again?\" he exclaimed at last. Then he took Heidi's  proffered hand and asked her, as if she had been always there: \"Are  you coming up with me to-morrow?\"    \"No, to-morrow I must go to grandmother, but perhaps the day after.\"    Peter had a hard time with his goats that day, for they would not  follow him. Over and over again they came back to Heidi, till she  entered the shed with Baerli and Schwaenli and shut the door.    When Heidi went up to her loft to sleep, she found a fresh, fragrant  bed waiting for her; and she slept better that night than she had for  many, many months, for her great and burning longing had been  satisfied. About ten times that night the grandfather rose from his  couch to listen to Heidi's quiet breathing. The window was filled up  with hay, for from now on the moon was not allowed to shine on Heidi  any more. But Heidi slept quietly, for she had seen the flaming  mountains and had heard the fir-trees roar.          XIV    ON SUNDAY WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS RING      Heidi was standing under the swaying fir-trees, waiting for her  grandfather to join her. He had promised to bring up her trunk from  the village while she went in to visit the grandmother. The child was  longing to see the blind woman again and to hear how she had liked the  rolls. It was Saturday, and the grandfather had been cleaning the  cottage. Soon he was ready to start. When they had descended and Heidi  entered Peter's hut, the grandmother called lovingly to her: \"Have you  come again, child?\"    She took hold of Heidi's hand and held it tight. Grandmother then told  the little visitor how good the rolls had tasted, and how much  stronger she felt already. Brigida related further that the  grandmother had only eaten a single roll, being so afraid to finish  them too soon. Heidi had listened attentively, and said now:  \"Grandmother, I know what I shall do. I am going to write to Clara and  she'll surely send me a whole lot more.\"    But Brigida remarked: \"That is meant well, but they get hard so soon.  If I only had a few extra pennies, I could buy some from our baker. He  makes them too, but I am hardly able to pay for the black bread.\"    Heidi's face suddenly shone. \"Oh, grandmother, I have an awful lot of  money,\" she cried. \"Now I know what I'll do with it. Every day you  must have a fresh roll and two on Sundays. Peter can bring them up  from the village.\"    \"No, no, child,\" the grandmother implored. \"That must not be. You must  give it to grandfather and he'll tell you what to do with it.\"    But Heidi did not listen but jumped gaily about the little room,  calling over and over again: \"Now grandmother can have a roll every  day. She'll get well and strong, and,\" she called with fresh delight,  \"maybe your eyes will see again, too, when you are strong and well.\"    The grandmother remained silent, not to mar the happiness of the  child. Seeing the old hymn-book on the shelf, Heidi said:    \"Grandmother, shall I read you a song from your book now? I can read  quite nicely!\" she added after a pause.    \"Oh yes, I wish you would, child. Can you really read?\"    Heidi, climbing on a chair, took down the dusty book from a shelf.  After she had carefully wiped it off, she sat down on a stool.    \"What shall I read, grandmother?\"    \"Whatever you want to,\" was the reply. Turning the pages, Heidi found  a song about the sun, and decided to read that aloud. More and more  eagerly she read, while the grandmother, with folded arms, sat in her  chair. An expression of indescribable happiness shone in her  countenance, though tears were rolling down her cheeks. When Heidi  had repeated the end of the song a number of times, the old woman  exclaimed: \"Oh, Heidi, everything seems bright to me again and my  heart is light. Thank you, child, you have done me so much good.\"    Heidi looked enraptured at the grandmother's face, which had changed  from an old, sorrowful expression to a joyous one.    She seemed to look up gratefully, as if she could already behold the  lovely, celestial gardens told of in the hymn.    Soon the grandfather knocked on the window, for it was time to go.  Heidi followed quickly, assuring the grandmother that she would visit  her every day now; on the days she went up to the pasture with Peter,  she would return in the early afternoon, for she did not want to miss  the chance to make the grandmother's heart joyful and light. Brigida  urged Heidi to take her dress along, and with it on her arm the child  joined the old man and immediately told him what had happened.    On hearing of her plan to purchase rolls for the grandmother every  day, the grandfather reluctantly consented.    At this the child gave a bound, shouting: \"Oh grandfather, now  grandmother won't ever have to eat hard, black bread any more. Oh,  everything is so wonderful now! If God Our Father had done immediately  what I prayed for, I should have come home at once and could not have  brought half as many rolls to grandmother. I should not have been able  to read either. Grandmama told me that God would make everything much  better than I could ever dream. I shall always pray from now on, the  way grandmama taught me. When God does not give me something I pray  for, I shall always remember how everything has worked out for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#17)"],[1,"wake. They'd sit up  all night and sing and pray and talk. At midnight they'd serve  sandwiches and coffee. Sometimes we'd all get together and play ring  plays and dance.    Once the Yankee soldiers come. I was big enough to tote pails and  piggins then. These soldiers made us chillun tote water to fill their  canteens and water their horses. We toted the water on our heads.  Another time we heard the Yankee's was coming and old Master had about  fifteen hundred pounds of meat. They was hauling it off to bury it and  hide it when the Yankees caught them. The soldiers ate and wasted  every bit of that good meat. We didn't like them a bit.    One time some Yankee soldiers stopped and started talking to me--they  asked me what my name was. \"I say Liza,\" and they say, \"Liza who?\" I  thought a minute and I shook my head, \"Jest Liza, I ain't got no other  name.\"    He say, \"Who live up yonder in dat Big House?\" I say, \"Mr. John  Mixon.\" He say, \"You are Liza Mixon.\" He say, \"Do anybody ever call  you nigger?\" And I say, \"Yes Sir.\" He say, \"Next time anybody call you  nigger you tell 'em dat you is a Negro and your name is Miss Liza  Mixon.\" The more I thought of that the more I liked it and I made up  my mind to do jest what he told me to.    My job was minding the calves back while the cows was being milked.  One evening I was minding the calves and old Master come along. He  say, \"What you doin' nigger?\" I say real pert like, \"I ain't no  nigger, I'se a Negro and I'm Miss Liza Mixon.\" Old Master sho' was  surprised and he picks up a switch and starts at me.    Law, but I was skeered! I hadn't never had no whipping so I run fast  as I can to Grandma Gracie. I hid behind her and she say, \"What's the  matter of you child?\" And I say, \"Master John gwine whip me.\" And she  say, \"What you done?\" And I say, \"Nothing.\" She say she know better  and 'bout that time Master John got there. He say, \"Gracie, dat little  nigger sassed me.\" She say, \"Lawsie child, what does ail you?\" I told  them what the Yankee soldier told me to say and Grandma Gracie took my  dress and lift it over my head and pins my hands inside, and Lawsie,  how she whipped me and I dassent holler loud either. I jest said dat  [HW: to] de wrong person. [TR: \"didn't I?\" at end was crossed out.]    I'se getting old now and can't work no more. I jest sits here and  thinks about old times. They was good times. We didn't want to be  freed. We hated the Yankee soldiers. Abe Lincoln was a good man  though, wasn't he? I tries to be a good Christian 'cause I wants to go  to Heaven when I die.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    LIZZIE FARMER  Age 80 years  McAlester, Okla.      \"Cousin Lizzie!\"    \"What.\"    \"I'se seventy years old.\"    And I say, \"Whut's you telling me for. I ain't got nothing to do with  your age!\"    I knowed I was one year older than she was and it sorta riled me for  her to talk about it. I never would tell folks my age for I knowed  white folks didn't want no old woman working for 'em and I just  wouldn't tell 'em how old I really was. Dat was nine years ago and I  guess I'm seventy five now. I can't work much now.    I was born four years before de War.--\"The one what set the cullud  folks free.\" We lived on a big plantation in Texas. Old Master's name  was John Booker and he was good to us all. My mammy died just at de  close of de War and de young mistress took me and kept me and I growed  up with her chillun. I thought I was quality sure nuff and I never  would go to school 'cause I couldn't go 'long to de same school with  de white chillun. Young mistress taught me how to knit, spin, weave,  crochet, sew and embroider. I couldn't recollect my age and young  Mistress told me to say, \"I'se born de second year of de War dat set  de cullud folks free,\" and the only time she ever git mad at me was  when I forgot to say it jest as she told me to. She take hold of me  and shook me. I recollects all it, all de time.    Young mistress' name was Elizabeth Booker McNew. I'se named after her.  She finally gave me to my aunt when I was a big girl and I never lived  wid white folks any more. I never saw my pappy till I was grown.    In the cullud quarters, we cooked on a fireplace in big iron pots. Our  bread was baked in iron skillets with lids and we would set the  skillet on de fire and put coals of fire on de lid. Bread was mighty  good cooked like dat. We made our own candles. We had a candle mold  and we would put a string in the center of the mold and pour melted  tallow in it and let it harden. We would make eight at one time.  Quality folks had brass lamps.    When we went to cook our vegetables we would put a big piece of hog  jowl in de pot. We'd put in a lot of snap beans and when dey was about  half done we'd put in a mess of cabbage and when it was about half  done we'd put in some squash and when it was about half done we'd put  in some okra. Then when it was done we would take it out a layer at a  time. Go 'way! It makes me hungry to talk about it.    When we cooked possum dat was a feast. We would skin him and dress him  and put him on top de house and let him freeze for two days or nights.  Then we'd boil him with red pepper, and take him out and put him in a  pan and slice sweet 'taters and put round him and roast him. My, dat  was good eating.    It was a long time after de War 'fore all de niggers knowed dey was  really free. My grandpappy was Master Booker's overseer. He wouldn't  have a white man over his niggers. I saw grandpappy whip one man with  a long whip. Master Booker was good and wouldn't whip 'em less'n he  had to. De niggers dassent leave de farm without a pass for fear of de  Ku Kluxers and patrolers.    We would have dances and play parties and have sho' nuff good times.  We had \"ring plays.\" We'd all catch hands and march round, den we'd  drop all hands 'cept our pardners and we'd swing round and sing:        \"You steal my pardner, and I steal yours,      Miss Mary Jane.      My true lover's gone away,      Miss Mary Jane!        \"Steal all round and don't slight none,      Miss Mary Jane.      He's lost out but I'se got one,      Miss Mary Jane!\"    We always played at log rollin's an' cotton pickin's.    Sometimes we would have a wedding and my what a good time we'd have.  Old Master's daughter, Miss Janie, got married and it took us more'n  three weeks to get ready for it. De house was cleaned from top to  bottom and us chillun had to run errands. Seemed like we was allers  under foot, at least dat was what mammy said. I never will fergit all  the good things they cooked up. Rows of pies and cakes, baked chicken  and ham, my, it makes my mouth water jest thinking of it. After de  wedding and de feast de white folks danced all night and us cullud  folks ate all night.    When one of de cullud folks die we would allers hold a \"wake.\" We  would set up with de corpse and sing and pray and at midnight we'd all  eat and den we'd sing and pray some more.    In de evening after work was done we'd sit round and de older folks  would sing songs. One of de favorites was:        \"Miss Ca'line gal,      Yes Ma'am      Did you see dem buzzards?      Yes Ma'am,      Did you see dem floppin',      How did ye' like 'em?      Mighty well.        \"Miss Ca'line gal,      Yes Ma'am,      Did you see dem buzzards?      Yes Ma'am,      Did you see dem sailin',      Yes Ma'am.      How did you like 'em?      Mighty well.\"    I've heered folks talk about conjures and hoodoo charms. I have a hoss  shoe over de door dat will bring good luck. I sho' do believe certain  things bring bad luck. I hate to hear a scrinch (screech) owl holler  at night. Whenever a scrinch owl git in dat tree at night and start to  holler I gits me a stick and I say, \"Confound you, I'll make yet set  up dar and say 'Umph huh',\" so I goes out and time I gits dar he is  gone. If you tie a knot in de corner of de bed sheet he will leave, or  turn your hat wrong side out too. Dey's all good and will make a  scrinch owl leave every time.    I believes in dreams and visions too. I dreamed one night dat I had  tall palings all 'round my house and I went out in de yard and dere  was a big black hoss and I say, \"How come you is in my yard? I'll jest  put you out jest lak you got in.\" I opened de gate but he wouldn't go  out and finally he run in de door and through the house and went  towards de East. Right after dat my son died. I saw dat hoss again de  other night. A black hoss allus means death. Seeing it de other night  might mean I'se gwineter die.    I know one time a woman named May Runnels wanted to go to church about  a mile away and her old man wouldn't go with her. It made her mad and  she say, \"I'll be dammed if I don't go.\" She had to go through a grave  yard and when she was about half way across it a icy hand jest slap  her and her mouth was twisted way 'round fer about three months. Dat  was a lesson to her fer cussing.    One time there was a nigger what belonged on a adjoining farm to  Master John Bookers and dey told us dis story:    \"Dis nigger went down to de spring and found a terrapin and he say,  'What brung you here?' Jest imagine how he felt when it say to him,  'Teeth and tongue brung me here, and teeth and tongue will bring you  here.' He run to de house and told his Master dat he found a terrapin  dat could talk. Dey went back and he asked de terrapin what bring him  here and it wouldn't say a word. Old Master didn't like it 'cause he  went down there jest to see a common ordinary terrapin and he told de  nigger he was going to git into trouble fer telling him a lie. Next  day the nigger seen de terrapin and it say de same thing again. Soon  after dat dis nigger was lynched right close to de place he saw de  terrapin.\"    Master John Booker had two niggers what had a habit of slipping across  de river and killing old Master's hogs and hiding de meat in de loft  of de house. Master had a big blue hog and one day he missed him and "]]]
