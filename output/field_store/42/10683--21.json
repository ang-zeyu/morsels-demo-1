[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#17)"],[1,"nothing except an immediate ride.    With one high spring, Lad had cleared the ground and was over the  closed tonneau door and amid a ruck of luggage and rugs. The rear seat  was filled by a steamer-trunk, strapped tightly in place there. And the  bottom of the car was annoyingly crowded by bumpy bags and other gear.    Still, by the simple and ancestral process of turning himself around  several times, Lad was able to clear enough space on the floor to  permit of his lying down; albeit in a very compact bunch.    He settled himself into place on the floor with a satisfied jounce  which loosened a car-rug draped over the trunk. Down slithered the rug;  and fell athwart the dog's shaggy back and one of the bags. It was not  heavy enough to annoy Lad or hurt his feelings. And its draped folds  served as the top of a sort of cave for him. On the whole, Lad rather  enjoyed the rug's descent. It made his narrow resting-place snugger and  warmer on this chilly early morning. Patiently, Lad lay there; waiting  for the car to start.    He did not have long to wait. In another minute or two, the Mistress  and the Master came out from breakfast; and got into the front seat.  Then the car was breasting the winding slope of the drive, in first  speed; the faint jar of the engine sending undulations over the  mahogany-and-white coat of the stowaway dog. And, in a minute more,  they were out on the smooth highway, headed for the distant Catskills.    Now, Lad had not the remotest notion he was a stowaway. On the few  times when it had not been convenient to take him on drives, the Master  had always bidden him stay at home. And when, at such times, the dog  chanced already to be its the car, he had been ordered back to earth.  There, was no way for Lad to know, this morning, that neither of the  car's other occupants had seen him as he lay curled up on the floor,  three-quarters hidden under the fallen rug. The luggage had been  arranged in the tonneau, before breakfast. And nobody had given a  second glance at it since then.    The sun was rising over a new-made world, alive with summer glory and  thrilling with bird-songs. The air, later in the day, would be warm.  But, at sunrise, it was sharp and bracing. The mystic wonder and the  hush of dawn were still brooding over the earth. The hard white road  stretched out, like a winding river, between banks of dew-gleaming  verdure. The mountain-tops were glowing with the touch of the sun. In  the deeper valleys floated a shimmering dusk.    The car sped swiftly along the empty highway; slowing down only as it  spun through half-awakened villages; or checked its pace to allow a  sleepy boy to drive a straggling bunch of cows across the road to  pasturage.    For an hour or more, Lad lay cuddled under the rug in contented  laziness. Then the recumbent posture tired him; and he sat up. As a  rule, one or the other of his deities was wont to turn around, at  intervals, and speak to him or pet him. Today, neither of them paid him  the slightest attention. Still, the ride was a joy. And the surrounding  country was new and interesting. So Lad had a good time, in spite of  human neglect. After another hour or so, he curled up again, among the  bags, and fell to drowsing.    A six-hour run, over good roads, brought the car to Kingston, at the  gateway to the Catskills. Here, at a hotel entrance, the machine came  to a standstill. The Master got out, and turned to help the Mistress to  alight. It was the place they had decided on for luncheon. Another  three hours, at most, would carry them to their destination.    A negro boy, loafing aimlessly at the street corner, had begun to  whistle industriously to himself as the car slowed down. And he had  wakened into active motion. Apparently, he remembered all at once an  important mission on the other side of the street. For he set off at a  swinging pace.    His course took him so near the back of the car that he had to turn  out, a step or so, to avoid collision with it. He accompanied this  turning-out maneuver by another which was less ostentatious, but more  purposeful. Timing his steps, so as to pass by the rear of the car just  as the Master was busy helping his wife to descend, the youth thrust an  arm over the side of the tonneau, with the speed of a striking snake.  His hand closed on the handle of a traveling bag, among the heap of  luggage. Never slackening his pace, the negro gave a fierce yank at his  plunder, to hoist it over the closed door.    In that tourist-ridden city, bag-stealing offered much profit. In the  rare chance of detection when he was at work, the boy had only to plead  over-zeal in trying to earn an honest dime by helping lift the luggage  to the sidewalk.    It was a pretty bit of theft; and it betokened long and careful  practice. Thus,--from the thief's standpoint,--it was almost a pity the  brilliant effort was wasted. For wasted it was.    This young negro prided himself on his powers of speed and of silence,  in plying his trade. And, today, though he proceeded to excel in the  first of these qualities, he disgraced himself most woefully as  regarded the second.    For he jerked his hand out of the tonneau far faster than he had thrust  it in. As he did so, he woke the echoes with the most blood-curdling  screech his leathern lungs could compass.    As his dusky fingers had closed on the bag, something viselike and  relentless had fastened upon those same expert fingers; breaking two of  them, and rending the flesh of the lower hand.    Lad, in rising to his feet, after his pleasant nap, at the slowing of  the car, had been aware of that predatory hand; as it groped for the  bag. Now, from puppyhood, Lad had been taught to regard everything in  the car as under his own careful guardianship. Hence, he lunged forward  and sank his terrible white teeth deep into the groping fingers.    By main force the youth tore free. With a second screech, he reeled  back from the unseen peril which had assailed him. But Lad would not  have it so.    There was a harsh-breathed growl, from down in the tonneau; and, on the  instant, a tawny giant shape came catapulting over the top of the shut  door and hurled itself upon the staggering negro.    The Master, turning at sound of the yell, was just in time to see the  attack. The collie,--supposedly ninety miles away, and peacefully  guarding the Place,--was hurtling through the air and crashing against  the chest of a gray-faced and pop-eyed young negro. To earth went the  two; in a cloud of dust; a second before the Master's sharp call  brought Lad reluctantly away from his prey, and just as a policeman and  a score of idlers came running up.    The thief did not wait to explain. No sooner did he see the Master  catch the infuriated dog by the ruff than he scrambled to his feet;  ducked under the policeman's arm and set off, around a corner, in  something better than record time. Somehow, the encounter had deprived  him of the nerve and the pluck to stand his ground and to explain that  he had merely been trying to help with the luggage. His only desire,  just then, was to put as many thousand miles as possible between  himself and the tawny demon that had assaulted him.    \"Laddie!\" gasped the Mistress, unbelieving, as the policeman and most  of the little crowd set off after the fugitive. \"LADDIE! What in the  world--?\"    \"He--he must have been in the car, all the time,\" gabbled the Master,  brilliantly. \"He must have jumped in, while we were at breakfast. See,  he's cleared a space for himself between two of the bags. He's been  there, all the time, and we never--\"    \"If he hadn't been there,\" suggested the Mistress, \"we'd be looking now  for one or two pieces of luggage that had disappeared. When the Grays  went through here, one of their suitcases was--\"    \"But what in blazes are we going to do with him?\" broke in the Master,  worriedly. \"We can't take him all the way home. And I won't trust to  sending him by express. He might get backed onto a siding and be kept  there for days, without food or water. Besides, they won't let a dog go  by express unless he's in a crate. What are we to do?\"    \"Why,\" said the Mistress, stooping to stroke the silken head that  rested against her knee, \"Why, Laddie seems to have settled that for  us, by coming along. He's surely paid his way. We'll have to take him  the rest of the trip. The Harmons will be glad to see him, I'm sure.  Everybody's always glad to see Laddie, wherever we go. Let's take him.  It's the only thing to do. We can explain to them how it happened.\"    And so, after more discussion, it was settled. Even as most things had  a way of being settled when the Mistress proposed them.    Three hours later, the car stopped before the entrance of a roomily  beautiful house in a roomily beautiful residence park, in the upper  Catskills.    The welcoming smiles on the faces of host and hostess suffered sudden  eclipse; as a huge mahogany-and-white collie stepped majestically from  the car at the heels of the two guests.    \"This is Lad,\" introduced the Mistress. \"I hope you don't mind our  bringing him. I can promise he won't be a bit of trouble to anybody. We  didn't mean to bring him. It just happened. This was the way:--\"    While she was recounting the adventure to Mrs. Harmon, their host drew  the Master to one side.    \"Say, old man,\" began Harmon, with visible discomfort, \"please don't  misunderstand me or anything. But I'm a little bothered about just what  to do. This is the idea: There was a mad dog scare here in Daylight  Park, last month, when a Pom puppy snapped at some kids that were  teasing it. Then, a day or so later, a Persian cat had fits and chased  old Mrs. Cratchitt across a lawn and gave her a spell of palpitation of  the heart. And the next day an Angora goat that the Varian children had  as a pet got loose and chewed up several hundred dollars' worth of  lingerie off a line. Then the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],[0,"Dead Man's Land (#17)"],[1,"you a tale  like that without letting you know it was a bam-bam afterwards.\"    \"Ah, well, I'll believe you, Buck.  Ugh!  Listen!  What's that?  Did you  ever hear anything so horrible in your life!  Somebody's being killed.  There it is again!  There!\"        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    \"DON'T WAKE THE WRONG MAN.\"    \"What are you laughing at, Buck?\"    \"You, sir,\" cried the man.  \"You'll get more used to our noises in  time.\"    \"Then it's that horrible brute of a hyaena again.  What a doleful howl!  Sounds just as if it was crying after its mother.\"    \"But that isn't it, sir.  He's howling after his supper.\"    A short time after Mark caught sight of the doctor approaching, grasped  the sign he gave him, sprang up, and went to the waggon for his rifle,  which he carefully loaded, and then began his solitary watch, which  seemed less wearisome on this occasion as he paraded to and fro and  round and round in the silence of the sleeping camp.  Every now and then  he heard some startling sound, and ever and anon he listened to the  hyaena's wail, turning at times into what sounded like a mocking laugh.  Now and again too there was a cracked trumpet-like cry from the river,  but neither was this startling, as he had learned to know it as the call  of some night-hunting stork or crane.    Once or twice his finger went to the trigger of his piece involuntarily,  for it seemed to him that the loathsome animal that had hung about the  camp was creeping closer in search of food; but the fire just then  sprang up as the result of more fuel being thrown upon it, scaring away  the foul beast, for after a few words with the Hottentot and the  foreloper before they went back to their shelter beneath the leading  waggon, he heard the hyaena no more.    The next event that enlivened the wearisome watch was a visit from the  doctor, to whom the lad made his report, which was followed by a short  chat.    \"You won't be sorry to be relieved, Mark, my boy,\" he said.  \"You  remember, of course, that Peter Dance is to relieve you, so don't wake  the wrong man.\"    \"I shan't make any mistake,\" replied Mark confidently; and then he was  alone once more, taking a turn or two about the camp, listening to the  night cries again, and enjoying the confidence given to him by the  knowledge that there was nothing in them that he need fear.    For the most part he kept to one particular spot, where he could stand  and listen, at the same time keeping his eyes fixed upon the glowing  fire, comforted as it were by its social, friendly look as of a  companion which he could trust to ward off danger; and when he felt  disposed he could walk up to it near enough to let its light fall upon  the strong silver hunting watch whose case flew open at the pressure  upon the spring, perhaps not so often as might have happened under the  circumstances.    Somehow a sleeper accustomed to a certain duty is ruled by some natural  impulse to awaken almost to a minute if in the habit of rising to  perform that task, and here Mark roused himself from a train of dreamy  thought to make another journey towards the fire and bend down to look  at his watch.    \"Hurrah!\" he said to himself.  \"Ten minutes to two.  Just time to throw  on some wood, and rouse up old Peter.\"    He stood to listen for a minute or two, and then caught up one of the  rough armfuls of wood laid ready for the purpose, threw it on the fire,  and then hurried to the men's waggon and roused the keeper.    \"Who is it?  You, Mr Mark, sir?\"    \"Yes.  Jump up.\"    \"Where did you hear 'em?\" said the man.  \"In the long coppice, or down  by the ten acres?\"    \"Hear whom?\" said Mark.    \"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.  I was dreaming that I was at home and that  you had come to tell me that you had heard poachers.  All right, sir,\"  said the man, creeping into the shadow after getting his rifle.  \"You've  got the fire going, then?\"    \"Yes, but you had better throw on another armful soon.\"    \"Oh, yes, sir; all right.  All been quiet?\"    \"Yes, except that howling brute; but I haven't heard him for the last  hour.  You are quite awake, aren't you?\"    \"Awake, sir?  Oh, yes,\" said the man, shouldering his piece and walking  beside his young master to the other waggon.    \"Good-night,\" said Mark.  \"I can hardly keep my eyes open now.\"    \"Same here,\" muttered the man, as Mark climbed to his resting-place, so  heavily assailed by sleep that he was hardly conscious of his words.    Then all was silent but for the heavy breathing of the sleepers and an  occasional stamp from one of the picketed ponies.        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    A PRETTY DANCE.    It was not a feather-bed; there was neither bolster nor pillow; and a  single blanket laid across three sacks of Indian corn did not counteract  the hard nubbly feeling.  But a couple more blankets drawn over the lad  right up to his chin thoroughly kept off the crisp coolness of the air  on the high plateau of a country where the sun was broiling by day.  Youth, health, exercise and an open-air life did the rest to make that  sleeping place a perfect Elysium.    Add to the above a long watch in the darkness, and it is not surprising  that as Mark Roche stretched out his legs to the fullest extent as he  lay upon his back, he uttered a low, long, soft \"Hah-h-h!\" and the next  instant was fast asleep.    How long that lasted he could not tell, but he half awoke; better still,  one may say he only one quarter awoke bodily; mentally he was so to  speak soaked, saturated with sleep, and his waking was only into a kind  of confusion out of which he could not rouse himself.    All he knew was that something was dreadfully wrong--when--how--where--  he could not make out.    There was a great noise going on, and the darkness was something  horrible.  This seemed to last for a long time--seemed only, and he  began to struggle as if a heavy body was lying on him and pressing him  down.    It was like some terrible nightmare, and as he struggled against it he  threw out his arms, half fancying that he was fighting to save himself  from being suffocated in a flood that was not liquid but solid and hard.  Then one hand came in contact with something soft, which he realised to  be a human face, and then just a faint ray of understanding flashed  through his muddled brain and he knew where he was, and that the face  must be his cousin's.    Then the mental darkness closed in again and he was as confused as ever.  The noise went on, and he could not tell what it was till after a short  interval another ray of light dawned upon him and he caught at and shook  his companion, who was sharing the sacks, and sleeping so hard that  Mark's attempts to rouse him were in vain.    And then speech came, and the boy found himself muttering aloud, though  it seemed to be somebody else talking.  But now the power to put that  and that together to some extent grew stronger.    \"Oh, Dean, how you do sleep!\" came from somewhere.  \"Here, wake up!\"  And he grew a little better, for he felt that his lips were touching his  cousin's warm ear, while now it was another voice that said drowsily,  \"What's the matter?\"    \"Ah! that's better,\" the other voice ejaculated, and he heard it  plainly, though it was partially smothered by the awful confusion of  strange sounds that came as it were from a distance.  \"Oh, how dark!\"    And he knew now that it was his own voice, for he was rapidly shaking  off the strange feeling of mental torpidity.    \"Father!  Dr Robertson!  Are you there?\"    His words came back to him as if his face was covered with something  thick, while he fully grasped the idea now that the noise that smote his  ears was somewhere far away.    \"I don't know what's the matter,\" he muttered.  \"Am I ill?  It can't be  a dream.  Here, Dean, wake up!\"    \"What's the matter?\" came again drowsily.    \"I want you to listen.\"    \"Bother!  Will in the morning.\"    \"Oh, how can you be so stupid!\"    Mark was rapidly recovering now.    _Snore_!    \"Will you wake up?\"  And this was accompanied by a shake.    \"Be quiet!  Want me to hit you on the nose?\"    \"Yes, and I want you to shake me.  I'm--I'm--oh, I don't know how I  feel--yes, I do,\" added the boy, as the power of thinking and acting now  grew stronger.  \"Dean!\"    \"Oh, bother!\" cried his cousin.  \"Now then, what is it?\"  And in the  darkness Mark felt his hand shaken off, and from the movement knew that  his cousin had risen up into a sitting position sharply and banged  himself down again, the noise he made being followed instantly by a loud  snore.    \"Dean!\" cried Mark again, renewing his attack, and this time giving the  sleeper a violent shake, which roused him again.    \"Now then, what is it?\"    \"Listen!  Do you hear that dreadful noise?\"    \"No-o!\" came sleepily.  \"What is it?\"    The question was asked through two folds of blanket, and naturally  sounded woolly.    \"Lions, I think.\"    \"Tell them to lie down.\"    \"Oh, don't be such a fool!\"    \"Nogoinabe.  Wha' time is it?  Goo' night.\"    \"Dozey!  Oh, you sleepy old dormouse!  I am sure there is something  dreadful going on.  We are in danger.\"    \"Lem dange.  Here, tell the doctor.  Don' wake uncle, nor me.\"    \"Oh, dear, what shall I do!\" said Mark, half aloud.  \"Oh, my head!  My  head!  This must be--yes, I remember; I am in the waggon--here, Dean!  Dean!\"  And he began shaking his cousin again.    \"Don't!  Don't!\"  And there was the sound of the boy's bare feet  kicking, and a snatch made as if to draw back the blankets that had been  sent flying.  \"Oh, I will serve you out for--here, what do you want?\"    \"You to wake up.  Can't you see how dark it is?\"    \"Dark?\"    \"Yes; quite black.\"    Dean was wide awake now.    \"Yes, everything's as black as black.\"    \"Well, did you expect it to be white?\"    \"Can't you hear that dreadful noise?\"    \"Yes.  What is it?  Oh, I am so sleepy!  Uncle snoring.\"    \"There it is again!\" cried Mark wildly.    \"Well, I don't care,\" cried Dean"]]]
