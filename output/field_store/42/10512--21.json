Excavation would doubtless determine this, as the whole site  has been much filled up with sand and loose earth.    The second kiva, which was about the same size as the first, was  situated some little distance from the other, and on the outer edge of  the little platform or bench on which the settlement was located. It  still shows about half of its wall. The rectangular room near the main  kiva still stands to a height of 3 and 4 feet. The wall nearest the kiva  is pierced by a number of small openings, and by a neatly finished  double-notched doorway, which is illustrated in another place (figure  67).    The whole front of the site has been filled up to a probable depth of  several feet, and a number of Navaho burials have been made on it. These  are shown on the plan by shaded spots. Owing to the soft ground  underneath, it was easier to excavate a hole and wall it up than to  construct the regular surface cist, and the former plan was followed.    Although many of the sites are covered with bowlders and blocks of stone  fallen from above, which often occur among and even over walls, close  inspection generally shows that the walls were constructed after the  rocks fell. There are two instances, however, which are doubtful, and in  one (shown in figure 40) it appears that large blocks of rock have  fallen since the walls were constructed. Such falls of rock are not  uncommon now in the fall and winter months, when frost and seepage from  the melting snow sometimes split off huge fragments.      [Illustration: Fig. 39--Ground plan of a ruin in Canyon de Chelly.]    The site mentioned occurs at the point marked 47 on the map. It is in a  cove under a mass of rock which juts out from the cliff, and is about 30  feet above the bottom, on the edge of a slope of loose rock which  extends some distance above it. At the top of the talus, over 200 feet  above, there is another ruin, which was probably only an outlook, as no  trace of a kiva can be found, and it is possible that the lower site was  connected with and formed part of the upper one. The lower site  contained a circular kiva, only a small portion of which now remains,  and the ground is covered with blocks of rock which must have fallen  since the walls were built. They appear to have fallen quite recently.  It can still be seen that the kiva had an interior bench, and that there  was a room, or perhaps rooms, between it and the back of the cove; but  beyond this nothing can now be made out.      [Illustration: Fig. 40--Site showing recent fall of rock.]    There are many favorable sites in the branch canyons, but not many of  them are occupied, possibly because in the upper parts of these canyons  the bottom land is of small area and is sometimes rough, being composed  of numerous small hillocks. The flat bottom lands of the canyon proper  are much easier to cultivate, but the sites in the side canyons offered  much better facilities for defense. Figure 41 shows the plan of a ruin  which occurs at the point marked 69 on the map, on the western side of a  branch canyon through which passes the trail to Fort Defiance. It is  situated in a shallow cove at the top of the talus and overlooks an  extensive area of fine bottom land below it. At the eastern end there is  a single room about 10 feet long; its front wall extends up to the  overhanging rock, which forms the roof of the room. A small cist has  been built against it on the west.      [Illustration: Fig. 41--Ruin No. 69, in a branch canyon.]    About 60 feet west, on the same ledge, there are remains of other rooms  which rested probably on the talus. Several rooms can be made out, but  only one shows standing walls. This is on the western end, and the walls  are now about 5 feet high. Four feet from the top of the wall there is a  clear line of demarcation extending horizontally across it. Below this  line the masonry consists of large flat slabs of rock laid in mud  mortar, which was used nearly dry and stuffed into the cracks to some  extent. Above the line the stones were carefully selected and the work  was well done, the whole being finished by a thin coat of plaster. There  is no opening in the lower part, but in the upper part there is a neatly  finished doorway 3 feet high and slightly tapering. The bottom of this  opening extends 2 inches below the line, and the lintel is composed of a  large slab of stone a trifle wider than the thickness of the wall, but  fitted flush on the outside.      [Illustration: Fig. 42--Ground plan of a small ruin in Canyon del    Muerto.]    On a bench about 100 feet higher than the ruin described there are two  small rooms, extending up to the overhanging rock above them. These  rooms, which may be of Navaho origin, were reached by means of a narrow  ledge extending from the top of a slope of loose rock and debris about  300 yards to the southward, or up the canyon.    Figure 42 is a ground plan of a small ruin in Del Muerto in which the  usual preponderance of rectangular rooms is illustrated. The site was  restricted, but there is an apparent attempt to carry out the usual  arrangement of a row of rooms against the cliff, with a kiva in front.  Probably only three of the rooms shown were used as habitations. The  plan of the kiva, which occurs in the center, was somewhat marred by a  large bowlder, which must have projected into it, but apparently no  attempt was made to dress off the projecting point.      [Illustration: Fig. 43--Ground plan of a small ruin.]    Figure 43 is the plan of a ruin located on a more open site. Only a few  walls now remain, but there is no doubt that at one time more of the  site was covered than now appears. There are remains of two, and perhaps  of three, circular kivas.      [Illustration: Fig. 44--Plan of a ruin with curved inclosing wall.]    Figure 44 shows a ruin in which the plan is somewhat more elaborated.  There are remains of several well-defined rooms, and two kivas are still  fairly well preserved. The ledge is narrow and the rooms are stretched  along it, with kivas at either end. That on the east was benched nearly  all around its interior, and the outside inclosing wall, on the east,  apparently follows the curve. An example in which this feature occurs  has been mentioned above (page 138). It is very rare, but in this case  the evidence is clearer than in the one previously described. The  western kiva, somewhat smaller than the other, was also benched, and had  an exterior shaft, like those mentioned above and later described at  length.      [Illustration: Fig. 45--Ground plan of ruin No. 34.]    Figure 45 is a plan of a small ruin of the same type, which occurs in  the middle region of De Chelly. It occupies the site marked 34 on the  map, and is situated in a niche in a deep cove, where the outlook is  almost completely obscured by a large sand dune in front of it. It  comprised one circular kiva and four rectangular rooms, but, contrary to  the usual result, the latter are fairly well preserved, while the former  is almost completely obliterated. This may be due to the use of the  rectangular rooms as sites for Navaho burial cists, of which there are  no fewer than six here, and possibly the kiva walls furnished the  necessary building material for the construction of the cists. The old  masonry is of good quality, the outside wall being formed of selected  stones of medium size, well laid and carefully chinked. Most of the  walls were plastered inside. In a cleft in the rock to the right of this  ruin there is a kind of cave, with foot-holes leading up the rock to it,  and quite difficult of access. It formerly may have been used for  storage, but at present contains only some remains of Navaho burials.      IV--CLIFF OUTLOOKS OR FARMING SHELTERS    Ruins comprised in the class of cliff outlooks, or farming shelters, are  by far the most numerous in the canyon. They were located on various  kinds of sites, but always with reference to some area of cultivable  land which they overlooked, and seldom, if ever, was the site selected  under the influence of the defensive motive. It is not to be understood  that such motive was wholly absent; it may have been present in some  cases, but the dominating motive was always convenience to some adjacent  area of cultivable land.    The separation of this class of ruins from the preceding village ruins,  while clear and definite enough in the main, is far from absolute. The  sole criterion we have is the presence or absence of the kiva, as the  sites occupied are essentially the same; but this test is in a general  way sufficient. It is possible that in certain cases the kiva is so far  obliterated as to be no longer distinguishable, but the number of cases  in which this might have occurred is comparatively small. The kivas, as  a rule, were more solidly constructed than the other rooms, and, as the  preceding ground plans show, sometimes survived when the rectangular  rooms connected with them have entirely disappeared.      [Illustration: Fig. 46--Ground plan of cliff outlook No. 35.]    Figure 46 is the plan of an outlook in the same cove as the last example  of village ruin illustrated, and only 200 or 300 yards south of it. It  may have been connected with that ruin, but could not in itself have  been a village, as there are no traces of a kiva on the site, and hardly  room enough for one on the bench proper. At the extreme northern end  there are traces of walls on the rocks at a lower level.      [Illustration: Fig. 47--Plan of a cliff outlook.]    The walls which were at right angles to the cliff were not carried back  to it after the usual manner, but stopped about 3 feet from it, and the  rooms were closed by a back wall running parallel to the cliff, and  about 3 feet from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#17)"],[1,"impassivity, for  Evarin smiled. \"Now you know, Rakhal, why I am called Toymaker. Is it  not strange--the masterpriest of Nebran, a maker of Toys, and the shrine  of the Toad God a workshop for children's playthings?\"    Evarin paused suggestively. They were obviously not children's  playthings and this was my cue to say so, but I avoided the trap. Evarin  opened a sliding panel and took out a doll.    She was perhaps the length of my longest finger, molded to the precise  proportions of a woman, and costumed after the bizarre fashion of the  Ardcarran dancing girls. Evarin touched no button or key that I could  see, but when he set the figure on its feet, it executed a whirling,  armtossing dance in a fast, tricky tempo.    \"I am, in a sense, benevolent,\" Evarin murmured. He snapped his fingers  and the doll sank to her knees and poised there, silent. \"Moreover, I  have the means and, let us say, the ability to indulge my small  fantasies.    \"The little daughter of the President of the Federation of Trade Cities  on Samarra was sent such a doll recently. What a pity that Paolo  Arimengo was so suddenly impeached and banished!\" The Toymaker clucked  his teeth commiseratingly. \"Perhaps this small companion will compensate  the little Carmela for her adjustment to her new ... position.\"    He replaced the dancer and pulled down something like a whirligig. \"This  might interest you,\" he mused, and set it spinning. I stared at the  pattern of lights that flowed and disappeared, melting in and out of  visible shadows. Suddenly I realized what the thing was doing. I  wrested my eyes away with an effort. Had there been a lapse of seconds  or minutes? Had Evarin spoken?    Evarin arrested the compelling motion with one finger. \"Several of these  pretty playthings are available to the children of important men,\" he  said absently. \"An import of value for our exploited and impoverished  world. Unfortunately they are, perhaps, a little ... ah, obvious. The  incidence of nervous breakdowns is, ah, interfering with their sale. The  children, of course, are unaffected, and love them.\" Evarin set the  hypnotic wheel moving again, glanced sidewise at me, then set it  carefully back.    \"Now\"--Evarin's voice, hard with the silkiness of a cat's snarl, clawed  the silence--\"we'll talk business.\"    I turned, composing my face. Evarin had something concealed in one hand,  but I didn't think it was a weapon. And if I'd known, I'd have had to  ignore it anyway.    \"Perhaps you wonder how we recognized and found you?\" A panel cleared in  the wall and became translucent. Confused flickers moved, dropped into  focus and I realized that the panel was an ordinary television screen  and I was looking into the well-known interior of the Cafe of Three  Rainbows in the Trade City of Charin.    By this time I was running low on curiosity and didn't wonder till much,  much later how televised pictures were transmitted around the curve of a  planet. Evarin sharpened the focus down on the long Earth-type bar where  a tall man in Terran clothes was talking to a pale-haired girl. Evarin  said, \"By now, Race Cargill has decided, no doubt, that you fell into  his trap and into the hands of the Ya-men. He is off-guard now.\"    And suddenly the whole thing seemed so unbearably, illogically funny  that my shoulders shook with the effort to keep back dangerous laughter.  Since I'd landed in Charin, I'd taken great pains to avoid the Trade  City, or anyone who might have associated me with it. And Rakhal,  somehow aware of this, had conveniently filled up the gap. By posing as  me.    It wasn't nearly as difficult as it sounded. I had found that out in  Shainsa. Charin is a long, long way from the major Trade City near the  Kharsa. I hadn't a single intimate friend there, or within hundreds of  miles, to see through the imposture. At most, there were half a dozen of  the staff that I'd once met, or had a drink with, eight or ten years  ago.    Rakhal could speak perfect Standard when he chose; if he lapsed into  Dry-town idiom, that too was in my known character. I had no doubt he  was making a great success of it all, probably doing much better with my  identity than I could ever have done with his.    Evarin rasped, \"Cargill meant to leave the planet. What stopped him? You  could be of use to us, Rakhal. But not with this blood-feud unsettled.\"    That needed no elucidation. No Wolfan in his right mind will bargain  with a Dry-towner carrying an unresolved blood-feud. By law and custom,  declared blood-feud takes precedence over any other business, public or  private, and is sufficient excuse for broken promises, neglected duties,  theft, even murder.    \"We want it settled once and for all.\" Evarin's voice was low and  unhurried. \"And we aren't above weighting the scales. This Cargill can,  and has, posed as a Dry-towner, undetected. We don't like Earthmen who  can do that. In settling your feud, you will be aiding us, and removing  a danger. We would be ... grateful.\"    He opened his closed hand, displaying something small, curled, inert.    \"Every living thing emits a characteristic pattern of electrical nerve  impulses. We have ways of recording those impulses, and we have had you  and Cargill under observation for a long time. We've had plenty of  opportunity to key this Toy to Cargill's pattern.\"    On his palm the curled thing stirred, spread wings. A fledgling bird lay  there, small soft body throbbing slightly. Half-hidden in a ruff of  metallic feathers I glimpsed a grimly elongated beak. The pinions were  feathered with delicate down less than a quarter of an inch long. They  beat with delicate insistence against the Toymaker's prisoning fingers.    \"This is not dangerous to you. Press here\"--he showed me--\"and if Race  Cargill is within a certain distance--and it is up to you to be _within_  that distance--it will find him, and kill him. Unerringly, inescapably,  untraceably. We will not tell you the critical distance. And we will  give you three days.\"    He checked my startled exclamation with a gesture. \"Of course this is a  test. Within the hour Cargill will receive a warning. We want no  incompetents who must be helped too much! Nor do we want cowards! If you  fail, or release the bird at a distance too great, or evade the  test\"--the green inhuman malice in his eyes made me sweat--\"we have made  another bird.\"    By now my brain was swimming, but I thought I understood the complex  inhuman logic involved. \"The other bird is keyed to me?\"    With slow contempt Evarin shook his head. \"You? You are used to danger  and fond of a gamble. Nothing so simple! We have given you three days.  If, within that time, the bird you carry has not killed, the other bird  will fly. And it will kill. Rakhal, you have a wife.\"    Yes, Rakhal had a wife. They could threaten Rakhal's wife. And his wife  was my sister Juli.    Everything after that was anticlimax. Of course I had to drink with  Evarin, the elaborate formal ritual without which no bargain on Wolf is  concluded. He entertained me with gory and technical descriptions of the  way in which the birds, and other of his hellish Toys, did their  killing, and worse tasks.    Miellyn danced into the room and upset the exquisite solemnity of the  wine-ritual by perching on my knee, stealing a sip from my cup, and  pouting prettily when I paid her less attention than she thought she  merited. I didn't dare pay much attention, even when she whispered, with  the deliberate and thorough wantonness of a Dry-town woman of high-caste  who has flung aside her fetters, something about a rendezvous at the  Three Rainbows.    But eventually it was over and I stepped through a door that twisted  with a giddy blankness, and found myself outside a bare windowless wall  in Charin again, the night sky starred and cold. The acrid smell of the  Ghost Wind was thinning in the streets, but I had to crouch in a cranny  of the wall when a final rustling horde of Ya-men, the last of their  receding tide, rustled down the street. I found my way to my lodging in  a filthy _chak_ hostel, and threw myself down on the verminous bed.    Believe it or not, I slept.          CHAPTER TWELVE      An hour before dawn there was a noise in my room. I roused, my hand on  my skean. Someone or something was fumbling under the mattress where I  had thrust Evarin's bird. I struck out, encountered something warm and  breathing, and grappled with it in the darkness. A foul-smelling  something gripped over my mouth. I tore it away and struck hard with the  skean. There was a high shrilling. The gripping filth loosened and fell  away and something died on the floor.    I struck a light, retching in revulsion. It hadn't been human. There  wouldn't have been that much blood from a human. Not that color, either.    The _chak_ who ran the place came and gibbered at me. _Chaks_ have a  horror of blood and this one gave me to understand that my lease was up  then and there, no arguments, no refunds. He wouldn't even let me go  into his stone outbuilding to wash the foul stuff from my shirtcloak. I  gave up and fished under the mattress for Evarin's Toy.    The _chak_ got a glimpse of the embroideries on the silk in which it was  wrapped, and stood back, his loose furry lips hanging open, while I  gathered my few belongings together and strode out of the room. He would  not touch the coins I offered; I laid them on a chest and he let them  lie there, and as I went into the reddening morning they came flying  after me into the street.    I pulled the silk from the Toy and tried to make some sense from my  predicament. The little thing lay innocent and silent in my palm. It  wouldn't tell me whether it had been keyed to me, the real Cargill, some  time in the past, or to Rakhal, using my name and reputation in the  Terran Colony here at Charin.    If I pressed the stud it might play out this comedy of errors by hunting  down Rakhal, and all my"]]]
