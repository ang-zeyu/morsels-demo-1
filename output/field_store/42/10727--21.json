This very morning I sat on the  spot where, a few days ago, you descended from the carriage, and--\" She  immediately changed the subject to prevent me from pursuing it farther.  My dear friend, my energies are all prostrated: she can do with me what  she pleases.    NOVEMBER 15.    I thank you, Wilhelm, for your cordial sympathy, for your excellent  advice; and I implore you to be quiet. Leave me to my sufferings. In  spite of my wretchedness, I have still strength enough for endurance.  I revere religion--you know I do. I feel that it can impart strength  to the feeble and comfort to the afflicted, but does it affect all men  equally? Consider this vast universe: you will see thousands for whom it  has never existed, thousands for whom it will never exist, whether it be  preached to them, or not; and must it, then, necessarily exist for me?  Does not the Son of God himself say that they are his whom the Father  has given to him? Have I been given to him? What if the Father will  retain me for himself, as my heart sometimes suggests? I pray you, do  not misinterpret this. Do not extract derision from my harmless words. I  pour out my whole soul before you. Silence were otherwise preferable to  me, but I need not shrink from a subject of which few know more than I  do myself. What is the destiny of man, but to fill up the measure of  his sufferings, and to drink his allotted cup of bitterness? And if that  same cup proved bitter to the God of heaven, under a human form, why  should I affect a foolish pride, and call it sweet? Why should I be  ashamed of shrinking at that fearful moment, when my whole being will  tremble between existence and annihilation, when a remembrance of  the past, like a flash of lightning, will illuminate the dark gulf of  futurity, when everything shall dissolve around me, and the whole world  vanish away? Is not this the voice of a creature oppressed beyond all  resource, self-deficient, about to plunge into inevitable destruction,  and groaning deeply at its inadequate strength, \"My God! my God! why  hast thou forsaken me?\" And should I feel ashamed to utter the same  expression? Should I not shudder at a prospect which had its fears, even  for him who folds up the heavens like a garment?    NOVEMBER 21.    She does not feel, she does not know, that she is preparing a poison  which will destroy us both; and I drink deeply of the draught which is  to prove my destruction. What mean those looks of kindness with which  she often--often? no, not often, but sometimes, regards me, that  complacency with which she hears the involuntary sentiments which  frequently escape me, and the tender pity for my sufferings which  appears in her countenance?    Yesterday, when I took leave she seized me by the hand, and said,  \"Adieu, dear Werther.\" Dear Werther! It was the first time she ever  called me dear: the sound sunk deep into my heart. I have repeated it a  hundred times; and last night, on going to bed, and talking to myself  of various things, I suddenly said, \"Good night, dear Werther!\" and then  could not but laugh at myself.    NOVEMBER 22    I cannot pray, \"Leave her to me!\" and yet she often seems to belong to  me. I cannot pray, \"Give her to me!\" for she is another's. In this way  I affect mirth over my troubles; and, if I had time, I could compose a  whole litany of antitheses.    NOVEMBER 24.    She is sensible of my sufferings. This morning her look pierced my very  soul. I found her alone, and she was silent: she steadfastly surveyed  me. I no longer saw in her face the charms of beauty or the fire of  genius: these had disappeared. But I was affected by an expression much  more touching, a look of the deepest sympathy and of the softest pity.  Why was I afraid to throw myself at her feet? Why did I not dare to take  her in my arms, and answer her by a thousand kisses? She had recourse to  her piano for relief, and in a low and sweet voice accompanied the music  with delicious sounds. Her lips never appeared so lovely: they seemed  but just to open, that they might imbibe the sweet tones which issued  from the instrument, and return the heavenly vibration from her lovely  mouth. Oh! who can express my sensations? I was quite overcome, and,  bending down, pronounced this vow: \"Beautiful lips, which the angels  guard, never will I seek to profane your purity with a kiss.\" And  yet, my friend, oh, I wish--but my heart is darkened by doubt and  indecision--could I but taste felicity, and then die to expiate the sin!  What sin?    NOVEMBER 26.    Oftentimes I say to myself, \"Thou alone art wretched: all other mortals  are happy, none are distressed like thee!\" Then I read a passage in an  ancient poet, and I seem to understand my own heart. I have so much to  endure! Have men before me ever been so wretched?    NOVEMBER 30.    I shall never be myself again! Wherever I go, some fatality occurs to  distract me. Even to-day alas--for our destiny! alas for human nature!    About dinner-time I went to walk by the river-side, for I had no  appetite. Everything around seemed gloomy: a cold and damp easterly wind  blew from the mountains, and black, heavy clouds spread over the plain.  I observed at a distance a man in a tattered coat: he was wandering  among the rocks, and seemed to be looking for plants. When I approached,  he turned round at the noise; and I saw that he had an interesting  countenance in which a settled melancholy, strongly marked by  benevolence, formed the principal feature. His long black hair was  divided, and flowed over his shoulders. As his garb betokened a person  of the lower order, I thought he would not take it ill if I inquired  about his business; and I therefore asked what he was seeking. He  replied, with a deep sigh, that he was looking for flowers, and could  find none. \"But it is not the season,\" I observed, with a smile. \"Oh,  there are so many flowers!\" he answered, as he came nearer to me. \"In my  garden there are roses and honeysuckles of two sorts: one sort was  given to me by my father! they grow as plentifully as weeds; I have been  looking for them these two days, and cannot find them. There are flowers  out there, yellow, blue, and red; and that centaury has a very pretty  blossom: but I can find none of them.\" I observed his peculiarity, and  therefore asked him, with an air of indifference, what he intended to  do with his flowers. A strange smile overspread his countenance. Holding  his finger to his mouth, he expressed a hope that I would not betray  him; and he then informed me that he had promised to gather a nosegay  for his mistress. \"That is right,\" said I. \"Oh!\" he replied, \"she  possesses many other things as well: she is very rich.\" \"And yet,\" I  continued, \"she likes your nosegays.\" \"Oh, she has jewels and crowns!\"  he exclaimed. I asked who she was. \"If the states-general would but pay  me,\" he added, \"I should be quite another man. Alas! there was a time  when I was so happy; but that is past, and I am now--\" He raised his  swimming eyes to heaven. \"And you were happy once?\" I observed. \"Ah,  would I were so still!\" was his reply. \"I was then as gay and contented  as a man can be.\" An old woman, who was coming toward us, now called  out, \"Henry, Henry! where are you? We have been looking for you  everywhere: come to dinner.\" \"Is he your son?\" I inquired, as I went  toward her. \"Yes,\" she said: \"he is my poor, unfortunate son. The Lord  has sent me a heavy affliction.\" I asked whether he had been long in  this state. She answered, \"He has been as calm as he is at present for  about six months. I thank Heaven that he has so far recovered: he was  for one whole year quite raving, and chained down in a madhouse. Now he  injures no one, but talks of nothing else than kings and queens. He used  to be a very good, quiet youth, and helped to maintain me; he wrote a  very fine hand; but all at once he became melancholy, was seized with a  violent fever, grew distracted, and is now as you see. If I were only to  tell you, sir--\" I interrupted her by asking what period it was in which  he boasted of having been so happy. \"Poor boy!\" she exclaimed, with a  smile of compassion, \"he means the time when he was completely deranged,  a time he never ceases to regret, when he was in the madhouse, and  unconscious of everything.\" I was thunderstruck: I placed a piece of  money in her hand, and hastened away.    \"You were happy!\" I exclaimed, as I returned quickly to the town, \"'as  gay and contented as a man can be!'\" God of heaven! and is this the  destiny of man? Is he only happy before he has acquired his reason, or  after he has lost it? Unfortunate being! And yet I envy your fate: I  envy the delusion to which you are a victim. You go forth with joy to  gather flowers for your princess,--in winter,--and grieve when you can  find none, and cannot understand why they do not grow. But I wander  forth without joy, without hope, without design; and I return as I came.  You fancy what a man you would be if the states general paid you. Happy  mortal, who can ascribe your wretchedness to an earthly cause! You  do not know, you do not feel, that in your own distracted heart and  disordered brain dwells the source of that unhappiness which all the  potentates on earth cannot relieve.    Let that man die unconsoled who can deride the invalid for undertaking  a journey to distant, healthful springs, where he often finds only a  heavier disease and a more painful death, or who can exult over the  despairing mind of a sinner, who, to obtain peace of conscience and an  alleviation of misery, makes a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre. Each  laborious step which galls his wounded feet in rough and untrodden paths  pours a drop of balm into his troubled soul, and the journey of many a  weary day brings a nightly relief to his anguished heart.

The natural  conformation of the land will rouse the ingenuity of our young  architects, whose ideas have not yet been cramped by routine; and even  if the people do not grasp the whole import of the plan, they will at  any rate feel at ease in their loose clusters. The Temple will be  visible from long distances, for it is only our ancient faith that has  kept us together. There will be light, attractive, healthy schools for  children, conducted on the most approved modern systems. There will be  continuation-schools for workmen, which will educate them in greater  technical knowledge and enable them to become intimate with the  working of machinery. There will be places of amusement for the proper  conduct of which the Society of Jews will be responsible.    We are, however, speaking merely of the buildings at present, and not  of what may take place inside of them.    I said that the Company would build workmen's dwellings cheaply. And  cheaply, not only because of the proximity of abundant building  materials, not only because of the Company's proprietorship of the  sites, but also because of the non-payment of workmen.    American farmers work on the system of mutual assistance in the  construction of houses. This childishly amicable system, which is as  clumsy as the block-houses erected, can be developed on much finer  lines.      UNSKILLED LABORERS    Our unskilled laborers, who will come at first from the great  reservoirs of Russia and Rumania, must, of course, render each other  assistance, in the construction of houses. They will be obliged to  build with wood in the beginning, because iron will not be immediately  available. Later on the original, inadequate, makeshift buildings will  be replaced by superior dwellings.    Our unskilled laborers will first mutually erect these shelters; and  then they will earn their houses as permanent possessions by means of  their work--not immediately, but after three years of good conduct. In  this way we shall secure energetic and able men, and these men will be  practically trained for life by three years of labor under good  discipline.    I said before that the Company would not have to pay these unskilled  laborers. What will they live on?    On the whole, I am opposed to the Truck system,[A] but it will have to  be applied in the case of these first settlers. The Company provides  for them in so many ways, that it may take charge of their  maintenance. In any case the Truck system will be enforced only during  the first few years, and it will benefit the workmen by preventing  their being exploited by small traders, landlords, etc. The Company  will thus make it impossible from the outset for those of our people,  who are perforce hawkers and peddlers here, to reestablish themselves  in the same trades over there. And the Company will also keep back  drunkards and dissolute men. Then will there be no payment of wages at  all during the first period of settlement. Certainly, there will be  wages for overtime.      THE SEVEN-HOUR DAY    The seven-hour day is the regular working day.    This does not imply that wood-cutting, digging, stone-breaking, and a  hundred other daily tasks should only be performed during seven hours.  Indeed not. There will be fourteen hours of labor, work being done in  shifts of three and a half hours. The organization of all this will be  military in character; there will be commands, promotions and  pensions, the means by which these pensions are provided being  explained further on.    A sound man can do a great deal of concentrated work in three and a  half hours. After an interval of the same length of time--which he  will devote to rest, to his family, and to his education under  guidance--he will be quite fresh for work again. Such labor can do  wonders.    The seven-hour day thus implies fourteen hours of joint labor--more  than that cannot be put into a day.    I am convinced that it is quite possible to introduce this seven-hour  day with success. The attempts to do so in Belgium and England are  well known. Some advanced political economists who have studied the  subject, declare that a five-hour day would suffice. The Society of  Jews and the Jewish Company will, in any case, make new and extensive  experiments which will benefit the other nations of the world; and if  the seven-hour day proves itself practicable, it will be introduced in  our future State as the legal and regular working day.    Meantime, the Company will always allow its employees the seven-hour  day; and it will always be in a position to do so.    The seven-hour day will be the call to summon our people in every part  of the world. All must come voluntarily, for ours must indeed be the  Promised Land....    Whoever works longer than seven hours receives his additional pay for  overtime in cash. Seeing that all his needs are supplied, and that  those members of his family who are unable to work are provided for by  transplanted and centralized philanthropic institutions, he can save a  little money. Thrift, which is already a characteristic of our people,  should be greatly encouraged, because it will, in the first place,  facilitate the rise of individuals to higher grades; and secondly, the  money saved will provide an immense reserve fund for future loans.  Overtime will only be permitted on a doctor's certificate, and must  not exceed three hours. For our men will crowd to work in the new  country, and the world will see then what an industrious people we  are.    I shall not describe the mode of carrying out the Truck system, nor,  in fact, the innumerable details of any process, for fear of confusing  my readers. Women will not be allowed to perform any arduous labor,  nor to work overtime.    Pregnant women will be relieved of all work, and will be supplied with  nourishing food by the Truck. We want our future generations to be  strong men and women.    We shall educate children as we wish from the commencement; but this I  shall not elaborate either.    My remarks on workmen's dwellings, and on unskilled laborers and their  mode of life, are no more Utopian than the rest of my scheme.  Everything I have spoken of is already being put into practice, only  on an utterly small scale, neither noticed nor understood. The  \"Assistance par le Travail,\" which I learned to know and understand in  Paris, was of great service to me in the solution of the Jewish  question.      RELIEF BY LABOR    The system of relief by labor which, is now applied in Paris, in many  other French towns, in England, in Switzerland, and in America, is a  very small thing, but capable of the greatest expansion.    What is the principle of relief by labor?    The principle is: to furnish every needy man with easy, unskilled  work, such as chopping wood, or cutting faggots used for lighting  stoves in Paris households. This is a kind of prison-work before the  crime, done without loss of character. It is meant to prevent men from  taking to crime out of want, by providing them with work and testing  their willingness to do it. Starvation must never be allowed to drive  men to suicide; for such suicides are the deepest disgrace to a  civilization which allows rich men to throw tid-bits to their dogs.    Relief by labor thus provides every one with work. But the system has  a great defect; there is not a sufficiently large demand for the  production of the unskilled workers employed, hence there is a loss to  those who employ them; though it is true that the organization is  philanthropic, and therefore prepared for loss. But here the  benefaction lies only in the difference between the price paid for the  work and its actual value. Instead of giving the beggar two sous, the  institution supplies him with work on which it loses two sous. But at  the same time it converts the good-for-nothing beggar into an honest  breadwinner, who has earned perhaps 1 franc 50 centimes. 150 centimes  for 10! That is to say, the receiver of a benefaction in which there  is nothing humiliating has increased it fifteenfold! That is to say,  fifteen thousand millions for one thousand millions!    The institution certainly loses 10 centimes. But the Jewish Company  will not lose one thousand millions; it will draw enormous profits  from this expenditure.    There is a moral side also. The small system of relief by labor which  exists now preserves rectitude through industry till such time as the  man who is out of work finds a post suitable to his capacities, either  in his old calling or in a new one. He is allowed a few hours daily  for the purpose of looking for a place, in which task the institutions  assist him.    The defect of these small organizations, so far, has been that they  have been prohibited from entering into competition with timber  merchants, etc. Timber merchants are electors; they would protest, and  would be justified in protesting. Competition with State prison-labor  has also been forbidden, for the State must occupy and feed its  criminals.    In fact, there is very little room in an old-established society for  the successful application of the system of \"Assistance par le  Travail.\"    But there is room in a new society.    For, above all, we require enormous numbers of unskilled laborers to  do the first rough work of settlement, to lay down roads, plant trees,  level the ground, construct railroads, telegraph installations, etc.  All this will be carried out in accordance with a large and previously  settled plan.      COMMERCE    The labor carried to the new country will naturally create trade. The  first markets will supply only the absolute necessities of life;  cattle, grain, working "]]]
