Who in their sane  senses would ask you to compare a warrior king with old Miss Yonge?  A  little reflection would have saved you from the pitfall into which you  have all fallen headlong.  Five bad marks each!  Now, then, for the next  two.  What have you got to say about the two Joes?\"    Very little apparently.  No one had tackled the comparison in Rhoda's  grandiose fashion, but a few pithy sentences were to be found scribbled  on the sides of exercise books.  \"Jo March was very clever, and my  father says Mr Chamberlain is, too!\" from one dutiful pupil.  \"Jo March  was a darling, and Chamberlain is not,\" from another of Radical  principles.  \"Both wore eye-glasses, and wrote things for magazines,\"  and other such exhaustive criticisms.    \"You are _all_ plucked in Literature,\" announced Thomasina, solemnly,  \"and I am deeply pained by the exhibition!  I will give you one more  chance in Arithmetic before going on to the higher branches, because, as  you are aware, this is a most vital and important subject.  Write down,  please: A and B each inherited thirty thousand pounds.  A invested his  capital in gold-mine shares to bring in eighteen per cent, interest.  B  put his money into the Post Office Savings Bank, and received two and a  half per cent.  State to three places in decimals the respective wealth  of each at the expiration of twenty-seven years!\"    \"Er--with what deduction for current expenses?\" queried Irene, with an  air.  She had been snubbed once, but was not in the least subdued.  \"What were their current expenses?\"    \"There were none!\"    \"Thomasina, what bosh!  There _must_ have been.  They couldn't live on  nothing.\"    \"Well, they did, then.  Since you are so particular, I may tell you that  they were in prison!  They had their wants supplied by their native  land.\"    \"I'm not going to do sums about convicts!  My mother wouldn't like it,\"  said Dorothy, shutting up her book with a bang.  She leaned forward, and  whispered in Rhoda's ear, \"Don't bother; it's only another joke.  What's  the use of worrying for nothing?\"    \"It's practice,\" said Rhoda, and away went her pencil, scribbling,  calculating, piling up row upon row of figures.  To her joy the answer  came out the same as Irene's, which surely must prove it right; yet, as  Dorothy had prophesied, Tom was once more sweeping in denunciation,  \"Wrong!  Wrong!  All wrong!  The gold-mine failed, and left A a pauper,  while B lived happily ever after.  You are old enough to know that gold-  mines that pay eighteen per cent, invariably _do_ fail and ruin their  shareholders; or if you don't, you may be thankful to me for telling  you.  I must say, young ladies, you are coming exceedingly poorly  through my test.  I cannot congratulate you on your insight.  I doubt  whether it is any use examining you any further.\"    \"Oh, yes, let us have the higher branches, Tom!  Do let us have the  higher branches!  Who knows?  Perhaps we may distinguish ourselves at  last.  Give us another chance!\" pleaded the girls, mockingly; and, thus  challenged, Tom could not but consent.  She tackled Zoology, and giving  the three divisions of Plantigrada, Pinnigrada, and Digitigrada, added a  list of animals to be classified accordingly.  When it is said that the  list included such widely diverging creatures as \"A camel-leopard, a  duck-billed platypus, Thomasina Bolderston, and Spring-heeled Jack,\" it  can be imagined with what zest the pupils began their replies.    Tom professed to be mortified beyond endurance to find her fairy tread  unanimously classed under the first heading, and begged the Blues to  take notice that if any girl pined to call her \"splay-footed\" to her  face she might do so, and take the consequences!  No one accepted the  challenge, however; so she proceeded to Latin, and, with much jingling  of keys, gave out a sentence for translation:--    \"Aequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem.\"  The girls smiled at  this, confident of their powers.  The students at Hurst prided  themselves on their Latin, and could have stood a much severer test  without wavering.  The seniors did not trouble to write their answers,  but waited complacently until the time came when they should have an  opportunity of airing their proficiency.  It never came, however, for  Tom chose to disappoint expectations by reading aloud her own  translation from her position in front of the fire.    \"Memento--remember; mentem--and mind; servare--to hold up; aequam--your  mare; in rebus arduis--going up hill.  That translation, young ladies,  was given by an undergraduate in the University of Oxford.  He  afterwards rowed stroke in the 'Varsity boat, and was the best billiard  player of his year, so it would ill become us to dispute his  conclusions.  You will observe the valuable moral lessons inculcated in  the words, and, I trust, take them to heart--`Remember and mind--'\"    A laugh sounded from the direction of the door, and there stood Miss  Everett, looking round with mischievous eyes.  Rhoda noted with relief  that she looked brighter than for days past, as if some good news had  arrived from the home about which she was so anxious.    \"This sounds improving,\" she cried, merrily.  \"Thomasina holding a Latin  class!  I am glad you have found such an exemplary way of passing the  afternoon.  I am afraid you must stop, however, as the gong will ring in  five minutes, and meantime I must break up the class.  I want,\"--her eye  roved enquiringly round the room--\"I want Rhoda!\"    \"Certainly, Miss Everett.  Anything to oblige you.  Rhoda, my love, you  have my permission to retire,\" drawled Thomasina, wagging her head in  languid assent, and Rhoda left the room in no little wonder as to the  reason of the summons.    Arrived in the corridor, Miss Everett laid both hands on the girl's  shoulders, and asked a quick, laughing question:--    \"What about that hamper?\"    \"Hamper?\" echoed Rhoda.  \"Hamper?\"  Her air of bewilderment was so  unaffectedly genuine that the other's expression became in turn doubtful  and uncertain.    \"Yes, yes, the hamper!  The hamper of good things that has just arrived  for my brother.  I thought you--\"    \"I know nothing about it; truly I don't!  I wish I did, but--\"    \"But, my dear girl, it came from your home.  There was a game label upon  it, with your father's name in print--`From Henry Chester, Erley Chase.'  There cannot be two Henry Chesters living at houses of the same name.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Rhoda, and her face lit up with pleasure.  \"It's mother!  Of course it's mother!  It's just the sort of thing mother would do.  I  told her that your brother had been ill, and that you were anxious about  him, and so she set to work to see how she could help.  That's just like  mother, she's the kindest dear!  I believe she sits down in her armchair  after breakfast every single morning, and plans out how many kind things  she can do during the day.\"    \"Bless her heart!\" cried Miss Everett devoutly.  \"Well, Rhoda, she  succeeded this time.  My mother has written me all about it.  It was a  dull, wet day, and Lionel seemed depressed, and there was nothing nice  in the house, and nothing nice to be bought in the little village shops,  and she was just wondering, wondering how in the world she could cheer  him, and manufacture a tempting lunch out of hopeless materials, when  tap-tap-tap came the carrier's man at the door.  Then in came the  hamper, and Lionel insisted upon opening it himself, and was so  interested and excited!  There were all sorts of good things in it--  game, and grapes, and lovely, lovely hot-house flowers filling up the  chinks.  They were all so happy!  It was such a piece of cheer arriving  in that unexpected fashion, and mother says the house is fragrant with  the scent of the flowers.  Lionel arranged them himself.  It kept him  quite happy and occupied.  How can I thank you, dear?\"    \"Don't thank me.  It was not my doing.  It's mother.\"    \"But how did your mother know where we lived?  How did she know who we  were?\"    \"Well!\"  Rhoda smiled and flushed.  \"Naturally I tell her the news.  I  suppose I must have mentioned that your father was Vicar of Stourley.  I  don't remember; but then I've so often written about you, and she would  naturally be glad to do anything she could, for she knows you have been  kind to me, and that I'm very--fond of you!\"    Miss Everett bent down quickly, and kissed her on the cheek.    \"And my people knew who Mr Chester was because I've written of you, and  they know that you have been kind to _me_, and that I'm fond of you,  too.  Oh Rhoda, you don't know how lonely it feels to be a teacher  sometimes, or how grateful we are to anyone who treats us as human  beings, and not as machines.  You don't know how you have cheered me  many a time.\"    \"But--but--I've been tiresome, and stupid, and rebellious.  I've given  you lots of trouble--\"    \"Perhaps, but you have been affectionate too, and seemed to like me a  little bit, in spite of my lectures; and if it had not been for your  kind words the hamper would never have come, so I insist upon thanking  you as well as your mother.  Many, many thanks, dear!  I shall always  re--\" She stopped short suddenly, her attention arrested by the scraping  of chairs within the parlour, and concluded in a very different tone,  \"The girls are coming!  For pity's sake don't let Tom find us  sentimentalising here!  Fly, Rhoda, fly!\" and off she ran along the  corridor, flop, flop, flop, on her flat-soled shoes, as much in fear of  the scrutiny of the head girl as the youngest Blue in the house!        CHAPTER TWELVE.    HOME AGAIN.    The week of examination passed slowly by, and the morning dawned when  the all-important lists were to be read aloud.  The girls were tired  after the strain, the teachers exhausted by the work of reading over  hundreds of papers, and it was consequently a somewhat"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#17)"],[1,"opposite side to where I stood, and  calmly crossed over whilst I went round. At last, by long and patient  waiting, he, too, allowed me to come near and present my seductive food  to his notice--the wiry proboscis was uncoiled and felt about for the  honey; once plunged into that, all volition seemed to cease, he allowed  me to coax him upon my finger, and he, too, was safely caged; but he  behaved very differently from \"fair Cynthia.\" The moment his repast was  ended he flapped with desperate force against the bars, and in a minute  he was out and on the window-pane, fluttering to escape. The cage had to  be secured with fine net, and he was replaced and soon quieted down.  Twice a day these delicate little pets would come upon my hand to  receive their sweet food, and appeared perfectly content in captivity.    [Footnote 2: The former Latin name for the \"Painted Lady\" butterfly]          [Illustration]    ANT-LIONS.    (MYRMELEON FORMICARIUS.)      Many years ago a friend sent me some of these remarkable insects from  the Riviera, and for sixteen months I fed them as regularly as possible,  but the cold of a remarkably severe winter killed them, to my great  disappointment, as I had hoped to be rewarded by a sight of the perfect  insect.    Ant-lions are not, I believe, found in any part of England, so I had to  wait till I could again procure some from the south of France, where  they are frequently met with in dry, sandy places.    Early in March this year (1890) three specimens were sent me and were at  once placed in a box of dry silver sand, where they buried themselves  and remained quietly resting for some hours.    Many of my readers may be interested to know what the ant-lion is like,  and why I thought it worth while to take great pains to rear it. These  young specimens were flat, grey, six-legged creatures about the size of  a small lady-bird, covered with hairs, and possessing two strong forceps  projecting from their heads. They are so formed that they cannot go  forward, but move always backward by a series of jerks. As they live  upon ants and are so strangely formed, they have to resort to stratagem  in order to entrap their prey, and this they do by means of pits formed  in the sand in which they live; into these pits the ants fall, and are  seized by the forceps of the ant-lion, who lies in wait at the bottom.    Many a time have I watched the formation of these pits, and will try to  describe the process. The insect begins describing a small circle on  the surface of the sand by jerking himself backwards and flinging the  sand away with his flat head and closed forceps, which form a kind of  shovel. Each circle is smaller than the last, until the pit is like an  inverted cone, and the ant-lion lies buried at the bottom, only his  forceps being visible. When an ant has fallen headlong down into the pit  it makes frantic efforts to escape, and if the ant-lion sees that it is  likely to get beyond his reach, he then with his forceps flings some  sand at it with such unerring aim the poor victim is sure to roll over  and over until it reaches the jaws of its captor, who feasts upon it and  then flings the remains of the body out of the pit.    One difficulty was how to ensure a supply of ants, but this was overcome  by filling a box with part of an ants' nest, and as these insects  settled down and seemed content with their quarters, they were ready  when wanted, and three times a day the lions had to be fed! One learns  to sacrifice one's feelings in the cause of science, but to the last it  was a real distress to me to have to put the poor little ants where they  would be devoured; but Nature is cruel, and from the real lion to his  insect namesake, preying upon one another seems the prevailing law of  her realm.    As the ant-lions grew, the pits increased in size. At first they were  about as large as a threepenny-piece, but ended by measuring more than  two inches across.    I could not tell whether the insect moulted its skin, as it was always  hidden, but in July, after four months' feeding, the ant-lions changed  into chrysalides, which looked like perfectly round balls of sand.    The box was placed in a warm greenhouse, and in seven weeks' time the  perfect insects appeared. They were like small dragon-flies, with  slender bodies, four black-spotted gauzy wings, two large black eyes and  short antennae.    I had read about their being nocturnal insects, feeding on flies, so  they had that diet provided for them in the glass globe in which they  were kept, but I could never feel sure that they ate the flies, and  fearing they would be starved I tried giving them a little sweet food, a  drop of raspberry syrup at the end of a twig; it seemed to be the right  thing, for they greedily sucked it in, but in spite of all my care they  only lived four weeks; which, however, is probably the term of their  existence.    Whilst I was writing this paper a singular incident occurred. I heard a  strange, wild note, and something brilliant dashed past me to the end of  the room, and there, on a white marble bust sat a lovely kingfisher--a  bird I had hardly ever seen, even at a distance, and here he had come to  pay me a visit in my drawing-room. Would that I could have told him how  welcome he was! but, alas! he darted about the room in wild alarm, flew  against the looking-glasses, and though I tried to guard him from a  plate-glass window, that has often proved fatal to birds, I was too  late; he came with a crash against it and fell down quite dead, his neck  being broken by the force of the blow.    I had heard that a kingfisher had been seen at my lake, and hoped that  the bird might build and become established there; it was, therefore, a  keen regret to me that this bright visitant had met with such an  untimely fate.          [Illustration: THE ROBIN.]    ROBINS I HAVE KNOWN.      If I once begin to speak about these winning, confiding little birds, I  shall hardly know when to stop. There can scarcely be a more delightful  pet than a wild robin which has learnt to love you, and will come  indoors and be your quiet companion for hours together. One can feel  happy in the thought that he has his liberty and his natural food out of  doors, and that he gives you his companionship freely because he likes  to be with you, and shows that he does, by singing his sweet songs  perched on the looking-glass or some vase of flowers.    Autumn is the best time to begin taming such a little friend. When one  of those brown-coated young birds in his first year's plumage (before  the red feathers show) takes to haunting the window-ledge, or looks up  inquiringly from the gravel path outside, then is the time to throw out  a mealworm, four or five times a day, when the bird appears. He will  soon associate you with his pleasant diet, and come nearer, and grow  daily less fearful, until, by putting mealworms on a mat just inside the  room, he will come in and take them, and at last learn to be quite  content to remain. The first few times the window should be left open to  let him retreat, for unless he feels he can come and go at will he will  probably make a dash at a closed window, not seeing the glass, and be  fatally injured, or else too frightened to return.    Like all other taming, it must be carried on with patience.    One summer, many years ago, we occupied an old-fashioned house in the  country, where, in perfect quietude, one could make acquaintance with  birds and study their habits and manners without interruption. From the  veranda of a large, low-ceilinged sitting-room one looked out upon a  garden of the olden type, full of moss-grown apple-trees, golden  daffodils, lupines and sweet herbs, that pleasant mixture of the kitchen  and flower garden which always seems so enjoyable. It was an ideal home  for birds, no cat was ever visible, and from the numbers of the  feathered folk one could believe that countless generations had been  reared in these apple-trees and lived out their little lives in perfect  happiness. I soon found a friend amongst the robins; one in particular  began to pay me frequent visits as I sat at work indoors. At first he  ventured in rather timidly, took a furtive glance and then flew away,  but finding that crumbs were scattered for him, and while he picked them  up a kindly voice encouraged his advances, he soon became at ease, made  his way into the room and seemed to examine by turns, with birdish  curiosity, all the pieces of furniture and the various ornaments on the  mantelpiece and tables. Much to my pleasure he began to sing to me, and  very pretty he looked, sitting amongst the flowers in a tall vase,  warbling his charming little ditty, keeping his large black eyes fixed  upon me as if to see if I seemed impressed by his vocal efforts.    Once he stopped in the middle of his song, looked keenly at a corner of  the ceiling, and after a swift flight there, he returned with a spider  in his beak; one can well believe what good helpers the insect-eating  birds must be to the gardener, by destroying countless hosts of minute  caterpillars and grubs that would otherwise prey upon the garden  produce. Bobbie continued his visits to me throughout the summer,  remaining happy and content for hours at a time, pluming himself,  singing, and at times investigating the contents of a little cupboard,  where he sometimes discovered a cake which was much to his taste, on  which he feasted without any leave asked, though truly it would have  been readily given to such a pleasant little visitor. He soon showed  such entire confidence in me that he would perch on the book I was  reading, and alight on my lap for crumbs even when many people were in  the room.    When we had to leave this country home I wished that dear Bobbie could  have been packed up to go elsewhere with our other possessions, but  since this could not be, let us hope he still inhabits the old garden "]]]
