And when death mercifully  releases this sufferer from his hellish torture the preacher murmurs,  \"Lord, thy will be done.\"    The Martian talks for a few moments with a sufferer from this disease  and ascertains that the latter is a devout and true religionist, that he  has been a good, moral church-goer, and has lived strictly according to  the tenets of his creed, that he firmly and passionately believes that  he has lived so that he will merit the reward of heaven, an everlasting  sojourn in a land where there is no pain and suffering. And yet, this  devout religionist, when he was informed that he had an incurable  cancer, traveled the length and breadth of his land, from one surgeon to  another, allowing himself to be cut to pieces, in order that he might  remain on this earth but a moment longer. To stay and suffer the  tortures of the damned when he might go to heaven and get his reward in  the land where there is no pain!    \"I wonder,\" mused the Martian, \"did the grim spectre of death finally  instill a grain of scepticism into his mind?\"    Later, in the quiet of his chambers, he reviews the day's  impressions--cruelty, hate, fear, jealousy, racial antagonism, poverty,  luxury, disease, pain, superstition, church, religion, and intolerance.    \"If we suppose that the universe is the creation of an Omnipotent and  Benevolent God, it becomes necessary to ask how pain and evil arise.  Pain and evil are either real or unreal. If they are real then God, who,  being omnipotent, was bound by no limitations and constrained by no  necessities, willfully created them. But the being who willfully creates  pain and evil cannot be benevolent. If they are unreal, then the error  which we make when we think them real is a real error. There is no doubt  that we believe we suffer. If the belief is erroneous, then it follows  that God willfully called falsehood into existence and deliberately  involved us in unnecessary error. It follows once again that God cannot  be benevolent.    \"If we regard pain and evil as due to the wickedness of man and not as  the creation of God, we are constrained to remember that man himself is  one of God's creations (God being conceived as all creative), and  received his wickedness, or his capacity for it, from whom? If we say  that man had no wickedness to begin with but willfully generated  wickedness for himself, we have to face the double difficulty of  accounting for: (a) How man, who is an emanation from God, can will with  a will of his own which is not also a piece of God's will; and (b) how a  benevolent God could, assuming pain and evil to be a purely human  creation, deliberately allow them to be introduced into a world that  knew them not, when it was open to Him to prevent such introductions.\"  (_C. E. M. Joad, \"Mind and Matter.\"_)    He had seen that crime and immorality exist now, just as they had  existed before the belief in one personal God, and just as they promise  to exist beyond our time. He had scrutinized evidence revealing the  incontestable fact that most criminals were religious, and absolutely  and proportionately, a smaller number of criminals were non-believers in  a personal deity. Judging by these alone, a belief in a benevolent,  loving, omniscient, omnipotent, and compassionate Being could not be  sustained. Furthermore, if such a God ever existed, he certainly would  have revealed his true religion to the first man, Adam. If he required  prayer to satisfy his vanity, he surely would have told Adam how, when,  why, and where to pray. Then again, once having neglected to inform his  first model about all this, since He is omnipotent, he would certainly  have instilled into the minds of men \"the\" true creed so that no doubt  could have ever entered into any one's mind. What a universe of  suffering He would have saved!    The Martian is aware that a great number of earthlings hold that every  event must have a cause, therefore the Universe must have had a cause,  which cause was God. Everything as it now exists in the universe is the  result of an infinite series of causes and effects. Everything that  happens is the result of something else that happened previously and so  on backwards to all eternity. Applying this reasoning that everything is  the effect of some cause, and that a cause is the effect of some other  causes, the theists work back from effect to cause and from cause to  effect until they reach a First Cause. By predicating a First Cause,  however, the theist removes the mystery a stage further back. This  First Cause they assume to be a cause that was not caused and this First  Cause is God. Such a belief is a logical absurdity, and is an example of  the ancient custom of creating a mystery to explain a mystery. If  everything must have a cause, then the First Cause must be caused and  therefore: Who made God? To say that this First Cause always existed is  to deny the basic assumption of this \"Theory.\" Moreover, if it is  reasonable to assume a First Cause as having always existed, why is it  unreasonable to assume that the materials of the universe always  existed? To explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure; to  explain the known by the unknown is a form of theological lunacy.    The effect noted in any particular case is not of necessity related to a  single cause, and science gives no assurance that causes and effects can  be traced backward to a simple First Cause. A man is so unfortunate as  to contract pneumonia. What is the cause? An infection of the  respiratory tract by the pneumococcus. It is not quite so simple as to  ultimate causation. The person afflicted was harboring these germs in  his nose and throat, and his resistance was weakened by wetting his  feet. The day was cold and his shoes were thin. The humidity and  temperature were such that rain fell. The temperature and humidity were  caused by air currents hundreds of miles distant from the scene, and so  ad infinitum. In this series of complications where may we discern a  first cause? When applied to the much more difficult problem of physical  phenomena, we can conceive of an endless cycle of causes, but we cannot  conceive of a First Cause. \"Cause and effect are not two separate  things, they are the same thing viewed under two separate aspects.... If  cause and effect are the expressions of a relation, and if they are not  two things, but only one, under two aspects, 'cause' being the name for  the related powers of the factors, and 'effect' the name for their  assemblage, to talk, as does the theist, of working back along the chain  of causes until we reach God, is nonsense.\" (_Chapman Cohen: \"Theism or  Atheism.\"_)    A great many theists attempt to deduce the existence of an invisible  creator and ruler of the universe from the visible features of nature  such as the design, regularity of movement and structure, and the  various aspects of beauty which one may find in studying natural  objects. This argument from design in nature has been overruled by a  study of the evolutionary processes. Paley based his argument on the  assertion of a mind behind phenomena, the workings of which could be  seen in the forms of animal life. The theists no longer use Paley's  original arguments, but a great deal of the theistic arguments are still  based on his assumptions. From the humanistic point of view, and the  theist bases his entire arguments from design in nature from the  humanistic view, an understanding of the merciless character of organic  evolution shows clearly that the forces at work in nature are full of  waste, there are numerous plans that are futile, there is an unrelenting  preying of one form of life upon the other, and it is not always the  \"higher\" form that is victor; there are myriads of living organisms  coming to life only to perish before reaching an age at which they can  play their part in the perpetuation of the species; and there is a  universe of pain and misery that serves no useful purpose. The impartial  eye of science observes ugliness as well as beauty, disorder as well as  order, in nature. If there is evidence of design in a rose, there is at  least as much evidence of design in the tubercle bacillus, and the  tetanus bacillus. Whatever in nature produced the peacock produced the  itch-mite; whatever produced man produced the spirochete of syphilis. If  this earth is evolving for the better, the past is still vivid in all  its cruelty. The old and familiar argument from design and beauty in  nature is so inconsistent with the facts at hand, that most theists have  abandoned this attitude, and the retreat from this position has been  turned into a veritable rout by the steady advance of scientific  knowledge. God could by exercising His omnipotence reveal His existence  with overpowering conviction at any moment; yet, men have been searching  for centuries for just the slightest evidence of His presence.    The Martian, moreover, holds that the entire argument is irrelevant, for  even if he grants that there is a supernatural being that fashions that  which we behold at work in the universe, how can we say that he designed  all this without first knowing what his intention was? Only by knowing  the intention in the mind of a supernatural being before the act, can we  infer that something was designed. When the theist finds intention and  design in nature he is but reading his own feeling and desires into  nature. Considering the universe as a whole, the Martian fails to find  anything that suggests a conscious and purposive god, and certainly  nothing to suggest a being that considers the welfare of man. The  individual is not much interested in God as manifested in nature, what  he is vainly seeking is _God as Providence_; he is seeking an  intelligence that his clergy tell him is devoted to his welfare, an  intelligence that will guide his stumbling efforts, that will relieve  him from war and misery, that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#17)"],[1," mind in chaos, Soames sank down upon the bed, locked his hands  together and hugged them, convulsively, between his knees.    It was come! He had overstepped that almost invisible boundary-line  which divides indiscretion from crime. He knew now that the voice within  him, the voice which had warned him against Gianapolis and against  becoming involved in what dimly he had perceived to be an elaborate  scheme, had been, not the voice of cowardice (as he had supposed) but  that of prudence.    And it was too late. The dead woman, he told himself--he had been unable  to see her very clearly--undoubtedly was Mrs. Leroux. What in God's name  had happened! Probably her husband had killed her... which meant? It  meant that proofs--PROOFS--were come into his possession; and who should  be involved, entangled in the meshes of this fallen conspiracy, but  himself, Luke Soames!    As must be abundantly evident, Soames was not a criminal of the daring  type; he did not believe in reaching out for anything until he was  well assured that he could, if necessary, draw back his hand. This last  venture, this regrettable venture--this ruinous venture--had been  a mistake. He had entered into it under the glamour of Gianapolis'  personality. Of what use, now, to him was his swelling bank balance?    But in justice to the mental capacity of Soames, it must be admitted  that he had not entirely overlooked such a possibility as this; he had  simply refrained, for the good of his health, from contemplating it.    Long before, he had observed, with interest, that, should an emergency  arise (such as a fire), a means of egress had been placed by the kindly  architect adjacent to his bedroom window. Thus, his departure on the  night of the murder was not the fruit of a sudden scheme, but of one  well matured.    Closing and locking his bedroom door, Soames threw out upon the bed the  entire contents of his trunk; selected those things which he considered  indispensable, and those which might constitute clues. He hastily packed  his grip, and, with a last glance about the room and some seconds of  breathless listening at the door, he attached to the handle a long piece  of cord, which at some time had been tied about his trunk, and, gently  opening the window, lowered the grip into the courtyard beneath. The  light he had already extinguished, and with the conviction dwelling in  his bosom that in some way he was become accessory to a murder--that he  was a man shortly to be pursued by the police of the civilized world--he  descended the skeleton lift-shaft, picked up his grip, and passed out  under the archway into the lane at the back of Palace Mansions and St.  Andrew's Mansions.    He did not proceed in the direction which would have brought him out  into the Square, but elected to emerge through the other end. At exactly  the moment that Inspector Dunbar rushed into his vacated room, Mr.  Soames, grip in hand, was mounting to the top of a southward bound 'bus  at the corner of Parliament Street!    He was conscious of a need for reflection. He longed to sit in some  secluded spot in order to think. At present, his brain was a mere  whirligig, and all things about him seemingly danced to the same tune.  Stationary objects were become unstable in the eyes of Soames, and the  solid earth, burst free of its moorings, no longer afforded him a safe  foothold. There was a humming in his ears; and a mist floated before his  eyes. By the time that the motor-'bus was come to the south side of the  bridge, Soames had succeeded in slowing down his mental roundabout in  some degree; and now he began grasping at the flying ideas which  the diminishing violence of his brain storm enabled him, vaguely, to  perceive.    The first fruits of his reflections were bitter. He viewed the events  of the night in truer focus; he saw that by his flight he had sealed his  fate--had voluntarily outlawed himself. It became frightfully evident  to him that he dared not seek to draw from his bank, that he dared not  touch even his modest Post Office account. With the exception of some  twenty-five shillings in his pocket, he was penniless!    How could he hope to fly the country, or even to hide himself, without  money?    He glanced suspiciously about the 'bus; for he perceived that an old  instinct had prompted him to mount one which passed the Oval--a former  point of debarkation when he lived in rooms near Kennington Park.  Someone might recognize him!    Furtively, he scanned his fellow passengers, but perceived no  acquaintance.    What should he do--where should he go? It was a desperate situation.    The inspector who had cared to study that furtive, isolated figure,  could not have failed to mark it for that of a hunted man.    At Kennington Gate the 'bus made a halt. Soames glanced at the clock on  the corner. It was close upon one A. M. Where in heaven's name should he  go? What a fool he had been to come to this district where he was known!    Stay! There was one man in London, surely, who must be almost as  keenly interested in the fate of Luke Soames as Luke Soames himself ...  Gianapolis!    Soames sprang up and hurried off the 'bus. No public telephone box would  be available at that hour, but dire need spurred his slow mind and also  lent him assurance. He entered the office of the taxicab depot on the  next corner, and, from the man whom he found in charge, solicited and  obtained the favor of using the telephone. Lifting the receiver, he  asked for East 18642.    The seconds that elapsed, now, were as hours of deathly suspense to  the man at the telephone. If the number should be engaged!... If the  exchange could get no reply!...    \"Hullo!\" said a nasal voice--\"who is it?\"    \"It is Soames--and I want to speak to Mr. King!\"    He lowered his tone as much as possible, almost whispering his own name.  He knew the voice which had answered him; it was the same that he always  heard when ringing up East 18642. But would Gianapolis come to the  telephone? Suddenly--    \"Is that Soames?\" spoke the sing-song voice of the Greek.    \"Yes, yes!\"    \"Where are you?\"    \"At Kennington.\"    \"Are they following you?\"    \"No--I don't think so, at least; what am I to do? Where am I to go?\"    \"Get to Globe Road--near Stratford Bridge, East, without delay. But  whatever you do, see that you are not followed! Globe Road is the  turning immediately beyond the Railway Station. It is not too late,  perhaps, to get a 'bus or tram, for some part of the way, at any rate.  But even if the last is gone, don't take a cab; walk. When you get to  Globe Road, pass down on the left-hand side, and, if necessary, right to  the end. Make sure you are not followed, then walk back again. You will  receive a signal from an open door. Come right in. Good-by.\"    Soames replaced the receiver on the hook, uttering a long-drawn sigh of  relief. The arbiter of his fortunes had not failed him!    \"Thank you very much!\" he said to the man in charge of the office, who  had been bending over his books and apparently taking not the slightest  interest in the telephone conversation. Soames placed twopence, the  price of the call, on the desk. \"Good night.\"    \"Good night.\"    He hastened out of the gate and across the road. An electric tramcar  which would bear him as far as the Elephant-and-Castle was on the point  of starting from the corner. Grip in hand, Soames boarded the car and  mounted to the top deck. He was in some doubt respecting his mode of  travel from the next point onward, but the night was fine, even if he  had to walk, and his reviving spirits would cheer him with visions of a  golden future!    His money!--That indeed was a bitter draught: the loss of his hardly  earned savings! But he was now established--linked by a common  secret--in partnership with Gianapolis; he was one of that mysterious,  obviously wealthy group which arranged drafts on Paris--which could  afford to pay him some hundreds of pounds per annum for such a trifling  service as juggling the mail!    Mr. King!--If Gianapolis were only the servant, what a magnificent man  of business must be hidden beneath the cognomen, Mr. King! And he  was about to meet that lord of mystery. Fear and curiosity were oddly  blended in the anticipation.    By great good fortune, Soames arrived at the Elephant-and-Castle in time  to catch an eastward bound motor-'bus, a 'bus which would actually carry  him to the end of Globe Road. He took his seat on top, and with greater  composure than he had known since his dramatic meeting with Gianapolis  in Victoria Street, lighted one of Mr. Leroux's cabanas (with which he  invariably kept his case filled) and settled down to think about the  future.    His reflections served apparently to shorten the journey; and Soames  found himself proceeding along Globe Road--a dark and uninviting  highway--almost before he realized that London Bridge had been  traversed. It was now long past one o'clock; and that part of the  east-end showed dreary and deserted. Public houses had long since  ejected their late guests, and even those argumentative groups,  which, after closing-time, linger on the pavements, within the odor  Bacchanalian, were dispersed. The jauntiness was gone, now, from Soames'  manner, and aware of a marked internal depression, he passed furtively  along the pavement with its long shadowy reaches between the islands  of light formed by the street lamps. From patch to patch he passed, and  each successive lamp that looked down upon him found him more furtive,  more bent in his carriage.    Not a shop nor a house exhibited any light. Sleeping Globe Road, East,  served to extinguish the last poor spark of courage within Soames'  bosom. He came to the extreme end of the road without having perceived  a beckoning hand, without having detected a sound to reveal that his  advent was observed. In the shadow of a wall he stopped, resting his  grip upon the pavement and looking"]]]
