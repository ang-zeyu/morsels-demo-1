Such  men wear European clothes, eat European food, and live in houses partly  or wholly furnished in European style. Behind this facade exists every  possible variation of inner life, from earnest enthusiasm for Western  ideals to inveterate reaction.    These varied attitudes toward Westernism are not parked off by groups or  localities, they co-exist among the individuals of every class and every  land in the East. The entire Orient is, in fact, undergoing a prodigious  transformation, far more sudden and intense than anything the West has  ever known. Our civilization is mainly self-evolved; a natural growth  developing by normal, logical, and relatively gradual stages. The East,  on the contrary, is undergoing a concentrated process of adaptation  which, with us, was spread over centuries, and the result is not so much  evolution as revolution--political, economic, social, idealistic,  religious, and much more besides. The upshot is confusion, uncertainty,  grotesque anachronism, and glaring contradiction. Single generations  are sundered by unbridgeable mental and spiritual gulfs. Fathers do not  understand sons; sons despise their fathers. Everywhere the old and the  new struggle fiercely, often within the brain or spirit of the same  individual. The infinite complexity of this struggle as it appears in  India is well summarized by Sir Valentine Chirol when he speaks of the  many \"currents and cross-currents of the confused movement which is  stirring the stagnant waters of Indian life--the steady impact of alien  ideas on an ancient and obsolescent civilization; the more or less  imperfect assimilation of those ideas by the few; the dread and  resentment of them by those whose traditional ascendancy they threaten;  the disintegration of old beliefs, and then again their aggressive  revival; the careless diffusion of an artificial system of education,  based none too firmly on mere intellectualism, and bereft of all moral  or religious sanction; the application of Western theories of  administration and of jurisprudence to a social formation stratified on  lines of singular rigidity; the play of modern economic forces upon  primitive conditions of industry and trade; the constant and unconscious  but inevitable friction between subject races and their alien rulers;  the reverberation of distant wars and distant racial conflicts; the  exaltation of an Oriental people in the Far East.\"[76] These lines,  though written about India, apply with fair exactitude to every other  portion of the Near and Middle East to-day. As a French writer remarks  with special reference to the Levant: \"The truth is that the Orient is  in transformation, and the Mohammedan mentality as well--though not  perhaps exactly as we might wish. It is undergoing a period of crisis,  wherein the past struggles everywhere against the present; where ancient  customs, impaired by modern innovations, present a hybrid and  disconcerting spectacle.\"[77]    To this is largely due the unlovely traits displayed by most of the  so-called \"Westernized\" Orientals; the \"stucco civilization\"[78] of the  Indian Babu, and the boulevardier \"culture\" of the Turkish  \"Effendi\"--syphilized rather than civilized. Any profound transformation  must engender many worthless by-products, and the contemporary  Westernization of the Orient has its dark as well as its bright side.  The very process of reform, however necessary and inevitable, lends  fresh virulence to old ills and imports new evils previously unknown. As  Lord Cromer says: \"It is doubtful whether the price which is being paid  for introducing European civilization into these backward Eastern  societies is always recognized as fully as it should be. The material  benefits derived from European civilization are unquestionably great,  but as regards the ultimate effect on public and private morality the  future is altogether uncertain.\"[79]    The good and the evil of Westernization are alike mostly clearly evident  among the ranks of the educated elites. Some of these men show the  happiest effects of the Western spirit, but an even larger number fall  into the gulf between old and new, and there miserably perish. Lord  Cromer characterized many of the \"Europeanized\" Egyptians as \"at the  same time de-Moslemized Moslems and invertebrate Europeans\";[80] while  another British writer thus pessimistically describes the superficial  Europeanism prevalent in India: \"Beautiful Mogul palaces furnished with  cracked furniture from Tottenham Court Road. That is what we have done  to the Indian mind. We have not only made it despise its own culture and  throw it out; we have asked it to fill up the vacant spaces with  furniture which will not stand the climate. The mental Eurasianism of  India is appalling. Such minds are nomad. They belong to no  civilization, no country, and no history. They create a craving that  cannot be satisfied, and ideals that are unreal. They falsify life.  They deprive men of the nourishment of their cultural past, and the  substitutes they supply are unsubstantial.... We sought to give the  Eastern mind a Western content and environment; we have succeeded too  well in establishing intellectual and moral anarchy in both.\"[81]    These patent evils of Westernization are a prime cause of that  implacable hatred of everything Western which animates so many  Orientals, including some well acquainted with the West. Such persons  are precious auxiliaries to the ignorant reactionaries and to the rebels  against Western political domination.    The political predominance of the West over the East is, indeed, the  outstanding factor in the whole question of Western influence upon the  Orient. We have already surveyed Europe's conquest of the Near and  Middle East during the past century, and we have seen how helpless the  backward, decrepit Moslem world was in face of the twofold tide of  political and economic subjugation. In fact, the economic phase was  perhaps the more important factor in the rapidity and completeness of  Europe's success. To be sure, some Eastern lands were subjugated at a  stroke by naked military force, as in the French expedition to Algiers,  the Russian conquest of central Asia, and the Italian descent upon  Tripoli. Much oftener, however, subjection began by the essentially  economic process known as \"pacific penetration\"--the acquirement of a  financial grip upon a hitherto independent Oriental country by Western  capital in the form of loans and concessions, until the assumption of  Western political control became little more than a formal registration  of what already existed in fact. Such is the story of the subjection of  Egypt, Morocco, and Persia, while England's Indian Empire started in a  purely trading venture--the East India Company. The tremendous potency  of \"pacific penetration\" is often not fully appreciated. Take the  significance of one item alone--railway concessions. Says that keen  student of _Weltpolitik_, Doctor Dillon: \"Railways are the iron  tentacles of latter-day expanding Powers. They are stretched out  caressingly at first. But once the iron has, so to say, entered the soul  of the weaker nation, the tentacles swell to the dimensions of brawny  arms, and the embrace tightens to a crushing grip.\"[82]    On the question of the abstract rightness or wrongness of this  subjection of the East by the West, I do not propose to enter. It has  been exhaustively discussed, pro and con, and every reader of these  pages is undoubtedly familiar with the stock arguments on both sides.  The one thing certain is that this process of subjugation was, broadly  speaking, inevitable. Given two worlds at such different levels as East  and West at the beginning of the nineteenth century--the West  overflowing with vitality and striding at the forefront of human  progress, the East sunk in lethargy and decrepitude--and it was a  foregone conclusion that the former would encroach upon the latter.    What does concern us in our present discussion is the effect of European  political control upon the general process of Westernization in Eastern  lands. And there can be no doubt that such Westernization was thereby  greatly furthered. Once in control of an Oriental country, the European  rulers were bound to favour its Westernization for a variety of reasons.  Mere self-interest impelled them to make the country peaceful and  prosperous, in order to extract profit for themselves and reconcile the  inhabitants to their rule. This meant the replacement of inefficient and  sanguinary native despotisms inhibiting progress and engendering anarchy  by stable colonial governments, maintaining order, encouraging  industry, and introducing improvements like the railway, the post,  sanitation, and much more besides. In addition to these material  innovations, practically all the Western governments endeavoured to  better the social, intellectual, and spiritual condition of the peoples  that had come under their control. The European Powers who built up  colonial empires during the nineteenth century were actuated by a spirit  far more enlightened than that of former times, when the early colonial  empires of Spain, Portugal, Holland, and the English East India Company  had been run on the brutal and short-sighted doctrine of sheer  exploitation. In the nineteenth century all Western rule in the Orient  was more or less impregnated with the ideal of \"The White Man's Burden.\"  The great empire-builders of the nineteenth century, actuated as they  were not merely by self-interest and patriotic ambition but also by a  profound sense of obligation to improve the populations which they had  brought under their country's sway, felt themselves bearers of Western"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#17)"],[1,"his board. We read of one  old Dimbledee, of Widow Bump and Widow Bumpus, degenerate successors in  name as well as in estate of the Pilgrim Bompasse, who were sold from  year to year from one farm to another and given a grudged existence,  till at last we find the town paying for their welcome coffins and  winding sheets. Two curious facts are to be noted in the poor accounts:  that the women paupers were almost invariably \"very comfortable on it  for clothes,\" as were other women of that dress-loving day; and that  liquor was frequently supplied to both male and female paupers by the  town. Sometimes ten gallons apiece, a very consoling amount, was given  in a year. I have also noted the frequent presence on the poor-list of  what are termed \"French Neuterls.\" These were Acadians--the neighbors  and compatriots of Evangeline--feeble folk, who, void of romance,  succumbed in despair to exile and home-sickness, a new language and a  new manner of living, and yielded weakly to work as servants when they  had no courage to maintain homes. New England paupers lived to a good  old age. I have been told that the unhappy fate of one of these  town-poor--an Acadian--was traced for over thirty years in the town  records of her sale. In 1767 there were twenty-one paupers in Danvers,  Mass., and their average age was eighty-four years, thus apparently  offering proof of good rum and good usage from the town. There was also  an hereditary pauperism. In Salem a certain family always had some of  its members on the list of town-poor from the year 1721 to 1848; and  perhaps they found better homes through \"living around\" than in trying  to support themselves.    Criminals were also sold into service to work out their sentences. Thus  did the practical settlers attempt to carry out one of Sir Thomas More's  Utopian notions. Upon the whole, I think I should rather have a Nipmuck  squaw cooking in my kitchen, or a Pequot warrior digging in my garden,  than to have a white burglar or ruffian in either situation.    It is well to observe in passing that no gingerly nicety of regard in  calling those who served by any other name than servant, was shown or  heeded in olden times. They believed with St. Paul, \"Art thou called  being a servant? Care not for it.\" All hired workers in the house, hired  laborers in the field, those contracting to work under a master at any  trade for a period of time, apprentices, and many whom we should now  term agents or stewards, were then called servants, and signed contracts  as servants, and did not appear at all insulted by being termed  servants.          IV    HOME INTERIORS      It is easy to gain a definite notion of the furnishing of colonial  houses from a contemporary and reliable source--the inventories of the  estates of the colonists. These are, of course, still preserved in court  records. As it was customary in early days to enumerate with much  minuteness the various articles of furniture contained in each room,  instead of classifying or aggregating them, we have the outlines of a  clear picture of the household belongings of that day.    The first room beyond the threshold of the door that one finds named in  the houses \"of the richer sort,\" is the entry. This was apparently  always bare of furniture, and indeed well it might be, for it was seldom  aught but a vestibule to the rest of the house, containing, save the  staircase, but room enough to swing the front door in opening. Dr. Lyon  gives the inventory of John Salmon of Boston in the year 1750 as the  earliest record which he has found of the use of the word hall instead  of entry, as we now employ it. In the _Boston News Letter_, thirty one  years earlier, on August 24th, 1719, I find this advertisement: \"Fine  Glass Lamps & Lanthorns well gilt and painted both Convex and Plain.  Being suitable for Halls, staircases, or other Passage ways, at the  Glass Shop in Queen Street.\" This advertisement is, however,  exceptional. The hall in Puritan houses was not a passageway, it was the  living-room, the keeping-room, the dwelling-room, the sitting-room; in  it the family sat and ate their meals--in, it they lived. Let us see  what was the furniture of a Puritan home-room in early days, and what  its value. The inventory of the possessions of Theophilus Eaton,  Governor of the New Haven colony, is often quoted. At the time of his  death, in 1657, he had in his hall,        \"A drawing Table & a round table, L1.18s.       A cubberd & 2 long formes, 14s.       A cubberd cloth & cushions, 13s.; 4 setwork cushions,         12s. L1.5.       6 greene cushions, 12s; a greate chaire with needleworke,         13s. L1.5.       2 high chaires set work, 20s; 4 high stooles set worke,         26s 8d L6.6.8.       4 low chaires set worke, 6s 8d, L1.6.8.       2 low stooles set worke, 10s.       2 Turkey Carpette, L2; 6 high joyne stooles, 6s. L2.6.       A pewter cistern & candlestick, 4s.       A pr of great brass Andirons, 12s.       A pr of small Andirons, 6s 8d.       A pr of doggs, 2s 6d.       A pr of tongues fire pan & bellowes, 7s.\"    Now, this was a very liberally furnished living-room. There were plenty  of seats for diners and loungers, if Puritans ever lounged; two long  forms and a dozen stools of various heights, with green or embroidered  cushions, upon which to sit while at the Governor's board; and seven  chairs, gay with needlework covers, to draw around his fireplace with  its shining paraphernalia of various sized andirons, tongs, and bellows.  The low, heavy-raftered room with these plentiful seats, the tables with  their Turkey covers, the picturesque cupboard with its rich cloth, and  its display of the Governor's silver plate, all aglow with the light of  a great wood fire, make a pretty picture of comfortable simplicity,  pleasant of contemplation in our bric-a-brac filled days, a fit setting  for the figures of the Governor, \"New England's glory full of warmth and  light,\" and his dearest, greatest, best of temporal enjoyments, his  \"vertuous, prudent and prayerful wife.\"    Contemporary inventories make more clear and more positive still this  picture of a planter's home-room, for similar furniture is found in all.  All the halls had cisterns for water or for wine (and I fancy they stood  on the small table usually mentioned); all had a table for serving  meals; a majority had the cupboard; a few had \"picktures\" or \"lookeing  glasses;\" very rarely a couch or \"day-bed\" was seen; some had  \"lanthorns\" as well as candlesticks; others a spinning-wheel for the  good wife, when she \"keepit close the house and birlit at the wheel.\"    Chairs were a comparatively rare form of furniture in New England in  early colonial days, nor were they frequently seen in humble English  homes of that date. Stools and forms were the common seats. Turned,  wainscot, and covered chairs are the three distinct types mentioned in  the seventeenth century. Turned chairs are shown in good examples in  what are known as the Carver and Brewster chairs, now preserved in  Pilgrim Hall in Plymouth. The president's chair at Harvard College is  another ancient turned chair.    The seats of many of these chairs were of flags and rushes. The bark of  the elm and bass trees was also used for bottoming chairs.    The wainscot chairs were all of wood, seats as well as backs, usually of  oak. They were frequently carved or panelled. One now in Pilgrim Hall is  known as the Winslow chair. Another fine specimen in carved oak is in  the Essex Institute in Salem. Carved chairs were owned only by persons  of wealth or high standing, and were frequently covered with \"redd  lether\" or \"Rusha lether.\" Sometimes the leather was stamped and  different rich fabrics were employed to cover the seats. \"Turkey  wrought\" chairs are frequently mentioned. Velvet \"Irish stitch,\" red  cloth, and needlework covers are named. Green appeared to be, however,  the favorite color.    Cane chairs appeared in the last quarter of the century. It is said that  the use of cane was introduced into furniture with the marriage of  Charles II. to Catharine of Braganza.    The bow-legged chair, often with claw and ball foot, came into use in  the beginning of the eighteenth century. \"Crowfoot\" and \"eaglesfoot\"  were named in inventories. These are copies of Dutch shapes.    Easy-chairs also appeared at that date, usually as part of the bedroom  furniture, and were covered with the stuffs of which the bed-hangings  and window-curtains were made, such as \"China,\" \"callico,\" \"camblet,\"  \"harrateen.\"    The three-cornered chair, now known as an \"As you like it\" chair,  appeared in the middle of the century under the names of triangle,  round-about, and half-round chair.    The chairs known now as Chippendale may date back to the middle of the  century; Windsor chairs, also known and manufactured in Philadelphia at  that date, were not common in New England till a score of years later,  when they were made and sold in vast numbers, being much more  comfortable than the old bannister or slat-backed chairs then in common  use.    Another piece of hall furniture deserves special mention. Dr. Lyon gives  these names of cupboards found in New England: Cupboard, small cupboard,  great cupboard, court cupboard, livery cupboard, side cupboard, hanging  cupboard, sideboard cupboard, and cupboard with drawers. To this list  might be added corner cupboard. The word court cupboard is found from  the years 1647 to 1704. It was a high piece of furniture with an  enclosed closet or drawers, originally intended to display plate, and  was the highest-priced cupboard found. Upon it were set, in New England,  both glass and plate. The livery cupboard, similar in its uses, seldom  had an enclosed portion. \"Turn pillar cuberds,\" painted and carved  cupboards, were found. The item of cupboard in any inventory was usually  accompanied by that of a cupboard cloth. This latter seemed to be the  most elegant and"]]]
