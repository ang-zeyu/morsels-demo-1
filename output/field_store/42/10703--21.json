An amusing incident occurred during this little voyage on the schooner,  which was managed by the French traders who had threatened my life two  days before. The wind was light, and the sailors amused themselves with  music--one of them playing on a fife. He was attempting to play a tune  which he had not properly learned. I was walking the deck, and told him  to give me the fife, when I played the tune. The Frenchmen gathered  around my feet, and looked with astonishment and delight. From that hour  they were my warm friends, and offered to paddle me in their canoes  among the islands and along the shore wherever I wished to go.    By the advice of some of my brethren, I called on the  Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Peregrine Maitland, after I arrived in Toronto,  for the purpose of giving him a general account of the progress of the  Christian religion amongst the Indian tribes I said to him:--         \"The object I have in view is the amelioration of the condition of       the Indians in this Province. The importance of this, both to the       happiness of the Indian tribes, and the honour of the government       under which they live, has been deeply felt by the parent state, so       forcibly that a church was built and the Protestant religion       introduced amongst the Six-Nations at the Grand River, about the       beginning of the century. This effort of Christian benevolence has       been so far successful as to induce some hundreds of them to       receive the ordinances of the Christian religion. But the Chippewa       tribes have hitherto been overlooked, till about four years ago,       when the Methodists introduced the Christian religion amongst them.         In a short time about one hundred embraced the religion of Christ,       exhibiting every mark of a sound conversion. Their number soon       increased, and a whole tribe of Mississaugas renounced their former       superstitions and vices, and became sober, quiet Christians. They       then felt anxious to become domesticated; their desire being       favourably regarded, a village was established at the Credit, and       houses built for them.         They have this season planted about forty acres of corn and       potatoes, which promise an abundant harvest. About forty children       attend the common school, nearly twenty can write intelligibly, and       read the Holy Scriptures and the English Reader.         At Belleville a change especially interesting has been effected.       The work was commenced there about two years ago, and now in their       whole tribe, numbering about two hundred, there is not one       drunkard! They are also becoming domesticated and are building a       village on one of their islands in the Bay of Quinte, which they       had squandered away in their drunken revels, but which is now       repurchased for them by some benevolent individuals. A Day and       Sunday School are established in which upwards of fifty children       are taught.         From the Belleville Indians the Gospel spread to the tribes which       inhabit the country adjacent to Rice Lake. Here also may be seen a       wonderful display of the \"power of God unto Salvation to every one       that believeth.\" In less than a year, the whole of this body, whose       census is 300, renounced their idolatrous ceremonies and       destructive habits, for the principles, laws and blessings of that       kingdom which is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.       They are all, save a few, converted and changed in their hearts and       lives, and earnestly desire a settled life.         The uniform language of all, so soon as they embrace the Christian       religion is, \"Let us have houses, that we may live together in one       place, learn to till the ground, hear the word of the Great Spirit,       and have our children taught to read the good book.\" Another field       of Christian labour is already ripe amongst the Lake Simcoe       Indians, who number about 600 souls. About two months ago an       opportunity opened for introducing the Christian religion to them,       and such was their readiness to hear and believe the words of       salvation, that more than 100 have already professed the Christian       faith, and are entirely reformed. A school is established in which       forty are taught by a young man named William Law, lately from       England.         This extensive reformation, has been effected and continued, by       means, which, to all human appearance, are altogether inadequate to       the accomplishment of such a work. A school at the Grand River       containing thirty scholars, one at the Credit forty, another at       Belleville upwards of thirty, and one lately established at Lake       Simcoe containing forty, and the missionaries who have been       employed amongst the Indians, together with the boarding of a       number of Indian boys, have only amounted to a little more than       L150 per annum. It is of the last importance to perpetuate and       extend the impressions which have already been made on the minds of       these Indians. The schools and religious instruction must be       continued; and the Gospel must be sent to tribes still in a heathen       state. But in doing this our energies are weakened, and the       progress of Christian labour much impeded by serious difficulties       which it is in the power of the government to remove. These       obstacles are principally confined to the Lake Simcoe Indians, the       most serious of which is occasioned by the traders, who are Roman       Catholic Frenchmen, employed to accompany the Indians in their       hunting for the purpose of procuring their furs, and who are       violently opposed to the reformation of the Indians. These traders       are about eighty in number, and have long been accustomed to       defraud and abuse the Indians in the most inhuman manner; they have       even laid violent hands on some of the converted Indians, and tried       to pour whiskey down their throats; but, thank God, have failed,       the Indians successfully resisted them. To shake the faith of some,       and deter others from reforming, they have threatened to strip them       naked in the winter, when they were at a distance of 100 miles from       the white settlement, and there leave them to freeze to death.         Col. Givens, when he was up issuing their presents about a month       ago, threatened the traders severely if they disturbed the Indians       in their devotions, or did any violence to their teachers. He also       suggested the idea of your Excellency issuing a proclamation to       prevent any further abuses. Sir Peregrine replied:         \"When the Legislature meets, I shall see if something can be done       to relieve them more effectively, but I do not think that I can do       anything by the way of proclamation. If, upon deliberation, I find       that I can do something for them, I shall certainly do it.\" I       observed: The civil authority would be an ample security, while the       Indians are among the white inhabitants; but these abuses are       practised when they are one or two hundred miles from the white       settlements. The traders follow them to their hunting grounds, get       them intoxicated, and then get their furs for one fourth of their       value, nay, sometimes take them by force. These Frenchmen are       able-bodied men, and have abused the Indians so much they are       afraid of them; and, therefore, have not courage, if they had       strength to defend themselves. Under these circumstances your       Excellency will perceive the Indians have no means of obtaining       justice, and from their remote situation the power of civil       authority is merely nominal in regard to them. His Excellency       observed, \"I am very much obliged to you for this information; I       shall do all in my power for them.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [8] When about fourteen years of age, an abridged \"Life of Benjamin  Franklin\" fell into my hands, and I read it with great eagerness. I was  especially attracted by the account of his mechanical education and of  its uses to him in after years, during and after the American  Revolution, when he became Statesman, Ambassador, and Philosopher. My  father was then building a new house, and I prevailed on him to let me  work with the carpenter for six months. I did so, agreeing to pay the  old carpenter a York shilling a day for teaching me. During that time, I  learned to plane boards, shingle, and clapboard the house, make window  frames and log floors. The little knowledge and skill I then acquired,  was of great service when I was labouring among the Indians, as well as  my early training as a farmer. I became head carpenter, head farmer, as  well as missionary, among these interesting people, during the first  year of their civilized life.

The following extracts from my diary contain a detailed account of my  mental and spiritual exercises and labours at this time, as well as many  interesting particulars respecting the Indians, not mentioned in the  foregoing chapter:--         _Credit, September 16th, 1826._--I have now arrived at my charge       among the Indians. I feel an inexpressible joy in taking up my       abode amongst them. I must now acquire a new language, to teach a       new people.         _Sept. 17th._--This day I commenced my labours amongst my Indian       brethren. My heart feels one with them, as they seemed to be       tenderly alive to their eternal interests. May I possess every       necessary gift to suffer labour, and teach the truth as it is in       Jesus.         _Sept. 23rd._--Greatly distressed to-night on account of a sad       circumstance.

Muck, upon whom these movements against himself produced no effect,  thought not of revenge; for that he had too good a heart: no, he  reflected upon the means of making himself necessary to his enemies,  and beloved by them. Thereupon the staff, which in his good fortune he  had forgotten, occurred to him; if he could find treasures, he thought  the lords would be more favorably disposed towards him. He had before  this often heard that the father of the present king had buried much  of his gold, when the enemy had invaded the land; they said, moreover,  that he had died without imparting the secret to his son. From this  time Muck always carried his cane, in the hope that he would some  time pass over the place where the money of the old king was buried.    One evening, chance led him into a remote portion of the  castle-garden, which he seldom visited, when suddenly he felt the  staff move in his hand, and three times it beat upon the ground. He  knew in an instant what this indicated; accordingly he drew forth his  dagger, made marks on the surrounding trees, and then slipped back  into the castle. Then he procured a spade, and awaited night for his  undertaking.    Treasure-digging, however, gave Muck more trouble than he had  anticipated. His arms were very feeble, his spade large and heavy; he  might perhaps have been laboring a couple of hours, without getting  any farther down than as many feet. At length he hit upon something  hard, which sounded like iron: he then set to work still more  diligently, and soon brought up a large cover; he then descended into  the hole, in order to examine what the cover concealed, and found a  large pot completely full of gold pieces. His feeble wisdom, however,  did not teach him to lift up the pot; but he put in his pantaloons  and girdle as much as he could carry, filled his cloak, and then  carefully covering up the rest, placed the load upon his back. But,  indeed, if he had not had the slippers on his feet, he could not have  stirred, so heavily did the gold weigh him down. Then, unobserved, he  reached his room, and secured the money under the cushions of his  sofa.    When the little man saw so much gold in his possession, he thought the  tables would now be turned, and that from among his enemies at court,  he could gain many well-wishers and warm friends. But even in this,  one could see that the good Muck had enjoyed no very careful  education; otherwise he would not have imagined that he could buy true  friends with gold. Ah! that he had then put on his slippers, and with  his mantle full of gold, scampered away!    The gold which from this time Little Muck distributed with lavish  hand, awakened the envy of the other court-attendants. The  kitchen-master, Ahuli, said, \"He is a counterfeiter.\" The  slave-overseer, Achmet, said, \"He has cajoled the king.\" But Archaz,  the treasurer, his most wicked enemy, who himself, even, now and then  put his hand into his lord's coffers, exclaimed, \"He is a thief.\" In  order to be sure of the thing, they consulted together, and the head  cup-bearer, Korchuz, placed himself one day, with a very sorrowful and  depressed air, before the eyes of the king. He made his wo so  apparent, that the king asked him what was the matter.    \"Ah!\" answered he, \"I am sorry that I have lost the favor of my lord!\"    \"Why talkest thou idly, friend Korchuz?\" rejoined the monarch. \"Since  when have I veiled from thee the sun of my favor?\"    The cup-bearer answered, that he loaded his private Oberleiblaeufer  with money, but gave his poor faithful servants nothing. The king was  much astonished at this accusation, had the story of Muck's  gold-distribution told him, and the conspirators soon aroused in him  the suspicion that the dwarf had, in some way or other, stolen the  money from the treasure-chamber. Very pleasant was this turn of the  matter to the treasurer, who would not otherwise have willingly  submitted his accounts to examination. The king thereupon commanded  that they should secretly watch all the movements of the dwarf, in  order, if possible, to surprise him in the act. When, now, on the  night which followed the fatal day, seeing his funds almost exhausted  by his generosity, Muck crept forth, with his spade, into the  castle-garden, to bring new supplies from his secret treasury, the  watch followed him in the distance, led by Ahuli and Archaz; and, at  the moment when he was removing the gold from the pot to his cloak,  they fell upon him, bound him, and immediately led him before the  king. The latter, whom, independently of any thing else, this  interruption of his sleep would have enraged, received his poor dwarf  very ungraciously, and ordered an immediate trial. Meanwhile they had  dug the full pot out of the ground, and with the spade and cloak full  of gold had placed it before the king. The treasurer said that he had  surprised Muck with his guard, just as he had buried this vessel of  gold in the earth.    The king thereupon inquired of the accused, whether it was true, and  whence the gold had come.    Little Muck, conscious of innocence, answered that he had discovered  this pot in the garden; that he had not buried it, but had brought it  to light.    All present laughed aloud at this defence; the king, however, provoked  in the highest degree by the supposed impudence of the dwarf,  exclaimed, \"How, wretch! wilt thou so stupidly and shamelessly lie to  thy king, after having stolen from him? Treasurer Archaz, I command  thee to say whether thou knowest this sum of gold to be the same that  is missing from my treasury.\"    The treasurer thereupon answered that he was sure of the thing; that  so much and even more had been missing from the royal treasures; and  he could take his oath that this was the stolen money. Then the king  commanded them to place Little Muck in galling chains, and convey him  to prison: to Archaz, however, he gave the gold, that he might restore  it to the treasury. Delighted at the fortunate issue of the matter,  the officer took it, and counted out, at home, the glittering gold  pieces; but the bad man never disclosed that down in the pot lay a  letter, to the following purport:--        \"The enemy has overrun my land; therefore I here conceal      a portion of my treasure. Whoever may find it, the curse      of his king fall upon him, if he do not immediately      deliver it to my son!            KING SADI.\"    In his dungeon, poor Muck gave way to sorrowful reflections; he knew  that for taking royal property death was the penalty; and yet--he  could not betray the secret of his staff unto the king, because, in  that case, he justly feared being deprived of both that, and his  slippers. His slippers, alas! could render him no help, for there by  close fetters he was fastened to the wall, and, torment himself as he  might, he could not turn around upon his heel. When, however, on the  next day, sentence of death was pronounced, he thought it would be  better to live without the magic staff, than to die with it; and,  having asked a private audience with the king, disclosed to him the  secret. At first the king gave no credit to his assertions, but Little  Muck promised him a proof, if he would respite him from death. The  king gave him his word upon it, and having had some gold buried in the  earth, unseen by Muck, commanded him to find it with his cane. In a  few moments he succeeded in doing so, for the staff beat three times  distinctly upon the ground. Then the king saw that his treasurer had  betrayed him, and sent him, as is customary in the East, a silken  cord, wherewith he should strangle himself. To Little Muck, however,  he said:--    \"I have indeed promised thee thy life, but it seems to me that this is  not the only secret thou art possessed of, connected with this staff.  Therefore thou shalt remain in everlasting captivity, if thou do not  confess what relation exists between it and thy rapid running.\"    Little Muck, whom one night in his dungeon had deprived of all desire  for further confinement, acknowledged that his whole art lay in the  slippers; nevertheless, he informed not the king of the wonderful  effect of turning three times upon the heel. The king put on the  slippers, himself, in order to make the experiment, and ran, like mad,  through the garden; often did he wish to hold up, but he knew not how  to bring the slippers to a halt, and Muck, who could not deny himself  this revenge, let him run on, until he fell down exhausted.    When the king returned to consciousness, he was terribly angry at  Little Muck, who had suffered him to run until so entirely out of  breath. \"I have promised thee thy freedom and life,\" said he, \"but  within twelve hours must thou leave my land; otherwise will I have  thee hung.\" The slippers and cane, however, he commanded them to bear  to his treasure-chamber.    Thus, poor as ever, wandered the little fellow forth through the land,  cursing the folly which had led him astray, and prevented his playing  an important part at court. The land from which he was banished, was  fortunately not extensive, and accordingly eight hours brought him to  the frontier; but travelling, now that he was used to his dear  slippers, came very hard to him. Having arrived at the border, he  chose the usual road for reaching the most lonely part of the forest,  for he hated all men, and resolved to live there by himself. In a  thick portion of the wood, he lighted on a place, which seemed to him  quite suitable for the resolution he had taken. A clear brook,  surrounded by large shady fig-trees, and a soft turf, invited him: he  threw himself down, determined to taste food no more, but calmly to  await his end. Amid his sorrowful reflections on death, he fell  asleep; when he awoke, he was tormented by hunger, and began to think  that starving to"]]]
