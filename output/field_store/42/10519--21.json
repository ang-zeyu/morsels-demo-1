This wall appears to have extended originally all along the ledge around  three sides of the village. The steepness of the cliff on the remaining  side rendered a wall superfluous. On the plain below this promontory,  and immediately under the overhanging cliff, are two corrals, and also  the remains of a structure that resembles a kiva, but which appears to  be of recent construction.    In the village proper (Pl. XIV) are two distinctly traceable kivas. One  of these, situated in the court, is detached and appears to have been  partly underground. The other, located in the southeast end of the  village, has also, like the first, apparently been sunk slightly below  the surface. There is a jog in the standing wall of this kiva which  corresponds to that usually found in the typical Tusayan kivas (see  Figs. 22 and 25). On the promontory and east of the village is a single  room of more than average length, with a well formed door in the center  of one side. This room has every appearance of being contemporary with  the rest of the village, but its occurrence in this entirely isolated  position is very unusual. Still farther east there is a mass of debris  that may have belonged to a cluster of six or eight rooms, or it may  possibly be the remains of temporary stone shelters for outlooks over  crops, built at a later date than the pueblo. As may be seen from the  illustration (Pl. XV), the walls are roughly built of large slabs of  sandstone of various sizes. The work is rather better than that of  modern Tusayan, but much inferior to that seen in the skillfully laid  masonry of the ruins farther north. In many of these walls an occasional  sandstone slab of great length is introduced. This peculiarity is  probably due to the character of the local material, which is more  varied than usual. All of the stone here used is taken from ledges in  the immediate vicinity. It is usually light in color and of loose  texture, crumbling readily, and subject to rapid decay, particularly  when used in walls that are roughly constructed.    Much of the pottery scattered about this ruin has a very modern  appearance, some of it having the characteristic surface finish and  color of the Rio Grande ware. A small amount of ancient pottery also  occurs here, some of the fragments of black and white ware displaying  intricate fret patterns. The quantity of these potsherds is quite small,  and they occur mainly in the refuse heaps on the mesa edge.    This ruin combines a clearly defined defensive plan with utilization of  one of the most inaccessible sites in the vicinity, producing altogether  a combination that would seem to have been impregnable by any of the  ordinary methods of Indian warfare.      [Illustration: Plate XXV. Foot trail to Walpi.]      PLANS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INHABITED VILLAGES.    HANO.    The village of Hano, or Tewa, is intrusive and does not properly belong  to the Tusayan stock, as appears from their own traditions. It is  somewhat loosely planned (Pl. XVI) and extends nearly across the mesa  tongue, which is here quite narrow, and in general there is no  appreciable difference between the arrangement here followed and that of  the other villages. One portion of the village, however, designated as  House No. 5 on the plan, differs somewhat from the typical arrangement  in long irregular rows, and approaches the pyramidal form found among  the more eastern pueblos, notably at Taos and in portions of Zuñi. As  has been seen, tradition tells us that this site was taken up by the  Tewa at a late date and subsequent to the Spanish conquest; but some  houses, formerly belonging to the Asa people, formed a nucleus about  which the Tewa village of Hano was constructed. The pyramidal house  occupied by the old governor, is said to have been built over such  remains of earlier houses.    The largest building in the village appears to have been added to from  time to time as necessity for additional space arose, resulting in much  the same arrangement as that characterizing most of the Tusayan houses,  viz, a long, irregular row, not more than three stories high at any  point. The small range marked No. 4 on the plan contains a section three  stories high, as does the long row and also the pyramidal cluster above  referred to. (Pl. XVII.)    The kivas are two in number, one situated within the village and the  other occupying a position in the margin of the mesa. These ceremonial  chambers, so far as observed, appear to be much like those in the other  villages, both in external and internal arrangement.    Within the last few years the horse trail that afforded access to Hano  and Sichumovi has been converted into a wagon road, and during the  progress of this work, under the supervision of an American,  considerable blasting was done. Among other changes the marginal kiva,  which was nearly in line with the proposed improvements, was removed.  This was done despite the protest of the older men, and their  predictions of dire calamity sure to follow such sacrilege. A new site  was selected close by and the newly acquired knowledge of the use of  powder was utilized in blasting out the excavation for this subterranean  chamber. It is altogether probable that the sites of all former kivas  were largely determined by accident, these rooms being built at points  where natural fissures or open spaces in the broken mesa edge furnished  a suitable depression or cavity. The builders were not capable of  working the stone to any great extent, and their operations were  probably limited to trimming out such natural excavations and in part  lining them with masonry.    There is a very noticeable scarcity of roof-holes, aside from those of  the first terrace. As a rule the first terrace has no external openings  on the ground and is entered from its roof through large trap-doors, as  shown on the plans. The lower rooms within this first terrace are not  inhabited, but are used as storerooms.    At several points ruined walls are seen, remains of abandoned rooms that  have fallen into decay. Occasionally a rough, buttress-like projection  from a wall is the only vestige of a room or a cluster of rooms, all  traces on the ground having been obliterated.    The mesa summit, that forms the site of this village, is nearly level,  with very little earth on its surface. A thin accumulation of soil and  rubbish lightly covers the inner court, but outside, along the face of  the long row, the bare rock is exposed continuously. Where the rooms  have been abandoned and the walls have fallen, the stones have all been  utilized in later constructions, leaving no vestige of the former wall  on the rocky site, as the stones of the masonry have always been set  upon the surface of the rock, with no excavation or preparation of  footings of any kind.    SICHUMOVI.    According to traditional accounts this village was founded at a more  recent date than Walpi. It has, however, undergone many changes since  its first establishment.    The principal building is a long irregular row, similar to that of Hano  (Pl. XVIII). A portion of an L-shaped cluster west of this row, and a  small row near it parallel to the main building, form a rude  approximation to the inclosed court arrangement. The terracing here,  however, is not always on the court side, whereas in ancient examples  such arrangement was an essential defensive feature, as the court  furnished the only approach to upper terraces. In all of these villages  there is a noticeable tendency to face the rows eastward instead of  toward the court. The motive of such uniformity of direction in the  houses must have been strong, to counteract the tendency to adhere to  the ancient arrangement. The two kivas of the village are built side by  side, in contact, probably on account of the presence at this point of a  favorable fissure or depression in the mesa surface.    On the south side of the village are the remains of two small clusters  of rooms that apparently have been abandoned a long time. A portion of a  room still bounded by standing walls has been utilized as a corral for  burros (PL. XIX).      [Illustration: Plate XXVI. Mashongnavi, plan.]    At this village are three small detached houses, each composed of but a  single room, a feature not at all in keeping with the spirit of pueblo  construction. In this instance it is probably due to the selection of  the village as the residence of whites connected with the agency or  school. Of these single-room houses, one, near the south end of the long  row, was being built by an American, who was living in another such  house near the middle of this row. The third house, although fairly well  preserved at the time of the survey, was abandoned and falling into  ruin. Adjoining the middle one of these three buildings on the south  side are the outlines of two small compartments, which were evidently  built as corrals for burros and are still used for that purpose.    This village, though limited to two stories in height, has, like the  others of the first mesa, a number of roof holes or trapdoors in the  upper story, an approach to the Zuñi practice. This feature among the  Tusayan villages is probably due to intercourse with the more eastern  pueblos, for it seems to occur chiefly among those having such  communication most frequently. Its presence is probably the result  simply of borrowing a convenient feature from those who invented it to  meet a necessity. The conditions under which the houses were built have  hardly been such as to stimulate the Tusayan to the invention of such a  device. The uniform height of the second-story roofs seen in this  village, constituting an almost unbroken level, is a rather exceptional  feature in pueblo architecture. Only one depression occurs in the whole  length of the main row.    WALPI.

There are numerous  good and reliable introductory works dealing with early Christian art,  besides the greater treatises to which the student who wants to pursue  this line of research shall be directed later on. But there is another  of these original manuals to which we must call attention, as especially  dealing with the practice of monastic artists in the twelfth and  following centuries.    The one to which we now refer is quite distinct from the Greek Manual  which we just mentioned, and by way of contrast may be called the Latin  Manual as being originally composed in that language. Moreover, as the  Greek Manual formed the guide and _vade mecum_ of all the painters of  the Greek Church, so this Latin one became the indispensable monitor in  all Latin foundations. Its origin was German, and said to be the  compilation of a Benedictine monk who is variously spoken of as  Rutgerius, Rugerius, Rotkerius, etc., and assigned by different editors  and critics to either the eleventh, twelfth, or thirteenth centuries.  Probably we shall not be far wrong in placing him about the middle of  the twelfth. The treatise is known as _Diversarum Artium Schedula_, and  the compiler of it calls himself simply _Theophilus presbiter humilis_,  which, of course, records nothing but his personal modesty.    It was at first attributed to Tuotilo of St. Gallen. This opinion was  put forward by Lessing, but it had no foundation whatever beyond the  fact of Tuotilo's well-known versatility.[24] Besides, Tuotilo lived in  the ninth century. But really the question of attributions does not  concern us here. It matters little who he was outside the Treatise, and  certainly we shall not discuss the question further. It is with the  Treatise that we are concerned. We shall simply call the author  Theophilus, and his work the Compendium. Let us turn to it at once.    [24] Tuotilo was renowned throughout all Germany as painter, architect,  preacher, professor, musician, calligrapher, Latinist, Hellenist,  sculptor, and astronomer.    The Compendium, which is thus known to contain the working methods of  all the monastic illuminators, mosaicists, glass painters, enamellers,  and so forth, throughout Germany, Lombardy, and France, consists of  three books, containing altogether one hundred and ninety-five chapters  of definite and special instructions in artistic matters. Book I.,  comprising forty chapters, treats of the preparation, mixture, and use  of colours for wall-painting, panel, and parchment, _i.e._ for the  decoration of churches, furniture, and books. It contains some most  curious and valuable instructions for the employment of gold, silver,  and other metals in the decoration of MSS.; how it should be applied;  whether in leaf or as an ink; how raised and burnished, down to the  minutest details of practice; how colours are to be tempered (_i.e._  mixed); what _media_ or temperings are best for each colour, according  to the surface to which it is to be applied. Such is the Compendium. We  need not, therefore, wonder at its popularity and the estimation in  which it was held.    Thirty-one chapters on glass, glass painting, enamelling, etc., form a  second book, and the third and last book contains some hundred and  twenty-four chapters on gold and silver work--the art of the  goldsmith--in cups, chalices, vases, candelabra, shrines, and so on. It  is the first book that is of most interest to us, and had we space we  would have liked to quote from its pages. But as it is we can only refer  the reader to the work itself. It is to be met with in various forms and  editions. First, we recommend the English translation by Robert Hendrie.  The oldest MS. of the work is one of the twelfth century in the Library  at Wolfenbüttel. The next is in the Imperial Library at Vienna.  Fragments of other copies exist in several other public libraries, but  the completest copy known is that in the Harl.[25] Collection of the  British Museum used by Hendrie as the basis of his translation (8°,  1847).    [25] 1 Harl. MS. 3915.    It was, as we have said, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries  especially that the great abbeys were founded. And it cannot be too  clearly stated that the principal abbatial churches--those most splendid  monuments of architecture whose structure and dimensions are still the  admiration of the most cultured critics, and in which all the rules of  art were so marvellously applied--were the work of simple monks. The  great Church of St. Benignus at Dijon (so often spoken of by writers on  Burgundian art) was built in 1001, under Abbat William, assisted by a  young monk named Hunaldus. The period between 1031 and 1060 saw the  creation of the grand abbatial Church of St. Remi at Reims. In the words  of the Comte de Montalembert: \"From the very beginning of the Monastic  Orders St. Benedict had provided in his Rule that there should be  artists in the monasteries. He had imposed on the exercise of their art  only one condition--humility.\" Hence it is that all we know of the  author of the Compendium from himself is \"humilis presbiter Theophilus.\"  For the same reason Tuotilo and Folchard and Sintramn and the rest are  never anxious to put their names upon their work. For the same reason  the occurrence of an artist's name in a monastic MS. is quite  exceptional and unexpected. The foresight of St. Benedict \"was  accomplished and his law faithfully fulfilled.\" The Benedictine  monasteries soon possessed not only libraries but ateliers, where  architecture, painting, mosaic, sculpture, metal-chasing, calligraphy,  ivory carving, gem-setting, book-binding, and all the branches of  ornamentation were studied and practised with equal care and success,  without interfering in the least with the exact and austere discipline  of the foundation. The teaching of these various arts formed an  essential part of monastic education. \"The greatest and most saintly  abbeys were precisely those most renowned for their zeal in the culture  of Art. St. Gallen in Germany, Monte Cassino in Italy, Cluny in France,  were for centuries the mother-cities of Christian Art.\" And after the  establishment of the reformed colony at Citeaux, the Cistercian Order  became the one above all others which has left the most perfect  edifices, and if the Cistercian illumination may not claim the splendour  of some contemporary examples, it often excels them in soundness of  design and severe correctness of execution.    In saying that all this kind of work was executed by monks, we are  speaking literally. The monks were not only the architects, but also the  masons, and even the hodmen of their edifices. Nor were the superiors in  this respect different from their humble followers. Whilst ordinary  monks were often the architects-in-chief of the constructions, the  abbats voluntarily accepted the rôle of labourers. During the building  of the Abbey of Bee, in 1033, the founder and first abbat,  grand-seigneur though he was, worked as a common mason's labourer,  carrying on his back the lime, sand, and stones necessary for the  builder. This was Herluin. Another Norman noble, Hugh, Abbat of Selby in  Yorkshire, when, in 1096, he rebuilt in stone the whole of that  important monastery, putting on the labourer's blouse, mixed with the  other masons and shared their labours. Monks, illustrious by birth,  distinguished themselves by sharing the most menial occupations. It is  related of Roger de Warenne that when he retired to Evroul, he took up  quite a serious rôle of this kind in cleaning the shoes of the brethren,  and performing other offices which a mere cottager would have probably  considered degrading.    Occasionally in our school histories we come across the mention of a man  like Dunstan, of whom it is related as a wonderful thing that he was at  the same time a metal worker, architect, and calligrapher; but monastic  biographies abound in such instances. We have already quoted several.  \"The same man was frequently,\" says Montalembert, \"architect, goldsmith,  bell-founder, miniaturist, musician, calligrapher, organ builder,  without ceasing to be theologian, preacher, litterateur, sometimes even  bishop, or intimate counsellor of princes.\"[26]    [26] \"L'Art et les Moines,\" _Ann.

In the chapter on Othonian art we saw how the ornamentation of books was  drawn away from the great French centres, and began to take a new  departure from the various leading cities of Germany, such as Bamberg,  which the Othos had made their capital. Whilst the decline, which was  the inevitable consequence of a personal government like that of  Charlemagne, took place in France, it was but natural that the new  artistic movement at Bamberg should become the fashion, and Germany  predominant in art, as she was in politics. In the twelfth century the  German Empire was the principal power in Europe. France, Italy, England,  and Spain were all more or less secondary. Italy, however, was already  on the alert. She was initiating certain movements in social life that  must soon withdraw the cultivation of all the arts from the control of  the monasteries. At the same time the love of learning and personal  accomplishments of the second and third Othos and (St.) Henry II. soon  prepared the Imperial Court to become as brilliant as classical  scholarship and artistic skill of the highest class could make it.
