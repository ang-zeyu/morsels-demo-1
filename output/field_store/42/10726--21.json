In spite of a heavy top-coat of  smoke, the combination of cherubs, birds, grapes, and foliage is as  graceful and artistic as possible; and the work beneath the east end  and north transept windows will also well repay careful study. These  details are apt to be neglected, possibly because they seem dwarfed by  the immense proportions of the building.[83]    The North and South Chapels, as we hear on probably trustworthy  authority, were added at the instance of James, Duke of York, who  looked forward to the day when the Roman Catholic services would be  substituted for the Anglican. Although Stephen is silent as to his  grandfather's intentions, there is evidence given by Mr. Longman and  Miss Lucy Phillimore to show that Wren tried his best to finish the  building without them. Whether seen from the north-east or south-west  they interfere with the perspective, and the independence of the  lowest stage of the West Towers is completely lost; and curiously  enough in this last respect the South-West or Consistory Chapel does  very much what St. Gregory's did to the Lollards' Tower in Old St.  Paul's.    We now turn to the different parts and members.    =North and South Fronts.=--These are similar, each part corresponding  to each, excepting a slight difference in the steps of the porticoes  caused by the ground on the south side sloping towards the Thames; and  this uniformity or symmetry is invariably carried out in the different  parts wherever feasible. Take the three main windows of the choir  aisles on either side, and compare them with the three of the nave  aisles on either side between the transepts and the chapels. The  windows themselves and their pilasters exactly agree, as do their  distances.    Where the uniformity of the fronts is broken by the projecting  transepts and chapels, it is broken after one manner, so that when you  have seen the north side you have seen the south, excepting for the  above-mentioned difference caused by the slope.    The North and South Fronts are approached by flights of steps of black  marble. The steps on the north side are twelve in number, and are  reached from the whole semi-circle; on the south side they are  twenty-five in number, and are reached from the ends, the front having  a low wall. Here, the flanking urns on either side afford another  instance of the disregard of Wren's wishes. The difference in the  number of the steps is caused by the slope towards the Thames, and is  interesting as affording an instance of a difference between the two  fronts. The Corinthian pillars, of the full diameter of four feet,  cleverly support the semi-circular entablature above, which is part of  the general entablature continued all round. These porticoes have  semi-dome shaped roofs, and are flanked on either side by the windows  of the transept aisles. The central windows above the porticoes are  slightly larger than the others, and have niches on either side. Above  these are triangular pediments, and above these again, and in  alignment along the balustrade, are statues of ten of the  Apostles--five to each front. The sculpture on the northern pediment  depicts the royal arms, with angels bearing palm branches for  supporters, and on the southern is a Phoenix with the motto  \"Resurgam.\"       [Illustration: NORTH-EAST VIEW OF ST. PAUL'S.]    By universal consent these facades are admirable in the justness of  their proportions, and the harmonious way in which they blend both  with the west front and the entire building. Caius Gabriel Cibber  received six pounds for modelling and a hundred pounds for carving the  Phoenix.    =The East End.=--The Apse was intended for the reception of the altar.  It has three windows in either stage. Underneath the lower central  window is a crown, with cypher of William and Mary, surrounded by the  garter. This device was intended to show in whose reign the choir was  built. It was probably correct when put up; but poor Mary died before  the completion. The apse is of the breadth of the centre, and on  either side are the windows of the aisles, while the central one in  the basement belongs to the Crypt Chapel. There is nothing very  striking or remarkable in this part, the details being similar to the  rest of the church. Very different is the case with our next feature  of interest.    =The West Front.=--The best view is that from the direct front; but by  looking from the north or south-west the conjunction of the chapels  comes in sight, and the spectator can judge for himself whether or no,  so far as the exterior is concerned, they are any improvement. A few  additional dimensions are necessary. The summits of the towers are 222  feet high; the statue of St. Paul above the apex of the pediment is  135 feet. I have already given prominence to the cause of the defeat  of Wren's original conception of one main order and an attic, namely,  that he could not get blocks of stone of a sufficient size. The  Approved Design, so far as the colonnade is concerned, seems to have  been borrowed from the portico of Inigo Jones. The dimensions of the  blocks had been discovered, yet there was only one order of columns,  with a second story of three windows, and supported by Inigo Jones'  harp-shaped buttresses; the only buttresses that Wren even wished to  have visible. Now, the old portico was not cleared away until 1686;  and the west front was built after Wren's taste and judgment had been  given time to ripen. In consequence we have a complete revolution, so  far as the Approved Design is concerned, and something infinitely more  noble and dignified; and we may congratulate ourselves that his blocks  of stone were no larger, so that he produced two orders of columns. At  St. Peter's, where marble of 9 feet (8-1/4 only according to more  recent accounts) was used, the pillars have a shaft of 74 feet, not  including capital or base, and the highest statue is 175 feet from the  base, as compared with the 135 feet of St. Paul's.[84] Yet Wren, by  resorting to two orders of columns, has so increased his apparent  height, that those who have compared the two, assert that the west  front of St. Paul's _appears_ to be as high as St. Peter's.    In the lower order the columns are twelve in number, fluted and in  pairs. Claude Perrault had recently adopted this method of coupling in  the eastern facade of the Louvre, as is duly acknowledged in the  \"Parentalia.\" According to Stephen Wren, it \"_is not according to the  usual Mode of the_ Ancients _in their ordinary Temples, which for the  generality were small; but was followed in their Coloss or greater  Works; for instance, in the Portico of the_ Temple of Peace, _the most  magnificent in old_ Rome, _the Columns were very properly and  necessarily doubled to make wider openings._\" Italian buildings are  likewise cited. The columns project slightly in advance of the Front;  and as the central part with the great doorway is recessed some twenty  feet, a depth of shadow is produced in the Pronaos.    As the great doorway for \"Solemnities\" requires a wider opening in  front than the two side ones in daily use, the two central pairs are  placed _Eustyle_--_i.e._, with a supposed space between of two and a  half diameters--while the rest are placed _Pycnostyle_--one and a half  diameters.[85] In the second story, owing to the towers above, the  outside couples are displaced by pilasters; and the eight remaining  columns support the architrave and cornice, and the great triangular  pediment above of seventy-four feet in breadth and eighteen in height.  On this is represented in bas-relief the Conversion of St. Paul. Saul  of Tarsus still seated on his horse, which is crouching on the ground,  looks up at the rays of light; and the alarmed escort are trying to  control their frightened steeds. In the distance is Damascus. The  sculpture is the work of Francis Bird, and he was paid for it the  handsome sum of L650. The statue on the apex is that of the patronal  saint; the two near him are those of St. Peter and St. James, while  the four more remote are those of the Evangelists, with their emblems  taken from Rev. iv. 7.    The Towers, with their Italian details, complete the Facade. They  consist of five stages besides the domes, of which the two lower  correspond with the rest of the front. The third is pierced with  circular openings, which in the southern are filled up with the faces  of the clock. The fourth is transitional between the square and the  octagon; from each angle of the square below spring two pairs of  Corinthian columns, half-concealing, half-revealing the supports of  the small domes. The fifth is an octagon, with two orders of open  arches in each face, and an exterior arcading, urn-shaped pedestals  being freely adopted as in the stage below. The domes, the pine of  which was modelled by Francis Bird, is designed with curves of  contrary flexure for the purpose of adding to the height. Mr. Longman  likens these towers to Alpine aiguilles, and points out how  picturesquely they form outposts to the great mass of the dome.    Both towers are used as campaniles. The north contains the \"five  minutes\" bell, and the new peal, numbering twelve. The southern  contains the three bells on which the clock is struck; and the largest  of these, weighing 5 tons 4 cwt., is the passing bell on great  occasions. On June 3, 1882, the citizens heard for the first time  their new Great Paul. This monster, weighing nearly seventeen tons,  came from the foundry of Messrs. Taylor, at Loughborough, and its  progress by road was duly chronicled like that of some great  personage. It was placed in the south tower, and is reckoned amongst  the largest bells in the world. Part of the magnificent railings,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25267"],[0,"Astronomy for Amateurs (#17)"],[1," of the planet.  But the circulation of the water, so important to terrestrial life,  whether animal or vegetable, which is effected upon our planet by the  evaporation of the seas, clouds, winds, rains, wells, rivers and  streams, comes about quite differently on Mars; for, as was remarked  above, it is rarely that any clouds are observed there. Instead of being  vertical, as here, this circulation is horizontal: the water coming from  the source of the polar snows finds its way into the canals and seas,  and returns to be condensed at the poles by a light drift of invisible  vapors directed from the equator to the poles. There is never any rain.    We have spoken of _canals_. One of the great puzzles of the Martian  world is incontestably the appearance of straight lines that furrow its  surface in all directions, and seem to connect the seas. M.  Schiaparelli, the distinguished Director of the Observatory of Milan,  who discovered them in 1877, called them canals, without, however,  postulating anything as to their real nature. Are they indeed canals?  These straight lines, measuring sometimes 600 kilometers (372 miles) in  length, and more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in breadth, have much  the same hue as the seas on which they open. For a quarter of a century  they have been surveyed by the greater number of our observers. But it  must be confessed that, even with the best instruments, we only approach  Mars at a distance of 60,000 kilometers (37,200 miles), which is still a  little far off, and we may be sure that we do not distinguish the true  details of the surface.[11] These details at the limits of visibility  produce the appearance of canals to our eyes. They may possibly be lines  of lakes, or oases. The future will no doubt clear up this mystery for  us.    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Chart of Mars.]    As to the inhabitants of Mars, this world is in a situation as  favorable as our Earth for habitation, and it would be difficult to  discover any reason for perpetual sterility there. It appears to us, on  the contrary, by its rapid and frequent variations of aspect, to be a  very living world. Its atmosphere, which is always clear, has not the  density of our own, and resembles that of the highest mountains. The  conditions of existence there vary from ours, and appear to be more  delicate, more ethereal.    There as here, day succeeds to night, spring softens the rigors of  winter; the seasons unfold, less disparate than our own, of which we  have such frequent reason to complain. The sky is perpetually clear.  There are never tempests, hurricanes, nor cyclones, the wind never gets  up any force there, on account of the rarity of the atmosphere, and the  low intensity of weight.    Differing from ours, this world may well be a more congenial  habitation. It is more ancient than the Earth, smaller, less massive. It  has run more quickly through the phases of its evolution. Its astral  life is more advanced, and its Humanity should be superior to our own,  just as our successors a million years hence, for example, will be less  coarse and barbarous than we are at present: the law of progress governs  all the worlds, and, moreover, the physical constitution of the planet  Mars is less dense than our own.    There is no need to despair of entering some day into communication with  these unknown beings. The luminous points that have been observed are no  signals, but high summits or light clouds illuminated by the rising or  setting sun. But the idea of communication with them in the future is no  more audacious and no less scientific than the invention of spectral  analysis, X-rays, or wireless telegraphy.    We may suppose that the study of astronomy is further advanced in Mars  than on the Earth, because humanity itself has advanced further, and  because the starry sky is far finer there, far easier to study, owing to  the limpidity of its pure, clear atmosphere.    Two small moons (hardly larger than the city of Paris) revolve rapidly  round Mars; they are called Phobos and Deimos. The former, at a distance  of 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) from the surface, accomplishes its  revolution rapidly, in seven hours, thirty-nine minutes, and thus makes  the entire circle of the Heavens three times a day. The second  gravitates at 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles), and turns round its  center of attraction in thirty hours and eighteen minutes. These two  satellites were discovered by Mr. Hall, at the University of Washington,  in the month of August, 1877.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the finest and most interesting of the celestial phenomena admired  by the Martians, at certain epochs of the year,--now at night when the  Sun has plunged into his fiery bed, now in the morning, a little before  the aurora,--is a magnificent star of first magnitude, never far removed  from the orb of day, which presents to them the same aspects as does  Venus to ourselves. This splendid orb, which has doubtless received the  most flattering names from those who contemplate it, this radiant star  of a beautiful greenish blue, courses in space accompanied by a little  satellite, sparkling like some splendid diamond, after sunset, in the  clear sky of Mars. This superb orb is the Earth, and the little star  accompanying it is the Moon.    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--The Earth viewed from Mars.]    Yes, to the Martians our Earth is a star of the morning and evening;  doubtless they have determined her phases. Many a vow, and many a hope  must have been wafted toward her, more than one broken heart must have  permitted its unrealized dreams to wander forth to our planet as to an  abode of happiness where all who have suffered in their native world  might find a haven. But our planet, alas! is not as perfect as they  imagine.    We must not dally upon Mars, but hasten our celestial excursion toward  Jupiter.          CHAPTER VI    THE PLANETS    _B._--JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, NEPTUNE.      Before we attack the giant world of our system, we must halt for a few  moments upon the minor planets which circulate between the orbit of Mars  and that of Jupiter. These minute asters, little worlds, the largest of  which measures scarcely more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in diameter,  are fragments of cosmic matter that once belonged to a vast ring, formed  at the time when the solar system was only an immense nebula; and which,  instead of condensing into a single globe coursing between Mars and  Jupiter, split up into a considerable quantity of particles constituting  at the present time the curious and highly interesting Republic of the  Asteroids.    These lilliputian worlds at first received the names of the more  celebrated of the minor mythological divinities--Ceres, Pallas, Juno,  Vesta, etc., but as they rapidly increased in number, it was found  necessary to call them by modern, terrestrial names, and more than one  daughter of Eve, the Egeria of some astronomer, now has her name  inscribed in the Heavens. The first minor planet was discovered on the  first day of the nineteenth century, January 1, 1801, by Piazzi,  astronomer at Palermo. While he was observing the small stars in the  constellation of the Bull beneath the clear Sicilian skies, this famous  astronomer noticed one that he had never seen before.    The next night, directing his telescope to the same part of the Heavens,  he perceived that the fair unknown had moved her station, and the  observations of the following days left him no doubt as to the nature of  the visitor: she was a planet, a wandering star among the  constellations, revolving round the Sun. This newcomer was registered  under the name of Ceres.    Since that epoch several hundreds of them have been discovered,  occupying a zone that extends over a space of more than 400 million  kilometers (249,000,000 miles). These celestial globules are invisible  to the naked eye, but no year passes without new and numerous recruits  being added to the already important catalogue of these minute asters by  the patient observers of the Heavens. To-day, they are most frequently  discovered by the photographic method of following the displacement of  the tiny moving points upon an exposed sensitive plate.      JUPITER    And now let us bow respectfully before Jupiter, the giant of the worlds.  This glorious planet is indeed King of the Solar System.    While Mercury measures only 4,750 kilometers (2,946 miles) in diameter,  and Mars 6,728 kilometers (4,172), Jupiter is no less than 140,920  kilometers (87,400 miles) in breadth; that is to say, eleven times  larger than the Earth. He is 442,500 kilometers (274,357 miles) in  circumference.    In volume he is equivalent to 1,279 terrestrial globes; hence he is only  a million times smaller than the Sun. The previously described planets  of our system, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars combined, would form  only an insignificant mass in comparison with this colossus. A hundred  and twenty-six Earths joined into one group would present a surface  whose extent would still not be quite as vast as the superficies of this  titanic world. This immense globe weighs 310 times more than that which  we inhabit. Its density is only the quarter of our own; but weight is  twice and a half times as great there as here. The constituents of  things and beings are thus composed of materials lighter than those upon  the Earth; but, as the planet exerts a force of attraction twice and a  half times as powerful, they are in reality heavier and weigh more. A  graceful maiden weighing fifty kilograms would if transported to Jupiter  immediately be included in the imposing society of the \"Hundred Kilos.\"    Jupiter rotates upon himself with prodigious rapidity. He accomplishes  his diurnal revolution in less than ten hours! There the day lasts half  as long as here, and while we reckoned fifteen days upon our calendar,  the Jovian would count thirty-six.
