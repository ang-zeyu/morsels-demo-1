I do not ask thee that.    Take him up, if thou tender thine own life,    And bear him where the lady Julia    Was wont to lodge.--O, my fate moves swift!    I have this cardinal in the forge already;    Now I 'll bring him to th' hammer.  O direful misprision![136]    I will not imitate things glorious.    No more than base; I 'll be mine own example.--    On, on, and look thou represent, for silence,    The thing thou bear'st.[137]         Exeunt.             Scene V[138]           [Enter] CARDINAL, with a book      CARDINAL.  I am puzzl'd in a question about hell;    He says, in hell there 's one material fire,    And yet it shall not burn all men alike.    Lay him by.  How tedious is a guilty conscience!    When I look into the fish-ponds in my garden,    Methinks I see a thing arm'd with a rake,    That seems to strike at me.         [Enter BOSOLA, and Servant bearing ANTONIO'S body]                                 Now, art thou come?    Thou look'st ghastly;    There sits in thy face some great determination    Mix'd with some fear.      BOSOLA.                Thus it lightens into action:    I am come to kill thee.      CARDINAL.                Ha!--Help! our guard!      BOSOLA.  Thou art deceiv'd; they are out of thy howling.      CARDINAL.  Hold; and I will faithfully divide    Revenues with thee.      BOSOLA.              Thy prayers and proffers    Are both unseasonable.      CARDINAL.               Raise the watch!    We are betray'd!      BOSOLA.           I have confin'd your flight:    I 'll suffer your retreat to Julia's chamber,    But no further.      CARDINAL.        Help! we are betray'd!           [Enter, above, PESCARA, MALATESTI, RODERIGO, and GRISOLAN]      MALATESTI.  Listen.      CARDINAL.  My dukedom for rescue!      RODERIGO.  Fie upon his counterfeiting!      MALATESTI.  Why, 'tis not the cardinal.      RODERIGO.  Yes, yes, 'tis he:    But, I 'll see him hang'd ere I 'll go down to him.      CARDINAL.  Here 's a plot upon me; I am assaulted!  I am lost,    Unless some rescue!      GRISOLAN.            He doth this pretty well;    But it will not serve to laugh me out of mine honour.      CARDINAL.  The sword's at my throat!      RODERIGO.                             You would not bawl so loud then.      MALATESTI.    Come, come, let 's go to bed:  he told us this much aforehand.      PESCARA.  He wish'd you should not come at him; but, believe 't,    The accent of the voice sounds not in jest:    I 'll down to him, howsoever, and with engines    Force ope the doors.         [Exit above.]      RODERIGO.             Let 's follow him aloof,    And note how the cardinal will laugh at him.         [Exeunt, above, MALATESTI, RODERIGO, and GRISOLAN.]      BOSOLA.  There 's for you first,    'Cause you shall not unbarricade the door    To let in rescue.         Kills the Servant.      CARDINAL.  What cause hast thou to pursue my life?      BOSOLA.                                             Look there.      CARDINAL.  Antonio!      BOSOLA.              Slain by my hand unwittingly.    Pray, and be sudden.  When thou kill'd'st thy sister,    Thou took'st from Justice her most equal balance,    And left her naught but her sword.      CARDINAL.                           O, mercy!      BOSOLA.  Now it seems thy greatness was only outward;    For thou fall'st faster of thyself than calamity    Can drive thee.  I 'll not waste longer time; there!         [Stabs him.]      CARDINAL.  Thou hast hurt me.      BOSOLA.                        Again!      CARDINAL.                              Shall I die like a leveret,    Without any resistance?--Help, help, help!    I am slain!           [Enter FERDINAND]      FERDINAND.    Th' alarum!  Give me a fresh horse;    Rally the vaunt-guard, or the day is lost,    Yield, yield!  I give you the honour of arms    Shake my sword over you; will you yield?      CARDINAL.  Help me; I am your brother!      FERDINAND.                              The devil!    My brother fight upon the adverse party!         He wounds the CARDINAL, and, in the scuffle, gives BOSOLA         his death-wound.    There flies your ransom.      CARDINAL.  O justice!    I suffer now for what hath former bin:    Sorrow is held the eldest child of sin.      FERDINAND.  Now you 're brave fellows.  Caesar's fortune was harder    than Pompey's; Caesar died in the arms of prosperity, Pompey at the    feet of disgrace.  You both died in the field.  The pain 's nothing;    pain many times is taken away with the apprehension of greater,    as the tooth-ache with the sight of a barber that comes to pull    it out.  There 's philosophy for you.      BOSOLA.  Now my revenge is perfect.--Sink, thou main cause         Kills FERDINAND.    Of my undoing!--The last part of my life    Hath done me best service.      FERDINAND.  Give me some wet hay; I am broken-winded.    I do account this world but a dog-kennel:    I will vault credit and affect high pleasures    Beyond death.      BOSOLA.        He seems to come to himself,    Now he 's so near the bottom.      FERDINAND.  My sister, O my sister! there 's the cause on 't.    Whether we fall by ambition, blood, or lust,    Like diamonds, we are cut with our own dust.         [Dies.]      CARDINAL.  Thou hast thy payment too.      BOSOLA.  Yes, I hold my weary soul in my teeth;    'Tis ready to part from me.  I do glory    That thou, which stood'st like a huge pyramid    Begun upon a large and ample base,    Shalt end in a little point, a kind of nothing.           [Enter, below, PESCARA, MALATESTI, RODERIGO, and GRISOLAN]      PESCARA.  How now, my lord!      MALATESTI.                   O sad disaster!      RODERIGO.                                     How comes this?      BOSOLA.  Revenge for the Duchess of Malfi murdered    By the Arragonian brethren; for Antonio    Slain by this hand; for lustful Julia    Poison'd by this man; and lastly for myself,    That was an actor in the main of all    Much 'gainst mine own good nature, yet i' the end    Neglected.      PESCARA.    How now, my lord!      CARDINAL.                      Look to my brother:    He gave us these large wounds, as we were struggling    Here i' th' rushes.  And now, I pray, let me    Be laid by and never thought of.         [Dies.]      PESCARA.  How fatally, it seems, he did withstand    His own rescue!      MALATESTI.       Thou wretched thing of blood,    How came Antonio by his death?      BOSOLA.  In a mist; I know not how:    Such a mistake as I have often seen    In a play.  O, I am gone!    We are only like dead walls or vaulted graves,    That, ruin'd, yield no echo.  Fare you well.    It may be pain, but no harm, to me to die    In so good a quarrel.  O, this gloomy world!    In what a shadow, or deep pit of darkness,    Doth womanish and fearful mankind live!    Let worthy minds ne'er stagger in distrust    To suffer death or shame for what is just:    Mine is another voyage.         [Dies.]      PESCARA.  The noble Delio, as I came to th' palace,    Told me of Antonio's being here, and show'd me    A pretty gentleman, his son and heir.           [Enter DELIO, and ANTONIO'S Son]      MALATESTI.  O sir, you come too late!      DELIO.                                 I heard so, and    Was arm'd for 't, ere I came.  Let us make noble use    Of this great ruin; and join all our force    To establish this young hopeful gentleman    In 's mother's right.  These wretched eminent things    Leave no more fame behind 'em, than should one    Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow;    As soon as the sun shines, it ever melts,    Both form and matter.  I have ever thought    Nature doth nothing so great for great men    As when she 's pleas'd to make them lords of truth:    Integrity of life is fame's best friend,    Which nobly, beyond death, shall crown the end.         Exeunt.        FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Malfi.

Strong winds sweep over the vast stretches of open upland, checked  by no belts of forest. It is a country whose aspect has little to  attract the settler. No one would think it worth fighting for so far as  the surface goes; and until sixteen years ago nobody knew that there was  enormous wealth lying below the surface.      BRITISH TERRITORIES--BECHUANALAND    Of one British territory outside the two colonies, viz., Basutoland, I  shall have to speak fully hereafter. A second, Bechuanaland, including  the Kalahari Desert, is of vast extent, but slender value. It is a level  land lying entirely on the plateau between 3,000 and 4000 feet above the  sea, and while some of its streamlets drain into the Limpopo, and so to  the Indian Ocean, others flow westward and northward into marshes and  shallow lakes, in which they disappear. One or two, however, succeed, in  wet seasons, in getting as far as the Orange River, and find through it  an outlet to the sea. It is only in the wet season that the streamlets  flow, for Bechuanaland is intensely dry. I travelled four hundred miles  through it without once crossing running water, though here and there in  traversing the dry bed of a brook one was told that there was water  underneath, deep in the sand. Notwithstanding this superficial aridity,  eastern Bechuanaland is deemed one of the best ranching tracts in South  Africa, for the grass is sweet, and the water can usually be obtained by  digging, though it is often brackish. There is also plenty of wood--thin  and thorny, but sufficiently abundant to diversify the aspect of what  would otherwise be a most dreary and monotonous region.      THE TERRITORIES OF THE BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA COMPANY    North of Bechuanaland and the Transvaal, and stretching all the way to  the Zambesi, are those immense territories which have been assigned to  the British South Africa Company as the sphere of its operations, and to  which the name of Rhodesia has been given. Matabililand and Mashonaland,  the only parts that have been at all settled, are higher, more  undulating, and altogether more attractive than Bechuanaland, with great  swelling downs somewhat resembling the Steppes of Southern Russia or the  prairies of Kansas. Except in the east and south-east, the land is  undulating rather than hilly, but in the south-west, towards the Upper  Limpopo, there lies a high region, full of small rocky heights often  clothed with thick bush--a country difficult to traverse, as has been  found during the recent native outbreak; for it was there that most of  the Kafirs took shelter and were found difficult to dislodge. Towards  the south-east, along the middle course of the Limpopo, the country is  lower and less healthy. On the northern side of the central highlands,  the ground sinks towards the Zambesi, and the soil, which among the  hills is thin or sandy, becomes deeper. In that part and along the river  banks there are great possibilities of agricultural development, while  the uplands, where the subjacent rock is granite or gneiss, with  occasional beds of slate or schist, are generally barer and more dry,  fit rather for pasture than for tillage. More rain falls than in  Bechuanaland, so it is only at the end of the dry season, in October,  that the grass begins to fail on the pastures. The climate, though very  warm,--for here we are well within the tropics,--is pleasant and  invigorating, for nowhere do brighter and fresher breezes blow, and the  heat of the afternoons is forgotten in the cool evenings. It is  healthy, too, except along the swampy river banks and where one descends  to the levels of the Zambesi, or into the Limpopo Valley.    The reader will have gathered from this general sketch that there are no  natural boundaries severing from one another the various political  divisions of South Africa. The north-eastern part of Cape Colony is  substantially the same kind of country as the Orange Free State and  Eastern Bechuanaland; the Transvaal, or at least three-fourths of its  area, is physically similar to the Free State; the boundary between Cape  Colony and Natal is an artificial one; while Matabililand and  Mashonaland present features resembling those of the Northern Transvaal,  differing only in being rather hotter and rather better watered. So far  as nature is concerned, the conditions she prescribes for the life of  man, the resources she opens to his energies, are very similar over  these wide areas, save, of course, that some parts are much richer than  others in mineral deposits. It is only along the frontier line which  divides Natal and the Portuguese dominions from the Transvaal and the  territories of the British South Africa Company that a political  coincides with a physical line of demarcation. Even German South-west  Africa differs scarcely at all from the Kalahari Desert, which adjoins  it and which forms the western part of Bechuanaland, and differs little  also from the north-western regions of Cape Colony. If the reader will  compare the two physical maps contained in this volume with the map  which shows the political divisions of the country he will notice that  these political divisions do not correspond with the areas where more or  less rain falls, or where the ground is more or less raised above the  sea or traversed by mountain chains. The only exception is to be found  in the fact that the boundary of Natal towards Basutoland and the Orange  Free State has been drawn along the watershed between the Indian Ocean  and the Atlantic, and that the boundary line between the Portuguese  territories and those of the Transvaal Republic and of the British South  Africa Company, is in many places the line of division between the  mountains and the low country. The Orange River and the Limpopo have, in  parts of their courses, been taken as convenient political frontiers.  But rivers, though convenient for this purpose to the statesman and the  geographer, are not natural boundaries in the true sense of the term.  And thus we may say that the causes which have cut up South Africa into  its present Colonies and States have been (except as aforesaid)  historical causes, rather than differences due to the hand of nature.          CHAPTER VI    NATURE AND HISTORY      Now that some general idea of how nature has shaped and moulded South  Africa has been conveyed to the reader, a few pages may be devoted to  considering what influence on the fortunes of the country and its  inhabitants has been exerted by its physical character. The history of  every country may be regarded as the joint result of three factors--the  natural conditions of the country itself, the qualities of the races  that have occupied it, and the circumstances under which their  occupation took place. And among savage or barbarous people natural  conditions have an even greater importance than they have in more  advanced periods of civilisation, because they are more powerful as  against man. Man in his savage state is not yet able to resist such  conditions or to turn them to serve his purposes, but is condemned to  submit to the kind of life which they prescribe.    This was the case with the first inhabitants of South Africa. They seem  to have entered it as savages, and savages they remained. Nature was  strong and stern; she spread before them no such rich alluvial plains as  tempted cultivation in the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates.  Intellectually feeble, and without the patience or the foresight to  attempt to till the soil in a land where droughts are frequent and  disastrous, the Bushmen were content with killing game, and the  Hottentots with living on the milk of their cattle. Such a life, which  was one of uncertainty and often of hardship, permitted no accumulation  of wealth, gave no leisure, suggested no higher want than that of food,  and was in all respects unfavourable to material progress. Even the  Bantu people, who probably came later and were certainly more advanced,  for they carried on some little cultivation of the soil, remained at a  low level. Nature gave them, except in dry years, as much corn as they  needed in return for very little labour. Clothing they did not need, and  their isolation from the rest of the world left them ignorant of  luxuries. When the European voyagers found them at the end of the  fifteenth century, they were making little or no advance in the arts of  life.    Upon the growth of European settlements the influence of the physical  structure of the country has been very marked. When the Portuguese had  followed the long line of coast from the mouth of the Orange River to  that of the Zambesi, and from the mouth of the Zambesi northward to  Zanzibar, they settled only where they heard that gold and ivory could  be obtained. Their forts and trading stations, the first of which dates  from 1505, were therefore planted on the coast northward from the  Limpopo River. Sofala, a little south of the modern port of Beira, was  the principal one. Here they traded, and twice or thrice they made,  always in search of the gold-producing regions, expeditions inland.  These expeditions, however, had to traverse the flat and malarious strip  of ground which lies along the Indian Ocean. A large part of the white  troops died, and the rest arrived at the higher ground so much weakened  that they could achieve no permanent conquests, for they were opposed by  warlike tribes. In the course of years a small population speaking  Portuguese, though mixed with native blood, grew up along the coast. The  climate, however, destroyed what vigour the whites had brought from  Europe, and by degrees they ceased to even attempt to conquer or occupy  the interior. The heat and the rains, together with fever, the offspring  of heat and rains, checked further progress. Three"]]]
