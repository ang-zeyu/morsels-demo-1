I just wish I was Lizzie.\"    Charlotte shook her head. \"I don't. I'd love to be adopted, but I  wouldn't really like to be anybody but myself, even if I am homely.  It's better to be yourself with mousy hair and freckles than somebody  else who is ever so beautiful. But I do envy Lizzie, though the  matron says it is wicked to envy anyone.\"    Envy of the fortunate Lizzie did not long possess Charlotte's mind,  however, for that very day a wonderful thing happened at noon hour by  the northwest gap. Charlotte had always been very careful not to let  the Pretty Lady see her, but today, after the Pretty Lady had gone  past, Charlotte leaned out of the gap to watch her as far as she  could. And just at that very moment the Pretty Lady looked back; and  there, peering at her from the asylum fence, was a little scrap of a  girl, with mouse-coloured hair and big freckles, and the sweetest,  brightest, most winsome little face the Pretty Lady had ever seen. The  Pretty Lady smiled right down at Charlotte and for just a moment her  eyes looked as Charlotte had always known they ought to look.  Charlotte was feeling rather frightened down in her heart but she  smiled bravely back.    \"Are you thinking of running away?\" said the Pretty Lady, and, oh,  what a sweet voice she had--sweet and tender, just like a mother's  voice ought to be!    \"No,\" said Charlotte, shaking her head gravely. \"I should like to run  away but it would be of no use, because there is no place to run to.\"    \"Why would you like to run away?\" asked the Pretty Lady, still  smiling. \"Don't you like living here?\"    Charlotte opened her big eyes very widely. \"Why, it's an orphan  asylum!\" she exclaimed. \"Nobody could like living in an orphan asylum.  But, of course, orphans should be very thankful to have any place to  live in and I _am_ thankful. I'd be thankfuller still if the matron  wouldn't make me take sulphur and molasses. If you had a little girl,  would you make her take sulphur and molasses?\"    \"I didn't when I had a little girl,\" said the Pretty Lady wistfully,  and her eyes were sad again.    \"Oh, did you really have a little girl once?\" asked Charlotte softly.    \"Yes, and she died,\" said the Pretty Lady in a trembling voice.    \"Oh, I am sorry,\" said Charlotte, more softly still. \"Did she--did she  have lovely golden hair and pink cheeks like yours?\"    \"No,\" the Pretty Lady smiled again, though it was a very sad smile.  \"No, she had mouse-coloured hair and freckles.\"    \"Oh! And weren't you sorry?\"    \"No, I was glad of it, because it made her look like her father. I've  always loved little girls with mouse-coloured hair and freckles ever  since. Well, I must hurry along. I'm late now, and schools have a  dreadful habit of going in sharp on time. If you should happen to be  here tomorrow, I'm going to stop and ask your name.\"    Of course Charlotte was at the gap the next day and they had a lovely  talk. In a week they were the best of friends. Charlotte soon found  out that she could make the Pretty Lady's eyes look as they ought to  for a little while at least, and she spent all her spare time and lay  awake at nights devising speeches to make the Pretty Lady laugh.    Then another wonderful thing happened. One evening when Charlotte went  to the southeast gap, the Tall Lady with the Black Eyes was not in the  garden--at least, Charlotte thought she wasn't. But the Very Handsome  Cat was, sitting gravely under a syringa bush and looking quite proud  of himself for being a cat.    \"You Very Handsome Cat,\" said Charlotte, \"won't you come here and let  me stroke you?\"    The Very Handsome Cat did come, just as if he understood English, and  he purred with delight when Charlotte took him in her arms and buried  her face in his fur. Then--Charlotte thought she would really sink  into the ground, for the Tall Lady herself came around a lilac bush  and stood before the gap.    \"Please, ma'am,\" stammered Charlotte in an agony of embarrassment, \"I  wasn't meaning to do any harm to your Very Handsome Cat. I just wanted  to pat him. I--I am very fond of cats and they are not allowed in  orphan asylums.\"    \"I've always thought asylums weren't run on proper principles,\" said  the Tall Lady briskly. \"Bless your heart, child, don't look so scared.  You're welcome to pat the cat all you like. Come in and I'll give you  some flowers.\"    \"Thank you, but I am not allowed to go off the grounds,\" said  Charlotte firmly, \"and I think I'd rather not have any flowers because  the matron might want to know where I got them, and then she would  have this gap closed up. I live in mortal dread for fear it will be  closed anyhow. It's very uncomfortable--living in mortal dread.\"    The Tall Lady laughed a very jolly laugh. \"Yes, I should think it  would be,\" she agreed. \"I haven't had that experience.\"    Then they had a jolly talk, and every evening after that Charlotte  went to the gap and stroked the Very Handsome Cat and chatted to the  Tall Lady.    \"Do you live all alone in that big house?\" she asked wonderingly one  day.    \"All alone,\" said the Tall Lady.    \"Did you always live alone?\"    \"No. I had a sister living with me once. But I don't want to talk  about her. You'll oblige me, Charlotte, by _not_ talking about her.\"    \"I won't then,\" agreed Charlotte. \"I can understand why people don't  like to have their sisters talked about sometimes. Lily Mitchell has a  big sister who was sent to jail for stealing. Of course Lily doesn't  like to talk about her.\"    The Tall Lady laughed a little bitterly. \"My sister didn't steal. She  married a man I detested, that's all.\"    \"Did he drink?\" asked Charlotte gravely. \"The matron's husband drank  and that was why she left him and took to running an orphan asylum. I  think I'd rather put up with a drunken husband than live in an orphan  asylum.\"    \"My sister's husband didn't drink,\" said the Tall Lady grimly. \"He was  beneath her, that was all. I told her I'd never forgive her and I  never shall. He's dead now--he died a year after she married him--and  she's working for her living. I dare say she doesn't find it very  pleasant. She wasn't brought up to that. Here, Charlotte, is a  turnover for you. I made it on purpose for you. Eat it and tell me if  you don't think I'm a good cook. I'm dying for a compliment. I never  get any now that I've got old. It's a dismal thing to get old and have  nobody to love you except a cat, Charlotte.\"    \"I think it is just as bad to be young and have nobody to love you,  not _even_ a cat,\" sighed Charlotte, enjoying the turnover,  nevertheless.    \"I dare say it is,\" agreed the Tall Lady, looking as if she had been  struck by a new and rather startling idea.           *       *       *       *       *    I like the tall lady with the Black Eyes ever so much, thought  Charlotte that night as she lay in bed, but I love the Pretty Lady. I  have more fun with the Tall Lady and the Very Handsome Cat, but I  always feel nicer with the Pretty Lady. Oh, I'm so glad her little  girl had mouse-coloured hair.    Then the most wonderful thing of all happened. One day a week later  the Pretty Lady said, \"Would you like to come and live with me,  Charlotte?\"    Charlotte looked at her. \"Are you in earnest?\" she asked in a whisper.    \"Indeed I am. I want you for my little girl, and if you'd like to  come, you shall. I'm poor, Charlotte, really, I'm dreadfully poor, but  I can make my salary stretch far enough for two, and we'll love each  other enough to cover the thin spots. Will you come?\"    \"Well, I should just think I will!\" said Charlotte emphatically. \"Oh,  I wish I was sure I'm not dreaming. I do love you so much, and it will  be so delightful to be your little girl.\"    \"Very well, sweetheart. I'll come tomorrow afternoon--it is Saturday,  so I'll have the whole blessed day off--and see the matron about it.  Oh, we'll have lovely times together, dearest. I only wish I'd  discovered you long ago.\"    Charlotte may have eaten and studied and played and kept rules the  rest of that day and part of the next, but, if so, she has no  recollection of it. She went about like a girl in a dream, and the  matron concluded that something more than sulphur and molasses was  needed and decided to speak to the doctor about her. But she never  did, because a lady came that afternoon and told her she wanted to  adopt Charlotte.    Charlotte obeyed the summons to the matron's room in a tingle of  excitement. But when she went in, she saw only the matron and the Tall  Lady with the Black Eyes. Before Charlotte could look around for the  Pretty Lady the matron said, \"Charlotte, this lady, Miss Herbert,  wishes to adopt you. It is a splendid thing for you, and you ought to  be a very thankful little girl.\"    Charlotte's head fairly whirled. She clasped her hands and the tears  brimmed up in her eyes.    \"Oh, I like the Tall Lady,\" she gasped, \"but I _love_ the Pretty Lady  and I promised her I'd be her little girl. I can't break my promise.\"    \"What on earth is the child talking about?\" said the mystified matron.    And just then the maid showed in the Pretty Lady. Charlotte flew to  her and flung her arms about her.    \"Oh, tell them I am your little girl!\" she begged. \"Tell them I  promised you first. I don't want to hurt the Tall Lady's feelings  because I truly do like her so very much. But I want to be your little  girl.\"    The Pretty Lady had given one glance at the Tall Lady and flushed red.  The Tall Lady, on the contrary, had grown very pale. The matron felt  uncomfortable. Everybody knew that Miss Herbert and Mrs. Bond hadn't  spoken to each other for years, even if they were sisters and alone in  the world except for each other.    Mrs. Bond turned to the matron. \"I have come to ask permission to  adopt this little girl,\" she said.    \"Oh, I'm very sorry,\" stammered the matron, \"but Miss Herbert has just  asked for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24884"],[0,"Commercial Geography (#17)"],[1,"annual plant (_Linum usitalissimum_, _i.e._, most  useful fibre), native probably to the Mediterranean basin. It ranks  among the oldest known textiles. Bundles of unwrought fibre have been  found in the lake dwellings of Switzerland, and linen cloth constituted  a part of the sepulture wrappings of the ancient Egyptian dead.    Flax has a very wide range, thriving in the colder parts of Europe as  well as in tropical Asia; it does equally well in the dry summers of  California or the moist regions of the Mississippi Valley. The chief  requisite is a firm soil that contains plenty of nutrition.    After the stalks have passed maturity they are pulled up by hand;  \"rippled,\" or deprived of their seeds and leaves; \"retted,\" or moistened  in soft water until the bast separates; \"broken\" and \"scutched\" by a  machine which gets rid of the woody fibres; and finally the loosened  bast fibre is \"hetcheled\" or combed in order to separate the long, or  \"line,\" threads from the \"tow\" or refuse.    Russia produces more than one-half the world's crop, but the finest and  choicest is that known as Courtrai fibre, which is grown in Belgium.  This is thought to be due to the quality of the water in the Lys River.  A considerable amount of flax grown elsewhere in Europe is sent to this  part of Belgium to be retted. Ireland and Germany produce considerable  amounts, and a small quantity is grown in the United States.    The prepared flax is used in the manufacture of linen cloth, and the  latter is almost exclusively used for table-cloths, napkins,  shirt-bosoms, collars, cuffs, and handkerchiefs. France is noted for the  manufacture of linen lawns and cambrics, and Belfast, Ireland, for  table-cloths and napkins. Nearly the whole linen product is consumed in  the United States, Canada, and western Europe; indeed, linen is a mark  of western civilization. Great Britain handles the greater part of the  linen textiles.    =Hemp.=--The true hemp of commerce is the bast or inner bark of a plant,  _Cannabis sativa_, belonging to the nettle order. It is an annual plant  having a very wide range; it occurs in pretty nearly every country of  North America, Europe, and Asia. In Europe the chief countries producing  it for commercial uses are Russia, France, Italy, and Hungary; in the  United States it is grown in California and the central Mississippi  Valley. Russia produces the largest crop; Italy the finest quality of  fibre, the best coming from the vicinity of Bologna.    The stalks grow three feet or more in height. When cultivated for the  fibre they are pulled from the ground, stripped of their leaves and  soaked until the fibre is free. They are then \"retted,\" or beaten, and  the fibre is removed. After preparation the fibre is used mainly for the  manufacture of wrapping-twine, cordage, and a coarse canvas. Great  Britain is the chief purchaser and manufacturer.    =Manila Hemp.=--Manila hemp is the name given to a fibre obtained from the  leaves of a plant, _Musa textilis_, belonging to the banana family. The  best fibres are from six to nine feet in length, of light amber color,  and very strong. The leaves, torn into narrow strips by hand, are  afterward scraped by hand until the fibre is free of pulp. The long and  coarser fibres are made into rope; the shorter fibres are beaten and  hetcheled in the same manner as flax, until fine enough to weave into  mats, carpets, and fine cloth. The fibres that have served their  usefulness as rope are pulped and manufactured into manila paper.    Practically all the manila fibre of commerce--which is not hemp at  all--is grown in the Philippine Islands, and since peace has prevailed,  the growth and production is increasing. The crude fibre is prepared by  hand, by Filipino or by Chinese labor. The manufacture of cordage and  paper is done mainly in the United States and Great Britain. Fine  hand-made textiles are made by a few Filipino natives, but most of the  goods of this character are manufactured in France. Very fine fibre is  sometimes used as an adulterant of silk. Great Britain and the United  States are the chief purchasers.    =Sisal Hemp.=--Sisal hemp, or henequen, is a stout, stringy fibre obtained  from the thick leaves of several species of agave, to which the maguey  and century-plant belong. The cultivated species, from which most of the  commercial product is obtained, is the _Agave sisalina_, which much  resembles the ordinary century-plant.    The essential feature in the economic production of sisal hemp is  machinery for separating the fibre from the pulp of the leaf. The fibre  is whiter, cleaner, and lighter than jute; moreover, in strength it  ranks next to the best quality of manila hemp. It is used mainly in the  manufacture of grain-sacks, and the twine used on self-binding  harvesters. Nearly all the fibre of commerce is grown in the Mexican  state of Yucatan and consumed in the United States. The cultivation of  this material has made Yucatan one of the most prosperous states of  Mexico.    =Jute.=--Jute is a fibre obtained from the inner bark of a tropical plant,  _Corchorus olitorius_, belonging to the same order as the linden-tree.  The plant is an annual, growing in various moist, tropical countries,  but is extensively cultivated in India and parts of China for commercial  purposes. The fibre is prepared for manufacture in much the same manner  as hemp and flax. In India it is used mainly for the manufacture of a  coarse textile known as gunny cloth, used as bale-wrappers, and sacks  for coffee and rice. On the Pacific coast states it is used for  wheat-sacks. Calcutta is the chief centre of manufacture, but jute-sacks  are extensively manufactured by the Chinese in California and China.    =Ramie.=--This fibre, also known as China grass, is the best of two or  more species of nettles, prepared in the same manner as hemp fibre. It  is finer and stronger than jute, and will take dye-stuffs in a superior  manner. With the introduction of machinery for separating and handling  the fibre, the cultivation of the ramie-plant has spread from China to  India, Japan, and the United States. Fine textiles are now manufactured  from it, the most important being carpets, mattings, and American  \"Smyrna\" rugs. The last are generally sold as jute-rugs, and they are  nearly as durable as woollen floor-covers.    =Other Economic Fibres.=--The fibre of _cocoanut husk_ is largely employed  in the manufacture of coarse matting. A part of this is obtained from  tropical America, but it is a regular export of British India, where it  is known as _coir_.    The mid-rib of the _screw pine_ growing in the forests of tropical  America furnishes the material of which \"Panama\" hats are made. The hats  are made in various parts of Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia, and were  formerly marketed in Panama. Hats made of a score of grasses and fibres  are also sold as Panamas.    A plant (_Phormium tenax_) having leaves somewhat like those of the iris  or common flag furnishes the material of which New Zealand flax is  prepared. It is used mainly in the manufacture of cordage.    _Plaiting straw_, used in the manufacture of hats and bonnets, is grown  extensively in northern Italy and in Belgium. For this product spring  wheat is very thickly sown in a soil rich in lime. The thick sowing  produces a long, slender stalk; the lime gives it whiteness and  strength. Plaiting straw is also exported from China and Japan. British  merchants handle most of the product.    _Cuba bast_, a fibre readily bleached to whiteness, is exported to the  various establishments in which women's hats are made.    _Esparto grass_, also called _alfa_, grows in Spain and the northern  part of Africa. It was formerly much used in the manufacture of the  cheaper grades of paper, but it has been largely supplanted by wood-pulp  for this purpose. The decline of the esparto grass industry led to no  little unrest among some of the native tribes of northern Africa.      QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    What fibres were used in cloth-making in Europe before cotton was  employed?    What textiles are of necessity made of cotton?    What is a spinning jenny?--a Jacquard loom?    What are the specific differences between cotswold and merino wool?    Why were most of the cloth-making mills of the United States built at  first in the New England States?    How is the silk-making industry encouraged in the United States?    What are the chief linen manufacturing countries?      FOR STUDY AND REFERENCE    Obtain specimens of the cotton seed, boll, raw cotton (sea island,  Peruvian, and ordinary), cotton thread, calico, gingham, domestic,  canvas, and some of the fancy textiles such as organdie, lawn, etc.    Obtain specimens of the cocoons of the silk-worm, raw silk gros-grain  cloth, pongee, and tussar silk cloth.    Obtain also specimens of merino cloth, cashmere, cheviot, and other  similar goods; compare them and note the difference.    Examine the fibres of cotton, silk, and wool under a microscope and note  the difference.

In coffee, tea,  cocoa, and mate, the stimulant principle is identical with _cafein_, the  active principle of coffee; in liquors it is a powerful narcotic  _alcohol_; non-potable substances, tobacco, opium, etc., owe their  popularity also to narcotic poisons.    =Coffee.=--The coffee \"beans\" of commerce are the seeds of a tree (_Coffea  arabica_) probably native to Abyssinia, but now cultivated in various  parts of the world. It was introduced into Aden from Africa late in the  fifteenth century, and from there "]]]
