Winnie  ran forward with a cry of relief, and shouted to Beatrice the welcome  news of the arrival.    \"Don't ask me anything! Oh, I just want to go to bed; I'm done!\"  wailed Gwen, subsiding on to the nearest chair.    Beatrice took the hint, and refrained from any reproaches till she  had tucked up the prodigal in warmed blankets, with a hot bottle at  her feet, and seen her consume a basin full of steaming bread and  milk. Then she observed:    \"I suppose you know Father and half the village are out hunting for  you with lanterns? They raised the Boy Scouts and broke up the Band of  Hope meeting. They telephoned to the Police Station at North Ditton  too. I expect you're rather proud of yourself!\"    And Gwen turned her face to the wall and sobbed and coughed till she  nearly choked.    Next afternoon a very miserable-looking object, with watering eyes and  a swollen cheek sat wrapped in a shawl by the fire in Father's study.  Gwen had made her peace with Beatrice and had been forgiven, but she  was still \"eating the husks\" of her escapade in the shape of a  thoroughly bad cold and a touch of toothache. She refused to stay in  bed, yet the noise of the family sitting-room made her head throb, so  finally Father had taken pity upon her, and allowed her to bring her  troubles into his sanctum. He had said very little about the events of  the day before, but Gwen knew exactly what he must be thinking. She  mopped her eyes with her handkerchief, and tried to believe it was her  toothache that was making her cry. After a long time she said huskily,  a propos of nothing in particular:    \"Things always go so hardly with me, somehow, Dad! I don't know how it  is. I generally seem unlucky, both at school and at home. I suppose  it's partly me, but if things were easier, I'd be better. I should,  really.\"    [Illustration: \"THINGS GO SO HARDLY WITH ME SOMEHOW, DAD.\"]    Father did not reply: he was busy addressing the motto-cards that he  was sending to his parishioners for the New Year. He handed one to her  silently.    And Gwen read:         \"O do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men. Do       not pray for tasks equal to your powers; pray for powers       equal to your tasks. Then the doing of your work shall be no       miracle. But you shall be a miracle. Every day you shall       wonder at yourself, at the richness of life which has come       to you by the Grace of God.\"    --_Phillips Brooks._    Gwen sat staring hard into the fire.    \"I'll hang this up in my bedroom, Dad,\" she said presently.    \"Do; you'll find it worth thinking about,\" replied Father, as he  blotted the thirty-fourth envelope.          CHAPTER XI    A Prize Essay      Gwen went back to school feeling rather tamed and sober. The bad cold  and face-ache, subsequent on her adventure in the snow, had seriously  interfered with her plans for the holidays, and she had not  accomplished half she intended to do in the time. Dick Chambers had  been laid up in bed with an attack of rheumatism, so she had scarcely  seen anything of him, and altogether the much-longed-for month had  held its disappointments. She returned to her desk in the Fifth almost  glad to begin a fresh term, though she knew many difficulties awaited  her. First and foremost was the horrible fact that she owed a whole  sovereign to Netta Goodwin, and had absolutely no prospect of paying  it. She tried to avoid any private conversation with her chum, but the  ruse was not successful for long. Netta was a girl who was accustomed  to get her own way, and she followed Gwen round the school until she  caught her alone.    \"I say, you old slacker, what about that sov.?\" she began. \"I suppose  you got your Christmas presents all right?\"    \"Oh, yes, I got my presents!\" said Gwen, trying to pass things off  airily. \"Not quite what I expected, though.\"    \"But you can pay me back?\"    \"I'm afraid I can't just yet.\"    Netta's rather pretty face changed its expression considerably.    \"When can you, then?\" she asked sharply. \"I want to know.\"    \"Could you wait a fortnight?\"    \"It's inconvenient, but I might.\"    Netta was still scowling. \"Will you promise faithfully to bring it by  the 1st of February?\"    \"I'll do my best,\" agreed Gwen, escaping from what was to both a very  unpleasant interview.    She had mentioned a fortnight simply on the spur of the moment to put  Netta off, but she knew that the 1st of February would bring no way  out of her entanglement. It was something, however, to have even a  respite of two weeks; it gave her time to think and to lay plans. She  wondered what Netta would do if, as seemed most likely, the debt still  remained owing. She did not suppose Netta would turn informer to Miss  Roscoe, but she might very possibly mention the matter to Winnie, who  would tell Beatrice, who would promptly tell Father.    \"Only a fortnight!\" groaned Gwen, feeling like a criminal in a  condemned cell. \"Unless 'something turns up', as Mr. Micawber says in  _David Copperfield_. If I were the heroine of a novel, a forgotten  uncle in America would suddenly die, and leave me a million just at  the opportune moment. But I'm only a very unromantic, every-day kind  of person, not the forget-me-not-eyed, spun-gold-haired,  wild-rose-petal-complexioned, pearly-toothed sort of girl who gets  fortunes; I'm solid fact, not fiction. Most things are nowadays, I  suppose.\"    Certainly the Fifth Form did not offer scope for romance or sentiment.  Its daily doings were most prosaic, a round in which Latin,  mathematics, and chemistry were chiefly to the fore, and the only  appeal to the imagination was the weekly lecture on English literature  from the Principal. Gwen liked these; Miss Roscoe had the knack of  making historical dry bones live, and encouraged the girls to read for  themselves. All her lessons were interesting, but in this she was  inspiring. She was accustomed to give themes for fortnightly  exercises, and at the first lecture of this new term she announced as  a special subject: \"An Essay on any one of the Great Writers of the  Victorian Era\", promising a volume of Browning's poems as a prize.    \"I had intended to offer it for Christmas,\" she said, \"but I thought  you were too busy preparing for examinations to be able to give time  to such an essay. I hope you'll do justice to the subject now.\"    It was a large order, thought Gwen, when already their homework had  about reached its outside limit. Miss Roscoe was quite unconscionable  in her demands on their time and brains. She fixed the standard of the  Form so high that only the very bright girls could possibly keep up to  it. Many slacked off entirely, but Gwen could not, dared not slack.  She knew Miss Roscoe was watching her work, and that very much  depended upon her reports for the next year or two. Father had thrown  out a few hints that had stirred her ambition and raised wild hopes  for the future. She was aware that there were several good  scholarships from Rodenhurst, and visions of College began to dawn on  her horizon.    \"'Gwen Gascoyne, B.A.', sounds no end. It would be worth the grind. I  mayn't be the beauty of the family, but I believe I've got the best  share of the brains. Beatrice would be proud of me if I took my  degree. I must make something of this essay if I 'burn the midnight'.  Miss Roscoe will expect me to turn up trumps. I'll toil like a navvy!\"    So Gwen decided, and stuck to her resolution. She had an undoubted  capacity for work, a power of application and of steady plodding that  were of immense service, as well as more brilliant gifts. She attacked  the question at once. The Victorian writers offered a fairly wide  choice of subject. She hesitated at first between George Eliot and  Dickens, and finally selected Thomas Carlyle. Something about the  rugged old prophet attracted her, and she thought he would be a  congenial theme for her pen. She spent every spare moment in reading  his biographies or his works, till she felt she had him at her  fingers' ends. Then, with a mass of notes as a foundation, she began  her essay.    Most young writers undergo the same first agonies of composition: the  vainly sought simile, the sentence that will not turn nicely, the  tiresome word that crops up too often, yet for which there seems no  adequate substitute; the sudden lack of ideas, or the non-ability to  clothe those one has in suitable language.    Gwen wrote and burnt, and wrote and burnt again, till at last she  managed something, not at all up to the ideal of her imagination, but  the best her limited literary experience could produce. She refused to  show it to anybody at home, and bore it off to school to read over and  correct during the dinner hour. She was sitting at her desk, busy  altering sentences and erasing words, when Netta came into the room.    \"Hello, you old solitary hermit!\" she exclaimed. \"What are you doing  here, with your nose buried in an exercise book? There's no getting at  you nowadays. You'll grow old before your time, Gwen, my child! Come  out this instant, and play basket-ball.\"    \"Can't, so that's flat,\" responded Gwen. \"Netta, if you love me, if  you've any humanity in you, leave me alone. Basket-ball's off till  I've finished this.\"    \"Well, you've got to tell me what you're doing, at any rate. Let me  look! No, Miss Modesty, you're not going to hide your light under a  bushel. I insist! Oho! What have we got here now?\"    Netta dragged the book from Gwen's reluctant hands, and sitting on a  neighbouring desk, began hastily to skim through the essay, giving  grunts of approval as she read.    \"First rate! I say, this is immense! Gwen, my hearty, I didn't think  you'd got it in you!\"    \"Will it do?\" demanded Gwen anxiously. She had sat on metaphorical  pins"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#17)"],[1,"prebendaries, four singing boys, and six bedesmen. It is interesting as  being among the latest, if not indeed the last, of the Scottish  pre-Reformation churches. It belongs to the Late Pointed period, is  cruciform in plan, consists of chancel with apsidal east end, transept,  and nave, with square tower and north-east belfry turret over the  crossing. There are no aisles. Formerly a chapter-house existed on the  north side of the chancel, but it has been removed. The ancient roof was  of oak, and the timbers in the chancel were gilt and emblazoned.    _St. Bride's Collegiate Church, Bothwell_, was founded by Archibald \"the  Grim,\" Earl of Douglas, in 1398, for a provost and eight prebendaries.  He endowed and added a choir to the existing parish church. The present  church is a fine Gothic building, erected in 1833, with a massive square  tower to the height of 120 feet. East of this tower is the choir of the  old collegiate church, of the Middle Pointed or Decorated period; it is  a simple oblong chamber with a sacristy on the north side. The church,  externally divided by buttresses, has four bays with a series of pointed  windows in the south wall, and three windows in the north wall. The arch  of the entrance doorway in the south wall is elliptic in form. The roof  of the church is covered with overlapping stone slabs, which rest on a  pointed barrel vault--one of the earliest examples met with. In the  sacristy there are a piscina and a locker, and in the south wall of the  choir the remains of a triple beautifully carved sedilia and a piscina.  The sacristy is roofed with overlapping stone flags supported on a  vault. Monuments to the two Archibald Douglases, Earls of Forfar, are in  the church. In this church David, the hapless Earl of Rothesay, wedded  Marjory, the founder's daughter, in 1400, and one of its provosts was  Thomas Barry, who celebrated the victory of Otterburn in Latin verse. It  has been recently restored and made worthy of its great past.    _New Aberdeen._--The Parish Church of St. Nicholas, said to be the  largest mediaeval parish church in Scotland, was made collegiate about  1456 by Bishop Ingeram de Lyndesay (1441-1459), and is said to have  possessed, besides the vicar, \"chaplains to the number of thirty.\"[230]  Its clergy were named the \"College of the Chaplains\" of St. Nicholas,  and after, as before, the institution of this new order the church  remained the parish church. Only two portions of the ancient building  now remain--the transepts and the crypt at the east end below the  choir.[231] The present nave was rebuilt about 1750; the choir was taken  down in 1835 and rebuilt in the most tasteless fashion; the walls of the  crypt and transepts were all refaced except the north front of the  transept, which was altered considerably in the seventeenth century; the  central tower was burned in 1874, and the existing central spire was  thereafter erected. A carillon of thirty-seven bells has been placed  within it.    After the Reformation the rood-screen gave place to a wall, and St.  Nicholas was divided into two churches, the West consisting of the  former nave, the East of the choir, and the Romanesque transept between  (known as Drum's and Collison's aisles) serving as vestibule. For the  early architecture attention must be confined to the interior of the  transept and crypt. The transepts are of the transitional style of the  end of the twelfth century; the piers which carry the central tower are  of the usual transitional type, having graceful capitals and square  abaci supporting round arches; on each side of the north transept there  are two original clerestory windows, and one of them has angle shafts,  with carved caps and mouldings. The present large north window has  remains of its original features, but its tracery is of late work. There  is a transition attached shaft with carved cap and square abacus in the  low pointed recess. There is only a shaft on one side of the recess, and  the pointed arch of this recess, as well as the tomb alongside, below  the large window, are of later work.[232] On the west side of the north  wall there has been a round arched doorway, and traces of it are yet  visible. The crypt is at the east end of the choir, but is on a lower  level, and was approached by two stairs, one from the north and another  from the south aisle of the choir. Only their round arched openings  remain as recesses in the walls of the crypt. The present stairs are  modern. The crypt consists of one central and two side aisles, with an  eastern apse; it is pronounced to be a very picturesque and interesting  structure, and it fortunately escaped being rebuilt, like the rest of  the church. It has a groined roof, and the three compartments in the  length are separated by pointed arches that spring from moulded caps on  octagonal responds. \"The opening into the apse has a stunted round arch,  and is a prominent example of the love of the Scottish builders for  this form of arch all through the Gothic period.\"[233] Each compartment  of the apse has a central boss, and there is a considerable amount of  carved woodwork in the crypt--some of the fifteenth or sixteenth  century, and some later. The choir that was recently taken down  superseded an older one, and it is probably to this former choir that  references are contained in the _Council Register_ for about a century  from 1442.    _Old Aberdeen, King's College._--Of Bishop Elphinstone of Aberdeen  (1488-1514) it is said: \"With no private fortune, and without  dilapidating his benefice, he provided for the buildings requisite for  his University and Collegiate Church, and for the suitable maintenance  of its forty-two members; and the Cathedral Choir, the King's College,  and the old gray bridge spanning the valley of the Dee are monuments to  his memory that command the respect of those who have no sympathy with  his Breviary, rich in legends of Scottish Saints, and who would scarcely  approve of his reformed Gregorian chant.\"[234] The college was dedicated  to the Holy Trinity and the Virgin Mary, and being placed under the  immediate protection of the King, came to be known as King's College.  King James IV. and Bishop Elphinstone endowed it with large revenues. It  was a faithful copy of the University of Paris. The Collegiate Church of  St. Mary, on the north side of the quadrangle, was consecrated by  Edward, Bishop of Orkney, and had eight priests or vicars choral  belonging to it, and six singing boys.[235] It was begun in 1500 and  finished in 1506, and it was said that all its stones and beams proclaim  Bishop Elphinstone their founder, who also presented the chapter with  many valuable vestments, vessels, etc. The chapel is a long, narrow  building, with a three-sided apsidal east end. It is divided into six  bays by projecting buttresses, and has a large window filled with  mullions and tracery in each bay on the north side, except the second  one from the west, which contains a doorway. Similar large windows are  continued in the apse, and there is also one in the east bay of the  south side. Over the west doorway there is a large west window of four  lights, with solid built mullions and loop tracery enclosed within a  round arch.[236] The tower at the south-west corner has massive corner  buttresses. It is finished with one of the few crown steeples remaining  in Scotland, forming,        \"with that of St. Giles, Edinburgh, and the Tolbooth, Glasgow, the      only three surviving of those which we could at one time boast. The      general style of the structure is very similar to that of St. Giles,      but in this case there are only four arches thrown from the angles      of the tower to the central lantern, while in the case of St. Giles      there are eight, which produce a fuller and richer effect.... The      part blown down (by a violent storm in 1633) was probably only the      lantern on the top of the four arches, the details of this part      having a decidedly Renaissance character, and being different from      the other parts of the tower. Doubtless the arches themselves would      suffer in the crash, and would require repairing and rebuilding in      part, which was evidently done, as the date 1634 is carved on the      soffit of the crossing. This difference of detail is interesting as      showing how persistently these old designers wrought in the style of      their time. Although it is evident that the present lantern is not      quite the same as the original one, it must be admitted to be an      extremely happy and picturesque composition.\"[237]    The chapel suffered both externally and internally in the course of the  centuries, but, thanks to the enlightened liberality of Aberdeen  citizens and alumni, it has been recently restored under the direction  of Dr. Rowand Anderson. In 1823 the choir end was fitted up for worship  on the Sundays, and the nave was occupied by the library, which was not  removed and located in a building of its own until 1873. The choir  screen was then shifted westward from its original position, where its  west front formerly bisected the chapel.        \"In the ideas of Bishop Elphinstone,\" said the late Principal Sir      William Geddes, \"and his age, the choir-screen was intended to      partition off the sacred _clerus_ from the _non-clerus_ or laity,      and, by the predominance of anthems and songs in the choir-service,      to image forth the conception of the blest society in heaven, where      there is only praise; but the 'Collegium' which he constituted has,      through historical causes, given way to the wider society of the      'Congregation,' in which preaching is as prominent as praise, and      hence came the removal of the choir-screen westward, so as to      accommodate a larger audience than the Collegium proper. This      removal the Restoration Committee of 1891 acquiesced in and      accepted, but the change"]]]
