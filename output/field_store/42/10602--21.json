Those guests who assembled first passed their time in smoking the  medicine pipe until the others should arrive; for so long as a single  invited guest is absent the feast cannot begin.  Dignified silence was  maintained while the pipe thus circulated from hand to hand.  When the  last guest arrived they began.    The men were seated in two rows, face to face.  Feasts of this kind  usually consist of but one species of food, and on the present occasion  it was an enormous cauldron full of maize which had to be devoured.  About fifty sat down to eat a quantity of what may be termed thick  porridge, that would have been ample allowance for a hundred ordinary  men.  Before commencing, San-it-sa-rish desired an aged medicine-man to  make an oration, which he did fluently and poetically.  Its subject was  the praise of the giver of the feast.  At the end of each period there  was a general \"Hou! hou!\" of assent--equivalent to the hear! hear! of  civilised men.    Other orators then followed, all of whom spoke with great ease and  fluency, and some in the most impassioned strains, working themselves  and their audience up to the highest pitch of excitement, now shouting  with frenzied violence till their eyes glared from their sockets, and  the veins of their foreheads swelled almost to bursting as they spoke of  war and chase--anon breaking into soft modulated and pleasing tones,  while they dilated upon the pleasures of peace and hospitality.    After these had finished, a number of wooden bowls full of maize  porridge were put down between the guests--one bowl to each couple  facing each other.  But before commencing, a portion was laid aside and  dedicated to their gods, with various mysterious ceremonies; for here,  as in other places where the gospel is not known, the poor savages  fancied that they could propitiate God with sacrifices.  They had never  heard of the \"sacrifice of a broken spirit and a contrite heart.\"  This  offering being made, the feast began in earnest.  Not only was it a rule  in this feast that every mouthful should be swallowed by each guest,  however unwilling and unable he should be to do so, but he who could  dispose of it with greatest speed was deemed the greatest man--at least  on that occasion--while the last to conclude his supper was looked upon  with some degree of contempt!    It seems strange that such a custom should ever have arisen, and one is  not a little puzzled in endeavouring to guess at the origin of it.  There is one fact that occurs to us as the probable cause.  The Indian  is, as we have before hinted, frequently reduced to a state bordering on  starvation, and in a day after he may be burdened with superabundance of  food.  He oftentimes, therefore, eats as much as he can stuff into his  body when he is blessed with plenty, so as to be the better able to  withstand the attacks of hunger that may possibly be in store for him.  The amount that an Indian will thus eat at a single meal is incredible.  He seems to have the power of distending himself for the reception of a  quantity that would kill a civilised man.  Children, in particular,  become like tightly inflated little balloons after a feast, and as they  wear no clothing, the extraordinary rotundity is very obvious, not to  say ridiculous.  We conclude, therefore, that unusual powers of  gormandising, being useful, come at last to be cultivated as  praiseworthy.    By good fortune Dick and Joe Blunt happened to have such enormous  gluttons as _vis-a-vis_, that the portions of their respective bowls  which they could not devour were gobbled up for them.  By good capacity  and digestion, with no small amount of effort, Henri managed to dispose  of his own share; but he was last of being done, and fell in the  savages' esteem greatly.  The way in which that sticky compost of boiled  maize went down was absolutely amazing.  The man opposite Dick, in  particular, was a human boa-constrictor.  He well-nigh suffocated Dick  with suppressed laughter.  He was a great raw-boned savage, with a  throat of indiarubber, and went quickly and quietly on swallowing mass  after mass, with the solemn gravity of an owl.  It mattered not a straw  to him that Dick took comparatively small mouthfuls, and nearly choked  on them too for want of liquid to wash them down.  Had Dick eaten none  at all he would have uncomplainingly disposed of the whole.  Jack the  Giant-Killer's feats were nothing to his, and when at last the bowl was  empty, he stopped short like a machine from which the steam had been  suddenly cut off, and laid down his buffalo horn spoon _without_ a sigh.    Dick sighed, though, with relief and gratitude when his bowl was empty.    \"I hope I may never have to do it again,\" said Joe that night as they  wended their way back to the chief's tent after supper.  \"I wouldn't be  fit for anything for a week arter it.\"    Dick could only laugh, for any allusion to the feast instantly brought  back that owl-like gourmand to whom he was so deeply indebted.    Henri groaned.  \"Oh! mes boy, I am speechless!  I am ready for bust!  Oui,--hah!  I veesh it vas to-morrow.\"    Many a time that night did Henri \"veesh it vas to-morrow,\" as he lay  helpless on his back, looking up through the roof of the chief's tent at  the stars, and listening enviously to the plethoric snoring of Joe  Blunt.    He was entertained, however, during those waking hours with a serenade  such as few civilised ears ever listen to.  This was nothing else than a  vocal concert performed by all the dogs of the village, and as they  amounted to nearly two thousand, the orchestra was a pretty full one.    These wretches howled as if they had all gone mad.  Yet there was  \"method in their madness,\" for they congregated in a crowd before  beginning, and sat down on their haunches.  Then one, which seemed to be  the conductor, raised his snout to the sky, and uttered a long, low,  melancholy wail.  The others took it up by twos and threes, until the  whole pack had their noses pointing to the stars, and their throats  distended to the uttermost, while a prolonged yell filled the air.  Then  it sank gradually, one or two (bad performers probably) making a yelping  attempt to get it up again at the wrong time.  Again the conductor  raised his nose, and out it came--full swing.  There was no vociferous  barking.  It was simple wolfish howling increased in fervour to an  electric yell, with slight barks running continuously through it like an  obbligato accompaniment.    When Crusoe first heard the unwonted sound he sprang to his feet,  bristled up like a hyena, showed all his teeth, and bounded out of the  tent blazing with indignation and astonishment.  When he found out what  it was he returned quite sleek, and with a look of profound contempt on  his countenance as he resumed his place by his master's side and went to  sleep.        CHAPTER TEN.    PERPLEXITIES--OUR HUNTERS PLAN THEIR ESCAPE--UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION--  THE TABLES TURNED--CRUSOE MOUNTS GUARD--THE ESCAPE.    Dick Varley sat before the fire ruminating.  We do not mean to assert  that Dick had been previously eating grass.  By no means.  For several  days past he had been mentally subsisting on the remarkable things that  he heard and saw in the Pawnee village, and wondering how he was to get  away without being scalped; he was now chewing the cud of this  intellectual fare.  We therefore repeat emphatically--in case any reader  should have presumed to contradict us--that Dick Varley sat before the  fire _ruminating_!    Joe Blunt likewise sat by the fire along with him, ruminating too, and  smoking besides.  Henri also sat there smoking, and looking a little the  worse of his late supper.    \"I don't like the look o' things,\" said Joe, blowing a whiff of smoke  slowly from his lips, and watching it as it ascended into the still air.  \"That blackguard Mahtawa is determined not to let us off till he gits  all our goods, an' if he gits them, he may as well take our scalps too,  for we would come poor speed in the prairies without guns, horses, or  goods.\"    Dick looked at his friend with an expression of concern.  \"What's to be  done?\" said he.    \"Ve must escape,\" answered Henri; but his tone was not a hopeful one,  for he knew the danger of their position better than Dick.    \"Ay, we must escape; at least we must try,\" said Joe; \"but I'll make one  more effort to smooth over San-it-sa-rish, an' git him to snub that  villain Mahtawa.\"    Just as he spoke the villain in question entered the tent with a bold,  haughty air, and sat down before the fire in sullen silence.  For some  minutes no one spoke, and Henri, who happened at the time to be  examining the locks of Dick's rifle, continued to inspect them with an  appearance of careless indifference that he was far from feeling.    Now, this rifle of Dick's had become a source of unceasing wonder to the  Indians,--wonder which was greatly increased by the fact that no one  could discharge it but himself.  Dick had, during his short stay at the  Pawnee village, amused himself and the savages by exhibiting his  marvellous powers with the \"silver rifle.\"  Since it had been won by him  at the memorable match in the Mustang Valley, it had scarce ever been  out of his hand, so that he had become decidedly the best shot in the  settlement, could \"bark\" squirrels (that is, hit the bark of the branch  on which a squirrel happened to be standing, and so kill it by the  concussion alone), and could \"drive the nail\" every shot.  The silver  rifle, as we have said, became \"great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#17)"],[1,"pause, and I confess that at that moment a feeling of  superstitious dread chilled the blood in my veins.  Before we could  discover the cause of this strange effect, several large black objects  passed through the air near our heads with a peculiar muffled noise.  Next instant the three torches were extinguished.    Unable to command himself any longer, the negro uttered a cry of terror  and turned to fly; but Jack, whose wits seemed always prepared for any  emergency, had foreseen the probability of this, and springing quickly  after him, threw his arms round his neck and effectually prevented his  running away.    The noise caused by the scuffle seemed to arouse the fury of all the  evil spirits of the place, for a perfect hurricane of whirring sounds  raged around us for a few seconds.    \"It's only bats,\" cried Jack.--\"Look alive, Peterkin; another light.\"    In a few seconds the torches were rekindled, and we advanced into the  cavern; and Mak, after recovering from his fright and learning the cause  thereof, became much bolder.  The cave was about a hundred yards deep by  about fifty wide; but we could not ascertain its height, for the light  of our torches failed to penetrate the deep gloom overhead.  It was  divided into two natural chambers, the outer being large, the inner  small--a mere recess, in fact.  In this latter we planted our torches,  and proceeded with our hasty preparations.  Peterkin was ready first.  We endeavoured to make ourselves as like to the natives in all respects  as possible; and when I looked at my companions, I was obliged to  confess that, except in the full blaze of the torch-light, I could not  discern any point of difference between them and our guide.    \"Now then, Jack,\" said Peterkin, \"as you're not quite ready and I am, I  shall employ myself in preparing a little plan of my own which I intend  to put in force if the savages dare to venture into the cavern after  us.\"    \"Very good; but see that you finish it in less than five minutes, for  I'll be ready in that time.\"    Peterkin immediately poured out a large quantity of powder on a flat  rock, and mingling with it a little water from a pool near by, converted  it into a semi-moist ball.  This he divided into three parts, and  forming each part into the shape of a tall cone, laid the whole  carefully aside.    \"There!\" said he, \"lie you there until you are wanted.\"    At this moment, while Jack and I were bending down fastening the latchet  of our shoes, our ears were saluted with one of the most appalling yells  I ever listened to.  Makarooroo fell flat to the earth in his fright,  and my own heart chilled with horror, while Jack sprang up and  instinctively grasped the handle of his hunting-knife.    \"Very good,\" said Peterkin, as he stood laughing at us quietly, and we  immediately perceived that it was he who uttered the cry.    \"Why, what mean you?\" said Jack, almost angrily.  \"Surely this is no  time for foolish jesting.\"    \"I am anything but jesting, Jack.  I'm only rehearsing another part of  my plan.\"    \"But you ought to give us warning when you are about to do such  startling things,\" said I remonstratively.    \"Nay, that would not have done at all, because then I should not have  known what effect my cry is likely to produce on unexpectant ears.\"    \"Well, now, are you all ready?\" inquired Jack.  \"Then let us go.\"    Issuing forth armed only with our double-barrelled guns and heavy  hunting-knives, we hastened towards the native village.  When within a  hundred yards of the edge of the wood that skirted it we stopped to pull  off our shoes, for it was necessary that we should have nothing about  our persons to tell who we were should any one chance to see us as we  ran.  We also left our rifles beside the shoes at a spot where we could  find them in an instant in passing, and then slowly approached the  outskirts of the village.    Presently we heard the hum of distant voices shouting, and the fear that  the scene of bloodshed had already begun induced us to quicken our pace  to a smart run.  I never saw a man so deeply affected as was our poor  guide, and when I looked at him I felt extremely anxious lest his state  of mind should unfit him for acting with needful caution.    We gained the first cottages--they were empty.  The village having been  recently built, no stockade had yet been thrown round it, so our  progress was unimpeded.    \"We must be very cautious now,\" observed Jack in a whisper.--\"Restrain  yourself, Makarooroo; Okandaga's life depends on our coolness.\"    On reaching the back of the next hut, which was also empty.  Jack  motioned to us to halt, and coming close to us looked earnestly in each  of our faces without saying a word.  I supposed that, like a wise  general, he was reviewing his troops--seeing whether the men he was  about to lead into battle were fit for their work.    \"Now,\" said he rapidly, \"it's evident from the shouting that's going on  that they won't waste much time with their palaver.  The hut in which  she is confined is not fifty yards off; I took care to ascertain its  position before leaving this morning.  What we have to do is simple.  Spring on the guards and knock them down with our fists or the hilts of  our hunting-knives, or with bits of stick, as suits us best.  But  _mind_\"--here he looked pointedly at our guide--\"no shedding of blood if  it can be avoided.  These men are not our enemies.  Follow me in single  file; when I halt, come up into line; let each single out the man  nearest to him, and when I hold up my hand spring like wild-cats.  If  there happen to be five or six guards instead of four, leave the  additional ones to me.\"  We merely nodded assent, and in another minute  were close upon the prison.  Peterkin, Mak, and I had provided us with  short heavy bludgeons on our way.  These we held in our right hands; our  left hands we kept free either to grasp our opponents with, or to draw  our knives if necessary.  Jack carried his long knife--it might almost  have been termed a short sword--in his left hand, and from the manner in  which he clinched his right I saw that he meant to make use of it as his  principal weapon.    On gaining the back of the house we heard voices within, but could see  nothing, so we moved softly round to the front, keeping, however, well  behind the screen of bushes.  Here Jack halted, and we ranged up  alongside of him and peeped through the bushes.  The hut was quite open  in front and the interior was brightly lighted by a strong fire, round  which the four guards--stout fellows all of them--were seated with their  spears beside them on the ground.  They were conversing in an excited  tone, and taking no notice of Okandaga, who sat behind them, partially  in the shade, with her face buried in her hands.  She was not tied in  any way, as the guards knew well enough that she could not hope to  escape them by mere running way.    One rapid glance showed us all this, and enabled us to select our men.  Then Jack gave the signal, and without an instant's hesitation we darted  upon them.  I know not in what manner my comrades acted their part.  From the moment I set eyes on the negro nearest to me, my blood began to  boil.  Somehow or other I saw Jack give the signal without taking my  eyes off my intended victim, then I sprang forward, and he had barely  time to look up in alarm when I struck him with all my force on the  right temple.  He fell without a groan.  I looked round instantly, and  there lay the other three, with my companions standing over them.  Our  plan had been so well concerted and so promptly executed that the four  men fell almost at the same instant, and without a cry.    Poor Okandaga leaped up and uttered a faint scream of alarm, but  Makarooroo's voice instantly reassured her, and with an exclamation of  joy she sprang into his arms.  There was no time for delay.  While the  scene I have described was being enacted the shouts in the centre of the  village had been increasing, and we guessed that in a few minutes more  the bloodthirsty executioners would come for their helpless victim.  We  therefore left the hut at once, and ran as fast as we could towards the  place where our guns and shoes had been left.  Our guide seized Okandaga  by the wrist and dragged her along; but indeed she was so nimble that at  first she required no assistance.  In a short time, however, we were  obliged to slacken our pace in order to enable her to keep up.  We  reached the guns in safety; but while we were in the act of lifting them  a burst of wild cries, that grew louder and fiercer as they approached,  told that the natives were rushing tumultuously towards the prison.    \"Now, lads,\" said Jack, \"we must put on full speed.--Mak, take her right  hand.--Here, Okandaga, your left.\"    At that instant there was a shout in the village, so loud that we knew  the escape was discovered.  An indescribable hubbub ensued, but we soon  lost it in the crackling of the underwood as we burst through it in our  headlong flight towards the cave.  The poor girl, feeling that her life  depended on it, exerted herself to the utmost, and with the aid of Jack  and her lover kept well up.    \"She'll never hold out to the end,\" said Peterkin, glancing over his  shoulder as he ran.    The cries of the savages filled the woods in all directions, showing  that they had instantly scattered themselves in the pursuit, in order to  increase their chances of intercepting us.  We had already traversed the  greater part of the wood that lay between the village and the haunted  cavern, when two negroes, who must have taken a shorter route, descried  us.  They instantly uttered a yell of triumph and followed us at full  speed, while from the cries closing in upon us we could tell that the  others had heard and understood the shout.  Just then Okandaga's  strength began to fail, and her extreme terror, as the pursuers gained  on us, tended"]]]
