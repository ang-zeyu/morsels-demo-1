[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22107"],[0,"Wood-Carving: Design and Workmanship (#17)"],[1," a cloak of humorous exaggeration; a sort of  Viking horse-play--it is, in fact, a language which expresses the mixed  feelings of sportive contempt and real fear in about equal proportions.  When these feelings are not behind the expression, it becomes a language  which is in itself only contemptible.    [Illustration: FIG. 63.]    If, carried away by fancy, you must find vent for its impulses, and  carve images of unearthly beings, at least make them cheerful looking;  one can imagine such demons and goblins as being rather nice fellows  than otherwise. A grim jest that fails is generally a foolish one--at  least its perpetrator neither deserves nor receives sympathy for his  discomfiture. Now, I shall show you one or two examples which may make  this matter a little clearer to you, if you are at all inclined to argue  the position. I think, at any rate, they will prove that the expression  of humor does not always depend upon exaggeration, and may exist in a  work which is, one may say, almost copied from nature. Fig. 63 is an  example to this effect. The little jester just emerging from a flower,  one of the side-pieces to a Miserere seat carving, is undoubtedly a true  portrait, carved without the slightest attempt at exaggeration. The  quiet humor which it evinces required only sympathy to perceive and  skill to portray on the part of its carver. He had nothing to invent in  the common acceptation of the word. The carving of the mendicant, which  comes on the other side, is equally vivid in its truth to nature. It is  so lifelike that we do not notice the humorous enjoyment of the artist  in depicting the whining lips and closed eyes of the professional  beggar. Observe the good manners of it all--the natural refinement of  the artist who leaves his characters to make all the fun, without  intrusion from himself other than to give the aid of his skill in  representation. Now, subjects of this class will, in all probability,  present themselves until the end of the world; but artists like this  Gothic one are not so likely to be common. Great technical skill, a  large fund of vitality, and many other controlling qualities are  necessary to the production of such an artist; but he gives a clue to  the right action, which we may with safety accept, even if we can not  hope to equal his performance.    [Illustration: FIG. 64.]    [Illustration: FIG. 65.]    The center-piece, Fig. 64, tells a little story of Samson. It is  noticeable in these medieval picture subjects, how, when a story has to  be told, the details are treated in a broad and distinct fashion, as if  the story could take care of itself, and only required to be stated  clearly as to facts. The detached ornamental parts, on the contrary,  receive a degree of careful attention not given to the picture,  seemingly with the object of making their loneliness attractive.    The broad-humor characteristic of the companion picture of medieval  life, in the little domestic scene, Fig. 65, is equally free from forced  exaggeration or intentional misproportion. Scale and anatomy, to be  sure, have had little consideration from the carver, but we readily  forgive the inaccuracies in this respect, on account of his quick wit in  devising means to an end.    Before we leave this subject, look at Plate II, in which you will see a  curious use of misproportion--intentional, too, in this case--and used  for quite other than humorous purposes. This is a little ornamental  figure from the tomb of Henry IV, in Canterbury Cathedral. You will see  that the body is out of all proportion; too small for the head which  surmounts it, or too big for the feet upon which it stands. Now, what  could have induced the carver to treat a dainty little lady thus? It  certainly was not that he considered it an improvement upon nature, nor  was it a joke on his part. It could only be done for some practical  reason such as this: that the little figure does part duty as a bracket,  hence, more appearance of solidity is required at the top, and less at  the foot, than true proportions would admit. It is all done so  unostentatiously that one might look for hours at the figure without  noticing the license. Not that I should advise you to imitate this  naive way out of a difficulty. The childlike simplicity of its treatment  succeeds where conscious effort would only end in affectation.    [Illustration: FIG. 66.]    [Illustration: FIG. 67.]    In Fig. 66 you will see another little figure doing duty in connection  with a stall division in the Lady Chapel at Winchester Cathedral. Its  smooth roundness of form is very appropriate to the position it  occupies; while its polished surface bears ample testimony that it has  given no offense to the touch of the many hands which have rested upon  it.    Fig. 67 shows another example of the same sort, but perched on a lower  part of the division. This one is from the cathedral at Berne, each  division of the stalls having a different figure, of which this is a  type.          CHAPTER XX    STUDIES FROM NATURE--BIRDS AND BEASTS           The Introduction of Animal Forms--Rude Vitality Better than Dull       \"Natural History\"--\"Action\"--Difficulties of the Study for       Town-Bred Students--The Aid of Books and Photographs--Outline       Drawing and Suggestion of Main Masses--Sketch-Book Studies,       Sections, and Notes--Swiss Animal Carving--The Clay Model: its Use       and Abuse.      Nothing enlivens or gives more variety of interest to wood-carving than  the introduction of animal forms. They make agreeable halting-places on  which the eye may rest with pleasure. They are, in general, both  beautiful in their shapes and associated with ideas which appeal  strongly to the imagination, thus affording in masses of abstract  ornament the pleasantest kind of relief by adding to it points of  definite lineament and meaning.    To carve animals as they ought to be carved, one must have something  more than a passing interest in their forms; there must be included also  an understanding of their natures, and some acquaintance with their  habits. A cattle-drover is likely to know the salient points of a  bullock, a horse-breeder all those connected with a horse, and so on. We  students, however, not having the advantage of such accurate and  personal knowledge, must make shift in the best way we can to discover  and note the points so familiar to trained eyes. To see animals in this  way, and, with knowledge of their forms and habits, treat their  sculptured images according to the laws of our craft, is no light task.  If choice were to be made between a rude manner of carving--but which  familiarity with the subject invested with lively recognition of  character--and a more cultured and elaborate, but lifeless study in  natural history, there should be no hesitation in making choice of the  former method, because animal forms, without some indication of  vitality, are the dullest of all dull ornaments.    It is quite impossible to describe in words the kind of \"action\" which  is most appropriate to sculpture, it being much more a question of  treatment, and the guiding spirit of the moment, than a subject which  can be formulated. As a broad and general principle which may be taken  for guidance, you will always find yourself on surer ground in the  attempt to indicate the _capacity_ for energy and the suggestion of  _movement_, than you will if your aim is the extremity of action in any  direction. You may, with some justice, point to the illustration given  in Fig. 65, and which appears to contradict this statement, as being an  example in which violent action is the key-note. You must notice,  however, that the two figures, although struggling, are for the moment  still, or may be supposed so. There is enough suggestion of this  pause to excuse the attitudes and save the composition from  restlessness--even the raised hands may be supposed to remain in the  same position for a second or two. This imaginary pause, however  infinitesimal, is essential to the dignity of the sculptor's art, as  nothing is more irritating to the mind than being forced to recognize  the contradiction between a motionless image and its suggestion of  restless action. It is necessary to observe the same rule in the  expression of actual repose, as some clue must be given, some completed  action be suggested, in order to distinguish dormant energy from  downright inertia. I should like to impress upon you the importance of  making a special study of the characteristic movements of animals. You  will in time become so far familiar with them that certain standards of  comparison and contrast will be established in your mind as aids to  memory. Thus you will be all the better able to carve with significance  the measured and stately action of a horse, if you have in your mind's  eye at the same time a picture of the more cumbrous and slower movements  of a cow; and you will be helped in the same way when you are carving a  dog, by remembering that the movements of a cat afford a striking  contrast, in being stealthy where the other is nervous and quick.    For the unfortunate town-bred student or artist, who has had few  opportunities to study birds and beasts familiar to the country  schoolboy, there is no other way but to make the best of stuffed birds,  photographs, etc. Much may be done with these aids if a little personal  acquaintance with their habits and associations is added like salt, to  keep the second-hand knowledge sweet and wholesome.    In the absence of opportunity for study from the life, no pictures of  animals can compare in their usefulness to the carver with those by  Bewick. They are so completely developed in essential details, so full  of character and expressive of life, that even when personal  acquaintance has been made with their various qualities, a glance at one  of his engravings of birds or beasts conveys new meaning, either of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22114"],[0,"A Plain Cookery Book for the Working Classes (#17)"],[1,"Polson Pudding, 31

Thomas Harrild, Printer, Shoe Lane, Fleet Street, London.          [Illustration]    TO THE FACULTY.    J. & J. COLMAN'S    GENUINE MUSTARD.    The Lancet, by its resumed inquiries upon the subject of adulterations,  has again called attention of the Public to a variety of articles of  daily use.    To Mustard great prominence has been given, from the fact that  thirty-three samples were examined. The Report states that _four_ only  were found to be _genuine_: of which, _two_ samples were of the  manufacture of J. and J. COLMAN, being respectively \"Colman's Genuine  London Mustard, Warranted Pure,\" and \"Colman's Brown Mustard, Warranted  Pure.\"    We also learn that manufactured Mustard extends from the _pure_ and  _genuine_ to the _injurious combination_ exposed in _The Lancet_ (see  27th Sample examined); to which disclosure the attention of Medical Men  is invited (whether practising privately or in Hospitals and  Infirmaries) when prescribing Mustard as a remedial agent. The fact is  also equally important to the Vendor and his customer, the Public.    And further, as to _quality_--_The Lancet_, in substance, reports that  _genuine Mustard_ will be as _varied_ in strength, pungency, and  flavour, as are the known differences between the finest and most  inferior qualities of seed; it results, then, that _genuine_ does not  necessarily imply high quality.    J. and J. COLMAN submit, that in their _Pure Mustards_ nothing that  known skill and improved machinery can obtain from finest seed remains  unsecured, and, whether for prompt and specific _medical_ effects, or as  a table condiment, these Mustards are equally valuable.    J. and J. COLMAN offer to the Public not only \"Genuine\" and \"Pure\"  Mustard in the highest perfection, but also their other varieties of  Mustard Condiments, known as \"Double Superfine,\" \"Superfine,\" \"Fine,\"  etc., in which delicacy, flavour, and strength will be found in  agreeable combination. These Mustards may be obtained of any Grocer,  Chemist, or Italian Warehouseman in the kingdom; and when sold in tins  or packets, J. and J. COLMAN's _trade mark_, the \"Bull's Head,\" is a  guarantee upon which the Public may rely.    J. & J. COLMAN, 26, Cannon Street, London, E.C.                           CONSUMPTION IN ALL ITS STAGES,            Coughs, Whooping Cough, Asthma, Bronchitis, Fever, Ague,            Diphtheria, Hysteria, Rheumatism, Diarrhoea, Spasms,              Colic, Renal and Uterine Diseases, are immediately                           relieved by a dose of                                 =CHLORODYNE.=                                (_Trade Mark._)    Discovered and named by DR. J. COLLIS BROWNE, M.R.C.S.L., Ex-Army  Medical Staff.    The question asked by invalids, families, and households is, What is the  best medicine to give in the above diseases, and what to have always  ready? Medical testimony, the reply of thousands of sufferers and  invalids, is confirmatory of the invaluable relief afforded by this  remedy above all others.    CHLORODYNE is a liquid taken in drops according to age. It invariably  relieves pain of whatever kind; creates a calm, refreshing sleep; allays  irritation of the nervous system when all other remedies fail; leaving  no bad effects, like opium or laudanum, and can be taken when none other  can be tolerated. Its value in saving life in infancy is not easily  estimated; a few drops will subdue the irritation of Teething, prevent  and arrest Convulsions, cure Whooping Cough, Spasms, and Flatus at once.    Among invalids it allays the pain of Neuralgia, Rheumatism, Gout, etc.  It soothes the weary achings of Consumption, relieves the Soreness of  the Chest, Cough, and Expectoration; and cures all Chest Affections,  such as Asthma, Bronchitis, Palpitation, etc. It checks Diarrhoea,  Alvine Discharges, or Spasms, and Colics of the Intestines, etc.    The extensive demand for this remedy, known as"]]]
