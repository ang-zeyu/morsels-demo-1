My host replied--\"Do you not perceive that a literature such as you mean  would be wholly incompatible with that perfection of social or political  felicity at which you do us the honour to think we have arrived? We have  at last, after centuries of struggle, settled into a form of government  with which we are content, and in which, as we allow no differences of  rank, and no honours are paid to administrators distinguishing them from  others, there is no stimulus given to individual ambition. No one would  read works advocating theories that involved any political or social  change, and therefore no one writes them. If now and then an An feels  himself dissatisfied with our tranquil mode of life, he does not attack  it; he goes away. Thus all that part of literature (and to judge by the  ancient books in our public libraries, it was once a very large part),  which relates to speculative theories on society is become utterly  extinct. Again, formerly there was a vast deal written respecting  the attributes and essence of the All-Good, and the arguments for and  against a future state; but now we all recognise two facts, that there  IS a Divine Being, and there IS a future state, and we all equally agree  that if we wrote our fingers to the bone, we could not throw any light  upon the nature and conditions of that future state, or quicken our  apprehensions of the attributes and essence of that Divine Being. Thus  another part of literature has become also extinct, happily for our  race; for in the time when so much was written on subjects which no one  could determine, people seemed to live in a perpetual state of quarrel  and contention. So, too, a vast part of our ancient literature consists  of historical records of wars an revolutions during the times when the  Ana lived in large and turbulent societies, each seeking aggrandisement  at the expense of the other. You see our serene mode of life now; such  it has been for ages. We have no events to chronicle. What more of us  can be said than that, 'they were born, they were happy, they died?'  Coming next to that part of literature which is more under the control  of the imagination, such as what we call Glaubsila, or colloquially  'Glaubs,' and you call poetry, the reasons for its decline amongst us  are abundantly obvious.    \"We find, by referring to the great masterpieces in that department  of literature which we all still read with pleasure, but of which none  would tolerate imitations, that they consist in the portraiture of  passions which we no longer experience--ambition, vengeance, unhallowed  love, the thirst for warlike renown, and suchlike. The old poets lived  in an atmosphere impregnated with these passions, and felt vividly what  they expressed glowingly. No one can express such passions now, for no  one can feel them, or meet with any sympathy in his readers if he did.  Again, the old poetry has a main element in its dissection of those  complex mysteries of human character which conduce to abnormal vices and  crimes, or lead to signal and extraordinary virtues. But our society,  having got rid of temptations to any prominent vices and crimes, has  necessarily rendered the moral average so equal, that there are no  very salient virtues. Without its ancient food of strong passions, vast  crimes, heroic excellences, poetry therefore is, if not actually starved  to death, reduced to a very meagre diet. There is still the poetry of  description--description of rocks, and trees, and waters, and common  household life; and our young Gy-ei weave much of this insipid kind of  composition into their love verses.\"    \"Such poetry,\" said I, \"might surely be made very charming; and we have  critics amongst us who consider it a higher kind than that which depicts  the crimes, or analyses the passions, of man. At all events, poetry of  the inspired kind you mention is a poetry that nowadays commands more  readers than any other among the people I have left above ground.\"    \"Possibly; but then I suppose the writers take great pains with the  language they employ, and devote themselves to the culture and polish of  words and rhythms of an art?\"    \"Certainly they do: all great poets do that. Though the gift of poetry  may be inborn, the gift requires as much care to make it available as a  block of metal does to be made into one of your engines.\"    \"And doubtless your poets have some incentive to bestow all those pains  upon such verbal prettinesses?\"    \"Well, I presume their instinct of song would make them sing as the bird  does; but to cultivate the song into verbal or artificial prettiness,  probably does need an inducement from without, and our poets find it in  the love of fame--perhaps, now and then, in the want of money.\"    \"Precisely so. But in our society we attach fame to nothing which man,  in that moment of his duration which is called 'life,' can perform. We  should soon lose that equality which constitutes the felicitous essence  of our commonwealth if we selected any individual for pre-eminent  praise: pre-eminent praise would confer pre-eminent power, and the  moment it were given, evil passions, now dormant, would awake: other  men would immediately covet praise, then would arise envy, and with envy  hate, and with hate calumny and persecution. Our history tells us that  most of the poets and most of the writers who, in the old time, were  favoured with the greatest praise, were also assailed by the greatest  vituperation, and even, on the whole, rendered very unhappy, partly  by the attacks of jealous rivals, partly by the diseased mental  constitution which an acquired sensitiveness to praise and to blame  tends to engender. As for the stimulus of want; in the first place, no  man in our community knows the goad of poverty; and, secondly, if he  did, almost every occupation would be more lucrative than writing.    \"Our public libraries contain all the books of the past which time has  preserved; those books, for the reasons above stated, are infinitely  better than any can write nowadays, and they are open to all to read  without cost. We are not such fools as to pay for reading inferior  books, when we can read superior books for nothing.\"    \"With us, novelty has an attraction; and a new book, if bad, is read  when an old book, though good, is neglected.\"    \"Novelty, to barbarous states of society struggling in despair for  something better, has no doubt an attraction, denied to us, who see  nothing to gain in novelties; but after all, it is observed by one of  our great authors four thousand years ago, that 'he who studies old  books will always find in them something new, and he who reads new books  will always find in them something old.' But to return to the question  you have raised, there being then amongst us no stimulus to painstaking  labour, whether in desire of fame or in pressure of want, such as have  the poetic temperament, no doubt vent it in song, as you say the bird  sings; but for lack of elaborate culture it fails of an audience,  and, failing of an audience, dies out, of itself, amidst the ordinary  avocations of life.\"    \"But how is it that these discouragements to the cultivation of  literature do not operate against that of science?\"    \"Your question amazes me. The motive to science is the love of truth  apart from all consideration of fame, and science with us too is devoted  almost solely to practical uses, essential to our social conversation  and the comforts of our daily life. No fame is asked by the inventor,  and none is given to him; he enjoys an occupation congenial to his  tastes, and needing no wear and tear of the passions. Man must have  exercise for his mind as well as body; and continuous exercise, rather  than violent, is best for both. Our most ingenious cultivators of  science are, as a general rule, the longest lived and the most free from  disease. Painting is an amusement to many, but the art is not what it  was in former times, when the great painters in our various communities  vied with each other for the prize of a golden crown, which gave them a  social rank equal to that of the kings under whom they lived. You  will thus doubtless have observed in our archaeological department how  superior in point of art the pictures were several thousand years ago.  Perhaps it is because music is, in reality, more allied to science than  it is to poetry, that, of all the pleasurable arts, music is that which  flourishes the most amongst us. Still, even in music the absence of  stimulus in praise or fame has served to prevent any great superiority  of one individual over another; and we rather excel in choral music,  with the aid of our vast mechanical instruments, in which we make great  use of the agency of water,* than in single performers.\"    * This may remind the student of Nero's invention of a musical machine,  by which water was made to perform the part of an orchestra, and on  which he was employed when the conspiracy against him broke out.    \"We have had scarcely any original composer for some ages. Our favorite  airs are very ancient in substance, but have admitted many complicated  variations by inferior, though ingenious, musicians.\"    \"Are there no political societies among the Ana which are animated  by those passions, subjected to those crimes, and admitting those  disparities in condition, in intellect, and in morality, which the state  of your tribe, or indeed of the Vril-ya generally, has left behind in  its progress to perfection? If so, among such societies perhaps Poetry  and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#17)"],[1,"crypt and upward to the small  chamber above the eastern chapels. This is popularly known as Oliver  Cromwell's harness room, and marks are shown on the wall supposed to  have been holes for the insertion of pegs whereon he hung his harness;  but as the Protector never came to Christchurch, all this is purely  mythical. On one of the walls Mr Ferrey, the architect, found a design  for a window; this he copied, and used when designing the tracery of the  window he inserted over the prior's door at the east end of the south  aisle of the nave. This tracing chamber is lighted by a two-light window  with a quatrefoil in the head in the eastern wall. The two chapels below  are beautiful examples of transition work from the Early English to the  Decorated style; they were built by the De Redvers, Earls of Devon, the  last of whom died in 1263. The eagles of the Montacute and Monthermer  families appear in this chantry. There are two windows in the eastern  wall. The larger, on the north, consists of three lights, with three  circles in the head; the foliation of these outside the glass forms  cinquefoil openings; the smaller window is of a similar character, but  consists of two lights only, with a single foliated arch above them. An  archway, widely splayed, on the western side, opens into the transept,  and another archway opens into the choir aisle; this has a panelled  pier, standing a little apart from the eastern side, designed to support  the arch, which probably was found to be giving way. The shafts along  the eastern wall, the capitals of one of which is carved with a number  of heads said to represent the twelve apostles, should be noticed; the  vaulting ribs are also interesting, especially the joggled ribs seen  over the window. A stone altar stood in one of these chantries until  1780. These chapels are sadly disfigured by a mean staircase which leads  into the transept gallery; it is devoutly to be hoped that before long  this may be removed, and the exquisite beauty of the chapels seen  without any inharmonious and irritating feature such as this staircase  undoubtedly is. Below the transept is an Early Norman crypt; it is  thought by some, from the rudeness of the work, that it may be of  earlier date than the existing church, and that it belonged to the  original church which Flambard destroyed to make room for his more  splendid edifice. In it were discovered a number of human bones, which  were reinterred in the churchyard. It has a plain barrel roof, divided  by broad flat arches rising from pilasters.    [Illustration: THE NORTH AISLE OF NAVE.]    It has often been debated whether or not the church ever possessed a  central tower. There is no documentary evidence bearing on the question.  It may be said that if a tower existed and fell, or was pulled down for  any reason, some record would have remained; but the records connected  with the building are fragmentary, and it by no means follows that the  absence of record proves the non-existence of such a tower. In the case  of Wimborne Minster the churchwarden's accounts contain no record of the  building or of the fall of the spire, yet we know from outside testimony  that such a spire did fall in 1600, and that a representation of it  occurs on a seal. So here at Christchurch a seal is in existence on  which the church is represented with a central tower of two storeys, the  lower plain, the upper lighted by two round-headed windows and capped by  a low pyramidal spire or roof with a tall cross on the summit. This is  exactly what one would expect to find: a central tower is almost always  found in Norman churches, especially collegiate churches; and the  pyramidal roof was almost certainly the usual form in which these early  towers were finished. The battlemented parapets which we so often meet  with in Norman towers are in all cases more recent additions. Moreover,  the massive arches and piers at the corners indicate that a tower was  contemplated, even if it were never built. In the east gable of the nave  as it at present exists, two round-headed windows may be seen. It is  highly probable that this gable once formed part of the east wall of the  tower, and when the tower was removed this wall was converted into a  gable. Everything to the east of the crossing being of late fourteenth  or early fifteenth century date, indicates that extensive alterations  were made at that time; and if a tower and spire had previously existed,  it must have been removed before this date. In the centre of the carving  over the doorway leading into the Draper chantry, dated 1529, there is a  representation of a church with a central tower and spire. Of course, no  such steeple existed at the time this chantry was built, but it may have  been a copy of some then existing representation of the building as it  had appeared in former times. There are also two other carvings of  angels carrying a model of a church with a central tower--one near the  Salisbury chantry, one on the choir roof.    [Illustration: THE CRYPT.]    The nave is divided from the choir by a splendid rood screen 16 feet 6  inches high, 33 feet long, and 9 feet thick. The western face of this  projects beyond the line joining the east walls of the two transepts;  its eastern face rests against the eastern piers intended to support the  central tower. It was extensively restored by Mr Ferrey in 1848, who  considered that it may have been removed from some conventual church  after the dissolution of the monasteries in the time of Henry VIII. and  re-erected here. But there does not seem to be any real grounds for  supposing that it was not expressly built for this church. Its character  indicates a date somewhat late in the fourteenth century. In the centre  is a narrow doorway and a passage into the choir; from the north side  of this passage a flight of steps leads to the top of the loft. The  base of the screen is plain; above this is a row of thirteen panelled  quatrefoils on each side of the doorway--each containing a plain shield,  over these a string course, then two rows of canopied niches, the upper  row consisting of twelve, the lower, owing to the doorway occupying the  central space, of only ten. The lower niches have pedestals, each formed  of four short columns with detached bases but with large capitals, which  meet one another above; these capitals are richly carved with foliage.  No doubt, on the level space thus formed statues at one time stood.  Woodwork screens with glazed doors and panels, made from an oak screen  which formerly was placed across the south transept, run across the  western ends of the choir aisles, so that when the doors of these and of  the rood screen are locked, the eastern arm of the cross is entirely  shut off from the rest of the church.    [Illustration: THE ROOD SCREEN.]    [Illustration: STALL SEAT. South Side.]    [Illustration: STALL SEAT. North Side.]    [Illustration: STALL SEAT. North Side.]    The #Choir# is entirely Perpendicular in character, and it seems to  have been begun in the time of Henry VI. but not to have been completed  until the time of Henry VII., and some of the carving of the stalls  is of still later date. Leland says of it, \"Baldwin, Earl of Devon,  was the first founder, and his successors to the time of Isabella de  Fortibus,[5] and at present the Earls of Salisbury are regarded as  founders.\" Four large clerestory windows on either side light the choir.  The wall beneath these is continued downwards to the floor, but under  each window a low obtusely-pointed depressed archway is cut leading  into the aisles. Between the bottom of each clerestory window and the  heads of these arches the wall is panelled as with window mullions  and tracery, so that the appearance from the inner side may be best  understood by imagining that each window extended from floor to roof,  but that the upper part alone is glazed, the lower cut away for the arch  leading into the aisle, and the lower lights beneath the transom blocked  up with masonry. These lower arches are more or less blocked up.  The Salisbury chapel blocks up the north-eastern one completely; the  sedilia, no doubt, occupied the opposite one, where now a modern altar  tomb may be seen. The next on each side to the west is open, and flights  of steps under them lead down to the aisles; the woodwork at the back  of the choir stalls close the remaining two on the inside, and on the  outside chantry chapels, opening one into the north one into the south  aisle, stand under the second arch on each side counting from the rood  screen. The upper stalls number in all thirty-six, fifteen on either  side, and six with their backs to the rood screen. There is, also,  a lower range of stalls on the north and south. The prior's and  sub-prior's stalls on either side the doorway in the screen looking  east are canopied, as also is the precentor's at the east end of the  south side. The arms of the stalls are quaintly carved with various  grotesque figures, as are also the misereres; the upper parts of the  panels behind the upper stalls are also carved in low relief; above  these is a projecting cornice decorated with pinnacles. The stalls are  late Perpendicular work, the wainscoting behind the stalls being later  still, as we can see from the subjects carved on the upper part of each  panel. Some of the misereres are, however, very old--one dates back to  about 1200, another to 1300, others are of later date, and most of them  belong to the same period as the stalls. The older ones were found lying  about in the lumber of the church, and have been placed in recent years  in some of the stalls the seats of which had been lost or stolen.  The older seats may have belonged to the original Norman choir. As the  term \"miserere\" may not be understood by all our readers, it may be  well to quote from Parker's \"Glossary of Architecture\" the following  description:--\"Miserere, Misericorde,"]]]
