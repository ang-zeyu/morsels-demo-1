One can, for example,  compare red with blue or sweet with sour, and tell which quality he  prefers. But let him try to compare red with sweet, or blue with sour,  and the quality-difference is so profound that there seems to be no  basis for comparison.    Differences in _intensity_ of sensation are familiar to every person who  prefers two lumps of sugar rather than one lump in his coffee; the sweet  is of the same quality in either case, but differs in intensity. In  every field of sensation, the intensity may proceed from the smallest  amount to the greatest amount discernible. In general, the intensity of  the sensation depends on the intensity of the stimulus, though the  condition of the sense-organ as regards fatigue or adaptation to the  stimulus has its effect. It is obvious that a stimulus may be too weak  to produce any sensation; as, for example, a few grains of sugar in a  cup of coffee or a few drops of lemon in a quart of water could not be  detected. It is also true that the intensity of the stimulus may be so  great that an increase in intensity produces no effect on the sensation;  as, for example, the addition of sugar to a solution of saccharine would  not noticeably increase its sweetness. The lowest and highest intensity  points of sensation are called the lower and upper _limen_, or  threshold, respectively.    By _extensity_ is meant the space-differences of sensations. The touch  of the point of a toothpick on the skin has a different space quality  from the touch of the flat end of a pencil. Low tones seem to have more  volume than high tones. Some pains feel sharp and others dull and  diffuse. The warmth felt from spreading the palms of the hands out to  the fire has a \"bigness\" not felt from heating one solitary finger. The  extensity of a sensation depends on the number of nerve endings  stimulated.    The _duration_ of a sensation refers to the time it lasts. This must not  be confused with the duration of the stimulus, which may be either  longer or shorter than the duration of the sensation. Every sensation  must exist for some space of time, long or short, or it would have no  part in consciousness.      3. SENSORY QUALITIES AND THEIR END-ORGANS    All are familiar with the \"five senses\" of our elementary physiologies,  sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. A more complete study of  sensation reveals nearly three times this number, however. This is to  say that the body is equipped with more than a dozen different kinds of  end-organs, each prepared to receive its own particular type of  stimulus. It must also be understood that some of the end-organs yield  more than one sense. The eye, for example, gives not only visual but  muscular sensations; the ear not only auditory, but tactual; the tongue  not only gustatory, but tactual and cold and warmth sensations.    SIGHT.--Vision is a _distance_ sense; we can see afar off. The stimulus  is _chemical_ in its action; this means that the ether waves, on  striking the retina, cause a chemical change which sets up the nerve  current responsible for the sensation.    The eye, whose general structure is sufficiently described in all  standard physiologies, consists of a visual apparatus designed to bring  the images of objects to a clear focus on the retina at the _fovea_, or  area of clearest vision, near the point of entrance of the optic nerve.    The sensation of sight coming from this retinal image unaided by other  sensations gives us but two qualities, _light and color_. The eye can  distinguish many different grades of light from purest white on through  the various grays to densest black. The range is greater still in color.  We speak of the seven colors of the spectrum, violet, indigo, blue,  green, yellow, orange, and red. But this is not a very serviceable  classification, since the average eye can distinguish about 35,000 color  effects. It is also somewhat bewildering to find that all these colors  seem to be produced from the four fundamental hues, red, green, yellow,  and blue, plus the various tints. These four, combined in varying  proportions and with different degrees of light (i.e., different shades  of gray), yield all the color effects known to the human eye. Herschel  estimates that the workers on the mosaics at Rome must have  distinguished 30,000 different color tones. The _hue_ of a color refers  to its fundamental quality, as red or yellow; the _chroma_, to its  saturation, or the strength of the color; and the _tint,_ to the amount  of brightness (i.e., white) it contains.    HEARING.--Hearing is also a distance sense. The action of its stimulus  is mechanical, which is to say that the vibrations produced in the air  by the sounding body are finally transmitted by the mechanism of the  middle ear to the inner ear. Here the impulse is conveyed through the  liquid of the internal ear to the nerve endings as so many tiny blows,  which produce the nerve current carried to the brain by the auditory  nerve.    The sensation of hearing, like that of sight, gives us two qualities:  namely, _tones_ with their accompanying pitch and timbre, and _noises_.  Tones, or musical sounds, are produced by isochronous or equal-timed  vibrations; thus _C_ of the first octave is produced by 256 vibrations a  second, and if this tone is prolonged the vibration rate will continue  uniformly the same. Noises, on the other hand, are produced by  vibrations which have no uniformity of vibration rate. The ear's  sensibility to pitch extends over about seven octaves. The seven-octave  piano goes down to 27-1/2 vibrations and reaches up to 3,500 vibrations.  Notes of nearly 50,000 vibrations can be heard by an average ear,  however, though these are too painfully shrill to be musical. Taking  into account this upper limit, the range of the ear is about eleven  octaves. The ear, having given us _loudness_ of tones, which depends on  the amplitude of the vibrations, _pitch_, which depends on the rapidity  of the vibrations, and _timbre_, or _quality_, which depends on the  complexity of the vibrations, has no further qualities of sound to  reveal.    TASTE.--The sense of taste is located chiefly in the tongue, over the  surface of which are scattered many minute _taste-bulbs_. These can be  seen as small red specks, most plentifully distributed along the edges  and at the tip of the tongue. The substance tasted must be in  _solution_, and come in contact with the nerve endings. The action of  the stimulus is _chemical_.    The sense of taste recognizes the four qualities of _sour_, _sweet_,  _salt_, and _bitter_. Many of the qualities which we improperly call  tastes are in reality a complex of taste, smell, touch, and temperature.  Smell contributes so largely to the sense of taste that many articles of  food become \"tasteless\" when we have a catarrh, and many nauseating  doses of medicine can be taken without discomfort if the nose is held.  Probably none of us, if we are careful to exclude all odors by plugging  the nostrils with cotton, can by taste distinguish between scraped  apple, potato, turnip, or beet, or can tell hot milk from tea or coffee  of the same temperature.    SMELL.--In the upper part of the nasal cavity lies a small brownish  patch of mucous membrane. It is here that the olfactory nerve endings  are located. The substance smelled must be volatile, that is, must exist  in gaseous form, and come in direct contact with the nerve endings.  Chemical action results in a nerve current.    The sensations of smell have not been classified so well as those of  taste, and we have no distinct names for them. Neither do we know how  many olfactory qualities the sense of smell is capable of revealing. The  only definite classification of smell qualities is that based on their  pleasantness or the opposite. We also borrow a few terms and speak of  _sweet_ or _fragrant_ odors and _fresh_ or _close_ smells. There is some  evidence when we observe animals, or even primitive men, that the human  race has been evolving greater sensibility to certain odors, while at  the same time there has been a loss of keenness of what we call scent.    VARIOUS SENSATIONS FROM THE SKIN.--The skin, besides being a protective  and excretory organ, affords a lodging-place for the end-organs giving  us our sense of pressure, pain, cold, warmth, tickle, and itch.  _Pressure_ seems to have for its end-organ the _hair-bulbs_ of the skin;  on hairless regions small bulbs called the _corpuscles of Meissner_  serve this purpose. _Pain_ is thought to be mediated by free nerve  endings. _Cold_ depends on end-organs called the _bulbs of Krause_; and  _warmth_ on the _Ruffinian corpuscles_.    Cutaneous or skin sensation may arise from either _mechanical_  stimulation, such as pressure, a blow, or tickling, from _thermal_  stimulation from hot or cold objects, from _electrical_ stimulation, or  from the action of certain _chemicals_, such as acids and the like.  Stimulated mechanically, the skin gives us but two sensation qualities,  _pressure_ and _pain_. Many of the qualities which we commonly ascribe  to the skin sensations are really a complex of cutaneous and muscular  sensations. _Contact_ is light pressure. _Hardness_ and _softness_  depend on the intensity of the pressure. _Roughness_ and _smoothness_  arise from interrupted and continuous pressure, respectively, and  require movement over the rough or smooth surface. _Touch_ depends on  pressure accompanied by the muscular sensations involved in the  movements connected with the act. Pain is clearly a different sensation  from pressure; but any of the cutaneous or muscular sensations may, by  excessive stimulation, be made to pass over into pain. All parts of the  skin are sensitive to pressure and pain; but certain parts, like the  finger tips, and the tip of the tongue, are more highly sensitive than"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20239"],[0,"The Ten Books on Architecture (#17)"],[1,"iations.    11. For the thickness of the shafts must be enlarged in proportion to  the increase of the distance between the columns. In the araeostyle, for  instance, if only a ninth or tenth part is given to the thickness, the  column will look thin and mean, because the width of the  intercolumniations is such that the air seems to eat away and diminish  the thickness of such shafts. On the other hand, in pycnostyles, if an  eighth part is given to the thickness, it will make the shaft look  swollen and ungraceful, because the intercolumniations are so close to  each other and so narrow. We must therefore follow the rules of symmetry  required by each kind of building. Then, too, the columns at the corners  should be made thicker than the others by a fiftieth of their own  diameter, because they are sharply outlined by the unobstructed air  round them, and seem to the beholder more slender than they are. Hence,  we must counteract the ocular deception by an adjustment of proportions.    [Illustration: THE DIMINUTION OF COLUMNS IN RELATION TO THEIR DIMENSIONS  OF HEIGHT]    12. Moreover, the diminution in the top of a column at the necking seems  to be regulated on the following principles: if a column is fifteen feet  or under, let the thickness at the bottom be divided into six parts,  and let five of those parts form the thickness at the top. If it is from  fifteen feet to twenty feet, let the bottom of the shaft be divided into  six and a half parts, and let five and a half of those parts be the  upper thickness of the column. In a column of from twenty feet to thirty  feet, let the bottom of the shaft be divided into seven parts, and let  the diminished top measure six of these. A column of from thirty to  forty feet should be divided at the bottom into seven and a half parts,  and, on the principle of diminution, have six and a half of these at the  top. Columns of from forty feet to fifty should be divided into eight  parts, and diminish to seven of these at the top of the shaft under the  capital. In the case of higher columns, let the diminution be determined  proportionally, on the same principles.    13. These proportionate enlargements are made in the thickness of  columns on account of the different heights to which the eye has to  climb. For the eye is always in search of beauty, and if we do not  gratify its desire for pleasure by a proportionate enlargement in these  measures, and thus make compensation for ocular deception, a clumsy and  awkward appearance will be presented to the beholder. With regard to the  enlargement made at the middle of columns, which among the Greeks is  called [Greek: entasis], at the end of the book a figure and calculation  will be subjoined, showing how an agreeable and appropriate effect may  be produced by it.          CHAPTER IV    THE FOUNDATIONS AND SUBSTRUCTURES OF TEMPLES      1. The foundations of these works should be dug out of the solid ground,  if it can be found, and carried down into solid ground as far as the  magnitude of the work shall seem to require, and the whole substructure  should be as solid as it can possibly be laid. Above ground, let walls  be laid under the columns, thicker by one half than the columns are to  be, so that the lower may be stronger than the higher. Hence they are  called \"stereobates\"; for they take the load. And the projections of the  bases should not extend beyond this solid foundation. The wall-thickness  is similarly to be preserved above ground likewise, and the intervals  between these walls should be vaulted over, or filled with earth rammed  down hard, to keep the walls well apart.    [Illustration: THE ENTASIS OF COLUMNS    1. The entasis as given by Fra Giocondo in the edition of 1511.    2. The entasis from the temple of Mars Ultor in Rome compared with  Vignola's rule for entasis.]    2. If, however, solid ground cannot be found, but the place proves to be  nothing but a heap of loose earth to the very bottom, or a marsh, then  it must be dug up and cleared out and set with piles made of charred  alder or olive wood or oak, and these must be driven down by machinery,  very closely together like bridge-piles, and the intervals between them  filled in with charcoal, and finally the foundations are to be laid on  them in the most solid form of construction. The foundations having been  brought up to the level, the stylobates are next to be put in place.    3. The columns are then to be distributed over the stylobates in the  manner above described: close together in the pycnostyle; in the  systyle, diastyle, or eustyle, as they are described and arranged above.  In araeostyle temples one is free to arrange them as far apart as one  likes. Still, in peripterals, the columns should be so placed that there  are twice as many intercolumniations on the sides as there are in front;  for thus the length of the work will be twice its breadth. Those who  make the number of columns double, seem to be in error, because then the  length seems to be one intercolumniation longer than it ought to be.    4. The steps in front must be arranged so that there shall always be an  odd number of them; for thus the right foot, with which one mounts the  first step, will also be the first to reach the level of the temple  itself. The rise of such steps should, I think, be limited to not more  than ten nor less than nine inches; for then the ascent will not be  difficult. The treads of the steps ought to be made not less than a foot  and a half, and not more than two feet deep. If there are to be steps  running all round the temple, they should be built of the same size.    5. But if a podium is to be built on three sides round the temple, it  should be so constructed that its plinths, bases, dies, coronae, and  cymatiumare appropriate to the actual stylobate which is to be under the  bases of the columns.    [Illustration: FRA GIOCONDO'S IDEA OF THE \"SCAMILLI IMPARES\"    (From his edition of Vitruvius, Venice, 1511)]    The level of the stylobate must be increased along the middle by the  scamilli impares; for if it is laid perfectly level, it will look to the  eye as though it were hollowed a little. At the end of the book a figure  will be found, with a description showing how the scamilli may be made  to suit this purpose.          CHAPTER V    PROPORTIONS OF THE BASE, CAPITALS, AND ENTABLATURE IN THE IONIC ORDER      1. This finished, let the bases of the columns be set in place, and  constructed in such proportions that their height, including the plinth,  may be half the thickness of a column, and their projection (called in  Greek [Greek: ekphora]) the same.[1] Thus in both length and breadth it  will be one and one half thicknesses of a column.    [Note 1: Reading _aeque tantam_ as in new _Rose._ Codd. _sextantem;_  Schn. _quadrantem._]    2. If the base is to be in the Attic style, let its height be so divided  that the upper part shall be one third part of the thickness of the  column, and the rest left for the plinth. Then, excluding the plinth,  let the rest be divided into four parts, and of these let one fourth  constitute the upper torus, and let the other three be divided equally,  one part composing the lower torus, and the other, with its fillets, the  scotia, which the Greeks call [Greek: trochilos].    3. But if Ionic bases are to be built, their proportions shall be so  determined that the base may be each way equal in breadth to the  thickness of a column plus three eighths of the thickness; its height  that of the Attic base, and so too its plinth; excluding the plinth, let  the rest, which will be a third part of the thickness of a column, be  divided into seven parts. Three of these parts constitute the torus at  the top, and the other four are to be divided equally, one part  constituting the upper trochilus with its astragals and overhang, the  other left for the lower trochilus. But the lower will seem to be  larger, because it will project to the edge of the plinth. The astragals  must be one eighth of the trochilus. The projection of the base will be  three sixteenths of the thickness of a column.    [Illustration: THE IONIC ORDER ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS COMPARED WITH THE  ORDER OF THE MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS    The difference between the Roman and the Greek relation of the  baluster-side of the capital to the echinus is to be noted.]    4. The bases being thus finished and put in place, the columns are to be  put in place: the middle columns of the front and rear porticoes  perpendicular to their own centre; the corner columns, and those which  are to extend in a line from them along the sides of the temple to the  right and left, are to be set so that their inner sides, which face  toward the cella wall, are perpendicular, but their outer sides in the  manner which I have described in speaking of their diminution. Thus, in  the design of the temple the lines will be adjusted with due regard to  the diminution.    5. The shafts of the columns having been erected, the rule for the  capitals will be as follows. If they are to be cushion-shaped, they  should be so proportioned that the abacus is in length and breadth  equivalent to the thickness of the shaft at its bottom plus one  eighteenth thereof, and the height of the capital, including the  volutes, one half of that amount. The faces of the volutes must recede  from the edge of the abacus inwards by one and a half eighteenths of  that same amount. Then, the height of the capital is to be divided into  nine and a half parts, and down along the abacus on the four sides of  the volutes, down along the fillet at the edge of the abacus, lines  called \"catheti\" are to be let fall. Then, of the nine and a half parts  let one and a half be reserved for the height of the abacus, and let the  other eight be used for the volutes.    6. Then let another line be drawn, beginning at a point situated at a  distance of one and a half parts toward the inside from"]]]
