He  learnt the manner of using colours from the works of Leonardo da Vinci  and Fratre Bartolomeo: to all this he added the contemplation of all the  remains of antiquity that were within his reach, and employed others to  draw for him what was in Greece and distant places.  And it is from his  having taken so many models that he became himself a model for all  succeeding painters, always imitating, and always original.    If your ambition therefore be to equal Raffaelle, you must do as  Raffaelle did; take many models, and not take even him for your guide  alone to the exclusion of others.  And yet the number is infinite of  those who seem, if one may judge by their style, to have seen no other  works but those of their master, or of some favourite whose manner is  their first wish and their last.    I will mention a few that occur to me of this narrow, confined,  illiberal, unscientific, and servile kind of imitators.  Guido was thus  meanly copied by Elizabetta Sirani, and Simone Cantarini; Poussin, by  Verdier and Cheron; Parmigiano, by Jeronimo Mazzuoli; Paolo Veronese and  Iacomo Bassan had for their imitators their brothers and sons; Pietro de  Cortona was followed by Ciro Ferri and Romanelli; Rubens, by Jacques  Jordans and Diepenbeck; Guercino, by his own family, the Gennari; Carlo  Marratti was imitated by Giuseppe Chiari and Pietro da Pietri; and  Rembrandt, by Bramer, Eckhout, and Flink.  All these, to whom may be  added a much longer list of painters, whose works among the ignorant pass  for those of their masters, are justly to be censured for barrenness and  servility.    To oppose to this list a few that have adopted a more liberal style of  imitation: Pelegrino Tibaldi, Rosso, and Primaticio did not coldly  imitate, but caught something of the fire that animates the works of  Michael Angelo.  The Carraches formed their style from Pelegrino Tibaldi,  Correggio, and the Venetian School.  Domenichino, Guido, Lanfranco,  Albano, Guercino, Cavidone, Schidone, Tiarini, though it is sufficiently  apparent that they came from the School of the Carraches, have yet the  appearance of men who extended their views beyond the model that lay  before them, and have shown that they had opinions of their own, and  thought for themselves, after they had made themselves masters of the  general principles of their schools.    Le Seure's first manner resembles very much that of his master Vovet: but  as he soon excelled him, so he differed from him in every part of the  art.  Carlo Marratti succeeded better than those I have first named, and  I think owes his superiority to the extension of his views; besides his  master Andrea Sacchi, he imitated Raffaelle, Guido, and the Carraches.  It  is true, there is nothing very captivating in Carlo Marratti; but this  proceeded from wants which cannot be completely supplied; that is, want  of strength of parts.  In this, certainly men are not equal, and a man  can bring home wares only in proportion to the capital with which he goes  to market.  Carlo, by diligence, made the most of what he had; but there  was undoubtedly a heaviness about him, which extended itself, uniformly  to his invention, expression, his drawing, colouring, and the general  effect of his pictures.  The truth is, he never equalled any of his  patterns in any one thing, and he added little of his own.    But we must not rest contented, even in this general study of the  moderns; we must trace back the art to its fountain head, to that source  from whence they drew their principal excellences, the monuments of pure  antiquity.    All the inventions and thoughts of the ancients, whether conveyed to us  in statues, bas-reliefs, intaglios, cameos, or coins, are to be sought  after and carefully studied: The genius that hovers over these venerable  relics may be called the father of modern art.    From the remains of the works of the ancients the modern arts were  revived, and it is by their means that they must be restored a second  time.  However it may mortify our vanity, we must be forced to allow them  our masters; and we may venture to prophecy, that when they shall cease  to be studied, arts will no longer flourish, and we shall again relapse  into barbarism.    The fire of the artist's own genius operating upon these materials which  have been thus diligently collected, will enable him to make new  combinations, perhaps, superior to what had ever before been in the  possession of the art.  As in the mixture of the variety of metals, which  are said to have been melted and run together at the burning of Corinth,  a new and till then unknown metal was produced equal in value to any of  those that had contributed to its composition.  And though a curious  refiner may come with his crucibles, analyse and separate its various  component parts, yet Corinthian brass would still hold its rank amongst  the most beautiful and valuable of metals.    We have hitherto considered the advantages of imitation as it tends to  form the taste, and as a practice by which a spark of that genius may be  caught which illumines these noble works, that ought always to be present  to our thoughts.    We come now to speak of another kind of imitation; the borrowing a  particular thought, an action, attitude, or figure, and transplanting it  into your own work: this will either come under the charge of plagiarism,  or be warrantable, and deserve commendation, according to the address  with which it is performed.  There is some difference likewise whether it  is upon the ancients or the moderns that these depredations are made.  It  is generally allowed that no man need be ashamed of copying the ancients:  their works are considered as a magazine of common property, always open  to the public, whence every man has a right to what materials he pleases;  and if he has the art of using them, they are supposed to become to all  intents and purposes his own property.    The collection which Raffaelle made of the thoughts of the ancients with  so much trouble, is a proof of his opinion on this subject.  Such  collections may be made with much more ease, by means of an art scarce  known in his time; I mean that of engraving, by which, at an easy rate,  every man may now avail himself of the inventions of antiquity.    It must be acknowledged that the works of the moderns are more the  property of their authors; he who borrows an idea from an artist, or  perhaps from a modern, not his contemporary, and so accommodates it to  his own work that it makes a part of it, with no seam or joining  appearing, can hardly be charged with plagiarism; poets practise this  kind of borrowing without reserve.  But an artist should not be contented  with this only; he should enter into a competition with his original, and  endeavour to improve what he is appropriating to his own work.  Such  imitation is so far from having anything in it of the servility of  plagiarism, that it is a perpetual exercise of the mind, a continual  invention.    Borrowing or stealing with such art and caution will have a right to the  same lenity as was used by the Lacedemonians; who did not punish theft,  but the want of artifice to conceal it.    In order to encourage you to imitation, to the utmost extent, let me add,  that very finished artists in the inferior branches of the art will  contribute to furnish the mind and give hints of which a skilful painter,  who is sensible of what he wants, and is in no danger of being infected  by the contact of vicious models, will know how to avail himself.  He  will pick up from dunghills what by a nice chemistry, passing through his  own mind, shall be converted into pure gold; and, under the rudeness of  Gothic essays, he will find original, rational, and even sublime  inventions.    In the luxuriant style of Paul Veronese, in the capricious compositions  of Tintoret, he will find something that will assist his invention, and  give points, from which his own imagination shall rise and take flight,  when the subject which he treats will, with propriety, admit of splendid  effects.    In every school, whether Venetian, French, or Dutch, he will find either  ingenious compositions, extraordinary effects, some peculiar expressions,  or some mechanical excellence, well worthy his attention and, in some  measure, of his imitation; even in the lower class of the French  painters, great beauties are often found united with great defects.    Though Coypel wanted a simplicity of taste, and mistook a presumptuous  and assuming air for what is grand and majestic; yet he frequently has  good sense and judgment in his manner of telling his stories, great skill  in his compositions, and is not without a considerable power of  expressing the passions, The modern affectation of grace in his works, as  well as in those of Bouche and Watteau, may be said to be separated by a  very thin partition from the more simple and pure grace of Correggio and  Parmigiano.    Amongst the Dutch painters, the correct, firm, and determined pencil,  which was employed by Bamboccio and Jan Miel on vulgar and mean subjects,  might without any change be employed on the highest, to which, indeed, it  seems more properly to belong.  The greatest style, if that style is  confined to small figures such as Poussin generally painted, would  receive an additional grace by the elegance and precision of pencil so  admirable in the works of Teniers.    Though this school more particularly excelled in the mechanism of  painting, yet there are many who have shown great abilities in expressing  what must be ranked above mechanical excellences.    In the works of Frank Hals the portrait painter may observe the  composition of a face, the features well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#17)"],[1,", carrying the genital ducts looped  over them. The oviducts of the female do not fuse distally to form a  median vagina as they do in the rabbit. In front of the genital organ in  both sexes is a corpus adiposum (c.ad.), which acts as a fat store,  and is peculiar to the frogs and toads. The distal end of the oviduct of  the female is in the breeding season (early March) enormously  distended with ova, and the ovaries become then the mere vestiges of  their former selves. The distal end of the oviduct is, therefore, not  unfrequently styled the uterus. There is no penis in the male,  fertilisation of the ova occurring as they are squeezed out of the  female by the embracing fore limbs of the male. The male has a pad,  black in winter, shown in Figure 1, which is closely pressed against  the ventral surface of the female in copulation, and which serves as a  ready means of distinguishing the sex.      Section 17. The spinal cord has a general similarity to that of the  rabbit; the ratio of its size to that of the brain is larger, and the  nerves number ten pairs altogether. The first of these (sp. 1, in  Figure 2, Sheet -12- ) {First Edition error.} [13] corresponds in  distribution with the rabbit's hypoglossal nerve, a point we shall refer to  again when we speak of the skull. The second and third constitute the  brachial plexus. The last three form the sciatic plexus going to the  hind limb.      Section 18. The same essential parts are to be found in the brain of  both frog and rabbit, but in the former the adult is not so widely  modified from the primitive condition as in the latter. The fore-brain  consists of a thalamencephalon (th.c. and 1), which is exposed in the  dorsal view of the brain, and which has no middle commissure. The  cerebral hemispheres (c.h.) are not convoluted, do not extend back to  cover parts behind them, as they do in the rabbit, and are not  connected above the roof of the thalamencephalon by a corpus  callosum. Moreover, the parts usually regarded, as the olfactory lobes  (rh.) fuse in the middle line. The mid-brain gives rise to the third  nerve, and has the optic lobes on its dorsal side, but these are hollow,  and they are not subdivided by a transverse groove into corpora  quadrigemina, as in the rabbit. In the hind-brain the cerebellum is a  mere band of tissue without lateral lobes or flocculi, and the medulla  gives origin only to nerves four to ten; there is no eleventh nerve, and  the hypoglossal is the first spinal-- from which it has been assumed  that the rabbit's medulla equals that of the frog, plus a portion of the  spinal cord incorporated with it. The hypoglossal is very distinctly  seen on opening the skin beneath the hyoid plate.      Section 19. The first, second, third, and fourth cranial nerves of the  frog correspond with those of the rabbit in origin and distribution. So  do five, six and eight. The seventh nerve forks over the ear-drum-- the  larger branch emerging behind it and running superficially, as shown  in Figure 4. There is also a deeper palatine branch of VII. (P.) running  under V2 and V3 below the orbit, and to be seen together with V1 and  V2 after removal of the eyeball. The ninth nerve similarly forks over the  first branchial slit of the tadpole, and evidence of the fork remains in  the frog. It is seen curving round anterior to the hypoglossal nerve, and  lying rather deeper in dissection. The vagus (tenth) nerve is distributed  to heart, lungs, and viscera-- in the tadpole it also sends for forking  branches over the second, third, and fourth branchial slits. It lies  deeper than IX., and internal to the veins, and runs close beside the  cutaneous artery. Most of these nerves are easily dissected and no  student should rest satisfied until he has actually seen them.      Section 20. The sympathetic chain is closely connected with the  aorta. It is, of course, paired, and is easily found in dissection by  lifting the dorsal aorta and looking at its mesentery. In the presence of  ganglia corresponding to the spinal nerves, and of rami  communicantes, it resembles that of the rabbit.      Section 21. The whole of this chapter is simply a concise  comparison, of frog and rabbit. In addition to reading it, the student  should very carefully follow the annotations to the figures, and should  copy and recopy these side by side with the corresponding diagrams  of the other types.        2. _The Skull of the Frog (and the vertebrate skull  generally)_    Section 22. We have already given a description of the mammalian  skull, and we have stated where the origin of the several bones was in  membrane, and where in cartilage; but a more complete  comprehension of the mammalian skull becomes possible with the  handling of a lower type. We propose now, first to give some short  account of the development and structure of the skull of the frog,  and then to show briefly how its development and adult arrangement  demonstrate the mammalian skull to be a fundamentally similar  structure, complicated and disguised by further development and  re-adjustment.      Section 23. Figure 1,I. Sheet 14, shows a dorsal view of a young  tadpole cranium; the brain has been removed, and it is seen that it  was supported simply upon two cartilaginous rods, the trabeculae  cranii (tr.c.). Behind these trabeculae comes the notochord (n.c.), and  around its anterior extremity is a paired tract of cartilage, the  parachordals (p.c.). These structures, underlying the skull, are all that  appear[s] at first of the brain box. In front, and separate from the  cranium, are the nasal organs (n.c.); the eyes lie laterally to the  trabeculae, and laterally to the parachordals are two tracts of cartilage  enclosing the internal ear, the otic capsules.      Section 24. Figure 1, II., is a more advanced, phase of the same  structures. The trabeculae have met in front and sent forward a  median (c.t.) and lateral parts (a.o.) to support the nasal organs. They  have also flattened, out very considerably, and have sent up walls on  either side of the brain to meet above it and form an incomplete roof  (t.) over it. The parachordals have similarly grown up round, the  hind-brain and formed a complete ring, the roof of which  is indicated, by b. Further, the otic capsules are fusing with the  brain-case. With certain differences of form these elements-- the  trabeculae, the parachordals, and the otic capsules, are also the first  formed structures of the mammalian cranium.      Section 25. In Figures 1,I. and II., there appears beneath the eye a  bar of cartilage (p.p.), the palato-pterygoid cartilage, which is also to  be seen from the side in Figures 8,I. and III. It will be learnt from these  latter that this bar is joined in front to the cranium behind the nasal  organ, and behind to the otic capsule. The cartilaginous bar from the  palato-pterygoid to the otic capsule is called the quadrate, and at the  point of junction, at the postero-ventral angle of the palato-pterygoid,  articulates with the cartilaginous bar which is destined to form the  substratum of the lower jaw-- Meckel's cartilage (M.c. in Figure 8,I.).      Section 26. Figure 2 shows a dorsal view of these structures in a  young frog. The parts corresponding to these in 1,II. will be easily  made out, but now ossification has set in at various points of this  cartilaginous cranium. In front of the otic capsule is the paired  pro-otic bone (p.o.); behind it at the sides of the parachordal ring is  the paired ex-occipital (e.o.); in front of the cranium box, and behind  the nasal capsules, is a ring of bone, the (median, but originally  paired) sphenethmoid (s.e.). -A paired ossification appears in the  palato-pterygoid cartilage the pterygoid bone (pt.), while- A splint of  bone, the quadrato-jugal, appears at the angle of articulation with the  lower jaw. These are all the cartilage bones that appear in the cranium  and upper jaw of the frog.      Section 27. But another series of bones, developed first chiefly in  dermal connective tissue, and coming to plate over the cranium of  cartilage, are not shown in Figure 2. They are, however, in Figure 3.  These membrane bones are: along the dorsal middle line, the  parieto-frontals (p.f.), originally two pairs of bones which fuse in  development, and the nasals (na.). Round the edge of the jaw, and  bearing the teeth, are pre-maxillae (p.m.), and maxillae (mx.), and  overlying the quadrate cartilage and lateral to the otic capsules are  the T-shaped squamosal bones (sq.). In the ventral view of the skull  (Figure 4) we see a pair of vomers (vo.) bearing teeth, a pair of  palatines (pal.), [and a pair of pterygoids (pt.)] (which [palatines and  pterygoids, we may note,] unlike those of the rabbit, are -stated to be-  membrane bones), and a great median dagger-shaped para-sphenoid  (p.sp.). These two Figures, and 5, which shows the same bones in  side view, should be carefully mastered before the student proceeds  with this chapter. The cartilage bones are distinguished from  membrane bones by cross-shading.      Section 28. Turning now to Figure 8,I., we have a side view of a  tadpole's skull. On the ventral side of the head is a series of vertical  cartilaginous bars, the visceral arches supporting the walls of the  tadpole's gill slits. The first of these is called the hyoid arch (c.h.),  and the four following this, the first (br.1), second, third, and fourth  (br.4), branchial arches. Altogether there are four gill slits and between  the hyoid arch and the jaw arch, as it is called (= Meckel's cartilage +  the palato-pterygoid), is \"an imperforate slit,\" which becomes the  ear-drum.* The frog no longer breathes by gills, but by lungs, and the  gills are lost, the gill slits closed, and the branchial arches  consequently much reduced. Figures 8, II., and 8, III., show stages in  this reduction. The hyoid arch becomes attached, to the otic capsule,  and its median ventral "]]]
