Stephen Norman was plucky, and when she was face to face with any  difficulty she was all herself.  Leonard did not look pleasant; his face  was hard and there was just a suspicion of anger.  Strangely enough, this  last made the next step easier to the girl; she said slowly:    'All right!  I think I understand!'    He turned from her and stood looking out on the distant prospect.  Then  she felt that the blow which she had all along secretly feared had fallen  on her.  But her pride as well as her obstinacy now rebelled.  She would  not accept a silent answer.  There must be no doubt left to torture her  afterwards.  She would take care that there was no mistake.  Schooling  herself to her task, and pressing one hand for a moment to her side as  though to repress the beating of her heart, she came behind him and  touched him tenderly on the arm.    'Leonard,' she said softly, 'are you sure there is no mistake?  Do you  not see that I am asking you,' she intended to say 'to be my husband,'  but she could not utter the words, they seemed to stick in her mouth, so  she finished the sentence: 'that I be your wife?'    The moment the words were spoken--the bare, hard, naked, shameless  words--the revulsion came.  As a lightning flash shows up the blackness  of the night the appalling truth of what she had done was forced upon  her.  The blood rushed to her head till cheeks and shoulders and neck  seemed to burn.  Covering her face with her hands she sank back on the  seat crying silently bitter tears that seemed to scald her eyes and her  cheeks as they ran.    Leonard was angry.  When it began to dawn upon him what was the purpose  of Stephen's speech, he had been shocked.  Young men are so easily  shocked by breaches of convention made by women they respect!  And his  pride was hurt.  Why should he have been placed in such a ridiculous  position!  He did not love Stephen in that way; and she should have known  it.  He liked her and all that sort of thing; but what right had she to  assume that he loved her?  All the weakness of his moral nature came out  in his petulance.  It was boyish that his eyes filled with tears.  He  knew it, and that made him more angry than ever.  Stephen might well have  been at a loss to understand his anger, as, with manifest intention to  wound, he answered her:    'What a girl you are, Stephen.  You are always doing something or other  to put a chap in the wrong and make him ridiculous.  I thought you were  joking--not a good joke either!  Upon my soul, I don't know what I've  done that you should fix on me!  I wish to goodness--'    If Stephen had suffered the red terror before, she suffered the white  terror now.  It was not injured pride, it was not humiliation, it was not  fear; it was something vague and terrible that lay far deeper than any of  these.  Under ordinary circumstances she would have liked to have spoken  out her mind and given back as good as she got; and even as the thoughts  whirled through her brain they came in a torrent of vague vituperative  eloquence.  But now her tongue was tied.  Instinctively she knew that she  had put it out of her power to revenge, or even to defend herself.  She  was tied to the stake, and must suffer without effort and in silence.    Most humiliating of all was the thought that she must propitiate the man  who had so wounded her.  All love for him had in the instant passed from  her; or rather she realised fully the blank, bare truth that she had  never really loved him at all.  Had she really loved him, even a blow at  his hands would have been acceptable; but now . . .    She shook the feelings and thoughts from her as a bird does the water  from its wings; and, with the courage and strength and adaptability of  her nature, addressed herself to the hard task which faced her in the  immediate present.  With eloquent, womanly gesture she arrested the  torrent of Leonard's indignation; and, as he paused in surprised  obedience, she said:    'That will do, Leonard!  It is not necessary to say any more; and I am  sure you will see, later on, that at least there was no cause for your  indignation!  I have done an unconventional thing, I know; and I dare say  I shall have to pay for it in humiliating bitterness of thought later on!  But please remember we are all alone!  This is a secret between us; no  one else need ever know or suspect it!'    She rose as she concluded.  The quiet dignity of her speech and bearing  brought back Leonard in some way to his sense of duty as a gentleman.  He  began, in a sheepish way, to make an apology:    'I'm sure I beg your pardon, Stephen.'  But again she held the warning  hand:    'There is no need for pardon; the fault, if there were any, was mine  alone.  It was I, remember, who asked you to come here and who introduced  and conducted this melancholy business.  I have asked you several things,  Leonard, and one more I will add--'tis only one: that you will forget!'    As she moved away, her dismissal of the subject was that of an empress to  a serf.  Leonard would have liked to answer her; to have given vent to  his indignation that, even when he had refused her offer, she should have  the power to treat him if he was the one refused, and to make him feel  small and ridiculous in his own eyes.  But somehow he felt constrained to  silence; her simple dignity outclassed him.    There was another factor too, in his forming his conclusion of silence.  He had never seen Stephen look so well, or so attractive.  He had never  respected her so much as when her playfulness had turned to majestic  gravity.  All the boy and girl strife of the years that had gone seemed  to have passed away.  The girl whom he had played with, and bullied, and  treated as frankly as though she had been a boy, had in an instant become  a woman--and such a woman as demanded respect and admiration even from  such a man.          CHAPTER XII--ON THE ROAD HOME      When Leonard Everard parted from Stephen he did so with a feeling of  dissatisfaction: firstly, with Stephen; secondly, with things in general;  thirdly, with himself.  The first was definite, concrete, and immediate;  he could give himself chapter and verse for all the girl's misdoing.  Everything she had said or done had touched some nerve painfully, or had  offended his feelings; and to a man of his temperament his feelings are  very sacred things, to himself.    'Why had she put him in such a ridiculous position?  That was the worst  of women.  They were always wanting him to do something he didn't want to  do, or crying . . . there was that girl at Oxford.'    Here he turned his head slowly, and looked round in a furtive way, which  was getting almost a habit with him.  'A fellow should go away so that he  wouldn't have to swear lies.  Women were always wanting money; or worse:  to be married!  Confound women; they all seemed to want him to marry  them!  There was the Oxford girl, and then the Spaniard, and now  Stephen!'  This put his thoughts in a new channel.  He wanted money  himself.  Why, Stephen had spoken of it herself; had offered to pay his  debts.  Gad! it was a good idea that every one round the countryside  seemed to know his affairs.  What a flat he had been not to accept her  offer then and there before matters had gone further.  Stephen had lots  of money, more than any girl could want.  But she didn't give him time to  get the thing fixed . . . If he had only known beforehand what she wanted  he could have come prepared . . . that was the way with women!  Always  thinking of themselves!  And now?  Of course she wouldn't stump up after  his refusing her.  What would his father say if he came to hear of it?  And he must speak to him soon, for these chaps were threatening to County  Court him if he didn't pay.  Those harpies in Vere Street were quite  nasty . . . '  He wondered if he could work Stephen for a loan.    He walked on through the woodland path, his pace slower than before.  'How  pretty she had looked!'  Here he touched his little moustache.  'Gad!  Stephen was a fine girl anyhow!  If it wasn't for all that red hair . . .  I like 'em dark better! . . . And her being such an infernal boss!'. . .  Then he said unconsciously aloud:    'If I was her husband I'd keep her to rights!'    Poor Stephen!    'So that's what the governor meant by telling me that fortune was to be  had, and had easily, if a man wasn't a blind fool.  The governor is a  starchy old party.  He wouldn't speak out straight and say, \"Here's  Stephen Norman, the richest girl you are ever likely to meet; why don't  you make up to her and marry her?\"  But that would be encouraging his son  to be a fortune-hunter!  Rot! . . . And now, just because she didn't tell  me what she wanted to speak about, or the governor didn't give me a hint  so that I might be prepared, I have gone and thrown away the chance.  After all it mightn't be so bad.  Stephen is a fine girl! . . . But she  mustn't ever look at me as she did when I spoke about her not obeying.  I  mean to be master in my own house anyhow!    'A man mustn't be tied down too tight, even if he is married.  And if  there's plenty of loose cash about it isn't hard to cover up your tracks  . . . I think I'd better think this thing over calmly and be ready when  Stephen comes at me again.  That's the way with women.  When a woman like  Stephen fixes her cold grey on a man she does not mean to go asleep over  it.  I daresay my best plan will be to sit tight, and let her work  herself up a bit.  There's nothing like a little wholesome neglect for  bringing a girl to her bearings!' . . .    For a while he walked on in satisfied self-complacency.    'Confound her! why couldn't she have let me know that she was fond of me  in some decent way, without all that formal theatrical proposing?  It's a  deuced"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2526"],[0,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man (#17)"],[1,"no wise different from states of mind. The  same thought has occurred, and still occurs, to all philosophers; and,  by various reasonings, they all come to the same wise conclusion; that  the material world is not made by the mood of any human mind, but  is rather the manifestation of the totality of invisible Being, whether  we call this Mahat, with the ancients, or Ether, with the moderns.    16. Nor do material objects depend upon a single mind, for how could  they remain objective to others, if that mind ceased to think of them?    This is but a further development of the thought of the preceding  Sutra, carrying on the thought that, while the universe is spiritual, yet  its material expression is ordered, consistent, ruled by law, not subject  to the whims or affirmations of a single mind. Unwelcome material  things may be escaped by spiritual growth, by rising to a realm above  them, and not by denying their existence on their own plane. So that  our system is neither materialistic, nor idealistic in the extreme sense,  but rather intuitional and spiritual, holding that matter is the  manifestation of spirit as a whole, a reflection or externalization of  spirit, and, like spirit, everywhere obedient to law. The path of  liberation is not through denial of matter but through denial of the  wills of self, through obedience, and that aspiration which builds the  vesture of the spiritual man.    17. An object is perceived, or not perceived, according as the mind is,  or is not, tinged with the colour of the object.    The simplest manifestation of this is the matter of attention. Our minds  apprehend what they wish to apprehend; all else passes unnoticed, or,  on the other hand, we perceive what we resent, as, for example, the  noise of a passing train; while others, used to the sound, do not notice  it at all.    But the deeper meaning is, that out of the vast totality of objects ever  present in the universe, the mind perceives only those which conform  to the hue of its Karma. The rest remain unseen, even though close at  hand.    This spiritual law has been well expressed by Emerson:    \"Through solidest eternal things the man finds his road as if they did  not subsist, and does not once suspect their being. As soon as he  needs a new object, suddenly he beholds it, and no longer attempts to  pass through it, but takes another way. When he has exhausted for the  time the nourishment to be drawn from any one person or thing, that  object is withdrawn from his observation, and though still in his  immediate neighbourhood, he does not suspect its presence. Nothing  is dead. Men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals and  mournful obituaries, and there they stand looking out of the window,  sound and well, in some new and strange disguise. Jesus is not dead,  he is very well alive: nor John, nor Paul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle;  at times we believe we have seen them all, and could easily tell the  names under which they go.\"    18. The movements of the psychic nature are perpetually objects of  perception, since the Spiritual Man, who is the lord of them, remains  unchanging.    Here is teaching of the utmost import, both for understanding and for  practice.    To the psychic nature belong all the ebb and flow of emotion, all  hoping and fearing, desire and hate: the things that make the multitude  of men and women deem themselves happy or miserable. To it also  belong the measuring and comparing, the doubt and questioning,  which, for the same multitude, make up mental life. So that there  results the emotion-soaked personality, with its dark and narrow view  of life: the shivering, terror driven personality that is life itself  for all but all of mankind.    Yet the personality is not the true man, not the living soul at all, but  only a spectacle which the true man observes. Let us under stand this,  therefore, and draw ourselves up inwardly to the height of the  Spiritual Man, who, standing in the quiet light of the Eternal, looks  down serene upon this turmoil of the outer life.    One first masters the personality, the \"mind,\" by thus looking down on  it from above, from within; by steadily watching its ebb and flow, as  objective, outward, and therefore not the real Self. This standing back  is the first step, detachment. The second, to maintain the  vantage-ground thus gained, is recollection.    19. The Mind is not self-luminous, since it can be seen as an object.    This is a further step toward overthrowing the tyranny of the \"mind\":  the psychic nature of emotion and mental measuring. This psychic self,  the personality, claims to be absolute, asserting that life is for it and  through it; it seeks to impose on the whole being of man its narrow,  materialistic, faithless view of life and the universe; it would clip the  wings of the soaring Soul. But the Soul dethrones the tyrant, by  perceiving and steadily affirming that the psychic self is no true self at  all, not self-luminous, but only an object of observation, watched by  the serene eyes of the Spiritual Man.    20. Nor could the Mind at the same time know itself and things  external to it.    The truth is that the \"mind\" knows neither external things nor itself.  Its measuring and analyzing, its hoping and fearing, hating and  desiring, never give it a true measure of life, nor any sense of real  values. Ceaselessly active, it never really attains to knowledge; or, if  we admit its knowledge, it ever falls short of wisdom, which comes  only through intuition, the vision of the Spiritual Man.    Life cannot be known by the \"mind,\" its secrets cannot be learned  through the \"mind.\" The proof is, the ceaseless strife and contradiction  of opinion among those who trust in the mind. Much less can the  \"mind\" know itself, the more so, because it is pervaded by the illusion  that it truly knows, truly is.    True knowledge of the \"mind\" comes, first, when the Spiritual Man,  arising, stands detached, regarding the \"mind\" from above, with quiet  eyes, and seeing it for the tangled web of psychic forces that it truly  is. But the truth is divined long before it is clearly seen, and then  begins the long battle of the \"mind,\" against the Real, the \"mind\"  fighting doggedly, craftily, for its supremacy.    21. If the Mind be thought of as seen by another more inward Mind,  then there would be an endless series of perceiving Minds, and a  confusion of memories.    One of the expedients by which the \"mind\" seeks to deny and thwart  the Soul, when it feels that it is beginning to be circumvented and seen  through, is to assert that this seeing is the work of a part of itself, one  part observing the other, and thus leaving no need nor place for the  Spiritual Man.    To this strategy the argument is opposed by our philosopher, that this  would be no true solution, but only a postponement of the solution.  For we should have to find yet another part of the mind to view the  first observing part, and then another to observe this, and so on,  endlessly.    The true solution is, that the Spiritual Man looks down upon the  psychic nature, and observes it; when he views the psychic pictures  gallery, this is \"memory,\" which would be a hopeless, inextricable  confusion, if we thought of one part of the \"mind,\" with its memories,  viewing another part, with memories of its own.    The solution of the mystery lies not in the \"mind\" but beyond it, in the  luminous life of the risen Lord, the Spiritual Man.    22. When the psychical nature takes on the form of the spiritual  intelligence, by reflecting it, then the Self becomes conscious of its  own spiritual intelligence.    We are considering a stage of spiritual life at which the psychical  nature has been cleansed and purified. Formerly, it reflected in its  plastic substance the images of the earthy; purified now, it reflects the  image of the heavenly, giving the spiritual intelligence a visible form.  The Self, beholding that visible form, in which its spiritual intelligence  has, as it were, taken palpable shape, thereby reaches self-recognition,  self-comprehension. The Self sees itself in this mirror, and thus  becomes not only conscious, but self-conscious. This is, from one  point of view, the purpose of the whole evolutionary process.    23. The psychic nature, taking on the colour of the Seer and of things  seen, leads to the perception of all objects.    In the unregenerate man, the psychic nature is saturated with images  of material things, of things seen, or heard, or tasted, or felt; and this  web of dynamic images forms the ordinary material and driving power  of life. The sensation of sweet things tasted clamours to be renewed,  and drives the man into effort to obtain its renewal; so he adds image  to image, each dynamic and importunate, piling up sin's intolerable  burden.    Then comes regeneration, and the washing away of sin, through the  fiery, creative power of the Soul, which burns out the stains of the  psychic vesture, purifying it as gold is refined in the furnace. The  suffering of regeneration springs from this indispensable purifying.    Then the psychic vesture begins to take on the colour of the Soul, no  longer stained, but suffused with golden light; and the man red  generate gleams with the radiance of eternity. Thus the Spiritual Man  puts on fair raiment; for of this cleansing it is said: Though your sins  be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be as crimson,  they shall be as wool.    24. The psychic nature, which has been printed with mind-images of  innumerable material things, exists now for the Spiritual Man,  building for him.    The \"mind,\" once the tyrant, is now the slave, recognized as outward,  separate, not Self, a well-trained instrument of the Spiritual Man.    For it is not ordained for the Spiritual Man that, finding his high realm,  he shall enter altogether there, and pass out of the vision of mankind.  It is true that he"]]]
