About a month later  I was surprised to see ten or twelve ears of English barley that had  sprung up and several stalks of rice.  You may be sure I saved the seed,  hoping that in time I might have enough grain to supply me with bread.  It was not until the fourth season that I could allow myself the least  particle to eat, and none of it was ever wasted.  From this handful,  I had in time all the rice and barley I needed for food,---above forty  bushels of each in a year, as I might guess, for I had no measure.    23.  I may mention that I took from the ship two cats; and the ship's  dog which I found there was so overjoyed to see me that he swam  ashore with me.  These were much comfort to me.  But one of the cats  disappeared and I thought she was dead.  I heard no more of her till she  came home with three kittens.  In the end I was so overrun with cats  that I had to shoot some, when most of the remainder disappeared in the  woods and did not trouble me any more.    Questions and Notes.

I had a cold fit and then  a hot one, with faint sweats after it.  My body ached all over,  and I had violent pains in my head.  The next day I felt much better,  but had dreadful fears of sickness, since I remembered that I was alone,  and had no medicines, and not even any food or drink in the house.  The following day I had a terrible headache with my chills and fever;  but the day after that I was better again, and went out with my gun and  shot a she-goat; yet I found myself very weak.  After some days,  in which I learned to pray to God for the first time after eight years  of wicked seafaring life, I made a sort of medicine _by_ steeping  tobacco leaf in rum.  I took a large dose of this several times a day.  In the course of a week or two I got well; but for some time after I was  very pale, and my muscles were weak and flabby.    25.  After I had discovered the various kinds of fruit which grew on the  other side of the island, especially the grapes which I dried for  raisins, my meals were as follows: I ate a bunch of raisins for my  breakfast; for dinner a piece of goat's flesh or of turtle broiled;  and two or three turtle's eggs for supper.  As yet I had nothing in  which I could boil or stew anything.  When my grain was grown I had  nothing with which to mow or reap it, nothing with which to  thresh it or separate it from the chaff, no mill to grind it,  no sieve to clean it, no yeast or salt to make it into bread,  and no oven in which to bake it.  I did not even have a water-pail.  Yet all these things I did without.  In time I contrived earthen  vessels which were very useful, though rather rough and coarse;  and I built a hearth which I made to answer for an oven.    Questions and Notes.

XII.    26.  You would have smiled to see me sit down to dinner with my family.  There was my parrot, which I had taught to speak.  My dog was grown very  old and crazy; but he sat at my right hand.  Then there were my two  cats, one on one side of the table and one on the other.  Besides these, I had a tame kid or two always about the house, and  several sea-fowls whose wings I had clipped.  These were my subjects.  In their society I felt myself a king.  I was lord of all the land  about, as far as my eye could reach.  I had a broad and wealthy domain.  Here I reigned sole master for twenty-five years.  Only once did I try  to leave my island in a boat; and then I came near being carried out  into the ocean forever by an ocean current I had not noticed before.    27.  When I had been on the island twenty-three years I was greatly  frightened to see a footprint in the sand.  For two years after I saw no  human being; but then a large company of savages appeared in canoes.  When they had landed they built a fire and danced about it.  Presently they seemed about to make a feast on two captives they had  brought with them.  By chance, however, one of them escaped.  Two of the band followed him; but he was a swifter runner  than they.  Now, I thought, is my chance to get a servant.  So I ran down the hill, and with the butt of my musket knocked down one  of the two pursuers.  When I saw the other about to draw his bow.  I was obliged to shoot him.  The man I had saved seemed at first as  frightened at me as were his pursuers.  But I beckoned him to come to  me and gave him all the signs of encouragement I could think of.    28.  He was a handsome fellow, with straight, strong limbs.  He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly appearance.  His hair was long and black, not curled like wool; his forehead was very  high and large; and the color of his skin was not quite black, but  tawny.  His face was round and plump; his nose small, not flat like that  of negroes; and he had fine teeth, well set, and as white as ivory.    29.  Never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday  was to me (for so I called him from the day on which I had saved his  life).  I was greatly delighted with him and made it my business to  teach him everything that was proper to make him useful, handy,  and helpful.  He was the aptest scholar that ever was, and so merry,  and so pleased when he could but understand me, that it was very  pleasant to me to talk to him.  Now my life began to be so easy,  that I said to myself, that could I but feel safe from more savages,  I cared not if I were never to remove from the place where I lived.    (Friday was more like a son than a servant to Crusoe.  Here was one  being who could under-stand human speech, who could learn the difference  between right and wrong, who could be neighbor, friend, and companion.  Crusoe had often read from his Bible; but now he might teach this  heathen also to read from it the truth of life.  Friday proved a good  boy, and never got into mischief.)    Questions and Notes.

The Sir Roger de Coverley Papers--Steele and Addison.          THE FAMILY HOLDS ITS HEAD UP           The story is an extract from Oliver Goldsmith's famous novel, _The       Vicar of Wakefield_. In this book Goldsmith describes the fortunes       of the family of Doctor Primrose, a Church of England clergyman of       the middle of the eighteenth century. The novel is considered a       most faithful picture of English country life in that period.    The home I had come to as [v]vicar was in a little neighborhood  consisting of farmers who tilled their own grounds and were equal  strangers to [v]opulence and poverty. As they had almost all the  conveniences of life within themselves, they seldom visited towns or  cities in search of [v]superfluity. Remote from the polite, they still  retained the [v]primeval simplicity of manners; and, frugal by habit,  they scarce knew that temperance was a virtue. They wrought with  cheerfulness on days of labor, but observed festivals as intervals of  idleness and pleasure. They kept up the Christmas carol, sent love-knots  on Valentine morning, ate pancakes on [v]Shrovetide, showed their wit on  the first of April, and religiously cracked nuts on [v]Michaelmas-eve.  Being apprised of our approach, the whole neighborhood came out to meet  their minister, dressed in their finest clothes and preceded by a  [v]pipe and [v]tabor: a feast, also, was provided for our reception, at  which we sat cheerfully down, and what the conversation wanted in wit  was made up in laughter.    Our little habitation was situated at the foot of a sloping hill,  sheltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a prattling river  before; on one side a meadow, on the other a green. My farm consisted of  about twenty acres of excellent land. Nothing could exceed the neatness  of my little enclosures, the elms and hedgerows appearing with  inexpressible beauty. My house consisted of but one story, and was  covered with [v]thatch, which gave it an air of great snugness; the  walls on the inside were nicely whitewashed, and my daughters undertook  to adorn them with pictures of their own designing. Though the same room  served us for parlor and kitchen, that only made it the warmer. Besides,  as it was kept with the utmost neatness,--the dishes, plates and coppers  being well scoured and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves--the  eye was agreeably relieved and did not want richer furniture. There were  three other apartments: one for my wife and me; another for our two  daughters within our own; and the third, with two beds, for the rest of  the children.    The little republic to which I gave laws was regulated in the following  manner: by sunrise we all assembled in our common apartment, the fire  being previously kindled by the servant. After we had saluted each other  with proper ceremony--for I always thought fit to keep up some  mechanical forms of good breeding, without which freedom ever destroys  friendship--we all bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another  day. This duty performed, my son and I went to pursue our usual industry  abroad, while my wife and daughters employed themselves in providing  breakfast, which was always ready at a certain time. I allowed half an  hour for this meal, and an hour for dinner, which time was taken up in  innocent mirth between my wife and daughters, and in [v]philosophical  arguments between my son and me.    As we rose with the sun, so we never pursued our labors after it was  gone down, but returned home to the expecting family, where smiling  looks, a neat hearth, and a pleasant fire were prepared for our  reception. Nor were we without guests; sometimes Farmer Flamborough, our  talkative neighbor, and often a blind piper, would pay us a visit and  taste our gooseberry wine, for the making of which we had lost neither  the recipe nor the reputation. These harmless people had several ways of  being good company; while one played, the other would sing some soothing  ballad--\"Johnny Armstrong's Last Good-Night,\" or \"The Cruelty of Barbara  Allen.\" The night was concluded in the manner we began the morning, my  youngest boys being appointed to read the lessons of the day; and he  that read loudest, distinctest and best was to have an halfpenny on  Sunday to put into the poor-box. This encouraged in them a wholesome  rivalry to do good.    When Sunday came, it was, indeed, a day of finery, which all my  [v]sumptuary edicts could not restrain. How well soever I fancied my  lectures against pride had conquered the vanity of my daughters, yet I  still found them secretly attached to all their former finery; they  still loved laces, ribbons, and bugles, and my wife herself retained a  passion for her crimson [v]paduasoy, because I formerly happened to say  it became her.    The first Sunday, in particular, their behavior served to mortify me. I  had desired my girls the preceding night to be dressed early the next  day, for I always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of  the congregation. They punctually obeyed my directions; but when we were  to assemble in the morning at breakfast, down came my wife and  daughters, dressed out in all their former splendor--their hair  plastered up with [v]pomatum, their faces [v]patched to taste, their  trains bundled up in a heap behind and rustling at every motion. I could  not help smiling at their vanity, particularly that of my wife, from  whom I expected more discretion. In this [v]exigence, therefore, my only  resource was to order my son, with an important air, to call our coach.  The girls were amazed at the command, but I repeated it, with more  solemnity than before.    \"Surely, you jest!\" cried my wife. \"We can walk perfectly well; we want  no coach to carry us now.\"    \"You mistake, child,\" returned I; \"we do want a coach, for if we walk  to church in this trim, the very children in the parish will hoot after  us.\"    \"Indeed!\" replied my wife. \"I always imagined that my Charles was fond  of seeing his children neat and handsome about him.\"    \"You may be as neat as you please,\" interrupted I, \"and I shall love you  the better for it; but all this is not neatness, but frippery. These  rufflings and pinkings and patchings will only make us hated by all the  wives of our neighbors. No, my children,\" continued I, more gravely,  \"those gowns must be altered into something of a plainer cut, for finery  is very unbecoming in us who want the means of [v]decency.\"    This remonstrance had the proper effect. They went with great composure,  that very instant, to change their dress; and the next day I had the  satisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own request, employed in  cutting up their trains into Sunday waist-coats for Dick and Bill, the  two little ones; and, what was still more satisfactory, the gowns seemed  improved by this [v]curtailing.    But the reformation lasted but for a short while. My wife and daughters  were visited by the wives of some of the richer neighbors and by a  squire who lived near by, on whom they set more store than on the plain  farmers' wives who were nearer us in worldly station. I now began to  find that all my long and painful lectures upon temperance, simplicity,  and contentment were entirely disregarded. Some distinctions lately  paid us by our betters awakened that pride which I had laid asleep, but  not removed. Our windows again, as formerly, were filled with washes for  the neck and face. The sun was dreaded as an enemy to the skin without  doors and the fire as a spoiler of the complexion within. My wife  observed that rising too early would hurt her daughters' eyes, that  working after dinner would redden their noses, and she convinced me that  the hands never looked so white as when they did nothing.    Instead, therefore, of finishing George's shirts, we now had the girls  new-modeling their old gauzes. The poor Miss Flamboroughs, their former  gay companions, were cast off as mean acquaintance, and the"]]]
