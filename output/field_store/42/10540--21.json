By the time the spore    fruit (for this structure corresponds to the spore fruit of the    _Ascomycetes_) reaches a height of two or three millimetres, and is    plainly visible to the naked eye, the cap grows downward at the    margins, so as to almost entirely conceal the stalk. A longitudinal    section of such a stage shows the stalk to be composed of a    small-celled, close tissue becoming looser in the cap, on whose    inner surface the spore-bearing ridges (\"gills\" or _Lamellae_) have    begun to develop. Some of these run completely to the edge of the    cap, others only part way. To study their structure, make    cross-sections of the cap of a nearly full-grown, but unopened,    specimen, and this will give numerous sections of the young gills.    We find them to be flat plates, composed within of loosely    interwoven filaments, whose ends stand out at right angles to the    surface of the gills, forming a layer of closely-set upright cells    (basidia) (Fig. 48, _D_). These are at first all alike, but later    some of them become club-shaped, and develop at the end several    (usually four) little points, at the end of which spores are formed    in exactly the same way as we saw in the germinating teleuto spores    of the cedar rust, all the protoplasm of the basidium passing into    the growing spores (Fig. 48, _E_, _F_). The ripe spores (_E_, _sp._)    are oval, and possess a firm, dark outer wall. Occasionally some of    the basidia develop into very large sterile cells (E, _x_),    projecting far beyond the others, and often reaching the neighboring    gill.    Similar in structure and development to _Coprinus_ are all the large  and common forms; but they differ much in the position of the  spore-bearing tissue, as well as in the form and size of the whole  spore fruit. They are sometimes divided, according to the position of  the spores, into three orders: the closed-fruited (_Angiocarpous_)  forms, the half-closed (_Hemi-angiocarpous_), and the open or  naked-fruited forms (_Gymnocarpous_).    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--_Basidiomycetes_. _A_, common puff-ball  (_Lycoperdon_). _B_, earth star (_Geaster_). _A_, x 1/4. _B_, one-half  natural size.]    Of the first, the puff-balls (Fig. 49) are common examples. One  species, the giant puff-ball (_Lycoperdon giganteum_), often reaches a  diameter of thirty to forty centimetres. The earth stars (_Geaster_)  have a double covering to the spore fruit, the outer one splitting at  maturity into strips (Fig. 49, _B_). Another pretty and common form is  the little birds'-nest fungus (_Cyathus_), growing on rotten wood or  soil containing much decaying vegetable matter (Fig. 50).    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Birds'-nest fungus (_Cyathus_). _A_, young.  _B_, full grown. _C_, section through _B_, showing the \"sporangia\"  (_sp._). All twice the natural size.]    In the second order the spores are at first protected, as we have seen  in _Coprinus_, which belongs to this order, but finally become  exposed. Here belong the toadstools and mushrooms (Fig. 51, _B_), the  large shelf-shaped fungi (_Polyporus_), so common on tree trunks and  rotten logs (Fig. 51, _C_, _D_, _E_), and the prickly fungus  (_Hydnum_) (Fig. 51, _G_).    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Forms of _Basidiomycetes_. _A_, _Tremella_,  one-half natural size. _B_, _Agaricus_, natural size. _C_, _E_,  _Polyporus_: _C_, x 1/2; _E_, x 1/4. _D_, part of the under surface of  _D_, natural size. _F_, _Clavaria_, a small piece, natural size. _G_,  _Hydnum_, a piece of the natural size.]    Of the last, or naked-fruited forms, the commonest belong to the  genus _Clavaria_ (Fig. 51, _F_), smooth-branching forms, usually of a  brownish color, bearing the spores directly upon the surface of the  branches.          CHAPTER XI.    SUB-KINGDOM IV.    BRYOPHYTA.      The Bryophytes, or mosses, are for the most part land plants, though a  few are aquatic, and with very few exceptions are richly supplied with  chlorophyll. They are for the most part small plants, few of them  being over a few centimetres in height; but, nevertheless, compared  with the plants that we have heretofore studied, quite complex in  their structure. The lowest members of the group are flattened,  creeping plants, or a few of them floating aquatics, without distinct  stem and leaves; but the higher ones have a pretty well-developed  central axis or stem, with simple leaves attached.    There are two classes--I. Liverworts (_Hepaticae_), and II. Mosses  (_Musci_).      CLASS I.--THE LIVERWORTS.    One of the commonest of this class, and to be had at any time, is  named _Madotheca_. It is one of the highest of the class, having  distinct stem and leaves. It grows most commonly on the shady side of  tree trunks, being most luxuriant near the ground, where the supply of  moisture is most constant. It also occurs on stones and rocks in moist  places. It closely resembles a true moss in general appearance, and  from the scale-like arrangement of its leaves is sometimes called  \"scale moss.\"    The leaves (Fig. 52, _A_, _B_) are rounded in outline unequally,  two-lobed, and arranged in two rows on the upper side of the stem, so  closely overlapping as to conceal it entirely. On the under side are  similar but smaller leaves, less regularly disposed. The stems branch  at intervals, the branches spreading out laterally so that the whole  plant is decidedly flattened. On the under side are fine, whitish  hairs, that fasten it to the substratum. If we examine a number of  specimens, especially early in the spring, a difference will be  observed in the plants. Some of them will be found to bear peculiar  structures (Fig. 52, _C_, _D_), in which the spores are produced.  These are called \"sporogonia.\" They are at first globular, but when  ripe open by means of four valves, and discharge a greenish brown mass  of spores. An examination of the younger parts of the same plants will  probably show small buds (Fig. 54, _H_), which contain the female  reproductive organs, from which the sporogonia arise.    [Illustration: FIG. 52.--_A_, part of a plant of a leafy liverwort  (_Madotheca_), x 2. _B_, part of the same, seen from below, x 4. _C_,  a branch with two open sporogonia (_sp._), x 4. _D_, a single  sporogonium, x 8.]    On other plants may be found numerous short side branches (Fig. 53,  _B_), with very closely set leaves. If these are carefully separated,  the antheridia can just be seen as minute whitish globules, barely  visible to the naked eye. Plants that, like this one, have the male  and female reproductive organs on distinct plants, are said to be  \"dioecious.\"      A microscopical examination of the stem and leaves shows their    structure to be very simple. The former is cylindrical, and composed    of nearly uniform elongated cells, with straight cross-walls. The    leaves consist of a single layer of small, roundish cells, which,    like those of the stem, contain numerous rounded chloroplasts, to    which is due their dark green color.      The tissues are developed from a single apical cell, but it is    difficult to obtain good sections through it.      The antheridia are borne singly at the bases of the leaves on the    special branches already described (Fig. 53, _A_, _an._). By    carefully dissecting with needles such a branch in a drop of water,    some of the antheridia will usually be detached uninjured, and may    be readily studied, the full-grown ones being just large enough to    be seen with the naked eye. They are globular bodies, attached by a    stalk composed of two rows of cells. The globular portion consists    of a wall of chlorophyll-bearing cells, composed of two layers    below, but single above (Fig. 53, _C_). Within is a mass of    excessively small cells, each of which contains a spermatozoid. In    the young antheridium (_A_, _an._) the wall is single throughout,    and the central cells few in number. To study them in their natural    position, thin longitudinal sections of the antheridial branch    should be made.    [Illustration: FIG. 53.--_A_, end of a branch from a male plant of  _Madotheca_. The small side branchlets bear the antheridia, x 2. _B_,  two young antheridia (_an._), the upper one seen in optical section,  the lower one from without, x 150. _C_, a ripe antheridium, optical  section, x 50. _D_, sperm cells with young spermatozoids. _E_, ripe  spermatozoids, x 600.]      When ripe, if brought into water, the antheridium bursts at the top    into a number of irregular lobes that curl back and allow the mass    of sperm cells to escape. The spermatozoids, which are derived    principally from the nucleus of the sperm cells (53, _D_) are so    small as to make a satisfactory examination possible only with very    powerful lenses. The ripe spermatozoid is coiled in a flat spiral    (53, _E_), and has two excessively delicate cilia, visible only    under the most favorable circumstances.      The female organ in the bryophytes is called an \"archegonium,\" and    differs considerably from anything we have yet studied, but recalls    somewhat the structure of the ooegonium of _Chara_. They are found in    groups, contained in little bud-like branches (54, _H_). In order to    study them, a plant should be chosen that has numbers of such buds,    and the smallest that can be found should be used. Those containing    the young archegonia are very small; but after one has been    fertilized, the leaves enclosing it grow much larger, and the bud    becomes quite conspicuous, being surrounded by two or three    comparatively large leaves. By dissecting the young buds, archegonia    in all stages of growth may be found.

I now pass to what is the main subject of these latter confessions, to  the history and journal of what took place in my dreams, for these were  the immediate and proximate cause of my acutest suffering.    The first notice I had of any important change going on in this part of  my physical economy was from the reawakening of a state of eye generally  incident to childhood, or exalted states of irritability.  I know not  whether my reader is aware that many children, perhaps most, have a power  of painting, as it were upon the darkness, all sorts of phantoms.  In  some that power is simply a mechanical affection of the eye; others have  a voluntary or semi-voluntary power to dismiss or to summon them; or, as  a child once said to me when I questioned him on this matter, \"I can tell  them to go, and they go ---, but sometimes they come when I don't tell  them to come.\"  Whereupon I told him that he had almost as unlimited a  command over apparitions as a Roman centurion over his soldiers.--In the  middle of 1817, I think it was, that this faculty became positively  distressing to me: at night, when I lay awake in bed, vast processions  passed along in mournful pomp; friezes of never-ending stories, that to  my feelings were as sad and solemn as if they were stories drawn from  times before OEdipus or Priam, before Tyre, before Memphis.  And at the  same time a corresponding change took place in my dreams; a theatre  seemed suddenly opened and lighted up within my brain, which presented  nightly spectacles of more than earthly splendour.  And the four  following facts may be mentioned as noticeable at this time:    1.  That as the creative state of the eye increased, a sympathy seemed to  arise between the waking and the dreaming states of the brain in one  point--that whatsoever I happened to call up and to trace by a voluntary  act upon the darkness was very apt to transfer itself to my dreams, so  that I feared to exercise this faculty; for, as Midas turned all things  to gold that yet baffled his hopes and defrauded his human desires, so  whatsoever things capable of being visually represented I did but think  of in the darkness, immediately shaped themselves into phantoms of the  eye; and by a process apparently no less inevitable, when thus once  traced in faint and visionary colours, like writings in sympathetic ink,  they were drawn out by the fierce chemistry of my dreams into  insufferable splendour that fretted my heart.    2.  For this and all other changes in my dreams were accompanied by deep-  seated anxiety and gloomy melancholy, such as are wholly incommunicable  by words.  I seemed every night to descend, not metaphorically, but  literally to descend, into chasms and sunless abysses, depths below  depths, from which it seemed hopeless that I could ever reascend.  Nor  did I, by waking, feel that I _had_ reascended.  This I do not dwell  upon; because the state of gloom which attended these gorgeous  spectacles, amounting at last to utter darkness, as of some suicidal  despondency, cannot be approached by words.    3.  The sense of space, and in the end the sense of time, were both  powerfully affected.  Buildings, landscapes, &c., were exhibited in  proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to receive.  Space  swelled, and was amplified to an extent of unutterable infinity.  This,  however, did not disturb me so much as the vast expansion of time; I  sometimes seemed to have lived for 70 or 100 years in one night--nay,  sometimes had feelings representative of a millennium passed in that  time, or, however, of a duration far beyond the limits of any human  experience.    4.  The minutest incidents of childhood, or forgotten scenes of later  years, were often revived: I could not be said to recollect them, for if  I had been told of them when waking, I should not have been able to  acknowledge them as parts of my past experience.  But placed as they were  before me, in dreams like intuitions, and clothed in all their evanescent  circumstances and accompanying feelings, I _recognised_ them  instantaneously.  I was once told by a near relative of mine, that having  in her childhood fallen into a river, and being on the very verge of  death but for the critical assistance which reached her, she saw in a  moment her whole life, in its minutest incidents, arrayed before her  simultaneously as in a mirror; and she had a faculty developed as  suddenly for comprehending the whole and every part.  This, from some  opium experiences of mine, I can believe; I have indeed seen the same  thing asserted twice in modern books, and accompanied by a remark which I  am convinced is true; viz., that the dread book of account which the  Scriptures speak of is in fact the mind itself of each individual.  Of  this at least I feel assured, that there is no such thing as _forgetting_  possible to the mind; a thousand accidents may and will interpose a veil  between our present consciousness and the secret inscriptions on the  mind; accidents of the same sort will also rend away this veil; but  alike, whether veiled or unveiled, the inscription remains for ever, just  as the stars seem to withdraw before the common light of day, whereas in  fact we all know that it is the light which is drawn over them as a veil,  and that they are waiting to be revealed when the obscuring daylight  shall have withdrawn.    Having noticed these four facts as memorably distinguishing my dreams  from those of health, I shall now cite a case illustrative of the first  fact, and shall then cite any others that I remember, either in their  chronological order, or any other that may give them more effect as  pictures to the reader.    I had been in youth, and even since, for occasional amusement, a great  reader of Livy, whom I confess that I prefer, both for style and matter,  to any other of the Roman historians; and I had often felt as most solemn  and appalling sounds, and most emphatically representative of the majesty  of the Roman people, the two words so often occurring in Livy--_Consul  Romanus_, especially when the consul is introduced in his military  character.  I mean to say that the words king, sultan, regent, &c., or  any other titles of those who embody in their own persons the collective  majesty of a great people, had less power over my reverential feelings.  I  had also, though no great reader of history, made myself minutely and  critically familiar with one period of English history, viz., the period  of the Parliamentary War, having been attracted by the moral grandeur of  some who figured in that day, and by the many interesting memoirs which  survive those unquiet times.  Both these parts of my lighter reading,  having furnished me often with matter of reflection, now furnished me  with matter for my dreams.  Often I used to see, after painting upon the  blank darkness a sort of rehearsal whilst waking, a crowd of ladies, and  perhaps a festival and dances.  And I heard it said, or I said to myself,  \"These are English ladies from the unhappy times of Charles I.  These are  the wives and the daughters of those who met in peace, and sate at the  same table, and were allied by marriage or by blood; and yet, after a  certain day in August 1642, never smiled upon each other again, nor met  but in the field of battle; and at Marston Moor, at Newbury, or at  Naseby, cut asunder all ties of love by the cruel sabre, and washed away  in blood the memory of ancient friendship.\"  The ladies danced, and  looked as lovely as the court of George IV.  Yet I knew, even in my  dream, that they had been in the grave for nearly two centuries.  This  pageant would suddenly dissolve; and at a clapping of hands would be  heard the heart-quaking sound _of Consul Romanus_; and immediately came  \"sweeping by,\" in gorgeous paludaments, Paulus or Marius, girt round by a  company of centurions, with the crimson tunic hoisted on a spear, and  followed by the _alalagmos_ of the Roman legions.    Many years ago, when I was looking over Piranesi's, Antiquities of Rome,  Mr. Coleridge, who was standing by, described to me a set of plates by  that artist, called his _Dreams_, and which record the scenery of his own  visions during the delirium of a fever.  Some of them (I describe only  from memory of Mr. Coleridge's account) represented vast Gothic halls, on  the floor of which stood all sorts of engines and machinery, wheels,  cables, pulleys, levers, catapults, &c. &c., expressive of enormous power  put forth and resistance overcome.  Creeping along the sides of the walls  you perceived a staircase; and upon it, groping his way upwards, was  Piranesi himself: follow the stairs a little further and you perceive it  come to a sudden and abrupt termination without any balustrade, and  allowing no step onwards to him who had reached the extremity except into  the depths below.  Whatever is to become of poor Piranesi, you suppose at  least that his labours must in some way terminate here.  But raise your  eyes, and behold a second flight of stairs still higher, on which again  Piranesi is perceived, but this time standing on the very brink of the  abyss.  Again elevate your eye, and a still more aerial flight of stairs  is beheld, and again is poor Piranesi busy on his aspiring labours; and  so on, until the unfinished stairs and Piranesi both are lost in the  upper gloom of the hall.  With the same power of endless growth and self-  reproduction did my architecture proceed in dreams.  In the early stage  of my malady the splendours of my dreams were indeed chiefly  architectural; and I beheld such pomp of cities and palaces as was never  yet beheld by the waking eye unless in the clouds.  From a great modern  poet I cite part of a passage which describes, as an appearance actually  beheld in the clouds, what in many of its circumstances I saw frequently  in sleep:       The appearance, instantaneously disclosed,     "]]]
