A full flock gathered to escort them as they continued along the outer  line of the reef. Thorvald impatiently dug his paddle deeper. They had  explored more than half of the reef now without chancing on an entrance  channel.    \"Regular fence,\" Shann commented. One could begin to believe that the  barrier had been deliberately reared to frustrate visitors. Hot  sunshine, reflected back from the surface of the waves, burned their  exposed skin, so they dared not discard their ragged clothing. And the  wolverines were growing increasingly restless. Shann did not know how  much longer the animals would consent to their position as passengers  without raising active protest.    \"How about trying the next one?\" he asked, knowing at the same time his  companion was not in any mood to accept such a suggestion with good  will.    The officer made no reply, but continued to use his steer paddle in a  fashion which spelled out his stubborn determination to find a passage.  This was a personal thing now, between Ragnar Thorvald of the Terran  Survey and a wall of rock, and the man's will was as strongly rooted as  those water-washed stones.    On the southwestern tip of the reef they discovered a possible opening.  Shann eyed the narrow space between two fanglike rocks dubiously. To him  that width of water lane seemed dangerously limited, the sudden slam of  a wave could dash them against either of those pillars, with disastrous  results, before they could move to save themselves. But Thorvald pointed  their blunt bow toward the passage with seeming confidence, and Shann  knew that as far as the officer was concerned, this was their door to  the lagoon.    Thorvald might be stubborn, but he was not a fool. And his training and  skill in such maneuvers was proved when the canoe rode in a rising swell  in and by those rocks to gain the safety, in seconds, of the calm  lagoon. Shann sighed with relief, but ventured no comment.    Now they must paddle back along the inner side of the reef to locate the  beaches, for fronting them on this side of the well-protected island  were cliffs as formidable as those which guarded the first of the chain  at which they had aimed.    Shann glanced now and then over the side of the boat, hoping in these  shallows to sight the sea bed or some of the inhabitants of these  waters. But there was no piercing that green murk. Here and there  nodules of rock projected inches or feet above the surface, awash in the  wavelets, to be avoided by the voyagers. Shann's shoulders ached and  burned, his muscles were unaccustomed to the steady swing of the  paddles, and the fire of the sun stabbed easily through only two layers  of ragged cloth to his skin. He ran a dry tongue over dryer lips and  gazed eagerly ahead in search of the first of the beaches.    What was so important about this island that Thorvald _had_ to make a  landing here? The officer's stories of a native race which they might  turn against the Throgs to their own advantage was thin, very thin  indeed. Especially now, as Shann weighed an unsupported theory against  that ache in his shoulders, the possibility of being marooned on the  inhospitable shore ahead, against the fifty probable dangers he could  total up with very little expenditure of effort. A small nagging doubt  of Thorvald's obsession began to grow in his mind. How could Shann even  be sure that that carved disk and Thorvald's hokus-pokus with it had  been on the level? On the other hand what motive would the officer have  for trying such an act just to impress Shann?    The beach at last! As they headed the canoe in that direction the  wolverines nearly brought disaster on them. The animals' restlessness  became acute as they sighted and scented the shore and knew that they  were close. Taggi reared, plunged over the side of the craft, and Shann  had just time to fling his weight in the opposite direction as a  counterbalance when Togi followed. They splashed shoreward while  Thorvald swore fluently and Shann grabbed to save the precious supply  bag. In a shower of gravel the animals made land and humped well up on  the strand before pausing to shake themselves and splatter far and wide  the burden of moisture transported by their shaggy fur.    Ashore, the canoe became a clumsy burden and, light as the craft was,  both of the men sweated to get it up on the beach without snagging the  outrigger against stones and brush. With the thought of a Throg patrol  in mind they worked swiftly to cover it.    Taggi raised an egg-patterned snout from a hollow and licked at the  stippling of greenish yolk matting his fur. The wolverines had wasted no  time in sampling the contents of a wealth of nesting places beginning  just above the high-water mark, cupping two to four tough-shelled eggs  in each. Treading a path among those clutches, the Terrans climbed a  red-earthed slope toward the interior of the island.    They found water, not the clear running of a mountain spring, but a  stalish pool in a stone-walled depression on the crest of a rise,  filled by the bounty of the rain. The warm liquid was brackish, but  satisfied in part their thirst, and they drank eagerly.    The outer cliff wall of the island was just that, a wall, for there was  an inner slope to match the outer. And at the bottom of it a showing of  purple-green foliage where plants and stunted trees fought for living  space. But there was nothing else, though they quartered that growing  section with the care of men trying to locate an enemy outpost.    That night they camped in the hollow, roasted eggs in a fire, and ate  the fishy-tasting contents because it was food, not because they  relished what they swallowed. Tonight no cloud bank hung overhead. A  man, gazing up, could see the stars. The stars and other things, for  over the distant shore of the mainland they sighted the cruising lights  of a Throg ship and waited tensely for that circle of small sparkling  points to swing out toward their own hiding hole.    \"They haven't given up,\" Shann stated what was obvious to them both.    \"The settler transport,\" Thorvald reminded him. \"If they do not take a  prisoner to talk her in and allay suspicion, then--\" he snapped his  fingers--\"the Patrol will be on their tails, but quick!\"    So just by keeping out of Throg range, they were, in a way, still  fighting. Shann settled back, his tender shoulders resting against a  tree hole. He tried to count the number of days and nights lying behind  him now since that early morning when he had watched the Terran camp die  under the aliens' weapons. But one day faded into another so that he  could remember only action parts clearly--the attack on the grounded  scoutship, the sortie they had made in turn on the occupied camp, the  dust storm on the river, the escape from the Throg ship in the mountain  crevice, and their meeting with the hound. Then that storm which had  driven them to seek cover after their curious experience with the disk.  And now this day when they had safely reached the island.    \"Why this island?\" he asked suddenly.    \"That carved piece was found here on the edge of this valley,\" Thorvald  returned matter-of-factly.    \"But today we found nothing at all----\"    \"Yet this island supplies us with a starting point.\"    A starting point for what? A detailed search of all the islands, great  and small, in the chain? And how did they dare continue to paddle openly  from one to the next with the Throgs sweeping the skies? They would have  provided an excellent target today as they combed that reef for an hour  or more. Wearily, Shann spread out his hands in the very faint light of  their tiny fire, poked with a finger tip at smarting points which would  have been blisters had those hands not known a toughening process in the  past. More paddling tomorrow? But that was tomorrow, and at least they  need not worry tonight about any Throg attack once they had doused the  fire, an action which was now being methodically attended to by  Thorvald. Shann pushed down on the bed of leaves he had heaped together.  The night was quiet. He could hear only the murmur of the sea, a lulling  croon of sound to make one sleep deep, perhaps dreamlessly.    Sun struck down, making a dazzle about him. Shann turned over drowsily  in that welcome heat, stretching a little as might a cat at ease. Then  he really awoke under the press of memory, and the need for alertness  rode him once more. Beaten-down grass, the burnt-out embers of last  night's fire were beside him. But of Thorvald and the wolverines there  were no signs.    Not only did he now lie alone, but he was possessed by the feeling that  he had not been deserted only momentarily, that Taggi, Togi and the  Survey officer were indeed gone. Shann sat up, got to his feet,  breathing faster, a prickle of uneasiness spreading in him, bringing him  to that inner slope, up it to the crest from which he could see that  beach where last night they had concealed the canoe.    Those lengths of brush and tufts of grass they had used for a screen  were strewn about as if tossed in haste. And not too long before....    For the canoe was out in the calm waters within the reef, the paddle  blade wielded by its occupant flashing brightly in the sun. On the  shingle below, the wolverines prowled back and forth, whining in  bewilderment.    \"Thorvald----!\"    Shann put the full force of his lungs into that hail, hearing the name  ring from one of the small peaks at his back. But the man in the boat  did not turn his head; there was no change in the speed of that paddle  dip.    Shann leaped down the outer slope to the beach, skidding the last few  feet, saving himself from going headfirst into the water only by a  painful wrench of his body.    \"Thorvald!\" He tried calling again. But that head, bright under the sun  did not turn; there was no answer.

Two more warp-drive shifts through space had taken the _Swiftwing_ far,  far out to the rim of the known galaxy, and now the great crimson coal  of Antares burned in their viewports.    Antares had twelve planets, the outermost of which--far away now, at the  furthest point in its orbit from the point of the _Swiftwing_'s entry  into the system--was a small captive sun. No larger than the planet  Earth, it revolved every ninety years around its huge primary.    Small as it was, it was blazingly blue-white brilliant, and had a tiny  planet of its own. After their stop on Antares Seven--the largest of the  inhabited planets in this system, where the Lhari spaceport was  located--they would make a careful orbit around the great red primary,  and land on the tiny worldlet of the blue-white secondary before leaving  the Antares system.    As Bart watched Antares growing in the viewports, he felt a variety of  emotions. On the one hand, he was relieved that as his voyage in secrecy  neared its official destination, he had as yet not incurred unmasking.    But he felt uncertain about his father's co-conspirators. Would they  return him to human form and send him back to Vega, his part ended? Or  would they, unthinkably, demand that he go on into the Lhari Galaxy?  What would he do, if they did?    At one moment he entertained fantasies of going on into the Lhari  worlds, returning victorious with the secret of their fueling location,  or of the star-drive itself. At another, he could not wait to be free of  it all. He longed for the society of his own people, yet ached to think  that this voyage between the stars must end so soon.    They made planetfall at the largest Lhari spaceport Bart had seen; as  always, the Second Officer was the first to go through Decontam and  ashore, returning with exchanged mail and messages for the _Swiftwing_'s  crew. He laughed when he gave Bartol a sealed packet. \"So you're not  quite the orphan we've always thought!\"    Bart took it, his heart suddenly pounding, and walked away through the  groups of officers and crew eagerly debating how they would spend their  port leave. He knew what it would be.    It was on the letterhead of Eight Colors, and it contained no message.  Only an address--and a time.    He slipped away unobserved to the Mentorian part of the ship to borrow a  cloak from Meta. She did not ask why he wanted it, and stopped him when  he would have told her. \"I'd--rather not know.\"    She looked very small and very scared, and Bart wished he could comfort  her, but he knew she would shrink from him, repelled and horrified by  his Lhari skin, hair, claws.    Yet she reached for his hand, gripping it hard in her own dainty one.  \"Bartol, be careful,\" she whispered, then stopped. \"Bartol--that's a  Lhari name. What's your real one?\"    \"Bart. Bart Steele.\"    \"Good luck, Bart.\" There were tears in her gray eyes.    With the blue cloak folded around his face, hands tucked in the slits at  the side, he felt almost like himself. And as the strange crimson  twilight folded down across the streets, laden with spicy smells and  little, fragrant gusts of wind, he almost savored the sense of being a  conspirator, of playing for high stakes in a network of intrigue between  the stars. He was off on an adventure, and meant to enjoy it.    The address he had been given was a lavish estate, not far from the  spaceport, across a little gleaming lake that shimmered red, indigo,  violet in the crimson sunset, surrounded by a low wall of what looked  like purple glass. Bart, moving slowly through the gate, felt that eyes  were watching him, and forced himself to walk with slow dignity.    Up the path. Up a low flight of black-marble stairs. A door swung open  and shut again, closing out the red sunset, letting him into a room that  seemed dim after the months of Lhari lights. There were three men in the  room, but his eyes were drawn instantly to one, standing against an  old-fashioned fireplace.    He was very tall and quite thin, and his hair was snow-white, though he  did not look old. Bart's first incongruous thought was, _He'd make a  better Lhari than I would._ His firm, commanding voice told Bart at once  that this was the man in charge. \"You are Bartol?\" He extended his hand.    Bart took it--and found himself gripped in a judo hold. The other two  men, leaping to place behind him, felt all over his body, not gently.    \"No weapons, Montano.\"    \"Look here--\"    \"Save it,\" Montano said. \"If you're the right person, you'll understand.  If not, you won't have much time to resent it. A very simple test. What  color is that divan?\"    \"Green.\"    \"And those curtains?\"    \"Darker green, with gold and red figures.\"    The men released him, and the white-haired man smiled.    \"So you actually did it, Steele! I thought for sure the code message was  a fake.\" He stepped back and looked Bart over from head to foot,  whistling. \"Raynor Three is a genius! Claws and everything! What a deuce  of a risk to take though!\"    \"You know my name,\" Bart said, \"but who are you?\"    Suspicion came back into the dark eyes. \"Does that Mentorian cloak  mean--you've lost your memories, too?\"    \"No,\" said Bart, \"it's simpler than that. I'm not Rupert Steele.  I'm--\" his voice caught--\"I'm his son.\"    The man looked startled and shocked. \"I suppose that means Rupert is  dead. Dead! It came a little before he expected it, then. So you're  Bart.\" He sighed. \"My name's Montano. This is Hedrick, and I suppose you  recognize Raynor Two.\"    Bart blinked. It was the same face, but it was not grim like Raynor  One's, nor expressive and kindly like that of Raynor Three. This one  just looked dangerous.    \"But sit down,\" Montano said with a wave of his hand, \"make yourself  comfortable.\"    Hedrick relieved Bart of his cloak; Raynor Two put a cup of some  steaming drink in his hand, passed him a tray of small hot fried things  that tasted crisp and delicious. Bart relaxed, answering questions. _How  old? Only seventeen? And you came all alone on a Lhari ship, working  your way as Astrogator? I must say you've got guts, kid!_ It was  dangerously like the fantasy he had invented. But Montano interrupted at  last.    \"All right, this isn't a party and we haven't all night. I don't suppose  Bart has either. Enough time wasted. Since you walked into this, young  Steele, I take it you know what our plans are, after this?\"    Bart shook his head. \"No. Raynor Three sent me to call off your plans,  because of my father--\"    \"That sounds like Three,\" interrupted Raynor Two. \"Entirely too  squeamish!\"    Montano said irritably, \"We couldn't have done anything without a man on  the _Swiftwing_, and you know it. We still can't. Bart, I suppose you  know about Lharillis.\"    \"Not by that name.\"    \"Your next stop. The planetoid of the captive sun. That little hunk of  bare rock out there is the first spot the Lhari visited in this  galaxy--even before Mentor. It's an inferno of light from that little  blue-white sun, so of course they love it--it's just like home to them.  When they found that the inner planets of Antares were inhabited, they  built their spaceport here, so they'd have a better chance at trade.\"  Montano scowled fiercely.    \"But they wanted that little worldlet. So we went all over it to be sure  there were no rare minerals there, and finally leased it to them, a  century at a time. They mine the place for some kind of powdered  lubricant that's better than graphite--it's all done by robot machinery,  no one's stationed there. Every time a Lhari ship comes through this  system they stop there, even though there's nothing on Lharillis except  a landing field and some concrete bunkers filled with robot mining  machinery. They'll stop there on the way out of this system--and that's  where you come in. We need you on board, to put the radiation counter  out of commission.\"    He took a chart from a drawer, spread it out on a table top. \"The  simplest way would be to cut these two wires. When the Lhari land, we'll  be there, waiting for them. On board the Lhari ship, there must be full  records--coordinates of their home world, of where they go for their  catalyst fuel--all that.\"    Bart whistled. \"But won't the crew defend the ship? You can't fight  energon-ray guns!\"    Montano's face was perfectly calm. \"No. We won't even try.\" He handed  Bart a small strip of pale-yellow plastic.    \"Keep this out of sight of the Mentorians,\" he said. \"The Lhari won't be  able to see the color, of course. But when it turns orange, take cover.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Radiation-exposure film. It's exactly as sensitive to radiation as you  are. When it starts to turn orange, it's picking up radiation. If you're  aboard the ship, get into the drive chambers--they're lead-lined--and  you'll be safe. If you're out on the surface, you'll be all right inside  one of the concrete bunkers. But get under cover before it turns red,  because by that time every Lhari of them will be stone-cold dead.\"    Bart let the strip of plastic drop, staring in disbelief at Montano's  cold, cruel face. \"Kill them? Kill a whole _shipload_ of them? That's  _murder_!\"    \"Not murder. War.\"    \"We're not at war with the Lhari! We have a treaty with them!\"    \"The Federation has, because they don't dare do anything else,\" Montano  said, his face taking on the fanatic's light, \"but some of us dare do  something, some of us aren't going to sit forever and let them strangle  all humanity, hold us down, let us _die_! It's war, Bart, war for  economic survival. Do you suppose the Lhari would hesitate to kill  anyone if we did anything to hurt their monopoly of the stars? Or didn't  they tell you about David Briscoe, how they hunted him down like an  animal--\"    \"But how do we know that was Lhari policy, and not just--some fanatic?\"  Bart asked suddenly. He thought of the death of the elder Briscoe,"]]]
