[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21200"],[0,"The Letters of Cicero, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,": for I suppose that, having  offered victims before your Amaltheia,[77] you at once started for the  siege of Sicyon. And yet I am not even certain when you start to visit  Antonius or how much time you are devoting to Epirus. Accordingly, I  don't venture to trust either Achaeans or Epirotes with a letter somewhat  more outspoken than usual. Now some events _have_ occurred since you  left me worth my writing to you, but they must not be trusted to the  risk of a letter being lost, opened, or intercepted.    Well, then, to begin with: I was not called upon to speak first, and the  pacifier of the Allobroges[78] was preferred to me, and though this met  with some murmurs of disapprobation from the senate, I was not sorry it  was done. For I am thereby freed from any obligation to shew respect to  an ill-conditioned man, and am at liberty to support my position in the  Republic in spite of him. Besides, the second place has a dignity almost  equal to that of _princeps senatus_, and does not put one under too much  of an obligation to the consul. The third called on was Catulus; the  fourth, if you want to go still farther, Hortensius. The consul  himself[79] is a man of a small and ill-regulated mind, a mere buffoon  of that splenetic kind which raises a laugh even in the absence of wit:  it is his face rather than his facetiousness[80] that causes merriment:  he takes practically no part in public business, and is quite alienated  from the Optimates. You need expect no service to the state from him,  for he has not the will to do any, nor fear any damage, for he hasn't  the courage to inflict it. His colleague, however, treats me with great  distinction, and is also a zealous supporter of the loyalist party. For  the present their disagreement has not come to much; but I fear that  this taint may spread farther. For I suppose you have heard that when  the state function was being performed in Caesar's house a man in woman's  dress got in,[81] and that the Vestals having performed the rite again,  mention was made of the matter in the senate by Q. Cornificius--he was  the first, so don't think that it was one of us consulars--and that on  the matter being referred by a decree of the senate to the [Virgins and]  pontifices, they decided that a sacrilege had been committed: that then,  on a farther decree of the senate, the consuls published a bill: and  that Caesar divorced his wife. On this question Piso, from friendship for  P. Clodius, is doing his best to get the bill promulgated by himself  (though in accordance with a decree of the senate and on a point of  religion) rejected. Messalla as yet is strongly for severe measures. The  loyalists hold aloof owing to the entreaties of Clodius: bands of  ruffians are being got together: I myself, at first a stern Lycurgus, am  becoming daily less and less keen about it: Cato is hot and eager. In  short, I fear that between the indifference of the loyalists and the  support of the disloyal it may be the cause of great evils to the  Republic. However, your great friend[82]--do you know whom I mean?--of  whom you said in your letter that, \"not venturing to blame me, he was  beginning to be complimentary,\" is now to all appearance exceedingly  fond of me, embraces me, loves and praises me in public, while in secret  (though unable to disguise it) he is jealous of me. No good-breeding, no  straightforwardness, no political morality, no distinction, no courage,  no liberality! But on these points I will write to you more minutely at  another time; for in the first place I am not yet quite sure about them,  and in the next place I dare not intrust a letter on such weighty  matters to such a casual nobody's son as this messenger.    The praetors have not yet drawn their lots for the provinces. The matter  remains just where you left it. The description of the scenery of  Misenum and Puteoli which you ask for I will include in my speech.[83] I  had already noticed the mistake in the date, 3rd of December. The points  in my speeches which you praise, believe me, I liked very much myself,  but did not venture to say so before. Now, however, as they have  received your approval, I think them much more \"Attic\" than ever. To the  speech in answer to Metellus[84] I have made some additions. The book  shall be sent you, since affection for me gives you a taste for  rhetoric. What news have I for you? Let me see. Oh, yes! The consul  Messalla has bought Antonius's house for 3,400 sestertia (about  L27,200). What is that to me? you will say. Why, thus much. The price  has convinced people that I made no bad bargain, and they begin to  understand that in making a purchase a man may properly use his friends'  means to get what suits his position. The Teucris affair drags on, yet I  have hopes. Pray settle the business you have in hand. You shall have a  more outspoken letter soon.    27 January, in the consulship of M. Messalla and M. Piso.    [Footnote 75: _Ora soluta._ Or, if _ancora sublata_ be read, \"when the  anchor was already weighed.\" In either case it means \"just as you were  starting.\" Atticus wrote on board, and gave the letter to a carrier to  take on shore.]    [Footnote 76: A word lost in the text.]    [Footnote 77: See end of Letter XXI. Cicero playfully supposes that  Atticus only stayed in his villa in Epirus to offer sacrifices to the  nymph in his gymnasium, and then hurried off to Sicyon, where people  owed him money which he wanted to get. He goes to Antonius first to get  his authority for putting pressure on Sicyon, and perhaps even some  military force.]    [Footnote 78: C. Calpurnius Piso (consul B.C. 67), brother of the consul  of the year, had been governor of Gallia Narbonensis (B.C. 66-65), and  had suppressed a rising of the Allobroges, the most troublesome tribe in  the province, who were, in fact, again in rebellion.]    [Footnote 79: M. Pupius Piso.]    [Footnote 80: \"By the expression of his face rather than the force of  his expressions\" (Tyrrell).]    [Footnote 81: See p. 27, note 2.]    [Footnote 82: Pompey.]    [Footnote 83: Or, \"inclose with my speech\"; in both cases the dative  _orationi meae_ is peculiar. No speech exists containing such a  description, but we have only two of the previous year extant (_pro  Flacco_ and _pro Archia Poeta_). Cicero was probably sending it,  whichever it was, to Atticus to be copied by his _librarii_, and  published. Atticus had apparently some other works of Cicero's in hand,  for which he had sent him some \"queries.\"]    [Footnote 84: Apparently the speech in the senate referred to in Letter  XIV, p. 23, spoken on 1st January, B.C. 62. Metellus had prevented his  _contio_ the day before.]          XIX (A I, 14)    TO ATTICUS (IN EPIRUS)    ROME, 13 FEBRUARY      [Sidenote: B.C. 61, AET. 45]    I fear it may seem affectation to tell you how occupied I have been; but  I am so distracted with business that I have only just found time for  this short letter, and that has been stolen from the most urgent  engagements. I have already described to you Pompey's first public  speech--it did not please the poor, nor satisfy the disloyal, nor find  favour with the wealthy, nor appear sound to the loyalists; accordingly,  he is down in the world.[85] Presently, on the instigation of the consul  Piso, that most insignificant of tribunes, Fufius, brought Pompey on to  the platform. The meeting was in the _circus Flaminius_, and there was  in the same place that day a crowd of market people--a kind of _tiers  etat_.[86] He asked him to say whether he approved of the jurymen being  selected by the praetor, to form a panel for the praetor himself to  employ. That was the regulation made by the senate in the matter of  Clodius's sacrilege. Thereupon Pompey made a highly \"aristocratic\"  speech, and replied (and at great length) that in all matters the  authority of the senate was of the greatest weight in his eyes and had  always been so. Later on the consul Messalla in the senate asked Pompey  his opinion as to the sacrilege and the bill that had been published.  His speech in the senate amounted to a general commendation of all  decrees of the house, and when he sat down he said to me, \"I think my  answer covers your case also.\"[87] When Crassus observed that Pompey had  got a cheer from the idea in men's minds that he approved my consulship,  he rose also to his feet and delivered a speech in the most  complimentary terms on my consulship, going so far as to say that he  owed it to me that he was still a senator, a citizen, nay, a free man;  and that he never beheld wife, home, or country without beholding the  fruits of my conduct. In short: that whole topic, which I am wont to  paint in various colours in my speeches (of which you are the  Aristarchus), the fire, the sword--you know my paint-pots--he elaborated  to the highest pitch. I was sitting next to Pompey. I noticed that he  was agitated, either at Crassus earning the gratitude which he had  himself neglected, or to think that my achievements were, after all, of  such magnitude that the senate was so glad to hear them praised,  especially by a man who was the less under an obligation to praise me,  because in everything I ever wrote[88] my praise of Pompey was  practically a reflexion on him. This day has brought me very close to  Crassus, and yet in spite of all I accepted with pleasure any  compliment--open or covert--from Pompey. But as for my own speech, good  heavens! how I did \"put it on\" for the benefit of my new auditor Pompey!  If I ever did bring every art into play, I did then--period, transition,  enthymeme, deduction--everything. In short, I was cheered to the echo.  For the subject of my speech was the dignity of the senate, its harmony  with the equites, the unanimity of Italy, the dying embers of the  conspiracy, the fall in prices, the establishment of peace. You know my  thunder when these are my themes.

Northward from Eldoma Ravine for days we marched, sometimes in dense  forests so thick that a man could scarcely force himself through the  undergrowth that flanked the trail, and sometimes through upland meadows  so deep in tall yellow grass as to suggest a field of waving grain, then  through miles of country studded with the gnarled thorn tree that looks  so much like our apple trees at home. It was as though we were  traversing an endless orchard, clean, beautiful, and exhilarating in the  cool winds of the African highlands. And then, all suddenly, we came to  the end of the trees, and before us, like a great, heaving yellow sea,  lay the Guas Ngishu Plateau that stretches northward one hundred miles  and always above seven thousand feet in altitude.    Far ahead, like a little knob of blue, was Sergoi Hill, forty miles  away, and beyond, in a fainter blue, were the hills that mark the limit  of white man's passport. On the map that district is marked: \"Natives  probably treacherous.\" Off to the left, a hundred miles away, the dim  outline of Mount Elgon rose in easy slopes from the horizon. Elgon, with  its elephants, was our goal, and in between were the black-maned lions  that we hoped to meet.    It would be hard to exaggerate the charm of this climate. And yet this,  one thought, was equatorial Africa, which, in the popular imagination,  is supposed to be synonymous with torrential rains, malignant fevers,  and dense jungles of matted vegetation. It was more like the friendly  stretches of Colorado scenery at the time of year when the grasses of  the valley are dotted with flowers of many colors and the sun shines  down upon you with genial warmth.    [Drawing: _A Night on the Equator_]    Each morning we marched ten or twelve miles and then went into camp near  some little stream. In the afternoon we hunted for lions, beating out  swamps, scouting every bit of cover and combing the tall grass for hours  at a time. Hartebeest, topi, zebra, eland, oribi, reedbuck, and small  grass antelope were upon all sides and at all times.    The herds of zebra and hartebeest literally numbered thousands, but,  except as the latter were occasionally required for food for the  porters, we seldom tried to shoot them. Every Boer settler we saw was  interviewed and every promising lion clue was followed to the bitter  end, but without result. Sometimes we remained in one camp a day or more  in order to search the lion retreats more thoroughly, but never a  black-maned lion was routed from his lair. A few weeks later, when the  dry grass had been burned to make way for new grass, as is done each  year, the chances would be greatly improved, and we hoped for better  luck when we retraced our steps from Elgon in December. Before that time  it would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack to find a lion in  the tall grass, and a good deal more dangerous if we did find one. There  were lots of them there, but they were taking excellent care of  themselves. In July, three months previous, Mr. McMillan, Mr. Selous,  and Mr. Williams were in this same district after black-maned lions.  They heard them every night, but saw only one in several weeks. This  one, however, made a distinct impression. Williams saw it one day and  wounded it at two hundred yards. The lion charged and could not be  stopped by Williams' bullets. It was only after it had leaped on the  hunter and frightfully mauled him that the lion succumbed to its wounds.  And it was only after months of suffering that Williams finally  recovered from the mauling.    We felt that if Frederick Selous, the world's greatest big game hunter,  could not find the lion, then our chances were somewhat slim.    [Drawing: _Lion Hunting in Tall Grass_]    There had been few parties in this district since McMillan's party left.  Captain Ashton came in two months before us, and we met him on his way  out. With him was Captain Black, a professional elephant hunter, who,  three years before, on the Aberdare, had had a bad experience with an  elephant. It was a cow that he had wounded but failed to kill. She  charged him and knocked him down in a pile of very thick and matted  brush. Three times she trampled him under her feet, but the bushes  served as a kind of mattress and the captain escaped with only a few  hones broken; although he was laid up for five weeks. Ashton and Black  did not have much luck in the present trip and failed to get a single  lion.    Two Spaniards passed our camp one day, inward bound. They were the Duke  of Penaranda and Sr. de la Huerta, and reported no lions during their  few days in the district. Prince Lichtenstein was also somewhere on the  plateau, but we didn't run across him. In addition to these three  parties and ours, the only other expedition in the Guas Ngishu Plateau  was Colonel Roosevelt's party, toward which, by previous agreement, we  made our way.    A number of months before Mr. Akeley, who headed our party, was dining  with President Roosevelt at the White House. In the course of their  talk, which was about Africa and Mr. Akeley's former African hunting and  collecting experiences, the latter had told the president about a group  of elephants that he was going to collect and mount for the American  Museum of History in New York. President Roosevelt was asked if he would  cooeperate in the work, and he expressed a keen willingness to do so.  When our party arrived at Nairobi, in September, a letter awaited Mr.  Akeley, renewing Colonel Roosevelt's desire to help in collecting the  group.    It was in answer to this invitation that Mr. Akeley and our party had  gone to the Mount Elgon country to meet Mr. Roosevelt and carry out the  elephant-hunting compact made many months before at the White House.    [Photograph: Kermit, Leslie Tarlton and Colonel Roosevelt]    [Photograph: Winding Through Unbroken Country]    [Photograph: Our Safari on the March]    Eleven days of marching and hunting from the railroad brought us to  Sergoi, the very uttermost outpost of semi-civilization. Here we found  another letter in which Mr. Akeley was asked to come to the Roosevelt  camp, and which suggested that a native runner could pilot him to its  whereabouts. The letter had been written some days before and had been  for some time at Sergoi. Whether the Roosevelt camp had been moved in  the meantime could not be determined at Sergoi, and we knew only in a  general way that it was probably somewhere on the Nzoia River  (pronounced Enzoya), two or three days' march west of Sergoi, toward  Mount Elgon.    So we started across, meeting no natives who possibly could have given  any information. On the afternoon of November thirteenth we went into  camp on the edge of a great swamp, or _tinga-tinga_, as the natives  call it, only a couple of hours' march from the river. Many fresh  elephant trails had been discovered, and the swamp itself looked like a  most promising place for lions. A great tree stood on one side of the  swamp, and in its branches was a platform which an Englishman had  occupied seven nights in a vain quest for lions some time before. A  little grass shelter was below the tree, and as we approached a  Wanderobo darted out and ran in terror from us. The Wanderobos are  native hunters who live in the forests, and are as shy as wild animals.  So we could not question him as to Colonel Roosevelt's camp. Later in  the afternoon a native runner appeared from the direction of Sergoi with  a message to the colonel, but he didn't know where the camp was and  didn't seem to be in any great hurry to find out. He calmly made himself  the guest of one of our porters and spent the night in our camp, doing  much more sitting than running.    On the morning of the fourteenth we marched toward the river, two hours  away, the native runner slowly ambling along with us. We had been on the  trail about an hour and a half when a shot was heard off to our left; At  first we thought it was our Spanish friends, but a few moments later we  came to a point where we could see, about a mile away, a long string of  porters winding along in the direction from which we came, it was  plainly a much larger _safari_ than the Spanish one, and we at once  concluded that it was Colonel Roosevelt's.    Three or four men on horses were visible, but could not be recognized  with our glasses. The number corresponded to the colonel's party,  however, which we knew to consist of himself and Kermit, Edmund Heller  and Leslie Tarlton. A messenger was sent across the hills to establish  their identity and we marched on to the river, a half-hour farther,  where we found the smoldering fires of their camp.    A transport wagon of supplies for the Duke of Penaranda's _safari_ was  also there, and from the drivers it was definitely learned that the late  occupants of the camp were Mr. Roosevelt and his party. In the meantime  the messenger had reached Colonel Roosevelt, and when the latter learned  that Mr. Akeley's _safari_ was in the vicinity he at once ordered camp  pitched forty-five minutes from our camp, and started across to see  Akeley. The latter had also started across to see the colonel, and they  met on the way. And during all this time the native runner with the  message to Colonel Roosevelt was loafing the morning away in our camp.  What the message might be, of course, we didn't know, but we hoped that  it was nothing of importance. It was only when the colonel and his party  reached our camp that the message was delivered. As we stood talking and  congratulating everybody on how well he was looking the colonel casually  opened the message.    He seemed amused, and somewhat surprised, and at once read it aloud to  us. It was from America, and said: \"Reported here you have been killed.  Mrs. Roosevelt worried. Cable denial American Embassy, Rome.\" It was  dated November sixth, eight days before.    \"I think I might answer that by"]]]
