I never know'd him to.\"    \"Then you know Dick?\"    \"Yes, sir. I've knowed him ever since I was so high,\" indicating a point  about three feet above the floor.    \"Then who did take it, if not he?\"    \"Micky Maguire.\"    \"Who is he?\"    \"He blacks boots.\"    \"Then how did it happen that he was not arrested?\"    \"Micky was smart enough to drop the wallet into Dick's pocket as he was  standin' before a shop winder. Then he got out of the way, and Dick was  nabbed by the 'copp.'\"    \"Is this Micky of whom you speak a friend of yours?\"    \"No; he likes to bully small boys.\"    \"Then why didn't you tell the officer he had arrested the wrong boy?\"    \"I wanted to,\" said Tim, \"for Dick's always been kind to me; but I was  afraid Micky would give me a beatin' when he got free. Then there was  another reason.\"    \"What was that?\"    \"It's mean to tell of a fellow.\"    \"Isn't it meaner to let an innocent boy get punished, when you might  save him by telling?\"    \"Maybe it is,\" said Tim, perplexed.    \"My lad,\" continued Mr. Murdock, \"you say Dick has been kind to you. You  now have an opportunity to repay all he has ever done, by clearing him  from this false charge, which you can easily do.\"    \"I'll do it,\" said Tim, stoutly. \"I don't care if Micky does lick me for  it.\"    \"By the way,\" said Mr. Murdock, with a sudden thought, \"what is the  appearance of this Micky Maguire?\"    \"He's rather stout, and has freckles.\"    \"Does he wear a blue coat, with large brass buttons?\"    \"Yes,\" said Tim, in surprise. \"Do you know him?\"    \"I have seen him this morning,\" said Mr. Murdock. \"Wait a minute, and I  will give you a line to Dick; or rather it will not be necessary. If you  can get a chance, let him know that I am going to call on him this  afternoon. Will you be at the station-house, or near it, at six  o'clock?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then we can arrange about your appearing as a witness at the trial.  Here is half a dollar for your trouble in bringing the note.\"    \"I don't want it, sir,\" said Tim. \"I don't want to take anything for  doing a good turn to Dick.\"    \"But you have been prevented from earning money. You had better take  it.\"    But Tim, who was a warm-hearted Irish boy, steadfastly refused, and left  the store in quest of Henderson's hat and cap store, having also a note  to deliver to Fosdick.    \"So that was Micky Maguire who was here a little while since,\" said Mr.  Murdock to himself. \"It seems singular that immediately after getting  Richard into trouble, he should have come here where he was employed.  Can it be that Gilbert had a previous acquaintance with him?\"    The more Mr. Murdock reflected, the more perplexed he became. It did  cross his mind that the two might be in league against Dick; but then,  on the other hand, they evidently parted on bad terms, and this seemed  to make such a combination improbable. So he gave up puzzling himself  about it, reflecting that time would clear up what seemed mysterious  about the affair.    Gilbert, on his part, could not help wondering on what errand Tim Ryan  came to Mr. Murdock. He suspected he might be a messenger from Dick, but  thought it best not to inquire, and Mr. Murdock did not volunteer any  information. When the store closed, the head clerk bent his steps  towards the station-house.          CHAPTER XV.    THE FRANKLIN STREET STATION-HOUSE.      The station-house to which Dick had been conveyed is situated in that  part of Franklin Street which lies between Centre and Baxter Streets.  The last is one of the most wretched streets in the city, lined with  miserable tenement houses, policy shops, and second-hand clothing  stores. Whoever passes through it in the evening, will do well to look  to the safety of his pocket-book and watch, if he is imprudent enough to  carry either in a district where the Ten Commandments are unknown, or  unregarded.    The station-house is an exception to the prevailing squalidness, being  kept with great neatness. Mr. Murdock ascended the steps, and found  himself in a large room, one side of which was fenced off by a railing.  Behind this was a desk, at which sat the officer in charge. To him, Mr.  Murdock directed himself.    \"Have you a boy, named Richard Hunter, in the house?\"    \"Yes,\" said the sergeant, referring to his minutes. \"He was brought in  this afternoon, charged with picking a gentleman's pocket.\"    \"There is some mistake about this. He is as honest as I am.\"    \"I have nothing to do with that. He will have a fair trial to-morrow  morning. All I have to do is to keep him in safe custody till then.\"    \"Of course. Where is he?\"    \"In a cell below.\"    \"Can I see him?\"    \"If you wish.\"    The officer summoned an attendant, and briefly ordered him to conduct  Mr. Murdock to Dick's cell.    \"This way, sir,\" said the attendant.    Mr. Murdock followed him through a large rear room, which is intended  for the accommodation of the officers. Then, descending some steps into  the courtyard, he descended thence into the apartments in the basement.  Here are the cells for the temporary detention of offenders who are not  at once sent to the Tombs for trial. The passages are whitewashed and  the cells look very neat. They are on either side, with a grating, so  that one passing along can look into them readily. They are probably  about seven feet long, by four or five in width. A narrow raised  bedstead, covered with a pallet, occupies one side, on which the  prisoner can either lie or sit, as he pleases.    \"How are you, boss?\" asked a negro woman, who had been arrested for  drunkenness, swaying forward, as Mr. Murdock passed, and nearly losing  her balance as she did so. \"Can't you give me a few cents to buy some  supper?\"    Turning from this revolting spectacle, Mr. Murdock followed his guide to  the second cell beyond where our hero was confined.    \"Is it you, Mr. Murdock?\" exclaimed our hero, joyfully jumping to his  feet. \"I am glad to see you.\"    \"And I am glad to see you; but I wish it were somewhere else,\" said Mr.  Murdock.    \"So do I,\" said Dick. \"I aint partial to this hotel, though the  accommodations is gratooitous, and the company is very select.\"    \"I see you will have your joke, Dick, even in such a place.\"    \"I don't feel so jolly as I might,\" said Dick. \"I never was in the  station-house before; but I shall be lucky if I don't get sent to a  worse place.\"    \"Have you any idea who took the wallet which was found in your pocket?\"    \"No,\" said Dick.    \"Do you know a boy called Micky Maguire?\" proceeded Mr. Murdock.    \"Yes,\" said Dick, looking up in surprise. \"Micky used to be a great  friend of mine. He'd be delighted if he only knew that I was enjoyin'  the hospitality of the government.\"    \"He does know it,\" said Mr. Murdock, quietly.    \"How do you know?\" asked Dick, quickly.    \"Because it was he that stole the wallet and put it in your pocket.\"    \"How did you find out?\" asked Dick, eagerly.    \"Do you know a boy named Tim Ryan?\"    \"Yes; he's a good boy.\"    \"It was he that brought me your note. He saw the whole proceeding.\"    \"Why didn't he tell, and stop my bein' arrested, then?\"    \"I asked him that; but he said he was afraid Micky would beat him when  he found out. But he is a friend of yours, and he stands ready to  testify what he knows, at your trial, to-morrow morning.\"    \"That's lucky,\" said Dick, breathing a sigh of relief. \"So it was Micky  that served me the trick. He always loved me like a brother, Micky did,  but I didn't expect he'd steal for my benefit. I'm very much obliged to  him, but I'd rather dispense with such little favors another time.\"    \"You will be surprised to learn that Micky came round to our store this  afternoon.\"    \"What for?\" questioned Dick, in amazement.    \"I don't know whether he came by accident or design; but Mr. Gilbert  employed him to black his boots.\"    \"Mr. Gilbert!\"    \"Yes. They seemed to be conversing earnestly; but I was too far off to  hear what was said. Finally, Gilbert appeared to get angry, and drove  the boy out.\"    \"That's strange!\" said Dick, thoughtfully. \"Mr. Gilbert loves me about  as much as Micky does.\"    \"Yes, there seems to be some mystery about it. We may find out some time  what it is. But here is your friend Fosdick.\"    \"How are you, Fosdick?\" hailed Dick from his cell. \"I'm holdin' a little  levee down here. Did you receive my card of invitation?\"    \"I've been uneasy all the afternoon, Dick,\" said Fosdick. \"Ever since I  heard that you were here, I've been longing to come and see you.\"    \"Then you aint ashamed of me, even if I am in the station-house?\"    \"Of course I know you don't deserve to be here. Tell me all about it. I  only got a chance to speak a minute with Tim Ryan, for there were  customers waiting.\"    \"I'll tell you all I know myself,\" said Dick. \"I'm sorry to keep you  standing, but the door is locked, and I've accidentally lost the key. So  I can't invite you into my parlor, as the spider invited the fly.\"    \"Don't stand on ceremony, Dick. I'd just as lieves stay outside.\"    \"So would I,\" said Dick, rather ruefully.    The story was told over again, with such new light as Mr. Murdock had  been able to throw upon it.    \"It's just like Micky,\" said Fosdick. \"He's a bad fellow.\"    \"It was rather a mean trick,\" said Dick; \"but he hasn't had a very good  bringin' up, or maybe he'd be a better boy.\"    That he should have spoken thus, at the moment when he was suffering  from Micky's malice, showed a generosity of feeling which was  characteristic of Dick. No one was more frank, open, or free from malice  than he, though always ready to stand up for his rights when he  considered them assailed. It is this quality in Dick, joined to his  manly spirit, which makes him a favorite with me, as he is also with  you, let me hope, young reader.    \"It'll come out right, Dick,\" said Fosdick, cheerfully. \"Tim Ryan's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#17)"],[1,"character, had fitted him to watch the course of events in which,  according to the course of nature, he might be expected so soon to  take chief part. But the years which made his sire venerable passed,  and still he had no opportunity to shape public affairs. Absolutism  feared his influence and that of his liberal and strong-minded English  wife. The prime of life was his; but his best years were behind and  not before him as at the age of fifty-five he filially and devotedly  filled his own place, the loved and loving son of his Imperial father,  whose trusted representative he was on all courtly occasions, the  model husband and father, the accomplished and interested patron of  art and letters, the polished gentleman, the benevolent and devout  Christian. During his last winter of health (1886-1887) he was often  to be seen among the people. Accompanied by the Crown Princess and  their three unmarried daughters, he walked out and in, along the Unter  den Linden, an interested participator, like any other father of a  family, in the Christmas shopping. On one of the culminating days of  the great Reichstag debate, it was Prince William who was seen in the  Imperial box in the Parliament House, while \"Unser Fritz\" with wife  and daughters were skaters among the crowds on the ice-ponds of the  Thiergarten. This by no means indicated indifference to great  questions of public concern. None knew better the issue, the times,  and the need. But, standing all his mature life with his foot on the  threshold of a throne, with talents and training fitting him to do  honor to his royal line, to his Fatherland, and to the brotherhood of  kings in all lands and ages, he yet knew that while the father  reigned, it was not for the son to reign. He was to bide his time.  Alas! an inscrutable Providence made that time to be crowned only with  the halo of a dawning immortality, a time in which strength and peace  were to be radiated from one anointed by the chrism of pain, and  whose diadem was to shine, not among the treasures of earth, but as  the stars for ever and ever. When the messenger of the fallen Napoleon  III. had brought his unexpected surrender after Sedan, and the flush  of startling victory had mantled even the cheek of the pale and  reticent Von Moltke, had shaken the leonine composure of Bismarck, and  affected the heroic William I. almost to tears, the courtly Frederick  forgot himself and the victory of the cause he had helped to win, in  sympathy for the vanquished foe. The embarrassed general who brought  the surrender of the French had Frederick's instant devotion, and  those first moments of deep humiliation were soothed by the  conversation of the Crown Prince and by kind attentions which all  others forgot to render. With a truth and devotion to his country  which could never be doubted or questioned, he yet had a heart \"so  much at leisure from itself\" that in the supremest moments of life he  sympathized with friend and foe, as only regal souls can do.    I saw this foremost prince of Europe in the nineteenth century always  and increasingly to admire him, whether in the largest or the  smallest relations of life; whether as royal host entertaining the  sovereigns of Europe and their representatives when that magnificent  assemblage came to greet the ninetieth birthday of his father; dashing  on horseback through the streets of the capital and the riding-paths  of the park; saluting with stately grace his Imperial sire, as he  alone entered the place where the Emperor sat; handing the Crown  Princess to her seat, or going down on his knees to find her Imperial  Highness's misplaced footstool in her pew at church; accompanying his  daughters to places of public amusement and looking upon them with  manly tenderness; or standing with military helmet before his face in  silent prayer, as he entered the house of God to worship before the  King of kings.    My last sight of his Imperial Highness was on one of the latest  occasions of his public appearance in Berlin while in health, in  connection with one of those opportunities of hearing grand music in  which this city excels the rest of the world. It was that most  devotional music ever written,--Bach's Passion Music, rendered once a  year, on the evening of Good Friday, in the Sing Akademie of Berlin.  There was a trained chorus of about four hundred voices, with the  best orchestra in the city, besides solo singers of repute,--one, a  charming alto from Cologne. The simple and touching narrative of the  Betrayal and the Crucifixion was sung as it is written in the  twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh chapters of Matthew, certain phrases  and sentences repeated and adapted to the music, but none of it  essentially changed in form. One of the bass soloists took, with the  tenor, the soprano and the alto alternating, most of the narrative;  and another bass solo took the words of Jesus, whenever these occur in  the sad story. The _arias_ and _recitatives_ were finely given, but no  effect was comparable to that of the grand chorus. The single word  \"Barabbas!\" sung, or rather shouted, by these hundreds of voices in  perfect time and tune, was overwhelming. Another passage of most  thrilling effect was that in which every instrument and every voice  joined in the deafening but harmonious description of the multitude  who went out with swords and staves in the midnight, to take the  unoffending Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. And one could almost  hear in the music the sobbing of Peter when, after his denial of the  Lord, \"he went out and wept bitterly.\" Another most touching passage  was that representing the love of the woman who anointed the feet of  Jesus. When the shout of the multitude arose in the words \"Crucify  Him!\" the awfulness was intense. There were times when the audience  scarcely seemed to breathe freely, so strong was the spell, so vivid  the reality of this saddest and most touching of narratives, as  interpreted by this wonderful music. Never but once have I heard the  perfection of choral music. It was one of the grand and solemn ancient  hymn-tunes which are introduced at certain stages of this composition.  I closed my eyes to the brilliance of the scene before me, that the  ear might be the sole avenue of impression. Not the slightest jar or  dissonance revealed any difference in the four hundred voices speaking  as one; there seemed but one great soul pouring forth the vast volume  of the harmony. The mighty cadences rose and fell, breaking in waves  of sound against walls and roof, and must have floated far out into  the night, now soaring in triumph, now sweet and soft and low as the  tones of an Eolian harp; but the voice of hundreds was only as the  voice of one. Three hours and more, with one brief intermission, we  listened, and lived as it were those last sad hours of the Life so  sacred and so majestic, so unutterably full of love. The end came,  when the stone was rolled against the sealed door of the sepulchre,  and the Roman watch was set. No hint of a resurrection was in the  music; but the singers sang, in closing, again and again, in varying  strains, \"Good-night, good-night, dear Jesus!\"    The audience, moved as it seemed by a common impulse, joined in that  last song. The Crown Prince, with the Crown Princess and their  daughters, and the Princess Christian, then on a visit to Berlin, were  in the royal box in the concert-room. With his family and his royal  visitors, Frederick, his voice already in the penumbra of a dim,  unknown, unforeseen, but fateful shadow, took up the strain. \"He sang  it through,\" said a friend to me, who knew him well, \"and I could see  that he was deeply touched.\" There we left the story, as almost  nineteen hundred years ago it was left, on that Friday evening in  Jerusalem, with the full light of the Paschal moon falling on the  closed and silent tomb, in the garden of Joseph of Arimathea.    Two days later, on the evening of Easter Sunday, the Crown Prince  united in the service of the English Church, with his family, in  celebrating the joyous anniversary of a sure resurrection, and during  the same week left Berlin in quest of rest and health. He came not  back until, before another Good Friday, \"Unser Fritz\" was Emperor of  Germany, and already walking through the Valley of that Shadow in  which he sorrowfully sung of his \"dear Jesus,\" one short year before.           *       *       *       *       *    Various estimates have been made of the talents and character of the  third of the three German Emperors of the year 1888, but the record  and the proof of all prophecies concerning William II. have yet to be  made. As Prince William we saw him with best opportunity in the  Imperial box at the Reichstag, where for three hours he listened  intently to the speeches of Bismarck, Von Moltke, and others. A fair  young man, in the heavily ornamented light blue uniform of his  regiment, to a casual observer his countenance bore neither the marks  of dissipation nor the signs of intellectual power and force of  character. But he was only in the late twenties, and \"there is time  yet.\" He is the idol of the army, and the devoted friend of Bismarck.  Not one of all the great concourse of dignitaries at the celebration  of the ninetieth birthday of William I. received such shouts of  adulation from the populace as those which rent the air when the State  carriage passed which bore the Prince and Princess William and their  three little sons. Of the Princess William, now Empress Augusta  Victoria, there was but one opinion. \"None will ever know the blessing  which the Princess William has been to our family,\" once said her  father-in-law, the Crown Prince Frederick. From the throne to the hut,  blessings followed her, a Christian lady, in faithfulness as wife,  mother, friend, and princess, worthy of her exalted place.
