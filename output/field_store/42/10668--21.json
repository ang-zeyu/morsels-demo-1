[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23403"],[0,"Special Report on Diseases of the Horse (#17)"],[1," lampas is a disease that very frequently exists. In fact whenever a  horse fails to eat, and if he does not exhibit very marked symptoms of a  severe illness, they say at once \"he has the lampas.\" It is almost  impossible to convince them to the contrary; yet it is not the case. It  may be put down, then, as an affliction of the stable-man's imagination  rather than of the horse's mouth.      STOMATITIS.    Stomatitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the mouth  and is produced by irritating medicines, feeds, or other substances. The  symptoms are swelling of the mouth, which is also hot and painful to the  touch; there is a copious discharge of saliva; the mucous membrane is  reddened, and in some cases vesicles or ulcers in the mouth are  observed. The treatment is simple, soft feed alone often being all that  is necessary. A bucket of fresh, cold water should be kept constantly in  the manger so that the horse may drink or rinse his mouth at will. In  some instances, it may be advisable to use a wash of chlorate of potash,  borax, or alum, about one-half ounce to a pint of water. Hay, straw, or  oats should not be fed unless steamed or boiled. A form of contagious  stomatitis, characterized by the formation within the mouth of small  vesicles, or blisters, sometimes occurs. In this disease the horse  should be isolated from other horses, and his stall, especially the feed  box, and his bit should be disinfected.      GLOSSITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE TONGUE).    Glossitis, or inflammation of the tongue, is very similar to stomatitis,  and mostly exists with it and is due to the same causes. Injuries to the  tongue may produce this simple inflammation of its covering membrane,  or, if severe, may produce lesions much more extensive, such as  lacerations, abscesses, etc. These latter would require surgical  treatment, but for the simpler forms of inflammation of the tongue the  treatment recommended for stomatitis should be followed.      SALIVATION (PTYALISM).    Ptyalism, or salivation, consists in an abnormal and excessive secretion  of saliva. This is often seen as a symptom of irregular teeth;  inflammation of the mouth or tongue, or of the use of such medicines as  lobelia, mercury, and many others. Some feeds, such as clover, and  particularly second crop, produce it; foreign bodies, such as nails,  wheat chaff, and corncobs becoming lodged in the mouth, also are causes.  If the cause is removed no further attention is necessary, as a rule.  Astringent washes may be applied to the mouth as a gargle or by means of  a sponge.      PHARYNGITIS.    Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining of the  pharynx or throat. It rarely exists unless accompanied with stomatitis  or laryngitis, especially the latter. In those rare instances in which  the inflammation is mostly confined to the pharynx are noticed febrile  symptoms--difficulty of swallowing either liquids or solids; there is  but little cough except when trying to swallow; there is no soreness on  pressure over larynx (head of the windpipe). Increased flow of saliva,  difficulty of swallowing liquids in particular, and cough only when  attempting to swallow, are the symptoms best marked in pharyngitis. In  some cases the throat becomes gangrenous and the disease ends in death.  For treatment a wet sheet should be wrapped around the throat and  covered with rubber sheeting and a warm blanket. This should be changed  three times daily; or the region of the throat may be rubbed with  mercurial ointment twice daily until the skin becomes irritated, but no  longer; chlorate of potash may be given in 2-dram doses four times  daily, mixed with flaxseed meal or licorice-root powder and honey, as an  electuary. Soft feeds should be given, and fresh water should be  constantly before the horse.      PARALYSIS OF THE PHARYNX.    Paralysis of the pharynx, or, as it is commonly called, \"paralysis of  the throat,\" is a rare but very serious disease. The symptoms are as  follows: The horse will constantly try to eat or drink, but will be  unable to do so; if water is offered him from a pail he will apparently  drink with avidity, but the quantity of water in the pail will remain  about the same; he will continue by the hour to try to drink; if he can  get any fluid into the back part of the mouth it will come out at once  through the nose. Feeds also return through the nose, or are dropped  from the mouth, quidded. An examination of the mouth by inserting the  hand fails to find any obstruction or any abnormal condition. These  cases go on from bad to worse; the horse constantly and rapidly loses in  condition, becomes very much emaciated, the eyes are hollow and  lusterless, and death occurs from inanition.    Treatment is very unsatisfactory. A severe blister should be applied  behind and under the jaw; the mouth is to be frequently swabbed out with  alum or chlorate of potash, 1 ounce to a pint of water, by means of a  sponge fastened to the end of a stick. Strychnia may be given in 1-grain  doses two or three times a day.    This disease may be mistaken at times for foreign bodies in the mouth or  for the so-called cerebrospinal meningitis. It is to be distinguished  from the former, upon a careful examination of the mouth, by the absence  of any offending body and by the flabby feel of the mouth, and from the  latter by the animal appearing in perfect health in every particular  except this inability to eat or drink.      ABSCESSES.    Abscesses sometimes form back of the pharynx and give rise to symptoms  resembling those of laryngitis or distemper. Interference with breathing  that is of recent origin and progression, without any observable  swelling or soreness about the throat, will make one suspect the  formation of an abscess in this location. But little can be done in the  way of treatment, save to hurry the ripening of the abscess and its  discharge by steaming with hops, hay, or similar substances and by  poulticing the throat. The operation for opening an abscess in this  region necessitates an intimate knowledge of the complex anatomy of the  throat region.      DISEASES OF THE ESOPHAGUS OR GULLET.    It is rare to find diseases of this organ, except as a result of the  introduction of foreign bodies too large to pass or to the administering  of irritating medicines. In the administration of irritant or caustic  medicines great care should be taken that they be thoroughly diluted. If  this is not done, erosions and ulcerations of the throat ensue, and this  again is prone to be followed by constriction (narrowing) of the gullet.      CHOKING.    The mechanical trouble of choking is quite common. It may occur when the  animal is suddenly startled while eating apples or roots, and we should  be careful never to approach suddenly or put a dog after horses or cows  that are feeding upon such substances. If left alone these animals very  rarely attempt to swallow the object until it is sufficiently  masticated.    Choking also arises from feeding oats in a deep, narrow manger to such  horses as eat very greedily or bolt their feed. Wheat chaff is also a  frequent cause of choke. This accident may result from the attempts to  force eggs down without breaking or from giving balls that are too large  or not of the proper shape.    Whatever object causes the choking, it may lodge in the upper part of  the esophagus, at its middle portion, or close to the stomach, giving  rise to the designations of pharyngeal, cervical, and thoracic choke. In  some cases where the original obstruction is low we find all that part  of the gullet above it to be distended with feed.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms vary somewhat according to the position of the  body causing choke. In pharyngeal choke the object is lodged in the  upper portion of the esophagus. The horse will present symptoms of great  distress, hurried breathing, frequent cough, excessive flow of saliva,  sweating, trembling, or stamping with the fore feet. The abdomen rapidly  distends with gas. The diagnosis is completed by manipulating the upper  part of the throat from without and by the introduction of the hand into  the back part of the mouth, finding the body lodged here. In cervical  choke (where the obstruction is situated at any point between the  throatlatch and the shoulder) the protrusion caused by the object can be  seen and the object can be felt. The symptoms here are not so severe;  the horse will be seen occasionally to draw himself up, arch his neck,  and make retching movements as though he wished to vomit. The abdomen  may be tympanitic. Should there be any question as to the trouble, a  conclusion may be reached by pouring water into the throat from a  bottle. If the obstruction is complete, by standing on the left side of  the horse and watching the course of the esophagus, you can see the  gullet, just above the windpipe, become distended with each bottle of  water. This is not always a sure test, as the obstruction may be an  angular body, in which case liquids would pass it. Solids taken would  show in these cases; solids should not, however, be given, as they serve  to increase the trouble by rendering the removal of the body more  difficult.    In thoracic choke the symptoms are less severe. Feed or water may be  ejected through the nose or mouth after the animal has taken a few  swallows. There will be some symptoms of distress, fullness of the  abdomen, cough, and occasionally retching movements. Sometimes a choking  horse is heard to emit groans. The facial expression always denotes  great anxiety and the eyes are bloodshot. The diagnosis is complete if,  upon passing the probang (a flexible tube made for this purpose), an  obstruction is encountered.    _Treatment._--If the choke is at the beginning of the gullet  (pharyngeal) an effort must be made to remove the obstacle through the  mouth.

You did not doubt me a few hours ago.        _Sar._ Your courage never--nor your love till now;      And none could make me doubt it save yourself.      Those words----        _Myr._            Were words. I pray you, let the proofs      Be in the past acts you were pleased to praise      This very night, and in my further bearing,                        500      Beside, wherever you are borne by fate.        _Sar._ I am content: and, trusting in my cause,      Think we may yet be victors and return      To peace--the only victory I covet.      To me war is no glory--conquest no      Renown. To be forced thus to uphold my right      Sits heavier on my heart than all the wrongs[aj]      These men would bow me down with. Never, never      Can I forget this night, even should I live      To add it to the memory of others.                                 510      I thought to have made mine inoffensive rule      An era of sweet peace 'midst bloody annals,      A green spot amidst desert centuries,      On which the Future would turn back and smile,      And cultivate, or sigh when it could not      Recall Sardanapalus' golden reign.      I thought to have made my realm a paradise,      And every moon an epoch of new pleasures.      I took the rabble's shouts for love--the breath      Of friends for truth--the lips of woman for                        520      My only guerdon--so they are, my Myrrha:             [_He kisses her_.

Her transient weakness has passed o'er; at least,      It settled into tearless silence: her      Pale face and glittering eye, after a glance      Upon her sleeping children, were still fixed      Upon the palace towers as the swift galley      Stole down the hurrying stream beneath the starlight;              540      But she said nothing.        _Sar._                Would I felt no more      Than she has said!        _Sal._             'Tis now too late to feel.      Your feelings cannot cancel a sole pang:      To change them, my advices bring sure tidings      That the rebellious Medes and Chaldees, marshalled      By their two leaders, are already up      In arms again; and, serrying their ranks,      Prepare to attack: they have apparently      Been joined by other Satraps.        _Sar._                        What! more rebels?
