There, I mustn't stop.\"    He hurried down, closing and fastening the trap, and Jem pointed to the  food.    \"Eat away, Mas' Don, and work same time.  Strikes me we sha'n't go  aboard afore close upon daylight, for they've got us all shut up here  snug, so as no one shall know, and they don't dare take us away while  people can see.  Strikes me they won't get all the men aboard this time,  eh, Mas' Don?\"    \"Not if we can prevent it,\" said Don, with his hand upon the rough piece  of sacking which covered his share of the work.  \"Think it's safe to  begin again?\"    \"Ay!  Go on.  Little at a time, my lad, and be ready to hide it as soon  as you hears a step.\"    In spite of their trouble, they ate with a fair appetite, sharpened  perhaps by the hope of escape, and the knowledge that they must not be  faint and weak at the last moment.    The meal was finished, and all remaining silent, they worked on  unravelling the sacking, and rolling up the yarn, Don thinking of home,  and Jem whistling softly a doleful air.    \"If we don't get away, Mas' Don,\" he said, after a pause, \"and they take  us aboard ship and make sailors of us--\"    \"Don't talk like that, Jem!  We must--we will get away.\"    \"Oh, yes, it's all very well to talk, Mas' Don, but it's as well to be  prepared for the worst.  Like as not we sha'n't get away, and then we  shall go aboard, be made sailors, and have to fight the French.\"    \"I shall not believe that, Jem, till it takes place.\"    \"I shall, my lad, and I hope when I'm far away as your mother, as is a  reg'lar angel, will do what's right by my Sally, as is a married woman,  but only a silly girl after all, as says and does things without  thinking what they mean.  I was horrid stupid to take so much notice of  all she said, and all through that I'm here.\"    \"Haven't we got enough ready, Jem?\" said Don, impatiently, for his  companion's words troubled him.  They seemed to fit his own case.    \"Yes, I should think that will do now, sir, so let's begin and twist up  a rope.  We sha'n't want it very thick.\"    \"But we shall want it very strong, Jem.\"    \"Here goes, then, to make it,\" said Jem, taking the balls of yarn,  knotting the ends together, and then taking a large piece of sack and  placing it beside him.    \"To cover up the stuff if we hear any one coming, my lad.  Now then, you  pay out, and I'll twist.  Mustn't get the yarn tangled.\"    Don set to work earnestly, and watched his companion, who cleverly  twisted away at the gathered-up yarn, and then rolled his work up into a  ball.    The work was clumsy, but effective, and in a short time he had laid up a  few yards of a very respectable line, which seemed quite capable of  bearing them singly.    Foot by foot the line lengthened, and the balls of yarn grew less, when  just in the middle of their task Don made a dash at Jem, and threw down  the yarn.    \"Here, what yer doing?  You'll get everything in a tangle, sir.\"    \"Hush!  Some one coming.\"    \"I can't hear him.\"    \"There is, I tell you.  Listen!\"    Jem held his head on one side like a magpie, and then shook it.    \"Nobody,\" he said; but hardly had he said the words than he dabbed the  rope under him, and seized upon the yarn, threw some of the old sacks  upon it, and then laid his hand on Don's shoulder, just as the trap-door  was raised softly a few inches, and a pair of eyes appeared at the broad  crack.    Then the trap made a creaking noise, and a strange sailor came up, to  find Jem seated on the floor tailor-fashion, and Don lying upon his  face, with his arms crossed beneath his forehead, and some of the old  sacking beneath him.    The man came up slowly, and laid the trap back in a careful way, as if  to avoid making a noise, and then, after a furtive look at Jem, who gave  him a sturdy stare in return, he stood leaning over the opening and  listening.    Footsteps were heard directly after, and a familiar voice gave some  order.  Directly after the bluff-looking man with whom they had had so  much dealing stepped up into the loft.    \"Well, my lads,\" he said, \"how are the sore places?\"    Jem did not answer.    \"Sulky, eh?  Ah, you'll soon get over that.  Now, my boy, let's have a  look at you.\"    He gave Don a clap on the shoulder, and the lad started up as if from  sleep, and stared at the fresh comer.    \"Won't do,\" said the bluff man, laughing.  \"Men don't wake up from sleep  like that.  Ah!  Of course: now you are turning red in the face.  Didn't  want to speak to me, eh?  Well, you are all right, I see.\"    Don did not attempt to rise from where he half sat, half lay, and the  man gave a sharp look round, letting his eyes rest; for a few moments  upon the window, and then turning them curiously upon the old sacking.    To Don's horror he approached and picked up a piece close to that which  served for a couch.    \"How came all this here?\" he said sharply.    \"Old stuff, sir.  Been used for the bales o' 'bacco, I s'pose,\" said the  furtive-looking man.    \"Humph.  And so you have made a bed of it, eh?  Let's have a look.\"    The perspiration stood on Don's forehead.    \"Well,\" said the bluff man, \"why don't you get up?  Quick!\"    He took a step nearer Don, and was in the act of stooping to take him by  the arm, when there was a hail from below.    \"Ahoy!\" shouted the sailor, bending over the trap-door.    \"Wants Mr Jones,\" came up.    \"Luff wants you, sir,\" said the man.    \"Right.  There, cheer up, my lads; you might be worse off than you are,\"  said the bluff visitor pleasantly.  Then, clapping Don on the shoulder,  \"Don't sulk, my lad.  Make the best of things.  You're in the king's  service now, so take your fate like a man.\"    He nodded and crossed to the trap.    \"Ahoy, there!  Below there!  I'm coming.--Can't expect a bosun to break  his neck.\"    He said these last words as his head and shoulders were above the floor,  and gave the prisoners a friendly nod just as his eyes were  disappearing.    \"Come along, my lad,\" he said, when he was out of sight.    \"Ay!  Ay!\" growled the furtive-looking man, slowly following, and giving  those he left behind a very peculiar smile, which he lengthened out in  time and form, till he was right down the ladder, with the trap-door  drawn over and resting upon his head.  This he slowly lowered, till only  his eyes and brow were seen, and he stayed like that watching for a  minute, then let the lid close with a _flap_, and shut him, as it were,  in a box.    \"Gone!\" said Jem.  \"Lor', how I should ha' liked to go and jump on that  there trap just while he was holding it up with his head.  I'd ha' made  it ache for him worse than they made mine.\"    \"Hist!  Don't talk so loud,\" whispered Don.  \"He listens.\"    \"I hope he's a-listening now,\" said Jem, loudly; \"a lively smiling sort  of a man.  That's what he is, Mas' Don.  Sort o' man always on the blue  sneak.\"  Don held up his hand.    \"Think they suspect anything, Jem?\" he whispered.    \"Sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't, Mas' Don.  That stoutish chap  seemed to smell a rat, and that smiling door-knocker fellow was all on  the spy; but I don't think he heared anything, and I'm sure he didn't  see.  Now, then, can you tell me whether they're coming back?\"    Don shook his head, and they remained thinking and watching for nearly  an hour before Jem declared that they must risk it.    \"One minute,\" said Don; and he went on tip-toe as far as the trap-door,  and lying down, listened and applied his eyes to various cracks, before  feeling convinced that no one was listening.    \"Why, you didn't try if it was fastened,\" cried Jem; and taking out his  knife, he inserted it opposite to the hinges, and tried to lever up the  door.    It was labour in vain, for the bolt had been shot.    \"They don't mean to let us go, Mas' Don,\" said Jem.  \"Come on, and let's  get the rope done.\"    They returned to the sacking, lifted it up, and taking out the  unfinished rope, worked away rapidly, but with the action of sparrows  feeding in a road--one peck and two looks out for danger.    Half-a-dozen times at least the work was hidden, some sound below  suggesting danger, while over and over again, in spite of their efforts,  the rope advanced so slowly, and the result was so poor, that Don felt  in despair of its being done by the time they wanted it, and doubtful  whether if done it would bear their weight.    He envied Jem's stolid patience and the brave way in which he worked,  twisting, and knotting about every three feet, while every time their  eyes met Jem gave him an encouraging nod.    Whether to be successful or not, the making of the rope did one thing--  it relieved them of a great deal of mental strain.    In fact, Don stared wonderingly at the skylight, as it seemed to him to  have suddenly turned dark.    \"Going to be a storm, Jem,\" he said.  \"Will the rain hurt the rope?\"    \"Storm, Mas' Don?  Why, it's as clear as clear.  Getting late, and us  not done.\"    \"But the rope must be long enough now.\"    \"Think so, sir?\"    \"Yes; and if it is not, we can easily drop the rest of the way.\"    \"What!  And break our legs, or sprain our ankles, and be caught?  No  let's make it another yard or two.\"    \"Hist!  Quick!\"    They were only just in time, for almost before they had thrown the old  sacking over the rope, the bolt of the trap-door was thrust back, and  the sinister-looking sailor entered with four more, to give a sharp look  round the place, and then roughly seize the prisoners.    \"Now, then!\" cried Jem sharply, \"what yer about?  Arn't going to tie us  up, are you?\"    \"Yes, if you cut up rough again,\" said the leader of the little party.  \"Come on.\"    \"Here, what yer going to do?\" cried Jem.    \"Do?  You'll see.  Not going to spoil your beauty, mate.\"    Don's heart sank low.  All that hopeful labour over the rope thrown  away!  And he cast a despairing look at Jem.    \"Never mind,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#17)"],[1,"ater-carts were old butts upon wheels, drawn by sorry  horses and driven by fat old creatures, half men half women in their  attire and manners.  The buckets were made of leather and the water was  sold at a halfpenny per Hessian.  They were so called, I believe, from  their fancied resemblance to the Hessian boots.  You may judge how  inadequate a supply of water we had when our wants were dependent upon  such aid.  The water-carts came rumbling and tumbling along the streets,  in many cases losing one-half of their loads by the unusual speed at  which they were driven and the awkwardness of their drivers.  Water was  also carted from the river, and I helped with others to push the carts up  Water-street.  The steep ascent of this street in its badly paved  condition made this work extremely laborious.  But everybody helped and  did what they could, and those who did nothing made up for deeds by words  and shouted and bawled and told the others what they ought to do.    Fortunately, only one life was lost, that of a fool-hardy young man who  would press forward to see the fire better--he rushed up to the  High-street door and a piece of timber fell on him.  The surging of the  crowd caused several persons to be struck down and trampled upon.  I  saved one woman's life by beating off the people who would have crushed  her.  By twelve o'clock the fire had slackened considerably, and by the  evening it was to all appearance subdued.  But the fire in the interior  remained smouldering for some time afterwards.  In the churches on that  day the event was alluded to in a very feeling manner, and in St. Peter's  Church the rector offered up a prayer of thanksgiving that the town had  been spared from a more extensive calamity.    At this time High-street (there was a famous tavern called the  \"Punch-Bowl\" in this street) was the communication between Castle-street  and Old Hall-street, and it is a most strange circumstance that the  direct line of road was not retained instead of cutting the new street  called Exchange-street East through the houses and gardens between  Tithebarn-street and Dale-street.  It was a great mistake, and everybody  said so at the time.  Many great mistakes have been made in respect to  our streets and public buildings, not the least of which was the blunder  of filling up the Old Dock, and erecting that huge and ugly edifice, the  Custom-house, thereon.    I believe if the conflagration had extended from the Exchange to some  distance in the adjoining streets, we should have had some vast  improvements effected.  From the narrowness of Castle-street may be  imagined what a scene of confusion it must have been during the fire.  It  is quite a wonder that many lives were not lost during that morning of  terror.  The inhabitants of the four streets in many cases prepared for  flight, for the fire raged so fiercely at one time that the escape of the  houses in the vicinity from destruction seemed miraculous.  While I was  helping to draw water from the yard of some people I knew in  Castle-street, a burning ember or piece of timber fell into a lot of  dirty paper which would in five minutes have been alight if I had not  been there to extinguish it.  There were many such wonderful escapes  recorded.    The trial of Mr. Charles Angus for the alleged murder of Miss Margaret  Burns (who was his late wife's half-sister) in 1808, may be considered as  one of the _causes celebres_ of the time.  It took place at Lancaster, on  the 2nd of September, before Sir Alan Chambre.  Sergeant Cockle, and  Messrs. Holroyd, Raine and Clark, were for the Crown; Mr. T. Statham,  attorney.  Messrs. Topping, Scarlett, and Cross for the prisoner; Mr.  Atkinson, attorney.  Mr. Angus was a gentleman of Scotch birth, and  resided in Liverpool--in King-street, I think.  He had been at one time  an assistant to a druggist, where he was supposed to have obtained a  knowledge of the properties of poisons, and he was charged with putting  this knowledge to account in attempting to produce abortion in the case  of Miss Burns, who was suspected of being pregnant by him, and thereby  causing her death.  Miss Burns was Mr. Angus's housekeeper, and governess  to his three children.  The case rested entirely on circumstantial  evidence, made out against the prisoner by his conduct previous to the  supposed commission of the deed, by his conduct at the time and  afterwards.  At the time the strongest prejudice ran against Mr. Angus,  and it must be said that the public were not satisfied with the verdict  of the jury; but at this distance of time, those who had an opportunity  of looking over the evidence, and remembering the case in all its  bearings, will at once say dispassionately that there was not a shadow of  evidence against Mr. Angus.  Miss Burns, who had been unwell for some  time, was noticed previous to the 23rd of March, 1808, to be ailing, and  that her size had materially enlarged; and it was suspected, as adduced  by several witnesses, that she was _enceinte_.  On the 23rd of March she  complained of being very unwell, and went to lie down on a sofa in the  breakfast-room where she remained the whole of the day, thirsting and  vomiting.  Mr. Angus would not allow his servants to sit up with Miss  Burns, but remained in the room with her the whole of that night, the  next day, and the following night.  On the 25th Miss Burns said she felt  better.  A servant on that morning was sent to Henry-street for some  Madeira that Miss Burns fancied.  On her return, not seeing the lady on  the sofa, where an hour previous she had left her, she looked round the  room and discovered her doubled up in a corner of the room with her face  towards the wainscot, while Mr. Angus was asleep sitting in a chair  covered by a counterpane.  The evidence was most conflicting.  Several  witnesses declared Miss Burns was not pregnant, others that they believed  she was.  The medical evidence was also of a most bewildering and diverse  nature.  Some of the most eminent surgeons in Liverpool were examined,  and none of them agreed on the case.  This fact came out that no signs of  childbirth were visible as having taken place--no dead infant was  discovered.  The room in which Miss Burns and Mr. Angus were, was at all  times accessible to the servants, and no cries of parturition were heard  during the lady's illness.  The fact of the matter was, Miss Burns had  suffered from an internal complaint, and died from natural causes.  This  was shown by Dr. Carson, then a young and rising physician at the time,  and who afterwards published a pamphlet in which he utterly demolished  the medical evidence given at the trial for the crown.    The jury, after a few minutes' deliberation, returned a verdict, finding  the prisoner \"Not Guilty,\" on grounds as unimpeachable as the trial.  In  some of the circumstances attending and resulting from it, it was  disgraceful, especially on the part of the medical witnesses for the  crown, in their conduct towards the one for the defence--Dr. Carson.  I  have before me an authentic \"Report of the Trial,\" \"A Vindication of  their Opinions,\" published by those witnesses, and Dr. Carson's \"Remarks\"  on that publication, in which he exposes their shortcomings with a  master's hand, in a style as terse as it is bold, and as elegant as it is  severe; never were the weapons of irony, satire, and invective more  effectively used; his impeachment is as withering as his victory at the  trial was complete.  The authors of the \"Vindications\" had not only done  what in them lay to ruin him in every conceivable way, public and  private, but they had exposed themselves to his \"Remarks,\" all-pungent as  they were, by going into court and giving opinions founded upon \"the most  disgracefully deficient dissection ever made.\"  The sore which they had  inflicted upon themselves at the trial did not heal under the caustic of  the \"Remarks\"; and so the doctor became a victim to local prejudice,  passion, and persecution.  But he gained to himself a world-wide  reputation which outlived them all; the honours of the French Academy  were bestowed upon him, and he took his stand among the literary and  scientific magnates of the day.  As to the trial, the theory of the  prosecution was that the prisoner caused the lady's death by  administering a poison to procure abortion, and it was based upon a hole  in the coats of the stomach, and a peculiar mark in the uterus; the  medical witnesses for the crown affirming that the former could not have  arisen from any other known cause than poison, and the latter a sure sign  of recent delivery.  No poison was found in the stomach or intestines,  nor were the supposed contents of the uterus ever found, and no other  part of the body was examined.  The hole in the stomach presented the  same appearance, and was described in the same terms as those which John  Hunter had called attention to as occurring in certain cases of sudden  death, where there was no suspicion of poisoning, and caused by the  action of the gastric juice.  Doctor Carson accepted Hunter's facts, but  propounded a theory of his own, being guided to his conclusions by the  experiments of Sir John Pringle and Dr. Bride, in reference to water at  the temperature of 90 degrees dissolving animal substances.  He  successfully combated the notion about poisoning from another point of  view, namely, the symptoms during life, the comparative mildness of which  did not correspond with the usual effects of the poison fixed upon.  As  to the mark in the uterus, he gave his opinion that it might have arisen  from other causes than the one alleged; two phenomena were absent, and  upon this fact he asserted it to be physically impossible that there  could have been a recent delivery; and, moreover, in his \"Remarks,\" he  proved mathematically that the mark was four times the size it ought to  have been on that hypothesis.  Miss Burns had not"]]]
