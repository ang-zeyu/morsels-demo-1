It was God that made him--God knows best.\"    In truth, there is no answer to this question--\"Whither?\" And thus it is  that we are compelled to leave it according to our habit when we are at  fault, and much as the poet leaves it here. In the case of the man, we  think we understand. In that of the dog, our difficulty appears to defy  solution: it is no question of argument, assertions are idle, dogma has  no place. On the one hand we have those principles that come to man's  aid, but of which it would be unbecoming now to speak. The vast majority  of Christian men are enabled to ride out the storms of life without  confidence wholly giving way, and with the first of sheet-anchors fixed  in what is felt to be the best of holding ground. When, however, we turn  to the possible future status of the dog, there is no sheet-anchor, and  the holding ground is indifferent. Yet, in considering the case of the  man and the dog, we are not left without a certain measure of support  equally applicable to both. The spirit definable as the immediate  apprehension of the mind without reasoning--the spirit of intuition--aids  us on either hand. \"We are endued,\" as Bishop Butler tells us, \"with  capacities of perception\"; and these enable us to accept much that lies  outside the actual region of proof, because our inner consciousness tells  us that we are not altogether on a false track, and that truths, if half  hidden, yet, of a certainty, exist in the direction in which we are  making earnest search.    We necessarily suffer here, as always, from the tendency that makes the  wish the father to the thought; or, in other words, we not infrequently  shovel the unpalatable overboard, that we may lighten the ship, and ride  out this or that squall without quite so much strain upon the  sheet-anchor aforesaid. The majority of mankind believe, and will  continue to believe, most staunchly in what they wish to believe. Yet  this tendency on our part--visible as it often is in directions where we  should least expect to find it--does not necessarily prove our beliefs  false, while it also leads us not infrequently direct to truths, however  unorthodox our course may have appeared to lookers-on.    In considering, then, the question of the possible future existence of  our canine friends, the dominant feeling is commonly this: We believe  that a future, in great probability, exists for them, because we feel  that not to believe this would be to turn the whole scheme of the  universe, as we understand it, into one little short of nonsense. We do  not stop to reason: such things are because they must be; they cannot  cease to be without total disfigurement of the plan of our conception.  Intuition points, and almost impulsively perhaps, in one direction. There  is \"an intelligent Author of Nature or Natural Governor of the world.\"  Life is not made up of haphazards. Eventually there will be happiness in  completest form: otherwise there would be injustice, and of this, life,  as we know it, affords little or no evidence. For happiness to be  complete, there can be no question of the songs we are to hear being  indifferently harmonised, there can be no rifts in the lute: in a state  of perfection imperfections must necessarily be imperceptible.    With our narrow, human limitations we are driven to conclusions naturally  circumscribed and coloured by those limitations. We are cognisant of the  narrowness of the field of vision allowed us, and we are perpetually made  aware that we are beating our wings against the bars; but we nevertheless  accept this or that conclusion because it satisfies our souls, or we  refuse to accept it because we cannot honestly confess that it does so.  Yet, once again, behind both acceptance and rejection there is something  further--that intuition and power of perception that enable us to find  satisfaction in inferences that we know lie outside questions of faith,  but which we nevertheless feel to be true. And the very fact that we are  enabled to derive this satisfaction and to feel that our conclusions have  an element of truth in them tends to confirm us, rightly or wrongly, in  our conjectures.    Thus we come deliberately to the opinion that dogs will have a place in  the land over the border. Such an opinion may be a bold one; but there is  reason for believing that it is somewhat widely held. We naturally tend  to materialise when we build up our several pictures; but we sin here, if  at all, in the best of company. The city that lay foursquare, and that is  described to us in the vision in the Island of Patmos, was of pure gold,  with walls of jasper and gates of precious stones, and had within it  trees and birds and many divers animals, and material things of greatest  beauty, besides the figures of innumerable angels. The description could  not have been otherwise drawn if it was to be grasped by the mind of man,  even to a limited extent. So with ourselves. To conceive of a world with  all the attributes of beauty yet without flowers is impossible. To  realise a world full of music and song yet without birds may be possible,  but transcends the powers of most minds. To attempt to believe in the  happiness of a world where companionship is to be looked for and reunion  is promised, yet where the companionship of dogs is denied, is to strain  the belief of some to the uttermost and not improbably to fail.    \"Nor,\" writes Bishop Butler in his immortal treatise, \"can we find  anything throughout the whole analogy of nature to afford us even the  slightest presumption that animals ever lose their living powers; much  less, if it were possible, that they lose them by death: for we have no  faculties wherewith to trace any beyond or through it, so as to see what  becomes of them. This event removes them from our view. It destroys the  sensible proof, which we had before death, of their being possessed of  living powers, but does not appear to afford the least reason to believe  that they are, then, or by that event, deprived of them. And our knowing  that they were possessed of these powers, up to the very period to which  we have faculties capable of tracing them, is itself a probability of  their retaining them beyond it.\"    When Robert Southey looked for the last time on his old friend,  Phillis--and there is a bitter difference on such an occasion between  looking upon the young and the old--he tells how often in his earlier  days this dog and he had enjoyed childish sports together, and how, later  on, when hard times overtook him, he found delight in recalling the  faithful fondness of the friend in the distant home, and longed to feel  again the warmth of his dumb welcome. Then, when the old dog is at last  dead, and there has come a severance of these precious associations, he  breaks out with:                       \"Mine is no narrow creed;               And He who gave thee being did not frame               The mystery of life to be the sport               Of merciless man. There is another world               For all that live and move--a better one!               Where the proud bipeds, who would fain confine               Infinite goodness to the little bounds               Of their own charity, may envy thee!\"    When we turn to the first of all books, the dog certainly appears to  receive harsh treatment. The term \"dog\" is invariably one of reproach.  Goliath cursing David asks, \"Am I a dog?\" Abner exclaims, \"Am I a dog's  head?\" St. Paul refers to false prophets as dogs. In the Psalms the dog  is found to be synonymous with the devil; in the Gospels it stands for  unholy men. Evil-workers are dogs; a dog is the equivalent of a fool;  nothing is lower than a dog, and nothing is to be more abhorred. Finally,  there is that hardest sentence of all--\"Without are dogs\"; as though any  hope for dogs was entirely forbidden. It is the same throughout: the  depraved of mankind are dogs, and the very acme of possible reproach and  contempt is apparently to be found in the use of this one term. Abandon  hope;--without, are you who are dogs!    But is the use of this term \"dog\" to be taken literally? There seems to  be ample evidence that it should not be. The very extravagance of the  language raises a doubt at once, just as the grotesqueness of the  application of the term shows that the dog itself could never have been  meant. St. Paul speaks of false prophets as dogs because of their  impudence and love of gain--characteristics hardly to be attributed to  the animal itself. The term \"dead dog\" was the most opprobrious to which  a Jew could lay his tongue; when David endeavoured to convey to the mind  of Saul that the persecution to which he was subjecting him was a  dishonour to himself, he asked him whom he was pursuing; was he pursuing  \"after a dead dog\"? If, as Horace has it, \"death is the utmost boundary  of wealth and power,\" it is surely no less so of pursuit.    Then again, in the Psalms, David writes, \"Deliver my soul from the sword,  my darling from the power of the dog\"; in other words, the devil. All  dogs are not good dogs, though all dogs are good dogs to their respective  owners; but no dog can possibly be classed as we find him here, or as the  very image and likeness of the most depraved and debased of mankind as we  find him elsewhere. He is incapable of these sins; he does not fall into  these errors.    What we have to remember is apparently this. The earliest mention of the  dog in Scripture is in connection with the sojourn of the Israelites in  Egypt. The dog was declared by the Jewish law to be unclean; and it is  not improbable that the Jews were so taught to regard him in opposition  to those taskmasters who, they were well aware, held him sacred. Thus the  term dogs appears often as the reflection of a passionate and deep-seated  hatred, apart altogether from the animal's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],[0,"The Story of Leather (#17)"],[1,"the key put into Mr. Coddington's pocket.    As the hammering that had for so long echoed through the factory ceased  queries concerning the noise and the mission of the carpenters died  away. Even Peter himself forgot about the great mystery, for the ball  season was now on and in addition to its engrossing interests he and Nat  were transferred to Factory 3 where they became much absorbed in the  tanning of cowhides. Here again the preparation of the leather took them  back to the beamhouse with its familiar processes of liming, unhairing,  puering and tanning. Was there never to be an end to beamhouses, Peter  wondered.    \"No sooner do we get out of one and find ourselves happy at some clean,  decent work than off we go to another! I am about tired of beamhouses!\"  wailed Peter.    Nevertheless the two boys stuck resolutely to the beamhouse and to  tanning cowhides.    At Factory 3 there also were tanned other light weight hides that  underwent a chrome process of tannage rather than the oak or hemlock  processes used at the sole leather plant at Elmwood.    It seemed to Peter that he had never dreamed there were so many  creatures in the whole world until he began to handle the shipments of  hides that came to the factory to be tanned.    \"Do all these skins come from the ranches of our own country?\" he  inquired one day when, from the window, he saw a train of heavily laden  freight cars come rolling into the yard. \"Why, I shouldn't think there  would be a single live animal left in America.\"    \"There wouldn't,\" replied the boss good-naturedly. \"No, indeed. Only a  small part of the hides tanned here and at the Elmwood tanneries come  from our ranches. The United States cannot begin to produce hides enough  to fill the demand. Therefore we import a great many from abroad as well  as from South America. When a shipment arrives the skins are sorted: the  cowhides and those to be tanned in chrome coming here, and the heavy  skins and those to be tanned in oak or hemlock being sent on to Elmwood,  where all the sole leather is made. The hides vary in weight, ranging  from twenty-five to sixty pounds. There are skins of steers, horses,  buffaloes, walrus, bulls, and oxen. The strongest and most perfect ones  are made into belting to run the machinery of factories. Leather for  this purpose, as you can easily see, must be of equal strength in every  part to withstand the great strain put upon it. Some factories turn out  belting and nothing else. Other heavy hides are tanned into sole leather  for harnesses, bags, trunks, and the soles of shoes. Then there are lots  of hides which are not perfect. These are the skins of branded cattle  and steers. You know, of course, that on many of the ranches the stock  is branded so that it can be easily identified in case it is lost. These  branded hides have flaws or thin places in them and are not so valuable  in consequence.\"    \"I can see that,\" assented Peter. \"What is done with such leather?\"    \"Well, it is usually tanned in oak, or in a blend of oak and hemlock  known as union tan, and is sold for purposes where less strength will be  demanded of it than if it were made into belting.\"    Peter nodded.    \"Oh, there are lots of interesting things to learn about hides. Why, you  wouldn't believe, now would you, that the way the animals live would  make a difference in the weight of their skins? Yet it is so. Cattle  raised in stalls and supplied regularly with good food have far better  hides than those that range the fields and are forced to forage for the  scant rations found there. Wild cattle, on the other hand, have much  tougher hides than do domesticated animals.\"    \"It's curious, isn't it?\" replied Peter.    \"Yes, it is,\" the foreman answered. \"Two factors always go hand in hand  in the making of a fine leather. One is the quality of the hide itself;  and the other is the way in which it is tanned. For the tanning liquid,  you know, reacts on the fibres of the skin in such a way that the  material becomes tougher, closer grained, and more pliable. Here again  you are back to the importance of the beamhouse processes.\"    All these items of information Peter and Nat added to their accumulating  fund. Through the long summer they worked hard, classifying all they  learned and collecting more as one gathers up snow by rolling a  snowball.    Then came the fall, with its frosts of ever increasing heaviness. The  park flowers drooped; baseball failed to drive the cold from chilled  fingers; and lunching in the open had to be abandoned. It was then that  notices were posted in all the tanneries saying that at noon on a  certain day the president of the Coddington Company desired to meet his  men in the vacant room of Factory 2.    Peter's heart beat high!    At last the secret of the reading-room was to be made public!    Would the men like their new quarters, he wondered. What an absurd  speculation! Of course they would.    Yet it was not without some anxiety that, in company with Nat, Peter  made his way to Factory 2 the moment the noon whistle blew on that great  day. A tide of workmen moved hither with him. On every hand they poured  in through the doors and streamed up the stairways. The two boys  followed. Everybody was speculating as to what the president could want.  Then, as the vanguard of the crowd reached the fifth floor, Peter heard  a rush of sound--cheers and cries of surprise. The mystery, so long  guarded, stood revealed!    A lump rose in the lad's throat. The men were pleased, and his father,  who had spent so much time and money on the carrying out of this  project, would consider himself more than repaid for all he had done.  Poor Peter! He almost felt personally responsible that the men should  appreciate his father's kindness. So anxious had he been that had those  hundreds of voices not risen with just the spontaneity they did it would  have broken his heart. But the cheers swelled from the scores of throats  with a heartiness not to be questioned.    Silently he and Nat pushed their way into the crowded room. Far away in  the glow of a blazing fire Peter could see his father, wreathed in  smiles, talking with Mr. Tyler. And it was just at that moment that the  boy remembered about the picture which was to have been purchased and  raised his eyes curiously to the space over the fireplace. To his  chagrin the spot was covered with a piece of green cambric. The picture  his father had promised to buy had not come! For a fraction of a second  Peter sobered with disappointment; then in the excitement of the  cheering he forgot all about it.    In answer to shouts and cheers Mr. Coddington stepped forward and raised  his hand.    There was instant stillness.    \"It gives me great pleasure to see that you like the room,\" said he,  simply, \"and I am grateful to you for so heartily expressing your  approval. But before we go further I feel it is only honest to confess  to you that it is neither the Coddington Company nor myself that you  should thank for this new library. Shall I tell you how you chanced to  have it?\"    \"Yes! Yes!\" came from all over the room.    Then in humorous fashion Mr. Coddington sketched the tale of two boys  and an interrupted luncheon, drawing a vivid picture of how the lads had  been unceremoniously tumbled to the floor out of their stronghold in the  packing-boxes. Mr. Coddington had a gift for telling a story and he told  this one with consummate skill.    At its conclusion there was a general laugh.    \"Those boys are with us to-day,\" continued the president. \"They are not  strangers to you. One of them is Nat Jackson, whom you all know well,  and the other--the lad who furnished me with the inspiration for this  venture is----\"    Instantly the curtain over the fireplace was withdrawn.    \"Peter Strong!\" cried the men.    It was indeed Peter who smiled down on the throng from out the broad  gilt frame! Not Peter Coddington of the fashionable \"west side,\"--the  son and heir of the president of the company, but Peter Strong--Peter in  faded jumper and with the collar of his shirt turned away so that one  could see where the firm young head rose out of it; Peter with hair  tumbled, cheeks flushed from hard work, and his eyes shining as they  always shone when he was happy; Peter Strong--the Peter the men knew and  loved!    The boy himself looked on, bewildered. Well he knew the source of the  portrait. It had evidently been copied from a snap-shot Nat had taken of  him one day when the two were coming out of the beamhouse. His father's  delay in finding a suitable picture was also now explained. He had had  to wait for the portrait to be painted.    Nat, who was watching Peter's face with no small degree of amusement,  now whispered:    \"I kept one secret from you anyhow, Peter. Mr. Coddington came to see us  one evening last spring and asked if I had any kodak picture of you,  explaining what he wanted it for. So I let him look over what I had and  he chose this one. It's fine, isn't it?\"    \"Why, I don't know,\" stammered Peter. \"I--I'm so flabbergasted I----\"    Nat laughed.    All this time the men were cheering and now cries of \"Peter Strong!\"  \"Peter Strong!\" rent the air.    The unlucky Peter, who was vainly trying to flatten himself against the  wall and hide in Nat's shadow, was dragged forth by Carmachel and made  to stand upon a table, from which elevation he waved his hand to the men  and then, ducking suddenly, buried himself once more in the crowd.    After waiting a little while for the tumult to subside Mr. Coddington  again began to speak--this time in a low, uncertain voice:    \"I see you all recognize the portrait. It is Peter Strong as you have  met and known him. Yet we can never tell what the future will unfold. If  it chanced that time should bring to this lad a career fraught with  greater responsibilities than he now holds I want you to remember that  he came into the works a boy, like"]]]
