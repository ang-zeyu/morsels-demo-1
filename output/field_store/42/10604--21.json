We know the influence of the mind over the  body, and the pernicious effect which wrong ideas may exercise over  our feelings. The generally prevalent opinion among women, and men for  that matter, and not only of the laity but unfortunately of the  medical profession as well, is that the menopause is the end of  woman's sexual life. Every woman is laboring under the erroneous  impression that with the establishment of the menopause, with the  cessation of the menses, she ceases to be a woman, and as she does not  become a man, she becomes something of a neuter being, neither woman  nor man. And she has the idea that after the menopause she can have no  further attraction for her husband or for other men. Naturally such an  idea has a very depressing effect on any human being. Any human being  fights to the last to retain all its human functions, especially the  function which is considered as important as is the sexual function.    =Reproductive Function and Sexual Function Not Synonymous.= Of course  with the permanent cessation of the menses the woman's _reproductive_  function is at an end. But the reproductive function is _not_  synonymous with the sexual function, I must insist again and again,  and naturally until this erroneous idea is dispelled much unnecessary  misery will be the lot of our women. If women in general will learn  that with the establishment of the menopause they do _not_ cease to be  women, if they will learn that the sexual desire in women lasts long  beyond the cessation of the menopause, many women being as passionate  at sixty as at thirty, if they will learn that their attractiveness or  non-attractiveness to the male sex does not depend upon the menopause,  but upon their general condition, if they will learn that many women  at fifty and sixty are much more attractive than some women at half  that age, they will not take the onset of the menopause so tragically  and they will thereby avoid the greater part of their mental and  emotional suffering.    The actual atrophy of the ovaries, uterus, external genitals and the  breasts can, of course, not be prevented, but that atrophy is a slow  and gradual process, and is not in itself the cause of the various  distressing symptoms that we have enumerated.    The treatment of the menopause, if the symptoms are at all  disagreeable, or distressing, should be in the hands of a competent  physician. A little wholesome advice may be more efficient than  gallons of medicine and bushels of pills. In general the woman should  try to lead as calm and peaceful a life as possible. Warm baths daily  are beneficial, constipation should be guarded against, hot vaginal  douches are often efficient against the disagreeable flushes, and  last, but not least, the husband should during this critical period be  doubly kind and doubly considerate of his wife. It is during the years  between forty-five and fifty-five that the wife is most in need of her  husband's sympathy and support.    =Increased Libido During Menopause.= There is one rather delicate  symptom which I must not pass unmentioned. Some women during the years  while the menopause is being established, and for some years after the  menopause, experience a greatly heightened sexual desire. In some  cases this increased libido is normal, that is, no other pathologic  symptoms or local conditions can be discovered. In some cases the  increased libido is distinctly due to local congestion, congestion of  the ovaries, the uterus, etc. In some cases, I can distinctly testify,  it is psychic or autosuggestive. Because the woman thinks, and  believes that other people think, that she is soon going to lose all  her sexuality, she unconsciously works herself up into a sexual  passion which sometimes may be of long duration and may even lead to  disastrous results.    What to do in such cases? Where the woman's libido is normal or near  normal, then naturally it should be normally gratified. But if the  libido seems to be abnormally strong and the demands for sexual  gratification are too frequent, then the woman should be treated and  sexual gratification should not be indulged in, because in such cases,  as a rule, sexual gratification only adds fuel to the fire, and the  woman's demands may become more and more frequent, more and more  insistent. In exceptional cases it may even reach the intensity of  nymphomania. In such cases the aid of a tactful physician is  indispensable.      Change of Life in Men    To people not familiar with the subject it sounds rather strange to  speak of \"change of life\" in men.    Man, possessing no menstrual function, cannot have any menopause, but  still sexologists and psychologists who have studied the subject  carefully are convinced that between the ages of forty-five and  fifty-five men also undergo a certain change which may be spoken of as  the change of life or the male climacteric.    They become irritable, capricious, very susceptible to feminine  charms, are apt to fall in love, and in many the sexual instinct is  greatly increased. As in women, this increase of the sexual desire is  sometimes due to pathologic causes, such as an inflamed prostate  gland--in other cases it is of psychic origin.    Just as a man should be particularly kind and considerate to his wife  during her menopause, so the wife, understanding that her husband is  going through a critical period, will also increase her tact, patience  and consideration.          CHAPTER NINETEEN    THE HABIT OF MASTURBATION     Definition of Masturbation--Its Injurious Effects in Girls as    Compared with Boys--Married Life of the Girl Masturbator--    Necessity for Change in Injurious Attitude of Parents who Discover    the Habit--Common-sense Treatment of the Habit--How to Prevent    Formation of Habit--Parents' Advice to Children--Hot Baths as    Factor in Masturbation--Other Physical Factors--Mental    Masturbation and Its Effects.      Masturbation or self-abuse is a term applied to a bad habit which  consists in handling and rubbing the genitals. It is a bad habit  because it is apt to injure the health and future development of the  girl. The more frequently it is practiced, the more injurious it is.  It is more injurious than when practiced by boys, because the effects  are usually more permanent. Girls who indulge in the habit of  masturbation to excess not only weaken themselves, become anemic and  get a dingy, pimply complexion, but they lose their desire for normal  sexual relations when they grow up, and are unable to derive any  pleasure from the sexual act when they get married. In fact, many  girls who masturbated excessively get a strong aversion to the normal  sexual act, and their married life is an unhappy one. Their husbands  often have to ask for a divorce. Fortunately, the habit is much less  widespread among girls than it is among boys. While about ninety per  cent. of all boys--nine out of every ten--masturbate more or less,  only about ten or at most twenty per cent. of girls are addicted to  this habit. But whatever the percentage may be, the habit is an  injurious one, and if you value your health, your beauty and proper  growth and mental development, you should not indulge in it. If you  are already indulging, if you are used to handling your genitals, if a  bad companion has initiated you into the habit, you should give it up.  And mothers should watch their children, guard them against developing  the habit, and do everything possible to cure them of it, if  prevention comes too late.    But while as you see I do not deny the evil effects of masturbation,  it is necessary to state that a great change has taken place in our  opinions on the subject, and it is but right that parents should know  of this change of opinion among the medical profession, particularly  among those who specialize in sexology.    =Wrong Behavior of Parents.= When parents make the \"awful\" discovery  that their child is fondling its genitals or is indulging in  masturbation, they feel as if a great calamity had befallen them.  They could not feel worse if they learned that the child was a thief  or a pyromaniac. Imbued with the medieval idea of the \"sinfulness\" of  the habit, as well as its injuriousness, they begin to scold the  child, to frighten it, to make it believe that it is doing something  terrible, that it has disgraced them and itself; and they try to  persuade it that, unless it stops immediately, the most direful  consequences are awaiting it. The results of this mode of procedure  are disastrous--much more so than is the masturbation itself.    Often the scolding and the exposure of the child are done in the  presence of others. This implants in the poor girl a sullen resentment  that only makes it more difficult for it to break the habit. When the  child is brought to the physician, you can see by its behavior, by its  downcast looks, by its sulkiness, by its attempt to refrain from  tears, and other signs, that it regards the physician in exactly the  same light as a youthful criminal regards the judge before whom he has  been brought for trial.    It is time, high time, that this silly and injurious attitude toward a  practice, which is very common, be radically changed. It is time that  parents and physicians learn that the injuriousness of the habit has  been greatly, grossly exaggerated. It is time that they know that the  vast majority of boys and girls get over the habit without being much,  or any, the worse for it. The knowledge of this fact will not only  save them and the children much needless anguish and suffering, but  will make it much easier to deal with the latter, make it much easier  to get them divorced from the habit.    If we look at the matter in a sensible, common-sense way, and do not  tell the child caught in the practice that it has done something  disgracefully"]]]
