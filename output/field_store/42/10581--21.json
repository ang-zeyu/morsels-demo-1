How can I grind and polish quartz and agate rock,  and what kind of grinding and polishing material should I use? A.  Quartz and agate are slit with a thin iron disk supplied with  diamond dust moistened with brick oil. The rough grinding is done on  a lead wheel supplied with coarse emery and water. The smoothing is  done with a lead lap and fine emery, and the polishing may be  accomplished by means of a lead lap, whose surface is hacked and  supplied with rottenstone and water. 2. What is the best method of  polishing steel? A. The usual method is to grind first on a coarse  wet stone, then on a fine wet stone, then on a lead lap supplied  with fine emery and oil, and finally polish on a buff wheel supplied  with dry crocus and revolving rather slowly.    (2) R. L. J. asks how to make copying black and red inks. A. 1.  Bruised Aleppo nutgalls, 2 lb.; water, 1 gallon; boil in a copper  vessel for an hour, adding water to make up for that lost by  evaporation; strain and again boil the galls with a gallon of water  and strain; mix the liquors, and add immediately 10 oz. of copperas  in coarse powder and 8 oz. of gum arabic; agitate until solution of  these latter is effected, add a few drops of solution of potassium  permanganate, strain through a piece of hair cloth, and after  permitting to settle, bottle. The addition of a little extract of  logwood will render the ink blacker when first written with. Half an  ounce of sugar to the gallon will render it a good copying ink. 2.  Shellac, 4 oz.; borax, 2 oz.; water, 1 quart; boil till dissolved,  and add 2 oz. of gum arabic dissolved in a little hot water; boil  and add enough of a well triturated mixture of equal parts indigo  and lampblack to produce the proper color; after standing several  hours draw off and bottle. 3. Half a drachm of powdered drop lake  and 18 grains of powdered gum arabic dissolved in 3 oz. of ammonia  water constitute one of the finest red or carmine inks.    (3) X. inquires: What is the rule for making a counterbalanced face  wheel for engines? A. It is a common practice to place the counter  weight directly opposite the crank, with its center of gravity at  the same distance from the center of the shaft as the center of the  crank pin, making its weight equal to weight of piston, piston rod,  crosshead, and crank pin, plus half the weight of the connecting  rod.    (4) A. R. asks: What is the best way to remove cinders from the eye?  A. A small camel's hair brush dipped in water and passed over the  ball of the eye on raising the lid. The operation requires no skill,  takes but a moment, and instantly removes any cinder or particle of  dust or dirt without inflaming the eye.    (5) D. F. H. asks: Can I move a piston in a half inch glass tube by  the expansion of mercury? A. Yes, but you will require a long tube  to get any appreciable motion of the piston.    (6) J. W. asks: What size of a bore and what length of a stroke I  would want for a rocking valve engine of half a horse power? A.  About 2 inches cylinder and 3 inch stroke, depending upon pressure  and velocity.    (7) R. W. H. writes: In a recent discussion on hot air and steam  portable engines it was decided to ask your opinion, which should be  final. Water is scarce, though enough to use steam is easily procured.  The country is hilly, so that lightness is desirable. The power wanted  is 6 horse, and movable, that is, on wheels. Which will be best, hot air  engine or steam engine? Which consumes most coal for a given power?  Which will be cheapest in above case? A. For small powers the hot air  engine is most economical, but we do not think it adapted to your  purpose. We would recommend the steam engine for a portable power.    (8) J. C. T. writes: 1.

The end of it all is, as Aristotle said it should  be, not knowing but doing:--honourable desire of success, satisfaction  of the hopes of friends, a general literary appetite, conscious  preparation for private and public duty in the world, a steady  progression out of the shallows into the depths, a gaze beyond garden  and cloister, _in agmen, in pulverem, in clamorem_, to the dust and  burning sun and shouting of the days of conflict.                                         IV    In September 1829, as we have seen, Huskisson had disappeared. Thomas  Gladstone was in the train drawn by the _Dart_ that ran over the  statesman and killed him.         Poor Huskisson, he writes to William Gladstone, the great promoter       of the railroad, has fallen a victim to its opening!... As soon as       I heard that Huskisson had been run over, I ran and found him on       the ground close to the duke's [Wellington] car, his legs       apparently both broken (though only one was), the ground covered       with blood, his eyes open, but death written in his face. When they       raised him a little he said, 'Leave me, let me die.' 'God forgive       me, I am a dead man.' 'I can never stand this.'... On Tuesday he       made a speech in the Exchange reading room, when he said he hoped       long to represent them. He said, too, that day, that we were sure       of a fine day, for the duke would have his old luck. Talked       jokingly, too, of insuring his life for the ride.    And he notes, as others did, the extraordinary circumstance that of half  a million of people on the line of road the victim should be the duke's  great opponent, thus carried off suddenly before his eyes.    There was some question of Mr. John Gladstone taking Huskisson's place  as one of the members for Liverpool, but he did not covet it. He foresaw  too many local jealousies, his deafness would be sadly against him, he  was nearly sixty-five, and he felt himself too old to face the turmoil.  He looked upon the Wellington government as the only government  possible, though as a friend of Canning he freely recognised its  defects, the self-will of the duke, and the parcel of mediocrities and  drones with whom, excepting Peel, he had filled his cabinet. His view of  the state of parties in the autumn of 1830 is clear and succinct enough  to deserve reproduction. 'Huskisson's death,' he writes to his son at  Christ Church (October 29, 1830), 'was a great gain to the duke, for he  was the most formidable thorn to prick him in the parliament. Of those  who acted with Huskisson, none have knowledge or experience sufficient  to enable them to do so. As for the whigs, they can all talk and make  speeches, but they are not men of business. The ultra-tories are too  contemptible and wanting in talent to be thought of. The radicals cannot  be trusted, for they would soon pull down the venerable fabric of our  constitution. The liberals or independents must at least generally side  with the duke; they are likely to meet each other half way.'                               THE REFORM BILL    In less than a week after this acute survey the duke made his stalwart  declaration in the House of Lords against all parliamentary reform. 'I  have not said too much, have I?' he asked of Lord Aberdeen on sitting  down. 'You'll hear of it,' was Aberdeen's reply. 'You've announced the  fall of your government, that's all,' said another. In a fortnight  (November 18) the duke was out, Lord Grey was in, and the country was  gradually plunged into a determined struggle for the amendment of its  constitution.    Mr. Gladstone, as a resolute Canningite, was as fiercely hostile to the  second and mightier innovation as he had been eager for the relief of  the catholics, and it was in connection with the Reform bill that he  first made a public mark. The reader will recall the stages of that  event; how the bill was read a second time in the Commons by a majority  of one on March 22nd, 1831; how, after a defeat by a majority of eight  on a motion of going into committee, Lord Grey dissolved; how the  country, shaken to its depths, gave the reformers such undreamed of  strength, that on July 8th the second reading of the bill was carried by  a hundred and thirty-six; how on October 8th the Lords rejected it by  forty-one, and what violent commotions that deed provoked; how a third  bill was brought in (December 12th, 1831) and passed through the  Commons (March 23rd, 1832); how the Lords were still refractory; what a  lacerating ministerial crisis ensued; and how at last, in June, the  bill, which was to work the miracle of a millennium, actually became the  law of the land. Not even the pressure of preparation for the coming  ordeal of the examination schools could restrain the activity and zeal  of our Oxonian. Canning had denounced parliamentary reform at Liverpool  in 1820; and afterwards had declared in the House of Commons that if  anybody asked him what he meant to do on the subject, he would oppose  reform to the end of his life, under whatever shape it might appear.  Canning's disciple at Christ Church was as vehement as the master.[50]  To a friend he wrote in 1865:--         I think that Oxford teaching had in our day an anti-popular       tendency. I must add that it was not owing to the books, but rather       to the way in which they were handled: and further, that it tended       still more strongly in my opinion to make the love of truth       paramount over all other motives in the mind, and thus that it       supplied an antidote for whatever it had of bane. The Reform bill       frightened me in 1831, and drove me off my natural and previous       bias. Burke and Canning misled many on that subject, and they       misled me.    While staying at Leamington, whither his family constantly went in order  to be under the medical care of the famous Jephson, Mr. Gladstone went  to a reform meeting at Warwick, of which he wrote a contemptuous account  in a letter to the _Standard_ (April 7). The gentry present were few,  the nobility none, the clergy one only, while 'the mob beneath the grand  stand was Athenian in its levity, in its recklessness, in its gaping  expectancy, in its self-love and self-conceit--in everything but its  acuteness.' 'If, sir, the nobility, the gentry, the clergy are to be  alarmed, overawed, or smothered by the expression of popular opinion  such as this, and if no great statesman be raised up in our hour of  need to undeceive this unhappy multitude, now eagerly rushing or  heedlessly sauntering along the pathway of revolution, as an ox goeth to  the slaughter or a fool to the correction of the stocks, what is it but  a symptom as infallible as it is appalling, that the day of our  greatness and stability is no more, and that the chill and damp of death  are already creeping over England's glory.' These dolorous spectres  haunted him incessantly, as they haunted so many who had not the  sovereign excuse of youth, and his rhetoric was perfectly sincere. He  felt bound to say that, as far as he could form an opinion, the ministry  most richly deserved impeachment. Its great innovations and its small  alike moved his indignation. When Brougham committed the enormity of  hearing causes on Good Friday, Gladstone repeats with deep complacency a  saying of Wetherell, that Brougham was the first judge who had done such  a thing since Pontius Pilate.                             OXFORD ELECTIONEERING    The undergraduates took their part in the humours of the great election,  and Oxford turned out her chivalry gallantly to bring in the anti-reform  candidate for the county to the nomination. 'I mounted the mare to join  the anti-reform procession,' writes the impassioned student to his  father, 'and we looked as well as we could do, considering that we were  all covered with mud from head to foot. There was mob enough on both  sides, but I must do them justice to say they were for the most part  exceedingly good-humoured, and after we had dismounted, we went among  them and elbowed one another and bawled and bellowed with the most  perfect good temper. At the nomination in the town hall there was so  much row raised that not one of the candidates could be heard.' The  effect of these exercitations was a hoarseness and cold, which did not,  however, prevent the sufferer from taking his part in a mighty bonfire  in Peckwater. On another day:--         I went with Denison and another man named Jeffreys between eleven       and twelve. We began to talk to some men among Weyland's friends;       they crowded round, and began to holloa at us, and were making a       sort of ring round us preparatory to a desperate hustle, when lo!       up rushed a body of Norreys' men from St. Thomas's, broke their       ranks, raised a shout, and rescued us in great style. I shall ever       be grateful to the men of St. Thomas's. When we were talking,       Jeffreys said something which made one man holloa, 'Oh, his       father's a parson.' This happened to be true, and flabbergasted me,       but he happily turned it by reminding them, that they were going to       vote for Mr. Harcourt, son of the greatest parson in England but       one (Archbishop of York). Afterwards they left me, and I pursued my       work alone, conversed with a great number, shook hands with a fair       proportion, made some laugh, and once very nearly got hustled when       alone, but happily escaped. You would be beyond measure astonished       how unanimous and how _strong_ is the feeling among the freeholders       (who may be taken as a fair specimen of the generality of all       counties) _against_ the catholic question. Reformers and       anti-reformers were alike sensitive on that point and"]]]
