Don't look below, but just keep your  eyes in front of you, and never leave go of one grip till you make  sure of the next.\"    Five minutes later he stood on the deck.    \"Well done, my lad, for the first time,\" the first mate said, as  Reuben put his foot on the deck \"I have had my eye on you. I  shouldn't have let you go beyond the top, at the first trial; but I  didn't think you would go higher, till you were fairly up,  otherwise I should have hailed you from the deck.    \"You ought not to have taken him up above the top, Bill. If he had  lost his head, it would have been all up with him.\"    \"I could see he wasn't going to lose his head. Trust me for not  leading a young hand into danger. He was a little flustrated, when  he got into the top; but after he had sat down a bit, his breath  come quiet and regular again, and I could see there was no chance  of his nerve going.\"    The next morning, soon after daybreak, the dockyard boats began to  row alongside, with grey-coated convicts. Reuben watched them as  they came on board, with a sort of fascination with their closely  cut hair, bullet heads, and evil faces. Although he had no doubt  that the repulsive expression was due partly to the close-cut hair  and shaved faces, and their hideous garb, he could scarcely repress  a shudder as he looked at them. In some faces an expression of  brutal ferocity was dominant. Others had a shifty, cunning look, no  less repulsive.    There were a few good-humoured faces, one or two so different from  the others, that Reuben wondered whether they were innocent victims  of circumstances, as he had so nearly been. Not till now did he  quite realize how great his escape had been. The thought that he  might have had to spend the rest of his life herding with such men  as these, made him feel almost sick; and he thanked God more  fervently, even, than he had done when the verdict was returned  which restored him to his liberty, that he had been saved from such  a fate.    A hundred and eighty convicts came on board. They were in charge of  ten warders, with loaded muskets, and an hour later a party of  twenty marines, under the charge of an officer, also embarked. They  were on their way out to join a ship in Australian waters, and were  to aid the warders in keeping the convicts in good order.    The wind being favourable, no time was lost after the marines had  come on board. The moorings were cast off and sails hoisted, and  the Paramatta made her way against the tide to the mouth of the  Medway; and there dropped her anchor to wait until the tide began  to ebb, for the wind was so light that little would have been  gained by an attempt to proceed at once. Sail was made again as  soon as tide turned and, on turning out next morning at daylight,  for he had not yet been assigned to a watch, Reuben found that the  ship was lying at anchor in the Downs.    Two or three hours passed.    \"What are we doing here, Bill?\"    \"We are waiting for the passengers. They are all coming on board  here. I expect that big lugger you see, running out direct for us,  'as got them on board.\"    \"I wonder they didn't come on board when we started,\" Reuben said.  \"I should think it would have been pleasanter than coming all the  way down to Dover by coach.\"    \"So I should think, my lad; but you see, it ain't every time as a  ship has the luck we've had. It's a long job coming down to the  Downs, if the wind don't serve. We might have been beating about  there, at the mouth of the Thames, for a week. So you see, most of  these 'longshore chaps like to send their traps on board while the  vessel's in the docks, and then to come down here and stop till she  comes round.\"    In a few minutes the lugger was alongside, the gangway was lowered,  and the passengers began to come on board. They were, as the sailor  had said they would be, some ten in number. There were six men,  four ladies, and three children, the latter not counting as regular  passengers, as they were stowed away in their parents' cabins.    The convicts who were on deck looked over the bulwarks, and cracked  coarse jokes among themselves, as the passengers ascended the  gangway. Reuben found that only one-third of the number were  allowed on deck at once. Two soldiers paced up and down the deck,  on guard of the hatchway leading below, and two sentries were  posted at other points.    A number of small boxes, bags, coats and cloaks were handed up, and  then the rope was cast off, and the lugger made her way back to  Dover, and the Paramatta again got under sail. While they had been  waiting, the chief mate had told Reuben that, according to the  captain's orders, he would henceforth be in his watch.    \"As you are not regularly shipped as a sailor,\" the mate said, \"the  captain does not wish you to go aloft, unless by your own desire;  but there will be plenty of work for you to do on deck, hauling at  the braces, scrubbing, and so on.\"    \"I should be glad to do my work with the rest,\" Reuben said, \"as  soon as I feel I can be useful aloft. I was up two or three times  yesterday, and hope in a few days to be quite accustomed to it.\"    \"I have noticed you, my lad, and you could not be in better hands  than Bill's. He is a capital sailor, and as he has taken to you,  and you are willing to learn, you will be a useful hand before we  get to Sydney; and even if you never go to sea again, all your  life, you will find that you have learned a great deal that is  useful on board the Paramatta.\"    The fine weather, which the Paramatta had experienced so far,  speedily left her. The sky grew overcast, and the wind freshened  fast, and the next morning the ship was staggering, under  close-reefed canvas, in the teeth of the southwesterly gale.    For the next three days Reuben made no advance in seamanship, being  prostrated with seasickness. At times he crept out from the  forecastle, and tried to lend a hand whenever he saw a party of men  hauling at a rope; but the motion of the ship was so great that he  could scarce keep his feet on the slippery decks, and at last the  mate ordered him to go back to the forecastle, and remain there  until he recovered somewhat from his sickness.    \"I see you are no skulker, my lad; but you will do no good on deck  here, and are not unlikely to get a heavy fall, and perhaps a nasty  hurt, so you had best lie off till you get over your sickness.\"    Reuben was already drenched to the skin by the spray, and felt so  weak that he was not sorry to avail himself of the mate's orders,  and to turn in again to his bunk in the forecastle.    On the morning of the fourth day he felt himself again, and turned  out. The gale had almost blown itself out, but the sea was very  heavy. The fresh air was delightful to Reuben, after the  confinement in the forecastle; and as his watch was on deck, he at  once went up to Bill and asked him what he could do.    \"Glad to see you about agin, Reuben,\" the sailor said. \"You have  had a worse time of it than most. There is a lot of difference  atween chaps. Some takes it bad, and some is never ill from the  first. Well, there ain't nothing to do at present, but just hold on  and get to feel your legs. Don't you try to go across the deck, if  the hands are called, until you are accustomed to it; else you will  get a fall, to a certainty.\"    \"Is the gale nearly over, Bill?\"    \"Why, it's quite over. Don't you see that for yourself?\"    \"It seems to me to blow hard now.\"    \"Blow hard! Why, there ain't a capful of wind. It was blowing  pretty hard yesterday, if you like, but not worth calling a gale.  If you are lucky, you are like to know what a gale is, when we get  south of the Cape. The wind does blow there, when it has made up  its mind. That's the place where they say as the helmsman has to  have two men, regular, to hold on his hair.\"    Reuben laughed.    \"I think on the whole, Bill, I would rather get to Sydney without  meeting a storm like that. This has been quite enough for me. Why,  some of the waves hit the vessel's bow as if they would have  knocked it in.\"    \"Wait till you have a gale in earnest, Master Reuben, and you will  know about it then. Of course it seemed worse to you, because you  were lying there a-doing nothing, and was weak-like with heaving  yourself up. If you had been on deck, you would have seen as it was  nothing worth talking about.    \"Look at the ship. Everything's in its place, and ship-shape.\"    \"Why, what has become of the tall spars aloft,\" Reuben said,  looking up.    \"Oh, they were sent down when the wind freshened,\" Bill said.  \"There ain't nothing in that.\"    \"Where are the convicts, Bill?\"    \"Oh, they are all battened down below,\" the sailor said carelessly.  \"They only come up for an airing when the weather is fine. They are  like the passengers only, instead of pleasing themselves, their  ways are marked out for them.\"    \"Have any of the passengers been up?\"    \"Two or three of the men have shown, and a gal. It ain't her first  voyage, I'll bet. A pretty thing she is, and as straight as a mast.  She's been on deck, off and on, ever since we started.\"    The next morning the sea moderated greatly and, the wind having  gone round to the southeast, the Paramatta made the most of it, to  get west as far as possible before turning her head to the south.    \"That's a slice of luck,\" Bill Hardy said to Reuben; \"there's  nothing like getting well off, at the start. With luck, now, we  oughtn't to see the land till we make the Cape.\"    \"But I would rather see the land, Bill. When one is going half  round the globe, it is pleasant to touch at ports on the way, and  to get a glimpse at foreign peoples and ways.\"    \"Ay, I like a spree on shore,\" Bill agreed; \"but after all, it  don't last long;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#17)"],[1,"latter, that I am indirectly indebted for this  story. Miss North has typically psychic hands--exquisitely white and  narrow, and her long, tapering fingers and filbert nails (which, by  the way, are always trimly manicured) are the most perfect I have ever  seen. I was alluding to them, on our way back to the hotel after her  performance, when Hely Browne interrupted me.    \"Talking about psychic things, O'Donnell,\" he said, \"do you know there  is a haunted house near where we are staying? You don't? Very well,  then, if I tell you what I know and you write about it, will you  promise not to allude to the house by its right number? If you do,  there will be the dickens to pay--simply call it '---- House,' near  Sandyford Place. You promise? Good! Let us take a little stroll before  we turn in--I feel I want a breath of fresh air--and I will tell you  the experience I once had there. It is exactly two years ago, and I  was on tour here in _The Green Bushes_. All the usual theatrical  'diggings' had been snapped up long before I arrived, and, not  knowing where else to go, I went to No.--Sandyford Place, which I saw  advertised in one of the local papers as a first-class private hotel  with very moderate charges. A wild bit of extravagance, eh? But then  one does do foolish things sometimes, and, to tell the truth, I wanted  a change badly. I had 'digged' for a long time with a fellow called  Charlie Grosvenor. Not at all a bad chap, but rather apt to get on  one's nerves after a while--and he had got on mine--horribly.  Consequently, I was not at all sorry for an excuse to get away from  him for a bit, even though I had to pay dearly for it. A private hotel  in a neighbourhood like that of Sandyford Place is a big order for an  ordinary comedian. I forget exactly what the terms were, but I know I  pulled rather a long face when I was told. Still, being, as I say,  tired of the usual 'digs,' I determined to try it, and accordingly  found myself landed in a nice-sized bedroom on the second floor. The  first three nights passed, and nothing happened, saving that I had the  most diabolical nightmares--a very unusual thing for me. 'It was the  cheese,' I said to myself, when I got out of bed the first morning; 'I  will take very good care I don't touch cheese to-night.' I kept this  resolution, but I had the nightmare again, and even, if anything,  worse than before. Then I fancied it must be cocoa--I was at that time  a teetotaller--so I took hot milk instead; but I had nightmare all the  same, and my dreams terrified me to such an extent that I did not dare  get out of bed in the morning (it was then winter) till it was broad  daylight. It was now becoming a serious matter with me. As you know,  an actor more than most people needs sleep, and it soon became as much  as I could do to maintain my usual standard of acting. On the fourth  night, determining to get rest at all costs, I took a stiff glass of  hot brandy just before getting into bed. I slept,--I could scarcely  help sleeping,--but not for long, for I was rudely awakened from my  slumbers by a loud crash. I sat up in bed, thinking the whole house  was falling about my ears. The sound was not repeated, and all was  profoundly silent. Wondering what on earth the noise could have been,  and feeling very thirsty, I got out of bed to get a drink of  lime-juice. To my annoyance, however, though I groped about  everywhere, knocking an ash tray off the mantelpiece and smashing the  lid of the soap-dish, I could find neither the lime-juice nor matches.  At length, giving it up as a bad job, I decided to get into bed again.  With that end in view, I groped my way through the darkness, steering  myself by the furniture, the position of which was, of course, quite  familiar to me--at least I imagined it was. Judge, then, of my  astonishment when I could not find the bed! At first I regarded it as  a huge joke, and laughed--how rich! Ha! ha! ha! Fancy not being able  to find one's way back to bed in a room of this dimension! Good enough  for _Punch_! Too good, perhaps, now. Ha! ha! ha! But it soon grew past  a joke. I had been round the room, completely round the room, twice,  and still no bed! I became seriously alarmed! Could I be ill? Was I  going mad? But no, my forehead was cool, my pulse normal. For some  seconds I stood still, not knowing what else to do; then, to make one  more desperate attempt, I stuck straight in front of me--and--ran  into something--something that recoiled and hit me. Thrilled with  amazement, I put up my hand to feel what it was, and touched a noose.\"    \"A noose!\" I ejaculated, interrupting Hely Browne for the first time  since he began.    \"Yes, a noose!\" he repeated, \"suspended in mid-air. As you can  imagine, I was greatly astonished, for I knew there had been nothing  that I could be now mistaking for a noose in the room overnight. I  stretched out my arms to feel to what it was fastened, but, to add to  my surprise, the cord terminated in thin air. Then I grew frightened,  and, dropping my arms, tried to move away from the spot; I could  not--my feet were glued to the floor. With a gentle, purring sound  the noose commenced fawning--I use that word because the action was  so intensely bestial, so like that of a cat or snake--round my neck  and face. It then rose above me, and, after circling furiously round  and round and creating a miniature maelstrom in the air, descended  gradually over my head. Lower and lower it stole, like some sleek,  caressing slug. Now past the tips of my ears, now my nose, now my  chin, until with a tiny thud it landed on my shoulders, when, with a  fierce snap, it suddenly tightened. I endeavoured to tear it off, but  every time I raised my hands, a strong, magnetic force drew them to  my side again; I opened my mouth to shriek for help, and an icy  current of air froze the breath in my lungs. I was helpless,  O'Donnell, utterly, wholly helpless. Cold, clammy hands tore my feet  from the floor; I was hoisted bodily up, and then let drop. A  frightful pain shot through me. A hundred wires cut into my throat at  once. I gasped, choked, suffocated, and in my mad efforts to find a  foothold kicked out frantically in all directions. But this only  resulted in an increase of my torments, since with every plunge the  noose grew tauter. My agony at last grew unbearable; I could feel the  sides of my raw and palpitating thorax driven into one another, while  every attempt to heave up breath from my bursting lungs was rewarded  with the most excruciating paroxysms of pain--pain more acute than I  thought it possible for any human being to endure. My head became  ten times its natural size; blood--foaming, boiling blood--poured  into it from God knows where, and under its pressure my eyes bulged  in their sockets, and the veins in my nose cracked. Terrific  thunderings echoed and re-echoed in my ears; my tongue, huge as a  mountain, shot against my teeth; a sea of fire raged through my  brain, and then--blackness--blackness inconceivable. When I recovered  consciousness, O'Donnell, I found myself standing, cold and  shivering, but otherwise sound and whole, on the chilly oilcloth. I  had, now, no difficulty in finding my way back to bed, and in about  an hour's time succeeded in falling asleep. I slept till late, and,  on getting up, tried to persuade myself that my horrible experience  was but the result of another nightmare.    \"As you may guess, after all this, I did not look forward to bedtime,  and counted the minutes as they flew by with the utmost regret. Never  had I been so sorry when my performance at the theatre was over, and  the lights of my hotel once again hove in sight. I entered my bedroom  in fear and trembling, and was so apprehensive lest I should be again  compelled to undergo the sensations of hanging, that I decided to keep  a light burning all night, and, for that reason, had bought half a  pound of wax candles. At last I grew so sleepy that I could keep awake  no longer, and, placing the candlestick on a chair by the bed, I  scrambled in between the sheets. Without as much as a sip of spirits,  I slept like a top. When I awoke the room was in pitch darkness. A  curious smell at once attracted my notice. I thought, at first, it  might be but the passing illusion of a dream. But no--I sniffed  again--it was there--there, close to me--under my very nose--the  strong, pungent odour of drugs; but not being a professor of smells,  nor even a humble student of physics, I was consequently unable to  diagnose it, and could only arrive at the general conclusion that it  was a smell that brought with it very vivid recollections of a  chemist's shop and of my old school laboratory. Wondering whence it  originated, I thrust my face forward with the intention of trying to  locate it, when, to my horror, my lips touched against something cold  and flabby. In an agony of fear I reeled away from it, and, the bed  being narrow, I slipped over the edge and bumped on to the floor.    \"Now I think it is quite possible that up to this point you may have  attributed my unhappy experience to nothing more nor less than a bad  dream, but your dream theory can no longer hold good, for, on coming  in such sudden contact with the floor, I gave my funny-bone a knock,  which, I can assure you, made me thoroughly awake, and the first thing  I noticed on recovering my scattered senses--was the smell. I sat up,  and saw to my terror my bed was occupied, but occupied in the most  alarming manner. On the middle of the pillow was a face, the face  of--I looked closer; I would have given every penny I possessed not to  have done so, but I could not help myself--I looked closer, and it  was--the face of my brother; my brother Ralph--you may recollect my  mentioning him to you, for he was the only one of us who was at that  time making money--whom I believed to be in New York. He had always  been rather sallow, but apart"]]]
