Deer said, \"Well, I can do it if you can.\"    So Rabbit stretched a larger grapevine across the trail but without  gnawing it in the center. Deer ran back as he had seen Rabbit do, made  a spring, and struck the grapevine right in the center. It only flew  back and threw him over.    Deer tried again and again, but he was only bruised and hurt.    \"Let me see your teeth,\" said Rabbit. They were long like a wolf's  teeth but not very sharp.    \"No wonder you cannot do it,\" said Rabbit. \"Your teeth are too blunt  to bite anything. Let me sharpen them for you so they are like mine.  My teeth are so sharp I can cut through a stick just like a knife.\"    And Rabbit showed Deer a black locust twig, of which rabbits gnaw the  young shoots, which he had shaved off as well as a knife could do it.    So Deer let Rabbit sharpen his teeth. But Rabbit got a hard stone with  rough edges and ground down the Deer's teeth until they were blunt.    \"Now try it,\" said Rabbit to Deer. So Deer tried it again, but he  could not bite at all.    \"Now you've paid for your horns,\" said Rabbit as he sprang through the  underbrush. That is why the Deer's teeth are blunt.          LEGEND OF THE HEAD OF GOLD    _Dakota_      A man had four children. And they were all young men, but they were  poor and it seemed as if they would die of laziness. The old man said,  \"Behold! old woman. I have the greatest pity for my youngest child,  and I do not wish him to die of poverty. See here; let us seek the  Great Mystery, Wakantanka. If we find him, behold! I will give the boy  to him to train up well for me.\"    \"Yes, old man; you say well. We will do so,\" said the old woman. So at  once they went toward the Darkening Land, seeking Wakantanka. They  came to a very high hill; and as they came to it, behold! another man  came there also.    The stranger said, \"For what are you seeking?\"    \"Alas, my friend,\" the old man said, \"my child, whom I pity, I wish to  give to Wakantanka, the Great Mystery, and so I am seeking him.\"    \"Yes, friend. I am Wakantanka,\" said the man. \"My friend, give him to  me. I will take him to my home.\"    So when the father gave up the boy, the Great Mystery took him to a  house that stood up like the clouds. He said, \"Look at this house as  much as you like. Take good care of these horses. But do not look into  the little house that stands here.\"    Having said this, he gave him all the keys. He added, \"Yes, have a  watch of this. Lo, I am going on a journey.\" He said this and went  away.    It was evening; he came home with a great many men, who sat down,  filling the house. When they had been there a good while one of them  said, \"The boy is good; that is enough.\" Saying this, he went out. In  like manner, all the men went home.    Then again Wakantanka said, \"Behold, I go on a journey. Stay here and  keep watch.\" So again he went away.    While the boy was watching, one of the horses said, \"Friend, go into  the little house where you are commanded not to look, and inside in  the middle of the floor stands something yellow. Dip your head in that  and make haste--we two are together. When he brings home a great many  men, they will eat you, as they will eat me, but I am unwilling--we  two shall share the same,\" he said.    So the boy went into the little house. In the middle of the floor  stood a round yellow thing into which he dipped his head. Immediately  his head became golden and the house was shining and full of light.    Then he came out and jumped on the horse that had talked to him and  they fled.    They went very fast. Now when they had gone a long way, behold! there  came after them the one who called himself Wakantanka. He shouted,  \"You bad rascals, stop! You shall not live! Where will you go in such  a small country as this?\"    Saying this he came toward them and they were much frightened. Again  he shouted, \"You bad rascals, stop! You shall not live.\" And indeed it  seemed as if they could not live.    Then the horse said, \"Take the egg you have and throw it behind us.\"  The boy did so. At once the whole country became a sea. He who  followed was obliged to stop. He said, \"Alas, my horse, have mercy on  me and take me to the other side. If you do, I will value you very  highly.\"    \"Oh, I am not willing to do that,\" the horse replied. But he continued  to urge. Then he threw himself down from above the water, so that when  he came to the middle of it, he went down and both he and the horse  were drowned. But the boy passed safely on.    So he came to the dwellings of people and remained there. But from  behind they came to attack and fought with them. But the boy turned  his head around, and his head was covered with gold; also the horse he  sat upon was golden, and those who came against him were thrown off  their horses and only a few remained when the battle was over. Again,  when they returned to the attack, he destroyed them all. So the boy  was much thought of by the people.          THE MILKY WAY    _Cherokee_      Now the Indians had a corn mill, in which they pounded the corn into  meal. Several mornings when they came to the stone in which the corn  was pounded, they saw that some of the meal had been stolen. Therefore  they looked at the ground. They found the tracks of a dog.    The next night, the people watched, and when the dog came from the  north, they saw him begin to eat meal out of the stone bowl. Then they  sprang out and whipped him.    The dog ran howling back to the north, dropping the meal from his  mouth as he ran. Therefore he left behind a white trail where we now  see the Milky Way. But the Cherokees called it \"Where-the-dog-ran.\"          COYOTE AND GRAY FOX    _Ponca_      Gray fox was very fat. Coyote said, \"Younger brother, what has made  you fat?\" \"Elder brother,\" said the Gray Fox, \"I lie down on the trail  in the way of those who carry crackers, and I pretend to be dead. When  they throw me in the wagon, I lie there, kicking the crackers out.  Then I leap out and start home eating. It is the crackers which make  me fat. Elder brother, I wish you would do likewise. Elder brother,  you have large feet, so I think will knock out a great many crackers.\"    Coyote went to the place and lay down in the trail. When the white man  came along, he threw Coyote into the wagon. The white man thought, \"It  is not the first time he has acted in this way,\" so he tied the feet  of Coyote. Having put the Coyote in the wagon, the white man went to  his house. He threw Coyote out near an old outhouse. Then the white  man brought a knife, and cut the cords which bound Coyote's feet. He  acted as if Coyote was dead, so he threw him over his back and started  off for the house.    But Coyote managed to get loose and ran homeward. He went back to get  even with Gray Fox.    \"Oh, younger brother,\" said Coyote, \"you have made me suffer.\"    \"You yourself are to blame,\" said Gray Fox. \"Be silent and listen to  me. You brought the trouble on yourself as you lay down in the place  where the white man came with his load of goods.\"    \"Oh, younger brother, you tell the truth,\" said Coyote. But Gray Fox  had tempted him.          ICTINIKE AND THE TURTLE    _Omaha_      Ictinike was journeying. When he came in sight at a bend of a stream,  Big Turtle was sitting there in a sheltered place warmed by the sun.  Ictinike drew himself back out of sight, crouching at intervals as he  retraced his steps, and ran down the hill to where Big Turtle was.    \"Why! How is it that you continue to pay no attention to what is going  on? It has been said that yonder stream is to dry up so that all the  four-footed animals that frequent the water have kept close to the  deep water,\" said Ictinike.    Big Turtle said, \"Why! I have been coming here regularly, but I have  not heard anything at all. I usually come and sit in this place when  the sun gets as high as it is at present.\"    \"Hurry!\" said Ictinike, \"for some of the young men died very soon for  want of water. The young otters died, so did the young muskrats, the  young beavers, and the young raccoons.\"    \"Come, let us go,\" said Big Turtle. So Ictinike departed with him. As  he accompanied him, Ictinike sought for a dry bone. Having found one  that would be good as a club, Ictinike said, \"Friend, go on.  _Mingam._\"    When he was alone, Ictinike seized the bone, and before long overtook  Big Turtle, walking along beside him.    \"Friend,\" said he, \"when a person walks, he stretches his neck often.\"    So Big Turtle began to stretch his neck very far, and he was walking  with his legs bent very much. As he was going thus, Ictinike gave him  a hard blow on the neck, knocking him senseless, and he did not stop  beating him until he had killed him.    \"Ha, ha!\" said Ictinike, as he carried Big Turtle away. \"There are  some days when I act thus for myself.\"    He kindled a fire and began to roast Big Turtle. Then he became very  sleepy, and said, \"Ho! I will sleep, but you, O, Ijaxe, must keep  awake. Big Turtle, when you are cooked, you must say, '_Puff!_'\"    So he went to sleep. Now Coyote came along, very cautiously. He seized  Big Turtle, pulled one of the legs out of the fire, and sat there,  biting off the meat. When he had eaten all the meat on all the legs,  he pushed the bones back just as they had been before, arranged the  fire over them, and left after putting everything just as he had found  it.    At length Ictinike awoke. He pushed into the ashes to find Big Turtle,  took hold of a leg, and pulled it out. Only that leg came out.  \"Pshaw!\" said he. Then he tried another leg, with a like result, and  still another, but only the bones appeared.
