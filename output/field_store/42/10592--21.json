He perceived and determined and responded in the same instant.  In point of fact the three actions of perceiving, determining, and  responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were the intervals  of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His muscles were  surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply, like steel  springs. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad and rampant,  until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and  pour forth generously over the world.    \"Never was there such a dog,\" said John Thornton one day, as the  partners watched Buck marching out of camp.    \"When he was made, the mould was broke,\" said Pete.    \"Py jingo! I t'ink so mineself,\" Hans affirmed.    They saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and  terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the  secrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing  of the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow  that appeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take  advantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like a  snake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest, kill  a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks fleeing  a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not too quick  for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He killed  to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he killed  himself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was his  delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them, to  let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.    As the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater  abundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less  rigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown calf;  but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and he  came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band of  twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,  and chief among them was a great bull. He was in a savage temper, and,  standing over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist  as even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great  palmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet  within the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,  while he roared with fury at sight of Buck.    From the bull's side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered  arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct  which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck  proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He  would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach  of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have  stamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on  the fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of  rage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring  him on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus  separated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would  charge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.    There is a patience of the wild--dogged, tireless, persistent as life  itself--that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,  the snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience  belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it  belonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding  its march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their  half-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.  For half a day this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from  all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his  victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the patience of  creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that of creatures  preying.    As the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest  (the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long),  the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the  aid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was harrying them  on to the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this  tireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not the life of  the herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only  one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,  and in the end they were content to pay the toll.    As twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his  mates--the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he  had mastered--as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading  light. He could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless  fanged terror that would not let him go. Three hundredweight more than  half a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight  and struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature  whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.    From then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it a  moment's rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or  the shoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull  opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams  they crossed. Often, in desperation, he burst into long stretches of  flight. At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him, but loped easily  at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was played, lying down  when the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat  or drink.    The great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and  the shambling trot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long  periods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and  Buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to  rest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes  fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming  over the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land. As the  moose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.  Forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The news  of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but by  some other and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet knew  that the land was somehow different; that through it strange things were  afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he had finished  the business in hand.    At last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.  For a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping, turn  and turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his face  toward camp and John Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope, and  went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way, heading  straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that  put man and his magnetic needle to shame.    As he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the  land. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had been  there throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon him  in some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the squirrels  chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several times he  stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs, reading a  message which made him leap on with greater speed. He was oppressed with  a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity already happened;  and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley  toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.    Three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair  rippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.  Buck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and  tense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story--all but  the end. His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the  life on the heels of which he was travelling. He remarked the pregnant  silence of the forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in  hiding. One only he saw,--a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray  dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the  wood itself.    As Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose  was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped  and pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.  He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow  protruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.    A hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs Thornton  had bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a death-struggle,  directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him without stopping. From  the camp came the faint sound of many voices, rising and falling in a  sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge of the clearing, he found  Hans, lying on his face, feathered with arrows like a porcupine. At the  same instant Buck peered out where the spruce-bough lodge had been and  saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders.  A gust of overpowering rage swept over him. He did not know that he  growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity. For the last  time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason, and it  was because of his great love for John Thornton"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21528"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine, Volume 1,  No. 1, August 1850 (#17)"],[1,"se-hauled against the  match, notwithstanding of the young folks makin' it all up; so he'd  taken out berths aboard of a large Company's ship, and bought over the  captain on no account to let any king's navy man within the gangways,  nor not a shoulder with a swab upon it, red or blue, beyond the ship's  company. But, above all, the old tyrant wouldn't have a blue-jacket,  from stem to starn, if so be he'd got nothing ado but talk sweet; I  s'pose he fancied his girl was mad after the whole blessed cloth. The  leftenant turns over this here log to me, and, says he, \"I'll follow  her to the world's end, if need be, Bob, and cheat the old villain?\"  \"Quite right too, sir,\" says I. \"Bob,\" says he, \"I'll tell ye what I  wants you to do. Go you and enter for the Seringpatam at Blackwall, if  you're for sea just now; I'm goin' for to s'cure my passage myself, an'  no doubt doorin' the voy'ge something'll turn up to set all square; at  any rate, I'll stand by for a rope to pull!\" \"Why here's a go!\" thinks I  to myself: \"is Ned Collins got so green again, spite of all that's come  an' gone, for to think the waves is agoin' to work wonders, or ould  Neptune under the line's to play the parson and splice all!\" \"Well,  sir,\" I says, \"but don't you think the skipper will smoke your  weather-roll, sir, at sea, as you did Bill Pikes an' me, you know, sir?\"  says I. \"Oh, Bob, my lad,\" says the leftenant, \"leave you that to me.  The fellow most onlikest to a sailor on the Indyman's poop will be me,  and that's the way you'll know me!\"    Well, I did ship with the Seringpatam for Bombay. Plenty of passengers  she had, but only clerks, naboobs, old half-pay fellows, and ladies, not  to speak o' children and nurses, black and white. She sailed without my  seein' Leftenant Collins, so I thought I was to hear no more on it. When  the passengers began to muster on the poop, by the time we got out o'  Channel, I takes a look over the ladies, in coilin' up the ropes aft, or  at the wheel. I knowed the said girl at once by her good looks, and the  old fellow by his grumpy-yallow frontispiece. All on a sudden I takes  note of a figger coming up from the cuddy, which I made out at once for  my Master Ned, spite of his wig and a pair o' high-heeled boots, as gave  him the walk of a chap treading amongst eggs. When I hears him lisp out  to the skipper at the round-house if there was any fear of wind, 'twas  all I could do to keep the juice in my cheek. Away he goes up to  windward, holding on by everything, to look over the bulwarks behind his  sweetheart, givin' me a glance over his shoulder. At night I see the two  hold a sort of a collogue abaft the wheel, when I was on my trick at the  helm. After a while there was a row got up amongst the passengers, with  the old naboob and the skipper, to find out who it was that kept a  singing every still night in the first watch, alongside of the ladies'  cabin, under the poop. It couldn't be cleared up, hows'ever, who it was.  All sorts o' places they said it comed from--mizen-chains,  quarter-galleries, lower-deck ports, and davit-boats. But what put the  old hunks most in a rage was, the songs was every one on 'em such as  \"Rule Britannia,\" \"Bay of Biscay,\" \"Britannia's Bulwarks,\" and \"All in  the Downs.\" The captain was all at sea about it, and none of the men  would say anything, for by all accounts 'twas the best pipe at a  sea-song as was to be heard. For my part, I knowed pretty well what was  afloat. One night a man comed for'ard from the wheel, after steering his  dog-watch out, and \"Well I'm blessed, mates,\" says he on the fok'sle,  \"but that chap aft yonder with the lady--he's about the greenest hand  I've chanced to come across! What d'ye think I hears him say to old  Yallowchops an hour agone?\" \"What was it, mate?\" I says. Says he, \"'Do  ye know, Sar Chawls, is the hoshun reely green at the line--_green_ ye  know, Sar Chawls, _reely_ green?' 'No, sir,' says the old naboob, ''tis  blue.' 'Whoy, ye don't sa--ay so!' says the young chap, pullin' a long  face.\" \"Why, Jim,\" another hand drops in, \"that's the very chap as sings  them first-rate sea-songs of a night! I seed him myself come out o' the  mizen-chains!\" \"Hallo!\" says another at this, \"then there's some'at  queer i' the wind!\" I _thought_ he gave rather a weather-look aloft,  comin' on deck i' the morning! I'll bet a week's grog the chap's  desarted from the king's flag, mates! Well, ye know, hereupon I  couldn't do no less nor shove in my oar, so I takes word from all hands  not to blow the gaff,[A] an' then gives 'em the whole yarn to the very  day, about the Green Hand--for somehow or another, I was always a  yarning sort of a customer. As soon as they heard it was a love consarn,  not a man but swore to keep a stopper on his jaw; only, at findin' out  he was a leftenant in the Royal Navy, all hands was for touching hats  when they went past.    [Footnote A: Let out the secret.]    Hows'ever, things went on till we'd crossed the line a good while; the  leftenant was making his way with the girl at every chance. But as for  the old fellow, I didn't see he was a fathom the nearer with _him_;  though, as the naboob had never clapt eyes on him to know him like,  'twain't much matter before heaving in sight o' port. The captain of the  Indyman was a rum old-fashioned codger, all for plain sailing and old  ways--I shouldn't say overmuch of a smart seaman. He read the sarvice  every Sunday, rigged the church an' all that, if it was anything short  of a reef-taups'l breeze. 'Twas queer enough, ye may think, to hear the  old boy drawling out, \"As 'twas in the beginning,\"--then, in the one  key, \"Haul aft the mainsheet,\"--\"is now and ever shall be,\"--\"Small pull  with the weather-brace,\"--\"Amen,\"--\"Well the mainyard,\"--\"The Lord be  with you,--Taups'l yard well!\" As for the first orficer, he was a  dandy, know-nothing young blade, as wanted to show off before the  ladies; and the second was afraid to call the nose on his face his own,  except in his watch; the third was a good seaman, but ye may fancy the  craft stood often a poor chance of being well handled.    'Twas one arternoon watch, off the west coast of Africay, as hot a day  as I mind on, we lost the breeze with a swell, and just as it got down  smooth, land was made out, low upon the starboard bow, to the  south-east. The captain was turned in sick below, and the first orficer  on deck. I was at the wheel, and I hears him say to the second how the  land-breeze would come off at night. A little after, up comes Leftenant  Collins, in his black wig and his 'long-shore hat, an' begins to squint  over the starn to nor'west'ard, \"Jacobs, my lad,\" whispers he to me,  \"how d'ye like the looks o' things?\" \"Not overmuch, sir,\" says I; \"small  enough sea-room for the sky there!\" Up goes he to the first officer,  after a bit. \"Sir,\" says he, \"do ye notice how we've risen the land  within the last hour and a half?\" \"No, sir,\" says the first mate; \"what  d'ye mean?\" \"Why, there's a current here, takin' us inside the point,\"  says he. \"Sir,\" says the Company's man, \"if I didn't know what's what,  d'ye think I'd larn it off a gentleman as is so confounded green?  There's nothing of the sort,\" he says. \"Look on the starboard quarter  then,\" says the leftenant, \"at the man-o'-war bird afloat yonder with  its wings spread. Take three minutes' look,\" says he. Well, the mate did  take a minute or two's look through the mizen-shroud, and pretty blue he  got, for the bird came abreast of the ship by that time. \"Now,\" says the  leftenant, \"d'ye think ye'd weather that there point two hours after  this, if a gale come on from the nor'west, sir?\" \"Well,\" says the first  mate, \"I daresay we shouldn't--but what o' that?\" \"Why, if you'd cruised  for six months off the coast of Africa, as I've done,\" says the  leftenant, \"you'd think there was something ticklish about that white  spot in the sky to nor'west! But on top o' that, the weather-glass is  fell a good bit since four bells.\" \"Weather-glass!\" the mate says, \"why,  that don't matter much in respect of a gale, I fancy.\" Ye must  understand, weather-glasses wan't come so much in fashion at that time,  except in the royal navy. \"Sir,\" says the mate again, \"mind _your_  business, if you've got any, and I'll mind mine!\" \"If I was you,\" the  leftenant says, \"I'd call the captain.\" \"Thank ye,\" says the mate--\"call  the captain for nothing!\" Well, in an hour more the land was quite plain  on the starboard bow, and the mate comes aft again to Leftenant Collins.  The clouds was beginning to grow out of the clear sky astarn too. \"Why,  sir,\" says the mate, \"I'd no notion you was a _seaman_ at all! What  would you do yourself now, supposin' the case you put a little ago?\"  \"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Collins, \"if you'll do it, I'll tell ye at once.\"    At this point of old Jack's story, however, a cabin-boy came from aft,  to say that the captain wanted him. The old seaman knocked the ashes out  of his pipe, which he had smoked at intervals in short puffs, put it in  his jacket-pocket, and got off the windlass end. \"Why, old ship!\" said  the man-o'-war's-man, \"are ye goin' to leave us in the lurch with a  _short yarn_?\" \"Can't help it, bo',\" said Old Jack; \"orders must be  obeyed, ye know,\" and away he went. \"Well, mates,\" said one, \"what was  the up-shot of it, if the yarn's been overhauled already? I didn't hear  it myself.\" \"Blessed if I know,\" said several--\"Old Jack didn't get the  length last time he's got now.\" \"More luck!\" said the man-o-war's-man;  \"'tis to be hoped he'll finish it next time!\"          From Fraser's Magazine for June.
