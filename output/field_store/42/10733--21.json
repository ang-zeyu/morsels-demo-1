The well was very deep, but that did  not matter. Tall soon stretched himself to the required depth, and  searched in all the corners: but he was unable to find the little  fish, and it seemed impossible that it could ever have been there.    \"Now then, get out of that, I will take your place,\" said Broad.    And getting in at the top by the rim, he filled up all the inside of  the well, stopping it so completely with his huge body that the water  sprang out: but nothing was seen of the little fish.    \"Now it is my turn,\" said the Man with Eyes of Flame, \"I warrant I'll  dislodge this clever magician.\"    When Broad had cleared the well of his enormous person the water  returned to its place, but it soon began to boil from the heat of the  eyes of flame. It boiled and boiled, till it boiled over the rim;  then, as it went on boiling and rising ever higher and higher, a  little fish was seen to throw itself out on the grass half cooked. As  it touched the ground it again took the form of the princess.    Matthias went to her and kissed her tenderly.    \"You have conquered, my master and husband,\" she said, \"you have  succeeded in preventing my escape. Henceforth I am yours, both by  right of conquest and of my own free will.\"    The young man's courtesy, strength, and gentleness, as well as his  beauty, were very pleasing to the princess; but her father, the king,  was not so ready to approve of her choice, and he resolved not to let  her go with them. But this did not trouble Matthias, who determined to  carry her off, aided by his three comrades. They soon all left the  palace.    The king was furious, and ordered his guards to follow them and bring  them back under pain of death. Meanwhile Matthias, the princess, and  the three comrades had already travelled a distance of some miles.  When she heard the steps of the pursuers she begged the Man with Eyes  of Flame to see who they were. Having turned to look, he told her that  a large army of men on horseback were advancing at a gallop.    \"They are my father's guards,\" said she, \"we shall have some  difficulty in escaping them.\"    Then, seeing the horsemen draw nearer she took the veil from her face,  and throwing it behind her in the direction of the wind, said, \"I  command as many trees to spring up as there are threads in this veil.\"    Instantly, in the twinkling of an eye, a high thick forest rose up  between them. Before the soldiers had time to clear for themselves a  pathway through this dense mass, Matthias and his party had been able  to get far ahead, and even to take a little rest.    \"Look,\" said the princess, \"and see if they are still coming after  us.\"    The Man with Eyes of Flame looked back, and replied that the king's  guards were out of the forest and coming towards them with all speed.    \"They will not be able to reach us,\" cried she. And she let fall a  tear from her eyes, saying as she did so, \"Tear, become a river.\"    At the same moment a wide river flowed between them and their  pursuers, and before the latter had found means of crossing it,  Matthias and his party were far on in front.    \"Man with Eyes of Flame,\" said the princess, \"look behind and tell me  how closely we are followed.\"    \"They are quite near to us again,\" he replied, \"they are almost upon  our heels.\"    \"Darkness, cover them,\" said she.    At these words Tall drew himself up. He stretched and stretched and  stretched until he reached the clouds, and there, with his hat he half  covered the face of the sun. The side towards the soldiers was black  as night, while Matthias and his party, lit up by the shining half,  went a good way without hindrance.    When they had travelled some distance, Tall uncovered the sun, and  soon joined his companions by taking a mile at each step. They were  already in sight of Matthias' home, when they noticed that the royal  guards were again following them closely.    \"Now it is my turn,\" said Broad; \"go on your way in safety, I will  remain here. I shall be ready for them.\"    He quietly awaited their arrival, standing motionless, with his large  mouth open from ear to ear. The royal army, who were determined not to  turn back without having taken the princess, advanced towards the town  at a gallop. They had decided among themselves that if it resisted  they would lay siege to it.    Mistaking Broad's open mouth for one of the city gates, they all  dashed through and disappeared.    Broad closed his mouth, and having swallowed them, ran to rejoin his  comrades in the palace of Matthias' father. He felt somewhat disturbed  with a whole army inside him, and the earth groaned and trembled  beneath him as he ran. He could hear the shouts of the people  assembled round Matthias, as they rejoiced at his safe return.    \"Ah, here you are at last, brother Broad,\" cried Matthias, directly he  caught sight of him. \"But what have you done with the army? Where have  you left it?\"    \"The army is here, quite safe,\" answered he, patting his enormous  person. \"I shall be very pleased to return them as they are, for the  morsel is not very easy to digest.\"    \"Come then, let them out of their prison,\" said Matthias, enjoying the  joke, and at the same time calling all the inhabitants to assist at  the entertainment.    Broad, who looked upon it as a common occurrence, stood in the middle  of the palace square, and putting his hands to his sides, began to  cough. Then--it was really a sight worth seeing--at each cough  horsemen and horses fell out of his mouth, one over the other,  plunging, hopping, jumping, trying who could get out of the way the  quickest. The last one had a little difficulty in getting free, for he  somehow got into one of Broad's nostrils and was unable to move. It  was only by giving a good sneeze that Broad could release him, the  last of the royal cavaliers, and he lost no time in following his  companions at the top of his speed.    [Illustration]    A few days later a splendid feast was given at the wedding of Prince  Matthias and the princess. The king, her father, was also present.  Tall had been sent to invite him. Owing to his knowledge of the road  and the length of his limbs, he accomplished the journey so quickly  that he was there before the royal horsemen had time to get back. It  was well for them that it was so, for, had he not pleaded that their  lives might be saved, their heads would certainly have been cut off  for returning empty-handed.    Everything was now arranged to everybody's satisfaction. The  princess's father was delighted to know that his daughter was married  to a rich and noble prince, and Matthias generously rewarded his brave  travelling companions, who remained with him to the end of their days.          THE HISTORY OF PRINCE SLUGOBYL OR THE INVISIBLE KNIGHT          [Illustration]    THE HISTORY OF PRINCE SLUGOBYL; OR, THE INVISIBLE KNIGHT      There was once a king who had an only son, called Prince Slugobyl. Now  this young prince loved nothing better than travelling; so fond of it  was he that when he was twenty years old he gave his father no rest  until he allowed him to go on a long journey, in short, to travel all  over the world. Thus he hoped to see many beautiful and strange  things, to meet with marvellous adventures, to gain happiness,  knowledge, and wisdom, and to return a better man in every way than  when he left. Fearing his youth and want of experience might lead him  astray, his father sent with him a valued and faithful servant. When  all was ready, Slugobyl bade the king adieu and set off to visit the  land of his dreams.    As he was jogging along, allowing his horse to go at its own pace, he  saw a beautiful white swan pursued by an eagle about to pounce down  upon it. Seizing his crossbow, he took such good aim that the eagle  fell dead at his feet. The rescued swan stopped in its flight, and  turning round said to him, \"Valiant Prince Slugobyl, it is not a mere  swan who thanks you for your most timely help, but the daughter of the  Invisible Knight, who, to escape the pursuit of the giant Kostey, has  changed herself into a swan. My father will gladly be of service to  you in return for this kindness to me. When in need of his help, you  only have to say three times, 'Invisible Knight, come to me.'\"    Having thus spoken the swan flew away. The prince looked after her for  a long time, and then continued his journey. He travelled on and on  and on, over high mountains, through dark forests, across barren  deserts, and so to the middle of a vast plain where every green thing  had been burnt up by the rays of the sun. Not a single tree, not even  a bush or a plant of any kind was to be seen. No bird was heard to  sing, no insect to hum, no breath of air to stir the stillness of this  land of desolation. Having ridden for some hours, the prince began to  suffer terribly from thirst; so, sending his servant in one direction,  he himself went in another, in search of some well or spring. They  soon found a well full of cool fresh water, but unluckily without  either rope or bucket to draw it up. After a few moments' thought the  prince said to his servant, \"Take the leathern strap used for  tethering our horses, put it round your body, and I will then let you  down into the well; I cannot endure this thirst any longer.\"    \"Your highness,\" answered the servant, \"I am heavier than you, and you  are not as strong as I, so you will not be able to pull me out of the  water. If you, therefore, will go down first, I shall be able to pull  you up when you have quenched your thirst.\"    The prince took his advice, and fastening an end of the strap under  his arms, was lowered into the well. When he had enjoyed a deep  draught of the clear water and filled a bottle of the same for his  servant, he gave the signal that he wished to be pulled up. But  instead of obeying the servant said, \"Listen, prince; from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#17)"],[1," any  creature in the world; the same thing may be said of the elephant,  which, next to the dog, lends himself most obediently to the  requirements of the master. Owing to the power of his huge body and to  the ease with which he wins his food, he is in his native wilds the  least dependent of land animals. Except from the assaults of man, he  has nothing to fear; yet when enslaved he at once surrenders himself  to his captors. In general, it may be said that the true gauge of  domesticability is the sympathetic motive, that strange outgoing  spirit which leads the mind to recognize the life about it and to  accept that life as a part of its own. In other words, the  domesticability of man is due to his willingness to enter into social  relations and rests on the same foundation that supports his  intercourse with the lower animals he has won to his use.    [Illustration: Indian Bullock and Water-Carrier]    It is probable that the first use which was made of beasts of burden,  in ways in which their strength became useful to man, was in packing  the tents and other valuables of their masters as they moved from  place to place. Even to this day in certain parts of the world bulls  and oxen serve for such purposes. In fact the nomadic life, a fashion  of society which is enforced wherever people subsist from their  cattle alone, leads inevitably to such use of the beasts. In the  southern Appalachian district of this country there remain traces of  this service rendered by bulls and oxen. These creatures, provided  with a kind of pack saddle, are occasionally used in conveying the  dried roots of the ginseng, beeswax, feathers, and the peltries which  are gathered by the inhabitants of remote districts, not accessible  to carriages, to the markets of the outer world. All the varieties of  ordinary cattle could be made to serve as burden-carriers, and they  doubtless would be continued to be used for saddle purposes in one  way or another but for the wide use of the horse, a creature very  much better adapted for carrying weight. The cloven foot of the bulls  and buffaloes gives a weakness to the extremities which will quickly  lead to disease in case they are forced to carry heavy loads such  as the horse or ass may safely bear.    [Illustration: Ploughing in Syria]    The help which our bovine servants afford us by the power which they  exert in traction, as in drawing ploughs, sleds, or wagons, appears to  have been first rendered long after their introduction to the ways of  man. The first of these uses in which the drawing strength of these  animals was made serviceable appears to have been in the work of  ploughing. In primitive days and with primitive tools, hand delving  was a sore task. The inventive genius who first contrived to overturn  the earth by means of the forked limb of a tree, shaped in the  semblance of a plough and drawn by oxen, began a great revolution in  the art of agriculture. To this unknown genius we may award a place  among the benefactors of mankind, quite as distinguished as that which  is occupied by the equally unknown inventors of the arts of making fire  or of smelting ores. After the experience with the strength of oxen had  been won from the work of ploughing, it was easy to pass to the other  grades of their employment, where they were made to draw carriages.    Next after the contribution which the kindred of the bulls, have made  by their strength, we must set that which has come from their milk.  Although this substance can be obtained in small quantities from  several other domesticated animals, the species of the genus Bos alone  have yielded it in sufficient quantities greatly to affect the  development of man. It is difficult to measure the importance of the  addition to the diet, both of savage and civilized peoples, which milk  affords. It is a fact well known to physiologists that in its simple  form this substance is a complete food, capable when taken alone of  sustaining life and insuring a full development of the body. It is  indeed a natural contrivance exactly adapted to afford those materials  which are required for the development and restoration of creatures  essentially akin to our own species. Those races which avail themselves  extensively of it in their dietary are the strongest and most enduring  the world has known. The Aryan folk are indeed characteristically  drinkers of milk and users of its products, cheese and butter. It may  well be that their power is in some measure due to this resource.    [Illustration: Winnowing Grain in Egypt]    In our horned cattle man won to domestication creatures which were  admirably suited to promote his advancement from savagery to  civilization. Indeed, the possession of these animals appears to have  been a prime condition of his advancement. With them, however, as with  the camel, there came little in the way of those sympathetic qualities  which have made it possible for our race to establish affectionate  relations with other captive forms. Long intercourse with man has, it  is true, somewhat diminished the wildness of these creatures, though  the males remain the most indomitably ferocious of all our  servants. The truth seems to be that the bovine animals have but  little intellectual capacity, and it has in no wise served the  purposes of man to develop such powers of mind as they have. We have  ever been given to asking little of them, save docility. This we have  in a high measure won with our milch cows, which of all our  domesticated creatures are perhaps the most absolutely submissive; the  more highly developed of them being little more than passive producers  of milk, almost without a trace of instincts or emotions except such  as pertain to reproduction and to feeding. It is a noteworthy fact  that in all the great literature of anecdote concerning our  domesticated animals, there is hardly a trace of stories which tend to  show the existence of sagacity in our common cattle.    It is evident that the variability of our domesticated bovines, as far  as their bodies are concerned, is very great. Between the ancient  aurochs and the more highly cultivated of its descendants, the  difference is as great as that which separates any other of our captive  animals from their wild ancestors. In size, shape, in flesh-and  milk-giving qualities, the departure from the old form of the wilderness  is remarkable. Moreover, at the present time these diverse breeds of  horned cattle are rapidly being multiplied, the distinctive forms  probably being twice as numerous as they were at the beginning of the  present century. The process of selection has led to some very wide  diversifications of the body. The horns, which in the wild state are  invariably well developed, and which in the cattle of our Western plains  attain very great size, have in certain breeds altogether disappeared,  and in their place there sometimes comes a remarkable crest of bony  matter which does not project beyond the skin which covers the head. If  such differences occurred in the wild state, they would be regarded as  separating the two types of animals widely from each other.    [Illustration: Egyptian Sheep]    In treating the wool-bearing animals along with beasts of burden, we  make a somewhat fanciful classification which yet is not quite without  reason. By long training man has brought these species to the state  where their covering of wool or hair, once a coating only sufficient to  afford protection from the weather, has become a very serious load. In  certain of our highly developed varieties the annual coat is so far  increased that the creature loses a large part of its bulk after the  shearer has done his work. Each year's fleece often amounts in weight  to eight to twelve pounds, and in its lifetime the animal may yield a  mass of wool far exceeding its weight of flesh and bones in any time  of its life. When the fleece is mature the animal is often burdened  with a load about as heavy in proportion to his size as is a horse by  the weight of its rider and accoutrements.    As a flesh producer, particularly in sterile fields, sheep are more  valuable than our horned cattle. They mature more rapidly, attaining  their adult size and reproducing their kind in less than two years, so  that in many parts of the world it is possible to obtain a larger  quantity of flesh from poor pasturages with sheep than with any other  of our domesticated animals. Their principal value, however, has been  from the means they afforded whereby men in high latitudes have  obtained warm clothing. Before the domestication of these creatures,  peoples who had to endure the winter of high latitudes were forced to  rely upon hides for covering--a form of clothing which is clumsy,  uncleanly, and which the chase could not supply in any considerable  quantity. Owing to its peculiar structure, the hair of the sheep makes  the strongest and warmest covering, when rendered into cloth, which has  ever been devised for the use of man. The value of this contribution is  directly related to the conditions of climate. In the intertropical  regions the sheep plays no part of importance. In high latitudes it is  of the utmost value to man. No other of our domesticated creatures,  except the camel, is so specially adapted to the needs which  peculiarities of climate impose upon their possessors.    [Illustration: Bedouin Goat-Herd--Palestine]    The relations of the goat to mankind are in certain ways peculiar. The  creature has long been subjugated, probably having come into the human  family before the dawn of history. It has been almost as widely  disseminated, among barbarian and civilized peoples alike, as the  sheep. It readily cleaves to the household, and exhibits much more  intelligence than the other members of our flocks and herds. It yields  good milk, the flesh is edible, though in the old animals not savory,  and the hair can be made to vary in"]]]
