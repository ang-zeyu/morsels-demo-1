[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24062"],[0,"A History of the United States (#17)"],[1," elected to that office under a President representing everything to  which he was opposed.    John Adams was an honest man and sincerely loved his country. There his  merits ended. He was readily quarrelsome, utterly without judgment and  susceptible to that mood of panic in which mediocre persons are readily  induced to act the \"strong man.\" During his administration a new quarrel  arose with France--a quarrel in which once again those responsible for  that country's diplomacy played the game of her enemies. Genet had  merely been an impracticable and impatient enthusiast. Talleyrand, who  under the Directory took charge of foreign affairs, was a scamp; and,  clever as he was, was unduly contemptuous of America, where he had  lived for a time in exile. He attempted to use the occasion of the  appearance of an American Mission in Paris to wring money out of  America, not only for the French Treasury, but for his own private  profit and that of his colleagues and accomplices. A remarkable  correspondence, which fully revealed the blackmailing attempt made by  the agents of the French Government on the representatives of the United  States, known as the \"X.Y.Z.\" letters, was published and roused the  anger of the whole country. \"Millions for defence but not a cent for  tribute\" was the universal catchword. Hamilton would probably have  seized the opportunity to go to war with France with some likelihood of  a national backing. Adams avoided war and thereby split his party, but  he did not avoid steps far more certain than a war to excite the  hostility of democratic America. His policy was modelled upon the worst  of the panic-bred measures by means of which Pitt and his colleagues  were seeking to suppress \"Jacobinism\" in England. Such a policy was  odious anywhere; in a democracy it was also insane. Further the Aliens  Law and the Sedition Law which he induced Congress to pass were in  flagrant and obvious violation of the letter and spirit of the  Constitution. They were barely through Congress when the storm broke on  their authors. Jefferson, in retirement at Monticello, saw that his hour  was come. He put himself at the head of the opposition and found a whole  nation behind him.    Kentucky, carved out of the western territory and newly grown to  Statehood, took the lead of resistance. For her legislature Jefferson  drafted the famous \"Kentucky Resolutions,\" which condemned the new laws  as unconstitutional (which they were) and refused to allow them to be  administered within her borders. On the strength of these resolutions  Jefferson has been described as the real author of the doctrine of  \"Nullification\": and technically this may be true. Nevertheless there is  all the difference in the world between the spirit of the Kentucky  Resolutions and that of \"Nullification,\" as South Carolina afterwards  proclaimed its legitimacy. About the former there was nothing sectional.  It was not pretended that Kentucky had any peculiar and local objection  to the Sedition Law, or was standing against the other States in  resisting it. She was vindicating a freedom common to all the States,  valued by all and menaced in all. She claimed that she was making  herself the spokesman of the other States in the same fashion as Hampden  made himself the spokesman of the other great landed proprietors in  resisting taxation by the Crown.    The event amply justified her claim. The oppression laws which the  Federalists had induced Congress to pass were virtually dead letters  from the moment of their passing. And when the time came for the nation  to speak, it rose as one man and flung Adams from his seat. The  Federalist party virtually died of the blow. The dream of an  oligarchical Republic was at an end, and the will of the people,  expressed with unmistakable emphasis, gave the Chief Magistracy to the  author of the Declaration of Independence.                                         CHAPTER V                             THE VIRGINIAN DYNASTY      I have spoken of Jefferson's election as if it had been a direct act of  the people; and morally it was so. But in the actual proceedings there  was a certain hitch, which is of interest not only because it  illustrated a peculiar technical defect in the original Constitution and  so led to its amendment, but because it introduces here, for the first  time, the dubious but not unfascinating figure of Aaron Burr.    Burr was a politician of a type which democracies will always produce,  and which those who dislike democracy will always use for its reproach.  Yet the reproach is evidently unjust. In all societies, most of those  who meddle with the government of men will do so in pursuit of their own  interests, and in all societies the professional politician will reveal  himself as a somewhat debased type. In a despotism he will become a  courtier and obtain favour by obsequious and often dishonourable  services to a prince. In an old-fashioned oligarchy he will adopt the  same attitude towards some powerful noble. In a parliamentary  plutocracy, like our own, he will proceed in fashion with which we are  only too familiar, will make himself the paid servant of those wealthy  men who finance politicians, and will enrich himself by means of \"tips\"  from financiers and bribes from Government contractors. In a democracy,  the same sort of man will try to obtain his ends by flattering and  cajoling the populace. It is not obvious that he is more mischievous as  demagogue than he was as courtier, lackey, or parliamentary intriguer.  Indeed, he is almost certainly less so, for he must at least in some  fashion serve, even if only that he may deceive them, those whose  servant he should be. At any rate, the purely self-seeking demagogue is  certainly a recurrent figure in democratic politics, and of the  self-seeking demagogue Aaron Burr was an excellent specimen.    He had been a soldier not without distinction, and to the last he  retained a single virtue--the grand virtue of courage. For the rest, he  was the Tammany Boss writ large. An able political organizer, possessed  of much personal charm, he had made himself master of the powerful  organization of the Democratic party in New York State, and as such was  able to bring valuable support to the party which was opposing the  administration of Adams. As a reward for his services, it was determined  that he should be Democratic candidate for the Vice-Presidency. But here  the machinery devised by the Convention played a strange trick. When the  votes of the Electoral College came to be counted, it was found that  instead of Jefferson leading and yet leaving enough votes to give Burr  the second place, the votes for the two were exactly equal. This, under  the Constitution, threw the decision into the hands of the House of  Representatives, and in that House the Federalists still held the  balance of power. They could not choose their own nominee, but they  could choose either Jefferson or Burr, and many of them, desiring at the  worst to frustrate the triumph of their great enemy, were disposed to  choose Burr; while Burr, who cared only for his own career, was ready  enough to lend himself to such an intrigue.    That the intrigue failed was due mainly to the patriotism of Hamilton.  All that was best and worst in him concurred in despising the mere  flatterer of the mob. Jefferson was at least a gentleman. And, unfairly  as he estimated him both morally and intellectually, he knew very well  that the election of Jefferson would not be a disgrace to the Republic,  while the election of Burr would. His patriotism overcame his  prejudices. He threw the whole weight of his influence with the  Federalists against the intrigue, and he defeated it. It is the more to  his honour that he did this to the advantage of a man whom he could not  appreciate and who was his enemy. It was the noblest and purest act of  his public career. It probably cost him his life.    Jefferson was elected President and Burr Vice-President, as had  undoubtedly been intended by the great majority of those who had voted  the Democratic ticket at the elections. But the anomaly and disaster of  Burr's election had been so narrowly avoided that a change in the  Constitution became imperative. It was determined that henceforward the  votes for President and Vice-President should be given separately. The  incident had another consequence. Burr, disappointed in hopes which had  almost achieved fulfilment, became from that moment a bitter enemy of  Jefferson and his administration. Also, attributing the failure of his  promising plot to Hamilton's intervention, he hated Hamilton with a new  and insatiable hatred. Perhaps in that hour he already determined that  his enemy should die.    Jefferson's inauguration was full of that deliberate and almost  ceremonial contempt of ceremony in which that age found a true  expression of its mood, though later and perhaps more corrupt times have  inevitably found such symbolism merely comic. It was observed as  striking the note of the new epoch that the President rejected all that  semi-regal pomp which Washington and Adams had thought necessary to the  dignity of their office. It is said that he not only rode alone into  Washington (he was the first President to be inaugurated in the newly  built capital), dressed like any country gentleman, but, when he  dismounted to take the oath, tethered his horse with his own hands. More  really significant was the presence of the populace that elected  him--the great heaving, unwashed crowd elbowing the dainty politicians  in the very presence chamber. The President's inaugural address was full  of a generous spirit of reconciliation. \"We are all Republicans,\" he  said, \"we are all Federalists.\" Every difference of opinion was not a  difference of principle, nor need such differences interfere with \"our  attachment, to our Union and to representative government.\"    Such liberality"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#17)"],[1,"alea; 9. ovary, stamens and lodicules; 10. a bit  of the bristle showing the reversed barbs.]    This grass grows in shady places in very rich soils generally and is  abundant in shady nooks and corners where there are rubbish heaps.    _Distribution._--Throughout India and Ceylon.        9. Pennisetum, _Pers._    These are annual or perennial grasses. Leaves are usually narrow. The  inflorescence is a spike-like raceme consisting of involucellate  clusters of shortly pedicellate spikelets, involucels consist of  unequal, simple or branched bristles. Spikelets are obovoid or  lanceolate, 1- to 2-flowered, persistent on their stalks, one to three  in an involucel. There are usually four glumes in a spikelet. The first  glume is minute or absent. The second glume is shorter than the third,  membranous, 3- to 5-nerved, rarely wanting. The third glume is as long  as the fourth, lanceolate, paleate or not, male or empty.

The _second glume_ is about 1/3 the length of the third  glume, lanceolate, acuminate, 3-nerved. The _third glume_ is about 1/3  inch long, lanceolate, acuminate, 7- to 11-nerved, epaleate and with  infolded margins. The _fourth glume_ is a little longer than the third,  lanceolate, acuminate, with infolded margins 5- or 6-nerved, paleate and  enclosing a complete flower. The _palea_ is lanceolate, acuminate, as  long as the glume. There are three _stamens_ with long, narrow, yellow  anthers. _Stigmas_ are feathery. _Lodicules_ are either absent or very  minute.    This is a very coarse grass usually growing in stiff soils especially  near wet places.    _Distribution._--Occurs all over Southern India both on the plains and  on low hills.    [Illustration: Fig. 115.--Pennisetum cenchroides.]      =Pennisetum cenchroides, _Rich._=    This grass is a perennial. It consists of aerial branches and  underground rhizomiferous stems, bearing thick fibrous roots and  numerous buds covered by scarious sheaths. The aerial branches are  tufted, erect or decumbent and geniculately ascending when in flower,  much branched from the base, 6 to 24 inches long (under favourable  conditions may reach even 3 to 4 feet in length).    The _leaf-sheath_ is slightly compressed, keeled, with scattered long  hairs outside, shorter than the internodes. The _ligule_ is a short thin  membrane fringed with hairs.    The _leaf-blade_ is linear, tapering to a very fine point 1-1/2 to 6  inches (sometimes 18 to 20 inches) by 1/8 to 1/4 inch scaberulous with  fine long tubercle-based deciduous hairs scattered above, and the lower  surface glabrous or with a few distantly scattered fine long hairs,  broad at the base and constricted at the point of junction with the  sheath.    The _inflorescence_ is a raceme of spikes, varying from 1-1/2 to 3-1/2  inches, with the spikes mostly densely arranged, though occasionally  distant and not close-set, on a long; slender, puberulous or scaberulous  peduncle; _rachis_ is flexuous, flattened, grooved and scaberulous. The  _spikes_ have involucels, consisting of two series of bristles, the  outer bristles are horizontal or reflexed, numerous, fine, filiform,  scabrid and purple above, shorter or longer than the spikelets; the  inner bristles are two to three times longer than the spikelets,  flattened and thickened at the base with a strong green nerve, ciliated  with long tubercle-based hairs; one of the bristles is longer than the  others and the bases of the bristles are connate at the very base into a  ring; the upper portion of the bristles are filiform, scabrid and  purple, the lower flattened portion being pale.

A portion of a spike; 2 and 3. spikelets with their involucels; 4. a  bristle; 5, 6, 7 and 8. the first, second, third and the fourth glume,  respectively; 7a and 8a. palea of the third and the fourth glume,  respectively; 9. ovary and stamens.]    _Spikelets_ are about 1/5 inch long oblong-lanceolate, one to three in a  spike and sessile.    There are four _glumes_ in a spikelet. The _first glume_ is small,  hyaline, ovate-lanceolate, acute, nerveless or sometimes 1-nerved. The  _second glume_ is a little longer than the first, ovate, acute, about  half of the third glume, hyaline, 1 to 3-nerved. The _third glume_ is  ovate-lanceolate, acuminate, generally 5- to 7-nerved, paleate, usually  male; _palea_ is lanceolate, equal to or slightly shorter than the  glume. The _fourth glume_ is as long as the third with a broad hyaline  margin, 5-nerved paleate; palea as long as the glume. _Anthers_ are  three, yellow, _stigmas_ white, feathery and the styles shortly united  at the base. _Lodicules_ are not present.    This is the famous Kolakattai grass (Tamil) of the Coimbatore District  and it grows in all kinds of soil and is capable of growing even when  the soil is dry. It is readily eaten by cattle, sheep, goat and when  once established is not easily killed out even by prolonged droughts. It  is in flower in June, November and December.    _Distribution._--Fairly common in South India and Western India. Said to  occur in Tropical Africa also.    There is a variety of this grass named _echinoides_. This differs from  the type in the following respects--the inner bristles are united very  much above the base and much thickened and stiffer than in the type.  (See fig. 116-3)        10. Cenchrus, _L._    The inflorescences are spike-like racemes, consisting of involucellate  clusters of shortly pedicelled spikelets jointed on a simple rachis. The  involucel consists of hardened spike-like bristles connate at the base  into a short coriaceous cup, which is surrounded by erect or squarrose  bristles. Spikelets one to three in each involucel, persistent, 1- to  2-flowered, with three or four glumes. The first glume is very small or  absent. The second and the third glumes are subequal 5- to 7-nerved. The  third glume is longer than the second with male flower or not, paleate.  The fourth glume is coriaceous, with a bisexual or female flower.  Lodicules are two. Stamens are three. Styles are long, free or connate  below. Grain is broad, oblong and compressed.

C. catharticus.      =Cenchrus biflorus, _Roxb._=    This is an annual with erect simple stems, 6 to 24 inches long.    The _leaf-sheath_ is glabrous or nearly so, with hairs at the mouth.    The _leaf-blade_ is linear-lanceolate, finely acuminate, glabrous or  hairy, 3 to 10 inches long and 1/8 to 3/8 inch broad.    The _inflorescence_ is a solitary cylindric raceme of involucels, 2 to 4  inches long, enclosed in the uppermost leaf-sheath; the _rachis_ is  flexuous, angular and smooth. _Involucels_ usually with two, rarely  three spikelets, loosely imbricate, rounded at the base; the inner  bristles are erect, dorsally flat, subulate-lanceolate, puberulous and  with thickened margins, about 1/8 inch long. The outer are shorter than  the inner, glabrous, erect or subsquarrose and as long as the sessile  spikelets.    The _spikelets_ are about 1/6 inch long, sub-globose, with four  _glumes_. The _first glume_ is about 1/10 inch long, ovate-acuminate,  very thin, hyaline, nerveless or rarely 1-nerved. The _second glume_ is  broadly ovate, 1/6 inch long, hyaline, acute, 1-nerved. The _third  glume_ is slightly longer than the second, oblong-ovate, apiculate,  5-nerved and paleate; _palea_ 1/8 inch obtuse. The _fourth glume_ is as  long as the third, ovate, obtuse, paleate. _Anthers_ are three. _Styles_  free almost to the base. The grain is 1/12 by 1/16 inch orbicular  oblong, compressed, smooth and pale brown.    [Illustration: Fig. 117.--Cenchrus biflorus.    1.
