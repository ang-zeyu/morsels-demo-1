The only light came through these narrow holes, so on dark  days the people needed the fire as much for light as for warmth.    _Foster-father._ A Norse father sent his children away from home to grow  up. They went when they were three or four years old and stayed until  they were grown. The father thought: \"They will be better so. If they  stayed at home, their mother would spoil them with much petting.\"    _Foster-brothers._ When two men loved each other very much they said,  \"Let us become foster-brothers.\"    Then they went and cut three long pieces of turf and put a spear into  the ground so that it held up the strips of turf like an arch. Runes  were cut on the handle of the spear, telling the duties of  foster-brothers. The two men walked under this arch, and each made a  little cut in his palm. They knelt and clasped hands, so that the blood  of the two flowed together, and they said, \"Now we are of one blood.\"    Then each made this vow: \"I will fight for my foster-brother whenever he  shall need me. If he is killed before I am, I will punish the man who  did it. Whatever things I own are as much my foster-brother's as mine. I  will love this man until I die. I call Odin and Thor and all the gods to  hear my vow. May they hate me if I break it!\"    _Ran._ Ran was the wife of Aegir, who was god of the sea. They lived in  a cave at the bottom of the ocean. Ran had a great net, and she caught  in it all men who were shipwrecked and took them to her cave. She also  caught all the gold and rich treasures that went down in ships. So her  cave was filled with shining things.    _Valkyrias._ These were the maidens of Odin. They waited on the table in  Valhalla. But whenever a battle was being fought they rode through the  air on their horses and watched to see what warriors were brave enough  to go to Valhalla. Sometimes during the fight a man would think that he  saw the Valkyrias. Then he was glad; for he knew that he would go to  Valhalla.    An old Norse story says this about the Valkyrias: \"With lightning around  them, with bloody shirts of mail, and with shining spears they ride  through the air and the ocean. When their horses shake their manes, dew  falls on the deep valleys and hail on the high forests.\"    _Odin's Ravens._ Odin had a great throne in his palace in Asgard. When  he sat in it he could look all over the world. But it was so far to see  that he could not tell all of the things that were happening. So he had  two ravens to help him. An old Norse story tells this about them: \"Two  ravens sit on Odin's shoulders and whisper in his ears all that they  have heard and seen. He sends them out at dawn of day to see over the  whole world. They return at evening near meal time. This is why Odin  knows so many things.\"    _Reykjavik._ Reykjavik means \"smoky sea.\" Ingolf called it that because  of the steaming hot-springs by the sea. The place is still called  Reykjavik. A little city has grown up there, the only city in Iceland.  It is the capital of the country.    _Peace-bands._ A Norseman always carried his sword, even at a feast; for  he did not know when he might need it. But when he went somewhere on an  errand of peace and had no quarrel he tied his sword into its scabbard  with white bands that he called peace-bands. If all at once something  happened to make him need his sword, he broke the peace-bands and drew  it out.    _Eskimos._ Now, the Eskimos live in Greenland and Alaska and on the very  northern shores of Canada. But once they lived farther south in  pleasanter lands. After a while the other Indian tribes began to grow  strong. Then they wanted the pleasant land of the Eskimos and the  seashore that the Eskimos had. So they fought again and again with those  people and won and drove them farther north and farther north. At last  the Eskimos were on the very shores of the cold sea, with the Indians  still pushing them on. So some of them got into their boats and rowed  across the narrow water and came to Greenland and lived there. Some  people think that these things happened before Eric found Greenland. In  that case he found Eskimos there; and Thorfinn saw red Indians in  Wineland. Other people think that this happened after Eric went to  Greenland. If that is true, he found an empty land, and it was Eskimos  that Thorfinn saw in Wineland.      FOOTNOTES:    [16] See note about Valkyrias on page 198.          Suggestions _to_ Teachers      Possibly this book seems made up of four or five disconnected stories.  They are, however, strung upon one thread,--the westward emigration from  Norway. The story of Harald is intended to serve in two ways towards the  working out of this plot. It gives the general setting that continues  throughout the book in costume, houses, ideals, habits. It explains the  cause of the emigration from the mother country. It is really an  introductory chapter. As for the other stories, they are distinctly  steps in the progress of the plot. A chain of islands loosely connects  Norway with America,--Orkneys and Shetlands, Faroes, Iceland, Greenland.  It was from link to link of this chain that the Norsemen sailed in  search of home and adventure. Discoveries were made by accident. Ships  were driven by the wind from known island to unknown. These two  points,--the island connection that made possible the long voyage from  Norway to America, and the contribution of storm to discovery,--I have  stated in the book only dramatically. I emphasize them here, hoping that  the teacher will make sure that the children see them, and possibly that  they state them abstractly.    Let me speak as to the proper imaging of the stories. I have not often  interrupted incident with special description, not because I do not  consider the getting of vivid and detailed images most necessary to full  enjoyment and to proper intellectual habits, but because I trusted to  the pictures of this book and to the teacher to do what seemed to me  inartistic to do in the story. Some of these descriptions and  explanations I have introduced into the book in the form of notes,  hoping that the children in turning to them might form a habit of  insisting upon full understanding of a point, and might possibly, with  the teacher's encouragement, begin the habit of reference reading.    The landscape of Norway, Iceland, and Greenland is wonderful and will  greatly assist in giving reality and definiteness to the stories.  Materials for this study are not difficult of access. Foreign colored  photographs of Norwegian landscape are becoming common in our art  stores. There are good illustrations in the geographical works referred  to in the book list. These could be copied upon the blackboard. There  are three books beautifully illustrated in color that it will be  possible to find only in large libraries,--\"Coast of Norway,\" by Walton;  \"Travels in the Island of Iceland,\" by Mackenzie; \"Voyage en Islande et  au Greenland,\" by J. P. Gaimard. If the landscape is studied from the  point of view of formation, the images will be more accurate and more  easily gained, and the study will have a general value that will  continue past the reading of these stories into all work in geography.    Trustworthy pictures of Norse houses and costumes are difficult to  obtain. In \"Viking Age\" and \"Story of Norway,\" by Boyesen (G. P.  Putnam's Sons, New York), are many copies of Norse antiquities in the  fashion of weapons, shield-bosses, coins, jewelry, wood-carving. These  are, of course, accurate, but of little interest to children. Their  chief value lies in helping the teacher to piece together a picture that  she can finally give to her pupils.    Metal-working and wood-carving were the most important arts of the  Norse. If children study products of these arts and actually do some of  the work, they will gain a quickened sympathy with the people and an  appreciation of their power. They may, perhaps, make something to merely  illustrate Norse work; for instance, a carved ship's-head, or a copper  shield, or a wrought door-nail. But, better, they may apply Norse ideas  of form and decoration and Norse processes in making some modern thing  that they can actually use; for instance, a carved wood pin-tray or a  copper match holder. This work should lead out into a study of these  same industries among ourselves with visits to wood-working shops and  metal foundries.    Frequent drawn or painted illustration by the children of costumes,  landscapes, houses, feast halls, and ships will help to make these  images clear. But dramatization will do more than anything else for the  interpreting of the stories and the characters. It would be an excellent  thing if at last, through the dramatization and the handwork, the  children should come into sufficient understanding and enthusiasm to  turn skalds and compose songs in the Norse manner. This requires only a  small vocabulary and a rough feeling for simple rhythm, but an intensity  of emotion and a great vividness of image.    These Norse stories have, to my thinking, three values. The men, with  the crude courage and the strange adventures that make a man interesting  to children, have at the same time the love of truth, the hardy  endurance, the faithfulness to plighted word, that make them a child's  fit companions. Again, in form and in matter old Norse literature is  well worth our reading. I should deem it a great thing accomplished if  the children who read these stories should so be tempted after a while  to read those fine old books, to enjoy the tales, to appreciate  straightforwardness and simplicity of style. The historical value of the  story of Leif Ericsson and the others seems to me to be not to learn the  fact that Norsemen discovered America before Columbus did, but to gain a  conception of the conditions of early navigation, of the length of the  voyage, of the dangers of the sea, and a consequent realization of the  reason for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24821"],[0,"Diamond Dyke (#17)"],[1," cried Emson, leaning forward to grasp his brother's  shoulder.  \"I did not know of this.\"    \"No, you couldn't know of it, but you were precious hard upon me.\"    \"My dear old chap, I spoke to you like a brute.  I ought not to have  left you, but I was so delighted with the way in which you had brought  down the game, and, as it were, filled our larder, that I thought you  ought to have all the honour of keeping guard, while I played drudge and  went to fetch the sledge to carry the meat home.  But tell me: the lions  came?\"    \"One did,\" said Dyke, \"and gave me turn enough, and when I got away from  him to try and catch Breezy here, another savage brute hunted me and  nearly struck me down.  Oh, it was horrid!\" he cried, as he ended his  rough narrative of what he had gone through.    \"Dyke, old chap, I shall never forgive myself,\" said Emson, grasping his  brother's hand.  \"I'd do anything to recall my words.\"    \"Oh, it's all right,\" cried the boy, clinging to the hand that pressed  his; \"I'm better now.  I was so exhausted, Joe, that I suppose I  couldn't keep awake.  I say, how was it I didn't fall off?\"    \"The cob was standing quite still when I came up, and looked half asleep  himself.\"    \"Poor old Breezy!  He had such a fright too.  I thought I should never  catch up to him.  But I did.\"    \"Can you forgive me, old fellow?\"    \"Can I what?  Oh, I say, Joe!  Don't say any more, please.  Here, give  me some cartridges to put in my pocket.  I'm all right now, and there  are sure to be some more lions there.  But, I say, I don't think I  should like to shoot at that first one.\"    Emson handed a dozen cartridges, and then shouted to Jack to stop, which  the Kaffir and his two dumb companions willingly did.    \"What are you going to do, Joe?\"    \"Discretion is the better part of valour,\" said Emson quietly.  \"It  would be dark by the time we got there, and on your own showing, the  field is in possession of the enemy.  Why, Dyke, old fellow, it would be  about as mad a thing as we could do to drive a couple of bullocks up to  where perhaps half-a-dozen lions are feasting.  I ought to have known  better, but it did not occur to me.  These brutes must have been  following the herds.  There's only one thing to do.\"    \"What's that?  Go near and fire to scare them away?\"    \"To come back again, after they had left us the mangled remains of the  eland.  No good, Dyke: we shall be safer in our own beds.  It's only  another failure, old chap.  Never mind: we may get game to-morrow.\"    Dyke tried to oppose this plan of giving up, but it was only in a  half-hearted way, and they rode back slowly towards Kopfontein, pausing  from time to time for the oxen to catch up, Jack growing more and more  uneasy as the night came on, and running after them and leaving the  oxen, if they came to be any distance ahead.    The result was that he was sent on first with the slow-paced bullocks,  and Dyke and his brother formed themselves into a rearguard,  necessitated from time to time to come to a full stop, so as to keep in  the rear.    It was nearly morning when they reached home, and after fastening their  cattle safely behind fence and rail, they sought their own beds, where  Dyke sank at once into a heavy sleep, waking up when the sun was quite  high, with some of the previous evening's confusion left; but the whole  of the day's adventure came back in a flash as his eyes lit upon Duke,  fast asleep upon a skin, and with the lost cartridge pouch between his  paws.        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    JACK BEHAVES HIMSELF.    The necessity for providing fresh provisions took the brothers out again  next day, but there were no more herds visible, as far as their glass  would show, anywhere out upon the plain; but at last they caught sight  of half-a-dozen of the graceful little springboks, and after a long  gallop got close enough to try a couple of shots, which proved  successful; and a little buck was borne home in triumph, a portion  cooked, and Dyke sat watching his brother eat that evening, till Emson  looked up.    \"Why, hullo!\" he cried; \"not well?\"    \"Oh yes, I'm quite right,\" replied Dyke hastily.    \"Then why don't you eat?\"    \"Because I wanted you to make up for the past,\" said the boy, laughing.  \"I'm a meal ahead of you.  I had such a splendid dinner yesterday off  the eland.\"    Next morning, upon their visit to the ostrich-pens, Emson's face  brightened, for there was excitement among the birds, the great hen  having hatched every egg of those they had brought home in the net; and  for the next few days everything possible was done in the way of  feeding, so as to help the young brood on into a state of strength.    \"Oh, it's all right, Joe,\" said Dyke; \"all we've got to do is to keep on  scouring the plain and finding nests.  We shall succeed after all.\"    \"Yes, but you must scout off after some meal and coffee; we can't get on  without those.\"    \"And sugar.\"    \"And sugar.  What do you say to starting to-morrow?\"    \"I'm ready,\" said Dyke; and after warning Jack, and making the necessary  preparations over night, they sought their couches, and rose before  daybreak to go and rouse up the Kaffir and his wife.    The latter soon had her fire glowing; Jack grumpily fetched water, and  then proceeded to yoke the bullocks to the wagon, after which he settled  down to his breakfast; and after feeding his stock, Emson mounted his  horse to ride a few miles with his brother, both keeping a sharp lookout  for game; while Duke, who was of the party, kept on hunting through the  hushes, and now and then starting a bird.    It was getting toward mid-day before anything was shot, and then another  little springbok fell to Emson's piece, just as they reached the water  where they were to make their first halt.    The buck was divided, part to go back to Kopfontein and some to form  part of Dyke's provision, while another portion was cooked at once and  eaten.    \"There,\" said Emson at last, \"I don't think I need say any more to you,  old fellow.  Jack knows the way well enough.  Set him to drive the  bullocks, and you ride beside and drive him.  Keep a tight rein, and if  he shows his teeth and isn't obedient, tell him you'll shoot him, and  take aim at once, or he won't believe you.\"    \"Rather sharp practice, Joe, isn't it?\"    \"Not with a man like that.  He'll be ready to play upon you in every  way, and you must let him see that you do not mean to be imposed upon.  Sounds harsh, but I know Master Jack by heart.\"    \"You do think he'll take me straight to all the water?\"    \"I haven't a doubt about it, old fellow,\" said Emson, smiling.  \"Jack  isn't an ostrich, and must drink at least once a day, so you need not be  nervous about that.--There,\" he continued, mounting; \"I must be off.  Good-bye.\"    \"Not yet; I'm going to ride a little way back with you,\" cried Dyke.    \"No, you are not, lad.  Rest yourself and your horse.--Here!  Hi!  Jack!\"    The Kaffir came from under the wagon, grinning.    \"Drive your bullocks carefully, and bring them back in good condition.\"    The man smiled and showed his teeth.    \"That's right.  Go along and have your sleep.\"    The Kaffir went back and crept under the wagon, and Emson clasped his  brother's hand.    \"Take your time, but don't lose any, old fellow,\" he said; \"for I shall  be glad to see you back.  Take care of yourself.  I wish I were going  with you, but I can't.  There, you are man enough to manage everything,  so good-bye.\"    He urged his horse forward and went back swiftly along the trail, his  nag cantering steadily along one of the broad ruts made by the wagon  wheels in the sand, while Dyke went and seated himself just under the  wagon-tilt, and watched him till he was out of view.    \"Six days and nights at the least,\" said Dyke to himself with a sigh,  \"and perhaps a fortnight, before I get back.  Never mind; every day will  be one less, and I don't suppose I shall mind its being lonely, after  all.  Duke's good company, and so is Breezy, without counting Jack, and  it isn't so very bad after all to go riding through the country with  one's own tent on wheels.  Why, some fellows at home would be mad with  joy to get such a chance.  Ah, look at that.  Why, if I'd been ready, I  might have got a couple of Guinea-fowl for the larder.\"    For a flock of the curious speckled birds came and settled amongst the  bushes on the other side of the water pool, but catching sight of  visitors, went off with a tremendous outcry.    \"Don't matter,\" said Dyke; \"there's plenty of the buck.\"    The sun was sinking low in the west, as after a long, toilsome journey  from the last water, Dyke, with the great whip held aloft like a large  fishing-rod and line, sat on the wagon-box shouting to the weary oxen  from time to time.  He was apparently quite alone, save that Breezy was  tethered by a long leathern rein to the back of the wagon.  There was no  Kaffir Jack, no Duke; and the boy, as he sat driving, looked weary, worn  out, and disconsolate.    For days past he had been upon a faintly-marked track leading  south-west--a track in which hoof-marks and the traces of wagon wheels  having passed that way were faintly to be seen, quite sufficient to show  him that he was on the right track for civilisation in some form, and he  felt pretty certain that sooner or later he would reach Oom  Morgenstern's store and farm.    But it had been a terrible task that managing of the team alone, and  urging the sluggish animals to drag the wagon when they reached heavy  patches of sand.  Then, too, there was the outspanning--the unyoking the  often vicious animals from the dissel-boom or wagon pole and trek chain,  when he halted by water, and let them drink and feed.  Then the  inspanning, the yoking up of the oxen again, and the start once more.    That huge whip, too, had been such a clumsy thing to handle, but highly  necessary, for without it he would never have reached the end of his"]]]
