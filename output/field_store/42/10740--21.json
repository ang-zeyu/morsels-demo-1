Far be it from me to blacken the reputation of any bird, but there is at  least circumstantial evidence that the long-crested jay, like his  eastern cousin, is a nest robber; for such birds as robins, tanagers,  flycatchers, and vireos make war upon him whenever he comes within their  breeding districts, and this would indicate that they are only too well  aware of his predatory habits. More than that, he has the sly and  stealthy manners of the sneak-thief and the brigand. Of course, he is by  no means an unmixed evil, for you will often see him leaping about on  the lawns, capturing beetles and worms which would surely be injurious  to vegetation if allowed to live and multiply.    There are other jays in the Rockies that deserve attention. The Rocky  Mountain jay--_Perisoneus canadensis capitalis_--is a bird of the higher  altitudes, remaining near the timber-line all the year round, braving  the most rigorous weather and the fiercest mountain storms during the  winter. Although not an attractive species, his hardiness invests him  with not a little interest. One can imagine him seeking a covert in the  dense pineries when a storm sweeps down from the bald, snow-mantled  summits, squawking his disapproval of the ferocity of old Boreas, and  yet able to resist his most violent onsets.    [Illustration: _The Rocky Mountain Jay_    \"_Seeking a covert in the dense pineries when a storm sweeps down from  the mountains_\"]    Early in April, at an altitude of from eight thousand to eleven thousand  five hundred feet, these jays begin to breed. At that height this is  long before the snow ceases to fall; indeed, on the twentieth of June,  while making the descent from Pike's Peak, I was caught in a snowfall  that gave the ground quite a frosty aspect for a few minutes. One can  readily fancy, therefore, that the nests of these birds are often  surrounded with snow, and that the bantlings may get their first view  of the world in the swirl of a snow-squall. The nests are built in pine  bushes and trees at various distances from the ground. Of all the  hurly-burlies ever heard, that which these birds are able to make when  you go near their nests, or discover them, bears off the palm, their  voices being as raucous as a buzz-saw, fairly setting your teeth on  edge.    Those of us who live in the East are so accustomed to the adjective  \"blue\" in connection with the jay that we are surprised to find that _P.  c. capitalis_ wears no blue whatever, but dons a sombre suit of leaden  gray, somewhat relieved by the blackish shade of the wings and tail,  with their silvery or frosted lustre. He is certainly not an attractive  bird, either in dress or in form, for he appears very \"thick-headed\" and  lumpish, as if he scarcely knew enough to seek shelter in a time of  storm; but, of course, a bird that contrives to coax a livelihood out of  such unpromising surroundings must possess a fine degree of  intelligence, and, therefore, cannot be so much of a dullard as his  appearance would indicate.    He has some interesting ways, too, as will be seen from the following  quotation from a Colorado writer: \"White-headed, grave, and sedate, he  seems a very paragon of propriety, and if you appear to be a suitable  personage, he will be apt to give you a bit of advice. Becoming  confidential, he sputters out a lot of nonsense which causes you to  think him a veritable 'whiskey Jack.' Yet, whenever he is disposed, a  more bland, mind-your-own-business appearing bird will be hard to find;  as will also many small articles around camp after one of his visits,  for his whimsical brain has a great fancy for anything which may be  valuable to you, but perfectly useless to himself.\" This habit of  purloining has won him the title of \"camp robber\" among the people of  the Rocky Mountains.    Woodhouse's jay, also peculiar to the Rocky Mountain region, is mostly  to be found along the base of the foothills and the lower wooded  mountains. While he may be called a \"blue\" jay, having more of that  color in his plumage than even the long-crested, he belongs to the  _Aphelcoma_ group--that is, he is without a crest.    Every observer of eastern feathered folk is familiar with our \"little  boy blue,\" the indigo-bird, whose song is such a rollicking and saucy  air, making you feel as if the little lyrist were chaffing you. In  Colorado, however, you do not meet this animated chunk of blue, but  another little bird that belongs to the same group, called the \"painted  finches,\" although their plumes are not painted any more than those of  other species. This bird is the lazuli bunting. He wears a great deal of  blue, but it is azure, and not indigo, covering the head, neck, most of  the upper parts, and the lining of the wings; and, as if to give  variety to the bird's attire, the nape and back are prettily shaded with  brown, and the wings and tail with black. But his plumage is still more  variegated, for he bears a conspicuous white spot on the greater  wing-coverts, and his breast is daintily tinted with chestnut-brown,  abruptly cut off from the blue of the throat, while the remaining under  parts are snowy white. From this description it will be seen that he is  quite unlike the indigo-bird, which has no brown or white in his  cerulean attire. Handsome as Master Indigo is, the lazuli finch, with  his sextet of hues, is a more showily dressed bird; in fact, a lyric in  colors.    The habits of the two birds are quite similar. However, the lazuli  seemed to be much shyer than his relative, for the latter is a familiar  figure at the border of our eastern woodlands, about our country homes,  and even in the neighborhood of our town dwellings, when there are  bushes and trees close at hand. My saunterings among the mountains took  me into the haunts of the lazulis, but I regret to have to confess that  all my alertness was of so little avail that I saw only three males and  one female. One day, while rambling among the cottonwoods that broidered  the creek flowing south of Colorado Springs, I was brought to a  standstill by a sharp chirp, and the next moment a pair of lazulis  appeared on the lower branches and twigs of a tree. There they sat quiet  enough, watching me keenly, but allowing me to peer at them at will  with my field-glass. I could not understand why birds that otherwise  were so shy should now permit a prolonged inspection and manifest so  little anxiety; but perhaps they reasoned that they had been discovered  anyway, and there was no need of pretending that no lazulis dwelt in the  neighborhood. How elegant the little husband looked in his variegated  attire! The wife was soberly clad in warm brown, slightly streaked with  dusk, but she was trig and pretty and worthy of her more richly  apparelled spouse. In the bushes below I found a well-made nest, which I  felt morally certain belonged to the little couple that was keeping such  faithful surveillance over it. As yet it contained no eggs.    In order to make certainty doubly sure, I visited the place a week or so  later, and found that my previous conclusion had been correct. I flushed  the little madame from the nest, and saw her flit with a chirp to the  twigs above, where she sat quietly watching her visitor, exhibiting no  uneasiness whatever about her cot in the bushes with its three precious  eggs. It was pleasing to note the calmness and dignity with which she  regarded me. But where was that important personage, the little husband?  He was nowhere to be seen, although I lingered about the charmed spot  for over two hours, hoping to get at least a glimpse of him. A friend,  who understands the sly ways of the lazulis, suggested that very likely  the male was watching me narrowly all the while from a safe hiding-place  in the dense foliage of some tree not far away.    My friend told me that I would not be able to distinguish the song of  the lazuli from those of the summer and mountain warblers. We shall see  whether he was right. One evening I was searching for a couple of blue  grosbeaks at the border of Colorado Springs, where I had previously seen  them, when a loud, somewhat percussive song, much like the summer  warbler's, burst on my ear, coming from a clump of willow bushes hard by  the stream. At once I said to myself, \"That is not the summer warbler's  trill. It resembles the challenging song of the indigo-bird, only it is  not quite so loud and defiant. A lazuli finch's song, or I am sadly  astray! Let me settle the question now.\"    I did settle it to my great satisfaction, for, after no little effort, I  succeeded in obtaining a plain view of the elusive little lyrist, and,  sure enough, it proved to be the lazuli finch. Metaphorically I patted  myself with a great deal of self-complacency, as I muttered: \"The idea  of Mr. Aiken's thinking I had so little discrimination! I know that  hereafter I shall be able to detect the lazuli's peculiar intonations  every time.\" So I walked home in a very self-confident frame of mind. A  few days later I heard another song lilting down from the upper branches  of a small tree. \"Surely that is the lazuli again,\" I muttered. \"I know  that voice.\" For a while I eyed the tree, and presently caught sight of  the little triller, and behold, it was--a summer warbler! All my  self-complacency vanished in a moment; I wasn't cock-sure of anything;  and I am obliged to confess that I was led astray in a similar manner  more than once afterward. It may indicate an odd psychological condition  to make the claim; but, absurd or not, I am disposed to believe that,  whenever I really heard the lazuli, I was able to recognize his song  with a fair degree of certainty, but when I heard the summer warbler I  was thrown into"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25992"],[0,"The Martyrs of Science, or, The lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (#17)"],[1," said to have originated in a difference of opinion  respecting their mathematical acquirements, terminated here; and Tycho  repaired his loss by cementing upon his face a nose of gold and silver,  which is said to have formed a good imitation of the original.    During the years 1567 and 1568, Tycho continued to reside at Rostoch,  with the exception of a few months, during which he made a rapid journey  into Denmark. He lived in a house in the college of the Jesuits, which  he had rented on account of its fitness for celestial observations; but,  though he intended to spend the winter under its roof, he had made no  arrangement respecting his future life, leaving it, as he said, in the  hands of Providence. A desire, however, to visit the south of Germany  induced him to quit Rostoch, and having crossed the Danube, he paid a  visit to Augsburg.    Upon entering this ancient city, Tycho was particularly struck with the  grandeur of its fortifications, the splendour of its private houses, and  the beauty of its fountains; and, after a short residence within its  walls, he was still more delighted with the industry of the people, the  refinement of the higher classes, and the love of literature and science  which was cherished by its wealthy citizens. Among the interesting  acquaintances which he formed at Augsburg, were two brothers, John and  Paul Hainzel, the one a septemvir, and the other the consul or  burgomaster. They were both distinguished by their learning, and both of  them, particularly Paul, were ardent lovers of astronomy. Tycho had  hitherto no other astronomical instrument than the coarse radius which  was made for him by Scultetus, and he waited only for a proper occasion  to have a larger and better instrument constructed for his use. Having  now the command of workmen who could execute his plans, he conceived the  bold design of making a divided instrument which should distinctly  exhibit single minutes of a degree. While he was transferring the first  rude conception of his instrument to paper, Paul Hainzel entered his  study, and was so struck with the grandeur of the plan, that he  instantly undertook to have it executed at his own expense. The  projected instrument was a quadrant of fourteen cubits radius! and Tycho  and his friend entered upon its construction with that intense ardour  which is ever crowned with success.    In the village of Gegginga, about half a mile to the south of the city,  Paul Hainzel had a country house, the garden of which was chosen as the  spot where the quadrant was to be fixed. The best artists in Augsburg,  clockmakers, jewellers, smiths, and carpenters, were engaged to execute  the work, and from the zeal which so novel an instrument inspired, the  quadrant was completed in less than a month. Its size was so great that  twenty men could with difficulty transport it to its place of fixture.  The two principal rectangular radii were beams of oak; the arch which  lay between their extremities was made of solid wood of a particular  kind, and the whole was bound together by twelve beams. It received  additional strength from several iron bands, and the arch was covered  with plates of brass, for the purpose of receiving the 5400 divisions  into which it was to be subdivided. A large and strong pillar of oak,  shod with iron, was driven into the ground, and kept in its place by  solid mason work. To this pillar the quadrant was fixed in a vertical  plane, and steps were prepared to elevate the observer, when stars of a  low altitude required his attention. As the instrument could not be  conveniently covered with a roof, it was protected from the weather by a  covering made of skins, but notwithstanding this and other precautions,  it was broken to pieces by a violent storm, after having remained  uninjured for the space of five years.    As this quadrant was fitted only to determine the altitudes of the  celestial bodies, Tycho constructed a large sextant for the purpose of  measuring their distances. It consisted of two radii, which opened and  shut round a centre, and which were nearly four cubits long, and also of  two arches, one of which was graduated, while the other served to keep  the radii in the same plane. After the radii had been opened or shut  till they nearly comprehended the angle between the stars to be  observed, the adjustment was completed by means of a very fine tangent  screw. With this instrument Tycho made many excellent observations  during his stay at Augsburg. He began also the construction of a wooden  globe about six feet in diameter. Its outer surface was turned with  great accuracy into a sphere, and kept from warping by interior bars of  wood supported at its centre.    After receiving a visit from the celebrated Peter Ramus, who  subsequently fell a victim at the massacre of St Bartholomew, Tycho left  Augsburg, having received a promise from his friend Hainzel that he  would communicate to him the observations made with his large quadrant,  and with the sextant which he had given him in a present. He paid a  visit to Philip Appian in passing through Ingolstadt, and returned to  his native country about the end of 1571.    The fame which he had acquired as an astronomer procured for him a  warmer reception than that which he had formerly experienced. The King  invited him to court, and his friends and admirers loaded him with  kindness. His uncle, Steno Bille, who now lived at the ancient convent  of Herritzvold, and who had always taken a deep interest in the  scientific character of his nephew, not only invited him to his house,  but assigned to him for an observatory the part of it which was best  adapted for that purpose. Tycho cheerfully accepted of this liberal  offer. The immediate proximity of Herritzvold to Knudstorp, rendered  this arrangement peculiarly convenient, and in the house of his uncle he  experienced all that kindness and consideration which natural affection  and a love of science combined to cherish. When Steno learned that the  study of chemistry was one of the pursuits of his nephew, he granted him  a spacious house, a few yards distant from the convent, for his  laboratory. Tycho lost no time in fitting up his observatory, and in  providing his furnaces; and regarding gold and silver and the other  metals as the stars of the earth, he used to represent his two opposite  pursuits as forming only one science, namely, celestial and terrestrial  astronomy.    In the hopes of enriching himself by the pursuits of alchemy, Tycho  devoted most of his attention to those satellites of gold and silver  which now constituted his own system, and which disturbed by their  powerful action the hitherto uniform movements of their primary. His  affections were ever turning to Germany, where astronomers of kindred  views, and artists of surpassing talent were to be found in almost every  city. The want of money alone prevented him from realizing his wishes;  and it was in the hope of attaining the means of travelling, that he in  a great measure forsook his sextants for his crucibles. In order,  however, that he might have one good instrument in his observatory, he  constructed a sextant similar to, but somewhat larger than, that which  he had presented to Hainzel. Its limb was made of solid brass, and was  exquisitely divided into single minutes of a degree. Its radii were  strengthened with plates of brass, and the apparatus for opening and  shutting them was made with great accuracy.    The possession of this instrument was peculiarly fortunate for Tycho,  for an event now occurred which roused him from his golden visions, and  directed all his faculties into their earlier and purer current. On the  11th November 1572, when he was returning to supper from his laboratory,  the clearness of the sky inspired him with the desire of completing some  particular observations. On looking up to the starry firmament he was  surprised to see an extraordinary light in the constellation of  Cassiopeia, which was then above his head. He felt confident that he had  never before observed such a star in that constellation, and  distrusting the evidence of his own senses, he called out the servants  and the peasants, and having received their testimony that it was a huge  star such as they had never seen before, he was satisfied of the  correctness of his own vision. Regarding it as a new and unusual  phenomenon, he hastened to his observatory, adjusted his sextant, and  measured its distances from the nearest stars in Cassiopeia. He noted  also its form, its magnitude, its light, and its colour, and he waited  with great anxiety for the next night that he might determine the  important point whether it was a fixed star, or a body within, or near  to, our own system.    For several years Tycho had been in the practice of calculating, at the  beginning of each year, a sort of almanac for his own use, and in this  he inserted all the observations which he had made on the new star, and  the conclusions which he had drawn from them. Having gone to Copenhagen  in the course of the ensuing spring, he shewed this manuscript to John  Pratensis, a Professor, in whose house he was always hospitably  received. Charles Danzeus, the French ambassador, and a person of great  learning, having heard of Tycho's arrival, invited himself to dine with  him at the house of Pratensis. The conversation soon turned upon the new  star, and Tycho found his companion very sceptical about its existence.  Danzeus was particularly jocular on the subject, and attacked the Danes  for their inattention to so important a science as astronomy. Tycho  received this lecture in good temper, and with the anxious expectation  that a clear sky would enable him to give a practical refutation of the  attack which was made upon his country. The night turned out serene, and  the whole party saw with astonishment the new star under the most  favourable circumstances. Pratensis"]]]
