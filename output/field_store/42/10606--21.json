I had but to close my eyes and the  scene of deluge and destruction, there beneath the Snake, came as a  vivid picture before them and the eyes and voice of the woman that had  bade me forget were with me always. Those burning eyes! They blotted  out every other vision even that of the woman that had waited. God help  me, I could not even remember the semblance of her face always those  eyes of flame came between us. And God help her! If she had waited all  these years she would be an old, old woman but forty years! Surely she  was dead!    When had it been, that awful sleep of mine that had blotted out nearly  half a century, and left me, an anachronism, an outcast a \"young,  strong man\" still, whilst my schoolmates must be old, toothless gossips  or long since dead and forgotten? It must have been in the crater where  I had fallen that all these years had passed!    The strange berries, mayhap they had robbed me of these years the  berries that stupefied me and gave me pleasant dreams.    What then had the priestess bidden me forget . . . the path? Yes, the  path; and truly my wanderings had been but as a confused dream, a long  weary search it had seemed, hopeless and endless, yet it could have  taken but a few months from that long total of years.    And the thought came to me that though I knew nothing of this way of my  return, yet the spell had not been perfect, for I forgot little of that  other path I had trod with Inyati, and after; and I could, and would,  return!    For as my strength came back, and grew till it was the wonder of all,  so did my longing to return increase.    The eyes the voice that had bidden me go, now seemed to call for me  incessantly . . . all else was a weariness I must go back!    For long I fought it. I even went back to England with Gerard, my good  friend the Consul, who, if he still thought me mad, at least respected  my madness.    For he said nothing of my story to a soul, and he it was that piloted  me as a child through the new conditions of life that I found on all  sides in England; he helped me turn part of my diamonds into a large  fortune, he helped me at length and with reluctance, for he would  rather not have believed in the miracle of my long sleep to find proof  of all I had told him.    There came a day when we stood before the graves of my father and  mother, who had died years after I had left England died mourning me as  dead and from the lips of an old greybeard, who had been my schoolmate,  we heard how that scapegrace son of theirs had gone treasure-seeking  and had never returned all those years ago.    Poor old garrulous fool; he little knew that the deformed, but strong  and vigorous man that asked him of this companion of his youth was that  very \"scapegrace\" himself transformed, and with age held back from him  by a miracle.    And there came a day, too, when a sweet-voiced, silver-haired old lady,  with her grandchildren playing about her, told these two strangers from  Africa how her lover of long ago had gone there to win her a fortune,  and had never returned, and how she had waited ten long years for him,  till all hope of him had fled, before she married; and how even now she  held his memory in dear regard.    How astonished and delighted she had been at the blazing diamond I had  given her, in memory of that old adventurer, of whom we said we had  heard in far-off Africa; and how I feared as she looked in my eyes,  that she would know. For as she gazed tearfully at me, and stammered  her protests and thanks for she was poor, and it meant wealth to her I  saw her eyes widen as they looked into my own, and she stammered: \"You!  . . . who are you? . . . You have his very eyes, are you his son?\"    Almost was I tempted to tell her all, but the Consul's warning glance  stayed me; and why, indeed, should I change her sweet memory of me as I  had been, into the horror and dismay she must feel if she knew all?    And so I left her happy, and she blessed me as I went; blessed me as a  mother might do for indeed I was apparently young enough to be her son  and to her amongst all the women of my own land my disfigurements were  as nothing, for she was of those wise and sweet beings that see deeper  than the surface.    And then I came back, for I was as a lost man there in the rush and  worry of a civilization I knew nothing of moreover, never could I rest,  for the eyes of that other being were haunting me and calling me . . .  calling me. . . . Well she had known spirit, woman, witch, or what she  may have been that once I had looked in her eyes I might forget all  else, but her I should forget never.    And so I have sought for years . . . and I cannot find the path.    Again and again I have tried from all sides. West, where Inyati led me,  the dunes have altered; storm after storm has swept them till many of  the pans are filled and covered, and others laid bare; and from the  south it is the same.    Eastward I have tried in vain, for Khama's men are jealous guardians of  the desert border there, and twice I have been turned back, in spite of  my gold.    From the north and through it I must have found a path back I have  struggled long, and there fever has killed my men, and pathless forests  have kept me back.    There I left Gerard in a lonely grave; for after he knew that my story  had been true nothing could keep him from joining me. Life in Loanda  was far too tame, with such an adventure in hand. \"Hang the diamonds,\"  he had said, \"I've money enough for my simple needs. But those berries  they are what I want, for I am getting old, and would be young again.  And this woman you dream and rave of perhaps I would see her too!\"    Poor friend, he lies there in the thick forest where the fever took him  he had not my strength.    And now I go again this time alone. I have searched these dunes till  but one path remains untried on that path I now travel. And this time I  shall not strive in vain, and again I shall look into those eyes that I  have worshipped so long.    And then? Who knows? I am no trembling fugitive now, but one who fears  not to measure strength with the immortals if needs be. ... If she be  that, I fear nothing . . . and I shall find the way. Seek not to follow  me, my friend of the wilderness . . . for I leave no spoor. . . . This  time I shall find the path.    It was nearly morning when he finished his weird tale; the waning moon  had risen, and threw a faint light over the limitless void of the  desert.    The fire was dying down, and I turned to replenish it; for lions were  numerous in the vicinity. And as I turned back, I saw this strange  acquaintance of mine for the last time. He stood about twenty yards  away, his arms outstretched towards the desert as though in  supplication; a motionless and striking figure in spite of his  deformity.    \"I'm going to turn in,\" I called; but he neither moved nor answered,  and when I looked again he had gone.    \"He will be back directly,\" I thought, and curling myself up on my  blanket I fell asleep immediately.    All too soon my boys called me, and waking, I found that my guest had  gone.    \"Which way?\" I asked Jantje.    \"Nie, baas; ek wiet nie,\" he said, shaking his head.    \"Kambala,\" said I, impatiently, to the other man; \"has the ou baas  gone?\"    \"Ee-wah t In-koos,\" he answered in the affirmative; \"but where I know  not. Ask thou, master, these Bushmen, they know!\"    There were two Bushmen in the camp, who had turned up but the day  before and I made Kambala bring the small, pot-bellied men to where I  sat. I knew their \"talk.\"    \"The baas with the scarred face,\" I said; \"whither went he?\"    \"No! no!\" they answered in their clicking tongue, \"we know not! Who  knows? Not we 'Khoi Khoian.'\"    \"Ye are no 'Khoi Khoian' (Hottentots, as Bushmen often like to style  themselves), but San (Bushmen), and of these parts. Therefore, answer  me where is he, that scarred one?\"    They squatted on their haunches before me, looking at me furtively from  their little slits of eyes, muttering to each other afraid.    \"Master, we fear,\" they said reluctantly. \"He is a great witch, that  'old one' we know him well. Often does he cross the dunes where even we  dare not go where no man goes!\"    \"Seek him,\" I ordered.    \"No! no!\" they said again, \"he leaves no spoor and we fear. It is not  well to follow that 'old one'!\"    And search as I could, no spoor did I find.    But what I did find, there on my blanket beside my pillow, was a big,  blue, uncut diamond, together with a scrap of paper bearing the one  word \"Farewell.\"        THE SALTING OF THE GREAT NORTH-EASTERN FIELDS        THE SALTING OF THE GREAT NORTH-EASTERN FIELDS        CHAPTER I        To be \"broke to the world\" was by no means a new experience to Dick  Sydney, and as he sat on the sandy shore near Luderitzbucht and watched  the setting sun turn the broad ocean into molten gold, he was little  troubled by the fact that his last mark had been spent an hour or two  back for a very belated and necessary breakfast, and that he was now  absolutely penniless. Always an optimist, Dick easily outdid the  immortal Micawber in his faith in something turning up just when things  looked their blackest, and he had literally no thought for the morrow,  until his hand, mechanically groping in his pocket for the wherewithal  to fill his pipe, advised him of the fact that even his \"baccy\" was  finished.    This was serious, for Dick's old battered briar rarely left his mouth;  and whilst the odoriferous Boer equivalent for the \"divine weed\" held  out, food and drink were but minor considerations. But something must  be done now, so, knocking out the ashes from his last whiff, and with  one more futile grope in his capacious pocket, he stuck his empty pipe  in his mouth, rose, stretched himself, and,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21900"],[0,"The Principles of Breeding (#17)"],[1," can be disposed of with greatest profit, and these things will at once  point to him the breed he should be solicitous to obtain. The man of  wealth and patriotism may have more extensive views, and nobly look to  the general improvement of cattle; but the farmer, with his limited  means and with the claims that press upon him, regards his cattle as a  valuable portion of his own little property, and on which every thing  should appear to be in natural keeping, and be turned to the best  advantage. The best beast for him is that which suits his farm the  best, and with a view to this, he studies, or ought to study, the  points and qualities of his own cattle, and those of others. The  dairyman will regard the quantity of milk--the quality--its value for  the production of butter and cheese--the time that the cow continues  in milk--the character of the breed for quietness, or as being good  nurses--the predisposition to garget or other disease, or dropping  after calving--the natural tendency to turn every thing to  nutriment--the ease with which she is fattened when given up as a  milker, and the proportion of food requisite to keep her in full milk  or to fatten her when dry. The grazier will consider the kind of beast  which his land will bear--the kind of meat most in demand in his  neighborhood--the early maturity--the quickness of fattening at any  age--the quality of the meat--the parts on which the flesh and fat are  principally laid--and more than all the hardihood and the adaptation  to the climate and soil.    In order to obtain these valuable properties the good farmer will make  himself perfectly master of the characters and qualities of his own  stock. He will trace the connection of certain good qualities and  certain bad ones, with an almost invariable peculiarity of shape and  structure; and at length he will arrive at a clear conception, not so  much of beauty of form (although that is a pleasing object to  contemplate) as of that outline and proportion of parts with which  _utility_ is oftenest combined. Then carefully viewing his stock he  will consider where they approach to, and how far they wander from,  this utility of form; and he will be anxious to preserve or to  increase the one and to supply the deficiency of the other. He will  endeavor to select from his own stock those animals that excel in the  most valuable points, and particularly those which possess the  greatest number of these points, and he will unhesitatingly condemn  every beast that manifests deficiency in any one important point. He  will not, however, too long confine himself to his own stock, unless  it be a very numerous one. The breeding from close affinities has many  advantages to a certain extent. It was the source whence sprung the  cattle and sheep of Bakewell and the superior cattle of Colling; and  to it must also be traced the speedy degeneracy, the absolute  disappearance of the New Leicester cattle, and, in the hands of many  agriculturists, the impairment of constitution and decreased value of  the New Leicester sheep and of the Short-horns. He will therefore seek  some change in his stock every second or third year, and that change  is most conveniently effected by introducing a new bull. This bull  should be of the same breed, and pure, coming from a similar pasturage  and climate, but possessing no relationship--or, at most, a very  distant one--to the stock to which he is introduced. He should bring  with him every good point which the breeder has labored to produce in  his stock, and if possible, some improvement, and especially in the  points where the old stock may have been somewhat deficient, and most  certainly he should have no manifest defect of form; and that most  essential of all qualifications, a hardy constitution, should not be  wanting.    There is one circumstance, however, which the breeder occasionally  forgets, but which is of as much importance to the permanent value of  his stock as any careful selection of animals can be--and that is,  good keeping. It has been well said that all good stock must be both  bred with attention and well fed. It is necessary that these two  essentials in this species of improvement should always accompany each  other; for without good resources of keeping, it would be vain to  attempt supporting a valuable stock. This is true with regard to the  original stock. It is yet more evident when animals are absurdly  brought from a better to a poorer soil. The original stock will  deteriorate if neglected and half-starved, and the improved breed will  lose ground even more rapidly, and to a far greater extent.\"    A very brief resume of the preceding remarks may be expressed as  follows:    The Law of Similarity teaches us to select animals for breeding which  possess the desired forms and qualities in the greatest perfection and  best combination.    Regard should be had not only to the more obvious characteristics, but  also to such hereditary traits and tendencies as may be hidden from  cursory observation and demand careful and thorough investigation.    From the hereditary nature of all characteristics, whether good or  bad, we learn the importance of having all desirable qualities and  properties _thoroughly inbred_; or, in other words, so firmly fixed in  each generation, that the next is warrantably certain to present  nothing worse,--that no ill results follow from breeding back towards  some inferior ancestor,--that all undesirable traits or points be, so  far as possible, _bred out_.    So important is this consideration, that in practice, it is decidedly  preferable to employ a male of ordinary external appearance, provided  his ancestry be all which is desired, rather than a grade or  cross-bred animal, although the latter be greatly his superior in  personal beauty.    A knowledge of the Law of Divergence teaches us to avoid, for breeding  purposes, such animals as exhibit variations unfavorable to the  purpose in view; and to endeavor to perpetuate every real improvement  gained; also to secure as far as practicable, the conditions  necessary to induce or to perpetuate any improvement, such as general  treatment, food, climate, habit, &c.    Where the parents do not possess the perfection desired, selections  for coupling should be made with critical reference to correcting the  faults or deficiencies of one by corresponding excellence in the  other.    But to correct defects too much must not be attempted at once. Pairing  those very unlike, oftener results in loss than in gain. Mating a  horse for speed with a draft mare, will more likely beget progeny good  for neither, than for both. Avoid all extremes, and endeavor by  moderate degrees to obtain the object desired.    Crossing, between different breeds, for the purpose of obtaining  animals for the shambles, may be advantageously practiced to  considerable extent, but not for the production of breeding animals.  As a general rule cross-bred males should not be employed for  propagation, and cross-bred females should be served by thorough-bred  males.    In ordinary practice, breeding from near relationships is to be  _scrupulously avoided_; for certain purposes, under certain conditions  and circumstances, and in the hands of a skillful breeder, it may be  practiced with advantage, but not otherwise.    In a large majority of cases (other things being equal) we may expect  in progeny the outward form and general structure of the sire,  together with the internal qualities, constitution and nutritive  system of the dam; each, however, modified by the other.    Particular care should always be taken that the male by which the dam  first becomes pregnant is the best which can be obtained; also, that  at the time of sexual congress both are in vigorous health.    Breeding animals should not be allowed to become fat, but always kept  in thrifty condition; and such as are intended for the butcher should  never be fat but once.    In deciding with what breeds to stock a farm, endeavor to select those  best adapted to its surface, climate, and degree of fertility; also  with reference to probable demand and proximity to markets.    No expense incurred in procuring choice animals for propagation, or  any amount of skill in breeding, can supersede, or compensate for, a  lack of liberal feeding and good treatment. The better the stock, the  better care they deserve.          CHAPTER X.    CHARACTERISTICS OF VARIOUS BREEDS.      The inquiry is frequently made, what is the best breed of cattle,  sheep, &c., for general use. In reply it may be said that no breed can  by any possibility fulfill all requirements in the best possible  manner; one is better for meat and early maturity, another for milk,  another for wool, and so on. Because under certain circumstances it  may be necessary or advisable for a man to serve as his own builder,  tailor, tanner and blacksmith, it by no means follows that all which  is required will be as well, or as easily done, as by a division of  labor. So it is better for many reasons, and more profit can be made,  by employing different breeds for different purposes, than by using  one for all, and towards such profitable employment we should  constantly aim. At the same time there is a large class of farmers so  situated that they cannot keep distinct breeds, and yet wish to employ  them for different uses, and whose requirements will best be met by a  kind of cattle, which, without possessing remarkable excellence in any  one direction, shall be sufficiently hardy, the oxen proving docile  and efficient laborers for a while, and then turn quickly into good  beef upon such food as their farms will produce, the cows giving a  fair quantity and quality of milk for the needs of the family and  perhaps to furnish a little butter and cheese for market.    Before proceeding to answer the inquiry more definitely, it may be  well to remark further, that among the facts of"]]]
