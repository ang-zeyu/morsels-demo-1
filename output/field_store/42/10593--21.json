A maid had laid out her night things on a big settee (a little to  Lydia's surprise) and she undressed quickly.    She opened the door of her bedroom, her hand was on a switch, when she  was conscious of a faint and not unpleasant odour. It was a clean,  pungent smell. \"Disinfectant,\" said her brain mechanically. She turned  on the light, wondering where it came from. And then as she crossed the  room she came in sight of her bed and stopped, for it was saturated with  water--water that dropped from the hanging coverlet, and made little  pools on the floor. From the head of the bed to the foot there was not  one dry place. Whosoever had done the work was thorough. Blankets,  sheets, pillows were soddened, and from the soaked mass came a faint  acrid aroma which she recognised, even before she saw on the floor an  empty bottle labelled \"Peroxide of Hydrogen.\"    She could only stand and stare. It was too late to arouse the household,  and she remembered that there was a very comfortable settee in the  dressing-room with a rug and a pillow, and she went back.    A few minutes later she was fast asleep. Not so Miss Briggerland, who  was sitting up in bed, a cigarette between her lips, a heavy volume on  her knees, reading:    \"Such malignant cases are almost without exception rapidly fatal,  sometimes so early that no sign of the characteristic symptoms appear at  all,\" she read and, dropping the book on the floor, extinguished her  cigarette on an alabaster tray, and settled herself to sleep. She was  dozing when she remembered that she had forgotten to say her prayers.    \"Oh, damn!\" said Jean, getting out reluctantly to kneel on the cold  floor by the side of the bed.          Chapter XIX      Her maid woke Jean Briggerland at eight o'clock the next morning.    \"Oh, miss,\" she said, as she drew up the table for the chocolate, \"have  you heard about Mrs. Meredith?\"    Jean blinked open her eyes, slipped into her dressing jacket and sat up  with a yawn.    \"Have I heard about Mrs. Meredith? Many times,\" she said.    \"But what somebody did last night, miss?\"    Jean was wide awake now.    \"What has happened to Mrs. Meredith?\" she asked.    \"Why, miss, somebody played a practical joke on her. Her bed's sopping.\"    \"Sopping?\" frowned the girl.    \"Yes, miss,\" the woman nodded. \"They must have poured buckets of water  over it, and used up all Mrs. Cole-Mortimer's peroxide, what she uses  for keeping her hands nice.\"    Jean swung out of her bed and sat looking down at her tiny white feet.    \"Where did Mrs. Meredith sleep? Why didn't she wake us up?\"    \"She slept in the dressing-room, miss. I don't suppose the young lady  liked making a fuss.\"    \"Who did it?\"    \"I don't know who did it. It's a silly kind of practical joke, and I  know none of the maids would have dared, not the French ones.\"    Jean put her feet into her slippers, exchanged her jacket for a gown,  and went on a tour of inspection.    Lydia was dressing in her room, and the sound of her fresh, young voice,  as she carolled out of sheer love of life, came to the girl before she  turned into the room.    One glance at the bed was sufficient. It was still wet, and the empty  peroxide bottle told its own story.    Jean glanced at it thoughtfully as she crossed into the dressing-room.    \"Whatever happened last night, Lydia?\"    Lydia turned at the voice.    \"Oh, the bed you mean,\" she made a little face. \"Heaven knows. It  occurred to me this morning that some person, out of mistaken kindness,  had started to disinfect the room--it was only this morning that I  recalled the little boy who was ill--and had overdone it.\"    \"They've certainly overdone it,\" said Jean grimly. \"I wonder what poor  Mrs. Cole-Mortimer will say. You haven't the slightest idea----\"    \"Not the slightest idea,\" said Lydia, answering the unspoken question.    \"I'll see Mrs. Cole-Mortimer and get her to change your bed--there's  another room you could have,\" suggested Jean.    She went back to her own apartment, bathed and dressed leisurely.    She found her father in the garden reading the _Nicoise_, under the  shade of a bush, for the sun was not warm, but at that hour, blinding.    \"I've changed my plans,\" she said without preliminary.    He looked up over his glasses.    \"I didn't know you had any,\" he said with heavy humour.    \"I intended going back to London and taking you with me,\" she said  unexpectedly.    \"Back to London?\" he said incredulously. \"I thought you were staying on  for a month.\"    \"I probably shall now,\" she said, pulling up a basket-chair and sitting  by his side. \"Give me a cigarette.\"    \"You're smoking a lot lately,\" he said as he handed his case to her.    \"I know I am.\"    \"Have your nerves gone wrong?\"    She looked at him out of the corner of her eye and her lips curled.    \"It wouldn't be remarkable if I inherited a little of your yellow  streak,\" she said coolly, and he growled something under his breath.  \"No, my nerves are all right, but a cigarette helps me to think.\"    \"A yellow streak, have I?\" Mr. Briggerland was annoyed. \"And I've been  out since five o'clock this morning----\" he stopped.    \"Doing--what?\" she asked curiously.    \"Never mind,\" he said with a lofty gesture.    Thus they sat, busy with their own thoughts, for a quarter of an hour.    \"Jean.\"    \"Yes,\" she said without turning her head.    \"Don't you think we'd better give this up and get back to London? Lord  Stoker is pretty keen on you.\"    \"I'm not pretty keen on him,\" she said decidedly. \"He has his regimental  pay and L500 a year, two estates, mortgaged, no brains and a title--what  is the use of his title to me? As much use as a coat of paint! Beside  which, I am essentially democratic.\"    He chuckled, and there was another silence.    \"Do you think the lawyer is keen on the girl?\"    \"Jack Glover?\"    Mr. Briggerland nodded.    \"I imagine he is,\" said Jean thoughtfully. \"I like Jack--he's clever. He  has all the moral qualities which one admires so much in the abstract. I  could love Jack myself.\"    \"Could he love you?\" bantered her father.    \"He couldn't,\" she said shortly. \"Jack would be a happy man if he saw  me stand in Jim Meredith's place in the Old Bailey. No, I have no  illusion about Jack's affections.\"    \"He's after Lydia's money I suppose,\" said Mr. Briggerland, stroking his  bald head.    \"Don't be a fool,\" was the calm reply. \"That kind of man doesn't worry  about a girl's money. I wish Lydia was dead,\" she added without malice.  \"It would make things so easy and smooth.\"    Her father swallowed something.    \"You shock me sometimes, Jean,\" he said, a statement which amused her.    \"You're such a half-and-half man,\" she said with a note of contempt in  her voice. \"You were quite willing to benefit by Jim Meredith's death;  you killed him as cold-bloodedly as you killed poor little Bulford, and  yet you must whine and snivel whenever your deeds are put into plain  language. What does it matter if Lydia dies now or in fifty years time?\"  she asked. \"It would be different if she were immortal. You people  attach so much importance to human life--the ancients, and the Japanese  amongst the modern, are the only people who have the matter in true  perspective. It is no more cruel to kill a human being than it is to cut  the throat of a pig to provide you with bacon. There's hardly a dish at  your table which doesn't represent wilful murder, and yet you never  think of it, but because the man animal can talk and dresses himself or  herself in queer animal and vegetable fabrics, and decorates the body  with bits of metal and pieces of glittering quartz, you give its life a  value which you deny to the cattle within your gates! Killing is a  matter of expediency. Permissible if you call it war, terrible if you  call it murder. To me it is just killing. If you are caught in the act  of killing they kill you, and people say it is right to do so. The  sacredness of human life is a slogan invented by cowards who fear  death--as you do.\"    \"Don't you, Jean?\" he asked in a hushed voice.    \"I fear life without money,\" she said quietly. \"I fear long days of work  for a callous, leering employer, and strap-hanging in a crowded tube on  my way home to one miserable room and the cold mutton of yesterday. I  fear getting up and making my own bed and washing my own handkerchiefs  and blouses, and renovating last year's hats to make them look like this  year's. I fear a poor husband and a procession of children, and doing  the housework with an incompetent maid, or maybe without any at all.  Those are the things I fear, Mr. Briggerland.\"    She dusted the ash from her dress and got up.    \"I haven't forgotten the life we lived at Ealing,\" she said  significantly.    She looked across the bay to Monte Carlo glittering in the morning  sunlight, to the green-capped head of Cap-d'Ail, to Beaulieu, a jewel  set in greystone and shook her head.    \"'It is written',\" she quoted sombrely and left him in the midst of the  question he was asking. She strolled back to the house and joined Lydia  who was looking radiantly beautiful in a new dress of silver grey  charmeuse.          Chapter XX      \"Have you solved the mystery of the submerged bed?\" smiled Jean.    Lydia laughed.    \"I'm not probing too deeply into the matter,\" she said. \"Poor Mrs.  Cole-Mortimer was terribly upset.\"    \"She would be,\" said Jean. \"It was her own eiderdown!\"    This was the first hint Lydia had received that the house was rented  furnished.    They drove into Nice that morning, and Lydia, remembering Jack Glover's  remarks, looked closely at the chauffeur, and was startled to see a  resemblance between him and the man who had driven the taxicab on the  night she had been carried off from the theatre. It is true that the  taxi-driver had a moustache and that this man was clean-shaven, and  moreover, had tiny side whiskers, but there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21531"],[0,"Woodwork Joints: How They Are Set Out, How Made and Where Used. (#17)"],[1,"of regular joints simply because it has been partly dealt with in almost  every previous chapter. For example, we have mitre halving in Fig. 34, a  mitre bridle joint in Fig. 74, a tongued and grooved mitre in Fig. 116,  mitred mortise and tenon joints in Figs. 148 and 159, a dowelled mitre  frame in Fig. 202, and a mitred dovetail in Fig. 286.    [Illustration: Fig. 321.--Mitred Skirting.]    [Illustration: Fig. 322.--Curved Mitre.]    [Illustration: Fig. 323.--Halving the Angle.]    MITREING.--The term mitreing is generally used to denote the type of  joint used at the corner of a picture frame; or where two pieces of wood  are bevelled away so as to fit each other, as the skirting or plinth  mould at Fig. 321. In these cases the timber is cut so that the joint is  at 45 degrees to the face, and the two pieces, when placed together,  form an angle of 90 degrees (a right angle).    The term mitreing, however, is not confined to the fitting of timber  around a right angle; it may be justly applied to the fitting of a  moulding around an angle irrespective of the number of its degrees.    One often hears such terms as \"a half mitre,\" used to denote the fitting  of a moulding around an octagonal column or pedestal, and probably it  would be more correct to describe the joint as a mitre cut at 22-1/2  degrees. Mitreing consists of halving the angle and making each piece to  fit the line of bisection. Should the angle be bounded by straight lines,  as at Fig. 321, then the mitred joint will be a straight line, but should  the angle be bounded by a curved and a straight line, as at Fig. 322, A,  or by two curved lines, then the mitred joint will have to be a curved  line if the mouldings are to be of the same section.    [Illustration: Fig. 324.--Sawing Block for Mitreing.]    FINDING THE ANGLE.--For straight mitres, the mitre joint line is found by  bisecting the angle, as shown in the various examples, and the following  instructions are given to enable the reader to follow the diagram (Fig.  323). Take a pair of compasses, or dividers, and with any convenient  opening strike out the arc A, B. Put the point of the compasses on A, and  mark another arc C; then, without altering the distance between the  points of the compass, put the point on B, and mark the arc D. Draw the  line E from the corner, so that it cuts through the intersection made by  the arcs C and D. The angle A B is now halved by the line E, and this  method may be applied to any angle.    SAWING BLOCK.--For sawing mouldings, etc., to their approximate shape, a  home-made sawing block is generally used, as shown at Fig. 324. Two  pieces of wood are glued one on the top of the other, the required angle  is transferred thereto, and the saw kerf made. In the sketch the saw  kerfs are shown at 45 degrees, right and left, and other angles and kerfs  may be made where desired.    PLANING.--After sawing the piece to approximately the correct angle, it  is necessary on high-class work to plane the cut end so as to give a  perfect finish and enable a glued joint to be made. This may be  accomplished by using the plane on the shooting board, as shown at Fig.  325, and, if the worker is constantly using mitres of various angles, it  is an easy matter to make new angle blocks and fix them on to the board.  Other workers prefer the screw mitre trap shown at Fig. 326. This  apparatus takes wide plinth or cornice moulds, and the angle may be  altered by fitting temporary packing pieces under the work so as to tilt  the moulding to the desired angle. The method of using the plane is  indicated in the illustration.    Another method in everyday use by those workers who are constantly  mitreing wide pieces of stock at 45 degrees is the \"donkey's ear\"  shooting board illustrated at Fig. 327. The plane is laid on its side on  the surface of the board marked A, and used in a similar manner to that  shown at Fig. 325.    [Illustration: Fig. 325.--Use of Plane and Shooting Board for Mitreing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 326.--The Screw Mitre Trap.]    A simple method and one that should always be remembered because it is  handy when working without a shooting board is shown at Fig. 328. Set the  marking or cutting gauge to the thickness of the wood to be mitred at 45  degrees; then gauge this distance on the wood, as shown at B; draw from  the line to the edge, as shown, and saw and plane to a finish. The  diagonals of a square give 45 degrees, and this is the method used to  mark out the work. The end of the wood must, of course, be square with  its edges before marking out in this manner.    [Illustration: Fig. 327.--\"Donkey's Ear\" Shooting Board.]    [Illustration: Fig. 328.--Gauging for Mitres.]    [Illustration: Fig. 329.--Narrow Inner Moulding.]    [Illustration: Fig. 330.--Wide Mitred Moulding.]    Fig. 329 shows a bevelled framing into which has been mitred a narrow  moulding M so as to show a correct margin around the panel.    [Illustration: Fig. 331.--Door with Curved Mitres.]    [Illustration: Fig. 332.--Method of Setting out for a Curved Mitre.]    Fig. 330 shows a similar framing, but with a wide moulding M mitred  around it. To obtain a correct intersection of this moulding, the angles  A and B are bisected. The bisection of the angles meets before the width  of the moulding is cleared, therefore the angle C will again have to be  bisected, and the finished joint will appear as shown. One of the  simplest of mouldings with a large flat face has been chosen to  illustrate this. The moulding could be all in one width, as shown, or it  could be built into the framing in separate pieces, the wide flat and the  piece carrying the mould.    CURVED MITRES.--We now come to what are probably the most difficult of  all mitres, viz., curved mitres, and the writer well remembers in his  apprenticeship days his first experience of attempting to fit the  mouldings around the door shown at Fig. 331 by using straight mitres at  A. This, of course, is impossible if the mouldings are of the same  section and it is desired to make all the members correctly intersect. If  straight mitres are used the section of the curved moulding will have to  be of a different shape from the section of the straight moulding, and in  these days of machine-made mouldings this method is seldom resorted to.  It is better, cheaper, and easier to make curved mitres when the  necessary machinery is at hand.    TO SET OUT A CURVED MITRE (see Fig. 332).--Draw a section of the moulding  full size, A, as shown at the left hand of the illustration, and project  lines round the framing, as shown V, W, X, Y and Z. Where the lines V, W,  X, Y and Z intersect at the corner D, it clearly shows that a straight  mitre will not cut all the points of intersection. A curved line will cut  all the intersections, and a template made of cardboard, sheet zinc, or  veneer, should be made to this shape. At the left-hand side the  geometrical setting out is shown for obtaining the curve without having  to resort to drawing it freehand.    Take half the width of the moulding, as shown by dotted line A, and where  it cuts the approximation of the curved mitre place the point of the  compasses and strike out a circle as shown; with the same radius place  the compass point on B--that is, the inside point of the mitre, and cut  the circle on the right and left with the small arcs shown at _aa_. With  the same radius put the compass point at the junction of the circle and  mitre line, C V, and cut the circle at right and left, viz., _ee_.    [Illustration: Fig. 333.--Template for Mitreing.]    Now rule a line through _aa_, and another line through _ee_, and where  these lines cut each other it will give the correct radius of the curved  mitre. The advantage of knowing the correct radius of a curved mitre is  of great benefit to the skilled machinist, as it enables him to set up  his machine so as to give a definite result.    MITREING A MOULDED DOOR FRAME.--Fig. 333 illustrates the method of  mitreing the moulded portion of a door frame where the joint is dowelled,  not tenoned. A small wooden template is made out of beech or other  hardwood, having its ends cut at 45 degrees. This template is placed on  the rail, as shown, and held in position by placing both the rail and the  template in the vice. The face of the template forms a guide for a wide  chisel, and enables the worker to gradually pare away the moulding to the  correct angle.    [Illustration: Fig. 334.--Using Panel Saw in Mitre Box.]    For sawing the mitres on large mouldings such as are used on the lid of a  gramophone or wireless cabinet, a mitre sawing box and a panel saw may be  used as indicated at Fig. 334.          JOINTS FOR CURVED WORK      Fig. 335 shows a circular frame made up in two thicknesses, the segments  being screwed to each other and the joints crossed in two layers. This is  a very strong method, and it is used for making circular frames and curbs  up to 15 ft. in diameter. The segments can be either long or short, the  only important condition being that they must be marked out and sawn to  the correct radius. Fig. 337 shows a board marked out in segments for  this class of work. The longer the boards the better will they cut up, as  it gives more opportunities of cutting one piece out of the other as at A  A.    [Illustration: Fig. 335.--Circular Frame in Two Thicknesses.]    [Illustration: Fig. 336.--Circular Rim in Halved Segments.]    Fig. 338 shows how to begin to put the work together. To continue this,  fit other segments in position and screw them to D and E respectively.  The completed work is illustrated at Fig. 335.    [Illustration: Fig. 337.--Board Marked for Circular Jointing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 338.--Putting Circular Work Together.]    [Illustration: Fig. 339., Fig. 340.
