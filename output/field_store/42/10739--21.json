Yet such comprehension can only evince its true force when  animals shall have learnt how to give expression to that of which they  are aware. With reference to the incident which I have just cited, the  thought that presented itself to me first, was that the entire process  might possibly be no more than a matter of \"suggestion.\" Yet, on  probing further into the question, as well as by drawing comparisons,  the conclusions arrived at only further confirmed what I have above  stated. That this is so, will, I think, seem absolutely certain to  anyone who reads through the whole of this book carefully--indeed, they  will arrive at that conclusion without my labouring the question.    It was only by degrees that Lola became amenable to thought-transference,  and, in fact, this was only in accordance to the extent to which she  became mistress of the human tongue. Now this trait might have  degenerated into a serious failing, but, owing to the measures to which  I resorted so as to obviate any evil results, it has almost entirely  ceased. I now remain quite _passive_, while she is answering, trying to  suppress any \"thinking _with_ her,\" so that, when she tires, her own  individuality may not be disturbed.          ALTERATIONS AND MEMORY      As I have endeavoured to make clear--Lola was, especially during the  first month of tuition, exceedingly attentive at her lessons. Indeed,  her rapid progress can only be ascribed to this, and to her good  memory. Nor did she only evince this alertness at her studies, but  noticed everything that went on round about her, even to the following  of our conversations, her keenness was surprising. It is probable that  every lively and intelligent dog follows what is being said in its  presence, and notes our play of feature--this accounting for the  demonstrations of sympathy, and other symptoms of partisanship or of  aversion they so constantly show. In general, however, such intuitive  response is due rather to the dog's memory, and can only be brought to  the surface and recognized where the \"Spelling Method\" has become a  familiar mode of expression. Indeed, it may be said that its  attentiveness begins then to extend over a far greater field of  interest.    On the 19 April, 1916, several ladies--as yet unknown to Lola--were in  the room with me. She was sitting near the window and dividing her  attention between what was going on outside and in the room. After  about half an hour she did some sums and some spelling, acquiting  herself very well. For fun she was then asked the name of one of my  guests (N.B. the lady's name was really Fraeulein Herbster.) (Herbst =  autumn, so we usually call her Spring) \"What's the name of this girl?\"  I said: \"Fruehling\" ( = Spring) was her reply at once--so that she must  most obviously have been listening to us while we were talking.    On the 25 April of the same year, I went on a visit to Hohenheim,  taking Lola with me. While there I showed her a picture painted by  Ferdinand Leeke and said: \"That was done by 'Uncle' who came to stay  with us at the farm, at the time when Lola was allowed to go for her  first drive in the carriage with the two horses.\" (This event having  made a great impression on her.) \"Do you remember 'Uncle's' name?\" I  added. \"Yes!\" \"What is it?\" \"leke!\" The visit had taken place quite  three weeks ago.    On the 20 May I took Lola to tea at S----. She did her work there  excellently--both in viva voce arithmetic, as well as in the written  tests put to her, and also counted dots, etc. After this the  conversation became general, and Lola was not noticed. But in the  course of the afternoon I told my friends that I had been to  Hagenbeck's Circus a few days before, and that I had seen a monkey  dressed as a man, and that it had eaten most daintily, cycled, and done  other tricks. This had been a mere casual remark, and in about an  hour's time I had returned home with Lola. But that same evening, when  I was sitting reading, Lola came and rapped my hands--inquiring--\"wer  afe?\" ( = who monkey?) I was at the moment so absent minded that I did  not grasp what she was after--but she repeated \"afe!\" Then it suddenly  flashed into my mind--and I did my best to illustrate the performance  to her entire satisfaction. I gave an earlier conclusive proof of her  memory when I mentioned her recollection of the yard-stick after the  very brief explanation I had given her on the subject two months  previously. Spontaneous remarks have been allotted a special chapter in  this book, and may assist in proving what has already been stated, but  I should like here to add an example of how animals put a matter \"to  themselves,\" as it were, when the thing _heard_ has not been mentally  digested, so to speak--or may even be quite incomprehensible to them.    On 26 July, 1916, I said: \"Lola! now _you_ think of something to ask  _me_!\" \"Yes!\" \"Well, what is it to be?\" \"Yes, o h o.\" \"What is the  question? What am I to do with that word; the sentence is not complete,  is it?\" \"What means?\" \"You want to know what _oho_ means?\" \"Yes, yes!\"    If we but consider the manner in which a dog will listen--with ears  erect--to every word we say, the question Lola put to me will seem most  natural! It even \"comes naturally\" to her to use words which are \"above  her head,\" so to speak, as for instance, when she said \"surogat\"--and  in the case of Rolf, who referred to the \"Urseele!\" ( = the primeval  soul!) Words such as these are \"picked up\" by them much in the way that  children use words they do not know the meaning of: there may be  something in the sound that attracts them, but sometimes they make a  guess at the meaning, and in the case of animals, the guess is often a  very good one. In Lola this \"Art of Guessing\" almost led to a sort of  Romance!    In my Protocol of 14 December, I have the following entry: Yesterday I  asked Lola to tell me why dogs prefer being with human beings rather  than with other dogs--and I asked her the same question again to-day.  Lola answered: \"eid\" ( = oath). \"What is that? you were to answer me  to-day: say something properly!\" \"ich eid.\" \"Oh! I don't understand  this! tell me nicely!\" \"Eid fuer hunde.\" \"What is _oath_ to mean?\" \"Zu  schweigen!\" ( = to be silent) \"_What_? have you promised that to each  other?\" \"Yes.\" \"Who told you that?\" \"Frechi.\" (This was one of the dogs  on the farm.) \"Frechi? and what has that to do with you? Nonsense, had  you told me so yesterday I should have known now! Say 'we are happy'  otherwise I shall think you are telling me stories: now _why_?\" \"Wegen  iren augen und iren sorgen one ruhe\" ( = because of their eyes and  their sorrows without ceasing). Lola was very tired when she had  finished, but it had all been rapped out clearly and carefully, without  a single correction. Later I said: \"Lola, do you like being with me?\"  \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" \"ich gut ura?\" Now this was quite incomprehensible, so I  said: \"What do dogs feel when they look at the eyes and see the sorrows  of people?\" \"No.\" \"Yes, tell me?\" Then with hesitation: \"libe....\"  (Liebe = love) and to this day I feel touched at these answers. How  often in trouble and in sorrow have we not found relief in a dog's  sympathy, and been glad to call it a friend in our sufferings? How  often has not a dog's eye filled with understanding when its master has  sat alone and lost in grief--coming, perhaps, and gently laying its  head upon his knees--fixing its faithful gaze on him until at length he  might be moved to smile, feeling that--after all--he was not alone?  Dogs! may this not be your true vocation? Indeed, this thought  possessed me for a long time. This sensitive aspect had not been so  apparent to me until now ... I had been so keen on the objective tests  and on all that they meant--and now I was almost ready to reproach  myself, for had I not centred my love and intelligence on science  alone: and only in a secondary sense upon the dog?...    16 December, 1916. On this date I returned to the subject, and said to  Lola: \"Why do dogs go to people when they see them in sorrow--what is  it they then want?\" \"tresten\" (troesten = to console).    \"Tell me, Lola, of all the people you know, who has the most sorrows?\"  \"herni ...\" But she hesitated, and then turned the \"r\" into an \"n,\" so  that I saw she meant me (Henny)--and yet the spelling had been done  with some uncertainty, so I said: \"I thought you would have named  someone else, whom all dogs love--do you know who I mean?\" \"Yes.\"    \"Did you mean my friend?\" \"No.\" \"Who then?\" \"her zigler!\" (Herr Dr.  Ziegler) \"Then why did you tell a story just now? Did you think I  should be pleased to think you meant me?...\"    Later in the afternoon Lola was in a state of great depression; \"What  is the matter?\" I asked. \"er in or ist aus!\" I questioned her more  closely, so as to get at the meaning of this enigmatical remark: \"What  'in ear'?\" (or being meant for Ohr = ear). She replied: \"eid zu sagen\"  ( = oath to tell--or to say) adding \"ich auch aus\" ... ( = I also done  for). She looked absolutely miserable, and dropped down in a limp heap  between rapping out each word, as though bereft of all will-power. I  was beginning to feel quite distracted about her: \"Lola!\" I cried, \"Is  there no way of putting it right again? Oh, there must be!\" \"Yes.\"  \"Then I will help you!\" but again she rapped: \"er ist aus!\" (Ehre ist  aus = honour is gone). She could only answer concerning something she  had in her head, and she did so restlessly--though quite distinctly.  The whole thing seemed quite incredible! \"Lola!\" I urged, \"how can it  be put right?\" \"e zu....\" and here Lola cowered down miserably, and  remained so for the rest of the day.    17 December. To-day Lola ran away, returning at length as depressed as  ever and bleeding.

He, \"who spake as never man spake,\" knowing  the faith of the Syrophoenician woman, and giving her an opportunity  of manifesting it \"for our example,\" said, in the Syriac fashion of  thought, \"It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to  _the dogs_\" (Mark vii. 27). And the apostle John, in that wondrous close  of the prophetical writings, says, \"For without,\" _i.e._, outside of the  New Jerusalem, \"are _dogs_\" (Rev. xxii. 5). In the East up to the  present day, with but few exceptions, dogs are treated with great  dislike. We might quote passages in proof from almost every Eastern  traveller, and may venture to extract one from the graphic page of the  Rev. W. Graham, who lived five years in Syria, and who has given some  noble word-pictures of men, and streets, and scenes in Damascus and  other Turkish towns. Writing of Damascus,[53] he remarks, \"The dogs are  considered unclean, and are never domesticated in the East. They are  thin, lean, fox-like animals, and always at the starving point. They  live, breed, and die in the streets. They are useful as scavengers. They  are neither fondled nor persecuted, but simply tolerated; and no dog has  an owner, or ever follows and accompanies a man as the sheep do. I once  went out in the evening at Beyrout, with my teacher to enjoy the fresh  air and talk Arabic. My little English dog, the gift of a friend,  followed us. We passed through a garden, where a venerable Moslem was  sitting on a stone, silently and solemnly engaged in smoking his pipe.  He observed the dog _following_ us, and was astonished at it, as  something new and extraordinary; and rising, and making out of the way,  he cried out, 'May his father be accursed! Is that a dog or a fox?'\"  Again, in Damascus, should a worn-out horse, donkey, or camel die in the  streets, in a few hours the dogs have devoured it; and the powerful rays  of the sun dry up all corrupt matter. Mr Graham tells us that the dogs  of Damascus are brown, blackish, or of an ash colour, and that he saw no  white or spotted specimens. He never saw a case of hydrophobia, nor did  he hear a _bark_. The dogs \"howl, and make noise enough,\" he continues,  \"but the fine, well-defined _bow-wow_ is entirely wanting.\" With a quiet  humour, he hints at the bark being a mark of the civilised, domesticated  dog, and as denoting, apparently, \"the refinement of canine education.\"  We have been struck with the attempts of Penny's Esquimaux dogs,  deposited by the gallant Arctic mariner in the Zoological Gardens, to  _get up_ a bark somewhat like the \"well-bred\" dogs in the cages near  them. Mr Graham tells us of the Damascus dogs having established a kind  of police among themselves, and, like the rooks, driving all intruders  far from their district.    Dogs were not always disregarded in the East. Herodotus informs us,[54]  during the Persian occupation the number of Indian dogs kept in the  province of Babylon for the use of the governor was so great, that four  cities were exempted from taxes for maintaining them. In the mountain  parts of India, travellers describe the great dogs of Thibet and  Cashmere as being much prized.    \"The domestic dog of Ladak,\" says Major Cunningham,[55] \"is the  well-known shepherd's dog, or Thibetan mastiff. They have shaggy coats,  generally quite black, or black and tan; but I have seen some of a light  brown colour. They are usually ill-tempered to strangers; but I have  never found one that would face a stick, although they can fight well  when attacked. The only peculiarity that I have noticed about them is,  that the tail is nearly always curled upward on to the back, where the  hair is displaced by the constant rubbing of the tail.\" And that the  same massive variety was also prized in ancient times we know, by a  singularly fine, small bas-relief in baked clay, found in 1849 in the  Birs-i-Nimrud, Babylon, by Sir Henry Rawlinson, which is preserved in  the British Museum, to which it was presented by the late Prince Albert,  and an outline of which, reduced one-half, will convey a good idea to  the reader of its form. We may add that this bas-relief was first  noticed and figured, in 1851, in the third edition of a truly learned  and excellent work on \"Nineveh and Persepolis,\" by Mr Vaux of the  British Museum (p. 183). These dogs, then, were nothing else than big,  \"low jowled\" Thibetan mastiffs, such as we occasionally see brought over  by some Indian officer; and the use for which they were employed by the  ancient kings and their attendants is strikingly exhibited on some slabs  from a chamber in the north palace of Koujunjik, a part of the great  Nineveh. On some of these slabs, dogs are seen engaged in pulling down  wild asses, deer, and other animals; and they were evidently kept also  to assist in securing nobler game--\"the king of beasts;\"--the sport of  which animals shows how truly the Assyrian king was named \"Nimrod, the  mighty hunter before the Lord.\"--_Adam White, in \"Excelsior\" (with  additions)._    [Illustration]      BISHOP BLOMFIELD BITTEN BY A DOG.    His natural temperament was quick, and he was fond of authority. \"A  saying of Sydney Smith's has been preserved, humorously illustrative of  the view which he took of Bishop Blomfield's character. The bishop had  been bitten by a dog in the calf of the leg, and fearing possible  hydrophobia in consequence, he went, with characteristic promptitude, to  have the injured piece of flesh cut out by a surgeon before he returned  home. Two or three on whom he called were not at home; but, at last, the  operation was effected by the eminent surgeon, Mr Keate. The same  evening the bishop was to have dined with a party where Sydney Smith was  a guest. Just before dinner, a note arrived, saying that he was unable  to keep his engagement, a dog having rushed out from the crowd and  bitten him in the leg. When this note was read aloud to the company,  Sydney Smith's comment was, '_I should like to hear the dog's account of  the story_.'    \"When this accident occurred to him, Bishop Blomfield happened to be  walking with Dr D'Oyly, the rector of Lambeth. A lady of strong  Protestant principles, mistaking Dr D'Oyly for Dr Doyle, said that she  considered it was a judgment upon the bishop for keeping such  company.\"[56]      \"PUPPIES NEVER SEE TILL THEY ARE NINE DAYS OLD.\"    It is related, that when a former Bishop of Bristol held the office of  Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, he one day met a couple  of under-graduates, who neglected to pay the accustomed compliment of  _capping_. The bishop inquired the reason of the neglect. The two men  begged his lordship's pardon, observing they were _freshmen_, and did  not know him. \"How long have you been in Cambridge?\" asked his lordship.  \"Only _eight_ days,\" was the reply. \"Very good,\" said the bishop;  \"_puppies_ never see till they are _nine_ days old.\"[57]      MRS ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING'S DOG FLUSH.    Few have written so lovingly on the dog as this gifted poetess. Her dog  Flush is described so well that Landseer could paint the creature almost  to a hair. She has entered into the very feeling created in us by this  favoured pet of our race. The beautiful stanzas[58] I have copied give  also many little touches of her autobiography. This gifted lady was long  an invalid. She could enter with rare sympathy into Cowper's attachments  to animals. Her experience of the friendship of Flush is well told in  the following lines, so different from Lord Byron's misanthropic verses  on his dog:--         TO FLUSH, MY DOG.       Loving friend, the gift of one     Who her own true faith has run       Through her lower nature,     Be my benediction said     With my hand upon thy head,       Gentle fellow-creature!       Like a lady's ringlets brown     Flow thy silken ears adown       Either side demurely     Of thy silver-suited breast,     Shining out from all the rest       Of thy body purely.       Darkly brown thy body is,     Till the sunshine, striking this,       Alchemise its dulness,     When the sleek curls manifold     Flash all over into gold       With a burnish'd fulness.       Underneath my stroking hand,     Startled eyes of hazel bland       Kindling, growing larger,     Up thou leapest with a spring,     Full of prank and curveting       Leaping like a charger.       Leap! thy broad tail waves a light;     Leap! thy slender feet are bright,       Canopied in fringes;     Leap! those tassell'd ears of thine     Flicker strangely, fair and fine,       Down their golden inches.       Yet, my pretty, sporting friend,     Little is 't to such an end       That I praise thy rareness;     Other dogs may be thy peers     Haply in these drooping ears       And this glossy fairness.       But of _thee_ it shall be said,     This dog watch'd beside a bed       Day and night unweary--     Watch'd within a curtain'd room,     Where no sunbeam brake the gloom,       Round the sick and dreary.       Roses gather'd for a vase     In that chamber died apace,       Beam and breeze resigning;     This dog only waited on,     Knowing that, when light is gone,       Love remains for shining.       Other dogs in thymy dew     Track'd the hares, and follow'd through       Sunny moor or meadow;     This dog only crept and crept     Next a languid cheek that slept,       Sharing in the shadow.       Other dogs of loyal cheer     Bounded at the whistle clear,       Up the woodside hieing;     This dog only watch'd in reach     Of a faintly-utter'd speech,       Or a louder sighing.       And if one or two quick tears     Dropp'd upon his glossy ears,       Or a sigh came double,     Up he sprang in eager haste,     Fawning, fondling, breathing fast       In a tender"]]]
