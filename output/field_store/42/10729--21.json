And thus Christianity  and morality, courage, and intellect, and art all crumbling together  into one wreck, we are hurried on to the fall of Italy, the revolution  in France, and the condition of art in England (saved by her  Protestantism from severer penalty) in the time of George II.    \"I have not written in vain if I have heretofore done any thing towards  diminishing the reputation of the Renaissance landscape painting. But  the harm which has been done by Claude and the Poussins is as nothing  when compared to the mischief effected by Palladio, Scamozzi, and  Sansovino. Claude and the Poussins were weak men, and have had no  serious influence on the general mind. There is little harm in their  works being purchased at high prices: their real influence is very  slight, and they may be left without grave indignation to their poor  mission of furnishing drawing-rooms and assisting stranded conversation.  Not so the Renaissance architecture. Raised at once into all the  magnificence of which it was capable by Michael Angelo, then taken up by  men of real intellect and imagination, such as Scamozzi, Sansovino,  Inigo Jones, and Wren, it is impossible to estimate the extent of its  influence on the European mind; and that the more, because few persons  are concerned with painting, and, of those few, the larger number regard  it with slight attention; but all men are concerned with architecture,  and have at some time of their lives serious business with it. It does  not much matter that an individual loses two or three hundred pounds in  buying a bad picture, but it is to be regretted that a nation should  lose two or three hundred thousand in raising a ridiculous building. Nor  is it merely wasted wealth or distempered conception which we have to  regret in this Renaissance architecture: but we shall find in it partly  the root, partly the expression of certain dominant evils of modern  times--over-sophistication and ignorant classicalism; the one destroying  the healthfulness of general society, the other rendering our schools  and universities useless to a large number of the men who pass through  them.    \"Now Venice, as she was once the most religious, was in her fall the  most corrupt, of European states; and as she was in her strength the  centre of the pure currents of Christian architecture, so she is in her  decline the source of the Renaissance. It was the originality and  splendor of the palaces of Vicenza and Venice which gave this school its  eminence in the eyes of Europe; and the dying city, magnificent in her  dissipation, and graceful in her follies, obtained wider worship in her  decrepitude than in her youth, and sank from the midst of her admirers  into the grave.    \"It is in Venice, therefore, and in Venice only, that effectual blows  can be struck at this pestilent art of the Renaissance. Destroy its  claims to admiration there, and it can assert them nowhere else.\"          CONTRASTED PORTRAITS OF MARIE ANTOINETTE.      In the last number of _The International_ we quoted the remarks of Lord  Holland upon the character of the wife of Louis XVI. The sketch  presented by the noble author has been the subject of much and various  criticism. The London _Times_ says:         \"The virtue of the unfortunate consort of a most unhappy       monarch is without a flaw. Enmity, hatred, and every evil       passion, have done their worst to palliate murder and to       blacken innocence, but the ineradicable spot cannot be fixed to       the fair fame of this true woman. Faultless she was not. We are       under no obligation to vindicate her imprudent, wilful, and       fatal interference with public questions in which she had no       concern; we say nothing of her ignorance of the high matters of       state into which her uninformed zeal conducted her, to the       bitter cost of herself and of those she loved dearest on earth;       but of her purity, her uprightness, her beneficence, her       devotion, her sweet, playful, happy disposition, in the midst       of those home endearments, which were to her the true       occupation and charm of life, there cannot exist a doubt.       Misfortune fell upon her house to strengthen her love and to       confirm her piety. Persecution, imprisonment, calamity that has       never been surpassed, and a dreadful end, which, in its       bitterness, has seldom been equalled, found and left her, a       meek but perfect heroine. One historian has told us, that as       'an affectionate daughter and a faithful wife, she preserved in       the two most corrupted courts of Europe the simplicity and       affections of domestic life.' It is sufficient to add, that she       ascended the scaffold enjoining her children to a scrupulous       discharge of duty, to forgive her murderers, to forget her       wrongs; and that her last words on earth were directed to the       beloved husband who had preceded her, whose spirit she was       eager to rejoin, yet whose bed, if we are to believe my Lord       Holland, she had oftener than once defiled.\"    And _The Times_ intimates elsewhere that Lord Holland is alone among  reputable authors in condemning the Queen. How _The Times_ regards  THOMAS JEFFERSON, we cannot tell, but certainly it is claimed by our  democracy that he was a witness with a character. Jefferson says of  Marie Antoinette:         \"The King was now become a passive machine in the hands of the       National Assembly, and had he been left to himself, he would       have willingly acquiesced in whatever they should devise as       best for the nation. A wise constitution would have been       formed, hereditary in his line, himself placed at its head,       with powers so large, as to enable him to do all the good of       his station, and so limited, as to restrain him from its abuse.       This he would have faithfully administered, and more than this,       I do not believe, he ever wished. But he had a Queen of       absolute sway over his weak mind, and timid virtue, and of a       character, the reverse of his in all points. This angel, as       gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with some smartness       of fancy, but no sound sense, was proud, disdainful of       restraint, indignant at all obstacles to her will, eager in the       pursuit of pleasure, and firm enough to hold to her desires, or       perish in their wreck. Her inordinate gambling and       dissipations, with those of the Count d'Artois, and others of       her _clique_, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the       treasury, which called into action the reforming hand of the       nation; and her opposition to it, her inflexible perverseness,       and dauntless spirit, led herself to the guillotine, drew the       King on with her, and plunged the world into crimes and       calamities which will for ever stain the pages of modern       history. I have ever believed, that had there been no Queen,       there would have been no revolution. No force would have been       provoked, nor exercised. The King would have gone hand in hand       with the wisdom of his sounder counsellors, who, guided by the       increased lights of the age, wished only, with the same pace,       to advance the principles of their social constitution. The       deed which closed the mortal course of these sovereigns, I       shall neither approve nor condemn. I am not prepared to say,       that the first magistrate of a nation cannot commit treason       against his country, or is unamenable to its punishment; nor       yet, that where there is no written law, no regulated tribunal,       there is not a law in our hearts, and a power in our hands,       given for righteous employment in maintaining right, and       redressing wrong. Of those who judged the King, many thought       him wilfully criminal; many, that his existence would keep the       nation in perpetual conflict with the horde of Kings, who would       war against a regeneration which might come home to themselves,       and that it were better that one should die than all. I should       not have voted with this portion of the legislature. I should       have shut up the Queen in a convent, putting harm out of her       power, and placed the King in his station, investing him with       limited powers, which, I verily believe, he would have honestly       exercised, according to the measure of his understanding. In       this way, no void would have been created, courting the       usurpation of a military adventurer, nor occasion given for       those enormities which demoralized the nations of the world,       and destroyed, and is yet to destroy, millions and millions of       its inhabitants.\"    A majority of the French authors of the time agree with Mr. Jefferson.          HINDOSTANEE NEWSPAPERS: THE FLYING SHEETS OF BENARES.      One of the most successful applications of lithography is in the  reproduction of the Hindostanee or Persian writing, used in India. It is  too irregular and complicated to be represented by ordinary types.  Accordingly lithographic printing establishments have been set up in the  principal cities of India, where original works, translations of the  ancient tongues of Asia or the modern ones of Europe, as well as  newspapers are published. Calcutta, Serampore, Lakhnau, Madras, Bombay,  Pounah, were the first cities to have these printing offices, but since  then a great number have been established in the north-west provinces,  where the Hindostanee is the sole language employed. A year since that  part of the country contained twenty-eight offices, which in 1849  produced a hundred and forty-one different works, while the number of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25341"],[0,"The 28th: A Record of War Service in the Australian Imperial Force, 1915-19, (#17)"],[1,"landed.

Pritchard._]    The \"Sarnia\" stopped her engines when about a mile from the shore.  Almost at once one or two flat craft, black in colour and without funnel  or rigging, were observed approaching. As they drew alongside a staff  officer came up the transport's gangway and delivered the orders for  landing the troops. The disembarkation commenced at once--the officers  and men filing down the gangway on to the waiting barges. These barges  had been given the name of \"beetles.\" They were constructed of  bullet-proof iron plates, were propelled by motor engines set astern,  could attain a racing speed of five knots, and were designed to carry 50  horses or 500 men with stores, ammunition and water. Built for the  Suvla landing, the \"beetles\" had fully proved their usefulness, but  certainly they lacked every element of comfort.    During the disembarkation it was noted that a destroyer had moved in on  the right and was directing her searchlight on Gaba Tepe and vicinity.  This prevented any observation of the landing process from the direction  of the Turkish lines in that quarter. Occasionally she fired her guns  and generally gave the impression of intense watchfulness.    By midnight everybody was free of the ship, and the Battalion, leaving  Williams' Pier and guided by a staff officer, stumbled along the beach  in a northerly direction for a little over a mile to the shelter of  Waterfall Gully--a small hollow in the western side of Bauchop's Hill.  Two platoons of \"A\" Company, under Captain Montgomery, had been left on  the beach for fatigue duty there. They did not rejoin the unit until the  25th September.    Fatigued with the long day, and overburdened with the load of equipment,  rest was the first essential. An attempt was made to form a bivouac, but  so small was the space available, and so rough the ground, that the idea  had to be abandoned. The men were told to lie down where they  were--amongst disused trenches, numerous latrine pits, and close to the  remains of the 5th Connaught Rangers (88th) who had been decimated in  the fighting of the previous month.    During the night two companies of the 27th Battalion, under Major  Jeffrey, were landed. Within 24 hours the Brigadier and staff and the  remaining units of the brigade were also disembarked and sheltered in  various features near the beach. For the time being the brigade formed  part of the New Zealand and Australian Division which normally consisted  of the N.Z. Mounted Rifle Brigade and the N.Z. and 4th Australian  Infantry Brigades, together with certain artillery, engineers, and other  troops. The division was commanded by Major-General Sir A. J. Godley,  K.C.M.G.    At dawn of the 11th September, those of the 28th who were still sleeping  were rudely awakened by guns firing close at hand. A destroyer had moved  in to within a few cable lengths of the shore and was viciously shooting  over the heads of the infantry at some target which the enemy on Sari  Bair afforded.    During the next few hours contact was gained with the 16th Battalion in  reserve in Hay Valley near by. The new arrivals were heartily welcomed  by the exhausted remains of that famous unit whose adjutant was, on this  morning, shot through the chest whilst on his way to visit the 28th. Nor  did the inhabitants of Waterfall Gully escape the hostile bullet, for  before noon two members (Private F. T. Mitchell was the first) were hit  when they left the shelter of the valley to proceed to a well (kuyu) on  the adjacent beach. These were the earliest casualties as a result of  the enemy's fire.    Orders having been received to relieve the 4th Australian Infantry  Brigade, astride the Aghyl Dere, a party moved up and, after the C.O.  had conferred with Colonel Monash, reconnoitred the advanced positions.  Later in the day these orders were cancelled, and the 28th was directed  to take over the \"Apex\" salient from the Otago Battalion, N.Z. Infantry.  At 7 o'clock that evening Waterfall Gully was evacuated and the  Battalion moved up the Chailak Dere to the ravines between Bauchop's  Hill, Little Table Top, and Rose Hill. There the night was spent and  next evening, the \"Apex\" position having been reconnoitred, \"C\" and \"D\"  Companies moved to the front line and relieved the New Zealanders. \"A\"  and \"B\" Companies took up a position in reserve some 300 yards in rear,  near the head of the Chailak Dere. One platoon of \"A\" Company and the  Machine Gun Section were posted on Canterbury Slope--a position in  support of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and on the left flank of  Rhododendron Spur.    The position the Battalion was now responsible for was the neck or  junction of the Rhododendron Spur with the Sari Bair feature. On the  right was the Sazli Beit Dere, and on the left the southern arm of the  Aghyl Dere. Behind was the ravine of the Chailak. The trenches ran along  in a pothook shape from Rhododendron Spur down to the Cheshire Ridge, on  the north side. Opposite to the centre was the actual summit, which was  called the \"Pinnacle,\" and was held by the Turks. Here they had erected  a block house, which stood about 50 yards from our own trench. The enemy  earthworks lined the opposite sides of the gullies at a range varying  from 100 to 250 yards from our position--the right of which could be  enfiladed from the blockhouse.    To hold this salient was of vital importance. Its loss would have  severed the Australian line, turned the flank of the Cheshire Ridge, and  exposed to enfilade fire most of the ground gained to the northward  during the August fighting. A strong garrison and special vigilance were  both necessary. To this post of honour the Western Australian portion of  the 7th Infantry Brigade was allotted by reason of the high standard of  efficiency it had attained during the training period.    The remainder of the 7th Brigade was disposed as follows:--25th and 27th  Battalions on Cheshire Ridge, the left of the former resting on the  Aghyl Dere, and the right of the 27th joining up with the 28th, near  Apex. The 26th Battalion was held in Divisional Reserve, at Taylor's  Hollow, and supplied working parties for engineering and beach duties.  One company of the 27th was available as a reserve in the hands of the  Brigadier, who was located about half-a-mile from the front line, at the  Western foot of Table Top.    [Illustration: THE TRENCHES AT \"THE APEX.\"  _Map by Australian War Museum._]    For tactical purposes, the \"Apex\" position was divided into four  posts--numbered from the right. \"C\" Company took Nos. 1 and 2 and was  afterwards relieved by \"B\" Company. \"D\" Company took Nos. 3 and 4 and  later handed over to \"A\" Company. Nos. 3 and 4 Posts were the closer to  the enemy and, consequently, of greater importance. Each post was  further divided into a certain number of Groups--each under a  Non-commissioned Officer. Three machine guns were mounted in the  parapet. After the first week, Lieut. Shaw took these over and also  mounted additional guns in secret emplacements, which were constructed  by digging through the escarp and tunnelling forward and upward.    The trenches were at least six feet deep and excavated in a kind of  conglomerate, which needed very little revetting and was a good bullet  or splinter stopper. A ledge or firestep ran along the inside of the  trench. Upon this the garrison stood if an attack was to be repelled.  The instructions for the posts required that men in them were to be  always in a state of readiness, _i.e._, rifle loaded, bayonet fixed, and  equipment worn. One man in each group acted as sentry. He usually sat on  a bag full of earth, placed on the firestep, and by means of a  periscope, watched for any movement of the enemy. In the wall of the  trench little excavations held boxes of reserve ammunition and  hand-bombs of various sorts.    The trenches having been commenced only a few weeks earlier, were in a  very incomplete state and required much labour and development.  Especially was this so in connection with the main communication  trenches. Support trenches had also to be constructed and excavations  made to establish a direct covered way to the Light Horse, on the  southern face of the Rhododendron Spur. These works were undertaken by  men from the supports and Battalion reserve. Many hard, long, weary  hours were put in with the pick and shovel and the sandbag--which last  was the only means of carrying away the spoil.    The defence at first was without any properly arranged plan for support  from the artillery or flanking units. Before the brigade left the  sector, however, the New Zealand Field Artillery Brigade, a British  6-inch Howitzer Battery, and a 4.7-inch Battery, all had their lines  laid down for fire to cover the front. An Indian Mountain Battery also  lay in a nook in the Chailak Dere--ready for any emergency. In addition,  no less than 31 machine guns--in front and on the flanks--could be  brought to bear on the threatened point. To assist in the machine gun  work, and advise on local conditions, the Battalion was fortunate in  having attached to it for a time Captain Rose, a British Service  officer of the Division, and that gallant soldier, Lieut Percy Black,  D.C.M.,[M] 16th Battalion.
