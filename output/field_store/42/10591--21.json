[Illustration: THE COLONIAL SURPRISE-PARTY AT TRENTON.]    Marie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, fought  bravely with the Americans in this battle, twice having his name shot  from under him.    The patriots were routed, scoring a goose-egg and losing Philadelphia.    October 4, Washington attacked the enemy at Germantown, and was beaten  back just as victory was arranging to perch on his banner. Poor  Washington now retired to Valley Forge, where he put in about the  dullest winter of his life.    The English had not been so successful in the North. At first the  Americans could only delay Burgoyne by felling trees in the path of his  eight thousand men, which is a very unsatisfactory sort of warfare, but  at last Schuyler, who had borne the burden and heat of the day, was  succeeded by Gates, and good luck seemed to come slowly his way.    A foolish boy with bullet-holes cut in his clothes ran into St. Leger's  troops, and out of breath told them to turn back or they would fill a  drunkard's grave. Officers asked him about the numbers of the enemy, and  he pointed to the leaves of the trees, shrieked, and ran for his life.  He ran several days, and was barely able to keep ahead of St. Leger's  troops by a neck.    Burgoyne at another time sent a detachment under Colonel Baum to take  the stores at Bennington, Vermont. He was met by General Stark and the  militia. Stark said, \"Here come the redcoats, and we must beat them  to-day, or Molly Stark is a widow.\" This neat little remark made an  instantaneous hit, and when they counted up their string of prisoners  at night they found they had six hundred souls and a Hessian.    Burgoyne now felt blue and unhappy. Besides, his troops were covered  with wood-ticks and had had no washing done for three weeks.    He moved southward and attacked Gates at Bemis Heights, or, as a British  wit had it, \"gave Gates ajar,\" near Saratoga. A wavering fight occupied  the day, and then both armies turned in and fortified for two weeks.  Burgoyne saw that he was running out of food, and so was first to open  fire.    Arnold, who had been deprived of his command since the last battle,  probably to prevent his wiping out the entire enemy and getting  promoted, was so maddened by the conflict that he dashed in before Gates  could put him in the guard-house, and at the head of his old command,  and without authority or hat, led the attack. Gates did not dare to come  where Arnold was, to order him back, for it was a very warm place where  Arnold was at the time. The enemy was thus driven to camp.    Arnold was shot in the same leg that was wounded at Quebec; so he was  borne back to the extreme rear, where he found Gates eating a doughnut  and speaking disrespectfully of Arnold.    A council was now held in Burgoyne's tent, and on the question of  renewing the fight stood six to six, when an eighteen-pound hot shot  went through the tent, knocking a stylographic pen out of General  Burgoyne's hand. Almost at once he decided to surrender, and the entire  army of six thousand men was surrendered, together with arms, portable  bath-tubs, and leather hat-boxes. The Americans marched into their camp  to the tune of Yankee Doodle, which is one of the most impudent  compositions ever composed.    [Illustration: KNOCKING A STYLOGRAPHIC PEN OUT OF BURGOYNE'S HAND.]    During the Valley Forge winter (1777-78) Continental currency  depreciated in value so that an officer's pay would not buy his clothes.  Many, having also spent their private funds for the prosecution of the  war, were obliged to resign and hire out in the lumber woods in order to  get food for their families. Troops had no blankets, and straw was not  to be had. It was extremely sad; but there was no wavering. Officers  were approached by the enemy with from one hundred to one thousand  pounds if they would accept and use their influence to effect a  reconciliation; but, with blazing eye and unfaltering attitude, each  stated that he was not for sale, and returned to his frozen mud-hole to  rest and dream of food and freedom.    Those were the untitled nobility from whom we sprung. Let us look over  our personal record and see if we are living lives that are worthy of  such heroic sires.    Five minutes will now be given the reader to make a careful examination  of his personal record.           *       *       *       *       *    In the spring the joyful news came across the sea that, through the  efforts of Benjamin Franklin, France had acknowledged the independence  of the United States, and a fleet was on the way to assist the  struggling troops.    The battle of Monmouth occurred June 28. Clinton succeeded Howe, and,  alarmed by the news of the French fleet, the government ordered Clinton  to concentrate his troops near New York, where there were better  facilities for getting home.    Washington followed the enemy across New Jersey, overtaking them at  Monmouth. Lee was in command, and got his men tangled in a swamp where  the mosquitoes were quite plenty, and, losing courage, ordered a  retreat.    Washington arrived at that moment, and bitterly upbraided Lee. He used  the Flanders method of upbraiding, it is said, and Lee could not stand  it. He started towards the enemy in preference to being there with  Washington, who was still rebuking him. The fight was renewed, and all  day long they fought. When night came, Clinton took his troops with him  and went away where they could be by themselves.    An effort was made to get up a fight between the French fleet and the  English at Newport for the championship, but a severe storm came up and  prevented it.    In July the Wyoming Massacre, under the management of the Tories and  Indians, commanded by Butler, took place in that beautiful valley near  Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.    This massacre did more to make the Indians and Tories unpopular in this  country than any other act of the war. The men were away in the army,  and the women, children, and old men alone were left to the vengeance of  the two varieties of savage. The Indians had never had gospel  privileges, but the Tories had. Otherwise they resembled each other.    In 1779 the English seemed to have Georgia and the South pretty well to  themselves. Prevost, the English general, made an attack on Charleston,  but, learning that Lincoln was after him, decided that, as he had a  telegram to meet a personal friend at Savannah, he would go there. In  September, Lincoln, assisted by the French under D'Estaing, attacked  Savannah. One thousand lives were lost, and D'Estaing showed the white  feather to advantage. Count Pulaski lost his life in this fight. He was  a brave Polish patriot, and his body was buried in the Savannah River.    The capture of Stony Point about this time by \"Mad Anthony Wayne\" was  one of the most brilliant battles of the war.    [Illustration: THE ONLY THING WAYNE WAS AFRAID OF.]    Learning the countersign from a negro who sold strawberries to the  British, the troops passed the guard over the bridge that covered the  marsh, and, gagging the worthy inside guard, they marched up the hill  with fixed bayonets and fixed the enemy to the number of six hundred.    The countersign was, \"The fort is won,\" and so it was, in less time than  it takes to ejaculate the word \"scat!\" Wayne was wounded at the outset,  but was carried up the hill in command, with a bandage tied about his  head. He was a brave man, and never knew in battle what fear was. Yet,  strange to say, a bat in his bed would make him start up and turn pale.          CHAPTER XVIII.    THE CLOSE OF THE REVOLUTION.      The atrocities introduced into this country by the Tories and Indians  caused General Sullivan to go out against the measly enemy, whip him  near Elmira, and destroy the fields of corn and villages in the Genesee  country, where the Indian women were engaged in farming while their  men-folks attended to the massacre industry.    The weak point with the Americans seemed to be lack of a suitable navy.  A navy costs money, and the Colonists were poor. In 1775 they fitted out  several swift sailing-vessels, which did good service. Inside of five  years they captured over five hundred ships, cruised among the British  isles, and it is reported that they captured war-vessels that were tied  to the English wharves.    [Illustration: GENERAL GATES'S PROPER CAREER.]    Paul Jones had a method of running his vessel alongside the enemy's,  lashing the two together, and then having it out with the crew,  generally winning in a canter. His idea in lashing the two ships  together was to have one good ship to ride home on. Generally it was the  one he captured, while his own, which was rotten, was allowed to go  down. This was especially the case in the fight between the Richard and  the Serapis, September 23, 1779.    In 1780 the war was renewed in South Carolina. Charleston, after a forty  days' siege, was forced to surrender. Gates now took charge of the  South, and also gave a sprinting exhibition at Camden, where he was  almost wiped off the face of the earth. He had only two troops left at  the close of the battle, and they could not keep up with Gates in the  retreat. This battle and the retreat overheated Gates and sowed the  seeds of heart-disease, from which he never recovered. He should have  chosen a more peaceful life, such as the hen-traffic, or the growth of  asparagus for the market.    Benedict Arnold has been severely reproached in history, but he was a  brave soldier, and possibly serving under Gates, who jealously kept him  in the background, had a good deal to do with the little European dicker  which so darkened his brilliant career as a soldier.    [Illustration: ARNOLD'S RECEPTION IN ENGLAND.]    Unhappy man! He was not well received in England, and, though a  brilliant man, was forced to sit in a corner evening after evening and  hear the English tell his humorous stories"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#17)"],[1," he might almost be excused, for he  was of a family noble even in Rome--a circumstance which in that  age justified any assumption. In the terrible wars between the  first Caesar and his great enemies, a Messala had been the friend  of Brutus. After Philippi, without sacrifice of his honor, he and  the conqueror became reconciled. Yet later, when Octavius disputed  for the empire, Messala supported him. Octavius, as the Emperor  Augustus, remembered the service, and showered the family with  honors. Among other things, Judea being reduced to a province,  he sent the son of his old client or retainer to Jerusalem,  charged with the receipt and management of the taxes levied  in that region; and in that service the son had since remained,  sharing the palace with the high-priest. The youth just described  was his son, whose habit it was to carry about with him all too  faithfully a remembrance of the relation between his grandfather  and the great Romans of his day.    The associate of the Messala was slighter in form, and his  garments were of fine white linen and of the prevalent style  in Jerusalem; a cloth covered his head, held by a yellow cord,  and arranged so as to fall away from the forehead down low over  the back of the neck. An observer skilled in the distinctions of  race, and studying his features more than his costume, would have  soon discovered him to be of Jewish descent. The forehead of the  Roman was high and narrow, his nose sharp and aquiline, while his  lips were thin and straight, and his eyes cold and close under  the brows. The front of the Israelite, on the other hand, was low  and broad; his nose long, with expanded nostrils; his upper lip,  slightly shading the lower one, short and curving to the dimpled  corners, like a Cupid's bow; points which, in connection with the  round chin, full eyes, and oval cheeks reddened with a wine-like  glow, gave his face the softness, strength, and beauty peculiar  to his race. The comeliness of the Roman was severe and chaste,  that of the Jew rich and voluptuous.    \"Did you not say the new procurator is to arrive to-morrow?\"    The question proceeded from the younger of the friends, and was couched  in Greek, at the time, singularly enough, the language everywhere  prevalent in the politer circles of Judea; having passed from the  palace into the camp and college; thence, nobody knew exactly when  or how, into the Temple itself, and, for that matter, into precincts  of the Temple far beyond the gates and cloisters--precincts of a  sanctity intolerable for a Gentile.    \"Yes, to-morrow,\" Messala answered.    \"Who told you?\"    \"I heard Ishmael, the new governor in the palace--you call him  high priest--tell my father so last night. The news had been  more credible, I grant you, coming from an Egyptian, who is of a  race that has forgotten what truth is, or even from an Idumaean,  whose people never knew what truth was; but, to make quite certain,  I saw a centurion from the Tower this morning, and he told me  preparations were going on for the reception; that the armorers  were furbishing the helmets and shields, and regilding the eagles  and globes; and that apartments long unused were being cleansed  and aired as if for an addition to the garrison--the body-guard,  probably, of the great man.\"    A perfect idea of the manner in which the answer was given cannot  be conveyed, as its fine points continually escape the power behind  the pen. The reader's fancy must come to his aid; and for that he  must be reminded that reverence as a quality of the Roman mind was  fast breaking down, or, rather, it was becoming unfashionable.  The old religion had nearly ceased to be a faith; at most it was  a mere habit of thought and expression, cherished principally by  the priests who found service in the Temple profitable, and the  poets who, in the turn of their verses, could not dispense with the  familiar deities: there are singers of this age who are similarly  given. As philosophy was taking the place of religion, satire was  fast substituting reverence; insomuch that in Latin opinion it was  to every speech, even to the little diatribes of conversation, as  salt to viands, and aroma to wine. The young Messala, educated in  Rome, but lately returned, had caught the habit and manner;  the scarce perceptible movement of the outer corner of the  lower eyelid, the decided curl of the corresponding nostril,  and a languid utterance affected as the best vehicle to convey  the idea of general indifference, but more particularly because  of the opportunities it afforded for certain rhetorical pauses  thought to be of prime importance to enable the listener to take  the happy conceit or receive the virus of the stinging epigram.  Such a stop occurred in the answer just given, at the end of the  allusion to the Egyptian and Idumaean. The color in the Jewish  lad's cheeks deepened, and he may not have heard the rest of the  speech, for he remained silent, looking absently into the depths  of the pool.    \"Our farewell took place in this garden. 'The peace of the Lord go  with you!'--your last words. 'The gods keep you!' I said. Do you  remember? How many years have passed since then?\"    \"Five,\" answered the Jew, gazing into the water.    \"Well, you have reason to be thankful to--whom shall I say? The  gods? No matter. You have grown handsome; the Greeks would call  you beautiful--happy achievement of the years! If Jupiter would  stay content with one Ganymede, what a cup-bearer you would make  for the emperor! Tell me, my Judah, how the coming of the procurator  is of such interest to you.\"    Judah bent his large eyes upon the questioner; the gaze was  grave and thoughtful, and caught the Roman's, and held it  while he replied, \"Yes, five years. I remember the parting;  you went to Rome; I saw you start, and cried, for I love you.  The years are gone, and you have come back to me accomplished  and princely--I do not jest; and yet--yet--I do wish you were  the Messala you went away.\"    The fine nostril of the satirist stirred, and he put on a longer  drawl as he said, \"No, no; not a Ganymede--an oracle, my Judah.  A few lessons from my teacher of rhetoric hard by the Forum--I  will give you a letter to him when you become wise enough to  accept a suggestion which I am reminded to make you--a little  practise of the art of mystery, and Delphi will receive you as  Apollo himself. At the sound of your solemn voice, the Pythia  will come down to you with her crown. Seriously, O my friend,  in what am I not the Messala I went away? I once heard the  greatest logician in the world. His subject was Disputation.  One saying I remember--'Understand your antagonist before you  answer him.' Let me understand you.\"    The lad reddened under the cynical look to which he was subjected;  yet he replied, firmly, \"You have availed yourself, I see, of your  opportunities; from your teachers you have brought away much  knowledge and many graces. You talk with the ease of a master,  yet your speech carries a sting. My Messala, when he went away,  had no poison in his nature; not for the world would he have hurt  the feelings of a friend.\"    The Roman smiled as if complimented, and raised his patrician head  a toss higher.    \"O my solemn Judah, we are not at Dodona or Pytho. Drop the oracular,  and be plain. Wherein have I hurt you?\"    The other drew a long breath, and said, pulling at the cord about  his waist, \"In the five years, I, too, have learned somewhat.  Hillel may not be the equal of the logician you heard, and Simeon  and Shammai are, no doubt, inferior to your master hard by the Forum.  Their learning goes not out into forbidden paths; those who sit at  their feet arise enriched simply with knowledge of God, the law,  and Israel; and the effect is love and reverence for everything  that pertains to them. Attendance at the Great College, and study  of what I heard there, have taught me that Judea is not as she  used to be. I know the space that lies between an independent  kingdom and the petty province Judea is. I were meaner, viler,  than a Samaritan not to resent the degradation of my country.  Ishmael is not lawfully high-priest, and he cannot be while the  noble Hannas lives; yet he is a Levite; one of the devoted who  for thousands of years have acceptably served the Lord God of  our faith and worship. His--\"    Messala broke in upon him with a biting laugh.    \"Oh, I understand you now. Ishmael, you say, is a usurper, yet to  believe an Idumaean sooner than Ishmael is to sting like an adder.  By the drunken son of Semele, what it is to be a Jew! All men and  things, even heaven and earth, change; but a Jew never. To him  there is no backward, no forward; he is what his ancestor was  in the beginning. In this sand I draw you a circle--there! Now  tell me what more a Jew's life is? Round and round, Abraham here,  Isaac and Jacob yonder, God in the middle. And the circle--by the  master of all thunders! the circle is too large. I draw it again--\"  He stopped, put his thumb upon the ground, and swept the fingers  about it. \"See, the thumb spot is the Temple, the finger-lines  Judea. Outside the little space is there nothing of value? The  arts! Herod was a builder; therefore he is accursed. Painting,  sculpture! to look upon them is sin. Poetry you make fast to your  altars. Except in the synagogue, who of you attempts eloquence?  In war all you conquer in the six days you lose on the seventh.  Such your life and limit; who shall say no if I laugh at you?  Satisfied with the worship of such a people, what is your God  to our Roman Jove, who lends us his eagles that we may compass the  universe with our arms? Hillel, Simeon, Shammai, Abtalion--what are  they to the masters who teach that everything is worth knowing that  can be known?\"    The Jew arose, his face much flushed.    \"No, no; keep your place, my Judah, keep your place,\" Messala cried,  extending his"]]]
