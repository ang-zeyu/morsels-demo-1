[_They both seat themselves._]    _Vasantasena._ Is the merchant's son well?    _Maitreya._ Well, madam.    _Vasantasena._ Tell me, good Maitreya,        Do friends, like birds, yet seek a shelter free      Beneath the modest boughs of this fair tree,      Whose leaves are virtues, confidence its root,      Its blossoms honor, good its precious fruit?                 32    _Maitreya._ [_Aside._] A good description by a naughty woman.  [_Aloud._] They do, indeed.    _Vasantasena._ Tell me, what is the purpose of your coming?    _Maitreya._ Listen, madam. The excellent Charudatta folds his  hands[59] and requests--    _Vasantasena._ [_Folding her hands._] And commands--    _Maitreya._ He says he imagined that that golden casket was his  own and gambled it away. And nobody knows where the gambling-master  has gone, for he is employed in the king's business.    [74.9. S.    _Maid._ Mistress, I congratulate you. The gentleman has turned  gambler.    _Vasantasena._ [_Aside._] It was stolen by a thief, and he is so proud  that he says he gambled it away. I love him for that.    _Maitreya._ He requests that you will therefore be good enough to  accept in its place this necklace of pearls.    _Vasantasena._ [_Aside._] Shall I show him the jewels? [_Reflecting._]  No, not yet.    _Maitreya._ Why don't you take this necklace?    _Vasantasena._ [_Laughs and looks at her friend._] Why should I not  take the necklace, Maitreya? [_She takes it and lays it away. Aside._]  How is it possible that drops of honey fall from the mango-tree,  even after its blossoms are gone? [_Aloud._] Sir, pray tell the worthy  gambler Charudatta in my name that I shall pay him a visit this  evening.    _Maitreya._ [_Aside._] What else does she expect to get out of a visit  to our house? [_Aloud._] Madam, I will tell him--[_Aside_ to have  nothing more to do with this courtezan.                      [_Exit._    _Vasantasena._ Take these jewels, girl. Let us go and bring cheer  to Charudatta.    _Maid._ But mistress, see! An untimely storm is gathering.    _Vasant._        The clouds may come, the rain may fall forever,        The night may blacken in the sky above;      For this I care not, nor I will not waver;        My heart is journeying to him I love.                      33    Take the necklace, girl, and come quickly.

For see!      The peacocks gaze and lift their fans on high;        The swans forget their purpose to depart;      The untimely storm afflicts the blackened sky,        And the wistful lover's heart.                             1    And again:        The wet bull's belly wears no deeper dye;        In flashing lightning's golden mantle clad,        While cranes, his buglers, make the heaven glad,      The cloud, a second Vishnu,[61] mounts the sky.              2    And yet again:        As dark as Vishnu's form, with circling cranes      To trumpet him, instead of bugle strains,        And garmented in lightning's silken robe.      Approaches now the harbinger of rains.                       3        When lightning's lamp is lit, the silver river        Impetuous falls from out the cloudy womb;        Like severed lace from heaven-cloaking gloom,      It gleams an instant, then is gone forever.                  4        Like shoaling fishes, or like dolphins shy,      Or like to swans, toward heaven's vault that fly,        Like paired flamingos, male and mate together,      Like mighty pinnacles that tower on high.        In thousand forms the tumbling clouds embrace,        Though torn by winds, they gather, interlace,      And paint the ample canvas of the sky.                       5        The sky is black as Dhritarashtra's face;      Proud as the champion of Kuru's race.        The haughty peacock shrills his joy abroad;      The cuckoo, in Yudhishthira's sad case,        Is forced to wander if he would not die;        The swans must leave their forest-homes and fly,      Like Pandu's sons, to seek an unknown place.                 6    [_Reflecting._] It is long since Maitreya went to visit Vasantasena.  And even yet he does not come.      [_Enter Maitreya._]    [76.20. S.    _Maitreya._ Confound the courtezan's avarice and her incivility! To  think of her making so short a story of it! Over and over she  repeats something about the affection she feels, and then without  more ado she pockets the necklace. She is rich enough so that  she might at least have said: \"Good Maitreya, rest a little. You  must not go until you have had a cup to drink.\" Confound the  courtezan! I hope I 'll never set eyes on her again. [_Wearily._]  The proverb is right. \"It is hard to find a lotus-plant without a  root, a merchant who never cheats, a goldsmith who never steals,  a village-gathering without a fight, and a courtezan without avarice.\"  Well, I 'll find my friend and persuade him to have nothing  more to do with this courtezan. [_He walks about until he discovers  Charudatta._] Ah, my good friend is sitting in the orchard. I 'll  go to him. [_Approaching._] Heaven bless you! May happiness be  yours.    _Charudatta._ [_Looking up._] Ah, my friend Maitreya has returned.  You are very welcome, my friend. Pray be seated.    _Maitreya._ Thank you.    _Charudatta._ Tell me of your errand, my friend.    _Maitreya._ My errand went all wrong.    P. 132.8]    _Charudatta._ What! did she not accept the necklace?    _Maitreya._ How could we expect such a piece of luck? She put  her lotus-tender hands to her brow,[62] and took it.    _Charudatta._ Then why do you say \"went wrong\"?    _Maitreya._ Why not, when we lost a necklace that was the pride  of the four seas for a cheap golden casket, that was stolen before  we had a bite or a drink out of it?    _Charudatta._ Not so, my friend.        She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;      The price of confidence has no less measure.                 7    _Maitreya._ Now look here! I have a second grievance. She tipped  her friend the wink, covered her face with the hem of her dress,  and laughed at me. And so, Brahman though I am, I hereby fall  on my face before you and beg you not to have anything more  to do with this courtezan. That sort of society does any amount  of damage. A courtezan is like a pebble in your shoe. It hurts  before you get rid of it. And one thing more, my friend. A courtezan,  an elephant, a scribe, a mendicant friar, a swindler, and an  ass--where these dwell, not even rogues are born.    _Charudatta._ Oh, my friend, a truce to all your detraction! My  poverty of itself prevents me. For consider:        The horse would gladly hasten here and there,        But his legs fail him, for his breath departs.      So men's vain wishes wander everywhere,        Then, weary grown, return into their hearts.               8    Then too, my friend:        If wealth is thine, the maid is thine,        For maids are won by gold;    [_Aside._ And not by virtue cold. _Aloud._]        But wealth is now no longer mine,      And her I may not hold.                                      9    [78.23. S.    _Maitreya._ [_Looks down. Aside._] From the way he looks up and  sighs, I conclude that my effort to distract him has simply increased  his longing. The proverb is right. \"You can't reason with  a lover.\" [_Aloud._] Well, she told me to tell you that she would  have to come here this evening. I suppose she isn't satisfied with  the necklace and is coming to look for something else.    _Charudatta._ Let her come, my friend. She shall not depart unsatisfied.                                             [_Enter Kumbhilaka._]    _Kumbhilaka._ Listen, good people.        The more it rains in sheets,        The more my skin gets wet;      The more the cold wind beats,        The more I shake and fret.                                 10    [_He bursts out laughing._]        I make the sweet flute speak from seven holes,        I make the loud lute speak on seven strings;      In singing, I essay the donkey's roles:        No god can match my music when he sings.                   11    My mistress Vasantasena said to me \"Kumbhilaka, go and tell Charudatta  that I am coming.\" So here I am, on my way to Charudatta's house. [_He  walks about, and, as he enters, discovers Charudatta._] Here is  Charudatta in the orchard. And here is that wretched jackanapes, too.  Well, I'll go up to them. What! the orchard-gate is shut? Good! I'll  give this jackanapes a hint. [_He throws lumps of mud._]    _Maitreya._ Well! Who is this pelting me with mud, as if I were  an apple-tree inside of a fence?    _Charudatta._ Doubtless the pigeons that play on the roof of the  garden-house.    _Maitreya._ Wait a minute, you confounded pigeon! With this  stick I'll bring you down from the roof to the ground, like an  over-ripe mango. [_He raises his stick and starts to run._]    P. 136.8]    _Charudatta._ [_Holding him back by the sacred cord._] Sit down, my  friend. What do you mean? Leave the poor pigeon alone with his  mate.    _Kumbhilaka._ What! he sees the pigeon and doesn't see me? Good!

With  his usual tendency, he chose to imagine they were all bent on mischief  or folly, and because they happened to be in a certain street, and  because in that street he had frequently heard some of his fellow-  students speak of a low theatre, he jumped to the conclusion that every  one he saw was bound for this place.  Something impelled him to go  himself and take an exterior survey of this mysterious and much-spoken-  of building.  He found it; and, as he expected, he found people  thronging in, though not in the numbers he had anticipated.  He stood  and watched them for some time, and wondered what they were going to  see.    He went up and read the playbill.  He read the name of the play, the  titles of its acts, and the names of its actors.  He wondered if the man  who just then drove up in a hansom was one of the heroes of the piece,  or whether he was one of the performers in the farce announced to follow  the play.  Still the people streamed in.  There was no one he knew, and  no one knew him.    \"Strange,\" thought he, \"there are so many places in London where one  could go and no one ever know it.\"    He wished he could see what the place was like inside; it must surely be  crowded by this time.    Thus he dawdled for some time; then with a sigh and an effort he tore  himself away and walked quickly on to the Newcomes' house.  Their  welcome was most cordial.    \"We were afraid,\" said Mr Newcome, \"you had quite deserted us.  Come  in, it is pleasant to see you.  We had a letter from Charlie only to-  day, telling us to see you did not overwork yourself, and to make you  come up here whether you would or not.  Of course we could hardly follow  such instructions literally.\"    Tom spent a pleasant evening with the two good people.    He always had found Mr Newcome a clever and very entertaining man--a  man whom one feels all the better for talking to, and who naturally sets  every guest in his house at ease.  They talked much about Charlie and  his prospects.  They even consulted Tom as to the wisdom of yielding to  the boy's desire for a military career, and Tom strongly supported the  idea.    Then Tom's own prospects were canvassed and highly approved of by both  Mr, and Mrs Newcome.    Tom already pictured himself settled down in his country practice,  enjoying himself, doing good to others, and laying by a comfortable  competency for future years.  On the whole, he felt, as he quitted the  hospitable roof of his genial friends, that he had rarely spent a more  pleasant or profitable evening.    People were thronging out of the theatre as he returned, and he could  not resist the desire to stand and watch them; for a little.  He  wondered what they had seen, and whether those he saw had waited for the  \"farce,\" or was that still going on?--and he wondered if any people ever  went into a theatre at so late an hour as eleven.    Ah, Tom! he did not go in that night, or the next, but he was getting  himself ready for the first step.    Reader, do not mistake Tom's weakness and folly.  He was not trying to  persuade himself this place was a good one for him to enter; he was not  thoughtlessly going in to discover too late that he had better have  stayed out.  No, Tom--rightly or wrongly--had made up his own mind that  this theatre was a bad place, and _yet_ he had a desire to enter in!        CHAPTER TWELVE.    HOW TOM DRIFT BEGINS TO GO DOWNHILL.    Time went on, and Tom Drift advanced inch by inch nearer the brink.  He  slipped, not without many an effort to recover himself, many a pang of  self-reproach, many a vague hope of deliverance.    \"Be good to Tom Drift!\" was ever ringing in my ears.  But what could I  do?  He often neglected me for days.  All I could do was to watch and  tremble for what was coming.    You who are so ready to call Tom a fool, and hug yourselves that you  have more strength of character and resolution than he had, try to  realise what were his perils and what were his temptations at that time,  before you pass judgment.    The dulness of those lodgings in Grime Street was often almost  unbearable.  When his work was done, and Tom looked out of the window  and saw nothing but carts and cabs and tradesmen, and the dismal houses  opposite, what wonder if he sometimes felt miserable?  When he heard  nothing but pattering footsteps down the pavement, the rumble of wheels  and the street cries under his window, what wonder if he felt lonely and  friendless?  No footsteps stopped at _his_ door, no friendly face  lightened _his_ dull study, no cheery laughter brought music to _his_  life.  What wonder, I say, if he moped and felt discontented?    What wonder if his thoughts wandered to scenes and places that  contrasted forcibly with his dead-alive occupation?  What wonder if he  hankered after a \"little excitement,\" to break the monotony of lectures,  hard reading, and stupid evenings?    \"Ah,\" I hear you say, \"there are plenty of things he might have done.  It was his own fault if he was dull in London.  I would have gone to the  museums, the libraries, the concerts, the parks, the river, the picture  galleries, and other harmless and delightful places of amusement.  Why,  I could not be dull in London if I tried.  Tom Drift was an idiot.\"    My dear friend, what a pity Tom Drift had not the advantage of your  acquaintance when he was in London!  But he had not.  He had no friends,  as I have said, except the Newcomes, whom he only visited occasionally,  and as a matter chiefly of duty, and his anxiety to keep right at first  had led him to reject and fight shy of friendships with his fellow-  students.  Doubtless it was his own fault to a large extent that he  allowed himself to get into this dull, dissatisfied condition.  If he  had had a healthy mind like you, friend, it would not have happened.  But instead of utterly scouting him as an idiot, rather thank God you  have been spared all his weaknesses and all his temptations.    Was Tom never to learn that there was a way--\"The Way, the Truth, and  the Life\"--better than any he had yet tried, which would lead him  straight through the tangled mazes of his London life?  Was he never to  discover that Friend, truer than all earthly friends, at Whose side he  might brave each trial and overcome each temptation?    Poor Tom! he walked in a way of his own? and trusted in no one better  than himself; and that was why he fell.    As I have said, he did not fall without an effort.  I have known him one  day buy a bad, trashy book, and the same evening, in a fit of  repentance--for God's Spirit wonderfully strives with men--take and burn  it to ashes in his grate.  But I have also known him to buy the same  book again the next day.  I have known him to walk a mile out of his way  to avoid a place of temptation; and yet, before his walk was done, find  himself, after all, under the glare of its lamps.  The moth hovers in  wide circles round the candle before it ventures its wings in the flame.  And so it was with Tom; but the catastrophe came at last.    One evening about three weeks before the time fixed for the Easter trip  with Charlie, Tom felt in tolerably dull.  He had been neglecting his  work during several days for novels of the lowest and most sensational  type.  Over these he had dawdled till his brain had become muddled with  their unreal incidents and impure suggestions, and now that they were  done he felt fit for nothing.  He could not settle down to work, he had  no friends to turn to, and so he put his hat on his head and sallied out  into the streets to seek there the variety he could not find indoors.    As usual, his steps led him to the low theatre about which he was so  curious, and of which he heard so much from his fellow-students.  It was  half-past seven, and people were beginning to crowd round the door,  waiting for it to open.  Tom, standing on the other side of the  pavement, watched them with a painful fascination.    \"Shall I go for once?\" he asked himself.  Then he strolled up to the  playbill and read it.    As he was doing so some one slapped him on the shoulder, and, turning  quickly round, he found himself face to face with his old acquaintance  Gus Burke and another youth.    Gus, who was still small of stature, though fully nineteen years of age,  was arrayed in the height of the fashion.  As Tom regarded him he felt  his own coat become more shabby and his hat older, and he wished he had  brought his dogskin gloves and cane.  Gus was smoking, too, a cigarette,  and very distinguished and gentlemanly Tom thought it looked.  He felt,  as he regarded his brilliant and unexpected acquaintance, that he was  rather glad those people who were standing at the theatre door should  see him accosted in so familiar a way by such a hero.  And Gus's friend  was no less imposing--more so, indeed, for he wore an eyeglass.    Tom was so astonished at this unexpected meeting that he had noticed all  this long before he found words to return his old schoolfellow's  salutation.    Gus, however, relieved him of his embarrassment.    \"Tom Drift, upon my honour!  How are you, old horse, and how's your  mother?  Who'd have thought of running up against you like this?\"    Tom tried to look as much at his ease as he could as he replied,--    \"Why, Gus, old man, where _did_ you spring from?  I didn't know you were  in London.\"    \"Ain't I, though!\" replied Gus, tapping the end of his cigarette on his  cane.  \"But what are you up to, Tom?--you're not going in here, are  you?\" pointing over his shoulder to the theatre.    \"Well, no,\" said Tom; \"that is,\" added he, with as much of a swagger as  he could assume on the spur of the moment, \"I had been half thinking of  just seeing what it was like.  Some of our fellows, you know, fancy the  place.\"    How suddenly and easily he was, under the eyes of these two \"swells,\"  casting off the few slender cords that still held him moored to the  shore.    \"Oh, don't go"]]]
