[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24407"],[0,"The Italian Cook Book (#17)"],[1,"in powder, four ounces.    Eight yolks of eggs.    A taste of vanilla.    Mix everything together as you would do for a cream and put on the fire  in a saucepan, continually stirring with a ladle. When the mixture has  become hard keep it a few moments more on the fire and then pour it in a  plate to make it about half an inch thick and cut it into diamonds when  it is cold. Put these diamonds one over the other with symmetry in a  baking tin or in a fireproof glass plate, with some little pieces of  butter in between and brown them a little in the oven. Serve hot.      208    SABAYON    (Zabaione)      Yolks of three eggs.    Granulated sugar, two ounces.    Marsala or sherry wine, five tablespoonfuls.    A dash of cinnamon.    First stir with the ladle the yolks and the sugar until they become  almost white, then add the wine. When ready to serve, place the saucepan  in another one containing hot water and beat until the sugar is melted  and the egg begins to thicken.      SYRUPS    (Sciroppi)    The syrups of acidulated fruits, diluted with ice water are refreshing  and pleasant beverages, greatly appreciated during the summer months. It  is well, however, not to drink them until the digestion is completed,  because they may disturb it, on account of the sugar that they contain.      209    RED CURRANT OR GOOSEBERRY SYRUP    (Sciroppo di ribes)    Remove the stems from the bunches of gooseberry and place them in an  earthen vase, to be kept in a cool place. When it has begun to ferment  (which may happen after three or four days) sink the surface film and  stir with a ladle twice a day, continuing this operation until it has  stopped raising. Then put in a cheese cloth, letting the juice come out  through pressing with the hands or in a machine. Pass the juice through  a filter, two or three times if necessary, until you obtain a limpid  liquid. Then put it on the fire and when it begins to boil pour in it  granulated sugar and citric acid in the following proportions:      Liquid, six pounds.    Sugar, eight pounds.    Citric acid, one ounce.    That is to say for each =three= parts of the liquid, add =four= parts of  sugar, and =one= ounce of citric acid for =eight= pounds of sugar mixed  with =six= pounds of liquid.    Stir continually with the ladle so that the sugar does not stick to the  bottom, taste it to add some more citric acid if you judge it necessary,  then let it cool and place in bottles to be sealed.    When a beverage is to be prepared pour in a tumbler less than half an  inch of syrup for a tumblerful of ice water.      210    RASPBERRY SYRUP    (Sciroppo di lampone)    This is prepared like the other explained above but, since this fruit  contains less gluten than the gooseberry the period of fermentation will  be briefer. The large quantity of sugar used in these syrups is  necessary for their conservation and the citric acid is used to correct  the excessive sweetness.      211    LEMON SYRUP    (Sciroppo di limone)      Three big lemons.    One and a half pound of sugar.    A tumbler of water.    Skin the lemons, removing the internal pulp without squeezing it and  taking off all seeds.    Put the water on the fire with the skin of one of the lemons cut in a  thin ribbon like strip with a small knife. When the water is near  boiling put in the sugar then remove the lemon skin and immerse the pulp  of the three lemons. Boil until the syrup is condensed and cooked right,  which is known by the pearls that it makes boiling and the color of  white wine that it acquires. Preserve in a bottle, and when needed,  dilute in a tumbler of ice water. A small quantity will make a  delightful beverage.      212    HARD BLACK-BERRY SYRUP    (Sciroppo di amarena)    Use hard but ripe black berries. They must be of the sour kind but, as  said, they must not be unripe. Remove the stems and put the berries into  a vase with a good piece of whole cinnamon. The fermentation will happen  after 48 hours and as soon as the berries begin to rise, stir them from  time to time. Then press them to extract the juice, with a pressing  machine if you have one, or with your hands, squeezing them a few at a  time in cheese cloth.--When the liquid has rested for a while, filter it  until it becomes quite clear. When it has been depurated, put it on the  fire in the following proportion and with the piece of cinnamon that was  already immersed in the cherries: Twelve pounds of liquid to sixteen  pounds of sugar and two ounces of citric acid, or three parts of liquid  to four of sugar and the citric acid as in the above proportion.    Before putting in the sugar and the citric acid wait until the liquid is  quite hot, just before boiling. Then stir continually. The boiling must  be brief, four or five minutes are sufficient to incorporate the sugar  in the liquid.    When removing the syrup from the fire, put it in an earthen vase and  bottle when quite cold. Cork the bottles well and keep in a cool place.      213    ORGEAT    (Orzata)      Sweet almonds with 10 or 12 bitter ones, seven ounces.    Water, one and half pounds.    Granulated sugar, two pounds.    Skin the almonds and grind them very fine, or better pound them in a  mortar, moistening from time to time with orange flower water, of which  you will use about two tablespoonfuls.    When the almonds have been reduced to a paste, dissolve the latter in  one third of the water and filter the juice through a cheese cloth,  squeezing hard. Put the paste, back in the grinder or in the mortar,  grind or pound again, then filter again with another third of the water.  Repeat the same operation for a third time, then put on the fire the  liquid so obtained and just before boiling put the sugar, mix, stir and  boil for about twenty minutes. Let it cool, then bottle and keep in a  cool place. The orgeat does not ferment and the thick liquid may be  diluted in water, half an inch for a whole tumbler of iced water.          PRESERVES    214    APRICOT MARMALADE    (Conserva di albicocche)    Use good and ripe apricots. It is a mistake to believe that jam or  marmalade can be obtained with any kind of fruit. Take off the stones,  put them on the fire without water and while they boil, stir with a  ladle to reduce them to pulp. When they have boiled for about half an  hour, rub them through a sieve to separate the pulp of the fruit from  the skins that are to be thrown away, then put them back on the fire  with granulated sugar in the proportion of eight tenths, that is to say  eight pounds of sugar for ten pounds of apricot pulp. Stir often with  the ladle until the mixture acquires the firmness of marmalade, which  will be known by putting from time to time a teaspoonful in a plate and  seeing that it flows slowly.    When ready, remove from the fire, let it cool, and then put in vases  well covered and with a film of paraffine or tissue paper dipped in  alcohol, so that the air may not pass in.      215    PRESERVE OF QUINCE    (Conserva di cotogne soda)    The ingredients are quinces, peeled and with the core removed, and  granulated sugar, in the proportion of eight tenths of quinces to five  tenths of sugar, or a little more than one and a half quinces for one  part of sugar.    Dissolve the sugar on the fire with half a glass of water, boil a  little, then remove from the fire and put aside.    Cut the quinces--peeled and coreless--in very thin slices and put them  on the fire with a glass of water, supposing the quantity to be about  two pounds. Keep covered, but stir once in a while with the ladle,  trying to break the slices and reduce them to a paste. When the quinces  are made tender through cooking, pour in the thick syrup of sugar  already prepared, mix and stir and let the mixture boil with the cover  removed until the preserve is ready, which will be known when it begins  to fall like shreds when taken up with the ladle.    Let it cool and put in well covered jars.          ICES    (Gelati)    Although it is in America that there is a greater consumption of ice  cream, it is in Italy that it was first made, and in various European  capitals it is the Italian =gelatiere= who prepares the frozen delicacy.  A few Italian recipes of =gelati= will then be acceptable, we believe,  as a conclusion to this little work.      216    BISCUIT    (Pezzo in gelo)    Make a cream with:      Water, five ounces.    Sugar, two ounces.    The yolks of four eggs.    A taste of vanilla.    Put it on the fire stirring continually and when it begins to stick to  the ladle remove from the fire and whip to a stiff froth. Then mix about  five ounces of ordinary whipped cream, put in a mold and pack in salt  and ice.    Keep in ice for about three hours.    This dose will be sufficient for seven or eight persons.      217    LEMON ICE    (Gelato di limone)      Granulated sugar, 3/4 lb.    Water, a pint.    Lemons, three (good sized).    Boil the sugar in the water, with some little pieces of lemon peel, for  about ten minutes, in an uncovered kettle. When this syrup is cold,  squeeze the lemons one at the time, tasting the mixture to regulate the  degree of acidity. Then strain and put in the freezer packed with salt  and ice.      218    STRAWBERRY ICE    (Gelato di fragola)      Ripe strawberries, 3/4 lb.    Granulated sugar, 3/4 lb.    Water, one pint.    A big lemon.    An orange.    Boil the sugar in the water for ten minutes in an uncovered kettle. Rub  through a sieve the strawberries and the juice of the lemon and the  orange: add the syrup after straining, mix everything and pour the  mixture in the freezer.      219    ORANGE ICE    (Gelato di aranci)      Four big oranges.    One lemon.    One pint of water.    Sugar, 3/4 lb.    Squeeze the oranges and the lemon and strain the juice.    Boil the sugar in the water for ten minutes, put in the juice when cold,  strain again and put in the freezer.      220    PISTACHE ICE CREAM    (Gelato di pistacchi)      Milk, one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#17)"],[1," entire destruction. Other causes, however, have probably  contributed to the same end. It will be remembered that these trees  have greatly suffered, in past times, from the ravages of canker-worms.  Moreover, the impenetrable state of the surface soil, the exhausted  condition of the subsoil, and the deprivation of all benefit from the  decomposition of accumulated leaves, which, in a state of nature, the  trees would have enjoyed, but which a regard for neatness has  industriously removed, have doubtless had no small influence in  diminishing the vigor of the trees, and thus made them fall  unresistingly a prey to insect devourers. The plan of this work  precludes a more full consideration of these and other topics connected  with the growth and decay of these trees; and I can only add, that it  may be prudent to cut down and burn all that are much infested by the  borers.\"    [Illustration: 101. Elm Tree Beetle.]    The Three-toothed Compsidea (Fig. 101), is a rather flat-bodied, dark  brown beetle, with a rusty red curved line behind the eyes, two stripes  on the thorax, and a three-toothed stripe on the outer edge of each wing  cover. It is about one-half an inch in length.    [Illustration: 102. Elm Tree Borer.]    The larva (Fig. 102) is white, subcylindrical, a little flattened, with  the lateral fold of the body rather prominent; the end of the body is  flattened, obtuse, and nearly as wide at the end as at the first  abdominal ring. The head is one-half as wide as the prothoracic ring,  being rather large. The prothoracic ring, or segment just behind the  head, is transversely oblong, being twice as broad as long; there is a  pale dorsal corneous transversely oblong shield, being about two-thirds  as long as wide, and nearly as long as the four succeeding segments;  this plate is smooth, except on the posterior half, which is rough, with  the front edge irregular and not extending far down the sides. Fine  hairs arise from the front edge and side of the plate, and similar hairs  are scattered over the body and especially around the end. On the upper  side of each segment is a transversely oblong ovate roughened area, with  the front edge slightly convex, and the hinder slightly arcuate. On the  under side of each segment are similar rough horny plates, but arcuate  in front, with the hinder edge straight.    It differs from the larva of the Linden tree borer (Saperda vestita) in  the body being shorter, broader, more hairy, with the tip of the abdomen  flatter and more hairy. The prothoracic segment is broader and flatter,  and the rough portion of the dorsal plates is larger and less  tranversely ovate. The structure of the head shows that its generic  distinctness from Saperda is well founded, as the head is smaller and  flatter, the clypeus being twice as large, and the labrum broad and  short, while in S. vestita it is longer than broad. The mandibles are  much longer and slenderer, and the antennae are much smaller than in S.  vestita.    [Illustration: 103. Linden Tree Beetle.]    [Illustration: 104. Linden Tree Borer.]    The Linden tree borer (Fig. 103) is a greenish snuff-yellow beetle, with  six black spots near the middle of the back; and it is about  eight-tenths of an inch in length, though often smaller. The beetles,  according to Dr. Paul Swift, as quoted by Dr. Harris, were found (in  Philadelphia) upon the small branches and leaves on the 28th day of May,  and it is said that they come out as early as the first of the month,  and continue to make their way through the back of the trunk and large  branches during the whole of the warm season. They immediately fly into  the top of the tree, and there feed upon the epidermis of the tender  twigs, and the petioles of the leaves, often wholly denuding the latter,  and causing the leaves to fall. They deposit their eggs, two or three in  a place, upon the trunk or branches especially about the forks, making  slight incisions or punctures for their reception with their strong  jaws. As many as ninety eggs have been taken from a single beetle. The  grubs (Fig. 104, _e_; _a_, enlarged view of the head seen from above;  _b_, the under view of the same: _c_, side view, and _d_, two rings of  the body enlarged), hatched from these eggs, undermine the bark to the  extent of six or eight inches, in sinuous channels, or penetrate the  solid wood an equal distance. It is supposed that three years are  required to mature the insect. Various expedients have been tried to  arrest their course, but without effect. A stream, thrown into the tops  of trees from the hydrant, is often used with good success to dislodge  other insects; but the borer-beetles, when thus disturbed, take wing and  hover over the trees till all is quiet, and then alight and go to work  again. The trunks and branches of some of the trees have been washed  over with various preparations without benefit. Boring the trunk near  the ground and putting in sulphur and other drugs, and plugging, have  been tried with as little effect.    [Illustration: 105. Poplar Tree Borer.]    The city of Philadelphia has suffered grievously from this borer.    [Illustration: 106. Broad-necked Prionus.]    Dr. Swift remarks, in 1844, that \"the trees in Washington and  Independence Squares were first observed to have been attacked about  seven years ago. Within two years it has been found necessary to cut  down forty-seven European lindens in the former square alone, where  there now remain only a few American lindens, and these a good deal  eaten.\" In New England this beetle should be looked for during the first  half of June.    [Illustration: 107. Larva of the Plain Saperda.]    The Poplar tree is infested by an other species of Saperda (S.  calcarata). This is a much larger beetle than those above mentioned,  being an inch or a little more in length. It is grey, irregularly  striped, with ochre, and the wing-covers end in a sharp point. The grub  (Fig. 105 _a_; _b_, top view of the head; _e_, under side) is about two  inches long and whitish yellow. It has, with that of the Broad-necked  Prionus (P. laticollis of Drury, Fig. 106, adult and pupa), as Harris  states, \"almost entirely destroyed the Lombardy poplar in this vicinity\"  (Boston). It bores in the trunks, and the beetle flies by night in  August and September. We also figure the larva of another borer (Fig.  107 _c_; _a_, top view of the head; _b_, under side; _e_, dorsal view of  an abdominal segment; _d_, end of the body, showing its peculiar form),  the Saperda inornata of Say, the beetle of which is black, with ash gray  hairs, and without spines on the wing-covers. It is much smaller than  any of the foregoing species, being nine-twentieths of an inch in  length. Its habits are not known. We also figure the Locust and Hickory  borer (Fig. 108; _a_, larva; _b_, pupa), which has swept off the locust  tree from New England. The beautiful yellow banded beetles are very  abundant on the flowers of the golden rod in September.    [Illustration: 108. Locust Borer.]    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 4: The External and Internal Parasites of Man and Domestic  Animals. By Prof. A. E. Verrill, 1870.

CERTAIN PARASITIC INSECTS.      The subject of our discourse is not only a disagreeable but too often a  painful one. Not only is the mere mention of the creature's name of  which we are to speak tabooed and avoided by the refined and polite, but  the creature itself has become extinct and banished from the society of  the good and respectable. Indeed under such happy auspices do a large  proportion of the civilized world now live that their knowledge of the  habits and form of a louse may be represented by a blank. Not so with  some of their great-great-grandfathers and grandmothers, if history,  sacred and profane, poetry,[5] and the annals of literature testify  aright; for it is comparatively a recent fact in history that the louse  has awakened to find himself an outcast and an alien. Among savage  nations of all climes, some of which have been dignified with the apt,  though high sounding name of Phthiriophagi, and among the Chinese and  other semi-civilized peoples, these lords of the soil still flourish  with a luxuriance and rankness of growth that never diminishes, so that  we may say without exaggeration that certain mental traits and fleshly  appetites induced by their consumption as an article of food may have  been created, while a separate niche in our anthropological museums is  reserved for the instruments of warfare, both offensive and defensive,  used by their phthiriophagous hunters. Then have we not in the very  centres of civilization the poor and degraded, which are most faithfully  attended lay these revolting satellites!    But bantering aside, there is no more engaging subject to the naturalist  than that of animal parasites. Consider the great proportion of animals  that gain their livelihood by stealing that of others. While a large  proportion of plants are more or less parasitic, they gain, thereby in  interest to the botanist, and many of them are eagerly sought as the  choicest ornaments of our conservatories. Not so with their zooelogical  confreres. All that is repulsive and uncanny is associated with them,  and those who study them, though perhaps among the keenest intellects  and most industrious observers, speak of them without the limits of  their own circle in subdued whispers or under a protest, and their works  fall under the eyes of the scantiest few. But the study of animal  parasites has opened up new fields of research, all bearing most  intimately on those two questions that ever incite the naturalist to the  most laborious and untiring diligence--what is life and its origin?
