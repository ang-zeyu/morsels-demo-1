In  consequence of this failure the whole Boer force was enabled to swarm  from all directions towards the isolated column. Firing fierce and  incessant, exhausted the already worn-out Irish Fusiliers, while the  advanced companies of the Gloucesters were severely mauled by the  Martini bullets of the enemy. The hill was now completely surrounded,  the ammunition expended; still Colonel Carleton had no idea of giving  in. The bayonet was left, and by the bayonet he meant to stand or fall.  Suddenly a wounded officer ordered the white flag to be raised. It was  then hoisted, but uncertainty prevailed as to the authority for the  exhibition of the flag, and some of our men still continued to fire.  However, the mischief was done, and the surrender was merely a matter of  moments.    The most vivid account of the disaster, from an outsider's point of  view, was given by the _Times_ special correspondent at Ladysmith. He  wrote:--         \"This column, consisting of six companies of the Royal Irish       Fusiliers, four and a half companies of the Gloucestershire       Regiment, and No. 10 Mountain Battery, left camp on Sunday       night at 10.30, with the object of occupying a position from       which it would be able to operate upon the right of the Boer       position on Pepworth Hill. The column was guided by Major Adye,       of the Field Intelligence, and a staff of the headquarters       guides. Their destination was Nicholson's Nek, a position       which, when reconnoitred from this side, appeared to possess       the necessary tactical advantages for a detached force.       Nicholson's Nek lies about four miles up Bell's Spruit, a donga       due north of Ladysmith. The men blundered along in the       darkness, the Irish Fusiliers leading, the battery in the       centre, the rear being brought up by the Gloucestershire       Regiment. There seems no doubt upon one point, and that is, the       enemy were aware of this part of the movement from the       beginning. Probably they were aware of the whole of the plans       for Monday, for in Ladysmith it was impossible to say who was a       Boer agent and who not. However that may be, it is certain that       the enemy were on the flanks of the column all night, one of       the survivors positively stating that he constantly heard the       snapping of breeches, and once the peculiar noise which a rifle       makes at night when it is dropped.         \"Two hours before daybreak, while the column was in enclosed       country, either a shot was fired or a boulder rolled into the       battery in column of route. The mules stampeded, and easily       broke away from their half-asleep drivers. They came back upon       the Gloucestershire Regiment, the advance party of whom fired       into the mass, believing in the darkness that it was an attack.       This added to the chaos; the ranks were broken by the frenzied       animals, and they dashed through the ranks of the rearguard,       carrying the first and second reserve ammunition animals with       them. It became a hopeless panic; the animals, wild with the       shouting and the turmoil, tore down the nullah into the       darkness, and the last that was heard of them was the sound of       ammunition-boxes and panniers as they were splintered against       the boulders. The hubbub of those few minutes was sufficient to       have alarmed the enemy. By a strenuous effort the officers       succeeded in getting the men again under control, and when       daylight came they seized the first position which presented       itself, and which was about two miles short of the original       goal. They were forced to take advantage of the first kopje, as       Boer scouts were all round them, and the day was ushered in       with desultory firing. It was a sorry position which they had       chosen, and the men were in a sorrier plight. All their reserve       ammunition was gone, and though they had saved pieces of the       screw-guns, they were not able with these pieces to patch up a       single mounting.         \"The position itself was a flat kopje commanded on the south by       a self-contained ridge. To the east was another kopje, which       commanded the top of the position at about 500 yards. On the       west were two similar spurs, also commanding the position at       short ranges. The summit of the kopje was a plateau, all the       sides being gradual slopes except the eastern, which was       almost sheer, this latter being the side from which access had       been gained. From below it appeared a defensible position, but       when once the top was reached it was evident that it was       commanded from all sides. The men busied themselves attempting       to build breastworks. The Gloucestershire companies, with their       Maxim gun, were given the northern face to hold, two companies       being detached on to a self-contained ridge of the position       which lay on the south side. The Irish Fusiliers had the       precipitous flank to defend.         \"From earliest daybreak Boer scouts were reconnoitring, and       about eight o'clock mounted Boers could be seen galloping in       small groups to the cover at the reverse of the hill on the       west. Later two strong parties of mounted men took position on       the far side of the two hills commanding the kopje from the       west. About nine o'clock these two parties had crowned the       hills and opened a heavy fire at short ranges right down upon       the plateau. Our men made a plucky attempt to return this fire,       but it was impossible; they were under a cross-fire from two       directions, flank and rear. The two companies of Gloucesters       holding the self-contained ridge were driven from their       shelter, and as they crossed the open on the lower plateau were       terribly mauled, the men falling in groups. The Boers on the       west had not yet declared themselves, but about 200 marksmen       climbed to the position which the two companies of the       Gloucesters had just vacated. These men absolutely raked the       plateau, and it was then that the men were ordered to take       cover on the steep reverse of the kopje. As soon as the enemy       realised this move, the men on the western hill teemed on to       the summit and opened upon our men as they lay on the slope.       They were absolutely hemmed in, and what had commenced as a       skirmish seemed about to become a butchery. The grim order was       passed round--'Faugh-a-Ballaghs, fix your bayonets and die like       men!' There was the clatter of steel, the moment of suspense,       and then the 'Cease fire' sounded. Again and again it sounded,       but the Irish Fusiliers were loth to accept the call, and       continued firing for many minutes. Then it was unconditional       surrender and the men laid down their arms.\"    [Illustration: GENERAL JOUBERT.    Photo by Elliott & Fry, London.]    An officer of the Gloucestershire Regiment described the affair thus:--                                         \"HOSPITAL, WYNBERG, 9/11/1899.         \"We were ordered out with six companies of Royal Irish       Fusiliers and No. 10 Mountain Battery, Royal Artillery, to make       a night march through the Boer lines and hold a hill behind       their right flank till the rest of the troops took us off,       which they expected to do about 11 A.M. As it turned out, they       were not able to do this, but they did keep the Boer guns       employed, luckily for us. We started off at 8.30 P.M., and got       to the foot of our hill about 2 A.M. The Royal Irish Fusiliers       were in front, then the battery and S.A.A. mules, and last       ourselves. The Royal Irish Fusiliers had got part way up the       hill--a very steep one--when three mounted Boers galloped down       amid clouds of dust, rolling stones, &c. They started off the       battery and S.A.A. mules, the Boers firing as they passed. The       mules cut right through the regiment, and all was chaos for a       time.         \"It was pitch dark, and the noise of the mules and the loads       and the stores falling about was enough to put any one off.       Several men were hurt, some got in next day, some are       missing.--Part of Stayner's, Fyffe's, and my company were cut       off from the rest altogether, and when we got them in some sort       of order, we had quite lost the rest of the column. The orders       were to push on, no matter what happened, and every one left to       look out for himself. After some time trying to find the       path, we came across a straggler, who told us which way the       regiment had gone, and eventually we found them on the top of a       hill. We were ordered, as soon as we got on the hill, to put up       sangars, which we worked at by the light of a very small moon       till daylight. Then the Boers began on us all round, not very       many, till about half-past eight. From then till 2.30 the fire       was hot, and hottest at 2.30, when our ammunition being almost       down and the fire devilish from all sides, we had to give in.         \"I got a grazing shot on my left hand and a bullet in my right       forearm early (about 8.30 A.M., and two more grazers--right       thigh and left elbow)--later, finally, a bullet from behind       through the right shoulder about a quarter of an hour before       the end. I don't know who gave the order to 'Cease fire.' The       firing could not have gone on five minutes more on our side for       want of ammunition, and the Boer fire was tremendous from all       round. It was like 'magazine independent' at the end of       field-firing. The astonishing thing is so few were hit. If we       had had our guns and ammunition, I think we could have held on       until night and then got off, but there were 1200 of them, they       said, to our 800, not counting gunners,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26323"],[0,"The Suffrage Cook Book (#17)"],[1,"casserole, sprinkle with  1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese, and slip into each an egg.

Strawberry Short Cake a la Mode              1 cup flour            1/2 teaspoon Baking powder            1/4 teaspoon salt            1 heaping tablespoon of butter    Sift the dry ingredients together and work in the butter. Mix with  enough milk to make a stiff dough which can be rolled as thin as a  wafer.    Put one thin layer on a pie-pan and butter lightly; lay another layer on  first. Bake eight minutes in a moderate oven.    When cold cut in pieces and split each piece. Place a large tablespoon  of crushed, sweetened strawberries between the layers, add the top  layer, add more berries, and last of all, a heaping tablespoon of ice  cream or frozen custard.      Frozen Custard    (for above Short Cake)    To 1 pint of milk add 1/2 pint of cream. Scald. Have ready 1 egg, well  beaten, 1 scant cup of granulated sugar, and one level tablespoon of  cornstarch.    Add this mixture to the milk and cream as soon as they come to a boil.  Stir and set aside to cool. When cold, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and  freeze.      Stewed Apples    Cut apples in quarters and immediately put in saucepan and pour over  them boiling water just to cover.    Put on lid and boil quickly until tender. Sprinkle sugar over them to  taste. But never stir the apples at any time. When sugar is on leave the  lid off, let cook about five minutes longer, never stirring.    Ready to serve, hot or cold.      Cinnamon Apples              3 cups sugar--pinch salt            2 1/2 cups water            1 cup cinnamon drops            8 apples    Make a syrup of water and sugar. Put in cinnamon drops. Pare and core  apples. Place in syrup and boil until tender, do not allow to break.    Take out when tender and place in a dish or if you wish in individual  dishes. Pour over syrup, and allow to cool. When cold pour whipped cream  on top of each and a cherry on top of cream.      Fire Apples    Select bright red apples, cut off the tops and with a knife remove the  meat, leaving only sufficient wall to hold apple in shape. Make a  filling of the following:    To six apples allow about twelve tablespoons of very dry cooked rice,  six tablespoons cracker crumbs, six tablespoons chopped apples, six  tablespoons sugar, six tablespoons seeded raisins, six tablespoons  chopped almonds.    Whip one egg thoroughly, place in a cup and fill the cup with milk; stir  well and place in a double boiler, adding one-half teaspoon butter,  grated rind and juice of one-half lemon and a dash of nutmeg. Cook until  it thickens, cool, then mix it into the filling, being careful not to  get it too soft. Mold lightly with the fingers and fill the apples,  sprinkle with sugar, add a cupful of water and bake in a moderate oven.  Serve with whipped cream or custard sauce.      Candied Cranberry Recipe              1 quart berries            2 cups sugar            1 1/2 large cups of hot or cold water            pinch of soda    Wash and make a little slit in each berry. For each quart of berries put  one and a half large cups of hot or cold water in kettle. Then the  berries, then spread 2 cups sugar over them, also a pinch of soda. Keep  covered closely all the time, do not stir or lift lid until perfectly  cold. From the moment it begins to boil count five minutes--no more--to  cook them.    If you remove the lid the lovely gloss will be lost.      Apple Rice    1 cup of rice boiled in water with a piece of butter and a little salt  until half done. Then add six apples cut in pieces. Cook together until  both rice and apples are well done. Add sugar to taste. When ready to  serve pour over melted butter browned. Serve with sugar and cinnamon.                                                  MRS. RAYMOND ROBINS.      Jelly Whip    Dissolve one package of gelatin in a cupful of cold water. Add to that  two cupfuls of sugar and one quart of boiling water. Divide the mixture  into three parts, in one of which place marshmallows and white grapes.  In the second one put pineapple and oranges and in the third nuts. Fill  individual glasses with different mixtures and serve them with whipped  cream. Decorate with preserved cherries, candied orange peel and nuts.      Pineapple Parfait    Pare and shred a ripe pineapple, add one cup of sugar and let stand for  several hours. Drain off one cup of the juice, boil it with  three-quarters of a cup of sugar for 10 minutes. Add slowly to well  beaten yolks of four eggs, and cook in a double boiler, stirring all the  time, until the mixture will coat the spoon. Remove from the fire and  beat until cold. Then add two tablespoons of lemon juice and two cups of  cream whipped to a stiff froth.    Pack in a mold, cover tightly and surround with ice and salt for four  hours.      Rice              3/4 cup of rice washed 7 times            1/2 cup currants            1 1/4 cups milk            Yolk of 1 egg            2 1/2 tablespoons sugar            1 small piece lemon rind    Boil rice in a large quantity of boiling water for 20 minutes; drain and  add milk, sugar, lemon rind, currants. Let cook slowly for 15 minutes  and remove from fire; beat the yolk of an egg in a little milk and stir  in the rice.    Do not set back on the fire. Serve cold.      Pittsburgh Sherbet    Take a cupful of the syrup from a jar of raspberry preserves and the  same amount of juice from a can of pineapple; add two tablespoons of  lemon juice and a syrup made by boiling together a pint of water and a  cupful of sugar. When cold add four tablespoons of orange juice and  freeze. When stiff, open the freezer and add the white of an egg, beaten  stiff with a teaspoon of powdered sugar.      Lemon Sherbet              1 quart milk            2 cups sugar            juice 3 lemons    Dissolve sugar in milk, place in freezer. Add lemon juice after freezer  has been packed. Add juice rapidly and with violent stirring, then  immediately place in dasher and turn the crank until frozen.      Fruit Cocktails    Peel and cut one orange and one grapefruit into small pieces, removing  all seeds and white bits of skin, add two sliced bananas, a tablespoon  of chopped or grated pineapple, sweeten to taste, and mix with the juice  from a can of pineapple. Stand in a very cold place, or put in the ice  cream freezer and partially freeze, serve in small glasses and ornament  with maraschino cherries. Reserve the remaining pineapple for a luncheon  dish.      Synthetic Quince    An Accidental Discovery    I put too much water with my rhubarb and had a whole dishful of  beautiful pink juice left over, about a quart. In this I cooked some  apples, quartered, and stewed till soft, and just as an experiment added  a saucerful of strawberries--also \"left over.\"    The result, being served, looked and tasted exactly like quince, except  that the apple was a little softer.

To this add a cupful of boiling water and a tablespoon of  sugar.    Place in a saucepan of granite ware and add one quart of unfermented  grape juice, four whole cloves and a pinch of powdered mace. Bring  slowly to the boiling point and simmer for ten minutes.    Boil together one cupful of sugar and two tablespoons of water without  stirring until it spins a thread.    Pour this gradually upon the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs. Add the  boiling grape juice, dust lightly with grated nutmeg and serve  immediately.      "]]]
