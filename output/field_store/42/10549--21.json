Therefore, on the following day, the whole court was filled with  nobles, soldiers, and attendants of all kinds. All the directions for  the journey had been given by the old man who had taken service with  the emperor's son-in-law; he said that he was the Pea Emperor's  steward, and all praised his energy, dignity, and industry.    The emperor was in high spirits and set out with the empress, the Pea  Emperor, and his bride, for his son-in-law's possessions. The old  servant went before and had every thing in good order. But the poor  Pea Emperor was as pale and dejected as if somebody had showered him  with boiling water. He was thinking of the riddles and how he could  guess them.    They drove and drove till they reached the fields. Here was a  beautiful meadow, beyond it a grove like the Garden of Paradise. When  the overseer of the fields saw them, he came up cap in hand.    \"To whom do these estates belong, my friend?\" asked the emperor.    \"To the Pea Emperor,\" replied the man.    The emperor grew fat with joy, for he now believed that his son-in-law  really was no beggar. They drove on some distance further and met  numerous flocks and herds of all sorts of animals; the emperor asked  one keeper after another to whom they belonged, and all replied: \"To  the Pea Emperor.\"    But when they reached the palace of the nine dragons the emperor  marveled at its magnificence. Every thing was in order. They were  received at the gate by a band of musicians, who played the most  beautiful tunes ever heard. The interior of the palace was adorned  with real gems. A magnificent banquet was hastily prepared, and they  drank the finest wine.    After the emperor had wished his son-in-law every happiness, he  returned to his own home greatly delighted with the riches he had  seen. But the Pea Emperor was almost dead with anxiety.    Evening came. The old servant said to his master:    \"Master, what you have seen of me since I entered your service must  have convinced you of my fidelity. Now I assure you that I can help  you still more.\"    \"Are you telling the truth?\" asked the Pea Emperor.    \"Do not doubt me for an instant, master! And I ask one thing besides:  let me spend the night in some corner of the chamber where you are  sleeping, even if it is behind the door. Moreover, I advise you not to  answer a single word, no matter who calls you by name or how great a  noise is made.\"    \"Be it so!\" said the Pea Emperor. And so it was.    After they had lain down and put out the light, they heard a dull,  rumbling noise like an approaching thunder storm. Then a hoarse, rough  voice said:    \"Pea Emperor, Pea Emperor!\"    \"What do you want?\" replied the old man.    \"I'm not calling you,\" it replied, \"I'm calling the Pea Emperor.\"    \"That's just the same thing,\" replied the old man, \"my master is  asleep, he's tired.\"    Then the noise of many voices was heard, as if people were quarreling!  Again the first one repeated: \"Pea Emperor, Pea Emperor!\"    \"What is it?\" the old man answered.    \"What is one?\"    \"The moon is one.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    Then a terrible wailing arose, as if all the spirits of evil were  abroad, and another voice said:    \"What is two?\"    \"Two eyes in the head see well.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    \"What is three?\"    \"Where there are three grown daughters in a house, _beware_ of putting  your head in.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    \"What is four?\"    \"The cart with four wheels runs well.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    \"What is five?\"    \"Five fingers on the hand hold well.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    Again there was a noise like a thunder storm, and the palace shook as  if the earth was quaking. And again there was a shout for the Pea  Emperor. But the latter became more and more quiet, and scarcely  ventured to breathe, but remained perfectly still. This time, too, the  old servant answered. Another voice asked:    \"What is six?\"    \"The flute with six holes blows well.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    \"What is seven?\"    \"Where there are seven brothers, don't meddle with their affairs.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    \"What is eight?\"    \"The plow with eight oxen furrows the earth well.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    \"What is nine?\"    \"Where there are nine grown daughters in a house, it is not swept.\"    \"Is it you, master?\"    \"Burst, dragon!\"    The Pea Emperor, who heard all this, could not sleep all night long,  even when it grew so still that one might have heard a fly buzz; he  waited for daylight with the utmost impatience.    When he rose the next morning the old servant had vanished. He went  out of the palace, and what did he behold? The scattered corpses of  nine dragons, which he gave to the ravens. While thanking God for  having preserved his life and delivered him from disgrace, he heard a  sweet voice say:    \"Your compassion for the poor man saved you. Always be charitable.\"          The Morning Star and The Evening Star.      Once upon a time something extraordinary happened. If it had not  happened it would not be told.    There was once an emperor and empress who were childless. So they  sought out all the wizards and witches, all the old women and  astrologers; but their skill proved vain, no one knew how to help  them. At last the royal pair devoted themselves to almsgiving,  praying, and fasting, until one night the empress dreamed that the  Lord had taken pity on her, and appearing to her, said: \"I have heard  your prayers, and will give you a child whose like can not be found on  earth. Your husband, the emperor, must go to the brook to-morrow with  a hook and line, then you are to prepare with your own hands the fish  he catches, and eat it.\"    Before it was fairly daylight, the empress went to the emperor and  woke him, saying: \"Rise, my royal husband, it is morning.\"    \"Why, what ails you to-day, wife, that you wake me so early?\" the  emperor replied. \"Has any foe crossed the frontiers of my country?\"    \"Heaven forbid. I've heard nothing of that sort, but listen to my  dream.\"    And she told him about it.    When the emperor heard her story he jumped out of bed, dressed, took  the hook and line, and, gasping for breath, went to the brook. He  threw in the hook and soon saw the cork on the line bob. He pulled it  out, and what did he see? A big fish, made entirely of gold. It was a  wonder that he did not die of joy. But what did the empress say when  _she_ saw it? She was still more out of her wits.    The empress cooked the fish with her own hands, the royal couple ate  it, and the empress instantly felt that the promise would be  fulfilled.    The maid-servant who cleared away the table saw a fish-bone on the  empress' plate, and thought she would suck it, to know how food tastes  when prepared by royal hands.    One day the empress received the gift of a beautiful boy, as handsome  as a little angel. That same night the maid-servant, too, had a son  who looked so exactly like the prince that they could not be  distinguished from each other. The maid-servant's child precisely  resembled the royal one. The prince was named Busujok,[2] the  maid-servant's son was called Siminok.[3]    [Footnote 2: Busujok: Basil.]    [Footnote 3: Siminok: Geaphalium, cat's foot.]    They grew up together, were taught their lessons, and learned as much  in one day as other children in a whole year. When they were playing  in the garden, the empress watched them from her window with great  delight.    They became tall youths and looked so much alike that people could  never tell which was the prince and which the maid-servant's son. They  were haughty in bearing, both were charming, winning in speech, and  brave, brave to a fault.    One day they determined to go hunting. But the empress was constantly  fretting herself to find some way of recognizing her own son, for as  their faces were alike and their clothes precisely the same, she often  could not distinguish one from the other. She therefore thought of  putting some mark on the prince. So she called him, and while  pretending to be playing with his hair, knotted two locks together  without his knowledge. Then the youths went off to hunt.    They hurried joyously through the green fields, skipped about like  lambkins, gathered flowers, sprinkled themselves with dew, watched the  butterflies flit from blossom to blossom, saw the bees gather wax and  honey, and enjoyed themselves to the utmost. Then they went to the  springs, drank some water to refresh themselves, and gazed unweariedly  at the sky, which met the earth on the horizon. They would fain have  gone to the end of the world to see it close at hand, or at least far  enough to reach the spot where the earth grows marshy before it comes  to an end.    Next they went into the woods. When they saw the beauties of the  forest, they stood still with mouths wide open in astonishment.  Consider that they had not beheld any of these things in their whole  lives. When the wind blew and stirred the leaves, they listened to  their rustling, and it seemed as if the empress was passing by,  drawing her silken train after her. Then they sat down on the soft  grass, under the shade of a big tree. Here they began to reflect and  consult each other about how they were to commence hunting. They  wanted to kill nothing but wild beasts. They did not notice the birds  which hopped around them and perched on the boughs of the trees; they  would have been sorry to hurt them, for they liked to listen to their  twitter. It seemed as if the birds knew this; they showed no fear, but  sang as if they were going to split their throats; the nightingales,  however, trilled only from their craws, that their songs might be the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#17)"],[1,"thus stated by Professor H.  Carrington Bolton in a letter dated Washington, D. C., February 9, 1900:      \"Excuse delay in replying to your inquiry as to the chemical status    of the French naturalist, Lamarck. Not until this morning have I    found it convenient to go to the Library of Congress. That Library    has not the _Recherches_ nor the _Memoires_, but the position of    Lamarck is well known. He had no influence on chemistry, and his    name is not mentioned in the principal histories of chemistry. He    made no experiments, but depended upon his imagination for his    facts; he opposed the tenets of the new French school founded by    Lavoisier, and proposed a fanciful scheme of abstract principles    that remind one of alchemy.      \"Cuvier, in his _Eloge_ (_Memoires Acad. Royale des Sciences_,    1832), estimates Lamarck correctly as respects his position in    physical science.\"    Lamarck boldly carried the principle of change and evolution into  inorganic nature by the same law of change of circumstances producing  change of species.    Under the head, \"De l'espece parmi les mineraux,\" p. 149, the author  states that he had for a long time supposed that there were no species  among minerals. Here, also, he doubts, and boldly, if not rashly, in  this case, opposes accepted views, and in this field, as elsewhere,  shows, at least, his independence of thought.      \"They teach in Paris,\" he says, \"that the integrant molecule of each    kind of compound is invariable in nature, and consequently that it    is as old as nature, hence, mineral species are constant.      \"For myself, I declare that I am persuaded, and even feel convinced,    that the integrant molecule of every compound substance whatever,    may change its nature, namely, may undergo changes in the number and    in the proportions of the principles which compose it.\"    He enlarges on this subject through eight pages. He was evidently led to  take this view from his assumption that everything, every natural  object, organic or inorganic, undergoes a change. But it may be  objected that this view will not apply to minerals, because those of the  archaean rocks do not differ, and have undergone no change since then to  the present time, unless we except such minerals as are alteration  products due to metamorphism. The primary laws of nature, of physics,  and of chemistry are unchangeable, while change, progression from the  generalized to the specialized, is distinctly characteristic of the  organic as opposed to the inorganic world.

CHAPTER VIII    LAMARCK'S WORK IN GEOLOGY      Whatever may be said of his chemical and physical lucubrations, Lamarck  in his geological and palaeontological writings is, despite their errors,  always suggestive, and in some most important respects in advance of his  time. And this largely for the reason that he had once travelled, and to  some extent observed geological phenomena, in the central regions of  France, in Germany, and Hungary; visiting mines and collecting ores and  minerals, besides being in a degree familiar with the French cretaceous  fossils, but more especially those of the tertiary strata of Paris and  its vicinity. He had, therefore, from his own experience, slight as it  was, some solid grounds of facts and observations on which to meditate  and from which to reason.    He did not attempt to touch upon cosmological theories--chaos and  creation--but, rather, confined himself to the earth, and more  particularly to the action of the ocean, and to the changes which he  believed to be due to organic agencies. The most impressive truth in  geology is the conception of the immensity of past time, and this truth  Lamarck fully realized. His views are to be found in a little book of  268 pages, entitled _Hydrogeologie_. It appeared in 1802 (an X.), or  ten years before the first publication of Cuvier's famous _Discours sur  les Revolutions de la Surface du Globe_ (1812). Written in his popular  and attractive style, and thoroughly in accord with the cosmological and  theological prepossessions of the age, the Discours was widely read, and  passed through many editions. On the other hand, the _Hydrogeologie_  died stillborn, with scarcely a friend or a reader, never reaching a  second edition, and is now, like most of his works, a bibliographical  rarity.    The only writer who has said a word in its favor, or contrasted it with  the work of Cuvier, is the judicious and candid Huxley, who, though by  no means favorable to Lamarck's factors of evolution, frankly said:      \"The vast authority of Cuvier was employed in support of the    traditionally respectable hypotheses of special creation and of    catastrophism; and the wild speculations of the _Discours sur les    Revolutions de la Surface du Globe_ were held to be models of sound    scientific thinking, while the really much more sober and    philosophic hypotheses of the _Hydrogeologie_ were scouted.\"[60]    Before summarizing the contents of this book, let us glance at the  geological atmosphere--thin and tenuous as it was then--in which Lamarck  lived. The credit of being the first observer, before Steno (1669), to  state that fossils are the remains of animals which were once alive, is  due to an Italian, Frascatero, of Verona, who wrote in 1517.      \"But,\" says Lyell,[61] \"the clear and philosophical views of    Frascatero were disregarded, and the talent and argumentative powers    of the learned were doomed for three centuries to be wasted in the    discussion of these two simple and preliminary questions: First,    whether fossil remains had ever belonged to living creatures; and,    secondly, whether, if this be admitted, all the phenomena could not    be explained by the deluge of Noah.\"    Previous to this the great artist, architect, engineer, and musician,  Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), who, among other great works, planned and  executed some navigable canals in Northern Italy, and who was an  observer of rare penetration and judgment, saw how fossil shells were  formed, saying that the mud of rivers had covered and penetrated into  the interior of fossil shells at a time when these were still at the  bottom of the sea near the coast.[62]    That versatile and observing genius, Bernard Palissy, as early as 1580,  in a book entitled _The Origin of Springs from Rain-water_, and in other  writings, criticized the notions of the time, especially of Italian  writers, that petrified shells had all been left by the universal  deluge.      \"It has happened,\" said Fontenelle, in his eulogy on Palissy,    delivered before the French Academy a century and a half later,    \"that a potter who knew neither Latin nor Greek dared, toward the    end of the sixteenth century, to say in Paris, and in the presence    of all the doctors, that fossil shells were veritable shells    deposited at some time by the sea in the places where they were    then found; that the animals had given to the figured stones all    their different shapes, and that he boldly defied all the school of    Aristotle to attack his proofs.\"[63]    Then succeeded, at the end of the seventeenth century, the forerunners  of modern geology: Steno (1669), Leibnitz (1683), Ray (1692), Woodward  (1695), Vallisneri (1721), while Moro published his views in 1745. In  the eighteenth century Reaumur[64] (1720) presented a paper on the  fossil shells of Touraine.    Cuvier[65] thus pays his respects, in at least an unsympathetic way, to  the geological essayists and compilers of the seventeenth century:      \"The end of the seventeenth century lived to see the birth of a new    science, which took, in its infancy, the high-sounding name of    'Theory of the Earth.' Starting from a small number of facts, badly    observed, connecting them by fantastic suppositions, it pretended to    go back to the origin of worlds, to, as it were, play with them, and    to create their history. Its arbitrary methods, its pompous    language, altogether seemed to render it foreign to the other    sciences, and, indeed, the professional savants for a long time cast    it out of the circle of their studies.\"    Their views, often premature, composed of half-truths, were mingled with  glaring errors and fantastic misconceptions, but were none the less  germinal. Leibnitz was the first to propose the nebular hypothesis,  which was more fully elaborated by Kant and Laplace. Buffon, influenced  by the writing of Leibnitz, in his _Theorie de la Terre_, published in  1749, adopted his notion of an original volcanic nucleus and a universal  ocean, the latter as he thought leaving the land dry by draining into  subterranean caverns. He also dimly saw, or gathered from his reading,  that the mountains and valleys were due to secondary causes; that  fossiliferous strata had been deposited by ocean currents, and that  rivers had transported materials from the highlands to the lowlands. He  also states that many of the fossil shells which occur in Europe do not  live in the adjacent seas, and that there are remains of fishes and of  plants not now living in Europe, and which are either extinct or live in  more southern climates, and others in tropical seas. Also that the bones  and teeth of elephants and of the rhinoceros and hippopotamus found in  Siberia and elsewhere in northern Europe and Asia indicate that these  animals must have lived there, though at present restricted to the  tropics. In his last essay, _Epoques de la Nature_ (1778), he claims  that the earth's history may be divided into epochs, from the earliest  to the present time. The first epoch was that of fluidity, of  incandescence, when the earth and the planets assumed their form; the  second, of cooling; the third, when the waters covered the earth, and  volcanoes"]]]
