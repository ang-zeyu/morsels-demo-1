[Footnote 2-56: Memo, Brig Gen B. O. Davis for the                     IG, 24 Dec 42, IG 333.9-Great Britain.]    In an atmosphere charged with rumors and counterrumors, personal  incidents involving two men might quickly blow up into riots involving  hundreds. In the summer of 1943 the Army began to reap what Ulysses  Lee called the \"harvest of disorder.\" Race riots occurred at military  reservations in Mississippi, Georgia, California, Texas, and Kentucky.  At other stations, the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies  somberly warned, there were indications of unrest ready to erupt into  violence.[2-57] By the middle of the war, violence over racial issues at  home and abroad had become a source of constant concern for the War  Department.                       [Footnote 2-57: Memo, ASW for CofS, 3 Jul 43, sub:                     Negro Troops, ASW 291.2 NT. The Judge Advocate                     General described disturbances of this type as                     military \"mutiny.\" See The Judge Advocate General,                     _Military Justice, 1 July 1940 to 31 December                     1945_, p. 60, in CMH.]      _Internal Reform: Amending Racial Practices_    Concern over troop morale and discipline and the attendant problem of  racial violence did not lead to a substantial revision of the Army's  racial policy. On the contrary, the Army staff continued to insist  that segregation was a national issue and that the Army's task was to  defend the country, not alter its social customs. Until the nation  changed its racial practices or until Congress ordered such changes  for the armed forces, racially separated units would remain.[2-58] In  1941 the Army had insisted that debate on the subject was closed,[2-59]  and, in fact, except for discussion of the Chamberlain Plan there was  no serious thought of revising racial policy in the Army staff until  after the war.                       [Footnote 2-58: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, p.                     83.]                       [Footnote 2-59: Ltr, TAG to Dr. Amanda V. G. Hillyer,                     Chmn Program Cmte, D.C. Branch, NAACP, 12 Apr 41,                     AG 291.21 (2-28-41) (1).]    Had the debate been reopened in 1943, the traditionalists on the Army  staff would have found new support for their views in a series of surveys  made of white and black soldiers in 1942 and 1943. These surveys  supported the theory that the Army, a national institution         (p. 040)  composed of individual citizens with pronounced views on race, would  meet massive disobedience and internal disorder as well as national  resistance to any substantial change in policy. One extensive survey,  covering 13,000 soldiers in ninety-two units, revealed that 88 percent  of the whites and 38 percent of the Negroes preferred segregated  units. Among the whites, 85 percent preferred separate service clubs  and 81 percent preferred separate post exchanges. Almost half of the  Negroes thought separate service clubs and post exchanges were a good  idea.[2-60] These attitudes merely reflected widely held national  views as suggested in a 1943 survey of five key cities by the Office  of War Information.[2-61] The survey showed that 90 percent of the  whites and 25 percent of the blacks questioned supported segregation.

For a comprehensive                     expression of the attitudes of black soldiers, see                     Mary P. Motley, ed., _The Invisible Soldier: The                     Experience of the Black Soldier, World War II_                     (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1975), a                     compilation of oral histories by World War II                     veterans. Although these interviews were conducted                     a quarter of a century after the event and in the                     wake of the modern civil rights movement, they                     provide useful insight to the attitude of black                     soldiers toward discrimination in the services.]                       [Footnote 2-61: Office of War Information, The                     Negroes' Role in the War: A Study of White and                     Colored Opinions (Memorandum 59, Surveys Division,                     Bureau of Special Services), 8 Jul 43, in CMH.]    Some Army officials considered justification by statistics alone a  risky business. Reviewing the support for segregation revealed in the  surveys, for example, the Special Services Division commented: \"Many  of the Negroes and some of the whites who favor separation in the Army  indicate by their comments that they are opposed to segregation in  principle. They favor separation in the Army to avoid trouble or  unpleasantness.\" Its report added that the longer a Negro remained in  the Army, the less likely he was to support segregation.[2-62] Nor did  it follow from the overwhelming support for segregation that a policy  of integration would result in massive resistance. As critics later  pointed out, the same surveys revealed that almost half the  respondents expressed a strong preference for civilian life, but the  Army did not infer that serious disorders would result if these men  were forced to remain in uniform.[2-63]                       [Footnote 2-62: Special Services Division, \"What the                     Soldier Thinks,\" Number 2, August 1943, pp. 58-59,                     SSD 291.2.]                       [Footnote 2-63: Dollard and Young, \"In the Armed                     Forces,\" p. 68.]    By 1943 Negroes within and without the War Department had just about  exhausted arguments for a policy change. After two years of trying,  Judge Hastie came to believe that change was possible only in response  to \"strong and manifest public opinion.\" He concluded that he would be  far more useful as a private citizen who could express his views  freely and publicly than he was as a War Department employee, bound to  conform to official policy. Quitting the department, Hastie joined the  increasingly vocal black organizations in a sustained attack on the  Army's segregation policy, an attack that was also being translated  into political action by the major civil rights organizations. In  1943, a full year before the national elections, representatives of  twenty-five civil rights groups met and formulated the demands     (p. 041)  they would make of the presidential candidates: full integration (some  groups tempered this demand by calling for integrated units of  volunteers); abolition of racial quotas; abolition of segregation in  recreational and other Army facilities; abolition of blood plasma  segregation; development of an educational program in race relations  in the Army; greater black participation in combat forces; and the  progressive removal of black troops from areas where they were subject  to disrespect, abuse, and even violence.[2-64]                       [Footnote 2-64: New York _Times_, December 2, 1943.]    The Army could not afford to ignore these demands completely, as  Truman K. Gibson, Jr., Judge Hastie's successor, pointed out.[2-65] The  political situation indicated that the racial policy of the armed  forces would be an issue in the next national election. Recalling the  changes forced on the Army as a result of political pressures applied  before the 1940 election, Gibson predicted that actions that might now  seem impolitic to the Army and the White House might not seem so  during the next campaign when the black vote could influence the  outcome in several important states, including New York, Pennsylvania,  Illinois, and Michigan. Already the Chicago _Tribune_ and other  anti-administration groups were trying to encourage black protest in  terms not always accurate but nonetheless believable to the black  voter. Gibson suggested that the Army act before the political  pressure became even more intense.[2-66]                       [Footnote 2-65: Gibson, a lawyer and a graduate of                     the University of Chicago, became Judge Hastie's                     assistant in 1940. After Hastie's resignation on 29                     January 1943, Gibson served as acting civilian aide                     and assumed the position permanently on 21                     September 1943. See Memo, ASW for Admin Asst (John                     W. Martyn), 21 Sep 43, ASW 291.2 NT-Civ Aide.]                       [Footnote 2-66: Memo, Gibson to ASW, 3 Nov 43, ASW                     291.2 NT. See also New York _Times_, December 2,                     1943.]    Caught between the black demands and War Department traditions, the  Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies launched an attack--much  too late and too weak, its critics agreed--on what it perceived as the  causes of the Army's racial disorders. Some of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#17)"],[1,"of life, till I shall disclose to thee more of my will.\"    The news of so unlucky an event soon reached the ears of the Emir, who  abandoned himself to grief and despair, and began, as did all his old  grey-beards, to begrime his visage with ashes.  A total supineness  ensued, travellers were no longer entertained, no more plaisters were  spread, and, instead of the charitable activity that had distinguished  this asylum, the whole of its inhabitants exhibited only faces of a half  cubit long, and uttered groans that accorded with their forlorn  situation.    Though Fakreddin bewailed his daughter as lost to him for ever, yet  Gulchenrouz was not forgotten.  He despatched immediate instruction to  Sutlememe, Shaban, and the dwarfs, enjoining them not to undeceive the  child in respect to his state, but, under some pretence, to convey him  far from the lofty rock at the extremity of the lake, to a place which he  should appoint, as safer from danger; for he suspected that Vathek  intended him evil.    Gulchenrouz in the meanwhile was filled with amazement at not finding his  cousin; nor were the dwarfs at all less surprised; but Sutlememe, who had  more penetration, immediately guessed what had happened.  Gulchenrouz was  amused with the delusive hope of once more embracing Nouronihar in the  interior recesses of the mountains, where the ground, strewed over with  orange blossoms and jasmines, offered beds much more inviting than the  withered leaves in their cabin, where they might accompany with their  voices the sounds of their lutes, and chase butterflies in concert.  Sutlememe was far gone in this sort of description, when one of the four  eunuchs beckoned her aside to apprise her of the arrival of a messenger  from their fraternity, who had explained the secret of the flight of  Nouronihar, and brought the commands of the Emir.  A council with Shaban  and the dwarfs was immediately held; their baggage being stowed in  consequence of it, they embarked in a shallop, and quietly sailed with  the little one, who acquiesced in all their proposals; their voyage  proceeded in the same manner till they came to the place where the lake  sinks beneath the hollow of the rock; but as soon as the bark had entered  it, and Gulchenrouz found himself surrounded with darkness, he was seized  with a dreadful consternation, and incessantly uttered the most piercing  outcries; for he now was persuaded he should actually be damned for  having taken too much freedom in his life-time with his cousin.    But let us return to the Caliph and her who ruled over his heart.  Bababalouk had pitched the tents, and closed up the extremities of the  valley with magnificent screens of India cloth, which were guarded by  Ethiopian slaves with their drawn sabres; to preserve the verdure of this  beautiful enclosure in its natural freshness, the white eunuchs went  continually round it with their red water-vessels.  The waving of fans  was heard near the imperial pavilion, where, by the voluptuous light that  glowed through the muslins, the Caliph enjoyed at full view all the  attractions of Nouronihar.  Inebriated with delight, he was all ear to  her charming voice, which accompanied the lute; while she was not less  captivated with his descriptions of Samarah and the tower full of  wonders, but especially with his relation of the adventure of the ball,  and the chasm of the Giaour, with its ebony portal.    In this manner they conversed for a day and a night; they bathed together  in a basin of black marble, which admirably relieved the fairness of  Nouronihar.  Bababalouk, whose good graces this beauty had regained,  spared no attention that their repasts might be served up with the  minutest exactness; some exquisite rarity was ever placed before them;  and he sent even to Schiraz for that fragrant and delicious wine which  had been hoarded up in bottles prior to the birth of Mahomet; he had  excavated little ovens in the rock to bake the nice manchets which were  prepared by the hands of Nouronihar, from whence they had derived a  flavour so grateful to Vathek, that he regarded the ragouts of his other  wives as entirely mawkish; whilst they would have died at the Emir's of  chagrin at finding themselves so neglected, if Fakreddin, notwithstanding  his resentment, had not taken pity upon them.    The Sultana Dilara, who till then had been the favourite, took this  dereliction of the Caliph to heart with a vehemence natural to her  character, for during her continuance in favour she had imbibed from  Vathek many of his extravagant fancies, and was fired with impatience to  behold the superb tombs of Istakar, and the palace of forty columns;  besides, having been brought up amongst the Magi, she had fondly  cherished the idea of the Caliph's devoting himself to the worship of  fire; thus his voluptuous and desultory life with her rival was to her a  double source of affliction.  The transient piety of Vathek had  occasioned her some serious alarms, but the present was an evil of far  greater magnitude; she resolved, therefore, without hesitation, to write  to Carathis, and acquaint her that all things went ill; that they had  eaten, slept, and revelled at an old Emir's, whose sanctity was very  formidable, and that after all, the prospect of possessing the treasures  of the pre-adamite Sultans was no less remote than before.  This letter  was entrusted to the care of two wood-men, who were at work on one of the  great forests of the mountains, and, being acquainted with the shortest  cuts, arrived in ten days at Samarah.    The Princess Carathis was engaged at chess with Morakanabad, when the  arrival of these wood-fellers was announced.  She, after some weeks of  Vathek's absence, had forsaken the upper regions of her tower, because  everything appeared in confusion among the stars, whom she consulted  relative to the fate of her son.  In vain did she renew her fumigations,  and extend herself on the roof to obtain mystic visions; nothing more  could she see in her dreams than pieces of brocade, nosegays of flowers,  and other unmeaning gewgaws.  These disappointments had thrown her into a  state of dejection, which no drug in her power was sufficient to remove;  her only resource was in Morakanabad, who was a good man, and endowed  with a decent share of confidence, yet whilst in her company he never  thought himself on roses.    No person knew aught of Vathek, and a thousand ridiculous stories were  propagated at his expense.  The eagerness of Carathis may be easily  guessed at receiving the letter, as well as her rage at reading the  dissolute conduct of her son.  \"Is it so?\" said she; \"either I will  perish, or Vathek shall enter the palace of fire.  Let me expire in  flames, provided he may reign on the throne of Soliman!\"  Having said  this, and whirled herself round in a magical manner, which struck  Morakanabad with such terror as caused him to recoil, she ordered her  great camel Alboufaki to be brought, and the hideous Nerkes with the  unrelenting Cafour to attend.  \"I require no other retinue,\" said she to  Morakanabad; \"I am going on affairs of emergency; a truce therefore to  parade!  Take you care of the people; fleece them well in my absence; for  we shall expend large sums, and one knows not what may betide.\"    The night was uncommonly dark, and a pestilential blast ravaged the plain  of Catoul that would have deterred any other traveller, however urgent  the call; but Carathis enjoyed most whatever filled others with dread.  Nerkes concurred in opinion with her, and Cafour had a particular  predilection for a pestilence.  In the morning this accomplished caravan,  with the wood-fellers who directed their route, halted on the edge of an  extensive marsh, from whence so noxious a vapour arose as would have  destroyed any animal but Alboufaki, who naturally inhaled these malignant  fogs.  The peasants entreated their convoy not to sleep in this place.    \"To sleep,\" cried Carathis; \"what an excellent thought!  I never sleep  but for visions; and, as to my attendants, their occupations are too many  to close the only eye they each have.\"    The poor peasants, who were not over-pleased with their party, remained  open-mouthed with surprise.    Carathis alighted, as well as her negresses, and severally stripping off  their outer garments, they all ran in their drawers, to cull from those  spots where the sun shone fiercest the venomous plants that grew on the  marsh; this provision was made for the family of the Emir, and whoever  might retard the expedition to Istakar.  The wood-men were overcome with  fear when they beheld these three horrible phantoms run, and, not much  relishing the company of Alboufaki, stood aghast at the command of  Carathis to set forward, notwithstanding it was noon, and the heat fierce  enough to calcine even rocks.  In spite, however, of every remonstrance,  they were forced implicitly to submit.    Alboufaki, who delighted in solitude, constantly snorted whenever he  perceived himself near a habitation; and Carathis, who was apt to spoil  him with indulgence, as constantly turned him aside, so that the peasants  were precluded from procuring subsistence; for the milch goats and ewes,  which Providence had sent towards the district they traversed, to refresh  travellers with their milk, all fled at the sight of the hideous animal  and his strange riders.  As to Carathis, she needed no common aliment,  for her invention had previously furnished her with an opiate to stay her  stomach, some of which she imparted to her mutes.    At the fall of night Alboufaki, making a sudden stop, stamped with his  foot, which to Carathis, who understood his paces, was a certain  indication that she was near the confines of some cemetery.  The moon  shed a bright light on the spot, which served to discover a long wall,  with a large door in it standing ajar, and so high that Alboufaki might  easily enter.  "]]]
