Such an opening might never  happen again. He waited till the ship had steadied herself after  an apparently suicidal dive into an enormous roller, then,  staggering back to her side, spoke.    \"Love is the biggest thing in life!\" he roared.    \"What is?\" shrieked Ann.    \"Love!\" bellowed Jimmy.    He wished a moment later that he had postponed this statement of  faith, for their next steps took them into a haven of comparative  calm, where some dimly seen portion of the vessel's anatomy  jutted out and formed a kind of nook where it was possible to  hear the ordinary tones of the human voice. He halted here, and  Ann did the same, though unwillingly. She was conscious of a  feeling of disappointment and of a modification of her mood of  comradeship towards her companion. She held strong views, which  she believed to be unalterable, on the subject under discussion.    \"Love!\" she said. It was too dark to see her face, but her voice  sounded unpleasantly scornful. \"I shouldn't have thought that you  would have been so conventional as that. You seemed different.\"    \"Eh?\" said Jimmy blankly.    \"I hate all this talk about Love, as if it were something  wonderful that was worth everything else in life put together.  Every book you read and every song that you see in the  shop-windows is all about Love. It's as if the whole world were  in a conspiracy to persuade themselves that there's a wonderful  something just round the corner which they can get if they try  hard enough. And they hypnotise themselves into thinking of  nothing else and miss all the splendid things of life.\"    \"That's Shaw, isn't it?\" said Jimmy.    \"What is Shaw?\"    \"What you were saying. It's out of one of Bernard Shaw's things,  isn't it?\"    \"It is not.\" A note of acidity had crept into Ann's voice. \"It is  perfectly original.\"    \"I'm certain I've heard it before somewhere.\"    \"If you have, that simply means that you must have associated  with some sensible person.\"    Jimmy was puzzled.    \"But why the grouch?\" he asked.    \"I don't understand you.\"    \"I mean, why do you feel that way about it?\"    Ann was quite certain now that she did not like this young man  nearly as well as she had supposed. It is trying for a  strong-minded, clear-thinking girl to have her philosophy  described as a grouch.    \"Because I've had the courage to think about it for myself, and  not let myself be blinded by popular superstition. The whole  world has united in making itself imagine that there is something  called love which is the most wonderful happening in life. The  poets and novelists have simply hounded them on to believe it.  It's a gigantic swindle.\"    A wave of tender compassion swept over Jimmy. He understood it  all now. Naturally a girl who had associated all her life with  the Rollos, Clarences, Dwights, and Twombleys would come to  despair of the possibility of falling in love with any one.    \"You haven't met the right man,\" he said. She had, of course, but  only recently: and, anyway, he could point that out later.    \"There is no such thing as the right man,\" said Ann resolutely,  \"if you are suggesting that there is a type of man in existence  who is capable of inspiring what is called romantic love. I  believe in marriage. . . .\"    \"Good work!\" said Jimmy, well satisfied.    \" . . . But not as the result of a sort of delirium. I believe in  it as a sensible partnership between two friends who know each  other well and trust each other. The right way of looking at  marriage is to realise, first of all, that there are no thrills,  no romances, and then to pick out some one who is nice and kind  and amusing and full of life and willing to do things to make you  happy.\"    \"Ah!\" said Jimmy, straightening his tie, \"Well, that's  something.\"    \"How do you mean--that's something? Are you shocked at my views?\"    \"I don't believe they are your views. You've been reading one of  these stern, soured fellows who analyse things.\"    Ann stamped. The sound was inaudible, but Jimmy noticed the  movement.    \"Cold?\" he said. \"Let's walk on.\"    Ann's sense of humour reasserted itself. It was not often that it  remained dormant for so long. She laughed.    \"I know exactly what you are thinking,\" she said. \"You believe  that I am posing, that those aren't my real opinions.\"    \"They can't be. But I don't think you are posing. It's getting on  for dinner-time, and you've got that wan, sinking feeling that  makes you look upon the world and find it a hollow fraud. The  bugle will be blowing in a few minutes, and half an hour after  that you will be yourself again.\"    \"I'm myself now. I suppose you can't realise that a pretty girl  can hold such views.\"    Jimmy took her arm.    \"Let me help you,\" he said. \"There's a knothole in the deck.  Watch your step. Now, listen to me. I'm glad you've brought up  this subject--I mean the subject of your being the prettiest girl  in the known world--\"    \"I never said that.\"    \"Your modesty prevented you. But it's a fact, nevertheless. I'm  glad, I say, because I have been thinking a lot along those lines  myself, and I have been anxious to discuss the point with you.  You have the most glorious hair I have ever seen!\"    \"Do you like red hair?\"    \"Red-gold.\"    \"It is nice of you to put it like that. When I was a child all  except a few of the other children called me Carrots.\"    \"They have undoubtedly come to a bad end by this time. If bears  were sent to attend to the children who criticised Elijah, your  little friends were in line for a troupe of tigers. But there  were some of a finer fibre? There were a few who didn't call you  Carrots?\"    \"One or two. They called me Brick-Top.\"    \"They have probably been electrocuted since. Your eyes are  perfectly wonderful!\"    Ann withdrew her arm. An extensive acquaintance of young men told  her that the topic of conversation was now due to be changed.    \"You will like America,\" she said.    \"We are not discussing America.\"    \"I am. It is a wonderful country for a man who wants to succeed.  If I were you, I should go out West.\"    \"Do you live out West?\"    \"No.\"    \"Then why suggest my going there? Where do you live?\"    \"I live in New York.\"    \"I shall stay in New York, then.\"    Ann was wary, but amused. Proposals of marriage--and Jimmy seemed  to be moving swiftly towards one--were no novelty in her life. In  the course of several seasons at Bar Harbor, Tuxedo, Palm Beach,  and in New York itself, she had spent much of her time foiling  and discouraging the ardour of a series of sentimental youths who  had laid their unwelcome hearts at her feet.    \"New York is open for staying in about this time, I believe.\"    Jimmy was silent. He had done his best to fight a tendency to  become depressed and had striven by means of a light tone to keep  himself resolutely cheerful, but the girl's apparently total  indifference to him was too much for his spirits. One of the  young men who had had to pick up the heart he had flung at Ann's  feet and carry it away for repairs had once confided to an  intimate friend, after the sting had to some extent passed, that  the feelings of a man who made love to Ann might be likened to  the emotions which hot chocolate might be supposed to entertain  on contact with vanilla ice-cream. Jimmy, had the comparison been  presented to him, would have endorsed its perfect accuracy. The  wind from the sea, until now keen and bracing, had become merely  infernally cold. The song of the wind in the rigging, erstwhile  melodious, had turned into a damned depressing howling.    \"I used to be as sentimental as any one a few years ago,\" said  Ann, returning to the dropped subject. \"Just after I left  college, I was quite maudlin. I dreamed of moons and Junes and  loves and doves all the time. Then something happened which made  me see what a little fool I was. It wasn't pleasant at the time,  but it had a very bracing effect. I have been quite different  ever since. It was a man, of course, who did it. His method was  quite simple. He just made fun of me, and Nature did the rest.\"    Jimmy scowled in the darkness. Murderous thoughts towards the  unknown brute flooded his mind.    \"I wish I could meet him!\" he growled.    \"You aren't likely to,\" said Ann. \"He lives in England. His name  is Crocker. Jimmy Crocker. I spoke about him just now.\"    Through the howling of the wind cut the sharp notes of a bugle.  Ann turned to the saloon entrance.    \"Dinner!\" she said brightly. \"How hungry one gets on board ship!\"  She stopped. \"Aren't you coming down, Mr. Bayliss?\"    \"Not just yet,\" said Jimmy thickly.        CHAPTER VIII    PAINFUL SCENE IN A CAFE    The noonday sun beat down on Park Row. Hurrying mortals, released  from a thousand offices, congested the sidewalks, their thoughts  busy with the vision of lunch. Up and down the canyon of Nassau  Street the crowds moved more slowly. Candy-selling aliens jostled  newsboys, and huge dray-horses endeavoured to the best of their  ability not to grind the citizenry beneath their hooves.  Eastward, pressing on to the City Hall, surged the usual dense  army of happy lovers on their way to buy marriage-licenses. Men  popped in and out of the subway entrances like rabbits. It was a  stirring, bustling scene, typical of this nerve-centre of New  York's vast body.    Jimmy Crocker, standing in the doorway, watched the throngs  enviously. There were men in that crowd who chewed gum, there  were men who wore white satin ties with imitation diamond  stick-pins, there were men who, having smoked seven-tenths of a  cigar, were eating the remainder: but there was not one with whom  he would not at that moment willingly have exchanged identities.  For these men had jobs. And in his present frame of mind it  seemed to him that no further ingredient was needed for the  recipe of the ultimate human bliss.    The poet has said some "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#17)"],[1," impostures.\"    \"Ha!  Is it come to this?\" thundered the Stranger:  \"then meet your  fate:  out of your Plane you go.  Once, twice, thrice!  'Tis done!\"          Section 18.  How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there        An unspeakable horror seized me.  There was a darkness; then a dizzy,  sickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line  that was no Line; Space that was not Space: I was myself, and not  myself.  When I could find voice, I shrieked aloud in agony, \"Either  this is madness or it is Hell.\" \"It is neither,\" calmly replied the  voice of the Sphere, \"it is Knowledge; it is Three Dimensions:  open  your eye once again and try to look steadily.\"    I looked, and, behold, a new world!  There stood before me, visibly  incorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured, dreamed, of  perfect Circular beauty.  What seemed the centre of the Stranger's form  lay open to my view:  yet I could see no heart, nor lungs, nor  arteries, only a beautiful harmonious Something--for which I had no  words; but you, my Readers in Spaceland, would call it the surface of  the Sphere.    Prostrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, \"How is it, O  divine ideal of consummate loveliness and wisdom that I see thy inside,  and yet cannot discern thy heart, thy lungs, thy arteries, thy liver?\"  \"What you think you see, you see not,\" he replied; \"it is not given to  you, nor to any other Being to behold my internal parts.  I am of a  different order of Beings from those in Flatland.  Were I a Circle, you  could discern my intestines, but I am a Being, composed as I told you  before, of many Circles, the Many in the One, called in this country a  Sphere.  And, just as the outside of a Cube is a Square, so the outside  of a Sphere presents the appearance of a Circle.\"    Bewildered though I was by my Teacher's enigmatic utterance, I no  longer chafed against it, but worshipped him in silent adoration.  He  continued, with more mildness in his voice.  \"Distress not yourself if  you cannot at first understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland.  By  degrees they will dawn upon you.  Let us begin by casting back a glance  at the region whence you came.  Return with me a while to the plains of  Flatland, and I will shew you that which you have often reasoned and  thought about, but never seen with the sense of sight--a visible  angle.\"  \"Impossible!\" I cried; but, the Sphere leading the way, I  followed as if in a dream, till once more his voice arrested me:  \"Look  yonder, and behold your own Pentagonal house, and all its inmates.\"    I looked below, and saw with my physical eye all that domestic  individuality which I had hitherto merely inferred with the  understanding.  And how poor and shadowy was the inferred conjecture in  comparison with the reality which I now beheld!  My four Sons calmly  asleep in the North-Western rooms, my two orphan Grandsons to the  South; the Servants, the Butler, my Daughter, all in their several  apartments.  Only my affectionate Wife, alarmed by my continued  absence, had quitted her room and was roving up and down in the Hall,  anxiously awaiting my return.  Also the Page, aroused by my cries, had  left his room, and under pretext of ascertaining whether I had fallen  somewhere in a faint, was prying into the cabinet in my study.  All  this I could now SEE, not merely infer; and as we came nearer and  nearer, I could discern even the contents of my cabinet, and the two  chests of gold, and the tablets of which the Sphere had made mention.

It was even as the  Sphere had said.  The further we receded from the object we beheld, the  larger became the field of vision.  My native city, with the interior  of every house and every creature therein, lay open to my view in  miniature.  We mounted higher, and lo, the secrets of the earth, the  depths of mines and inmost caverns of the hills, were bared before me.    Awestruck at the sight of the mysteries of the earth, thus unveiled  before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion, \"Behold, I am become as  a God.  For the wise men in our country say that to see all things, or  as they express it, OMNIVIDENCE, is the attribute of God alone.\"  There  was something of scorn in the voice of my Teacher as he made answer:  \"Is it so indeed?  Then the very pick-pockets and cut-throats of my  country are to be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods: for there  is not one of them that does not see as much as you see now.  But trust  me, your wise men are wrong.\"    I.  Then is omnividence the attribute of others besides Gods?    SPHERE.  I do not know.  But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat of our  country can see everything that is in your country, surely that is no  reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be accepted by you as a  God.  This omnividence, as you call it--it is not a common word in  Spaceland--does it make you more just, more merciful, less selfish,  more loving?  Not in the least.  Then how does it make you more divine?    I.  \"More merciful, more loving!\"  But these are the qualities of  women!  And we know that a Circle is a higher Being than a Straight  Line, in so far as knowledge and wisdom are more to be esteemed than  mere affection.    SPHERE.  It is not for me to classify human faculties according to  merit.  Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more of the  affections than of the understanding, more of your despised Straight  Lines than of your belauded Circles.  But enough of this.  Look yonder.  Do you know that building?    I looked, and afar off I saw an immense Polygonal structure, in which I  recognized the General Assembly Hall of the States of Flatland,  surrounded by dense lines of Pentagonal buildings at right angles to  each other, which I knew to be streets; and I perceived that I was  approaching the great Metropolis.    \"Here we descend,\" said my Guide.  It was now morning, the first hour  of the first day of the two thousandth year of our era.  Acting, as was  their wont, in strict accordance with precedent, the highest Circles of  the realm were meeting in solemn conclave, as they had met on the first  hour of the first day of the year 1000, and also on the first hour of  the first day of the year 0.    The minutes of the previous meetings were now read by one whom I at  once recognized as my brother, a perfectly Symmetrical Square, and the  Chief Clerk of the High Council.  It was found recorded on each  occasion that:  \"Whereas the States had been troubled by divers  ill-intentioned persons pretending to have received revelations from  another World, and professing to produce demonstrations whereby they  had instigated to frenzy both themselves and others, it had been for  this cause unanimously resolved by the Grand Council that on the first  day of each millenary, special injunctions be sent to the Prefects in  the several districts of Flatland, to make strict search for such  misguided persons, and without formality of mathematical examination,  to destroy all such as were Isosceles of any degree, to scourge and  imprison any regular Triangle, to cause any Square or Pentagon to be  sent to the district Asylum, and to arrest any one of higher rank,  sending him straightway to the Capital to be examined and judged by the  Council.\"    \"You hear your fate,\" said the Sphere to me, while the Council was  passing for the third time the formal resolution.  \"Death or  imprisonment awaits the Apostle of the Gospel of Three Dimensions.\"  \"Not so,\" replied I, \"the matter is now so clear to me, the nature of  real space so palpable, that methinks I could make a child understand  it.  Permit me but to descend at this moment and enlighten them.\"  \"Not  yet,\" said my Guide, \"the time will come for that.  Meantime I must  perform my mission.  Stay thou there in thy place.\"  Saying these  words, he leaped with great dexterity into the sea (if I may so call  it) of Flatland, right in the midst of the ring of Counsellors.  \"I  come,\" cried he, \"to proclaim that there is a land of Three Dimensions.\"    I could see many of the younger Counsellors start back in manifest  horror, as the Sphere's circular section widened before them.  But on a  sign from the presiding Circle--who shewed not the slightest alarm or  surprise--six Isosceles of a low type from six different quarters  rushed upon the Sphere.  \"We have him,\" they cried; \"No; yes; we have  him still! he's going!  he's gone!\"    \"My"]]]
