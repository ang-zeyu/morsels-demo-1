Roosevelt and all the other leaders knew  that this would not do, and at a great risk they continued to advance,  until some Spaniards were at last discovered across a valley to the  right of where the troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt were  located.    \"There they are!\" was the cry. \"Forward and at 'em, boys! Down with the  Dons!\" Without delay some sharpshooters fired on the Spaniards, and then  the regular troops opened up, and at last the Spaniards ran from cover.    Bullets were now flying in all directions, and both sides were making  their shots tell. The Americans had but scant protection, and it was not  long before a number of them fell. Some bullets came close to Theodore  Roosevelt, and one hit a palm tree near where he was standing, filling  his left eye and ear with the dust and splinters. Had that Mauser bullet  come a few inches closer, the man who was destined to become the future  President of our country might have been killed on the spot.    In the midst of the skirmish--for the conflict proved to be nothing  more--there was a report that Colonel Wood was dead, and Theodore  Roosevelt took it upon himself to restore the fighting line of Rough  Riders to order. But happily the report proved false; and a little while  after this the skirmish came to an end, and both Spaniards and Americans  betook themselves to positions of greater safety. In this skirmish,  brief as it was, the Rough Riders lost eight men killed and nearly forty  wounded.          CHAPTER XV    ALONG THE JUNGLE TRAIL--FORDING THE RIVER--OPENING OF THE BATTLE OF SAN  JUAN HILL--BRAVERY OF THE ROUGH RIDERS--PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF THEODORE  ROOSEVELT DURING THE BATTLE      Taken as a whole, the skirmish at La Guasima was quite an important one,  for it showed the Spaniards that our soldiers were bound to advance upon  Santiago, be the cost what it might.    More than this, it showed that Theodore Roosevelt was brave under fire.  During the skirmish he paid but scant attention to his own personal  safety. He went wherever he thought he was needed, and the fact that  Mauser bullets were flying about in all directions did not daunt him.    \"He was about as cool a man as I ever saw in a fight,\" said one old  soldier. \"He did all he could to encourage the men, and had a kind word  for every man he ran across who was wounded. Once, in the thickest of  the brush, he grabbed up a gun and began to shoot with us, and I reckon  he fired as straight as anybody there, for he had had lots of practice  while hunting.\"    The Spaniards had been driven from their pits and from the sugar-house  of the plantation, and now took good care to keep out of sight.  Picket-guards were thrown out by the officers of the army, and those who  had been in the fight took a much-needed rest, and looked after the dead  and wounded. There was certainly a touching scene at the temporary  hospital, where one soldier started to sing \"My Country, 'tis of Thee,\"  and many others joined in. On the following morning the dead were  buried, the men gathering around the one common grave to sing \"Rock of  Ages\" in a manner that brought tears to the eyes of many.    From La Guasima the Rough Riders moved to the bank of a small stream in  the neighborhood. Part of the army was ahead of them and the rest  behind, and for several days nothing unusual occurred. But during that  time General Young caught the fever, whereupon Colonel Wood had to take  charge of the brigade, and Lieutenant-Colonel Roosevelt took command of  the Rough Riders.    It was now the end of June, and the weather was anything but agreeable.  When the rain did not come down in torrents, the sun shone with a glare  and a heat that was terrific. As said before, the uniforms of the Rough  Riders were heavy, and much clothing had to be cast aside as unfit for  use. To add to the discomfort, rations that were promised failed to  appear, so that a good square meal was almost unknown.    \"This will not do; the men must have enough to eat, even if I have to  buy it for them,\" said Acting Colonel Roosevelt, and made two trips down  to the seacoast in search of beans, tomatoes, and other things to eat.  Here he was informed that he could only buy stuff meant for the  officers.    \"All right; I'll buy the things for the officers,\" he answered, and  purchased as much as they would allow. When he got back, he turned the  food over to the officers, but saw to it that they gave their men a fair  share.    \"It was a kindness none of his men ever forgot,\" said a soldier who was  there. \"It wasn't any of his business to buy the grub,--the commissary  department had to supply it free,--but he knew we might starve while  the department was getting itself straightened out and ready to do the  right thing. Before he went on a hunt for food, all we had was salt  pork, hardtack, and coffee, and some of the stuff wasn't fit to put in  your mouth.\" And this testimony was the testimony of scores of others.    The Spaniards were strongly intrenched upon the outskirts of Santiago,  and as it was a rough, hilly country, with many shallow streams and much  jungle, it was hard for the American army to advance. It was General  Shafter's idea to form a grand semicircle around Santiago, starting from  El Caney on the north, and running in an irregular line to Aguadores on  the south. Throughout this territory the Spaniards had done everything  possible to hinder the advance of our troops. Barbed wire was strung in  many directions, and often the brushwood would conceal dangerous  pitfalls, so that any advance had to be made with great caution.    The attack upon the Spanish lines began on July 1, and the fighting took  place in several quarters at once, but was unusually heavy at El Caney  and at San Juan Hill. At El Caney the heroic General Lawton was in  command, and fought as gallantly as he afterward did in the Philippines.  Some of the charges were terrific, and will ever be remembered by those  who participated in them.    The Rough Riders struck camp and moved along the trail on the last day  of June. It was as hot as ever, with no sign of rain. The trail was  filled with troops and provision wagons, and the progress, consequently,  was slow.    \"Let us get into the fight!\" was the cry heard on every side. \"Don't  keep us waiting any longer.\"    \"Keep cool,\" said one of the officers. \"You'll get all the fighting you  want soon.\" And so it proved.    At a little after eight o'clock in the evening the Rough Riders found  themselves on El Poso Hill, and here the whole brigade to which they  were attached went into camp.    \"It wasn't much of a camp,\" said one who was there. \"We just threw out a  strong picket-guard and went to sleep on our arms, and glad of it, after  that day in the broiling sun. We had had to ford some pretty muddy  streams, and all of us were water and mud up to our knees. But everybody  was as enthusiastic to fight as ever.\"    At sunrise the battle opened at El Caney, and the Rough Riders could  hear the booming of cannon. At once all was activity, and the men  prepared to move ahead at a moment's notice.    Acting Colonel Roosevelt was with Colonel Wood at the time, and both  were listening to the roar of the artillery.    \"I wish we could move--\" began Colonel Wood, when, of a sudden, both he  and Theodore Roosevelt heard a strange humming sound in the air. Then  came the explosion of a shrapnel shell over their heads, and both leaped  to their feet.    \"This is getting warm!\" cried Theodore Roosevelt, and ran toward his  horse, when boom! came another explosion, and one of the bullets fell  upon his wrist, making, as he himself says, \"a bump about as big as a  hickory nut.\" This same shell, he adds, wounded four of the men under  him and two or three regulars, one of whom lost his leg. Certainly  another providential escape on the part of the future President.    Without loss of time Theodore Roosevelt ordered his troops into the  underbrush, and here, for the time being, they were safe. On account of  the smokeless powder they used, the Spanish batteries could not be  precisely located, so our own artillery were at a slight disadvantage.    But now the blood of the Americans was fully aroused, and soon came an  order for a general advance,--something that was hailed with wild  delight by the Rough Riders.    \"Hurrah, now we'll show 'em what the Yankees can do!\" was the cry. \"Down  with the Dons! Three cheers for Uncle Sam!\"    The Rough Riders had to ford the river, and while they were doing this,  a balloon that had been used for observations came down in that vicinity  and attracted the attention of the Spanish sharpshooters. The firing was  now heavy on all sides, and many a gallant soldier went down to rise no  more.    Then came another wait of an hour, during which the Rough Riders rested  in a hollow leading up from the river. Again there was grumbling. With  so much fighting on all sides, why could they not advance?    \"We'll get our turn,\" said Theodore Roosevelt. And soon after a staff  officer dashed up with orders to move forward and support the cavalry of  the regular army on the hills in front.    \"Now to the front!\" was the cry. \"Down with the Dons!\" And away went  troop after troop on the double-quick, with Acting Colonel Roosevelt  leading them. Shot and shell were hurling themselves through the air in  all directions, and on all sides could be heard the shrieks and groans  of the dead and the dying. It was a time long to be remembered. Men went  down in all directions, and with them not a few officers. It was so hot  that Roosevelt's orderly was prostrated from the heat and afterward  died. Roosevelt summoned another Rough Rider, and had just finished  giving the man some orders when the soldier pitched forward upon his  commander, killed by a bullet through the throat.    As the troops advanced, Theodore Roosevelt urged"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22373"],[0,"Russian Fairy Tales: A Choice Collection of Muscovite Folk-lore (#17)"],[1,"carry me into the other world,\" he replied.      \"Make me a large _zasyek_[89] with a partition in the middle,\"    she said; \"catch all sorts of game, and put them into one half    of it, and into the other half pour water; so that there may be    meat and drink for me.\"      All this the Prince did. Then the bird--having taken the    _zasyek_ on her back, with the Prince sitting in the middle of it--began    to fly. And after flying some distance she brought him    to his journey's end, took leave of him, and flew away back.    But he went to the house of a certain tailor, and engaged himself    as his servant. So much the worse for wear was he, so    thoroughly had he altered in appearance, that nobody would    have suspected him of being a Prince.      Having entered into the service of this master, the Prince    began to ask what was going on in that country. And his    master replied: \"Our two princes--for the third one has disappeared--have    brought away brides from the other world, and    want to marry them, but those brides refuse. For they insist    on having all their wedding-clothes made for them first, exactly    like those which they used to have in the other world, and that    without being measured for them. The King has called all the    workmen together, but not one of them will undertake to do it.\"      The Prince, having heard all this, said, \"Go to the King,    master, and tell him that you will provide everything that's in    your line.\"      \"However can I undertake to make clothes of that sort;    I work for quite common folks,\" says his master.      \"Go along, master! I will answer for everything,\" says    the Prince.      So the tailor went. The King was delighted that at least    one good workman had been found, and gave him as much    money as ever he wanted. When the tailor had settled everything,    he went home. And the Prince said to him:      \"Now then, pray to God, and lie down to sleep; to-morrow    all will be ready.\" And the tailor followed his lad's advice,    and went to bed.      Midnight sounded. The Prince arose, went out of the city    into the fields, took out of his pocket the eggs which the    maidens had given him, and, as they had taught him, turned    them into three palaces. Into each of these he entered, took    the maidens' robes, went out again, turned the palaces back    into eggs, and went home. And when he got there he hung up    the robes on the wall, and lay down to sleep.      Early in the morning his master awoke, and behold! there    hung such robes as he had never seen before, all shining with    gold and silver and precious stones. He was delighted, and he    seized them and carried them off to the King. When the princesses    saw that the clothes were those which had been theirs in    the other world, they guessed that Prince Ivan was in this    world, so they exchanged glances with each other, but they    held their peace. And the master, having handed over the    clothes, went home, but he no longer found his dear journeyman    there. For the Prince had gone to a shoemaker's, and him too    he sent to work for the King; and in the same way he went the    round of all the artificers, and they all proffered him thanks,    inasmuch as through him they were enriched by the King.      By the time the princely workman had gone the round of all    the artificers, the princesses had received what they had asked    for; all their clothes were just like what they had been in the    other world. Then they wept bitterly because the Prince had    not come, and it was impossible for them to hold out any    longer, it was necessary that they should be married. But when    they were ready for the wedding, the youngest bride said to the    King:      \"Allow me, my father, to go and give alms to the beggars.\"      He gave her leave, and she went and began bestowing alms    upon them, and examining them closely. And when she had    come to one of them, and was going to give him some money,    she caught sight of the ring which she had given to the Prince    in the other world, and her sisters' rings too--for it really was    he. So she seized him by the hand, and brought him into the    hall, and said to the King:      \"Here is he who brought us out of the other world. His    brothers forbade us to say that he was alive, threatening to slay    us if we did.\"      Then the King was wroth with those sons, and punished    them as he thought best. And afterwards three weddings were    celebrated.          [The conclusion of this story is somewhat obscure.        Most of the variants represent the Prince as forgiving        his brothers, and allowing them to marry two of the        three princesses, but the present version appears to        keep closer to its original, in which the prince        doubtless married all three. With this story may be        compared: Grimm, No. 166, \"Der starke Hans,\" and No.        91, \"Dat Erdmaenneken.\" See also vol. iii. p. 165,        where a reference is given to the Hungarian story in        Gaal, No. 5--Dasent, No. 55, \"The Big Bird Dan,\" and        No. 56, \"Soria Moria Castle\" (Asbjoernsen and Moe, Nos.        3 and 2.

See also No. 26, very        similar to which is the Servian Story in \"Vuk        Karajich,\" No. 2--and a very interesting Tuscan story        printed for the first time by A. de Gubernatis,        \"Zoological Mythology,\" vol. ii. p. 187. See also        ibid. p. 391.          But still more important than these are the parallels        offered by Indian fiction. Take, for instance, the        story of Sringabhuja, in chap. xxxix. of book vii. of        the \"Kathasaritsagara.\" In it the elder sons of a        certain king wish to get rid of their younger        half-brother. One day a Rakshasa appears in the form        of a gigantic crane. The other princes shoot at it in        vain, but the youngest wounds it, and then sets off in        pursuit of it, and of the valuable arrow which is        fixed in it. After long wandering he comes to a castle        in a forest. There he finds a maiden who tells him she        is the daughter of the Rakshasa whom, in the form of a        crane, he has wounded. She at once takes his part        against her demon father, and eventually flies with        him to his own country. The perils which the fugitives        have to encounter will be mentioned in the remarks on        Skazka XIX. See Professor Brockhaus's summary of the        story in the \"Berichte der phil. hist. Classe der K.        Saechs. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften,\" 1861, pp.        223-6. Also Professor Wilson's version in his \"Essays        on Sanskrit Literature,\" vol. ii. pp. 134-5.          In two other stories in the same collection the hero        gives chase to a boar of gigantic size. It takes        refuge in a cavern into which he follows it. Presently        he finds himself in a different world, wherein he        meets a beauteous maiden who explains everything to        him. In the first of these two stories the lady is the        daughter of a Rakshasa, who is invulnerable except in        the palm of the left hand, for which reason, our hero,        Chandasena has been unable to wound him when in his        boar disguise. She instructs Chandasena how to kill        her father, who accordingly falls a victim to a        well-aimed shaft. (Brockhaus's \"Maehrchensammlung des        Somadeva Bhatta,\" 1843, vol. i. pp. 110-13). In the        other story, the lady turns out to be a princess whom        \"a demon with fiery eyes\" had carried off and        imprisoned. She tells the hero, Saktideva, that the        demon has just died from a wound inflicted upon him,        while transformed into a boar, by a bold archer.        Saktideva informs her that he is that archer.        Whereupon she immediately requests him to marry her        (ibid. vol. ii. p. 175). In both stories the boar is        described as committing great ravages in the upper        world until the hero attacks it.]    The Adventures of a prince, the youngest of three brothers, who has  been lowered into the underground world or who has ascended into an  enchanted upper realm, form the theme of numerous skazkas, several of  which are variants of the story of Norka. The prince's elder brothers  almost always attempt to kill him, when he is about to ascend from the  gulf or descend from the steeps which separate him from them. In one  instance, the following excuse is offered for their conduct. The hero  has killed a Snake in the underground world, and is carrying its head  on a lance, when his brothers begin to hoist him up. \"His brothers  were frightened at the sight of that head and thinking the Snake  itself was coming, they let Ivan fall back into the pit.\"[90] But this  apology for their behavior seems to be due to the story-teller's  imagination. In some instances their unfraternal conduct may be  explained in the following manner. In oriental tales the hero is often  the son of a king's youngest wife, and he is not unnaturally hated by  his half-brothers, the sons of an older queen, whom the hero's mother  has supplanted in their royal father's affections. Accordingly they do  their best to get rid of him. Thus, in one of the Indian stories which  correspond to that of Norka, the hero's success at court \"excited the  envy and jealousy of his brothers [doubtless half-brothers], "]]]
