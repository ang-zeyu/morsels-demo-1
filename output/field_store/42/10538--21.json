Mary Magdalene, which by the time of Charles II. had  become a ruin, and was pulled down in 1788. Its Norman doorway may be  seen in the Roman Catholic chapel in S. Peter's Street.    #Godfrey de Lucy# (1189-1204) was son of Richard de Lucy, Grand  Justiciary of England, and a great benefactor to the Priory of Lesnes in  Kent, founded by his father. De Lucy's work at Winchester is a fine  specimen of Early English architecture, and consists of what is known as  the retro-choir, where he was buried in accordance with the practice of  interring a founder amid his work. The large slab of grey marble without  inscription which marks his grave was, Willis tells us, \"by a slight  confusion of tradition\" pointed out by former vergers as the tomb of  King Lucius.    #Peter de la Roche# or de Rupibus (1204-1238) sprang from a knightly  family in Poitou, and was consecrated bishop of Winton at Rome in 1205.  He was a hot and unscrupulous partisan of King John, in spite of the  latter's scornful treatment of the church, and in 1214, when John had  submitted to Innocent III., Peter was made Grand Justiciary of England,  much against the wish of the English nobles. He became guardian of the  young Henry III., coming often into conflict with Henry de Burgh. Peter  was in many ways a type of the Norman ecclesiastic so hated by the  people, but, according to Matthew Paris, he fought bravely in the Holy  Land, whither he led a body of Crusaders in 1226. He founded the Domus  Dei at Portsmouth, some portions of which still exist in the \"Garrison  Chapel\"; and also the monastery at Selborne, described by Gilbert White.  He died at Farnham Castle in June 1238.    #William de Raleigh# (1244-1249) came from the see of Norwich to that of  Winchester. He was elected by the monks in 1238, but, as explained  elsewhere, it was six years before he gained possession, though  confirmed in his office by the Pope. He retired to France, then under  the rule of Louis IX., until Henry at length gave way. Raleigh, however,  did not live to enjoy his honours long, dying during a stay at Tours in  1249.    #Ethelmar# or Aymer de Valence (1250-1261), who succeeded him, was  half-brother of Henry III., being son of the Count of La Marche, who  married John's widow. As a native of Poitou, his appointment was as  unpopular as that of de Roches, and, moreover, he is said to have been  only an acolyte when Henry forced the monks to accept him as their  bishop. At first he was only styled \"bishop-elect\" of Winchester, and he  was not consecrated until Ascension Day 1260. Even before his  appointment we are told that his revenues exceeded those of the  Archbishop of Canterbury, and he was permitted to retain them. His  tyranny and greed provoked the Oxford Parliament in 1258 to expel him  from the kingdom and he fled to France, dying three years later in Paris  while on his return from Rome to England; for he had induced the Pope to  espouse his cause and consecrate him.    #John Of Exeter# or John Gervase (1265-1268) was appointed by the Pope  on the death of Aymer, in preference to two rivals whose election was  disputed. He is accused of having purchased his elevation. He assisted  the barons in the Civil War, and after Simon de Montfort's failure was  suspended and cited to appear at Rome, where he died.    #Nicholas of Ely# (1268-1280) had been lord chancellor and high  treasurer before he obtained Winchester. On his death he was buried at  Waverley Abbey, but an inscription on the wall of the south choir aisle  marks where his heart was interred in his cathedral.    #John de Pontissara#, Pontoise, or Sawbridge (1282-1304), nominated by  the Pope against the will of Edward I., at length made his peace by  paying a fine of 2000 marks and giving his manor of Swainstone, Isle of  Wight, to the king. He built a college of S. Elizabeth of Hungary at  Winchester. He had been Chancellor of Oxford University, though at the  time of his election he was Professor of Civil Law at Modena.    #Henry Woodlock# (1305-1316), former prior of S. Swithun's monastery,  who performed the coronation of Edward II.; #John Sandale# (1316-1319);  #Reginald Asser# (1320-1323); #John Stratford# (1323-1333), whose  election was opposed by the king, but who in the next reign was  translated to Canterbury--are not particularly noticeable.    #Adam Orleton# or de Orlton (1333-1345) was translated hither from  Worcester by the Pope against the king's wishes. He has the most  unenviable notoriety of having been the bishop of Hereford who  instigated the brutal murder of Edward II. on September 21, 1327. He had  been accused of high treason and deprived of Hereford, but was restored  thereto by the barons. Edward III. apparently at length received him  into favour; but Orleton went blind some years before his death. He is  buried in the Chapel of the Guardian Angels.    #William Edingdon# (1346-1366), though chiefly notable for his  architectural work at Winchester, was treasurer of England in 1350 and  chancellor seven years later. He might, had he wished it, have become  Archbishop of Canterbury, but preferred Winchester. He began the great  remodelling of the nave, and, dying before much of the work was done,  left certain property, as appears from his will, for carrying on the  work; though it is also said that a claim was made against his executors  with regard to the dilapidations of the see. His general reputation was,  as a biographer says, \"that he loved the king's advantage more than that  of the community.\" He founded a convent of \"Bonhommes\" at his native  village of Edingdon, in Wiltshire, where the church building, or rather  rebuilding, is due chiefly to him. He was buried in his own chantry in  the cathedral. His \"monkish epitaph,\" as Warner calls it, runs thus:      Edyndon natus Wilhelmus hic est tumulatus    Praesul praegratus, in Wintonia cathedratus.    Qui pertransitis, ejus memorare velitis.    Providus et mitis ausit cum mille peritis.    Pervigil Anglorum fuit adjutor populorum.    Dulcis egenorum pater et protector eorum.    MC tribus junctum post L.X.V. sit I punctum    Octava Sanctum notat hunc Octobris inunctum.    #William of Wykeham# (1367-1404), whose name has become so identified  with Winchester Cathedral and College, was probably a native of the  village of Wykeham, near Litchfield. Born in 1324, after education at  Winchester and Oxford he was in 1346 presented to the king, Edward III.,  at the age of twenty-three, \"with no other advantages than his skill in  architecture\" and \"the courtly attribute of a courtly person.\" In the  course of the next twenty-one years he rose rapidly, filling various  offices until he became Bishop of Winchester and Lord High Chancellor of  England. His first recorded appointment is to the clerkship of all the  king's works near Windsor, and in the same year he was surveyor of the  new buildings there, including the round tower and the eastern ward of  the Castle and a College to the west for the Order of the Garter,  occupying the site of the ancient Domus Regis, close to the present S.  George's Chapel. On one of the towers the inscription _This made  Wykeham_ may or may not be meant to convey a double meaning, but it is  certainly true that his architectural successes furthered his fortunes.  In 1357 he received the tonsure, and in 1360 was made Dean of S.  Martin's Le Grand, Archdeacon of Lincoln, Northampton, and Buckingham,  and Provost of Wells. In 1361 he commenced Queenborough Castle on the  island of Sheppey; this important edifice, covering over three acres of  ground, was demolished about 1650. The castles of Winchester,  Porchester, Wolvesey, Ledes, and Dover, with many others, are believed  to have been either entirely rebuilt, or at least enlarged, by him. He  was only ordained priest five years before his elevation to Winchester.  In 1394 he undertook the great reformation of the cathedral which is  dealt with in another part of this book. New College (Sainte Mary of  Wynchestre), Oxford, opened by Wykeham on April 14, 1386, effected  almost as great a revolution in university education as his famous  college at Winchester did for the training of boys. As Dr Ingram has  pointed out, the very title of \"New\" College which has clung to it shows  how completely a new collegiate system was established by its  foundation, which served as a model for future endowments. His  well-known motto--chosen when his growing dignity made it necessary for  him to possess armorial bearings--\"Manners Makyth Man\" has generally  been taken to mean that virtue alone is true nobility; Lord Campbell,  however, would have us rather interpret \"manners\" as the studied  etiquette of courts and the polished courtesy which Lord Chesterfield  held so important a factor in success. Willis styles it \"a somewhat  radical sentiment at the time.\" In his own day the secular arts Wykeham  practised did not meet with universal approval, for Wiclif alludes to  him when he observes, \"They wullen not present a clerk able of God's  word and holy ensample, but a kitchen clerk, or a penny clerk, or one  wise in building castles and other worldly doings.\" But despite this  objection, the whole of Wykeham's biographers, contemporary or  posthumous, agree in praising him as highly as Fuller, who says that his  \"benefaction to learning is not to be paralleled by any English subject  in all particulars,\" and his great innovation, whereby elementary  education was taken from the hands of the monks and, as in his own  college, established upon an entirely different plan, would alone stamp  him as one whose foresight was far beyond his own times. He influenced  the nation in a way not easy to over-estimate, inasmuch as he  originated, or at least carried into execution, the idea of the great  public school, as Englishmen understand it, and, by the building of  Winchester College, founded the institution he had long meditated in a  way worthy of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#17)"],[1," let me do some outdoor stuff. From  then on I did very well, and when I heard your company was going to make  a big war play, I applied to Mr. Pertell. He took me, I'm glad to say.\"    \"And we're glad you're here,\" ejaculated Alice.    \"We'll go out and watch you jump; it fascinates me, though it makes me  afraid,\" Ruth declared. \"My sister and I did some riding while we were  at Rocky Ranch, but it was nothing to what you do.\"    \"Oh, it takes practice, that's all,\" answered Estelle.    There were some animated scenes previous to the one in which Estelle  took part. There was a fight over the possession of a bridge, and the  Confederates, having driven off their enemies, prepared to blow it up to  prevent the Union army from using it.    Estelle was to try to reach the bridge before it was destroyed, but,  failing in that, she was to ride her horse to a narrow part of the  stream and leap over.    All went well, and the time came for her to take her swift ride to try  to reach the bridge. On and on she galloped, until she was met by a  colored man who warned her of the fact that in another moment the bridge  would be destroyed.    \"She's going pretty close!\" murmured Mr. Pertell, as he stood near Russ,  who was filming the scene. \"Some of those timbers may fall pretty near  her.\"    But Estelle seemed to know no fear. She rode straight for the bridge,  and she was only a short distance away when it blew up, the planks and  rails flying high into the air.    Then she turned her horse to reach, ahead of her pursuers, the place she  was to jump the stream. So near was she to the bridge that she had to  swerve her horse quickly to avoid being struck by a fragment of the  falling wood.    \"Plucky girl, that!\" murmured Mr. DeVere.    While Estelle was being filmed down by the stream, one of the assistant  camera men, a new hand, prepared to take a scene where a Southern farmer  rides up to warn the Confederate cavalry of Estelle's escape, so they  may take after her. Maurice Whitlow was the farmer.    \"Here, you!\" cried Mr. Pertell to Whitlow, \"ride down there and deliver  the message--that's your part in this scene.\"    There was a small automobile which Mr. Pertell had been using standing  near, and Maurice leaped into this and started across the field toward a  detachment of the Southern cavalry.    Away rattled Maurice in the car, and the camera man ground away, showing  the farmer on his way to give the warning. Suddenly Mr. Pertell turned  and saw what was going on.    \"For the love of gasoline, stop!\" he cried. \"The whole scene is spoiled.  There'll have to be a retake! Of all the stupid pieces of work this is  the worst! Stop that camera!\"          CHAPTER XVII    ESTELLE'S STORY      \"What's the matter?\" cried Russ Dalwood, running back from the stream  where he had been to see that an assistant was successfully getting the  scene after Estelle had leaped to the other bank.    \"Matter! Look!\" cried the director, and he pointed to Maurice, speeding  to carry his message in the small runabout.    \"Good-night!\" gasped Russ, who understood at once.    \"Why, what's wrong with it?\" asked Paul. \"Isn't he running the machine  all right?\"    \"Oh, he's running it all right,\" said Mr. Pertell in tones of disgust.  \"And that's just the trouble! I told him to jump on a horse with that  dispatch, and he goes in the auto!\"    \"I suppose he thought it was quicker,\" commented Paul.    \"Quicker! Yes, I should say it was! But I'll get him out of there  quicker than he can shake a stick at a dead mule. The idea of riding in  an auto to carry a message in Civil War days. Why, there wasn't a real  auto in the whole world then. How would it look in a film to see an  up-to-date runabout butting in on a scene of sixty-three. Get him back  here and make him start over again on a horse as he ought to,\" went on  the director. \"An auto in sixty-three! Next he'll be sending wireless  telephone messages about fifty years before they were ever dreamed of!\"    Fortunately, not much of the film had been reeled off, and the scene was  one that could easily be made over. Estelle's leap was not spoiled, nor  was the blowing up of the bridge.    \"Huh! I didn't think anything about there not being autos in those  days,\" said Maurice, when he had been brought back and mounted on a  horse.    \"That's just it,\" commented Mr. Pertell. \"You've got to think in these  days of moving pictures. The audiences are more critical than you would  suppose. Even the children now laugh at fake scenes and incongruities.  And as for using a dummy in danger scenes, it's getting harder and  harder every day to get by with it. You stick to horses or to Shank's  mules, young man, when it comes to transportation in this war film. No  autos where they are going to show in the film.\"    That was only one of the many details the director and his assistants  had to look after. If eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, it is  much more so the price of good films. The camera sees everything in a  pitiless light. It exaggerates faults and it refuses to shut its eye to  anything at which it is pointed. The absolute truth is told every time.    Of course, there are trick films, but even then the camera tells the  truth fearlessly. It is only the on-lookers' eyes that are deceived. The  camera can not be fooled. And though a man may be seen to be shaking  hands with himself or cutting off his own head, it is done by double  exposure, and could not be accomplished were it not for the fact that  the camera and the film are so fearlessly honest and truth-telling.    \"What's the matter, Estelle?\" asked Alice of the rider that afternoon,  when they were in Ruth's room resting after the work of the day. \"You  seem to be in pain.\"    \"I am. I strained my side a little in that water jump. Petro slipped a  bit on the muddy bank.\"    \"Did you do much jumping out West?\" asked Ruth, while Alice was getting  a bottle of liniment.    \"In the West? I don't know that I ever jumped there. I can't  remember----\"    Estelle paused, and passed her hand across her eyes as though to shut  out some vision.    \"Are you faint?\" asked Ruth.    \"No--no, it isn't that. It--it is just that I--that I---- Oh, I wonder  if I can tell you?\" and Estelle seemed in such distress that the two  sisters hastened to her.    \"What is it? Tell me, are you badly hurt?\" asked Ruth. For she had known  of performers who concealed injuries that they might not be laid off,  and so lose a day's work. \"What is the matter, Estelle?\"    \"It is my--my head.\"    \"Did you fall? I didn't hear them say anything about it!\" exclaimed  Alice.    \"No, it isn't that,\" and the girl looked from one sister to the other.  \"Oh, I wonder if I dare tell you?\"    \"If there is anything in which we can help you, tell us, by all means!\"  answered Ruth, warmly--sympathetically. \"But we don't want to force  ourselves----\"    \"Oh, no! It isn't that. I'm only wondering what you will think of me  afterward.\"    \"We shall love you just the same!\" cried impulsive Alice.    \"Don't be too sure. But I feel that I must tell some one. I have borne  all I can alone. It is getting to the point where I fear I shall scream  my secret to the cameras--or some one!\"    Then Estelle had a secret!    \"Do tell us. Perhaps we can help you--or perhaps my father can,\"  suggested Ruth.    \"I don't believe any one can help me,\" said Estelle. \"But at least it  will be a relief to tell it. I--I am living under false pretenses!\" she  blurted out desperately.    \"False pretenses!\" repeated Alice. At once her mind flashed back to Miss  Dixon's ring. Was it the taking of this that Estelle was hinting at? The  girl must have guessed what was in the mind of her hearers, for she  hastened to add:    \"Oh, it isn't anything disgraceful. It's just a misfortune. You remember  you have been asking me where I learned to ride--whether I didn't use to  live on a ranch--questions like that. Well, you must have noticed that I  didn't answer.\"    \"Yes, we did notice, and we spoke about it,\" said truthful Ruth.    \"We thought you didn't wish to tell,\" added Alice.    \"Wish to tell! Oh, my dears, I would have been only too glad to tell if  I could.\"    \"Why can't you?\" asked Ruth. \"Are you bound by some vow of secrecy? Is  it dangerous for you to reveal the past?\"    \"No, it is simply impossible!\"    \"Impossible!\" the two sisters exclaimed.    \"Yes, I can no more tell you what life I lived, where I lived, who I  was, or what I was doing, up to a time of about three or four years ago,  than I can fly.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Alice, puzzled.    \"Because the past--up to the time I named--is a perfect blank to me. My  mind refuses absolutely to tell me who I was or where I lived--who my  people were--anything of the past. My mind is like a blank sheet of  paper. I can remember nothing. Oh, isn't it awful!\" and she burst into  tears.          CHAPTER XVIII    \"WHAT CAN WE DO?\"      \"You poor dear!\" cried Alice, and she knelt down on the floor beside  Estelle and put her arms about the weeping girl. Ruth, too, with an  expression of sympathy, stroked the bowed head.    \"We want so much to help you,\" Ruth murmured.    \"Let me get you something,\" begged Alice. \"Some smelling salts--some  ammonia--shall I call any one--the doctor----?\"    \"No, I--I'll be all right presently,\" said Estelle in a broken voice.  \"Just let me alone a little while--I mean stay with me--talk to me--tell  me something. I want to get control of my nerves.\"    Ruth did not seem to know what to say, but Alice pulled a small bottle  from her pocket, and held it under Estelle's nose.    \"It's the loveliest new scent,\" she said. \"I bought a sample in town.\"    Estelle burst into a laugh, rather a hysterical laugh, it is true, but a  laugh nevertheless. It showed that the strain and tension were relaxing  to some extent.    \"Isn't it sweet?\" Alice asked.    \"It is, dear. Let me smell it again. It makes me feel better,\" and  Estelle"]]]
