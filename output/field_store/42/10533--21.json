Would the cry be answered by the low rumbling of the beast of burden or  the horrid bellow of the man-eater? Upon the answer to this question  hung the fate of the ape-man.    Pan-at-lee was listening intently to the sounds of the departing gryfs  as Tarzan led them cunningly from her, and when she was sure that they  were far enough away to insure her safe retreat she dropped swiftly  from the branches to the ground and sped like a frightened deer across  the open space to the foot of the cliff, stepped over the body of the  Tor-o-don who had attacked her the night before and was soon climbing  rapidly up the ancient stone pegs of the deserted cliff village. In the  mouth of the cave near that which she had occupied she kindled a fire  and cooked the haunch of venison that Tarzan had left her, and from one  of the trickling streams that ran down the face of the escarpment she  obtained water to satisfy her thirst.    All day she waited, hearing in the distance, and sometimes close at  hand, the bellowing of the gryfs which pursued the strange creature  that had dropped so miraculously into her life. For him she felt the  same keen, almost fanatical loyalty that many another had experienced  for Tarzan of the Apes. Beast and human, he had held them to him with  bonds that were stronger than steel--those of them that were clean and  courageous, and the weak and the helpless; but never could Tarzan claim  among his admirers the coward, the ingrate or the scoundrel; from such,  both man and beast, he had won fear and hatred.    To Pan-at-lee he was all that was brave and noble and heroic and, too,  he was Om-at's friend--the friend of the man she loved. For any one of  these reasons Pan-at-lee would have died for Tarzan, for such is the  loyalty of the simple-minded children of nature. It has remained for  civilization to teach us to weigh the relative rewards of loyalty and  its antithesis. The loyalty of the primitive is spontaneous,  unreasoning, unselfish and such was the loyalty of Pan-at-lee for the  Tarmangani.    And so it was that she waited that day and night, hoping that he would  return that she might accompany him back to Om-at, for her experience  had taught her that in the face of danger two have a better chance than  one. But Tarzan-jad-guru had not come, and so upon the following  morning Pan-at-lee set out upon her return to Kor-ul-JA.    She knew the dangers and yet she faced them with the stolid  indifference of her race. When they directly confronted and menaced her  would be time enough to experience fear or excitement or confidence. In  the meantime it was unnecessary to waste nerve energy by anticipating  them. She moved therefore through her savage land with no greater show  of concern than might mark your sauntering to a corner drug-store for a  sundae. But this is your life and that is Pan-at-lee's and even now as  you read this Pan-at-lee may be sitting upon the edge of the recess of  Om-at's cave while the JA and JATO roar from the gorge below and from  the ridge above, and the Kor-ul-lul threaten upon the south and the  Ho-don from the Valley of Jad-ben-Otho far below, for Pan-at-lee still  lives and preens her silky coat of jet beneath the tropical moonlight  of Pal-ul-don.    But she was not to reach Kor-ul-JA this day, nor the next, nor for many  days after though the danger that threatened her was neither Waz-don  enemy nor savage beast.    She came without misadventure to the Kor-ul-lul and after descending  its rocky southern wall without catching the slightest glimpse of the  hereditary enemies of her people, she experienced a renewal of  confidence that was little short of practical assurance that she would  successfully terminate her venture and be restored once more to her own  people and the lover she had not seen for so many long and weary moons.    She was almost across the gorge now and moving with an extreme caution  abated no wit by her confidence, for wariness is an instinctive trait  of the primitive, something which cannot be laid aside even momentarily  if one would survive. And so she came to the trail that follows the  windings of Kor-ul-lul from its uppermost reaches down into the broad  and fertile Valley of Jad-ben-Otho.    And as she stepped into the trail there arose on either side of her  from out of the bushes that border the path, as though materialized  from thin air, a score of tall, white warriors of the Ho-don. Like a  frightened deer Pan-at-lee cast a single startled look at these  menacers of her freedom and leaped quickly toward the bushes in an  effort to escape; but the warriors were too close at hand. They closed  upon her from every side and then, drawing her knife she turned at bay,  metamorphosed by the fires of fear and hate from a startled deer to a  raging tiger-cat. They did not try to kill her, but only to subdue and  capture her; and so it was that more than a single Ho-don warrior felt  the keen edge of her blade in his flesh before they had succeeded in  overpowering her by numbers. And still she fought and scratched and bit  after they had taken the knife from her until it was necessary to tie  her hands and fasten a piece of wood between her teeth by means of  thongs passed behind her head.    At first she refused to walk when they started off in the direction of  the valley but after two of them had seized her by the hair and dragged  her for a number of yards she thought better of her original decision  and came along with them, though still as defiant as her bound wrists  and gagged mouth would permit.    Near the entrance to Kor-ul-lul they came upon another body of their  warriors with which were several Waz-don prisoners from the tribe of  Kor-ul-lul. It was a raiding party come up from a Ho-don city of the  valley after slaves. This Pan-at-lee knew for the occurrence was by no  means unusual. During her lifetime the tribe to which she belonged had  been sufficiently fortunate, or powerful, to withstand successfully the  majority of such raids made upon them, but yet Pan-at-lee had known of  friends and relatives who had been carried into slavery by the Ho-don  and she knew, too, another thing which gave her hope, as doubtless it  did to each of the other captives--that occasionally the prisoners  escaped from the cities of the hairless whites.    After they had joined the other party the entire band set forth into  the valley and presently, from the conversation of her captors,  Pan-at-lee knew that she was headed for A-lur, the City of Light; while  in the cave of his ancestors, Om-at, chief of the Kor-ul-JA, bemoaned  the loss of both his friend and she that was to have been his mate.        8    A-lur    As the hissing reptile bore down upon the stranger swimming in the open  water near the center of the morass on the frontier of Pal-ul-don it  seemed to the man that this indeed must be the futile termination of an  arduous and danger-filled journey. It seemed, too, equally futile to  pit his puny knife against this frightful creature. Had he been  attacked on land it is possible that he might as a last resort have  used his Enfield, though he had come thus far through all these weary,  danger-ridden miles without recourse to it, though again and again had  his life hung in the balance in the face of the savage denizens of  forest, jungle, and steppe. For whatever it may have been for which he  was preserving his precious ammunition he evidently held it more sacred  even than his life, for as yet he had not used a single round and now  the decision was not required of him, since it would have been  impossible for him to have unslung his Enfield, loaded and fired with  the necessary celerity while swimming.    Though his chance for survival seemed slender, and hope at its lowest  ebb, he was not minded therefore to give up without a struggle. Instead  he drew his blade and awaited the oncoming reptile. The creature was  like no living thing he ever before had seen although possibly it  resembled a crocodile in some respects more than it did anything with  which he was familiar.    As this frightful survivor of some extinct progenitor charged upon him  with distended jaws there came to the man quickly a full consciousness  of the futility of endeavoring to stay the mad rush or pierce the  armor-coated hide with his little knife. The thing was almost upon him  now and whatever form of defense he chose must be made quickly. There  seemed but a single alternative to instant death, and this he took at  almost the instant the great reptile towered directly above him.    With the celerity of a seal he dove headforemost beneath the oncoming  body and at the same instant, turning upon his back, he plunged his  blade into the soft, cold surface of the slimy belly as the momentum of  the hurtling reptile carried it swiftly over him; and then with  powerful strokes he swam on beneath the surface for a dozen yards  before he rose. A glance showed him the stricken monster plunging madly  in pain and rage upon the surface of the water behind him. That it was  writhing in its death agonies was evidenced by the fact that it made no  effort to pursue him, and so, to the accompaniment of the shrill  screaming of the dying monster, the man won at last to the farther edge  of the open water to take up once more the almost superhuman effort of  crossing the last stretch of clinging mud which separated him from the  solid ground of Pal-ul-don.    A good two hours it took him to drag his now weary body through the  clinging, stinking muck, but at last, mud covered and spent, he dragged  himself out upon the soft grasses of the bank. A hundred yards away a  stream, winding its way down from the distant mountains, emptied into  the morass, and, after a short rest, he made his way to this and  seeking a quiet pool, bathed himself and washed the mud and slime from  his weapons,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20203"],[0,"Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (#17)"],[1,"I  had finished my distribution for the next day's work, for the little  jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back. But so  determin'd I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that  one night, when, having impos'd[56] my forms, I thought my day's work  over, one of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced to  pi,[57] I immediately distribut'd and composed it over again before I  went to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors, began to  give us character and credit; particularly, I was told, that mention  being made of the new printing-office at the merchants' Every-night  club, the general opinion was that it must fail, there being already  two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whom  you and I saw many years after at his native place, St. Andrew's in  Scotland) gave a contrary opinion: \"For the industry of that  Franklin,\" says he, \"is superior to anything I ever saw of the kind; I  see him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at work  again before his neighbors are out of bed.\" This struck the rest, and  we soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with  stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business.

[56] To arrange and lock up pages or columns of type in a      rectangular iron frame, ready for printing.        [57] Reduced to complete disorder.    I mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely,  tho' it seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my  posterity, who shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, when  they see its effects in my favour throughout this relation.    George Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to  purchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a  journeyman to us. We could not then employ him; but I foolishly let  him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and  might then have work for him. My hopes of success, as I told him, were  founded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford,  was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yet  was profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely  fail of good encouragement. I requested Webb not to mention it; but he  told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me,  published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb was to be  employ'd. I resented this; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet  begin our paper, I wrote several pieces of entertainment for  Bradford's paper, under the title of the Busy Body, which Breintnal  continu'd some months. By this means the attention of the publick was  fixed on that paper, and Keimer's proposals, which we burlesqu'd and  ridicul'd, were disregarded. He began his paper, however, and, after  carrying it on three quarters of a year, with at most only ninety  subscribers, he offered it to me for a trifle; and I, having been  ready some time to go on with it, took it in hand directly; and it  prov'd in a few years extremely profitable to me.    I perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though our  partnership still continu'd; the reason may be that, in fact, the  whole management of the business lay upon me. Meredith was no  compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober. My friends lamented my  connection with him, but I was to make the best of it.    [Illustration: \"I see him still at work when I go home from club\"]    Our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in  the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited  remarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor  Burnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,  occasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of, and  in a few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.    Their example was follow'd by many, and our number went on growing  continually. This was one of the first good effects of my having  learnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men, seeing  a newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen,  thought it convenient to oblige and encourage me. Bradford still  printed the votes, and laws, and other publick business. He had  printed an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,  blundering manner; we reprinted it elegantly and correctly, and sent  one to every member. They were sensible of the difference: it  strengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and they voted us  their printers for the year ensuing.    Among my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton, before  mentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seat in it.  He interested himself for me strongly in that instance, as he did in  many others afterward, continuing his patronage till his death.[58]        [58] I got his son once L500.--_Marg. note_.    Mr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him,  but did not press me. I wrote him an ingenuous letter of  acknowledgment, crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he  allow'd me, and as soon as I was able, I paid the principal with  interest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree  corrected.    But now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least  reason to expect. Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for our  printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to  advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a  hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd us  all. We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in  time, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our  hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters  must be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.    In this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never  forgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came  to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application  from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should  be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if  that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the  partnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in  the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our  discredit. These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace. I  told them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain'd  of the Meredith's fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I  thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done,  and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd in their  performance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I should then  think myself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.    Thus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,  \"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken  in this affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and me  what he would for you alone. If that is the case, tell me, and I will  resign the whole to you, and go about my business.\" \"No,\" said he, \"my  father has really been disappointed, and is really unable; and I am  unwilling to distress him farther. I see this is a business I am not  fit for. I was bred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come to  town, and put myself, at thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn a  new trade. Many of our Welsh people are going to settle in North  Carolina, where land is cheap. I am inclin'd to go with them, and  follow my old employment. You may find friends to assist you. If you  will take the debts of the company upon you; return to my father the  hundred pounds he has advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give  me thirty pounds and a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership,  and leave the whole in your hands.\" I agreed to this proposal: it was  drawn up in writing, sign'd, and seal'd immediately. I gave him what  he demanded, and he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sent  me next year two long letters, containing the best account that had  been given of that country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc.,  for in those matters he was very judicious. I printed them in the  papers, and they gave great satisfaction to the publick.    As soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because I  would not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of what  each had offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other; paid off  the company's debts, and went on with the business in my own name,  advertising that the partnership was dissolved. I think this was in or  about the year 1729.          VIII    BUSINESS SUCCESS AND FIRST  PUBLIC SERVICE      About this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,  only fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that  soon to be sunk.[59] The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition,  being against all paper currency, from an apprehension that it would  depreciate, as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all  creditors. We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on  the side of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum  struck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade, employment,  and number of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old  houses inhabited, and many new ones building: whereas I remembered  well, that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia,  eating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut Street, between  Second and Front streets,[60] with bills on their doors, \"To be let\"; "]]]
