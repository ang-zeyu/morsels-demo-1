Then when those shades were so far parted from us that they could  no more be seen, a new thought set itself within me, from which  many others and diverse were born; and I so strayed from one unto  another that, thus wandering, I closed my eyes, and transmuted my  meditation into dream.        CANTO XIX. Fourth Ledge: the Slothful--Dante dreams of the  Siren.--The Angel of the Pass.--Ascent to the Fifth Ledge.--Pope  Adrian V.      At the hour when the diurnal heat, vanquished by the Earth or  sometimes by Saturn,[1] can warm no more the coldness of the  moon,--when the geomancers see their Greater Fortune[2] in the  east, rising before the dawn along a path which short while stays  dark for it,--there came to me in dream[3] a woman stammering,  with eyes asquint, and crooked on her feet, with hands lopped  off, and pallid in her color. I gazed at her; and as the sun  comforts the cold limbs which the night bennmbs, so my look made  her tongue nimble, and then set her wholly straight in little  while, and so colored her wan face as love requires. Then, when  she had her speech thus unloosed, she began to sing, so that with  difficulty should I have turned my attention from her. \"I am,\"  she sang, \"I am the sweet Siren, and the mariners in mid sea  I bewitch, so full am I of pleasantness to hear. I turned Ulysses  from his wandering way by my song; and whoso abides with me  seldom departs, so wholly I content him.\"    [1] Toward dawn, when the warmth of the preceding day is  exhausted, Saturn was supposed to exert a frigid influence.    [2] \"Geomancy is divination by points in the ground, or pebbles  arranged in certain figures, which have peculiar names. Among  these is the figure called the Fortuna Major, which by an effort  of imagination can also be formed out of some of the last stars  of Aquarius and some of the first of Pisces.\" These are the signs  that immediately precede Aries, in which the Sun now was, and  the stars forming the figure of the Greater Fortune would be in  the east about two hours before sunrise.    [3] The hour when this dream comes to Dante is \"post mediam  noctem ... cum somnia vera,\"--the hour in which it was  commonly believed that dreams have a true meaning. The woman seen  by Dante is the deceitful Siren, who symbolizes the temptation to  those sins of sense from which the spirits are purified in the  three upper rounds of Purgatory.      Not yet was her mouth closed when at my side a Lady[1] appeared,  holy, and ready to make her confused. \"O Virgil, Virgil, who is  this?\" she sternly said; and he came with his eyes fixed only on  that modest one. She took hold of the other, and in front she  opened her, rending her garments, and showed me her belly; this  waked me with the stench that issued from it. I turned my eyes,  and the good Virgil said, \"At least three calls have I given  thee; arise and come; let us find the opening through which thou  mayst enter.\"    [1] This lady seems to be the type of the conscience, virtus  intellectualis, that calls reason to rescue the tempted soul.      Up I rose, and now were all the circles of the sacred mountain  full of the high day, and we went on with the new sun at our  backs. Following him, I bore my forehead like one who has it  laden with thought, and makes of himself the half arch of a  bridge, when I heard, \"Come ye! here is the passage,\" spoken in a  mode soft and benign, such as is not heard in this mortal region.  With open wings, which seemed of a swan, he who thus had spoken  to us turned us upward between the two walls of the hard rock. He  moved his feathers then, and fanned us, affirming qui lugent[1]  to be blessed, for they shall have their souls mistresses of  consolation.[2] \"What ails thee that ever on the ground thou  lookest?\" my Guide began to say to me, both of us having mounted  up a little from the Angel. \"With such apprehension a recent  vision makes me go, which bends me to itself so that I cannot  from the thought withdraw me.\" \"Hast thou seen,\" said he, \"that  ancient sorceress who above us henceforth is alone lamented? Hast  thou seen how from her man is unbound? Let it suffice thee, and  strike thy heels on the ground;[3] turn thine eyes to the lure  that the eternal King whirls with the great circles.\"    [1] \"They that mourn.\"    [2] The meaning seems to be, \"they shall be possessed of  comfort.\" Donne (i.e.\"mistresses ) is a rhyme-word, and affords  an instance of a straining of the meaning compelled by the rhyme.    [3] Hasten thy steps.      Like the falcon that first looks down, then turns at the cry, and  stretches forward, through desire of the food that draws him  thither; such I became, and such, so far as the rock is cleft to  afford a way to him who goeth up, did I go on as far as where the  circling[1] is begun. When I was come forth on the fifth round, I  saw people upon it who were weeping, lying upon the earth all  turned downward. \"Adhoesit pavimento anima mea,\"[2] I heard them  saying with such deep sighs that the words were hardly  understood. \"O elect of God, whose sufferings both justice and  hope make less hard, direct us toward the high ascents.\" \"If ye  come secure from the lying down, and wish to find the speediest  way, let your right hands always be outside.\" So prayed the Poet,  and so a little in front was replied to us by them; wherefore I,  in his speaking, marked the hidden one;[3] and then turned my  eyes to my Lord, whereon he granted me, with cheerful sign, that  which the look of my desire was asking for. Then when I could do  with myself according to my will, I drew me above that creature  whose words had first made me note him, saying, \"Spirit in whom  weeping matures that without which no one can turn to God,  suspend a little for me thy greater care. Tell me who thou wast;  and why ye have your backs turned upward; and if thou wishest  that I obtain aught for thee there whence I alive set forth.\" And  he to me, \"Thy heaven turns to itself our hinder parts thou shalt  know; but first, scias quod ego fui successor Petri.[4] Between  Sestri and Chiaveri[5] descends a beautiful stream,[6] and of its  name the title of my race makes its top.[7] One month and little  more I proved how the great mantle weighs on him who guards it  from the mire, so that all other burdens seem a feather. My  conversion, ah me! was tardy; but when I had become the Roman  Shepherd, then I found out the lying life. I saw that there the  heart was not at rest; nor was it possible to, mount higher in  that life; wherefore the love of this was kindled in me. Up to  that time a wretched soul and parted from God had I been,  avaricious of everything; now, as thou seest, I am punished for  it here. That which avarice doth is displayed here in the  purgation of these converted souls, and the Mountain has no more  bitter penalty.[8] Even as our eye, fixed upon earthly things,  was not lifted on high, so justice here to earth has depressed  it. As avarice, in which labor is lost, quenched our love for  every good, so justice here holds us close, bound and captive in  feet and hands; and, so long as it shall be the pleasure of the  just Lord, so long shall we stay immovable and outstretched.\"    [1] The level of the fifth round.    [2] \"My soul cleaveth to the dust.\"-- Psalm cxix. 25.    [3] The face of the speaker, turned to the ground, was concealed.    [4] \"Know that I was a successor of Peter.\" This was the Pope  Adrian V., Ottobono de' Fieschi, who died in 1276, having been  Pope for thirty-eight days.    [5] Little towns on the Genoese sea-coast.    [6] The Lavagna, from which stream the Fieschi derived their  title of Counts of Lavagna.    [7] Its chief boast.    [8] Others may be greater, but none more humiliating.      I had knelt down and wished to speak; but when I began, and he  became aware, only by listening, of my reverence, \"What cause,\"  said he, \"hath bent thee thus downward?\" And I to him, \"Because  of your dignity my conscience stung me for standing.\" \"Straighten  thy legs, and lift thee up, brother,\" he replied; \"err not,  fellow servant of one power am I with thee and with the rest.[1]  If ever thou hast understood that holy gospel sound which says  neque nubent,[2] thou mayst well see why I speak thus. Now go thy  way. I will not that thou longer stop; for thy stay hinders my  weeping, with which I ripen that which thou hast said. A  grandchild I have on earth who is named Alagia,[3] good in  herself, if only our house make her not wicked by example; and  she alone remains to me yonder.\"[4]    [1] And I fell at His feet to worship him. And He said unto me,  See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant.\"--Revelation xix.  10.    [2] They neither marry.\"--Matthew, xxii. 80. The distinctions of  earths do not exist in the spiritual world.    [3] Alagia was the wife of the Marquis Moroello Malaspina. See  the close of Canto VIII. Dante had probably seen her in 1306,  when he was a guest of the house, in the Lunigiana.    [4] Not that she was his only living relative, but the only one  whose prayers, coming from a good heart, would avail him.        CANTO XX. Fifth Ledge: the Avaricious.--The Spirits celebrate  examples of Poverty and Bounty.--Hugh Capet.--His discourse on  his descendants.--Trembling of the Mountain.    Against a better will the will fights ill: wherefore against my  own pleasure, in order to please him, I drew from the water the  sponge not full.    I moved on, and my Leader moved on through the space vacant only  alongside of the rock, as upon a wall one goes close to the  battlements. For on the other side the people, that through their  eyes are pouring drop by drop the evil that possesses all the  world, approach too near the edge.[1]    [1]Too close to leave a space for walking.

Therefore gaze upon the  arms of the Cross; he, whom I shall name, will there do that  which within a cloud its own swift fire does.\" At the naming of  Joshua, even as he did it, I saw a light drawn over the Cross;  nor was the word noted by me before the act. And at the name of  the lofty Maccabeus[1] I saw another move revolving, and gladness  was the whip of the top. Thus for Charlemagne and for Roland my  attentive gaze followed two of them, as the eye follows its  falcon as be flies. Afterward William, and Renouard,[2] and the  duke Godfrey,[3] and Robert Guiscard[4] drew my sight over that  Cross. Then, moving, and mingling among the other lights, the  soul which had spoken with me showed me how great an artist it  was among the singers of heaven.    [1] Judas Maccabeus, who \" was renowned to the utmost part of the  earth.\" See I Maccabees, ii-ix.    [2] Two heroes of romance, paladins of Charlemagne.    [3] Godfrey of Bouillon, the leader of the first crusade.    [4] The founder of the Norman kingdom of Naples.      I turned me round to my right side to see my duty signified in  Beatrice either by speech or by act, and I saw her eyes so clear,  so joyous, that her semblance surpassed her other and her latest  wont. And even as, through feeling more delight in doing good, a  man from day to day becomes aware that his virtue is advancing,  so I became aware that my circling round together with the heaven  had increased its are, seeing that miracle more adorned. And such  as is the change, in brief passage of time, in a pale lady, when  her countenance is unlading the load of bashfulness, such was  there in my eyes, when I had turned, because of the whiteness of  the temperate sixth star which had received, me within itself.[1]  I saw, within that torch of Jove, the sparkling of the love which  was there shape out our speech to my eyes. And as birds, risen  from the river-bank, as if rejoicing together over their food,  make of themselves a troop now round, now of some other shape, so  within the lights[2] holy creatures were singing as they flew,  and made of themselves now D, now I, now L, in their proper  shapes.[3] First, singing, they moved to their melody, then  becoming one of these characters, they stopped a little, and  were silent.    [1] The change is from the red light of Mars to the white light  of Jupiter, a planet called by astrologers the \"temperate\" star,  as lying between the heat of Mars and the coldness of Saturn.    [2] The sparkles of the love which was there.    [3] The first letters of Diligite, as shortly appears.      O divine Pegasea,[1] who makest the wits of men glorious, and  renderest them long-lived, as they, through thee, the cities and  the kingdoms, illume me with thyself that I may set in relief  their shapes, as I have conceived them I let thy power appear in  these brief verses!    [1] An appellation appropriate to any one of the Muses (whose  fountain Hippocrene sprang at the stamp of Pegasus); here  probably applied to Urania, already once invoked by the poet  (Purgatory, XXIX.).      They showed themselves then in five times seven vowels and  consonants; and I noted the parts as they seemed spoken to me.  Diligite justitiam were first verb and noun of all the picture;  qui judicatis terram[1] were the last. Then in the M of the fifth  word they remained arranged, so that Jove seemed silver patterned  there with gold. And I saw other lights descending where the top  of the M was, and become quiet there, singing, I believe, the  Good which moves them to itself. Then, as on the striking of  burnt logs rise innumerable sparks, wherefrom the foolish are  wont to draw auguries, there seemed to rise again thence more  than a thousand lights, and mount, one much and one little,  according as the Sun which kindles them allotted them; and, each  having become quiet in its place, I saw the head and the neck of  an eagle represented by that patterned fire. He who paints there,  has none who may guide Him, but Himself guides, and by Him is  inspired that virtue which is form for the nests.[2] The rest of  the blessed spirits, which at first seemed content to be  enlilied[3] on the M, with a slight motion followed out the  imprint.    [1] \"Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth.\"--  Wisdom of Solomon, i. 1.    [2] The words are obscure; they may mean that a virtue, or  instinct, similar to that which teaches the bird to build its  nest, directed the shaping of these letters.    [3] Ingigliare, a word invented by Dante, and used only by him.  The meaning is that these spirits seemed first to form a lily on  the M.      O sweet star, how great gems and how many showed to me that our  justice is the effect of that heaven which thou ingemmest!  Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which thy motion and thy virtue  have their source, that It regard whence issues the smoke which  spoils thy radiance, so that now a second time It may be wroth at  the buying and selling within the temple which was walled with  signs and martyrdoms. O soldiery of the Heaven on which I gaze,  pray ye for those who are on earth all gone astray after the bad  example! Of old it was the wont to make war with swords, but now  it is made by taking, now here now there, the bread which the  piteous Father locks up from none.    But thou that writest only in order to cancel,[1] bethink thee  that Peter and Paul, who died for the vineyard which thou art  laying waste, are still alive. Thou mayest indeed say, \"I have my  desire set so on him who willed to live alone, and for a dance  was dragged to martyrdom[2] that I know not the Fisherman nor  Paul.\"    [1] The Pope, who writes censures, excommunications, and the  like, only that he may be paid to cancel thorn.    [2] The image of St. John Baptist was on the florin, which was  the chief object of desire of the Pope.        CANTO XIX. The voice of the Eagle.--It speaks of the mysteries of  Divine justice; of the necessity of Faith for salvation; of the  sins of certain kings.    The beautiful image, which in its sweet fruition was making  joyful the interwoven souls, appeared before me with outspread  wings. Each soul appeared a little ruby on which a ray of the sun  glowed so enkindled that it reflected him into My eyes. And that  which it now behoves me to describe, no voice ever reported, nor  ink wrote, nor was it ever conceived by the fancy; for I saw,  and also heard the beak speaking, and uttering with the voice  both I and MY, when in conception it was WE and OUR.[1]    [1] An image of the concordant will of the Just, and of the unity  of Justice under the Empire.      And it began, \"Through being just and pious am I here exalted  to that glory which lets not itself be conquered by desire; and  on earth I left my memory such that the evil people there commend  it, but continue not its story.\" Thus a single heat makes itself  felt from many embers, even as from many loves a single sound  issued from that image. Wherefore I thereon, \"O perpetual flowers  of the eternal gladness, which make all your odors seem to me as  only one, deliver me, by your breath, from the great fast which  has held me long in hunger, not finding for it any food on earth.  Well I know that if the Divine Justice makes any realm in heaven  its mirror, yours does not apprehend it through a veil.[1] Ye  know how intently I address myself to listen; ye know what is  that doubt[2] which is so old a fast to me.\"    [1] Here, if anywhere, the Divine Justice is reflected.    [2] Concerning the Divine justice.      As a falcon which, issuing from his hood, moves his head, and  claps his wings, showing desire, and making himself fine; so I  saw this ensign, which was woven of praise of the Divine Grace,  become, with songs such as he knows who thereabove rejoices. Then  it began, \"He who turned the compasses at the verge of the  world, and distributed within it so much occult and manifest,  could not so imprint His Power on all the universe that His Word  should not remain in infinite excess.[1] And this makes certain  that the first proud one, who was the top of every creature,  through not awaiting light, fell immature.[2] And hence it  appears, that every lesser nature is a scant receptacle for that  Good which has no end and measures Itself by Itself. Wherefore  our vision, which needs must be some ray of the Mind with which  all things are full, cannot in its own nature be so potent that  it may not discern its origin to be far beyond that which is  apparent to it.[3] Therefore the sight which your world  receives[4] penetrates into the eternal justice as the eye into  the sea; which, though from the shore it can see the bottom, on  the ocean sees it not, and nevertheless it is there, but the  depth conceals it. There is no light but that which comes from  the serene which is never clouded; nay, there is darkness,  either shadow of the flesh, or its poison.[5] The hiding place is  now open enough to thee, which concealed from thee the living  Justice concerning which thou madest such frequent question;[6]  for thou saidest,--'A man is born on the bank of the Indus, and  no one is there who may speak of Christ, nor who may read, nor  who may write; and all his wishes and acts are good so far as  human reason sees, without sin in life or in speech. He dies  unbaptized, and without faith: where is this Justice which  condemns him? where is his sin if he does not believe?' Now who  art thou, that wouldst sit upon a bench to judge a thousand miles  away with the short vision of a single span? Assuredly, for him  who subtilizes with me,[7] if the Scripture were not above you,  there would be occasion for doubting to a marvel. Oh earthly  animals! oh gross minds![8]    "]]]
