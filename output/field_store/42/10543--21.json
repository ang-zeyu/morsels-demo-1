[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#17)"],[1," hit upon by hasty  induction, then erected into a principle and imposed upon the facts. No  more than Goethe did he extract his principle from a sufficient mass of  data.    Now he found his theory to be in its pure form unworkable; he found, for  example, that the skeleton of fishes could not be compared directly,  bone for bone, with the skeleton of higher Vertebrates; he had to admit  differences of position of whole sets of organs in the two groups, he  had to admit various _metastases_, before he could bring the skeleton of  fish into line. And these metastases are due to functional  requirements--for example, the forward position of sternum and thoracic  organs in fish is an adaptation to swimming.    So he does not so much demonstrate the unity of plan of whole organisms  as the unity of plan of particular corresponding parts of them. Thus he  does not prove or attempt to prove that Articulates are in all points  like Vertebrates, but simply that their skeleton is built upon the same  plan as that of Vertebrates. The rest of the organs, while still  comparable with the organs of Vertebrates, stand in different relations  to the skeleton. An Articulate therefore, on his own showing, is not,  _as a whole_, built upon the same general structural plan as a  Vertebrate.    Further, he does not always remain true to his principles, for he does  not establish homologies of parts entirely by their connections but  sometimes by their functions as well. Thus the sternum, or rather the  complex of sternal elements, is defined and discovered in particular  cases not by its connections only but also by its functions. The  framework of the gills is homologised part by part with the framework of  the lungs, not because the relations of the framework to the rest of the  skeleton are the same in fish and air-breathing Vertebrates, but simply  because gills are considered the equivalents of lungs--a comparison  which is purely physiological.    Even with these concessions to the functional view of living things,  Geoffroy was unable to make good his contention that all animals are  built upon the same plan. His arguments failed to carry conviction to  his contemporaries, and Cuvier in particular subjected them to  destructive, and indeed final, criticism.    The paper, already referred to, in which Cuvier disposed of the  transcendentalists' comparison of Cephalopods and Vertebrates is of  great significance, for it states in the clearest way the radical  opposition between the functional and the formal attitudes to living  things.    Cuvier points out that if by unity of composition is meant identity,  then the statement that all animals show the same composition is simply  not true--compare a polyp with a man!--on the other hand, if by unity is  meant simply resemblance or homology, the statement is true within  certain limits, but it has been employed as a principle since the days  of Aristotle, and the theory of unity of composition is original only in  so far as it is false. He admits, however, that Geoffroy has seized upon  many hidden homologies, especially by his valuable discovery of the  importance of foetal structure. In all this Cuvier is undoubtedly right.  Unity of plan and composition, as Geoffroy conceived it, simply does not  exist. Cuvier goes on to say that this principle of Geoffroy's, in the  greatly modified form in which it can be accepted, and has been accepted  from the dawn of zoology, is not the sole and unique principle of the  science. On the contrary, it is merely a subordinate principle,  subordinate to a higher and more fruitful principle, that, namely, of  the conditions of existence, of the adaptation (_convenance_) of the  parts, of the co-ordination of the parts for the role which the animal  is to play in Nature. \"That is the true philosophical principle,\" he  says, \"whence may be deduced the possibility of certain resemblances,  the impossibility of certain others; it is the rational principle from  which follows the principle of the unity of plan and composition, and in  which at the same time it finds those limits, which some would like to  disregard\" (p. 248).    Geoffroy's position is the direct contrary. He holds that the principle  of the unity of plan and composition is the true base of natural  history,[117] and that this unity limits the possible transformations of  the organism. Thus, speaking of the influence of the respiratory medium,  he says, \"All the same this influence of the external world, if it has  ever become a cause which disturbed organisation, must necessarily have  been confined within fairly narrow limits; animals must have opposed to  it certain conditions inherent to their nature, the existence of the  same materials composing them, and a manifest tendency to resemble one  another, and to reproduce invariably the same primordial type.\"[118] Unity  of plan and composition is, on this view, prior to adaptation and limits  adaptation. Cuvier's view, on the contrary, is that the necessity of  functional and ecological adaptation accounts for the repetition of the  same types of structure. There are, of all the possible combinations of  organs, only a few viable types--those whose structure is adapted to  their life. Therefore it is reasonable that these few types should be  repeated in innumerable exemplars. One must remember, in order to  appreciate Cuvier's view, that he was not obsessed, as we are, by the  idea of evolution.    Cuvier thought in terms of organs, not in terms of \"materials of  organisation.\" He held that the resemblances between the organs of one  class of animals and the organs of another were due to the similarity of  their functions. \"Let us conclude, then, that if there are resemblances  between the organs of fish and those of other classes, it is only in the  measure that there is a resemblance between their functions.\"[119] There  are only a few kinds of organs, each adapted for a particular function,  and these organs are necessarily repeated from class to class.--\"As the  animal kingdom has received only a limited number of organs, it is  inevitable that some at least of these organs should be common to  several classes.\"[120]    Geoffroy thought in terms of \"materials,\" of parts of indefinite  function, parts which might take on any function. He insists upon the  necessity of disregarding function when tracing out the unity of  composition. He considers, in direct opposition to Cuvier's  interpretation of structural resemblance as due to similarity of  function, that unity of composition is the primary fact, and similarity  of function subsidiary. In his reply in the _Mammiferes_ (1829) to  Cuvier's criticisms in the _Histoire naturelle des Poissons_ (1828), he  insists on the necessity of excluding function from consideration in any  truly philosophical treatment of comparative anatomy (Discours prel., p.  25). Cuvier held that function determined structure, or at least that  the necessity of adaptation ruled the transformations of form. Geoffroy  considered that structure determined function, that changes of  structure, however they might arise, caused changes of function.  \"Animals,\" he writes, \"have no habits but those that result from the  structure of their organs; if the latter varies, there vary in the same  manner all their springs of action, all their faculties and all their  actions.\"[121]    Again, \"a vegetarian regime is imposed upon the Quadrumana by their  possession of a somewhat ample stomach, and intestines of moderate  length.\"[122] The hand of the bat has become so modified as to constrain  the bat to live in the air.[123]    The best example of Geoffroy's insistence upon the priority of structure  to function, and so of his purely morphological attitude, is perhaps his  interpretation, already alluded to, of the appendages of Articulates.  The segments of the Articulate are, he says, the equivalents of the  bodies of the vertebrae of higher forms. Now \"from the circumstance that  the vertebra is external, it results that the ribs must be so too; and,  as it is impossible that organs of such a size can remain passive and  absolutely functionless, these great arms, hanging there continually at  the disposition of the animal, are pressed into the service of  progression, and become its efficient instruments.\"[124] The ribs become  locomotory appendages.    We may compare the similar thought that the ear ossicles are simply  opercular bones reduced and turned to other uses.    Geoffroy could not but recognise the correlation of structure to  function, for this is a fact which imposes itself upon every observer.  He recognised also correlation between functions, as when he pointed out  the connection between increased respiration and enhanced muscular  activity in birds.[125] He interpreted structure at times in terms of  function, the short, strong clavicle of the mole as an adaptation to  digging, the keeled sternum of birds as an adaptation to flying, and so  on. But we may say that his whole tendency was to disregard function, to  look upon it as subsidiary. He protests against arguing from function  and habits to structure, as an \"abuse of final causes.\"[126] He was not so  convinced as Cuvier was of the all-importance of functional correlation;  in this view he was probably confirmed by his work on teratology. It did  not surprise him that Insects, in which lungs, heart and circulation  have disappeared(!), should yet have a skeleton built upon the same plan  as the skeleton of Vertebrates, which possess these organs; the  correlation of organ-systems is not so close as to prevent this.[127] So  too, although the other organs of the insect are all inside the body of  the vertebrae, they are yet comparable with the organs of Vertebrates.[128]  The existence of rudimentary organs also seemed to him an argument  against too strict a correlation of parts.

Anthony Scrapbook, Library of Congress. In 1890, after  visiting the John Brown Memorial at North Elbe, New York, Susan B.  Anthony wrote: \"John Brown was crucified for doing what he believed  God commanded him to do, 'to break the yoke and let the oppressed go  free,' precisely as were the saints of old for following what they  believed to be God's commands. The barbarism of our government was by  so much the greater as our light and knowledge are greater than those  of two thousand years ago.\" Harper, _Anthony_, II, p. 708.          THE TRUE WOMAN      Susan's preoccupation with antislavery work did not lessen her  interest in women's advancement. Her own expanding courage and ability  showed her the possibilities for all women in widened horizons and  activities. These possibilities were the chief topic of conversation  when she and Elizabeth Stanton were together. With Mrs. Stanton's  young daughters, Margaret and Harriot, in mind, they were continually  planning ways and means of developing the new woman, or the \"true  woman\" as they liked to call her; and one of these ways was physical  exercise in the fresh air, which was almost unheard of for women  except on the frontier.    Taking off her hoops and working in the garden in the freedom of her  long calico dress, Susan was refreshed and exhilarated. \"Uncovered the  strawberry and raspberry beds ...\" her diary records. \"Worked with  Simon building frames for the grapevines in the peach orchards.... Set  out 18 English black currants, 22 English gooseberries and Muscatine  grape vines.... Finished setting out the apple trees & 600 blackberry  bushes....\"[90]    She knew how little this strengthening work and healing influence  touched the lives of most women. Hemmed in by the walls of their  homes, weighed down by bulky confining clothing, fed on the tradition  of weakness, women could never gain the breadth of view, courage, and  stamina needed to demand and appreciate emancipation. She thought a  great deal about this and how it could be remedied, and wrote her  friend, Thomas Wentworth Higginson \"The salvation of the race depends,  in a great measure, upon rescuing women from their hot-house  existence. Whether in kitchen, nursery or parlor, all alike are shut  away from God's sunshine. Why did not your Caroline Plummer of Salem,  why do not all of our wealthy women leave money for industrial and  agricultural schools for girls, instead of ever and always providing  for boys alone?\"[91]    An exceptional opportunity was now offered Susan--to speak on the  controversial subject of coeducation before the State Teachers'  Association, which only a few years before had been shocked by the  sound of a woman's voice. Deeply concerned over her ability to write  the speech, she at once appealed to Elizabeth Stanton, \"Do you please  mark out a plan and give me as soon as you can....\"[92]    [Illustration: Susan B. Anthony, 1856]    Busy with preparations for woman's rights meetings in popular New York  summer resorts, Saratoga Springs, Lake George, Clifton Springs, and  Avon, she grew panicky at the prospect of her impending speech and  dashed off another urgent letter to Mrs. Stanton, underlining it  vigorously for emphasis: \"Not a _word written_ ... and mercy only  knows when I can get a moment, and what is _worse_, as the _Lord knows  full well_, is, that if _I get all the time the world has--I can't get  up a decent document_.... It is of but small moment who writes the  Address, but of _vast moment_ that it be _well done_.... No woman but  you can write from _my standpoint_ for all would base their strongest  _argument_ on the _un_likeness of the _sexes_....    \"Those of you who have the _talent_ to do honor to poor, oh how poor  womanhood have all given yourselves over to _baby_-making and left  poor brainless _me_ to battle alone. It is a shame. Such a lady as _I  might_ be _spared_ to _rock cradles_, but it is a crime for _you_ and  _Lucy_ and _Nette_.\"[93]    On a separate page she outlined for Mrs. Stanton the points she wanted  to make. Her title was affirmative, \"Why the Sexes Should be Educated  Together.\" \"Because,\" she reasoned, \"by such education they get true  ideas of each other.... Because the endowment of both public and  private funds is ever for those of the male sex, while all the  Seminaries and Boarding Schools for Females are left to  maintain themselves as best they may by means of their tuition  fees--consequently cannot afford a faculty of first-class  professors.... Not a school in the country gives to the girl equal  privileges with the boy.... No school _requires_ and but very few  allow the _girls_ to declaim and discuss side by side with the boys.  Thus they are robbed of half of education. The grand thing that is  needed is to give the sexes _like motives_ for acquirement. Very  rarely a person studies closely, without hope of making that knowledge  useful, as a means of support....\"[94]    Mrs. Stanton wrote her at once, \"Come here and I will do what I can to  help you with your address, if you will hold the baby and make the  puddings.\"[95] Gratefully Susan hurried to Seneca Falls and together  they \"loaded her gun,\" not only for the teachers' convention but for  all the summer meetings.    Addressing the large teachers' meeting in Troy, Susan declared that  mental sex-differences did not exist. She called attention to the  ever-increasing variety of occupations which women were carrying on  with efficiency. There were women typesetters, editors, publishers,  authors, clerks, engravers, watchmakers, bookkeepers, sculptors,  painters, farmers, and machinists. Two hundred and fifty women were  serving as postmasters. Girls, she insisted, must be educated to earn  a living and more vocations must be opened to them as an incentive to  study. \"A woman,\" she added, \"needs no particular kind of education to  be a wife and mother anymore than a man does to be a husband and  father. A man cannot make a living out of these relations. He must  fill them with something more and so must women.\"[96]    Her advanced ideas did not cause as much consternation as she had  expected and she was asked to repeat her speech at the Massachusetts  teachers' convention; but the thoughts of many in that audience were  echoed by the president when he said to her after the meeting, \"Madam,  that was a splendid production and well delivered. I could not have  asked for a single thing different either in matter or manner; but I  would rather have followed my wife or daughter to Greenwood cemetery  than to have had her stand here before this promiscuous audience and  deliver that address.\"[97]    It was one thing to talk about coeducation but quite another to offer  a resolution putting the New York State Teachers' Association on  record as asking all schools, colleges, and universities to open their  doors to women. This Susan did at their next convention, and while  there were enough women present to carry the resolution, most of them  voted against it, listening instead to the emotional arguments of a  group of conservative men who prophesied that coeducation would  coarsen women and undermine marriage. Nor did she forget the Negro at  these conventions, but brought much criticism upon herself by offering  resolutions protesting the exclusion of Negroes from public schools,  academies, colleges, and universities.    Such controversial activities were of course eagerly reported in the  press, and Henry Stanton, reading his newspaper, pointed them out to  his wife, remarking drily, \"Well, my dear, another notice of Susan.  You stir up Susan and she stirs up the world.\"[98]           *       *       *       *       *    The best method of arousing women and spreading new ideas, Susan  decided, was holding woman's rights conventions, for the discussions  at these conventions covered a wide field and were not limited merely  to women's legal disabilities. The feminists of that day extolled  freedom of speech, and their platform, like that of antislavery  conventions, was open to anyone who wished to express an opinion.  Always the limited educational opportunities offered to women were  pointed out, and Oberlin College and Antioch, both coeducational, were  held up as patterns for the future. Resolutions were passed, demanding  that Harvard and Yale admit women. Women's low wages and the very few  occupations open to them were considered, and whether it was fitting  for women to be doctors and ministers. At one convention Lucy Stone  made the suggestion that a prize be offered for a novel on women,  like _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, to arouse the whole nation to the unjust  situation of women whose slavery, she felt, was comparable to that of  the Negro. At another, William Lloyd Garrison maintained that women  had the right to sit in the Congress and in state legislatures and  that there should be an equal number of men and women in all national  councils. Inevitably Scriptural edicts regarding woman's sphere were  thrashed out with Antoinette Brown, in her clerical capacity, setting  at rest the minds of questioning women and quashing the"]]]
