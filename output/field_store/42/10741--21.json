Best French gelatine 1 part,       Glycerine 6 parts,       Water 6 parts,       Soak the gelatine in the water until swollen, then heat and add     the glycerine, add a few drops of a saturated solution of carbolic     acid, and filter hot through white blotting-paper;    6. A thick white varnish made by mixing oxide of zinc with copal     varnish in a mortar.    The eyeball is placed, immediately after excision, unopened, in  Mueller's Fluid for about three weeks, light being carefully excluded.  It is then frozen solid by immersion for a few minutes in a mixture of  finely powdered ice and salt, and immediately divided into lateral  halves by means of a sharp-edged table-knife. The portion to be  mounted is then placed in chloral solution for some weeks, in order to  remove the yellow colour; light being still excluded, and the fluid  being changed until it is no longer discoloured by the bichromate. The  specimen next lies for twenty-four hours or longer in the weaker  glycerine solution, and is then transferred for a similar period to  the stronger glycerine solution, after which it may be mounted in the  jelly without danger of shrinking. A specimen-jar being two-thirds  filled with melted jelly, the half-eye is placed in it, the concavity  upwards. When every interstice is filled, it is turned over (care  being taken to avoid the inclusion of an air-bubble), and held in a  central position in contact with the bottom of the jar. When cold and  firmly coagulated, the jelly is coated over with white varnish. A few  days later, when the surface of the varnish is firm, this again is  thinly coated with a film of jelly, and thereby preserved from the  ultimate danger of cracking. The jar is fixed with glue into a  suitable wooden stand. The gelatine which yields the strongest and  most colourless jelly is that manufactured by Coignet and Co, of  Paris, obtainable in packets, and known as the \"gold-label\" variety.  The specimen-jars, admirable both as to material and workmanship, have  been made expressly for me by Messrs. F. and C. Osler, of Broad  Street, Birmingham, from whom they may be obtained in any  number.--PRIESTLEY SMITH, Birmingham.    Glycerine retards fermentation and decomposition to a remarkable  degree. It combines readily with alcohol or water.    Boracic acid in small quantities mixed with a solution of saltpetre,  i.e, 1 to 50, is stated to be of service in the preservation of flesh.    Previously salted meat cannot be preserved this way; salting evidently  removes the phosphates. Action of boracic acid would, no doubt, set up  acid phosphates, which are the prime causes of the preservation.    A preparation of borax has been brought out by Mr. Robottom, of  Birmingham, who claims for it that it preserves all animal and  vegetable tissue, as well as being useful for tanning skins. I shall  refer to this preparation further on. Carbolic acid (pure) will be  found a valuable ally of the taxidermist. Calvert was the chief if not  the only maker of the pure preparation, which is sold in 0.5 lb. or 1  lb. bottles in a solid crystalline state, as if it were frozen. The  bottle, with the stopper temporarily removed, must be plunged in  boiling water to melt out as much as is required, to which must be  added many times its weight or quantity of water. This diluted  preparation will be found of infinite service in the hot summer months  for pouring in the \"gentle\" infested throats or wounds of mammals and  birds preparatory to skinning. Diluted and poured on a little burnt  alum or pure tannin, and the mixture well shaken together, it forms an  exceedingly strong preparation, as well as a valuable one, for  painting the noses or pickling the tongues of animals before or after  skinning. Two strengths of this will be found very useful. Thus:    No. 15--Carbolic Wash, No. 1 (for Mammals).    Glacial carbolic acid,             2 oz.    Burnt alum or pure tannin,         1 oz.    Water,                             1 pint.    Keep in stoppered bottle labelled \"Poison,\" and shake up before using.    No. 16.--Carbolic Wash, No. 2 (for Birds).    Glacial carbolic acid, 1 oz.    Water, 1 pint.    Keep in stoppered bottle labelled \"Poison,\" and shake before using.  Carbolic acid is a caustic poison, and therefore must be handled  carefully.    It sometimes happens that the taxidermist, if in a large way of  business, is called upon to destroy the insects infesting, it may be,  the entire collection of heads or skins hanging in some gentleman's  hall. No better or more effective way of doing this is to be found  than plunging them entirely in a bath composed of:    No. 17.--Carbolic Acid Wash, No. 3 (\"Poison\").    Carbolic acid,               1 lb.    Sal ammoniac,              0.5 oz.    Corrosive sublimate,         3 oz.    Pure tannin,                 4 oz.    Hot water,                   4 galls.    Mix this up in some out-house, or in the open air away from the house,  if a fine day; and when the mixture is cold plunge the heads or skins  in, holding the former by the horns, and stirring the latter about  with a stick; in fact, allowing the mixture to touch the hands as  little as possible.    It is, I believe, more efficacious if laid on hot than cold, but the  danger to health is greater. I venture to say that if there is  anything which will preserve objects for an indefinite period it is  corrosive sublimate. Deadly though it be, and dangerous to work with,  it has the advantage of being used as a finishing preparation, and  therefore need not, except in extreme cases, be handled.    Instead of rectified spirits of wine, I have used with much success as  an exterior wash for valuable bird skins, the following:    No. 18.--Preservative Wash.    Pure sulphuric ether,         1 pint.    Corrosive sublimate,          6 grs.    Keep in a stoppered bottle, labelled \"Poison,\" and when used apply  with a brush. This is more rapid in its evaporation than spirits of  wine, but is very expensive. Of course, the more rapidly any spirit  evaporates, and deposits poison previously held in solution, the  better chance you have of not spoiling your specimens.    PRESERVATIVE FLUIDS FOR FISHES AND REPTILES.    I have lately given a great deal of attention to the preservation of  fishes--and especially large ones--in some fluid which should have  four advantages:    1. Perfect preservation of the specimen--and which also, if a foreign  one, is consequently a long time in transit.    2. Its freedom from causing great shrinking or shrivelling of the  integument.    3. The points 1 and 2 being so well balanced that the specimen is in a  fit state--after many months--either to be treated as a specimen shown  in fluid, or to be mounted by the process of taxidermy.    4. The comparative cheapness and facility of carriage of the  preservative medium.    In trying to obtain all these advantages there seem almost insuperable  difficulties in the reconcilement of these diverse conditions.    Dr. A. Guenther, F.R.S, the eminent, ichthyologist and Chief of the  British Museum, recommends, in his new book, that pure or rectified  spirits of wine (56 per cent. over-proof) be the only thing used for  fishes, for permanent preservation in glass jars or tanks, and this  even for ordinary fishes 3 ft. to 4 ft. in length, or even up to 6 ft.  in length, if eel-like. \"Proof\" spirit (containing only 49 per cent.  by weight of pure alcohol as against 84 per cent. contained in  rectified spirit) is, says Dr. Guenther, the lowest strength which can  be used.    These will then stand as    No. 19.--Rectified Spirits of Wine (56 per cent. over-proof),    and    No. 20.--Proof Spirits of Wine.    If a spirituous solution is absolutely required, I would substitute  for pure spirits of wine methylated spirit (alcohol containing a  certain percentage of impure gum or undrinkable wood spirit) as being  cheap and sufficiently good for some purposes. It will not, however,  bear any diluting with water; it must stand, therefore, as    No. 21.--Methylated Spirit (undiluted),    or as    No. 22.--Alcoholic Solution, No. 1.    Methylated spirit,             1.5 pints.    Burnt alum (pounded),            2 oz.    Distilled water,               0.5 pint.    Saltpetre,                       4 oz.    This, which is to be well shaken together, becomes milky at first, but  will soon fine down, and may then be decanted.    No. 23.--Alcoholic Solution, No. 2.    Methylated spirit,              3 parts.    Glycerine,                      1 part.    Distilled water,                1 part.    Although turpentine will not preserve reptiles or fishes, yet, struck  with the perfect manner with which I was enabled to preserve  soft-bodied beetles for nearly a year in benzol or benzoline, I lately  tried if this cheap and colourless liquid would be of service for  other subjects, with the result that I have now some frogs (six or  seven) in a glass jar containing benzoline which have been immersed  for over three months, and have apparently undergone less change than  if in spirits for the same length of time. Whether they are likely to  be permanently preserved by this method I cannot, of course, yet  determine, but if so, it would be a great gain, owing to the  brilliancy of the liquid, its cheapness, and its advantages over all  alcoholic spirit in its less powerful action on the sealing wax or  coating used over the corks or stoppers of the glass preparation jars.    There is no doubt that pure spirits of wine will preserve objects for  a great length of time, but the cost is very serious to most persons,  or even to institutions of less importance than the British  Museum--added to which the strong spirit unquestionably shrivels and  distorts such objects as fishes and reptiles, whilst, diluted to any  appreciable extent, spirit will not preserve anything for any great  period.

Bourg-Madame is marked on most maps, but it is all but unknown of  itself; no one thinks of going there unless he be touring the  Pyrenees, or visiting Andorra, one of the unspoiled corners of  Europe, as quaint and unworldly to-day as it ever was; a tiny  republic of very, very few square kilometres, whose largest city or  town, or whatever you choose to call it, has but five hundred  inhabitants.    If one is swinging round the Pyrenean circle he goes on to Porte,  where, at the Auberge Michette, he will learn all that is needful for  penetrating into the unknown darkest spot in Europe. We thought to do  the journey \"_en auto,_\" but on arrival at Porte learned it was not  to be thought of. A sure-footed little Pyrenean donkey or mule was  the only pathfinder used to the twistings and turnings and blind  paths of this little mountain republic, where the people speak  Spanish, and religion and law are administrated by the French and  Spanish authorities in turn.    It's a week's travel properly to visit Andorra and view all its wild  unworldliness, so the trip is here only suggested.    [Illustration: Some Snap-shots in the Pyrenees]    We took up our route again, crossing the Col de Puymorans (1,781  metres), and dropped down on Hospitalet, which also is printed in  large black letters on the maps, but which contains only 148  inhabitants, unless there have been some births and no deaths since  this was written.    From Hospitalet we were going down, down, down all of the time, the  valley road of the Ariege, dropping with remarkable precipitation.    In eighteen kilometres we were at Aix-les-Thermes. The guide-books  call it \"_une jolie petite ville,_\" and no one will dispute it,  though it had no charms for us; we were more interested in routes and  roads than in mere watering-places, and so, beyond a stop for  gasoline for the motor, not having been able to get any for the last  fifty kilometres, still following the valley of the Ariege, we  arrived at Foix for lunch, at the most excellent Hotel Benoit, just  as the ice was being brought on the table and the _hors d'oeuvres_  were being portioned out.    Taken all in all, Foix was one of the most delightful towns we found  in all the Pyrenean itinerary. It is quite the most daintily and  picturesquely environed town imaginable, its triple-towered chateau  and its _rocher_ looming high above all, and sounding a dominant note  which carries one back to the days when Gaston Phoebus was the  seigneur of Foix.    We planned to spend the night at the Hotel de France at St. Girons,  for it was marked down in the Guide-Michelin as being fitted with  those modern refinements of travel which most of us appreciate, and  there was furthermore a garage and a _fosse_, or inspection pit. We  had need of the latter, for something was going wrong beneath the  body of our machine which manifestly require being attended to  without delay.    We took the long way around, twenty kilometres more out of our direct  road, for novelty of driving our automobile through the Grotto of Mas  D'Azil. We had been through grottoes before, the Grotte de Han in the  north of France, the caves where they ripen Rochefort cheeses, the  Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, and some others, but we had never expected  to drive an automobile through one. The Grotte de Mas-D'Azil is much  like other dark, damp holes elsewhere, and the only novelty is the  magnificent road which pierces it. The sensation of travelling over  this road is most weird, and it was well worth the trouble of making  the experiment.    From St. Girons to St. Gaudens and Montrejeau is sixty odd  kilometres. Nothing happened on the way except that the road was  literally thronged with great slow-moving ox-teams transporting great  logs down the mountainside to the sawmills in the lower valley.    Montrejeau was a surprise and a disappointment. It was a surprise  that we should find such a winsome little hill-town, and such a very  excellent hotel as was the Grand Hotel du Parc, which takes its name  from a tiny hanging garden at the rear; but we were disappointed in  that for a mortal half-hour we tried to make our usually willing  automobile climb up on to the plateau upon which the town sits. Three  separate roads we tried, each three separate times, but climb the  machine would not. No one knew why, the writer least of all, and he  had been _chauffeur_ and driver of that automobile for many long  months, and had never found a hill, great or small, that it would not  climb. Automobiles are capricious things, like women, and sometimes  they will and sometimes they will not. At last, after the natives had  had sufficient amusement, and had told us that they had seen many an  automobile party go without lunch because they could not get up that  steep little kilometre, we found a sort of back-door entrance which  looked easy, and we went up like the proverbial bird. It was not the  main road into town, and it took some finding. The writer hopes that  others who pass this way will be as successful. Montrejeau, with its  three steep streets, its excellent hotel (when you finally got in  touch with it), its old-world market-house, and its trim little  cafe-bordered square, will be long remembered.    We debated long as to whether we should drop down to Luchon, and come  around by Bagnerres-de-Bigorre or not, but since they were likely to  be full of \"five-o'-clockers\" at this season we thought the better of  it, and left them entirely out of our itinerary. When one wants it he  can get the same sort of conventionality at Ermenonville, and need  not go so far afield to find it.    We arrived at Tarbes, at the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, late on Sunday  afternoon. The name of the hotel augured well for good cheer, and on  the whole we found it satisfactory enough. One of its most appealing  features is the fact that the kitchens and the garage were once a  convent. It has undergone a considerable change since then, but it  lent a sort of glamour to things to know that you were stabling your  automobile in such a place.    Tarbes is a great busy, overgrown, unlovely big town, which flounders  under the questionable dignities of being a station of an army corps  and a prefecture: Bureaucracy and Officialdom are writ large all over  everything, and a poor mortal without a handle to his name, or a  ribbon in his buttonhole, is looked upon as a sort of outcast when he  enters a cafe, and accordingly he waits a long time to be served.    We got out of Tarbes at a _tres bonne heure_ the next morning without  a regret, headed for Pau. All of us had always had an affection for  Pau, because, in a way, we admired old Henri Quatre, even his  rascality.    We found Pau, too, a great, overgrown, fussy town, a bit more  delightfully environed than Tarbes, but still not at all what we had  pictured it. We knew it to be a tourist resort, but we were hardly  prepared for the tea-shops and the \"bars\" and the papers--in English  and \"American,\" as a local newsdealer told us when we went to him to  buy the inevitable picture postcards.    We found out, too, that Pau has long held a unique position as the  leading hunting centre on the Continent. It costs sixty francs a day  for the hire of a saddle-horse, and from 350 francs to four hundred  francs for the month--certainly rather dear. There are, as a rule,  from thirty to forty hunters available for hire each year, but many  of them are reserved by old stagers. Of privately owned horses  following the hunt, the number would usually somewhat exceed two  hundred. The hounds meet three times a week, and the municipality of  Pau shows its appreciation of the good that hunting does for the  Pyrenees resort by voting a subsidy of five thousand francs.    What history and romance there is about Pau is pretty well blotted  out by twentieth-century snobbism, it would seem.    One learns that Pau was the seat of a chateau of the princes of Bearn  as early as the tenth century. Its great splendour and importance  only came with the establishment here of the residence of Gaston IV.,  Comte de Foix, the usurper of the throne of Navarre in 1464. In his  train came a parliament, a university, an academy, and a mint.  Finally came the birth of Henri Quatre, and one may yet see the great  turtle-shell used by the afterwards gay monarch for a cradle. These  were gay times for Pau, and the same gaiety, though of a forced  nature, exists to-day with the throngs of English and Americans who  are trying hard to make of it a social resort. May they not succeed.  One thing they have done is to raise prices for everything to  everybody. This is bad enough to begin with, and so with this parting  observation Pau is crossed off the list.    There are eight highroads which cross the frontier passes from France  into Spain, and two lines of railway, one along the border of the  Atlantic and Hendaye, and the other following the Mediterranean coast  to Barcelona.    \"_Il n'y a plus de Pyrenees,_\" we were told as we were leaving Pau.  It seemed that news had just been received that in fourteen hours a  Spanish aeronaut had covered the 730 kilometres from Pau to Grenada  \"_comme les oiseaux._\" Truly, after this, there are no more  frontiers.    After Pau our route led to Mauleon (seventy-two kilometres) via  Oloron, straight across Bearn, where the peasants are still of that  picturesque mien which one so seldom sees out of the comic-opera  chorus. One reads that the Bearnais are \"irascible, jealous, and  spirituel.\"    This is some one's opinion of times long passed, but certainly we  found nothing of the kind; nothing indeed different from all the folk  of the South who dawdle at their work and spend most of their leisure  energetically dancing or eating.    Mauleon, known locally as Mauleon-Licharre to distinguish it from  Mauleon-Barousse, is the _douane_ station for entering France from  Spain (Pampelune) via St."]]]
