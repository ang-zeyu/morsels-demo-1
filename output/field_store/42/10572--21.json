So the vizier did as the king had commanded  him. And after that, the king went in to the damsel, and embraced her,  saying to her: \"O my mistress, wherefore hath been this silence, seeing  that thou hast been with me a whole year, awake and asleep, yet hast not  spoken to me, except on this day?\"    The damsel answered: \"Hear, O King of the age, and know that I am a poor  person, a stranger, broken-hearted: I have become separated from my  mother, and my family, and my brother.\" And when the king heard her  words, he knew her desire, and he replied: \"As to thy saying that thou  art poor, there is no occasion for such an assertion; for all my kingdom  and possessions are at thy service, and as to thy saying, 'I have become  separated from my mother and my family and my brother'--inform me in  what place they are, and I will send to them, and bring them to thee.\"  So she said to him: \"Know, O King, that my name is Gulnare (_Pomegranate  Flower_) of the Sea. My father was one of the Kings of the Sea, and he  died, and left to us the kingdom; but while we were enjoying it, another  of the kings came upon us, and took the kingdom from our hands. I have  also a brother named Saleh, and my mother is of the women of the sea;  and I quarrelled with my brother, and swore that I would throw myself  into the hands of a man of the inhabitants of the land. Accordingly I  came forth from the sea, and sat upon the shore of an island in the  moonlight, and there passed by a man who took me and sold me to this man  from whom thou tookest me, and he was an excellent, virtuous man, a  person of religion and fidelity and kindness. But had not thy heart  loved me, and hadst thou not preferred me above all thy wives, I had not  remained with thee one hour; for I should have cast myself into the sea  from this window, and gone to my mother and my people. I was ashamed,  however, to go to them; for they would imagine evil of me, and would not  believe me, even though I should swear to them, were I to tell them that  a king had purchased me with his money, and chosen me in preference to  his other wives and all that his right hand possessed. This is my story,  and peace be on thee!\" And when he heard her words, he thanked her, and  kissed her between the eyes, and said to her: \"By Allah, O my mistress,  and light of my eyes, I cannot endure separation from thee for one hour;  and if thou quit me, I shall die instantly. How then shall the affair  be?\" She answered: \"O my master, the time of the birth is near, and my  family must come.\" \"And how,\" said the king, \"do they walk in the sea  without being wetted?\" She answered: \"We walk in the sea as ye walk upon  the land, through the influence of the names engraved upon the seal of  Solomon, the son of David, upon both of whom be peace! But, O King,  when my family and my brethren come, I will inform them that thou  boughtest me with thy money, and hast treated me with beneficence, and  it will be meet that thou confirm my assertion to them. They will also  see thy state with their eyes, and will know that thou art a king, the  son of a king.\" And thereupon the king said: \"O my mistress, do what  seemeth fit to thee, and what thou wishest; for I will comply with thy  desire in all that thou wilt do.\" And the damsel said: \"Know, O King of  the age, that we walk in the sea with our eyes open, and see what is in  it, and we see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the sky as on  the face of the earth, and this hurteth us not. Know also, that in the  sea are many peoples and various forms of all the kinds that are on the  land; and know, moreover, that all that is on the land, in comparison  with what is in the sea, is a very small matter.\" And the king wondered  at her words.    Then the damsel took a bit of aloes-wood and, having lighted a fire in a  perfuming-vessel, threw into it that bit, and she proceeded to speak  words which no one understood; whereupon a great smoke arose, while the  king looked on. After this, she said to the king: \"O my lord, arise and  conceal thyself in a closet, that I may shew thee my brother and my  mother and my family without their seeing thee; for I desire to bring  them, and thou shalt see in this place, at this time, a wonder, and  shalt marvel at the various shapes and strange forms that God hath  created.\" So the king arose immediately, and entered a closet, and  looked to see what she would do. And she proceeded to burn perfume and  repeat spells until the sea foamed and was agitated, and there came  forth from it a young man of comely form, of beautiful countenance, like  the moon at the full, with shining forehead, and red cheeks, and hair  resembling pearls and jewels; he was, of all the creation, the most  like to his sister, and the tongue of the case itself seemed to recite  in his praise these verses:--       The moon becometh perfect once in each month; but the loveliness of thy       face is perfect every day.     Its abode is in the heart of one sign at a time; but thine abode is in       all hearts at once.    [Illustration]    _And she proceeded to burn perfume and repeat spells until the sea  foamed and was agitated._    Afterward, there came forth from the sea a grizzly-haired old woman, and  with her five damsels, resembling moons and bearing a likeness to the  damsel whose name was Gulnare. Then the king saw the young man and the  old woman and the damsels walk upon the surface of the water until they  came to Gulnare; and when they drew near to the window, and she beheld  them, she rose to them and met them with joy. On their seeing her, they  knew her, and they went in to her and embraced her, weeping violently;  and they said to her: \"O Gulnare, how is it that thou leavest us for  four years, and we know not the place in which thou art? By Allah, we  had no delight in food nor in drink a single day, weeping night and day  on account of the excess of our longing to see thee.\" Then the damsel  began to kiss the hand of her brother, and the hand of her mother, and  so also the hands of the daughters of her uncle, and they sat with her  awhile, asking her respecting her state, and the things that had  happened to her, and her present condition.    So she said to them: \"Know ye, that when I quitted you, and came forth  from the sea, I sat upon the shore of an island, and a man took me, and  sold me to a merchant, and the merchant brought me to this city, and  sold me to its king for ten thousand pieces of gold. Then he treated me  with attention, and forsook all his favourites for my sake, and was  diverted by his regard for me from everything that he possessed and what  was in his city.\" And when her brother heard her words, he said:  \"Praise be to God who hath reunited us! But it is my desire, O my  sister, that thou wouldst arise and go with us to our country and our  family.\" So when the king heard the words of her brother, his reason  fled in consequence of his fear lest the damsel should accept the  proposal of her kindred, and he could not prevent her, though he was  inflamed with love of her; wherefore he became perplexed in violent fear  of her separation. But as to the damsel Gulnare, on hearing the words of  her brother she said: \"By Allah, O my brother, the man who purchased me  is the king of this city, and he is a great king, and a man of wisdom,  generous, of the utmost liberality. He hath treated me with honour, and  he is a person of kindness, and of great wealth, but hath no male child  nor a female. He hath shewn me favour too, and acted well to me in every  respect; and from the day when I came to him to the present time, I have  not heard from him a word to grieve my heart; but he hath not ceased to  treat me with courtesy, and I am living with him in the most perfect of  enjoyments. Moreover, if I quitted him, he would perish: for he can  never endure my separation even for a single hour. I also, if I quitted  him, should die of my love for him in consequence of his kindness to me  during the period of my residence with him; for if my father were  living, my condition with him would not be like my condition with this  great, glorious king. God (whose name be exalted!) afflicted me not, but  compensated me well; and as the king hath not a male child nor a female,  I beg God to bless me with a son that may inherit of this great king  these palaces and possessions.\" And when her brother, and the daughters  of her uncle, heard her words, their eyes became cheerful thereat, and  they said to her: \"O Gulnare, thou art acquainted with our affection for  thee, and thou art assured that thou art the dearest of all persons to  us, and art certain that we desire for thee comfort, without trouble or  toil. Therefore if thou be not in a state of comfort, arise and  accompany us to our country and our family; but if thou be comfortable  here, in honour and happiness, this is our desire and wish.\" And Gulnare  replied: \"By Allah, I am in a state of the utmost enjoyment, in honour  and desirable happiness.\" So when the king heard these words from her,  he rejoiced, and he thanked her for them; his love for her penetrated to  his heart's core, and he knew that she loved him as he loved her, and  that she desired to remain with him to see his child which she was to  bring to him.    Then the damsel Gulnare of the Sea gave orders to the female slaves to  bring forward viands of all kinds; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#17)"],[1,"Mr. Field; and the gilding and painting by Mr. Hudson.    The Reredos was expressly designed with reference to a painted window  placed behind it: it is hardly necessary to say that it is greatly  benefitted by the general reduction of the glare of light, which  rendered the outlines of much of the statuary and more delicate  ornaments undistinguishable at a distance, but still more by the  transmission through it of glimpses of the most beautiful colours,  which change with every movement, however slight, in the position of  the eye, and whose very indistinctness and transitory character  contributes not a little to the effect which they tend to produce on  the mind.    The altar being raised above the level of the floor shews to advantage  the magnificent altar cloth, which is of rich crimson velvet,  embroidered with much taste and skill by Miss Agnes and Miss Ellen  Blencowe, and is thought to be worthy of the best ages of Mediaeval  embroidery. \"Its length is divided into three parts; the middle  containing a very beautiful figure of our Lord as risen, contained  within a pointed aureole of a deep blue colour, and bordered by  radiating beams. Broad orphreys embroidered in flowers divide the  middle compartment from the sides, which are of red velvet powdered  with conventional flowers;\"[45] the largest were copied from ancient  examples at East Langdon, Kent, and the others from Ottery,  Somersetshire.

Agnus Dei, miserere nobis.+\"[46] [Maltese       cross symbol]    [Footnote 45: Ecclesiologist.]    [Footnote 46: \"O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,  grant us Thy peace. Lamb of God, have mercy upon us.\"]    We now direct our attention to the monuments in the Choir, and  commence with the first arch on the south side of the Presbytery which  is occupied by the once gorgeous monument of Bishop de Luda, or Louth  (1290-1298), it consists of a lofty central arch with smaller openings  on the sides; above the arches are enriched gables with pinnacles and  finials; over the centre arch in a trefoil is a figure of the Saviour;  the restoration of the north side of this monument will afford some  idea of its original appearance; the effect has been somewhat subdued  by the softened light from the east window. The indent in the  gravestone under the arch leaves no doubt of its having been once  finished with a brass effigy.    The next arch contains the tomb of Bishop Barnet (1366-1373); it is of  Purbeck marble, with quatrefoils on the sides, and had originally the  effigy of the bishop engraved in brass on the table of the tomb.    Under the third arch is the high monument of John Tiptoft, earl of  Worcester, one of the patrons of Caxton, the first English printer;  this is in the Perpendicular style, but less beautiful than that of  Bishop Redman, on the opposite side: on the table of the tomb are the  effigies of the earl and his two wives; the two latter only were  buried here, the earl having been beheaded and buried in London in  1470.    The tomb of Bishop Hotham (1316-1337) has been partially restored and  placed in the next arch, on the south side of the altar; it formerly  stood under a high canopy on the north side, but originally in the  first arch of his own work. There was probably a recumbent figure on  the top, but it has long since disappeared.    Opposite to this, on the north side of the altar, on a base of Purbeck  marble, are placed the interesting remains of the tomb of Bishop  Northwold (1229-1254), the munificent founder of the Presbytery, which  were originally placed over his grave in the centre of his own work.  It is a large slab of Purbeck marble, highly adorned with carving;  perhaps one of the finest specimens of its period: the effigy of the  prelate is represented as resting beneath a cinquefoil canopy in his  robes, bearing his crosier, with a lion and dragon under his feet;  beneath this is a representation of the martyrdom of St. Edmund, a  prince of East Anglia, by the Danes, commemorative of his having been  lord abbot of Bury before he was preferred to the see of Ely; the  niches in the sides of the prelate's stall have statuettes--on the  left, St. Etheldreda, an abbess crowned, and a nun; on the right, a  king, an abbot, and a monk: at the top on each side of the head are  angels with censers, and other symbolical figures.    The monument or shrine which was formerly placed over the tomb of  Bishop Hotham, has been in part restored, and now occupies the third  arch on the north side. This, with the tomb now on the south side of  the altar under it, originally stood in the first arch of his own  work, near his place of sepultre; it is in the Decorated style, and  was richly coloured and gilded. Part of it was cut away in order to  make room for the stalls when the choir occupied the six eastern  arches, but this has been rebuilt. This is now thought to have been  part of the sub-structure of the shrine of St. Etheldreda, as adapted  by Alan de Walsingham.    The second arch from the west, is occupied by the tomb of Bishop  Kilkenny (1254-1256,) who died at Sugho, in Spain, while on an embassy  to the Spanish Court; his body was buried there, his heart being only  interred here. The tomb is of Purbeck marble, and is a fine example of  the Early English style. The bishop is represented as in the act of  benediction, with a pastoral staff, and in full pontificals; his head  is shown as resting on a cushion, and is surmounted by a trefoil arch  with a crocketed gable, and a censer-bearing angel on each side.    In the next, or more western arch, is the beautiful monument of Bishop  Redman (1501-1505). It is a fine specimen of the Perpendicular Style,  and is richly ornamented with niches and canopies, and a variety of  shields with arms, and emblems of the passion; the effigy of the  bishop is recumbent on a high tomb under a rich canopy, with a space  left at the foot for a chantry priest. Passing through this space we  enter the    +North Aisle of the Choir,+    and first proceeding towards the western end of it, we notice the new  back screens which have been erected to mask the stall work in two of  the bays, and against which have been placed the monuments of Bishop  Fleetwood (1714-1723), and of his son Dr. Charles Fleetwood (1737);  the third bay is occupied by the new and elegant staircase to the  organ; it is of open work, richly carved, with foliated mouldings and  ornaments.    Opposite to this, in the north wall, is a beautiful door-arch,  formerly the means of communication with the Lady Chapel; it has  statues in large niches on each side, many smaller niches, crockets,  and finials, and over the keystone a sitting figure; the mouldings and  ornaments were originally beautified by colours and gilding, but all  are injured and defaced, and the figures have disappeared.    A little further eastward is the memorial brass laid over the grave of  Mr. Bassevi, the eminent architect of the Fitzwilliam Museum at  Cambridge, who was accidentally killed by a fall in the western Tower  in 1845.    The monuments of Bishop Redman and Kilkenny, which we noticed in our  survey of the Choir, are in their original places; and we now pass in  succession those of Bishops Patrick (1691-1707), Mawson (1754-1770),  and Laney (1667-1675). In 1770 many monuments were removed from the  Presbytery to make room for the Choir, and a few were again removed  for the purpose of carrying out the recent arrangements. In the last  bay but one (now opening to the Retro-Choir) stood the monument of  Bishop Gray (1454-1478), but the gravestone only remains, from which  the brass has been removed. The arms of this prelate may be observed  in the sides of three of the windows of this aisle, no doubt altered  by him to their present form.         The first or western window of the Presbytery has been       filled with stained glass executed by M. Lusson, of Paris,       illustrative of the history of St. John the Baptist; the       gift of the Rev. Chancellor Sparke.         The second window, executed by Messrs. Clayton and Bell,       contains subjects illustrative of the miracles; designed as       a memorial of the Rev. J.H. Sparke, many years Canon of the       Cathedral, and Chancellor of the Diocese.         The third window, by the same artist, also contains subjects       illustrative of the miracles; designed as a memorial of       Agneta, widow of Chancellor Sparke.         The fourth window, executed by Mr. Hughes, contains subjects       from the parables--the wheat and tares, the vineyard, and       the lost sheep; and the miraculous draught of fishes,       designed as a memorial of Eliza, widow of Canon Fardell.         The fifth window, executed by Mr. Ward, contains in the two       western lights subjects from the parable of the ten virgins;       and in the others illustrations of the passage in Matt. XXV.       35, 36. \"I was an hungered and ye gave me meat,\" &c.;       designed as a memorial of Rev. H. Fardell, Canon of Ely.    At the end of this aisle, occupying the space of one bay, is the  +Chapel of Bishop Alcock+, (1486-1500), who was comptroller of works  under Henry VII., and founder of Jesus College, Cambridge. The chapel  is in the Perpendicular style, and was built A.D. 1488, as appears  from a stone found underground some years ago, and inserted in the  wall under the east window, bearing the following inscription,  scarcely legible:         \"+Johanes Alkoc epus Eliesis hanc fabrica fieri fecit.       M.cccclxxxviii.+\"    The ornamental portion is curiously executed, but the pinnacles are  disproportioned and crowded, presenting a confused and heavy  appearance; the vaulted ceiling is rich and elaborate, with a large  pendent of curious workmanship in the centre.
