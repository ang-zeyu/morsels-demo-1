At  Cirta the church and the library were evidently in the same building,  from the way in which they are spoken of in the account of the persecution  of A.D. 303-304. \"The officers,\" we are told, \"went into the building  (_domus_) where the Christians were in the habit of meeting.\" There they  took an inventory of the plate and vestments. \"But,\" proceeds the  narrative, \"when they came to the library, the presses there were found  empty[121].\" Augustine, on his deathbed, A.D. 430, gave directions that  \"the library of the church [at Hippo], and all the manuscripts, should be  carefully preserved by those who came after him[122].\"    Further, there appears to be good reason for believing that when a church  had a triple apse, the lateral apses were separated off by a curtain or a  door, the one to contain the sacred vessels, the other the books. This  view, which has been elaborated by De Rossi in explanation of three  recesses in the thickness of the wall of the apse of a small private  oratory discovered in Rome in 1876[123], is chiefly supported by the  language of Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, who lived from about A.D. 353 to  A.D. 431. He describes a basilica erected by himself at Nola in honour of  S. Felix, martyr, as having \"an apse divided into three (_apsidem  trichoram_)[124]\"; and in a subsequent passage, after stating that there  are to be two recesses, one to the right, the other to the left of the  apse, he adds, \"these verses indicate the use of each[125],\" and gives the  following couplets, with their headings:    _On the right of the Apse._      Hic locus est veneranda penus qua conditur, et qua    Ponitur alma sacri pompa ministerii.      Here are the sacred vessels stored, and here    The peaceful trappings of our holy rites.    _On the left of the same._      Si quem sancta tenet meditandi in lege voluntas    Hic poterit residens sacris intendere libris.      Here he whose thoughts are on the laws of God    May sit and ponder over holy books.    As De Rossi explains, the first of the two niches was intended to contain  the vessels and furniture of the altar; the second was reserved for the  safe-keeping of the sacred books. The word _trichora_, in Greek [Greek:  tricho], is used by later writers to designate a three-fold division of  any object--as for instance, by Dioscorides, of the seed-pod of the  acacia[126].    Whether this theory of the use of the apse be accurate or fanciful, the  purely Christian libraries to which I have alluded were undoubtedly  connected, more or less closely, with churches; and I submit that the  libraries which in the Middle Ages were connected with cathedrals and  collegiate churches are their lineal descendants.    I have next to consider the libraries formed by monastic communities, the  origin of which may be traced to very early times. Among the Christians of  the first three centuries there were enthusiasts who, discontented with  the luxurious life they led in the populous cities along the coasts of  Africa and Syria, fled into the Egyptian deserts, there to lead a life of  rigorous self-denial and religious contemplation. These hermits were  presently joined by other hermits, and small communities were gradually  formed, with a regular organization that foreshadowed the Rules and  Customs of the later monastic life. Those who governed these primitive  monasteries soon realised the fact that without books their inmates would  relapse into barbarism, and libraries were got together. The Rule of S.  Pachomius (A.D. 292-345), whose monastery was at Tabennisi near Denderah  in Upper Egypt, provides that the books of the House are to be kept in a  cupboard (_fenestra_) in the thickness of the wall. Any brother who wanted  a book might have one for a week, at the end of which he was bound to  return it. No brother might leave a book open when he went to church or  to meals. In the evening the officer called \"the Second,\" that is, the  second in command, was to take charge of the books, count them, and lock  them up.[127]    These provisions, insisted upon at a very early date, form a suitable  introduction to the most important section of my subject--the care of  books by the Monastic Orders. With them book-preserving and book-producing  were reduced to a system, and in their libraries--the public libraries of  the Middle Ages--literature found a home, until the invention of printing  handed over to the world at large the duties which had been so well  discharged by special communities. This investigation is full of  difficulty; and, though I hope to arrive at some definite conclusions  respecting the position, size, dimensions, and fittings of monastic  libraries, I must admit that my results depend to a certain extent on  analogy and inference. It should be remembered that in England the  monasteries were swept away more than three centuries ago by a sudden  catastrophe, and that those who destroyed them were far too busy with  their own affairs to place on record the aspect or the plan of what they  were wrecking. In France again, though little more than a century has  elapsed since her monasteries were overwhelmed by the Revolution, and  though descriptions and views of many of her great religious houses have  been preserved, and much has been done in the way of editing catalogues of  their manuscripts, there is still a lamentable dearth of information on my  particular subject.    I shall begin by quoting some passages from the Rules and Customs of the  different Orders, which shew (1) that reading was encouraged and enforced  by S. Benedict himself, with whom the monastic life, as we conceive it,  may be said to have originated; (2) that subsequently, as Order after  Order was founded, a steady development of feeling with regard to books,  and an ever-increasing care for their safe-keeping, can be traced.    The Rule of S. Benedict was made public early in the sixth century; and  the later Orders were but offshoots of the Benedictine tree, either using  his Rule or basing their own statutes upon it. It will therefore be  desirable to begin this research by examining what S. Benedict said on the  subject of study, and I will translate a few lines from the 48th chapter  of his Rule, _Of daily manual labour_.        Idleness is the enemy of the soul; hence brethren ought,      at certain seasons, to occupy themselves with manual      labour, and again, at certain hours, with holy      reading....        Between Easter and the calends of October let them apply      themselves to reading from the fourth hour till near the      sixth hour.        From the calends of October to the beginning of Lent let      them apply themselves to reading until the second      hour.... During Lent, let them apply themselves to      reading from morning until the end of the third hour ...      and, in these days of Lent, let them receive a book      apiece from the library, and read it straight through.      These books are to be given out at the beginning of      Lent[128].    In this passage the _library_--by which a book-press is probably to be  understood--is specially mentioned. In other words, at that early date the  formation of a collection of books was contemplated, large enough to  supply the community with a volume apiece, without counting the  service-books required for use in the church.    The Benedictine Order flourished and increased abundantly for more than  four centuries, until, about A.D. 912, the order of Cluni was established.  It was so called from the celebrated abbey near Macon in Burgundy, which,  though not the first house of the Order in point of date, became  subsequently the first in extent, wealth, and reputation. As a stricter  observance of the Rule of S. Benedict was the main object which the  founder of this Order had in view, the Benedictine directions respecting  study are maintained and developed. The Customs prescribe the following  regulations for books:        On the second day of Lent the only passage of the Rule      to be read in Chapter is that concerning the observance      of Lent.        Then shall be read aloud a note (_brevis_) of the books      which a year before had been given out to brethren for      their reading. When a brother's name is called, he      rises, and returns the book that had been given to him;      and if it should happen that he has not read it through,      he is to ask forgiveness for his want of diligence.        A carpet on which those books are to be laid out is to      be put down in the Chapter-House; and the titles of      those which are distributed to brethren afresh are to be      noted, for which purpose a tablet is to be made of      somewhat larger size than usual[129].    In a subsequent chapter it is directed that the books are to be entrusted  to the official \"who is called Precentor and _Armarius_, because he  usually has charge of the library, which is also called the _armarium_  (press)[130]. This arrangement shews that up to this date all the books,  whether service-books or not, were regarded as belonging to the church.    I come next to the decrees given to the English Benedictines by Archbishop  Lanfranc in or about 1070. \"We send you\" he says \"the Customs of our Order  in writing, selected from the Customs of those houses (_coenobia_) which  are in our day of the highest authority in the monastic order[131].\" The  section relating to books is so interesting that I will translate it.        On the Monday after the first Sunday in Lent ... before      the brethren go in to Chapter, the librarian (_custos      librorum_) ought to have all the books brought together      into the Chapter-House and laid out on a carpet, except      those which had been given out for reading during the      past year: these the brethren ought to bring with them      as they come into Chapter, each carrying his book in his      hand. Of this they ought to have had notice given to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#17)"],[1," mixture of the powdered roasted seeds, 8 grams, with  double the quantity of acid tartrate of potassium. Its action is  gentle, but sure. The alcoholic extract of the root, a soft, brown,  resinous substance with an odor recalling that of jalap, is a very  active cathartic, producing sharp effects in doses of 30-60 centigrams;  in fact it produces such severe tenesmus that its use in such doses  should not be recommended.    The root bark is used internally in an infusion (4-8 grams to 1 liter  of water) as an emollient in irritability of the bladder and urethra  and has been recommended for such a purpose by Mooden Sheriff. It  is a diuretic which frequently acts as a purgative, a fact that  is not surprising in view of the above-mentioned properties of the  alcoholic extract.    The roasted seeds used as a purgative are so trustworthy that they  deserve the further attention of physicians.    Botanical Description.--A vine very well known by its blue  flowers. Leaves alternate with 3 pairs of oval leaflets. Stipules  persistent. Flowers axillary, solitary, 1-1 1/2' in long  diameter. Calyx in 5 acute divisions, the two upper ones  smaller. Corolla papilionaceous. Standard open, notched at the  end. Keel shorter than the wings and covered by them. Stamens 10,  9 united and 1 free. Stigma downy, thick. Pod full of short hairs,  with more than 6 surrounded with a tow-like substance, reniform,  with black spots.    Habitat.--Common along the roads and in gardens. Flowers in July  and November.        _1. Pterocarpus santalinus_, L. [5]    Nom. Vulg.--_Narra_, _Naga_, Tag.; _Apalit_, _Daytanag_, Pam.; _Red  Saunders_ or _Red Sandalwood Tree_, Eng.    _2. P. Indicus,_ Willd. (_P. pallidus_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Asana_, Tag.; _Naga_, Vis.    _3. P. erinaceus_, Poir. (_P. echinatus_, Pers. & DC.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Asana_, _Narra_, Tag.    Uses.--The wood of the first is the so-called \"red sandalwood.\" It  is used for building purposes and, in medicine, as an astringent. In  decoction it is used as a gargle for sore throat. The second is  also an excellent building material and is used medicinally for its  astringent properties. A decoction of sufficient strength to color  the water a light blue is used as a mouth wash in toothache and has  some reputation as a solvent of vesical calculi. All three species  yield a resin known in pharmacy under the name of \"kino.\" The true  gum kino is really produced by the _P. marsupium_, Roxb., but the  Philippine product, especially that of the second and third species,  has for a long time been exported to Europe under the name of \"red  astringent gum\" or \"kino.\" This name is given to the sap of these  trees dried without the aid of artificial heat. The bark is the part  which produces it and the following extractive process is employed in  Madras: a vertical incision is made in the trunk and lateral incisions  perpendicular to it and a receptacle is placed at the foot of the  tree. This soon fills and when the gum is sufficiently dried by air  and sun it is packed in boxes and exported.    In respect to appearance, solubility and chemical composition,  Flückiger and Hanbury were unable to discover any difference between  the kino of _P. marsupium_, Roxb., and that of _P. erinaceus_, Poir. It  is therefore interesting to consider a product that is identical with  that described in the pharmacopoeias as produced by the _P. marsupium_,  Roxb., though the latter does not grow in the Philippines.    Kino is at present used but little in therapeutics and its action is  analogous to that of tannin and catechu. It is given internally for  its astringent effect in chronic diarrhoea, leucorrhoea, blenorrhoea  and hemorrhages. The dose of the powder is 1-4 grams, and of the  alcoholic tincture, containing 20 parts kino to 100 of alcohol,  5-10 grams. In prolapse of the rectum and anal fissure the following  solution is used by enema:                      Kino            3 grams.                  Water         500 grams.      For vaginal injections a solution of 20 to 250 water.    Botanical Description.--The \"pterocarpus,\" L., is a tree of  the first order with odd-pinnate leaves. Leaflets alternate and  coriaceous. Flowers yellow, in racemes, with caducous bracts and  bractlets. Calyx turbinate, with short teeth. Petals exserted,  markedly unguiculate. Standard and wings curled. Keel obtuse with  its petals slightly or not at all coherent. The staminal tube,  cleft above and below or above only. Stamens superior, often almost,  and at times entirely, free. Anthers versatile. Ovary pedunculate,  with 2 ovules. Style curved. Stigma terminal. Pod orbicular, smooth or  spiny, usually containing one seed, encircled by a broad, rigid wing,  the point curved downward.    Habitat.--In the mountains of Luzon, Panay and Mindoro. Blooms  in March.        _Pongamia glabra_, Vent. (_Robinia mitis_, L.; _Gadelupa maculata_,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Balikbalik_, Tag.; _Butong_, Vis.    Uses.--The oil expressed from the seeds is used in India for lighting  purposes, and in addition is of notable therapeutic value. It is an  excellent local remedy for the itch, for herpes and especially for  pityriasis versicolor, used alone or emulsified with lemon juice. In  stubborn cases Dymock recommends the addition of oil of _hydrocarpus_,  camphor and powdered sulphur. Dr. Gibson states that he knows of  no plant in the vegetable kingdom possessing more notable curative  properties in itch, herpes and other cutaneous diseases than the  plant under consideration. It is also used as an embrocation in  articular rheumatism.    The powdered leaves mixed with common salt and pepper are given  internally with a little milk, as a remedy for leprosy.    The juice of the root makes a useful wash for gangrenous ulcers and  a good injection for fistula.    Botanical Description.--A tree, 18° high, with leaves opposite,  odd-pinnate. Leaflets in 3 pairs, ovate, lanceolate, entire,  glabrous and membranaceous. Flowers slightly spotted, racemose. Calyx  bell-shaped, with 5 scarcely visible toothlets. Corolla papilionaceous,  petals equal, clawed. Standard with 2 callosities athwart the  base. Stamens 10, diadelphous. Pod with one seed, which is flat,  smooth, veined, bright red.    Habitat.--Luzon and Panay. Blooms in October.          LEGUMINOSÆ.    Brasiletto Family.        _Cæsalpinia Bonducella_, Flem. (_Guilandina Bonducella_, L.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Bayag-Kambing_, _Kalambibit_, Tag.; _Dalugdug_, Vis.;  _Fever Nut_, _Physic Nut_, _Bonduc Seeds_, Indo-Eng.    Uses.--The seed is the part of the plant employed and is official in  the Pharmacopoeia of India. It is used as a tonic and antiperiodic  in intermittent fevers and in general where tonic treatment is  indicated. It has given good results in the malarial fevers of India,  according to English physicians. The Pharmacopoeia of India contains  the following preparation under the name of \"Compound Powder of Bonduc\"  (Pulvis bonducellæ compositus).              Seeds of Bonduc, powdered     30 grams.          Pepper                        30 grams.      Mix and keep in a well-corked flask.    Dose.--1-2 grams 3 times a day.    In the Philippines the powdered seed is given in affections of the  digestive tract, especially in diarrhoea and feeble digestion. The same  name of Bonduc is given to the seeds of another species that grows in  the Philippines, _C. Bonduc_, Roxb.; _Kamot-Kabag_, _Bayan-Kambing_,  Tag. The seeds are identical in chemical composition and therapeutic  indication.    The two principal substances contained in the seeds are an oil, 24%  and a resin, 1.88%. The former is straw-colored and slightly bitter  by virtue of the presence of a resin that may be precipitated by  alcohol. The resin or bitter principle exists as an amorphous powder,  white, bitter, not acrid, soluble in chloroform, alcohol, acetone,  crystallizable acetic acid, fixed and essential oils; slightly soluble  in ether and bisulphide of carbon, insoluble in water and petroleum  ether. The alkalies do not affect it. It melts at 140°, decomposing and  leaving only a carbon. Its discoverers, Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen,  have given it the name _bonducin_ (C_14_H_15_O_5_). Hydrochloric acid  colors it red; sulphuric acid, a maranthin red in half an hour.    Bonducin seems to be the active principle of the seeds and is given  internally in doses of 10-20 centigrams; according to Dr. Isnard,  of Marseilles, this dose has given as good results in fevers as the  same quantity of quinine.    Botanical Description.--A shrub with prostrate stem bristling with  thorns. Leaves twice abruptly pinnate, a thorn taking the place  of the terminal leaflet. Leaflets in 10-14 pairs, ovate, expanded,  with a spine at the apex. Common petioles thorny, with 4 leaf-like  stipules at the base. Flowers yellow, in racemes. Calyx 5-parted,  curved downward. Corolla inserted on the calyx, 5 petals, 4 nearly  equal, the uppermost broader and shorter. Stamens 10. Filaments  very unequal in height, inserted on the calyx, united and woolly  at the base. Pistil very short. Stigma thick. Pod rhomboidal before  maturity, prickly, containing 2 semi-globose seeds with testa hard,  mottled and tough.    The other species, _C. Bonduc_, Roxb., is distinguished by leaflets  unequal at the base, by the absence of stipules, and by the bright  orange yellow seeds.    Habitat.--Common in Luzon, Panay and Joló. Blooms in December.        _Cæsalpinia Sappan_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Sibukao_, _Sapag_, Tag.; _Palo del Brasil_, Sp.; _Sappan  Wood_, Eng.    Uses.--The decoction of Sibukao is given in hemorrhages, especially  of the lungs. It is probably the red color of this decoction which  originated the idea of giving it to check bleeding, and this is the  practice of the native Filipino doctors, as well as of the Arabs  and Hindoos. The natives of Cochin China, reasoning in an opposite  manner, prescribe it as emmenagogue. Some authors"]]]
