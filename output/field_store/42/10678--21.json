He thought he saw the Prince wounded at the same time that  Trooper Abel threw up his arms. He thought the Prince might have  been dragged to the place where he was found after death, and that a  rally might have been made twenty yards beyond the donga.    Colonel Harrison being called, stated that Carey was senior  combatant officer, and must therefore have been in command of the  party. Carey volunteered to go on the reconnaissance to verify  certain points of his sketch. The Prince was ordered to go to  report more fully on the ground. He had given the Prince into  Carey's charge.    Examined by the Court, Colonel Harrison stated that when the Prince  was attached to his department he was not told to treat him as a  royal personage in the matter of escort, but as any other officer,  taking due precaution against any possible danger.    Dr. Scott (the Prince's medical attendant) was then called, and  stated that the Prince was killed by eighteen assegai wounds, any  five of which would have been fatal. There were no bullet wounds.  The Prince died where the body was found.    This closed the case for the prosecution.    The defence called again Colonel Harrison, who testified to Carey's  abilities as a staff officer, and said he had every confidence in  him.    Colonel Bellairs was also called, and stated that it was in  consequence of the occurrence of the 1st June that Carey had been  deposed from his staff appointment the day previous to his trial.    Lieutenant Carey here submitted that his case had been pre-judged,  and that he had been punished before his trial.    The following is Lieutenant Carey's statement:--    \"On the 31st May I was informed by Colonel Harrison, A.Q.M.G., that  the Prince Imperial was to start on the 1st June to ride over the  road selected by me for the advance of the column, for the purpose  of selecting a camping-ground for the 2nd June. I suggested at once  that I should be allowed to go with him, as I knew the road and  wanted to go over it again for the purpose of verifying certain  points. To this Colonel Harrison consented, reminding me that the  Prince was going at his own request to do this work, and that I was  not to interfere with him in any way. For our escort, six Europeans  of Bettington's Horse and six Basutos were ordered. Bettington's men  were paraded at 9 A.M., but owing to some misunderstanding the  Basutos did not turn up, and, the Prince being desirous of  proceeding at once, we went without them. On arriving at the ridge  between Itelezi and Incenci, I suggested waiting for them, but the  Prince replied, 'Oh no; we are quite strong enough,' or words to  that effect. We proceeded on our reconnaissance from there, halting  about half-an-hour on a high hill overlooking the Ityotyozi for the  Prince to sketch. From here the country was visible for miles, and  no sign of the enemy could be discovered. We then descended into the  valley, and, entering a kraal, off saddled, knee-haltering our  horses. We had seen the deserted appearance of the country, and,  though the kraal was to the right, surrounded by mealies, we thought  there was no danger in encamping. If any blame is attributable to  any one for this, it is to me, as I agreed with the Prince that we  were perfectly safe. I had been over this ground twice before and  seen no one, and the brigade-major of the cavalry brigade had ridden  over it with only two or three men, and laughed at me for taking so  large an escort. We had with us a friendly Zulu, who, in answer to  my inquiries, said no Zulus were about. I trusted him, but still  kept a sharp look-out, telescope in hand. In about an hour--that is,  3.40 P.M.--the Prince ordered us to saddle up. We went into the  mealies to catch our horses, but took at least ten minutes saddling.  While doing so, the Zulu guide informed us he had seen a Zulu in the  distance, but as he did not appear concerned, I saw no danger. The  Prince was saddled up first, and, seeing him ready, I mounted, the  men not being quite ready. The Prince then asked if they were all  ready; they answered in the affirmative, and he gave the word,  'Prepare to mount.' At this moment I turned round, and saw the  Prince with his foot in the stirrup, looking at the men. Presently I  heard him say, 'Mount,' and turning to the men saw them vault into  their saddles. At this moment my eyes fell on about twenty black  faces in the mealies, twenty to thirty yards off, and I saw puffs of  smoke and heard a rattling volley, followed by a rush, with shouts  of 'Usutu!' There was at once a stampede. Two men rushed past me,  and as every one appeared to be mounted, I dug the spurs into my  horse, which had already started of his own accord. I felt sure no  one was wounded by the volley, as I heard no cry, and I shouted out,  'Keep to the left, and cross the donga, and rally behind it!' At the  same time I saw more Zulus in the mealies on our left flank, cutting  off our retreat. I crossed the donga behind two or three men, but  could only get beyond one man, the others having ridden off. Riding  a few hundred yards on to the rise, I stopped and looked round. I  could see the Zulus after us, and saw that the men were escaping to  the right, and that no one appeared on the other side of the donga.  The man beside me then drew my attention to the Prince's horse,  which was galloping away on the other side of the donga, saying, 'I  fear the Prince is killed, sir!' I immediately said, 'Do you think  it is any use going back?' The trooper pointed to the mealies on our  left, which appeared full of Kaffirs, and said, 'He is dead long  ago, sir; they assegai wounded men at once.' I considered he had  fallen near the kraal, as his horse was going from that direction,  and it was useless to sacrifice more lives. I had but one man near  me, the others being some 200 yards down the valley. I accordingly  shouted to them to close to the left, and rode on to gain a drift  over the Tombokala River, saying to the man at my side, 'We will  keep back towards General Wood's camp, not returning the same way  we came, and then come back with some dragoons to get the bodies.'  We reached camp about 6.30 P.M. When we were attacked our carbines  were unloaded, and, to the best of my belief, no shots were fired. I  did not see the Prince after I saw him mounting, but he was mounted  on a swift horse, and I thought he was close to me. Besides the  Prince, we lost two troopers, as well as the friendly Zulu. Two  troopers have been found between the donga and the kraal, covered  with assegai wounds. They must have fallen in the retreat and been  assegaied at once, as I saw no fighting when I looked round.\"    The court-martial condemned Lieutenant Carey, and he was sent home  under arrest. But eventually, owing to the intervention of the  bereaved Empress, and many sympathetic friends, the unfortunate  officer was released. The news of the calamity was received with  profound grief throughout the country. Some mourned the death of a  Prince, some sighed over the extinction of Napoleonic hopes,  officers regretted the loss of a promising comrade, and mothers  spent tears of sympathy for the great lady, Empress and mother, who  had thus been bereft of her only child.      THE VICTORY    To return to the progress of the war. On the 26th of June the  long-expected junction of the columns was on the eve of being  effected. Cetchwayo was pretending to make overtures for peace,  though at the same time his people were endeavouring to enter into  alliance with rebellious Boers. He even sent the sword of the Prince  Imperial as a peace-offering. On the envelope, however, his  amanuensis, one Cornelius Vjin (a Dutchman), pencilled the fact that  the king had 20,000 men with him. The reply of Lord Chelmsford was  as follows:----    \"If the Induna, Mundula, brings with him the 1000 rifles taken at  Isandlwana, I will not insist on 1000 men coming in to lay down  their arms, if the Zulus are afraid to come. He must bring the two  guns and the remainder of the cattle. I will then be willing to  negotiate. As he has caused me to advance by the great delay he has  made, I must now go to the Umvolosi to enable my men to drink. I  will consent, pending negotiations, to halt on the further bank of  the river, and will not burn any kraals until the 3rd of July,  provided no opposition is made to my advance to the position on the  Umvolosi, by which day, the 3rd of July, at noon, the conditions  must be complied with. If my force is fired on, I shall consider  negotiations are at an end, and to avoid any chance of this, it is  best that Mundula come to my camp at daybreak or to-night, and that  the Zulus should withdraw from the neighbourhood of the river to  Ulundi. I cannot stop the general in command of the coast army until  these conditions are complied with.\"    Of course nothing was seen of Mundula, and preparations were made  for the reception of the enemy. Newdigate and Wood laagered their  waggons and prepared for the arrival of an impi of some 20,000 Zulus  advancing from Ulundi. On the following day a large force under  Colonel Buller advanced to Nodwengu kraal, and some stragglers were  killed. One of these was struck by Lord William Beresford, who, in  the sporting manner characteristic of him, cried, \"First spear, by  Jove!\"    On the morning of the memorable 4th of July the army, crossing  Umvolosi River, marched to a higher plateau--where once the Zulus  had vanquished the Boers--there to prepare for battle. The Zulus,  some 20,000 strong, after many war dances and cries, were marshalled  forth by their king to an open plain between the Nodwengu and Ulundi  kraals. Our troops were formed up in a hollow parallelogram, in the  centre being the native contingent with ammunition waggons. The four  sides of this parallelogram were formed of eight companies"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23748"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 3 (#17)"],[1,"after the  New England town. Over those who rushed to the vicinity of Sutter's mill  that gentleman became virtual Alcalde, though he was not recognized by  all. The men first opening a placer would seek to pre-empt all the  adjoining land, giving up only when others came in numbers too strong  for them. Officers were elected and new customs sanctioned as they were  needed. Partnerships were sacredly maintained, yet by no other law than  that of the camp. Crimes against property and life seem to have been  infrequent at first, but the unparalleled wealth toled in and developed  a criminal class, which the rudimentary government could not control.  San Francisco formed in 1851 a vigilance committee of citizens, by which  crimes could be more summarily and surely punished. The pioneer banking  house in California began business at San Francisco in January, 1849.  The same month saw the first frame house on the Sacramento, near  Sutter's Fort.    The vast acquisition of territory by the Mexican War seemed destined to  be a great victory for slavery, because nearly all of it lay south of 36  degrees 30 minutes and hence by the Missouri Compromise could become  slave soil. But there was the complication that under Mexico all this  wide realm had been free. To exist there legally slavery must therefore  be established by Congress, making the case very different from the  cases of Louisiana, Florida, and Texas, which came under United States  authority already burdened. This predisposed many who were not in  general opposed to slavery, against extending the institution hither.  Early in the war a bill had passed the House, failing almost by accident  in the Senate, which contained the famous Wilmot Proviso, so named from  its mover in the House, that, except for crime, neither slavery nor  involuntary servitude should ever exist in any of the territories to be  annexed. Wilmot was a Democrat, and at this time a decided majority of  his party favored the proviso. But the pro-slavery wing rallied, while  the Whigs, disbelieving in the war and in annexation both, offered the  proviso Democrats no hearty aid. In consequence it was defeated both  then and after the annexation.    The election of 1848 went for the Whigs, and the next March 4th, General  Taylor became President. Though a southerner and a slave-holder, he was  moderate and a true patriot. So rapid had been the influx into  California that the Territory needed a stable government. Accordingly,  one of Taylor's first acts as President was to urge California to apply  for admission to statehood. General Riley, military governor, at once  called a convention, which, sitting from September 1st to October 13th,  framed a constitution and made request that California be taken into the  Union. This constitution prohibited slavery, and thus a new firebrand  was tossed into the combustible material with which the political  situation abounded. By this time nearly all the friends of freedom were  for the proviso, but its enemies as well had greatly increased. The  immense growth, actual and prospective, of northern population, greatly  inspired one side and angered the other.    [1850]    Resort was now had again to the old, illusive device of compromise, Clay  being the leader as usual. He brought forward his \"Omnibus Bill,\" so  called because it threw a sop to everybody. It failed to pass as a  single measure, but was broken up and enacted piecemeal. Stubborn was  the fight. Radicals of the one part would consent to nothing short of  extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific; those of the  other stood solidly for the unmodified proviso.    In this crisis occurred President Taylor's death, July 9, 1850, which  was most unfortunate. He was known not to favor the pro-slavery  aggression which, in spite of Clay's personal leaning in the opposite  direction, the omnibus bill embodied. Mr. Fillmore, as also Webster,  whom he made his Secretary of State, nervous with fear of an  anti-slavery reputation, went fully Clay's length. The debate on this  compromise of 1850 was the occasion when Webster deserted the free-soil  principles which were now dominant in New England. His celebrated speech  of March. 7th marked the crisis of his life. He argued that the proviso  was not needed to prevent slavery in the newly gotten district, while  its passage would be a wanton provocation to the South From this moment  Massachusetts dropped him. When she next elected a senator for a full  term, it was Charles Sumner, candidate of the united Democrats and  Free-soilers, who went to Congress pledged to fight slavery to the  death.    But the omnibus compromises were passed. California was, indeed,  admitted free, September 9, 1850--the thirty-first State in order--and  slave-trade in the District of Columbia slightly alleviated. On the  other hand, Texas was stretched to include a huge piece of New Mexico  that was free before, and paid $10,000,000 to relinquish further claims.  This was virtually a bonus to holders of her scrip, which from seventeen  cents the dollar instantly rose to par. New Mexico and Utah were to be  organized as Territories without the proviso, and were made powerless to  legislate on slavery till they should become States. Least sufferable, a  fugitive slave law was passed, so Draconian that that of 1793, hitherto  in force, was benign in comparison. It placed the entire power of the  general Government at the slave-hunter's disposal, and ordered rendition  without trial or grant of habeas corpus, on a certificate to be had by  simple affidavit. Bystanders, if bidden, were obliged to help marshals,  and tremendous penalties imposed for aid to fugitives.    This act facilitated the recovery of fugitives at first, but not  permanently. Many who had labored for its passage soon saw that it was a  mistake. It powerfully fanned the abolition flame all over the North.  New personal liberty laws were enacted. A daily increasing number  adopted the view that the new act was unconstitutional, on the ground  that the Constitution places the rendition of slaves as of criminals in  the hands of States, and guarantees jury trial, even upon title to  property, if over twenty dollars in value. After the act had been  justified in the courts, multitudes of moderate northern men urged to a  dangerous degree the doctrine of state rights in defence of the liberty  laws. Others adopted the cry of the \"higher law,\" and without joining  Garrison in denouncing the Government, did not hesitate to oppose in  every possible way the operation of this drastic legislation for  slave-catching.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Millard Fillmore.  From a painting by Carpenter in 1853, at the City Hall, New York.      The country's growth made escape from bondage continually easier and  easier. Once across the border a runaway was sure to find many friends  and few enemies. Openly, or, if this was required, by stealth, he was  passed quickly along to the Canada line. Between 1830 and 1860 over  30,000 slaves are estimated to have taken refuge in Canada. By 1850,  probably no less than 20,000 had found homes in the free States. The new  law moved many of these across into the British dominions. It was hence  increasingly difficult for the slave-owner to recover stray property.  All possible legal obstructions were placed in his way, and when these  failed he was likely still to be opposed by a mob which might prove too  powerful for the marshal and any posse which he could gather.      [Illustration: Three angry men looking out a window at crowd of citizens  and soldiers in large plaza.]  The Rendition of Anthony Burns in Boston.      In Boston, when a slave named Shadrach was arrested, his friends made a  sudden dash, rescued him from the officers and freed him. With Simms the  same was attempted, but in vain.  The removal of Anthony Burns from that  city in 1855 was possible only by escorting him down State Street to the  revenue cutter in waiting, inside a dense hollow square of United States  artillerymen and marines, with the whole city's militia under arms and  at hand. Business houses as well as residences were closed and draped in  mourning. It was an indignity which Massachusetts never forgot. At  Alton, Ill., slave-hunters seized a respectable colored woman, long  resident there, who fully believed herself free. She was surrounded by  an infuriated company of citizens, and would have been wrenched from her  captors' clutch had not they, in their terror, offered to sell her back  into freedom. The needed $1,200 was raised in a few minutes, and the  agonized creature restored to her family. Judge Davis, whom the evidence  had compelled to deliver the woman, on rendering the sentence resigned  his commission, declaring: \"The law gives you your victim. Thank it and  not me, and may God have mercy on your sinful souls.\"        CHAPTER V.    THE FIGHT FOR KANSAS    [1850-1854]    The measures of 1850 proved anything but the \"finality\" upon slavery  discussion which both parties, the Whigs as loudly as the Democrats,  promised and insisted that they should be. Elated by its victory in  1850, and also by that of 1852, when the anti-slavery sentiment of  northern Whigs drove so many of their old southern allies to vote for  Pierce, giving him his triumphant election, the slavocracy in 1854  proceeded in its work of suicide to undo the sacred Missouri Compromise  of 1820. Douglas, the ablest northern Democrat, led in this, succeeding,  as official pacificator between North and South, somewhat to the office  of Clay, who had died June 29, 1852. The aim of most who were with him  was to make Kansas-Nebraska slave soil, but we may believe that Douglas  himself cherished the hope and conviction that freedom was its destiny.    This rich country west and northwest of Missouri, consecrated to freedom  by the Missouri Compromise, had been slowly filling with civilized men.  It did not"]]]
