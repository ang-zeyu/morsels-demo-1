The Zulu nodded; and Dinny looked from one to the other with such a look  of hopeless dread in his countenance, that even Mr Rogers could not  forbear to smile.    \"Sure it's the onsafest place I iver came noigh, sor; and it's not  meself that will stir away from the front of the waggon till that great  baste is killed.\"    The General's account of his proceedings, and his conversation as a  rule, was not in the plainest of English, so it is more convenient to  give it in ordinary colloquial form; but he was very earnest, and tried  hard to make himself understood.    When Mr Rogers consulted him as to the best means of getting rid of so  unpleasant a follower, the Zulu said that the only way would be to ride  on in front of the waggon, and then suddenly strike off to right or  left, form a wide curve, and ride inward so as to strike the track of  the waggon quite a mile behind.    By this means, the General said, they would probably get a shot at the  monster as he was crawling furtively after the horses, and probably  bring it down.    \"It is a risk,\" said Mr Rogers thoughtfully; \"but it will be impossible  for us to go on with an enemy like that always in our wake.\"    \"When do you think he will try to attack us, General?\" said Dick.    \"When the sun has gone down, Boss, and the horses and oxen are having  their evening feed.\"    \"And he might take my beautiful Shoes,\" said Dick.    \"Or my lovely old Stockings,\" cried Jack, quite unconscious of how  absurd his words sounded.    \"We shall have to follow out the Zulu's plan, my boys,\" said Mr Rogers;  \"and the sooner we try the better.\"    The midday halt was called by a beautifully transparent pool of water,  where some richly succulent grass awaited the cattle, and which for some  hours they cropped, the heat being intense, and any object exposed to  the full power of the sun soon becoming hot enough to burn the hand.    Hot as it was, Dinny, being assured that the lion was not likely to  attack in open daylight, lit a roaring fire, and soon had the pot  simmering with its rich thick meat gravy, a basin round of which, and a  portion of a cake made and baked upon an iron plate brought for the  purpose, formed their dinner.    Then there was a siesta, and at last, the most fiery hours being gone  by, broad-brimmed straw hats were taken from the waggon--for it was  still intensely hot--and the Zulu undertaking to lead the team on  between two mountains through which the broad valley ran, the horses  were saddled, rifles taken, and father and sons mounted to go on what  might prove to be a very dangerous adventure.    The first thing done was to carefully take in the bearings of the  country, and then, after a few words of advice from the General--whom  Mr Rogers would have liked to have, only his presence was necessary  with the waggon, he being the most trustworthy of their followers--they  rode on at a brisk canter through the crisp long grass, and amongst the  bushes, and always onward towards the head of the valley, where,  towering up, stood the twin mountains, which were like the ends of a  couple of ridges or chains.    Scrupulously following out the General's advice, they struck off to the  left, and taking quite a two-mile circuit, they saw the waggon crawling  along in the distance, while they cantered on, feeling wonderfully free  and light in spite of the heat, till they were a long distance behind  the waggon, when they halted and carefully swept the surface of the  country.    \"Nothing in sight,\" said Mr Rogers.    \"I hope we shan't have our trip for nothing, father,\" replied Dick.    \"Are you eager to meet with the lion, then?\" said his father, smiling.    \"I don't know, father; but I should like to shoot him,\" replied Dick  quietly.    \"Well, my boys, I hope we shall shoot the animal; and as we are now a  couple of miles at least behind the waggon, if he is following it he  should be before us now, so come along.\"    Rifles were cocked, and every eye carefully scrutinised the dry  drabby-yellow grass through which the lion would be stealing its way,  and so much like the withered stems in colour that, unless moving, it  was quite possible to miss seeing such a creature as they rode along.    The plan arranged was, that no sooner was the lion sighted than they  were all to dismount, and fire as opportunity occurred, loading again as  rapidly as possible for a second shot.    But though they followed steadily on in the waggon track, riding all  three abreast, and scanning every clump and bush, they had approached  the bend of the valley without seeing anything but a few bok, which  offered tempting marks now that they did not want to shoot.    The waggon had evidently passed through the opening, for it was quite  out of sight, and the sinking sun was casting long shadows.  So at last  Mr Rogers grew impatient and spoke out,--    \"We had better ride on, my boys, and catch the waggon.  I want to halt  early and form a good stout fence for our protection.  We shall see  no--\"    \"Lion!\" said Dick sharply.  \"Dismount.\"    He threw himself from his horse on the instant, and stood ready to fire,  his father and brother imitating his example.    \"Where?\" said Mr Rogers quietly.  \"I see nothing, Dick.\"    \"There,\" replied Dick, \"fifty yards away, stealing through those thick  sedgy grasses.  Don't you see?\"    \"Yes,\" said his father, \"I see the monster now.  Keep cool, boys, and  make your shots tell.  If he is wounded and charges, you must stand firm  and fire again.\"    Mr Rogers waited a few moments, during which the lion, a monstrous  yellow, maneless fellow, was half-crawling, half-creeping, through the  long sedgy grass; and at last he showed so plainly that Mr Rogers took  careful aim, fired, and evidently hit, for the lion uttered a furious  roar, and made a tremendous bound to escape, with the result that Dick's  cob started, and threatened to dash off; but a few words from its master  calmed it; and taking advantage of the good view he had of the lion,  Dick now fired, a shot from Jack's rifle following directly after.  But,  so far from the monster being crippled, it ceased its efforts to escape,  and turning, took a few steps forward, crouched like a cat, and then  bounded at Jack.    \"Stand firm and fire!\" cried Mr Rogers.    Jack obeyed, and as he fired the lion was in the air launching itself at  him, but falling short, rolling over upon its side, and beginning to  tear and gnaw at the dry grass in its death agony.    Mr Rogers approached, but drew back in favour of Dick.    \"Go and give it the _coup de grace_, my boy,\" he said.  \"You may as well  have the honour of killing the monster, for a monster it is.\"    Dick had replaced his empty cartridge with a full one, and was  approaching boldly to fire the necessary shot, when, to his horror and  astonishment, the lion rose, crouched, and showed its glistening teeth.  But in spite of the terror that seized him he stood firm, took careful  aim, fired, and with a savage roar, the lion rolled over, dead.    It was indeed a monster, and its glistening fangs were very long, while  upon examination there was the mark of Jack's last night's bullet, which  had ploughed up the skin between the creature's ears, though the wound  was now half dry.    The shots brought the Zulu into sight with his boys, for the waggon was  halting at a pleasant spring at the foot of one of the mountains not a  mile away, for here were wood and a good place for forming a kraal.    The General and his sons raced down, and the boys danced round the lion  and called it names.  But there was no time to lose, and it was  impossible to stop and skin the animal that night, so the General stuck  some branches round it, and then led the way to camp, which was rapidly  formed.  And though they heard lions in the distance, they had a less  disturbed night than the preceding one, greatly to the satisfaction of  all, especially Dinny, who declared that it was a blessing that the lion  was killed, for now they would be at peace.    But Dinny was wrong, for there were other lions in the land.        CHAPTER FIFTEEN.    GOOD PRACTICE FOR GUNNERS.    The day had hardly broken before Coffee and Chicory were shouting at the  opening of the waggon for Boss Dick and Boss Jack to \"come and 'kin a  lion.\"    They wanted but little rousing up, and after a good souse in the pure  cool spring, that ran bubbling over and amongst some rocks with  delicious-looking broad-fronded ferns drooping gracefully over, they  went and rubbed their horses' muzzles, patted their arched necks, and  gave each a taste of sugar--for which Shoes and Stockings regularly  looked now, and would follow their masters like dogs to obtain--they  shouldered their rifles, and followed the General to the place where the  lion lay.    Rested and refreshed, everything around looked lovely, for they were at  the head of a very fertile valley, where flowers bloomed in profusion,  and the springs that rose in the sides of the mountains sent down  moisture enough to keep miles of the country round of a perpetual green.    \"Plenty game here,\" said Chicory, pointing to a bare, muddy spot by a  water-hole.    The General turned aside, and stooped down to look at the hundreds of  footprints in the soft mud.    \"Koodoo,\" he said, \"eland, buffalo, bok, wildebeeste, quagga, zebra,  lion,\" and he pointed out in turn the spoor, or footprints, of the  various beasts he named.  \"Yes, plenty of game here.\"    As they went on, the boys noticed the abundance of the pretty little  whidah bird, a lovely little creature, about the size of a lark, but  with a tail of such enormous length that in a breeze the power of the  wind upon the tail drives the bird to take flight into shelter, so that  it shall not be blown away.

[Illustration: Bearskin Cap on a Ramrod 125]    Lewis Wetzel had two brothers only less famous than himself in the  backwoods warfare, and more than once Indian fighting seems to have run  in families. Adam Poe and Andrew Poe were brothers whose names have  come down in the story of deadly combats with the savages. They are most  renowned for their heroic struggle with a party of seven Wyandots near  the mouth of Little Yellow Creek, in 1782. The Wyandots, led by a great  warrior named Big Foot, had fallen suddenly on a settlement just below  Fort Pitt, killed one old man in his cabin, and begun their retreat with  what booty they could gather. Eight borderers, the two Poes among them,  followed in hot haste across the river into the Ohio country, where the  next morning Andrew Poe came suddenly on Big Foot and a small warrior  talking together by their raft at the water's edge. They stood with  their guns cocked, and Poe aimed at Big Foot; but his piece missed fire.  The Indians turned at the click of the lock, and Poe, who was too close  to them for any chance of escape, leaped upon them both and threw them  to the ground together. The little warrior freed himself, and got his  tomahawk from the raft to brain Poe, whom he left in deadly clutch with  Big Foot. Twice he struck, but Poe managed each time, by twisting and  dodging, to keep his head away from the hatchet, and as the warrior  struck the third time, Poe, though badly hurt on the arm by one of  his blows, wrenched himself free from Big Foot, caught up one of the  Indians' guns, and shot the little warrior through the breast. Then  Big Foot seized him again, and they floundered together into the water,  where each tried to drown the other. Poe held Big Foot under the water  so long that he thought he must be dead, but the moment he loosed his  hold upon his scalp lock, the Wyandot renewed the fight. They presently  found themselves in water beyond their depths, and let go to swim for  their lives. The Indian reached the shore first, and got hold of one of  the guns to shoot Poe, but luckily for Poe it was the gun he had fired  in killing the little warrior.    Adam had heard the shot, and he now came hurrying up. His gun was empty,  too, and it was a question Whether he or Big Foot should load first: he  shot the Indian as he was lifting his gun to fire. But Big Foot was  not killed, and Andrew shouted to Adam not to mind him, but to keep the  Indian from rolling himself into the water. Big Foot was too quick for  them: he got into the current, which whirled him away, and so saved his  scalp in death. About the same time another of the party who came up  took Andrew Poe for an Indian and shot him in the shoulder. Poe got  well of his wounds and lived for many years, proud of his fight with Big  Foot, who was a generous foe, and had often befriended white captives  among his tribe.    It is told of Adam Poe that five Indians, all rather drunk, once came to  his cabin, and tried to force the door open. He sent his wife with the  children out into the cornfield behind the house, remarking, \"There is a  fight and fun ahead,\" but when he saw the state the Indians were in, he  did not fire at them. He fell upon them with his fists, knocked them all  down, and then threw them one after another over the fence, and the fun  was ended.    One of the hunters detailed from Wayne's command to supply the officers  with game while the army lay at Greenville in 1793 was the Indian  fighter, Josiah Hunt, who died a peaceful Methodist many years  afterwards. When he passed a winter in the woods he had to build a fire  to keep from freezing, and yet guard against letting the slightest gleam  of light be seen by a prowling foe. So he dug a hole six or seven inches  deep with his tomahawk, filled it with the soft lining of dead oak bark,  and with his flint started a fire. He left two holes at the edges to  breathe the flame; then covered the pit with earth, spread brush over  it, and seated himself on the heap, with his blanket drawn over his  head, and dozed through the night. The Indians had a great honor and  admiration for him, and when they came to make peace at Greenville,  after Fallen Timbers, they all wanted to see Captain Hunt. \"Great man,  Captain Hunt,\" they said. \"Great warrior--good hunting man-Indian no can  kill,\" and they told him they had tried to find out the secret of his  fire, and catch him off his guard so that they could get his scalp,  which they felt would have been the highest distinction they could have  achieved, next to getting General Wayne's scalp. He was indeed both  hunted and hunter. He never fired at a deer without first putting a  bullet in his mouth to reload for an Indian, who might be about to fire  on him. When he skinned a deer, he planted his back against a tree, and  stood his rifle by his side; from time to time he stopped and  listened for the slightest noise that hinted danger. His life had its  disappointments as well as its perils. Once he saw three Indians whom he  might easily have killed at one shot if he could have got them in range,  but they persisted in walking Indian file. If he fired and killed only  one, the other two would have killed him; so he was obliged to let them  all go. Captain Hunt was a quiet, modest man, very frank and sincere,  and seems never to have boasted of his exploits; we have no means of  knowing whether he was glad or sorry that those Indians got away in  safety. Probably he was not very glad; for though the fighters on both  sides could admire, they could never spare one another.    The Indian fighters were commoner in the southern and eastern parts of  Ohio than in the north, but there was at least one whose chief exploit  had the north for its scene. Captain Samuel Brady, in 1780, gathered a  number of his neighbors and pursued a retreating war party of Indians  from the Ohio as far as the Cuyahoga, near Ravenna. Here he found that  the savages far outnumbered his force, and he decided that it would be  better for him to retreat in his turn, and he bade each of his men look  out for himself. He discovered that the Indians were pressing him hard  with the purpose of taking him alive and glutting many an old grudge  against him by torture. But he knew his ground, for he had often hunted  there with them in friendlier days, and he saw a chance for his life at  a point where another man would have despaired. This was where the river  narrowed to a gorge twenty feet wide, with walls of precipitous rock. As  he neared this chasm in his flight, Brady gathered himself for the  leap and cleared it. He caught at some low bushes where he alighted and  pulled himself up the steep, while the Indians stood stupefied. They had  now no hope of taking him alive, and they all fired upon him. One bullet  wounded him badly in the hip, but he managed to swim a pond which he  came to, and to hide himself behind a log near the shore. When the  Indians came up and saw the blood on its surface, they decided that he  was drowned, and gave up the chase. Some of them stood on the very log  that hid him while they talked over his probable fate, and then they  left him to make his long way home unmolested.    Duncan McArthur, an early governor of Ohio, though not an Indian fighter  like these others, was in many fights with the Indians. In the summer of  1794 he was hunting deer in the hills near the mouth of the Scioto, when  two Indians fully armed came in sight. McArthur was waiting for the deer  behind a screen or blind near the salt lick which they frequented, and  he took aim at one of the Indians and shot him. The other did not stir  till McArthur broke from his covert and ran. He plunged heedlessly into  the top of a fallen tree, and before he could disentangle himself, he  heard the crack of the Indian's rifle, and the bullet hissed close  to his ear. He freed himself and ran, followed now by several other  Indians, but he managed to distance them all and reached the Ohio River  in safety.    It was war to the death between the red and white borderers. Neither  spared the other, except in some rare mood of caprice or pity. A life  granted on either side meant perhaps many lives lost, and the foes vied  with one another in being the first to shed the blood which seems, as  you read their savage annals, to stain every acre of the beautiful Ohio  country.          XIV. LATER CAPTIVITIES.    The Indians seem to have kept on carrying the whites into captivity,  to the very end of the war, which closed with the Greenville treaty  of 1795. As they had always done, they adopted some of them into their  tribes and devoted others to torture. Nothing more clearly shows how  little they realized that their power was coming to an end, and that  they could no longer live their old life, or follow their immemorial  customs.    The first captive in Ohio, of whom there is any record, was Mary Harris;  she had been stolen from her home in New England when a child, by the  French Indians, and was found at White Woman Creek in Coshocton County,  about the year 1750. When the last captive was taken is not certainly  known, but two white boys were captured so late as 1791, and one of  these was adopted by the Delawares in Auglaize County. His name was  Brickell, and he was carried off from the neighborhood of Pittsburg when  nine years old. He wrote a narrative of his life among the Indians, and  gave an account of his parting with them which is very touching. After  the first exchange of prisoners Brickell was left because there was  no Indian among the whites to exchange for him, but later his adoptive  father went with him to Fort Defiance, and gave him up. Brickell had  hunted with the rest of the children, and shared in all their sports and  pleasures, and they now clung about him crying, when their father told  them he must go with"]]]
