He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent person; but he  had polite manners and a pleasant smile. He inquired how we were left,  and on finding that we were very poor he suggested that I should come  and teach music to his only daughter, aged ten. I said that I did not  like to leave my mother, on which he suggested that I should go home  to her every week-end, and he offered me a hundred a year, which was  certainly splendid pay. So it ended by my accepting, and I went down  to Chiltern Grange, about six miles from Farnham. Mr. Carruthers was  a widower, but he had engaged a lady-housekeeper, a very respectable,  elderly person, called Mrs. Dixon, to look after his establishment. The  child was a dear, and everything promised well. Mr. Carruthers was very  kind and very musical, and we had most pleasant evenings together. Every  week-end I went home to my mother in town.    \"The first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the red-moustached  Mr. Woodley. He came for a visit of a week, and oh, it seemed three  months to me! He was a dreadful person, a bully to everyone else, but to  me something infinitely worse. He made odious love to me, boasted of his  wealth, said that if I married him I would have the finest diamonds in  London, and finally, when I would have nothing to do with him, he seized  me in his arms one day after dinner--he was hideously strong--and he  swore that he would not let me go until I had kissed him. Mr. Carruthers  came in and tore him off from me, on which he turned upon his own host,  knocking him down and cutting his face open. That was the end of his  visit, as you can imagine. Mr. Carruthers apologized to me next day,  and assured me that I should never be exposed to such an insult again. I  have not seen Mr. Woodley since.    \"And now, Mr. Holmes, I come at last to the special thing which has  caused me to ask your advice to-day. You must know that every Saturday  forenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farnham Station in order to get the  12.22 to town. The road from Chiltern Grange is a lonely one, and at  one spot it is particularly so, for it lies for over a mile between  Charlington Heath upon one side and the woods which lie round  Charlington Hall upon the other. You could not find a more lonely tract  of road anywhere, and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart, or a  peasant, until you reach the high road near Crooksbury Hill. Two  weeks ago I was passing this place when I chanced to look back over my  shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind me I saw a man, also on a  bicycle. He seemed to be a middle-aged man, with a short, dark beard. I  looked back before I reached Farnham, but the man was gone, so I thought  no more about it. But you can imagine how surprised I was, Mr. Holmes,  when on my return on the Monday I saw the same man on the same stretch  of road. My astonishment was increased when the incident occurred again,  exactly as before, on the following Saturday and Monday. He always kept  his distance and did not molest me in any way, but still it certainly  was very odd. I mentioned it to Mr. Carruthers, who seemed interested in  what I said, and told me that he had ordered a horse and trap, so  that in future I should not pass over these lonely roads without some  companion.    \"The horse and trap were to have come this week, but for some reason  they were not delivered, and again I had to cycle to the station.  That was this morning. You can think that I looked out when I came to  Charlington Heath, and there, sure enough, was the man, exactly as he  had been the two weeks before. He always kept so far from me that I  could not clearly see his face, but it was certainly someone whom I did  not know. He was dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap. The only thing  about his face that I could clearly see was his dark beard. To-day I was  not alarmed, but I was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find  out who he was and what he wanted. I slowed down my machine, but he  slowed down his. Then I stopped altogether, but he stopped also. Then  I laid a trap for him. There is a sharp turning of the road, and I  pedalled very quickly round this, and then I stopped and waited. I  expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop. But he  never appeared. Then I went back and looked round the corner. I  could see a mile of road, but he was not on it. To make it the more  extraordinary, there was no side road at this point down which he could  have gone.\"    Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. \"This case certainly presents  some features of its own,\" said he. \"How much time elapsed between your  turning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear?\"    \"Two or three minutes.\"    \"Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there  are no side roads?\"    \"None.\"    \"Then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other.\"    \"It could not have been on the side of the heath or I should have seen  him.\"    \"So by the process of exclusion we arrive at the fact that he made his  way towards Charlington Hall, which, as I understand, is situated in its  own grounds on one side of the road. Anything else?\"    \"Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I was so perplexed that I felt I should  not be happy until I had seen you and had your advice.\"    Holmes sat in silence for some little time.    \"Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?\" he asked, at last.    \"He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at Coventry.\"    \"He would not pay you a surprise visit?\"    \"Oh, Mr. Holmes! As if I should not know him!\"    \"Have you had any other admirers?\"    \"Several before I knew Cyril.\"    \"And since?\"    \"There was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you can call him an admirer.\"    \"No one else?\"    Our fair client seemed a little confused.    \"Who was he?\" asked Holmes.    \"Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it has seemed to me sometimes  that my employer, Mr. Carruthers, takes a great deal of interest in me.  We are thrown rather together. I play his accompaniments in the evening.  He has never said anything. He is a perfect gentleman. But a girl always  knows.\"    \"Ha!\" Holmes looked grave. \"What does he do for a living?\"    \"He is a rich man.\"    \"No carriages or horses?\"    \"Well, at least he is fairly well-to-do. But he goes into the City two  or three times a week. He is deeply interested in South African gold  shares.\"    \"You will let me know any fresh development, Miss Smith. I am very busy  just now, but I will find time to make some inquiries into your case. In  the meantime take no step without letting me know. Good-bye, and I trust  that we shall have nothing but good news from you.\"    \"It is part of the settled order of Nature that such a girl should have  followers,\" said Holmes, as he pulled at his meditative pipe, \"but for  choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads. Some secretive lover,  beyond all doubt. But there are curious and suggestive details about the  case, Watson.\"    \"That he should appear only at that point?\"    \"Exactly. Our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of  Charlington Hall. Then, again, how about the connection between  Carruthers and Woodley, since they appear to be men of such a different  type? How came they BOTH to be so keen upon looking up Ralph Smith's  relations? One more point. What sort of a MENAGE is it which pays double  the market price for a governess, but does not keep a horse although six  miles from the station? Odd, Watson--very odd!\"    \"You will go down?\"    \"No, my dear fellow, YOU will go down. This may be some trifling  intrigue, and I cannot break my other important research for the sake  of it. On Monday you will arrive early at Farnham; you will conceal  yourself near Charlington Heath; you will observe these facts for  yourself, and act as your own judgment advises. Then, having inquired as  to the occupants of the Hall, you will come back to me and report. And  now, Watson, not another word of the matter until we have a few solid  stepping-stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution.\"    We had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the Monday by  the train which leaves Waterloo at 9.50, so I started early and caught  the 9.13. At Farnham Station I had no difficulty in being directed to  Charlington Heath. It was impossible to mistake the scene of the young  lady's adventure, for the road runs between the open heath on one side  and an old yew hedge upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded  with magnificent trees. There was a main gateway of lichen-studded  stone, each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems; but  besides this central carriage drive I observed several points where  there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them. The house  was invisible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and  decay.    The heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse, gleaming  magnificently in the light of the bright spring sunshine. Behind one of  these clumps I took up my position, so as to command both the gateway  of the Hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side. It had been  deserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the  opposite direction to that in which I had come. He was clad in a dark  suit, and I saw that he had a black beard. On reaching the end of the  Charlington grounds he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap  in the hedge, disappearing from my view.    A quarter of an hour passed and then a second cyclist appeared. This  time it was the young lady coming from the station. I saw her look  about her as she came to the Charlington hedge. An instant later the man  emerged from his hiding-place, sprang upon his cycle, and followed  her. In all the broad landscape those were the only moving figures, the  graceful girl sitting very"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22101"],[0,"Wood Folk at School (#17)"],[1," whether he ever had the discipline of the school of the woods.  Whether he rolls himself into a chestnut bur by instinct, as the possum  plays dead, or whether that is a matter of slow learning is yet to be  discovered. Whether his dense stupidity, Which disarms his enemies and  brings him safe out of a hundred dangers where wits would fail, is,  like the possum's blank idiocy, only a mask for the deepest wisdom; or  whether he is quite as stupid as he acts and looks, is also a question.    More and more I incline to the former possibility. He has learned  unconsciously the strength of lying still. A thousand generations of fat  and healthy porcupines have taught him the folly of trouble and rush and  worry in a world that somebody else has planned, and for which somebody  else is plainly responsible. So he makes no effort and lives in profound  peace. But this also leaves you with a question which may take you  overseas to explore Hindu philosophy. Indeed, if you have one question  when you meet Unk Wunk for the first time, you will have twenty after  you have studied him for a season or two. His paragraph in the woods'  journal begins and ends with a question mark, and a dash for what is  left unsaid.    The only indication of deliberate plan and effort that I have ever noted  in Unk Wunk was in regard to teaching two young ones the simple art of  swimming,--which porcupines, by the way, rarely use, and for which there  seems to be no necessity. I was drifting along the shore in my canoe  when I noticed a mother porcupine and two little ones, a prickly pair  indeed, on a log that reached out into the lake. She had brought them  there to make her task of weaning them more easy by giving them a taste  of lily buds. When they had gathered and eaten all the buds and stems  that they could reach, she deliberately pushed both little ones into the  water. When they attempted to scramble back she pushed them off again,  and dropped in beside them and led them to a log farther down the shore,  where there were more lily pads.    The numerous hollow quills floated them high in the water, like so many  corks, and they paddled off with less effort than any other young  animals that I have ever seen in the water. But whether this were a  swimming lesson, or a rude direction to shift and browse for themselves,  is still a question. With the exception of one solitary old genius, who  had an astonishing way of amusing himself and scaring all the other wood  folk, this was the only plain bit of fore-thought and sweet  reasonableness that I have ever found in a porcupine.    [Illustration]          A LAZY FELLOW'S FUN    [Illustration]      A new sound, a purring rustle of leaves, stopped me instantly as I  climbed the beech ridge, one late afternoon, to see what wood folk I  might surprise feeding on the rich mast. _Pr-r-r-r-ush, pr-r-r-r-ush!_ a  curious combination of the rustling of squirrels' feet and the soft,  crackling purr of an eagle's wings, growing nearer, clearer every  instant. I slipped quietly behind the nearest tree to watch and listen.    Something was coming down the hill; but what? It was not an animal  running. No animal that I knew, unless he had gone suddenly crazy, would  ever make such a racket to tell everybody where he was. It was not  squirrels playing, nor grouse scratching among the new-fallen leaves.  Their alternate rustlings and silences are unmistakable. It was not a  bear shaking down the ripe beechnuts--not heavy enough for that, yet too  heavy for the feet of any prowler of the woods to make on his stealthy  hunting. _Pr-r-r-r-ush, swish! thump!_ Something struck the stem of a  bush heavily and brought down a rustling shower of leaves; then out from  under the low branches rolled something that I had never seen before,--a  heavy, grayish ball, as big as a half-bushel basket, so covered over  with leaves that one could not tell what was inside. It was as if some  one had covered a big kettle with glue and sent it rolling down the  hill, picking up dead leaves as it went. So the queer thing tumbled past  my feet, purring, crackling, growing bigger and more ragged every moment  as it gathered up more leaves, till it reached the bottom of a sharp  pitch and lay still.    I stole after it cautiously. Suddenly it moved, unrolled itself. Then  out of the ragged mass came a big porcupine. He shook himself,  stretched, wobbled around a moment, as if his long roll had made him  dizzy; then he meandered aimlessly along the foot of the ridge, his  quills stuck full of dead leaves, looking big and strange enough to  frighten anything that might meet him in the woods.    Here was a new trick, a new problem concerning one of the stupidest of  all the wood folk. When you meet a porcupine and bother him, he usually  rolls himself into a huge pincushion with all its points outward, covers  his face with his thorny tail, and lies still, knowing well that you  cannot touch him anywhere without getting the worst of it. Now had he  been bothered by some animal and rolled himself up where it was so steep  that he lost his balance, and so tumbled unwillingly down the long hill;  or, with his stomach full of sweet beechnuts, had he rolled down lazily  to avoid the trouble of walking; or is Unk Wunk brighter than he looks  to discover the joy of roller coasting and the fun of feeling dizzy  afterwards?    There was nothing on the hill above, no rustle or suggestion of any  hunting animal to answer the question; so I followed Unk Wunk on his  aimless wanderings along the foot of the ridge.    A slight movement far ahead caught my eye, and I saw a hare gliding and  dodging among the brown ferns. He came slowly in our direction, hopping  and halting and wiggling his nose at every bush, till he heard our  approach and rose on his hind legs to listen. He gave a great jump as  Unk Wunk hove into sight, covered all over with the dead leaves that  his barbed quills had picked up on his way downhill, and lay quiet where  he thought the ferns would hide him.    The procession drew nearer. Moktaques, full of curiosity, lifted his  head cautiously out of the ferns and sat up straight on his haunches  again, his paws crossed, his eyes shining in fear and curiosity at the  strange animal rustling along and taking the leaves with him. For a  moment wonder held him as still as the stump beside him; then he bolted  into the bush in a series of high, scared jumps, and I heard him  scurrying crazily in a half circle around us.    [Illustration]    Unk Wunk gave no heed to the interruption, but yew-yawed hither and yon  after his stupid nose. Like every other porcupine that I have followed,  he seemed to have nothing whatever to do, and nowhere in the wide world  to go. He loafed along lazily, too full to eat any of the beechnuts  that he nosed daintily out of the leaves. He tried a bit of bark here  and there, only to spit it out again. Once he started up the hill; but  it was too steep for a lazy fellow with a full stomach. Again he tried  it; but it was not steep enough to roll down afterwards. Suddenly he  turned and came back to see who it was that followed him about.    I kept very quiet, and he brushed two or three times past my legs,  eyeing me sleepily. Then he took to nosing a beechnut from under my  foot, as if I were no more interesting than Alexander was to Diogenes.    I had never made friends with a porcupine,--he is too briery a fellow  for intimacies,--but now with a small stick I began to search him  gently, wondering if, under all that armor of spears and brambles, I  might not find a place where it would please him to be scratched. At the  first touch he rolled himself together, all his spears sticking straight  out on every side, like a huge chestnut bur. One could not touch him  anywhere without being pierced by a dozen barbs. Gradually, however, as  the stick touched him gently and searched out the itching spots under  his armor, he unrolled himself and put his nose under my foot again. He  did not want the beechnut; but he did want to nose it out. Unk Wunk is  like a pig. He has very few things to do besides eating; but when he  does start to go anywhere or do anything he always does it. Then I bent  down to touch him with my hand.    That was a mistake. He felt the difference in the touch instantly. Also  he smelled the salt in my hand, for a taste of which Unk Wunk will put  aside all his laziness and walk a mile, if need be. He tried to grasp  the hand, first with his paws, then with his mouth; but I had too much  fear of his great cutting teeth to let him succeed. Instead I touched  him behind the ears, feeling my way gingerly through the thick tangle of  spines, testing them cautiously to see how easily they would pull out.    The quills were very loosely set in, and every arrowheaded barb was as  sharp as a needle. Anything that pressed against them roughly would  surely be pierced; the spines would pull out of the skin, and work their  way rapidly into the unfortunate hand or paw or nose that touched them.  Each spine was like a South Sea Islander's sword, set for half its  length with shark's teeth. Once in the flesh it would work its own way,  unless pulled out with a firm hand spite of pain and terrible  laceration. No wonder Unk Wunk has no fear or anxiety when he rolls  himself into a ball, protected at every point by such terrible weapons.    The hand moved very cautiously as it went down his side, within reach of  Unk Wunk's one swift weapon. There were thousands of the spines, rough  as a saw's edge, crossing each other in every direction, yet with every  point outward. Unk Wunk was irritated, probably, because he could not  have the salt he wanted. As the hand came within range, his tail snapped  back like lightning. I was watching for the blow, but was not half quick  enough. At the rustling snap, like the voice of a steel trap, I jerked  my hand away. Two of his tail spines came with it;"]]]
