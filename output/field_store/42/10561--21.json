[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20778"],[0,"Sylva; Or, A Discourse of Forest Trees. Vol. 1 (of 2) (#17)"],[1," the good old _Laertes_. Here then upon the Complaint of learned  Persons and great Travellers, deploring the loss of many rare and  precious Things, _Trees_ and _Plants_, especially instancing the  _Balsam_-Tree of _Gilead_ (now almost, if not altogether failing, and no  more to be found where it grew in great plenty.) He applys himself to  young _Eperous_, to consider it seriously, and to fall a planting while  time is before them, with this incouraging Exclamation, _Agite, o  Adolescentes, & antequam canities vobis obrepat, stirpes jam alueritis,  quae vobis cum insigni utilitate, delectationem etiam adferent: Nam  quemadmodum canities temporis successu, vobis insciis, sensim obrepit:  Sic natura vobis inserviens educabit quod telluri vestrae concredetis,  modo prima initia illi dederitis_, &c. Pet. Bellonius _De neglecta  stirpium Cultura_. Problema ix.    My next _Advice_ is, that they do not easily commit themselves to the  _Dictates_ of their ignorant _Hinds_ and _Servants_,{lxxix:1} who are  (generally speaking) more fit to Learn than to Instruct. _Male agitur cum  Domino quem Villicus docet_, was an Observation of old _Cato_'s; and 'twas  _Ischomachus_ who told _Socrates_ (discoursing one day upon a like  subject) _That it was far easier to _Make_, than to _Find_ a good  Husband-man_: I have often prov'd it so in _Gardeners_; and I believe it  will hold in most of our _Country_ Employments: Country People  universally know that all Trees consist of _Roots_, _Stems_, _Boughs_,  _Leaves_, &c. but can give no account of the _Species_, _Virtues_, or  farther Culture, besides the making of a Pit or Hole; casting, and  treading in the Earth, &c. which require a deeper search, than they are  capable of: We are then to exact _Labour_, not _Conduct_ and _Reason_,  from the greatest part of them; and the business of _Planting_ is an _Art_  or _Science_ (for so _Varro_ has solemnly defined it;{lxxx:1}) and that  exceedingly wide of Truth, which (it seems) many in his time accounted of  it; _facillimam esse, nec ullius acuminis Rusticationem_,{lxxx:2} namely  that it was an easie and insipid Study. It was the simple _Culture_ only,  with so much difficulty retrieved from the late confusion of an intestine  and bloody _War_, like that of _Ours_, and now put in _Reputation_ again,  which made the noble _Poet_ write,                ........How hard it was      Low Subjects with illustrious words to grace.              ........_Verbis ea vincere magnum      Quam sit, & angustis hunc addere rebus honorem._        Georg. 3.    Seeing, as the _Orator_ does himself express it, _Nihil est homine  libero dignius_; there is nothing more becoming and worthy of a  _Gentleman_, no, not the Majesty of a{lxxx:3} _Consul_. In ancient and  best Times, Men were not honour'd and esteem'd for the only Learned, who  were great _Linguists_, profound _Criticks_, Reader and Devourers of  Books: But such whose Studies consisted of the Discourses, Documents and  Observations of their _Fore-Fathers_, ancient and venerable Persons;  who, (as the excellent Author of the _Rites_ of the _Israelites_,  _cap._ xv, &c. acquaints us,) were oblig'd to Instruct, and Inform their  Children of the wonderful Things God had done for their Ancestors;  together with the Precepts of the _Moral Law_, _Feasts_, and Religious  Ceremonies: But taught them likewise all that concern'd _Agriculture_;  joyn'd with Lessons of perpetual practice; in which they were,  doubtless, exceedingly knowing; whilst during so many Ages, they  employ'd themselves almost continually in it: And tho' now adays this  _noble Art_ be for the most part, left to be exercis'd amongst us, by  People of grosser and unthinking Souls; yet there is no _Science_  whatever, which contains a vaster Compass of Knowledge, infinitely more  useful and beneficial to Mankind, than the fruitless and empty Notions  of the greatest part of _Speculatists_; counted to be the only _Eruditi_  and learned Men. An _Israelite_, who from _Tradition_ of his  Fore-fathers, his own _Experience_, and some modern Reading, had  inform'd himself of the _Religion_ and _Laws_ which were to regulate his  Life; and knew how to procure Things necessary: Who perfectly understood  the several qualities of the _Earth_, _Plants_, and _Places_ agreeable  to each sort, and to cultivate, propagate, defend them from Accidents,  and bring them to Maturity: That also was skill'd in the nature of  _Cattel_, their Food, Diseases, Remedies, &c. which those who amongst us  pass for the most learned and accomplish'd _Gentlemen_, and _Scholars_,  are, for the most part, grosly ignorant of, look upon as _base_,  _rustick_, and things below them: is (in this learned Author's Opinion)  infinitely more to be valued, than a Man brought up either in wrangling  at the _Bar_; or the noisie, and ridiculous Disputes of our _Schools_,  &c. To this Sense the learn'd _Modena_. And 'tis remarkable, that after  all that wise _Solomon_ had said, that _All_ was _vanity and vexation of  Spirit_ (among so many _particulars_ he reckons up,) he should be  altogether _silent_, and say nothing concerning _Husbandry_; as,  doubtless, considering it the most useful, innocent and laudable  Employment of our Life, requiring those who cultivate the Ground to live  in the Country, remote from _City_-Luxury, and the temptation to the  Vices he condemns. It was indeed a plain Man{lxxxii:1} (a _Potter_ by  _Trade_) but let no body despise him because a _Potter_ (_Agathocles_,  and a _King_ was of that _Craft_) who in my Opinion has given us the  true reason why _Husbandry_, and particularly _Planting_, is no more  improved in this Age of ours; especially, where Persons are _Lords_ and  Owners of much _Land_. The truth is, says he, when Men have acquired any  considerable _Fortune_ by their _good Husbandry_, and _experience_  (forgetting that the greatest _Patriarchs_, _Princes_, their _Sons_ and  _Daughters_, belonged to the _Plough_, and the _Flock_) they account it  a _shame_ to breed up their _Children_ in the same Calling which they  themselves were educated in, but presently design them _Gentlemen_: They  must forsooth, have a _Coat_ of _Arms_, and live upon their _Estates_;  So as by the time his _Sons_ Beard is grown, he begins to be asham'd of  his _Father_, and would be ready to defie him, that should upon any  occasion mind him of his _honest Extraction_: And if it chance that the  good Man have other _Children_ to provide for; _This_ must be the  Darling, be bred at _School_, and the _University_, whilst the rest must  to _Cart_ and _Plow_ with the _Father_, &c. This is the _Cause_, says my  _Author_, that our _Lands_ are so ill _Cultivated_ and neglected. Every  body will subsist upon their own _Revenue_, and take their _Pleasure_,  whilst they resign their _Estates_ to be manag'd by the most _Ignorant_,  which are the _Children_ whom they leave at home, or the _Hinds_ to whom  they commit them. When as in _truth_, and in _reason_, the more  _Learning_, the better _Philosophers_, and the greater _Abilities_ they  possess, the _more_, and the _better_ are they _qualified_, to  _Cultivate_, and improve their _Estates_: Methinks this is well and  rationally argued.    And now you have in part what I had to produce in extenuation of this  _Adventure_; that _Animated_ with a _Command_, and Assisted by divers  _Worthy Persons_ (whose _Names_ I am prone to _celebrate_ with all just  _Respects_) I have presumed to cast in my _Symbol_; which, with the rest  that are to follow, may (I hope) be in some degree serviceable to _him_  (who ere the happy _Person_ be) that shall oblige the _World_ with that  compleat _Systeme_ of _Agriculture_, which as yet seems a _desideratum_,  and wanting to its full perfection. It is (I assure you) what is one of  the Principal designs of the _ROYAL SOCIETY_, not in this _Particular_  only, but through all the _Liberal_ and more useful _Arts_; and for  which (in the estimation of all equal _Judges_) it will merit the  greatest of _Encouragements_; that so, at last, what the Learned  _Columella_ has wittily reproached, and complained of, as a defect in  that _Age_ of _his_, concerning _Agriculture_ in general, and is  applicable _here_, may attain its desired _Remedy_ and _Consummation_ in  _This_ of _Ours_.    _Sola enim Res Rustica, quae sine dubitatione proxima, & quasi  consanguinea Sapientiae est, tam discentibus eget, quam magistris: Adhuc  enim Scholas Rhetorum, & Geometrarum, Musicorumque, vel quod magis  mirandum est, contemptissimorum vitiorum officinas, gulosius condiendi  cibos, & luxuriosius fercula struendi, capitumque & capillorum  concinnatores, non solum esse audivi, sed & ipse vidi; Agricolationis  neque Doctores qui se profiterentur, neque Discipulos cognovi._{lxxxiii:1}  But this I leave for our _Peruk'd Gallants_ to interpret, and should now  apply my self to the _Directive_ Part, which I am all this while  bespeaking, if after what I have said in the several _Paragraphs_ of the  ensuing _Discourse_ upon the _Argument_ of _Wood_, (and which in this  _Fourth_ Edition coming _Abroad_ with innumerable _Improvements_, and  _Advantages_ (so furnished, as I hope shall neither reproach the _Author_,  or repent the _Reader_) it might not seem superfluous to have _premised_  any thing _here_ for the Encouragement of so becoming an _Industry_. There  are divers _Learned_, and judicious _Men_ who have _preceded_ Me in this  _Argument_; as many, at least, as have undertaken to Write and Compile  vast _Herbals_, and _Theaters_ of _Plants_; of which we have some of our  own _Country-men_, (especially, the most Industrious and Learned Mr.  _Ray_) who have (boldly I dare affirm it) surpass'd _any_, if not all the  _Foreigners_ that are extant: In _those_ it is you meet with the  _Description_ of the several _Plants_, by _Discourses_, _Figures_,  _Names_, _Places_ of _Growth_; time of _Flourishing_, and their _Medicinal  Virtues_;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#17)"],[1," up His mind to it. But I must,  in justice, confess that His situation was a most difficult one. He must  continue inactive if He would remain perfect, and must act if He would  prove to Himself His own existence. You assure me that He decided  to act. I am willing to believe you, although it was an unpardonable  imprudence on the part of a perfect God. But tell us, Marcus, how He set  about making the world.    MARCUS. Those who, without being Christians, possess, like Hermodorus  and Zenothemis, the principles of knowledge, are aware that God did not  create the world personally without an intermediary. He gave birth to an  only Son, by whom all things were made.    HERMODORUS. That is quite true, Marcus; and this Son is worshipped under  the various names of Hermes, Mithra, Adonis, Apollo, and Jesus.    MARCUS. I should not be a Christian if I gave Him any other names than  those of Jesus Christ, and Saviour. He is the true Son of God. But He  is not eternal, since He had a beginning; as to thinking that He existed  before He was begotten, we must leave that absurdity to the Nicaean  mules, and the obstinate ass who too long governed the Church of  Alexandria under the accursed name of Athanasius.    At these words Paphnutius, white with horror and his face bedewed with  the sweat of agony made the sign of the cross, but maintained a sublime  silence.    Marcus continued--    \"It is clear that the foolish Nicene Creed is a treason against the  majesty of the only God, by compelling Him to share His indivisible  attributes with His own emanation--the Mediator by whom all things were  made. Cease jesting at the true God of the Christians, Nicias, and learn  that, like the lilies of the field, He toils not, neither does He spin.  It was not He who was the worker, it was His only Son, Jesus, who,  having created the world, came afterwards to repair His handiwork. For  the creation could not be perfect, and evil was necessarily mingled with  good.\"    NICIAS. What is \"good,\" and what is \"evil\"?    There was a moment's silence, during which Hermodorus, his arm extended  on the cloth, pointed to a little ass in Corinthian metal which bore two  baskets--the one containing white olives, the other black olives.    \"You see these olives,\" he said. \"The contrast between the colours is  pleasant to the eye, and we are content that these should be light  and those should be dark. But, if they were endowed with thought and  knowledge, the white would say, It is good for an olive to be white,  it is bad for it to be black; and the black olives would hate the white  olives. We judge better, for we are as much above them as the gods are  above us. For man, who only sees a part of things, evil is an evil; for  God, who understands all things, evil is a good. Doubtless ugliness is  ugly, and not beautiful; but if all were beautiful, the whole would not  be beautiful. It is, then, well that there should be evil, as the second  Plato, far greater than the first, has demonstrated.\"    EUCRITES. Let us talk more morally. Evil is an evil--not for the world,  of which it cannot destroy the indestructible harmony but for the sinner  who does it, and cannot help doing it.    COTTA. By Jupiter? that is a good argument.    EUCRITES. The world is a tragedy by an excellent poet. God, who composed  it, has intended each of us to play a part in it. If he wills that you  shall be a beggar, a prince, or a cripple, make the best of the part  assigned you.    NICIAS. Assuredly it would be well that the cripple should limp like  Hephaistos: it would be well that the madman should indulge in all the  fury of Ajax, that the incestuous woman should repeat the crimes of  Phaedra, that the traitor should betray, that the rascal should lie, and  the murderer kill, and when the piece was played, all the actor--kings,  just men, bloody tyrants, pious virgins, immodest wives, noble-minded  citizens, and cowardly assassins--should receive from the poet an equal  share in the felicitations.    EUCRITES. You distort my thought, Nicias, and change a beautiful young  girl into a hideous Gorgon. I am sorry for you, if you are so ignorant  of the nature of the gods, of justice, and of the eternal laws.    ZENOTHEMIS. For my part, friends, I believe in the reality of good and  evil. But I am convinced that there is not a single human action--were  it even the kiss of Judas--which does not bear within itself the germ of  redemption. Evil contributes to the ultimate salvation of men, and, in  that respect issues from Good, and shares the merits belonging to  Good. This has been admirably expressed by the Christians, in the myth  concerning the man with red hair, who, in order to betray his master,  gave him the kiss of peace, and by such act assured the salvation of  men. Therefore, nothing is, in my opinion, more unjust and absurd than  the hate with which certain disciples of Paul, the tentmaker, pursue  the most unfortunate of the apostles of Jesus without realising that the  kiss of Iscariot--prophesied by Jesus Himself--was necessary, according  to their own doctrine, for the redemption of men, and that if Judas  had not received the thirty pieces, the divine wisdom would have been  impugned, Providence frustrated, its designs upset, and the world given  over to evil, ignorance, and death.    MARCUS. Divine wisdom foresaw that Judas, though he was not obliged  to give the traitor's kiss, would give it, notwithstanding. It thus  employed the sin of Iscariot as a stone in the marvellous edifice of the  redemption.    ZENOTHEMIS. I spoke just now, Marcus, as though I believed that the  redemption of men had been accomplished by Jesus crucified, because I  know that such is the belief of the Christians, and I borrowed their  opinion that I might the better show the mistake of those who believe in  the eternal damnation of Judas. But, in reality, Jesus was, in my eyes,  but the precursor of Basilides and Valentinus. As to the mystery of the  redemption, I will tell you, my dear friends--if you are at all curious  to hear it--how it was really accomplished on earth.    The guests made a sign of assent. Like the Athenian virgins with the  baskets sacred to Ceres, twelve young girls, bearing on their heads  baskets filled with pomegranates and apples, entered the room with a  light step, in time to the music of an invisible flute. They placed  the baskets on the table, the flute ceased, and Zenothemis spoke as  follows--    \"When Eunoia, 'the thought of God,' had created the world, she confided  the government of the earth to the angels. But they did not preserve  the dispassion befitting masters. Seeing that the daughters of men were  fair, they surprised them in the evening by the wellside, and united  themselves to them. From these unions sprang a turbulent race, who  covered the earth with injustice and cruelty, and the dust of the roads  drank up the blood of the innocent. The sight of this caused Eunoia  infinite grief.    \"'See what I have done!' she sighed, leaning towards the world. 'My  poor children are plunged in misery, and by my fault. Their suffering  is my crime, and I will expiate it. God Himself, who only thinks through  me, would be powerless to restore them to their pristine purity. That  which is done is done, and the creation will remain for ever imperfect.  But, at least, I will not forsake my creatures. If I cannot make them  happy, like me, I can make myself unhappy, like them. Since I committed  the mistake of giving them bodies which dishonour them, I will myself  assume a body like unto theirs, and will go and live amongst them.'    \"Having thus spoken, Eunoia descended to the earth, and was incarnate  in the breast of a woman of Argos. She was born small and feeble, and  received the name of Helen. She submitted to all the labours of this  life, but soon grew in grace and beauty, and became the most desired  of women, as she had determined, in order that her mortal body might be  tried by the most supreme defilements. An inert prey to lascivious and  violent men, she suffered rape and adultery, in expiation of all the  adulteries, all the violences, all the iniquities, and caused, by her  beauty, the ruin of nations, that God might pardon the sins of the  universe. And never was the celestial thought, never was Eunoia, so  adorable as in those days when, as a woman, she prostituted herself to  heroes and shepherds. The poets surmised her divinity when they painted  her so peaceful, superb, and fatal, and when they addressed that  invocation to her, 'A soul as serene as a calm upon the waters.'    \"Thus was Eunoia led by pity into evil and suffering. She died, and the  Argives still show her tomb--for it was necessary that she should know  death after lust, and taste the bitter fruit she had sown. But, emerging  from the decomposed flesh of Helen, she became incarnate again as  a woman, and again suffered every form of insult and outrage. Thus,  passing from body to body, throughout all the evil ages, she takes upon  her the sins of the world. Her sacrifice will not be in vain. Joined to  us by the bonds of the flesh, loving us, and weeping with us, she will  effect her redemption and ours, and will carry us, clinging to her white  breast, into the peace of the regained paradise.\"    HERMODORUS. This myth was not unknown to me. I remembered having heard  that, in one of her metamorphoses, the divine Helen lived with the  magician, Simon, in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius. I thought,  however, that her perdition was involuntary, and that she was dragged  down by the angels in their fall.    ZENOTHEMIS. It is true, Hermodorus, that men who were not properly  initiated in the mysteries have imagined that the sad Eunoia was not a  party to her own downfall. But if it were as they assert Eunoia would  not be the expiating courtesan, the victim covered with stains of  all sorts, the bread steeped in the wine of our shame, the pleasant"]]]
