The discoveries are described by Montagnani as \"marble  entablatures of enormous size and beautiful workmanship, with festoons  and _bucranii_ in the frieze. No one took the trouble to sketch them;  they were destroyed on the spot. I have no doubt that they belonged to  the temple seen by Vacca on the Monte Tarpeo, one hundred and  eighty-six years ago.\"    All these indications, compared with the discovery of the platform,  the substructure, and the column of Pentelic marble in the  Conservatori garden, leave no doubt as to the real position of the  Temple of Jupiter. To that piece of marble we owe the opportunity and  the privilege of settling a dispute on Roman topography which had  lasted at least three centuries.    The temple, rebuilt by Domitian, stood uninjured till the middle of  the fifth century. In June, 455, the Vandals, under Genseric,  plundered the sanctuary, its statues were carried off to adorn the  African residence of the king, and half the roof was stripped of its  gilt bronze tiles. From that time the place was used as a stone-quarry  and lime-kiln to such an extent that only the solitary fragment of a  column remains on the spot to tell the long tale of destruction.  Another piece of Pentelic marble was found January 24, 1889, near the  Tullianum (S. Pietro in Carcere). It belongs to the top of a column,  and has the same number of flutings,--twenty-four. This fragment seems  to have been sawn on the spot to the desired length, seven feet, and  then dragged down the hill towards some stone-cutter's shop. Why it  was thus abandoned, half way, in a hollow or pit dug expressly for it,  there is nothing to show.    The Temple of Jupiter is represented in ancient monuments of the class  called pictorial reliefs. I have selected for my illustration one of  the panels from the triumphal arch of Marcus Aurelius, near S.  Martina, because it contains a good sketch of the reliefs of the  pediment, with Jupiter seated between Juno and Minerva. The temple  itself is most carelessly drawn, the number of columns being reduced  by one half, that is, from eight to four.[50]    [Illustration: PANEL FROM THE ARCH OF MARCUS AURELIUS]    There is one interesting feature of the Capitolium, which is not well  known among those who do not make a profession of archaeology. It was  used as a place for advertising State acts, deeds, and documents, in  order that the public might take notice of them and be informed of  what was going on in the administrative, military, and political  departments. This fact is known from a clause appended to imperial  letters-patent by which veterans were honorably discharged from the  army or navy, and privileges bestowed on them in recognition of their  services. These deeds, known as _diplomata honestae missionis_, were  engraved on bronze tablets shaped like the cover of a book, the  original of which was hung somewhere in the Capitolium, and a copy  taken by the veteran to his home. The originals are all gone, having  fallen the prey of the plunderers of bronze in Rome, but copies are  found in great numbers in every province of the Roman empire from  which men were drafted.[51] These copies end with the clause:--    \"Transcribed (and compared or verified) from the original bronze  tablet which is hung in Rome, in the Capitolium\"--and here follows the  designation of a special place of the Capitolium, such as,--    \"On the right side of the shrine of the _Fides populi romani_\"  (December 11, A. D. 52).    \"On the left side of the _aedes Thensarum_\" (July 2, A. D. 60).    \"On the pedestal of the statue of Quintus Marcius Rex, behind the  temple of Jupiter\" (June 15, 64).    \"On the pedestal of the _ara gentis Iuliae_, on the right side,  opposite the statue of Bacchus\" (March 7, 71).    \"On the vestibule, on the left wall, between the two archways\" (May  21, 74).    \"On the pedestal of the statue of Jupiter Africus\" (December 2, 76).    \"On the base of the column, on the inner side, near the statue of  Jupiter Africus\" (September 5, 85).    \"On the tribunal by the trophies of Germanicus, which are near the  shrine of the _Fides_\" (May 15, 86).    Comparing these indications of localities with the dates of the  diplomas,--there are sixty-three in all,--it appears that they were  not hung at random, but in regular order from monument to monument,  until every available space was covered. In the year 93 there was not  an inch left, and the Capitol is mentioned no more as a place for  exhibiting or advertising the acts of Government. From that year they  were hung \"_in muro post templum divi ad Minervam_,\" that is, behind  the modern church of S. Maria Liberatrice.      THE TEMPLE OF ISIS AND SERAPIS. In the spring of 1883, in surveying  the tract of ground between the Collegio Romano and the Baths of  Agrippa, formerly occupied by the Temple of Isis and Serapis, and in  collecting archaeological information concerning it, I was struck by  the fact that, every time excavations were made on either side of the  Via di S. Ignazio for building or restoring the houses which line it,  remarkable specimens of Egyptian art had been brought to light. The  annals of discoveries begin with 1374, when the obelisk now in the  Piazza della Rotonda was found, under the apse of the church of S.  Maria sopra Minerva, together with the one now in the Villa Mattei von  Hoffman. In 1435, Eugenius IV. discovered the two lions of Nektaneb I.  which are now in the Vatican, and the two of black basalt now in the  Capitoline Museum. In 1440 the reclining figure of a river-god was  found and buried again. The Tiber of the Louvre and the Nile of the  Braccio Nuovo seem to have come to light during the pontificate of Leo  X.; at all events it was he who caused them to be removed to the  Vatican. In 1556 Giovanni Battista de Fabi found, and sold to cardinal  Farnese, the reclining statue of Oceanus now in Naples. In 1719 the  Isiac altar now in the Capitol was found under the Biblioteca  Casanatense. In 1858 Pietro Tranquilli, in restoring his house,--the  nearest to the apse of la Minerva,--came across the following-named  objects: a sphinx of green granite, the head of which is a portrait of  Queen Haths'epu, the oldest sister of Thothmes III., who was famous  for her expedition to the Red Sea, recently described by  Duemmichen;[52] a sphinx of red granite, believed to be a Roman  replica; a group of the cow Hathor, the living symbol of Isis, nursing  the young Pharaoh Horemheb; the portrait statue of the grand dignitary  Uahabra, a good specimen of Saitic art; a column of the temple,  covered with high reliefs, which represented a procession of  bald-headed priests holding canopi in their hands; a capital, carved  with papyrus leaves and lotus flowers; and a fragment of an Egyptian  basrelief in red granite, with traces of polychromy.    In 1859 Augusto Silvestrelli, the owner of the next house, on the same  side of the Via di S. Ignazio, found five capitals of the same style  and size, which, I believe, are now in the Museo Etrusco Gregoriano.  Inasmuch as no excavation had ever been made under the pavement of the  street itself, which is public property, and as there was no reason  why that strip of public property should not contain as many works of  art as the houses about it, I asked the municipal authorities to try  the experiment, and my proposal was accepted at once.    The work began on Monday, June 11, 1883. It was difficult, because we  had to dig to a depth of twenty feet between houses of very doubtful  solidity. First to appear, at the end of the third day, was a  magnificent sphinx of black basalt, the portrait of King Amasis. It is  a masterpiece of the Saitic school, perfected even in the smallest  details, and still more impressive for its historical connection with  the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses.    [Illustration: The Sphinx of Amasis.]    The cartouches bearing the king's name appear to have been purposely  erased, though not so completely as to render the name illegible. The  nose, likewise, and the _uraeus_, the symbol of royalty, were hammered  away at the same time. The explanation of these facts is given by  Herodotos. When Cambyses conquered Sais, Amasis had just been buried.  The conqueror caused the body to be dragged out of the royal tomb,  then flogged and otherwise insulted, and finally burnt, the maximum of  profanation, from an Egyptian point of view. His name was erased from  the monuments which bore it, as a natural consequence of the _memoriae  damnatio_. This sphinx is the surviving testimonial of the eventful  catastrophe. When, six or seven centuries later, a Roman governor of  Egypt, or a Roman merchant from the same province, singled out this  work of art, to be shipped to Rome as a votive offering for the Temple  of Isis, ignorant of the historical value of its mutilations, he had  the nose and the _uraeus_ carefully restored. Now both are gone again,  and there is no danger of a second restoration. I may remark, as a  curious coincidence, that, as the name of Amasis is erased from the  sphinx, so that of Hophries, his predecessor, is erased from the  obelisk discovered in the same temple, and now in the Piazza della  Minerva. In these two monuments of the Roman Iseum we possess a  synopsis of Egyptian history between 595 and 526 B. C.    [Illustration: Obelisk of Rameses the Great.]    The second work, discovered June 17, was an obelisk which was  wonderfully well preserved to the very top of the pinnacle, and  covered with hieroglyphics. It was quarried at Assuan, from a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],[0,"The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#17)"],[1,"of Cedarville.  Sobber had given one of the cadets a note for the master of the Hall.  This ran as follows:         \"Must go to the village on a matter of great importance. Will       explain when I return.--T. Sobber.\"    \"Maybe he has gone to find out about that snake,\" suggested Tom.    \"How could he?\" came from his younger brother. \"The museum keeper has  moved away.\"    \"Tad may know where he moved to,\" put in Larry.    A whole day passed and the bully did not show himself. Then Captain  Putnam drove over to the village and attempted to hunt him up, but  without success. He learned that the museum man had shipped his outfit  to Boston.    \"He has run away,\" said the master of the Hall to Mr. Pell and George  Strong. \"I am satisfied now that he was guilty. But as Nick knew of it,  he must have had something to do with it,\" he added.    \"I trust my son recovers,\" answered Mr. Pell, with a deep sigh. But the  days went by and Nick Pell still remained in bad shape, very weak and  out of his mind for the greater part of the time. During his lucid  intervals he told how Sobber had purchased the snake for five dollars,  the owner saying it was sick and liable to die in the near future. He  added that the bully had said he hoped the snake would bite one of the  Rovers.    \"I didn't want him to use the snake,\" said the sufferer, \"but he  insisted, and told me to keep my mouth shut about it.\" After that poor  Nick began to rave again and had to be given some medicine to keep him  quiet. During one of his good spells he was removed to a house located  about half a mile from Putnam Hall, where he could get the benefit of  absolute quietness. His father went back to business, but his mother  remained behind to nurse her boy.    The Thanksgiving holidays were now at hand, but the Rover boys decided  to remain at the Hall and not go home until Christmas. Besides, they  were preparing for the party at the Stanhope cottage, which was to come  off on the following Wednesday evening. They had seen Dora, Nellie and  Grace several times, and all had prepared for \"the best time ever,\" as  the girls put it. Captain Putnam gave the boys permission to take the  carryall and allowed them to leave the school on the day of the party at  six o'clock.    \"Whoop! here we go!\" cried Tom, as he took the whip and cracked it  loudly. \"Hold on, everybody! Peleg, don't let the team lag,\" he went on,  to the driver.    \"An' don't you go for to make 'em run away, Master Tom,\" answered the  driver, grimly.    \"It's a pretty long drive and we don't want to be late,\" said Dick. \"So  push ahead as fast as you can.\"    \"Say, Tubby, where's your stovepipe hat?\" asked Sam of the dude cadet,  who formed one of the party.    \"I--ah--thought it would not be--ah--quite appropriate,\" lisped William  Philander. \"Not--ah--being full dress, you know.\"    \"He was afraid of having it mashed,\" said Fred. \"Hurrah! We're off! Now  for a good night's fun!\"    They were to have a good night's fun--and a most unusual adventure with  it.          CHAPTER XIX    WHAT HAPPENED AT THE PARTY      It was a clear, bright evening when the boys drove over to the Stanhope  cottage. All were in high spirits and sang and joked to their hearts'  content. For the time being the trouble with Tad Sobber was totally  forgotten. So far nothing more had been heard of the bully, and all were  satisfied that he had left both Putnam Hall and Cedarville and perhaps  for good.    \"One boy told me he used to live with an uncle in New York City,\" said  Larry. \"He didn't know the uncle's name.\"    When the carryall arrived at the Stanhope place they found the cottage  well lit up. Dora had invited a number of her girl friends and these,  with her cousins, Grace and Nellie, were already on hand. The boys let  out a ringing cheer as they stopped at the horse-block, and the girls  came out to greet them.    \"All here?\" cried Dora.    \"All here,\" was the answer.    \"Good!\" cried several of the girls.    \"I guess we are a bit early,\" observed Dick. \"But we wanted to make sure  we wouldn't be late, and it's a long drive over.\"    \"You are not a bit too early,\" answered Dora, and gave him her dainty  hand which he squeezed ardently.    Soon the boys were piling out on the ground, and a general handshaking  followed. Those who did not know each other were introduced, and  everybody walked into the house, where a room upstairs had been prepared  for the cadets' reception.    \"Now, everyone must feel perfectly at home,\" said Mrs. Stanhope, who was  being assisted by Mrs. Laning and Mr. Laning. The older folks prepared  the refreshments while the young people sat down in the parlor and the  sitting room.    At first, as at all parties, there was a little stiffness, but this was  soon broken by Tom asking in a solemn voice:    \"Say, did anybody bring an iceberg in his pocket? If he did he will  please set it on the kitchen stove to thaw out.\"    \"Oh, Tom!\" shrieked Nellie, and all the girls giggled. Then the \"ice was  broken\" and everybody started to talk at once. Even William Philander  was pleased, for he had discovered a tall, willowy girl who exactly  suited him and who thought him charming.    At first they played half a dozen different games and gave out riddles,  and Songbird recited a poem written in honor of the occasion. The poem  was the best effort he had yet made in the verse line and of course  everybody applauded. Then Grace said he ought to have it published in  the Cedarville weekly paper, and this pleased the poet very much.    \"Maybe you can get a dollar a line for it, Songbird,\" suggested Dick.    \"If he can we'll let him divide up with us,\" added Tom, and this caused  a laugh.    Presently refreshments were announced, and the boys and girls paired off  and entered the dining room. Here a long table was spread, decorated  with autumn leaves and the Putnam Hall colors. There were six colored  candles on the table, each with an elaborate red shade, and the general  effect was warm and pleasing. There were plenty of good things to eat,  including ice-cream frozen into all sorts of forms. When the forms were  passed around, Dick got a drum major, Tom an Uncle Sam, and Sam an  airship. Hans got a fat Dutch boy, which tickled him immensely.    \"Dot vos look chust like some poys by der Fadderlandt,\" he observed.    With the ice-cream came snapper bonbons, filled with all sorts of things  made of paper, and soon one boy was wearing an apron, another a  nightcap, and the like. Dora got a yellow jacket, and Nellie a baker's  cap, while Grace skipped around wearing a poke hat over a foot high.  There was plenty of laughter, and the old folks did not hesitate to join  in. Nuts and raisins followed the ice-cream, and then the young folks  went back to the sitting room and the parlor to finish their games and  have some music.    \"Dora, you must play for us,\" said Dick, and led her to the piano. Then,  while some of the others gathered around the girl played \"Waiting for  the Wagon,\" \"Aunt Dinah's Quilting Party,\" and a number of other  favorites, and these the crowd sang lustily.    \"Guess it is about time for us to leave,\" whispered Fred to Dick,  presently. \"I know you'll like to have Dora play all night for you, but  it can't be done.\"    Dick looked at his watch.    \"Phew! as late as this!\" he exclaimed softly. \"Yes, we'll have to go.\"    \"Let us sing 'Home, Sweet Home,'\" suggested one of the boys, and Dora  struck up the opening chords. They were in the midst of the first verse  when Dick chanced to glance towards one of the windows and stopped  short.    A man was outside peering in at the party.    [Illustration: A MAN WAS OUTSIDE PEERING IN AT THE PARTY.]    It was Merrick!    \"Well, I never!\" burst out the eldest Rover boy, and his sudden  exclamation caused Dora to look at him curiously and stop playing.    \"What is the matter, Dick?\"    \"Did you see that man at the window? He is gone now.\"    \"I didn't see anybody.\"    \"Who was it?\" asked Tom, quickly.    \"It was that rascal Merrick!\"    \"Merrick!\" ejaculated Sam. \"The fellow who took Uncle Randolph's bonds?\"    \"The same.\"    \"Oh, Dick, you must be mistaken.\"    \"I was not mistaken--I saw him as plain as day. I am going to look for  him,\" added the eldest Rover, for the man had now disappeared.    He ran for the hall door, and the other boys followed. The girls  remained in the parlor, much frightened, for it was after midnight.    As Dick reached the piazza he saw a dark form stealing along a row of  bushes near the garden fence.    \"There he is!\" he exclaimed. \"Stop!\" he called out, loudly. \"Stop, I  tell you!\"    \"Who did you say it was?\" asked John Laning, as he came from the kitchen  with a stout cane in his hand.    \"That rascal Merrick, one of the two men who stole my uncle's traction  company bonds,\" explained Dick.    \"What can he be doing here?\"    \"I don't know. There he goes, over the fence!\"    \"He is running towards the side road!\" exclaimed Sam. \"Come on after  him!\"    \"Wait till we get our hats and coats,\" said Tom, and ran back to pick up  the articles mentioned. This took a couple of minutes, and by the time  he came back Merrick was out of sight.    The three Rovers ran to the side road, Fred Garrison and Mr. Laning with  them.    \"I wish I had a pistol,\" remarked John Laning. \"No telling how desperate  a character that villain may be.\"    \"I'd like to know if he came on foot or with a horse,\" said Dick.    \"Do you think he followed us to this place?\" asked Sam.    \"I am sure I don't know. The whole thing looks mighty queer to me.\"    There was no moon, but the stars were shining brightly, so they could  see fairly well on the road. As they reached a bend Tom pointed forward.    \"There he is, just going into the bushes!\"    \"He had better not go that way,\" was Mr. Laning's remark, \"unless he  knows the ground well.\"    \"Why not?\" asked Sam.    \"Just beyond that patch of timber is Nixon's Swamp, as it is called-"]]]
