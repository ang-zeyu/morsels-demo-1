Lord Cookburn looks jealously at Fra Diavolo, though he does  not recognize in him a brigand.  The English are robbed by Diavolo's  band.  Disgusted with the insecurity of \"la bella Italia\" they reach  the inn at Terracina, where the dragoons, hearing the account of this  new robbery, believe that it was Fra Diavolo with his band, and at once  decide to pursue him.    Shortly afterwards Fra Diavolo arrives at the inn, disguised as the  Marquis of San Marco, under which name the English lord has already  made his acquaintance.  He is not enchanted by the arrival of this  Marquis; he fears a new flirtation {92} with his own fair wife.  Pamella wears most valuable diamonds, and these strike the eye of Fra  Diavolo.    He sees that the English have been clever enough to conceal the greater  part of their wealth and resolves to put himself speedily into  possession of it.    He is flirting desperately with Pamella and looking tenderly at the  pretty Zerline, when the soldiers return, having captured twenty of the  brigands and retaken the greater part of Lord Cookburn's money and  jewels.  Lorenzo, the captain of dragoons is rewarded by the  magnanimous Lord with 10,000 Lire, and may now hope to win Zerline's  hand.  But Fra Diavolo vows to avenge the death of his comrades on  Lorenzo.    In the second act he conceals himself behind the curtains in Zerline's  sleeping-room, and during the night he admits his two companions Beppo  and Giacomo.  Zerline enters and is about to retire to rest, after  praying to the Holy Virgin for protection.--During her sleep Giacomo is  to stab her, while the two others are to rob the English Milord.    But Zerline's prayer, and her innocence touch even the robbers, the  deed is delayed, and this delay brings Lorenzo upon them.  Fra  Diavolo's two companions hide themselves, and the false Marquis alone  is found in Zerline's room.  He assures Lorenzo, that he had a  rendez-vous with his bride, and at the same time whispers into Milord's  ear, that he came by appointment with Milady, showing {93} her  portrait, of which he had robbed her the day before, as proof.  The  consequence of these lies is a challenge from Lorenzo, and a meeting  with Diavolo is fixed.  The latter is full of triumphant glee; he has  arranged a deep-laid plan with the surviving members of his band and  hopes to ensnare not only Lorenzo but his whole company.  Ordinarily  Diavolo is a noble brigand; he never troubles women, and he loads poor  people with gifts, taking the gold out of rich men's purses only, but  now he is full of ire and his one thought is of vengeance.    Finally he is betrayed by the carelessness of his own helpmates.  Beppo  and Giacomo, seeing Zerline, recognize in her their fair prey of the  evening before and betray themselves by repeating some of the words  which she had given utterance to.  Zerline, hearing them, is now able  to comprehend the wicked plot, which was woven to destroy her  happiness.  The two banditta are captured and compelled to lure their  captain into a trap.  Diavolo appears, not in his disguise as a  Marquis, but in his own well-known dress, with the red plume waving  from his bonnet, and being assured by Beppo, that all is secure, is  easily captured.  Now all the false imputations are cleared up.  Milord  is reconciled to his wife and Lorenzo obtains the hand of the lovely  Zerline.          {94}    FRAUENLOB.    Opera in three acts by REINHOLD BECKER.    Text by FRANZ KOPPEL-ELLFELD.      Becker, the well-known Dresden composer, has long won name and fame by  his beautiful songs, which may be heard all over the continent.  He is  a first-rate \"Liedermeister\", and great was the excitement, with which  his friends looked forward to his first opera.    Their expectations were not deceived, for the opera was put on the  stage in Dresden on Dec. 8th 1892, and was received with unanimous  applause.    Becker is not one of those high-flown artists who elevate us to the  skies; he rather lacks dramatic strength; the lyric element is his  strong point.  By the Lied he finds his way direct to the hearts of his  hearers, and where ever this could be woven into the action of his  opera, he has done it with subtle taste.  Tilda's dancing-air in the  first act, the evening-song, sung while the people are gliding down the  Rhine in boats, whose lovely variations remind us of quaint old airs of  bye-gone days,--the chorus of the stone-masons in the second act, and  the love-duet in the third are brilliant gems in Becker's music.    The libretto rivals the best of its kind.    The scene is laid near and in Maintz in the year 1308; it takes place  during the reign of Ludwig, Emperor of Bavaria.    Heinrich Frauenlob, the famous minstrel, who had won his name by his  songs in women's praise, {95} is by birth a knight, Dietherr zur Meise.  Years ago he slew the Truchsess of Maintz in self-defence, and having  therefore become an outlaw, had entered the service of the Emperor.  In  the beginning of the opera we find him however near Maintz, where he  stays as a guest at his friend's Wolf's castle.  He takes part in the  people's festival on Midsummer day, deeming himself unknown.    When the customary St. John's fire is lighted, no one dares leap over  it for fear of an old gipsy's prophesy, which threatened with sudden  death the first who should attempt it.  Frauenlob, disregarding the  prophesy, persuades Hildegund, Ottker von Scharfenstein's fair ward, to  venture through the fire with him.  Hildegund is the slain Truchsess'  daughter, and has sworn, to wed the avenger of her father's death, but  each lover is unconscious of the other's name.  The gipsy Sizyga alone,  who had been betrayed in her youth by Frauenlob's father, recognizes  the young knight, and though he has only just saved the old hag from  the people's fury, she wishes to avenge her wrongs on him.  To this end  she betrays the secret of Frauenlob's birth to Hildegund's suitor,  Servazio di Bologna, who is highly jealous of this new rival, and  determines to lay hands on him, as soon as he enters the gates of  Maintz.--Frauenlob, though warned by Sizyga, enters Maintz attracted by  Hildegund's sweet graces; he is determined to confess everything, and  then to fly with her, should she be willing to follow him.    {96}    The second act opens with a fine song of the warder of the tower.  The  city awakes, the stonemasons assemble, ready to greet the Emperor,  whose arrival is expected.  Tilda, Hildegund's friend, and daughter to  Klas, chief of the stone-masons is going to church, but on her way she  is accosted by the knight Wolf, who has lost his heart to her, and now,  forgetting his plan to look for Frauenlob, follows the lovely  damsel.--When Frauenlob comes up, and sees again the well-known places  of his youth, he is deeply touched, but seeing his lady love step on  the balcony and soon after come down to enter the dome, he waylays her,  imploring her, to fly with him.  At this moment Servazio, who has lain  in wait, steps forth with officers, who capture Frauenlob.  Servazio  now reveals the singer's secret and Hildegund hears that her lover is  her father's murderer.  Though Frauenlob tells Hildegund, that he  killed her father in self-defence, she turns from him shuddering.  Feeling that all hopes of his future happiness are at an end, he wishes  to atone for his deed by death, refusing the help of Wolf, who comes up  with his men, to release him.  But the stone-masons, having recognized  the celebrated minstrel, with whose song they are about to greet the  Emperor, decide to invoke the latter's clemency.    In the third act the citizens of Maintz hail the Emperor, after which  Frauenlob's cause is brought before him.  The whole population demands  his pardon, and the monarch, who loves the singer, {97} would fain  liberate him, had not Servazio roughly insisted on the culprit's  punishment.  Uncertain, what to do, the Emperor receives a long  procession of ladies with Tilda at its head, who all beseech pardon for  Frauenlob.  At last the Emperor calls for Hildegund, leaving in her  hands the destiny of the prisoner.  Left alone with him the latter,  prepared to die, only craves her pardon.  After a hard struggle with  her conscience, love conquers and she grants him pardon.  When the  Emperor reenters with his suite, to hear the sentence, they find the  lovers in close embrace.  To the joy of everybody the Monarch sanctions  the union and orders the nuptials to be celebrated at once.  Another  pair, Wolf and Tilda are also made happy.  But Servazio vows vengeance.  Sizyga, having secretly slipped a powder into his hands, he pours it  into a cup of wine, which he presents to Frauenlob as a drink of  reconciliation.  The Emperor handing the goblet to Hildegund, bids her  drink to her lover.  Testing it, she at once feels its deadly effect.  Frauenlob, seeing his love stagger, snatches the cup from her emptying  it at one draught.  He dies, still praising the Emperor and women,  breathing the name of his bride with his last breath.  Servazio is  captured, and while Hildegund's body is strewn with roses, the wailing  women of Maintz carry their beloved minstrel to his grave.--          {98}    DER FREISCHUeTZ.    Romantic Opera in three acts by C. M. VON WEBER.    Text by FRIEDRICH KIND.      This charming opera done at Dresden 1820, is the most favored of  Weber's compositions.  It is truly German, being both fantastic and  poetic.  The libretto is an old German legend and runs thus:    A young huntsman, Max, is in love with Agathe,' daughter of Cuno, the  chief-ranger of Prince Ottocar of Bohemia.  Max woos her, but their  union depends on a master-shot, which he is to deliver on the following  morning.    During a village-festival he has all day been unlucky in shooting, and  we see him full of anger and sorrow, being mocked at by peasants, more"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24652"],[0,"Diversions in Sicily (#17)"],[1,"the Greeks, migrated to Sicily, settled in the  neighbourhood of the Sicans and were all together called Elymi, their  cities being Eryx and Segesta.  The city walls were originally built by  the Sicans, and restored by the Phoenicians when they came to the  mountain; on many of the stones the quarrymen's marks in Phoenician  characters are still visible.    It was believed that at certain seasons of the year the goddess left her  shrine on the mountain and went over into Africa accompanied by all the  pigeons of the neighbourhood, and this was the occasion for a festival of  Anagogia. {151}  A little later, when the pigeons returned, the goddess  was believed to come back with them, and then there was another festival  of Catagogia. {151}  Seeing that she would have had to go little more  than 120 miles in order to reach what is now Cape Bon, and then only to  cross the gulf of Tunis to arrive at the Phoenician colony of Carthage,  one may suppose it probable that these flittings began when Astarte was  in power.    In our own time the Madonna di Custonaci reigns upon the Mountain, and is  Protectress of the whole comune.  Her sacred picture is normally in her  sanctuary down at Custonaci, about 15 kilometres distant, but when any  general calamity afflicts the district, it is brought up to the Matrice  or Mother Church of the comune on Mount Eryx.  On these occasions three  days of humiliation are proclaimed, priests and men, their heads crowned  with thorns, their necks encircled with cords, go about the town  flagellating themselves; in the evening fires are lighted in the balio,  and all the villages below answer by lighting fires too, to show that  they are taking part in the general tribulation.  A document is signed by  the sindaco, and then the picture is brought from Custonaci and set over  the great altar in the church of the Matrice.  When it has become quite  clear that the anger of Heaven has been appeased, the picture is taken  back to Custonaci.    The calamity that most commonly befalls the comune is a drought, or the  fear of a drought.  Rain is not wanted while the salt is being made, but  as soon as that is all under cover in the autumn it is time for the rain  to begin, otherwise the crops will fail.  In 1893 the rain was delayed  until matters began to look so serious that it was determined to bring  the picture up to the mountain.  The proper formalities having been  observed, the people all went out in crowds to welcome it and, as it was  borne along, cried--    \"Acqua, Maria, acqua!\"  (\"Rain, Maria, rain!\")    Meanwhile the clouds were gathering and presently a tremendous  thunderstorm came on which drenched them all, and they returned to the  mountain, shouting--    \"Basta, Maria, basta!\"  (\"Leave off, Maria, leave off!\")    The lightning struck the church and injured four persons who were  standing near the altar, but the Madonna was already in her place, and  owing to her presence they recovered.    The picture, like many of the thaumaturgic representations of the  Madonna, is the work of St. Luke the Evangelist--all except the head  which was done by an angel who descended from heaven expressly for the  purpose.  This being so, one would expect to find its home on the top of  the very Mountain itself, in the chief place of the comune, and not down  at an insignificant little village like Custonaci.  Some have thought  that to allow the Sanctuary of a Madonna Ericina to take the place of the  Temple of Venus Erycina would have been to insist on a parallelism about  which it was desirable to say as little as possible.  Others believe the  real reason why we have a Madonna di Custonaci to be preserved in the  following legend. {154}    A French vessel, laden with precious merchandise and also with this still  more precious picture, was returning to Marseilles from Alexandria in  Egypt, and, while sailing the Sicilian seas, encountered a furious  tempest.  The more the unhappy mariners laboured to govern their craft,  the less they succeeded, and at last, despairing of earthly help, they  turned their thoughts to the Madonna.  With streaming eyes they knelt  before the painting and prayed without ceasing to the Queen of Heaven  that she would be graciously pleased to conduct them safely home.  For a  long time they met with no response, but when they were nearing Cofano,  every sailor heard a voice, as though coming from the picture and  declaring that the Madonna desired to be landed on the neighbouring  coast.  Whereupon they bound themselves by a vow that if they reached  land in safety they would build a sanctuary then and there in memory of  their miraculous preservation.  No sooner was the vow uttered than the  wind fell, the storm ceased and the surface of the waters became as  smooth as polished glass, over which the fortunate bark glided without  guidance into harbour--and this to the great astonishment of the crew who  observed that her course lay among dangerous shoals and sunken rocks.    The joyful mariners returned thanks to their Blessed Protectress and  immediately began to perform their vow; but while disembarking, they  found themselves surrounded by a crowd of armed peasants who, taking them  for Turkish pirates, ran to the spot with the intention of frustrating  their supposed nefarious designs.  Mutual explanations averted bloodshed,  and the peasants then began to dissuade the sailors from performing their  vow in so literal a manner, pointing out that they would be abandoning  their precious charge to the risk, if not the certainty, of sacrilegious  theft at the hands of the corsairs who frequented that harbour.  In the  end the simple mariners yielded to the arguments of the peasants, and  with many tears consigned the picture to their care.  The peasants put it  into a cart harnessed with two oxen who started to draw it inland, but  would only go in a direction chosen by themselves and, after proceeding  two or three kilometres, lay down and by no means could be persuaded to  go a step further.  This was accepted as an indication of the Madonna's  approval of what had been done and of her desire that her church should  be erected there, and on that spot now stands the Sanctuary of Custonaci.  The poor sailors, grieving bitterly for the loss of their treasure,  returned to the ship and continued their interrupted voyage till they  reached Marseilles in safety.    Owing to the culpable negligence of those who ought to have considered it  a privilege to be permitted to chronicle the many important miracles  which the Madonna performed in honour of the arrival of her picture, we  have particulars of only two cures wrought in those times, one on a  cripple and the other on a mute.  Any one, however, who is disposed to  doubt that there were many more has only to visit the sanctuary and take  note of the large number of votive pictures there exhibited.  Besides,  how else could the fame of this wonder-working image have travelled  abroad so extensively unless the wonders had been not less numerous than  undoubted?    There is uncertainty as to the exact date of the arrival of the picture  at the Sanctuary: some give the year 1570; others consider this too late,  if only because wills exist dated as far back as 1422 bequeathing gifts  to Santa Maria di Custonaci; others say that this need not have anything  to do with our Madonna, because there has been a church or chapel at  Custonaci dedicated to the Virgin from very early times, and there is  nothing to show that these wills do not refer to the earlier Madonna;  others believe 1370, not 1570, to be the true date.  We should have  something to guide us if we could ascertain how often the picture has  been transported to the mountain in times of calamity, but here again the  culpable negligence of the chroniclers has left us with records of only  fifty-one such occasions from the beginning of the 16th century to 1794,  viz. five when the pestilence walked by midday, four when the mountains  trembled and the earth opened, two when the locusts came without number  and devoured the fruits of the ground, four when war clouds gathered in  the sky and thirty-six when the autumn rains were delayed.    The disputes extend also to the date of the painting, some even denying  that it was painted by St. Luke.  But to do this they are obliged to  ignore all the considerations which support the orthodox view, viz. the  place from which the sailors brought it, the many wonders performed by  it, the miraculous preservation of the colouring during all the years  that have elapsed since St. Luke's time, the widespread belief in the  efficacy of its powers and lastly the fact that, though many have made  the attempt, no artist has yet succeeded in producing a perfect copy of  the original.    I asked several people what St. Luke had to do with Alexandria, and was  always told that St. Mark's body was brought from there to Venice in 828,  why then should not another of the Evangelists have been there also?  Why  not indeed?  But this reply was as little satisfying as those with which  pre-occupied age endeavours to silence inquisitive childhood, and  produced much the same sort of result, spurring me on to further  investigations.    A musician who desires to compose a tune that shall become popular must  contrive something apparently original and yet not so original as to  demand study; it must also contain echoes of other tunes previously  popular, and yet they must be so indefinite that no one can tell for  certain where they come from, which is what we mean when we say it is a  wise tune that knows its own father.  Similarly, the framers of the  foregoing legend had to compose an entirely Christian story, as original  as was compatible with the use of the forms of Christian legend, and yet  they could not neglect all the pagan traditions with which their public  had been impregnated for generations.
