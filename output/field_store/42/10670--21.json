This is a curious  fact in relation to the mosquitoes--of two persons sleeping in the same  apartment, one will sometimes be bitten or rather punctured, and half  bled to death, while the other remains untouched!  Is it the quality of  the blood or the thickness of the skin that guides to this preference?    This point was discussed amongst us--the doctor taking the view that it  was always a sign of good blood when one was more than usually subject  to the attack of mosquitoes.  He was himself an apt illustration of the  fact.  This statement of course produced a general laugh, and some  remarks at the doctor's expense, on the part of the opponents of his  theory.  Strange to say, old Ike was fiercely assailed by the little  blood-suckers.  This seemed to be an argument against the doctor's  theory, for in the tough skinny carcass of the old trapper, the blood  could neither have been very plenteous nor delicate.    Most of us smoked as we rode along, hoping by that means to drive off  the ferocious swarm, but although tobacco smoke is disagreeable to the  mosquitoes, they cannot be wholly got rid of by a pipe or cigar.  Could  one keep a constant _nimbus_ of the smoke around his face it might be  effective, but not otherwise.  A sufficient quantity of tobacco smoke  will kill mosquitoes outright, as I have more than once proved by a  thorough fumigation of my sleeping apartment.    These insects are not peculiar, as sometimes supposed, to the  inter-tropical regions of America.  They are found in great numbers even  to the shores of the Arctic Sea, and as fierce and bloodthirsty as  anywhere else--of course only in the summer season, when, as before  remarked, the thermometer in these Northern latitudes mounts to a high  figure.  Their haunts are the banks of rivers, and particularly those of  a stagnant and muddy character.    There is another singular fact in regard to them.  Upon the banks of  some of the South-American rivers, life is almost unendurable on account  of this pest--the \"_plaga de mosquitos_,\" as the Spaniards term it--  while upon other streams in the very same latitude musquitoes are  unknown.  These streams are what are termed \"_rios negros_,\" or  black-water rivers--a peculiar class of rivers, to which many  tributaries of the Amazon and Orinoco belong.    Our English comrade, who had travelled all over South America, gave us  this information as we rode along.  He stated, that he had often  considered it a great relief, a sort of escape from purgatory, while on  his travels he parted from one of the yellow or white water streams, to  enter one of the \"_rios negros_.\"  Many Indian tribes settled upon the  banks of the latter solely to get clear of the \"_plaga de mosquitos_.\"  The Indians who reside in the mosquito districts habitually paint their  bodies, and smear themselves with oil, as a protection against their  bites; and it is a common thing among the natives, when speaking of any  place, to inquire into the \"character\" of its mosquitoes!    On some tributaries of the Amazon the mosquitoes are really a life  torment, and the wretched creatures who inhabit such places frequently  bury their bodies in the sand in order to get sleep!  Even the pigments  with which they anoint themselves are pierced by the poisoned bills of  their tormentors.    Besancon and the Kentuckian both denied that any species of ointment  would serve as a protection against mosquitoes.  The doctor joined them  in their denial.  They asserted that they had tried everything that  could be thought of--camphor, ether, hartshorn, spirits of turpentine,  etcetera.    Some of us were of a different opinion, and Ike settled the point soon  after in favour of the dissentients by a practical illustration.  The  old trapper, as before stated, was a victim to the fiercest attacks, as  was manifested by the slapping which he repeatedly administered to his  cheeks, and an almost constant muttering of bitter imprecations.  He  knew a remedy he said in a \"sartint weed,\" if he could only \"lay his  claws upon it.\"  We noticed that from time to time as he rode along his  eyes swept the ground in every direction.  At length a joyous  exclamation told that he had discovered the \"weed.\"    \"Thur's the darned thing at last,\" muttered he, as he flung himself to  the ground, and commenced gathering the stalks of a small herb that grew  plentifully about.  It was an annual, with leaves very much of the size  and shape of young garden box-wood, but of a much brighter green.  Of  course we all knew well enough what it was, for there is not a village  \"common\" in the Western United States that is not covered with it.  It  was the well-known \"penny-royal\" (_Hedcoma pulegioides_), not the  English herb of that name, which is a species of _mentha_.    Redwood also leaped from his horse, and set to plucking the \"weed.\"  He  too, from experience, knew its virtues.    We all drew bridle, watching the guides.  Both operated in a similar  manner.  Having collected a handful of the tenderest tops, they rubbed  them violently between their palms--rough and good for such service--and  then passed the latter over the exposed skin of their necks and laces.  Ike took two small bunches of the stalks, crushed them under his heel,  and then stuck them beneath his cap, so that the ends hung down over his  cheeks.  This being done, he and his comrade mounted their horses and  rode on.    Some of us--the hunter-naturalist, the Englishman, and myself--  dismounted and imitated Ike--of course under a volley of laughter and  \"pooh-poohs\" from Besancon, the Kentuckian, and the doctor; but we had  not ridden two hundred paces until the joke changed sides.  From that  moment not a mosquito approached us, while our three friends were bitten  as badly as ever.    In the end they were convinced, and the torment of the mosquitoes  proving stronger than the fear of our ridicule, all three sprang out of  their saddles, and made a rush at the next bed of penny-royal that came  in sight.    Whether it is the highly aromatic odour of the penny-royal that keeps  off these insects, or whether the juice when touched by them burns the  delicate nerves of their feet I am unable to say.  Certain it is they  will not alight upon the skin which has been plentifully anointed with  it.  I have tried the same experiment often since that time with a  similar result, and in fact have never since travelled through a  mosquito country without a provision of the \"essence of penny-royal.\"  This is better than the herb itself, and can be obtained from any  apothecary.  A single drop or two spilled in the palm of the hand is  sufficient to rub over all the parts exposed, and will often ensure  sleep, where otherwise such a thing would be impossible.  I have often  lain with my face so smeared, and listened to the sharp hum of the  mosquito as it approached, fancying that the next moment I should feel  its tiny touch, as it settled down upon my cheek, or brow.  As soon,  however, as it came within the influence of the penny-royal I could hear  it suddenly tack round and wing its way off again, until its  disagreeable \"music\" was no longer heard.    The only drawback in the use of the penny-royal lies in the burning  sensation which the fluid produces upon the skin; and this in a climate  where the thermometer is pointing to 90 degrees is no slight  disqualification of the remedy.  The use of it is sometimes little  better than \"Hobbson's choice.\"    The application of it on the occasion mentioned restored the spirits of  our party, which had been somewhat kept under by the continuous attacks  of the mosquitoes, and a lively little incident that occurred soon  after, viz. the hunt and capture of a raccoon, made us all quite merry.    Cooney, though a night prowler, is sometimes abroad during the day, but  especially in situations where the timber is high, and the woods dark  and gloomy.  On the march we had come so suddenly upon this one, that he  had not time to strike out for his own tree, where he would soon have  hidden from us in its deep cavity.  He had been too busy with his own  affairs--the nest of a wild turkey upon the ground, under some brush and  leaves, the broken eggs in which told of the delicious meal he had made.  Taken by surprise--for the guides had ridden nearly on top of him--he  galloped up the nearest tree, which fortunately contained neither fork  nor cavity in which he could shelter himself; and a well-directed shot  from Redwood's rifle brought him with a heavy \"thump\" back to the ground  again.    We were all stirred up a little by this incident; in fact, the unusual  absence of game rendered ever so trifling an occurrence an \"event\" with  us.  No one, however, was so pleased as the black waggoner Jake, whose  eyes fairly danced in his head at the sight of a \"coon.\"  The \"coon\" to  Jake was well-known game--natural and legitimate--and Jake preferred  \"roast coon\" to fried bacon at any time.  Jake knew that none of us  would care to eat of his coonship.  He was therefore sure of his supper;  and the \"varmint\" was carefully deposited in the corner of the waggon.    Jake did not have it all to himself.  The trappers liked fresh meat too,  even \"coon-meat;\" and of course claimed their share.  None of the rest  of the party had any relish for such a fox-like carcass.    After supper, cooney was honoured with a description, and for many of  the facts of his history we are indebted to Jake himself.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    THE 'COON, AND HIS HABITS.    Foremost of all the wild creatures of America in point of being  generally known is the raccoon (_Procyon lotor_).

My most earnest  desire was to impart to others the knowledge that I had of the  truths of the gospel.    When I began to speak I felt an electric thrill through my whole  system. I hardly knew what I said, but the people said I spoke  from inspiration; none of the audience noticed my mistakes in  quoting Scripture.    After dinner my companion, Stewart, proposed to travel on, and, I  agreeing with him, we left the town, although the people wished  us to stay and preach again. I had but little confidence in  myself, and concluded to preach but seldom, until I got over my  timidity or man-fearing feeling that most beginners are subject  to. But I have now been a public speaker for thirty-five years,  and I have not yet entirely gotten over that feeling.    We started for Cincinnati, and traveled two days and a half  without food. My boots hurt my feet and our progress was quite  slow. The third night we applied to a tavern keeper for lodging  and food. He said we were welcome to stay in his house free, but  he must have pay for what we eat.    We sat in the hall all night, for we were much reduced by hunger  and fatigue. That was a miserable night indeed. I reflected the  matter over and over again, scrutinized it up one side and down  the other. I could not see why a servant of God should receive  such treatment - that if I was in the right faith, doing the will  of God, He would open up the way before me, and not allow me to  perish under the sore trials then surrounding me. I had seriously  considered the propriety of walking back to where the kind  landlady gave us our last meal, but was soon comforted, for these  words came into my mind:    \"He that putteth his hands to the plow, and then looketh back, is  not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven;\" \"If ye were of the world,  then the world would love its own, but because I have chosen you  out of the world, the world persecuteth you;\" \"Ye, and all who  live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution, while evil  men and seducers wax worse and worse, deceiving and being  deceived.\"    The Son of God Himself, when He entered upon the duties of His  mission, was led into the wilderness, where He was tempted forty  days and nights, and when He was hungry and asked for bread He was  told, substantially, that if His mission was of God that God would  feed Him, that if hungry He could turn the stones to bread and eat.  I remembered that similar sayings had been thrown into our teeth.  These thoughts passed through my frame like electricity - or to use  the language of one of the old prophets, it was like fire shut up in  my bones; I felt renewed and refreshed from head to foot, and  determined to trust in the Arm that could not be broken; to conquer  and subdue the passions of my nature, and by the help of God to try  and bring them in subjection to the will of the Spirit, and not of  the flesh, which is carnal, sensual, and devilish. I determined that  there should be no lack on my part.    Daylight came at last, and we renewed our journey. I put a double  guard over those evil passions that were sown thickly in my  sinful nature. The passion most dreaded by me was the lust of the  flesh; that I knew to be the worst enemy to my salvation, and I  determined to master it, I have walked along in silence for  hours, with my heart lifted up to God in prayer, pleading with  Him to give me power over my passions and sinful desires, that I  might conquer and drive from my mind those besetting sins that  were continually warring with the Spirit, which, if cherished or  suffered to remain, would wound and grieve the Spirit and drive  it away. It is written, \"My Spirit will not dwell in an unholy  temple.\" Jesus said to His followers that their bodies were the  temples of the Living God; that if they who had charge of those  temples, or bodies, allowed them to become unholy, He would  destroy that body; while to those who guarded their temples, and  kept them pure and holy, He and His Father would come and take up  their abode and dwell with them as a constant companion forever,  even unto the end, guiding them in all truth and showing them  things past, present, and to come. From day to day I kept my mind  in a constant strain upon this subject. Notwithstanding, the  tempter was ever on the alert, and contested every inch of ground  with me.    Often, while I was in the most solemn reflections, the tempter  would place before me some lovely female, possessing all the  allurements of her sex, to draw my mind from the contemplation of  holy things. For a moment humanity would claim the victory; but  quick as thought I would banish the vision from my mind and plead  with God for strength and power to resist the temptations that  were besetting me and enable me to cast aside the love of sinful  pleasures. The words of the Apostle Paul were appropriate for me  at that and in future time, when he declared that he died daily  to crucify the deeds of the flesh. So it was with me. I was  convinced that I could not serve two masters, God and Mammon.  When I tried to please the one I was certain to displease the  other. I found that I must give myself up wholly to God and His  ministry and conduct myself as a man of God, if I would be worthy  of the name of a messenger of salvation. I must have the Spirit  of God accompany my words and carry conviction to the honest in  heart. In this way I grew in grace from day to day, and I have  never seen the hour that I regretted taking up my cross and  giving up all other things to follow and obey Christ, my Redeemer  and Friend. I do most sincerely regret that I ever suffered  myself to be captivated by the wiles of the devil, contrary to my  better judgment.    Brigham teaches that the will and acts of the people must all be  dictated by him, and delights in hearing the apostles and elders  declare to the people that he, Brigham, is God. He claims that  the people are answerable to him as to their God, that they must  obey his every beck and call. It matters not what he commands or  requests the people to do, it is their duty to hear and obey. To  disobey the will of Brigham is a sin against the Holy Ghost, and  an unpardonable sin to be wiped out only by blood atonement. I  must now resume my narrative, but I will hereafter speak of  Brigham more at length.    We left the Fasting Hotel, as I called it, and traveled to  Hamilton, Ohio, then a neat little town. As we arrived in the  center of the town I felt impressed to call at a restaurant, kept  by a foreigner. It was then noon. This was the first house we had  called at since morning.    As we entered the proprietor requested us to unstrap our valises  and sit down and rest, saying we looked very tired. He asked  where we were from, and where we were going. We answered all his  questions. He then offered us refreshments; we informed him that  we had no money, and had eaten nothing for three days. He said it  made no difference to him; that if we had no money we were more  welcome than if we had plenty of it. We ate a hearty meal, and he  gave us a drink of cider. He then filled our knapsacks with buns,  cheese, sausages, and other things, after which he bid us  godspeed.    We traveled on with hearts full of gratitude to God, the  bountiful Giver Who had opened the heart of the stranger that had  just supplied our wants, and we felt grateful to and blessed the  man for his generous actions. While passing through Cincinnati we  were offered refreshments by a lady that kept an inn. We crossed  the Ohio River at Cincinnati, and stopped over night at a hotel  on the Kentucky side of the river. We then traveled through  Kentucky and into Overton and Jackson counties, Tennessee. I now  bear testimony, though many years have passed since then, that  from the moment I renewed my covenant to deny myself to all  unrighteousness and live the life of a man devoted to God's work  on earth, I have never felt that I was alone, or without a Friend  powerful to aid, direct, and shield me at all times and during  all troubles.    While in Tennessee I stopped with my friend Levi Stewart at the  houses of his relatives in Overton and Jackson counties, and  preached several times. My friend Stewart was blessed with a  large bump of self-esteem. He imagined that he could convert all  of his relatives at once; that all he had to do was to present  the gospel, and they would gladly embrace it. He appeared to  forget that a prophet was not without honor, save in his own  country and among his own kinfolk.    Brother Stewart, though I was his superior in the Priesthood, if  not in experience and ability, looked upon me as a cipher, fit  for nothing. The rough treatment and slights that I received from  him were more than humiliating to a man of fine feelings and a  spirit such as I possessed. I said nothing to him, but I poured  out my soul in secret prayer to my Heavenly Father, asking Him to  open the door for my deliverance, so that my proud spirit, which  was bound down, might soar in a free element.    One Sunday we attended a Baptist meeting. We sat facing the  preacher, but at the far side of the house. My mind was absorbed  in meditating upon my future labors. Gradually I lost consciousness  of my surroundings, and my whole being seemed in another  locality. I was in a trance, and saw future events. What I then  saw was to me a reality, and I will describe it as such. I  traveled in a strange land and among a people that I had never  seen. I was kindly received by the people, and all my wants were  supplied without my having to ask for charity. I traveled on,  going over a mountainous country. I crossed a clear, handsome  river, and was kindly received by the family of the owner of the  ferry at that river. I stayed with this family for some days. I  then recrossed the river and called at a house, where I asked for  a drink of water, which was given me. I held quite a"]]]
