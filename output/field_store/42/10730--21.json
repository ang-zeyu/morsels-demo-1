And in any case, counting gives us what mathematicians  call the _ordinal_ number of our terms; that is to say, it arranges  our terms in an order or series, and its result tells us what type of  series results from this arrangement. In other words, it is impossible  to count things without counting some first and others afterwards, so  that counting always has to do with order. Now when there are only a  finite number of terms, we can count them in any order we like; but  when there are an infinite number, what corresponds to counting will  give us quite different results according to the way in which we carry  out the operation. Thus the ordinal number, which results from what,  in a general sense may be called counting, depends not only upon how  many terms we have, but also (where the number of terms is infinite)  upon the way in which the terms are arranged.    The fundamental infinite numbers are not ordinal, but are what is  called _cardinal_. They are not obtained by putting our terms in order  and counting them, but by a different method, which tells us, to begin  with, whether two collections have the same number of terms, or, if  not, which is the greater.[14] It does not tell us, in the way in  which counting does, _what_ number of terms a collection has; but if  we define a number as the number of terms in such and such a  collection, then this method enables us to discover whether some other  collection that may be mentioned has more or fewer terms. An  illustration will show how this is done. If there existed some country  in which, for one reason or another, it was impossible to take a  census, but in which it was known that every man had a wife and every  woman a husband, then (provided polygamy was not a national  institution) we should know, without counting, that there were exactly  as many men as there were women in that country, neither more nor  less. This method can be applied generally. If there is some relation  which, like marriage, connects the things in one collection each with  one of the things in another collection, and vice versa, then the two  collections have the same number of terms. This was the way in which  we found that there are as many even numbers as there are numbers.  Every number can be doubled, and every even number can be halved, and  each process gives just one number corresponding to the one that is  doubled or halved. And in this way we can find any number of  collections each of which has just as many terms as there are finite  numbers. If every term of a collection can be hooked on to a number,  and all the finite numbers are used once, and only once, in the  process, then our collection must have just as many terms as there are  finite numbers. This is the general method by which the numbers of  infinite collections are defined.    But it must not be supposed that all infinite numbers are equal. On  the contrary, there are infinitely more infinite numbers than finite  ones. There are more ways of arranging the finite numbers in different  types of series than there are finite numbers. There are probably more  points in space and more moments in time than there are finite  numbers. There are exactly as many fractions as whole numbers,  although there are an infinite number of fractions between any two  whole numbers. But there are more irrational numbers than there are  whole numbers or fractions. There are probably exactly as many points  in space as there are irrational numbers, and exactly as many points  on a line a millionth of an inch long as in the whole of infinite  space. There is a greatest of all infinite numbers, which is the  number of things altogether, of every sort and kind. It is obvious  that there cannot be a greater number than this, because, if  everything has been taken, there is nothing left to add. Cantor has a  proof that there is no greatest number, and if this proof were valid,  the contradictions of infinity would reappear in a sublimated form.  But in this one point, the master has been guilty of a very subtle  fallacy, which I hope to explain in some future work.[15]    We can now understand why Zeno believed that Achilles cannot overtake  the tortoise and why as a matter of fact he can overtake it. We shall  see that all the people who disagreed with Zeno had no right to do so,  because they all accepted premises from which his conclusion followed.  The argument is this: Let Achilles and the tortoise start along a road  at the same time, the tortoise (as is only fair) being allowed a  handicap. Let Achilles go twice as fast as the tortoise, or ten times  or a hundred times as fast. Then he will never reach the tortoise. For  at every moment the tortoise is somewhere and Achilles is somewhere;  and neither is ever twice in the same place while the race is going  on. Thus the tortoise goes to just as many places as Achilles does,  because each is in one place at one moment, and in another at any  other moment. But if Achilles were to catch up with the tortoise, the  places where the tortoise would have been would be only part of the  places where Achilles would have been. Here, we must suppose, Zeno  appealed to the maxim that the whole has more terms than the part.[16]  Thus if Achilles were to overtake the tortoise, he would have been in  more places than the tortoise; but we saw that he must, in any period,  be in exactly as many places as the tortoise. Hence we infer that he  can never catch the tortoise. This argument is strictly correct, if we  allow the axiom that the whole has more terms than the part. As the  conclusion is absurd, the axiom must be rejected, and then all goes  well. But there is no good word to be said for the philosophers of the  past two thousand years and more, who have all allowed the axiom and  denied the conclusion.    The retention of this axiom leads to absolute contradictions, while  its rejection leads only to oddities. Some of these oddities, it must  be confessed, are very odd. One of them, which I call the paradox of  Tristram Shandy, is the converse of the Achilles, and shows that the  tortoise, if you give him time, will go just as far as Achilles.  Tristram Shandy, as we know, employed two years in chronicling the  first two days of his life, and lamented that, at this rate, material  would accumulate faster than he could deal with it, so that, as years  went by, he would be farther and farther from the end of his history.  Now I maintain that, if he had lived for ever, and had not wearied of  his task, then, even if his life had continued as event fully as it  began, no part of his biography would have remained unwritten. For  consider: the hundredth day will be described in the hundredth year,  the thousandth in the thousandth year, and so on. Whatever day we may  choose as so far on that he cannot hope to reach it, that day will be  described in the corresponding year. Thus any day that may be  mentioned will be written up sooner or later, and therefore no part of  the biography will remain permanently unwritten. This paradoxical but  perfectly true proposition depends upon the fact that the number of  days in all time is no greater than the number of years.    Thus on the subject of infinity it is impossible to avoid conclusions  which at first sight appear paradoxical, and this is the reason why so  many philosophers have supposed that there were inherent  contradictions in the infinite. But a little practice enables one to  grasp the true principles of Cantor's doctrine, and to acquire new and  better instincts as to the true and the false. The oddities then  become no odder than the people at the antipodes, who used to be  thought impossible because they would find it so inconvenient to stand  on their heads.    The solution of the problems concerning infinity has enabled Cantor to  solve also the problems of continuity. Of this, as of infinity, he has  given a perfectly precise definition, and has shown that there are no  contradictions in the notion so defined. But this subject is so  technical that it is impossible to give any account of it here.    The notion of continuity depends upon that of _order_, since  continuity is merely a particular type of order. Mathematics has, in  modern times, brought order into greater and greater prominence. In  former days, it was supposed (and philosophers are still apt to  suppose) that quantity was the fundamental notion of mathematics. But  nowadays, quantity is banished altogether, except from one little  corner of Geometry, while order more and more reigns supreme. The  investigation of different kinds of series and their relations is now  a very large part of mathematics, and it has been found that this  investigation can be conducted without any reference to quantity, and,  for the most part, without any reference to number. All types of  series are capable of formal definition, and their properties can be  deduced from the principles of symbolic logic by means of the Algebra  of Relatives. The notion of a limit, which is fundamental in the  greater part of higher mathematics, used to be defined by means of  quantity, as a term to which the terms of some series approximate as  nearly as we please. But nowadays the limit is defined quite  differently, and the series which it limits may not approximate to it  at all. This improvement also is due to Cantor, and it is one which  has revolutionised mathematics. Only order is now relevant to limits.  Thus, for instance, the smallest of the infinite integers is the limit  of the finite integers, though all finite integers are at an infinite  distance from it. The study of different types of series is a general  subject of which the study of ordinal numbers (mentioned above) is a  special and very interesting branch. But the unavoidable  technicalities of this subject render it impossible to explain to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#17)"],[1,"in time to hear Master Pawson say,  in his high-pitched voice and in a tone of anger that was quite new--    \"Oh, there you are, Martlet!  What is the meaning of all this folly?  Rogers dressed up, and telling me I can't come in without an order from  her ladyship.\"    \"Quite right, sir,\" said Ben, steadily; \"only he didn't know he was to  let in any one belonging to the place.\"    \"But what does it mean?  I've been out since morning, and I return to  find the gate locked, and a man playing at being a sentry.  Why, Roy, my  dear boy, surely this is not some bad joke of yours?\"    \"Unfasten the gate, Rogers, and let Master Pawson in,\" said Roy, with  his face turning scarlet; and, seeing his look of confusion, the  secretary continued--    \"Oh, I see; it is playing at soldiers.  And gracious me! who are those  under the gate-way?  Surely troops have not arrived in my absence.  My  dear Roy, surely her ladyship does not countenance this?  It is too  absurd.\"    Annoyance made the boy feel indignant, and he knew that those near him  expected him to speak on their behalf.    \"It is not absurd, Master Pawson,\" he replied, sharply.  \"The castle is  being placed under military rule now, and will be put in a state of  defence as soon as possible.\"    \"That's so!\" growled Ben, whose face was black as a thunder-cloud.    Master Pawson gave him a quick look, but he did not speak to him, but to  Roy.    \"A state of defence!\" he said, in a tone of raillery; \"what nonsense!  and pray, why?\"    \"On account of the troubled times, sir.\"    \"Troubled times!  What troubled times?\"    \"Surely you know, sir, who have been bringing my mother news of the  revolution.\"    Master Pawson's eyes opened a little more widely, for he was astonished.  The boy addressing him seemed no longer the quiet, sport-loving pupil  who came up into the tower to read with him and listen patiently while  he played on his violoncello, but one who had suddenly been transformed.    \"Ah, you mean the tidings of those people who object to some of the  king's orders?  But really that has nothing to do with us out here in  this quiet, retired place.  And you are making it an excuse for all this  folly?  For shame, Roy!  Dressing up the servants, and putting on a  sword!  Go and take it off, boy, and do not make yourself ridiculous.\"    Ben glanced at his young master, whose face was redder than ever, and  waited impatiently for him to speak, while Master Pawson turned towards  his pupil smilingly, extending one hand to lay upon his shoulder, the  other to lay hold of his sword.    \"There is nothing absurd or nonsensical about it, Master Pawson,\" he  said, firmly.  \"As I have told you, the castle will be put in a state of  defence.\"    \"You mean repair, my dear boy,\" said the secretary, mockingly.    \"Yes, repair if you will, as to the weak parts, sir.  And as to playing  at soldiers, we may look a little awkward at first, as we are not used  to our weapons and arms; but that will soon pass off, and you will have  to join us, and do your best.\"    \"That's so!\" growled Ben, whose face began to lighten up a little as Roy  spoke out so firmly.    Master Pawson turned upon the old soldier with his eyebrows raised in a  look of surprise.    \"My good man,\" he said, \"will you please to recollect your position  here.\"    Ben saluted, and drew himself up as stiff as a pike.    \"Nonsense, my dear boy!\" continued Master Pawson; \"this is all foolish  vanity, and I am sure that, when you have thought it over coolly, you  will see that it is childish for you, a boy, to imagine that you can do  any good by making this silly display.  Why, you must have been reading  some old book of chivalry and warlike adventure.  If you only knew how  ridiculous you look with that long sword buckled on, you would soon take  it off.  You look almost as absurd as Rogers here; I thought some  scarecrow had been stuck up by the gate.\"    \"Yes, sir; that's right,\" growled Ben.  \"Scarecrows who were going to  scare off all the crows as try to peck at his majesty the king.\"    \"Silence, Martlet!\" cried Roy, sharply.  \"It is not your place to speak  to Master Pawson like that.\"    \"I should think not,\" said the secretary, with his face flushing  slightly.    \"Beg pardon, sir, a slip: not mutiny,\" said Ben.    \"No, but insolence on the part of a menial,\" cried Master Pawson; \"and  if it is repeated, I shall ask Lady Royland to dismiss you, sir, at  once.\"    \"And my mother would refuse to dismiss so old and faithful a servant,\"  said Roy, warmly.    The secretary looked at the boy wonderingly again, and his eyes  darkened; but he smiled the next moment.    \"Come, come, Roy!\" he said.  \"Pray leave off this nonsense, and have the  gate left open.  Send the men back to their work.  You will thank me for  giving you this advice to-morrow.\"    \"No, Master Pawson, I shall not,\" said Roy, firmly.  \"The gate will be  kept locked; no one will be allowed to pass without the word, and  to-night the drawbridge will be raised; by to-morrow, I dare say, we  shall be able to lower the portcullis.\"    \"Are you mad, my boy?\"    \"I hope not, sir.\"    \"Do you mean to tell me that you will not listen to my advice?\"    \"Yes, sir; I cannot.\"    \"Then, my good lad, I must be severe.  I have tried gentle means.  As  your tutor, in whose charge you have been left by your father, I command  you to give up all this silly mummery.  You have something better to do  than to waste time over such childish tricks.  Go to your room, and stay  there for a while before you come to mine with an apology.  Quick!  At  once!\"    He stood, looking very important, as he gave a quick stamp and pointed  towards the castle.    \"You, Jenkin, go and put that sword away!  Rogers and Martlet, go back  to your work at once!\"    \"Stop!\" said Roy, firmly, as the men looked at him for help.  \"Keep as  you are.  Master Pawson is my tutor, but he has no right to give you any  orders.--I must ask you, sir, to go to your room, and not to interfere  with what is going on around.\"    \"Hah!\" ejaculated Ben, expelling a tremendous pent-up breath, and he  turned and winked at Rogers and Jenk, though the poor old gate-keeper  could not see.    \"The boy is mad,\" cried Master Pawson, flushing angrily now.  \"This is  beyond bearing.  An act of rebellion.  Once more, sir, will you obey  me?\"    \"Obey you, Master Pawson?  In my studies, yes.  Over the business of the  castle, no!\"    \"I am striving to save you from being ridiculed by the whole district,  sir, and I appeal to you not to force me to have you humbled by going in  to complain to Lady Royland.\"    \"You will not humble me, sir, by going in to complain to my mother, for  she endorses everything I have done.\"    \"Her ladyship does!\" cried Master Pawson, looking quite aghast.    \"Of course.  All this is by my father's orders.\"    \"Absurd, boy!  Your father has given no such orders.\"    \"Indeed!\" said Roy, flushing angrily at the contradiction.  \"You have  not been at home, sir, or you would have seen his messengers, three  troopers, ride up this morning, from his regiment, who will stay to help  us strengthen the place.  There they are!  I hope you don't think they  look ridiculous in their uniforms.\"    For, as he was speaking, the three men, rested now and refreshed, had  marched from the servants' hall to where the new recruits were drawn up,  and stood there waiting for their captain to return.    For a few moments Master Pawson's face dropped, and he stared in his  utter astonishment.    But he recovered himself quickly, and said, with a smile--    \"Of course I did not know of this, my dear boy, especially as it all was  while I have been away.  As your father has given the orders in his  letter,--and I am very glad that your mother has heard at last,--of  course there is nothing to be done, unless her ladyship can be brought  to see how unnecessary it all is, and likely to cause trouble and  misconstruction among the neighbours.  I am sure that if Sir Granby  could be here now, he would see that it was needless.  Whatever troubles  may arise, nothing can disturb us in this secluded spot.  There, I will  go now to attend to my reading.  When you have done playing at  soldiers,\" he added, with a slightly mocking emphasis upon the  \"playing\", \"perhaps you will join me, Roy.  You will get tired of  handling swords too large for your hand, but of studies you can never  weary.  _Au revoir_.  I am sorry we had this little misunderstanding.\"    He patted Roy on the shoulder and walked on across the drawbridge, as if  not perceiving that his pupil followed him; and as he drew near the  servants, ranged rather awkwardly in their fresh habiliments, he smiled  in a way which made every man shrink and feel far more uncomfortable  than he had been made by his stiff buff coat.  But as he passed the  three troopers,--fine, manly-looking, seasoned fellows, who wore their  uniforms as if to the manner born, and who drew themselves up and  saluted him, evidently looking upon him as one of the important  personages of the house,--he ceased to smile, and went on to his study  in the north-west tower, looking very serious and much disturbed in  mind.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    GUNS AND NO POWDER?    Very little more was done with the men that day, for, in spite of Roy's  spirited behaviour, he felt afterwards that Master Pawson had cast a  damp upon the proceedings.  Still, he knew that something must be done  to counteract that sneering smile distributed among the men by the  tutor; and upon his return to the rank he walked to and fro, and  expressed his satisfaction at the promptitude they had displayed, and,  after ordering them to assemble at nine the next morning, he dismissed  them.  For the messenger had returned with the village carpenter, who  took one of the old capstan-bars for a pattern, and undertook to have  half a dozen new ones of the strongest oak made by the next morning.
