For those who preferred quality to  quantity, and who did not mind getting torn by briers, this was  undoubtedly the place to come. In pockets of fine river-sand, their  roots stretching into the stream, grew the very biggest and finest of  the snowdrops. Most of them peeped through a very tangle of brambles;  but who minded scratched arms and torn sleeves to secure such treasures?    \"Look at these. The stalks must be nine inches long, and the flower's  nearly as big as a Lent lily,\" exulted Ulyth. \"I shall send them to  Mother, with some hazel catkins and some lovely moss.\"    \"Everybody will be sending away boxes to-night,\" said Addie. \"The  postman will have a load.\"    \"What's that?\" cried Lizzie, for a sudden rush and scuffle sounded on  the other side of the stream, a rat leaped wildly from the bank, and a  shaved poodle half jumped, half fell after it into the water.    The rat was gone in an eighth of a second, but the dog found himself in  difficulties. It was a case of \"look before you leap\", and a fat,  wheezy, French poodle is not at home in a quick-rushing stream.    \"Oh, the poor little beast's drowning!\" exclaimed Ulyth in horror.    Rona, with extreme promptitude, had flown to the rescue. Close by where  they stood the trunk of a half-fallen alder stretched out over the  water. It was green and slippery, and anything but an inviting bridge,  but she crawled along it somehow, and, clinging with one hand, contrived  to reach the dog's collar with the other and hold him up. What she would  have done next it is impossible to say, for he was too heavy to lift in  her already precarious position; but at that moment a gentleman,  evidently in quest of his pet, parted the hazel boughs and took in the  situation at a glance.    \"Hold hard a moment,\" he called, and, scrambling down the bank, managed  to make a long arm and hook his stick into the poodle's collar and drag  the almost strangled creature to shore.    Until Rona had cautiously wriggled round on the bough, and crept back  safely, the spectators watched in considerable anxiety. They need not  have been alarmed, however, for after her many New Zealand experiences  she thought this a very poor affair.    The owner of the dog shouted his thanks from the opposite bank of the  stream and disappeared behind the high hedge. The whole episode had not  taken five minutes.    \"Do you know who that was? It was Lord Glyncraig,\" said Addie in rather  awestruck tones.    \"Was it? Well, I'm sure I don't care,\" returned Rona a trifle defiantly.  \"I'd have saved John Jones's dog quite as readily.\"    \"What a pity he didn't ask your name! He might have invited you to tea  at Plas Cafn, then you'd have scored over Stephie no end.\"    \"I'm sure I don't want to go to tea at Plas Cafn, thank you,\" snapped  Rona, rather out of temper.    \"But think of the fun of it,\" persisted Addie. \"I only wish they'd ask  me.\"    \"They won't ask any of us, so what's the use of talking?\" said Lizzie.  \"Let's go back to the others; it must be time for lunch.\"    They found the rest of the girls seated on the wall, as being the driest  spot available, and already attacking their packets of sandwiches. Some  had even reached the jam-tartlet stage.    \"It's a good thing we've each got our own private basket, or there  wouldn't be much left for you,\" shouted Mary Acton. \"Where have you been  all this while?\"    \"Consorting with members of the Peerage,\" said Addie airily. \"Oh yes, my  dear girl! We've had quite what you might call a confidential talk down  by the stream with Lord Glyncraig.\"    \"Not really?\" asked Stephanie, pricking up her ears.    \"Really and truly! He's not your special property any longer. Rona has  quite supplanted you.\"    \"I don't believe it. You're ragging.\" Stephanie was rather pink and  indignant.    \"Ask the others, if you want to know.\"    No one was particularly sorry to take a rest after all the scrambling.  The lunch tasted good out-of-doors, and the last tartlet had soon  disappeared. Rona, perched on a tree-stump, began her orange, and tossed  long yellow strands of peel on to the bank below her.    \"Oh, stop that, before Teddie catches you!\" urged Ulyth; but she was too  late, for Miss Teddington had already spied the offending pieces.    \"Who threw those?\" she demanded. \"Then, Rona Mitchell, you ought to be  ashamed of yourself. Go and pick them up at once, and put them inside  your basket. What do you think the field will look like if more than  fifty people strew it with orange-peel and sandwich-paper! We don't come  here to spoil the beautiful spots we have been enjoying. I should be  utterly disgraced if the school behaved like a party of cheap-trippers.  Woodlanders ought to respect all natural scenery. I thought you would  have learnt that by this time, but it appears you haven't. Don't forget  it again.\"    Much crushed, Rona collected the peel, and, wrapping it carefully in her  piece of sandwich-paper, put it in the very bottom of her basket, under  a layer of catkins. The girls had brought bobbins of thread with them,  and were making their snowdrops into little bunches, with ivy leaves and  lambs'-tails from the hazel. A few lucky explorers had even found some  palm opening on the sallows. Several had nature notes to contribute.  Nellie Barlow and Gladys Broughton had seen a real weasel, and plumed  themselves accordingly, till Evie Isherwood capped their story by  producing the remains of a last year's chaffinch's nest she had found in  a tree.    \"If I said I'd seen a snake, should I be believed?\" whispered Rona.    \"Certainly not. Everyone knows that snakes hibernate; so don't try it  on,\" returned Ulyth, laughing.    \"Half-past two. We must be going back at once, girls, or there won't be  time to send off your snowdrops,\" said Miss Teddington. \"Pack your  baskets and come along.\"          CHAPTER X    Trespassers Beware!      The girls left the snowdrop field with reluctance, though they realized  the necessity for hurry. Nearly everyone wished to dispatch her spoils  home, and unless the boxes were sent very early to the post-office the  chances were that there would not be time for the postmaster to stamp  them officially, and that they might languish somewhere in the  background of the village shop until next day, and consequently arrive  at their destination in an utterly withered condition.    The school scrambled back along the top of the wall, therefore, with  what haste the brambles and hazel-bushes allowed them, splashed  recklessly among the pools of the flooded lane, and regained the high  road with quite record speed. Ulyth, walking with Lizzie Lonsdale, had  left Rona in the rear. Rona, owing to her intimacy with Ulyth, tried to  tag on to V B, often receiving snubs from some of its members. Her own  form-mates were all considerably younger than herself. At first they had  teased her shamelessly, but since the Christmas holidays, recognizing  that she was gaining a more established position in the school, they  had begun to treat her more mercifully. Some of them were really rather  jolly children, and though twelve seems young to fourteen, the poor  Cuckoo was still a lonely enough bird to welcome any crumbs of  friendship thrown in her way.    At the present moment Winnie Fowler and Hattie Goodwin were clinging to  her arms, one on either side. Their motives, I fear, were a trifle  mixed. They found Rona amusing and liked her company, but also they were  tired and found if they dragged a little she would pull them along  without remonstrance.    \"My shoes are ever so wet,\" boasted Winnie. \"I plumped down deep in the  lane, and the water went right through the laces at the top. It  squelches as I walk. I feel like a soldier in the trenches.\"    \"I've torn my coat in three places,\" said Hattie, not to be outdone. \"It  will be a nice little piece of work for Mrs. Johnson to mend it.\"    \"Glad they don't make us mend our own coats here,\" grunted Winnie.    \"Miss Bowes would be ashamed to see me in it if I did,\" Hattie chuckled,  \"but I've knitted a whole sock since Christmas, and turned the heel too.  Cuckoo, aren't you tired?\"    \"Not a scrap,\" replied Rona, who was stumping along sturdily in spite of  her encumbrances.    \"Well, I am. I wish it wasn't three miles back.\"    \"It's not more than two as the crow flies.\"    \"But we're not crows, and we can't fly, and there are no aeroplanes to  give us a lift. We've got to tramp, tramp, tramp along the hard high  road. I begin to sympathize with Tommies on the march.\"    \"Why need we stick to the high road?\" said Rona, pausing suddenly. \"If  we struck across country we'd save a mile or more. Look, The Woodlands  is over there, and if we made a beeline for it we'd cut off all that  enormous round by Cefn Mawr. Who's game to try?\"    \"Oh, I am, if we can dodge Teddie!\"    \"Likewise this child,\" added Winnie.    \"Oh, we'll dodge Teddie right enough! It will be good scouting  practice,\" chuckled Rona. \"Sit down on that stone and tie your shoelace,  and we'll wait for you while the others go on; then we'll bolt through  that gate and over the wall into the next field.\"    The idea that it was scouting practice lent a vestige of sanction to the  proceeding. Winnie took the hint, and adjusted her shoelaces with  elaborate care and deliberation.    \"Don't be all day over that,\" said Miss Teddington, who passed by but  did not wait.    The moment she was round the corner of the road, and the high hedge  screened her from view, the three deserters were through the gate and  running across the field. They scaled a wall without much difficulty,  and found themselves on a wide gorse-grown pasture. Though they could  not now see the chimneys of The Woodlands in the distance, there were  other landmarks quite sufficient to guide them. They plodded on  cheerfully.    \"It would be prime to have our snowdrops all packed up before the  others got back,\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20733"],[0,"Critical Miscellanies (Vol. 1 of 3), Essay 1: Robespierre (#17)"],[1,"with a short mental reach, she stamps him with the very  definition of mediocrity.    How can we speak with decent patience of a man who seriously thought  that he should conciliate the conservative and theological elements of  the society at his feet, by such an odious opera-piece as the Feast of  the Supreme Being? This was designed as a triumphant ripost to the Feast  of Reason, which Chaumette and his friends had celebrated in the winter.  The energumens of the Goddess of Reason had now been some weeks in  their bloody graves; by this time, if they had given the wrong answer to  the supreme enigma, their eyes would perhaps be opened. Robespierre  persuaded the Convention to decree an official recognition of the  Supreme Being, and to attend a commemorative festival in honour of their  mystic patron. He contrived to be chosen president for the decade in  which the festival would fall. When the day came (20th Prairial, June 8,  1794), he clothed himself with more than even his usual care. As he  looked out from the windows of the Tuileries upon the jubilant crowd in  the gardens, he was intoxicated with enthusiasm. 'O Nature,' he cried,  'how sublime thy power, how full of delight! How tyrants must grow pale  at the idea of such a festival as this!' In pontifical pride he walked  at the head of the procession, with flowers and wheat-ears in his hand,  to the sound of chants and symphonies and choruses of maidens. On the  first of the great basins in the gardens, David, the artist, had devised  an allegorical structure for which an inauspicious doom was prepared.  Atheism, a statue of life size, was throned in the midst of an amiable  group of human Vices, with Madness by her side, and Wisdom menacing them  with lofty wrath. Great are the perils of symbolism. Robespierre applied  a torch to Atheism, but alas, the wind was hostile, or else Atheism and  Madness were damp. They obstinately resisted the torch, and it was  hapless Wisdom who took fire. Her face, all blackened by smoke, grinned  a hideous ghastly grin at her sturdy rivals. The miscarriage of the  allegory was an evil omen, and men probably thought how much better the  churchmen always managed their conjurings and the art of spectacle.  There was a great car drawn by milk-white oxen; in the front were ranged  sheaves of golden grain, while at the back shepherds and shepherdesses  posed with scenic graces. The whole mummery was pagan. It was a bringing  back of Cerealia and Thesmophoria to earth. It stands as the most  disgusting and contemptible anachronism in history.    The famous republican Calendar, with its Prairials and Germinals, its  Ventoses and Pluvioses, was an anachronism of the same kind, though it  was less despicable in its manifestation. Its philosophic base was just  as retrograde and out of season as the fooleries of the Feast of the  Supreme Being. The association of worship and sacredness with the fruits  of the earth, with the forces of nature, with the power and variety of  the elements, could only be sincere so long as men really thought of all  these things as animated each by a special will of its own. Such an  association became mere charlatanry, when knowledge once passed into the  positive stage. How could men go back to adore an outer world, after  they had found out the secret that it is a mere huge group of phenomena,  following fixed courses, and not obeying spontaneous and unaccountable  volitions of their own? And what could be more puerile than the fanciful  connection of the Supreme Being with a pastoral simplicity of life? This  simplicity was gone, irrecoverably gone, with the passage from nomad  times to the complexities of a modern society. To typify, therefore, the  Supreme Being as specially interested in shocks of grain and in  shepherds and shepherdesses was to make him a mere figure in an idyll,  the ornament of a rural mask, a god of the garden, instead of the  sovereign director of the universal forces, and stern master of the  destinies of men. Chaumette's commemoration of the Divinity of Reason  was a sensible performance, compared with Robespierre's farcical  repartee. It was something, as Comte has said, to select for worship  man's most individual attribute. If they could not contemplate society  as a whole, it was at least a gain to pay homage to that faculty in the  human rulers of the world, which had brought the forces of nature--its  pluviosity, nivosity, germinality, and vendemiarity--under the yoke for  the service of men.    If the philosophy of Robespierre's pageant was so retrograde and false,  its politics were still more inane. It is a monument of presumptuous  infatuation that any one should feel so strongly as he did that order  could only be restored on condition of coming to terms with religious  use and prejudice, and then that he should dream that his Supreme  Being--a mere didactic phrase, the deity of a poet's georgic--should  adequately replace that eternal marvel of construction, by means of  which the great churchmen had wrought dogma and liturgy and priest and  holy office into every hour and every mood of men's lives. There is no  binding principle of human association in a creed with this one bald  article. 'In truth,' as I have said elsewhere of such deism as  Robespierre's, 'one can scarcely call it a creed. It is mainly a name  for a particular mood of fine spiritual exaltation; the expression of a  state of indefinite aspiration and supreme feeling for lofty things. Are  you going to convert the new barbarians of our western world with this  fair word of emptiness? Will you sweeten the lives of suffering men, and  take its heaviness from that droning piteous chronicle of wrong and  cruelty and despair, which everlastingly saddens the compassionating ear  like moaning of a midnight sea; will you animate the stout of heart with  new fire, and the firm of hand with fresh joy of battle, by the thought  of a being without intelligible attributes, a mere abstract creation of  metaphysic, whose mercy is not as our mercy, nor his justice as our  justice, nor his fatherhood as the fatherhood of men? It was not by a  cold, a cheerless, a radically depraving conception such as this, that  the church became the refuge of humanity in the dark times of old, but  by the representation, to men sitting in bondage and confusion, of  godlike natures moving among them, under figure of the most eternally  touching of human relations,--a tender mother ever interceding for them,  and an elder brother laying down his life that their burdens might be  loosened.'           *       *       *       *       *    On the day of the Feast of the Supreme Being, the guillotine was  concealed in the folds of rich hangings. It was the Twentieth of  Prairial. Two days later Couthon proposed to the Convention the  memorable Law of the Twenty-second Prairial. Robespierre was the  draftsman, and the text of it still remains in his own writing. This  monstrous law is simply the complete abrogation of all law. Of all laws  ever passed in the world it is the most nakedly iniquitous. Tyrants have  often substituted their own will for the ordered procedure of a  tribunal, but no tyrant before ever went through the atrocious farce of  deliberately making a tribunal the organised negation of security for  justice. Couthon laid its theoretic base in a fallacy that must always  be full of seduction to shallow persons in authority: 'He who would  subordinate the public safety to the inventions of jurisconsults, to the  formulas of the Court, is either an imbecile or a scoundrel.' As if  public safety could mean anything but the safety of the public. The  author of the Law of Prairial had forgotten the minatory word of the  sage to whom he had gone on a pilgrimage in the days of his youth. 'All  becomes legitimate and even virtuous,' Helvetius had written, 'on behalf  of the public safety.' Rousseau inscribed on the margin, 'The public  safety is nothing, unless individuals enjoy security.' What security was  possible under the Law of Prairial?    After the probity and good judgment of the tribunal, the two cardinal  guarantees in state trials are accurate definition, and proof. The  offence must be capable of precise description, and the proof against  an offender must conform to strict rule. The Law of Prairial violently  infringed all three of these essential conditions of judicial equity.  First, the number of the jury who had power to convict was reduced.  Second, treason was made to consist in such vague and infinitely elastic  kinds of action as inspiring discouragement, misleading opinion,  depraving manners, corrupting patriots, abusing the principles of the  Revolution by perfidious applications. Third, proof was to lie in the  conscience of the jury; there was an end of preliminary inquiry, of  witnesses in defence, and of counsel for the accused. Any kind of  testimony was evidence, whether material or moral, verbal or written, if  it was of a kind 'likely to gain the assent of a man of reasonable  mind.'    Now what was Robespierre's motive in devising this infernal instrument?  The theory that he loved judicial murder for its own sake, can only be  held by the silliest of royalist or clerical partisans. It is like the  theory of the vulgar kind of Protestantism, that Mary Tudor or Philip of  Spain had a keen delight in shedding blood. Robespierre, like Mary and  like Philip, would have been as well pleased if all the world would have  come round to his mind without the destruction of a single life. The  true inquisitor is a creature of policy, not a man of blood by taste.  What, then, was the policy that inspired the Law of Prairial? To us the  answer seems clear. We know what was the general aim in Robespierre's  mind at this point in the history of the Revolution. His brother  Augustin was then the representative of the Convention with the army of  Italy, and General Bonaparte was on terms of close"]]]
