I found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.\"    \"And what did she say?\" I can hear the good woman still, and the candor  of her stupefaction.    \"That she suffers the torments--!\"    It was this, of a truth, that made her, as she filled out my picture,  gape. \"Do you mean,\" she faltered, \"--of the lost?\"    \"Of the lost. Of the damned. And that's why, to share them-\" I faltered  myself with the horror of it.    But my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. \"To share them--?\"    \"She wants Flora.\" Mrs. Grose might, as I gave it to her, fairly have  fallen away from me had I not been prepared. I still held her there, to  show I was. \"As I've told you, however, it doesn't matter.\"    \"Because you've made up your mind? But to what?\"    \"To everything.\"    \"And what do you call 'everything'?\"    \"Why, sending for their uncle.\"    \"Oh, miss, in pity do,\" my friend broke out. \"ah, but I will, I WILL! I  see it's the only way. What's 'out,' as I told you, with Miles is that  if he thinks I'm afraid to--and has ideas of what he gains by that--he  shall see he's mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle shall have it here from me  on the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if I'm to be  reproached with having done nothing again about more school--\"    \"Yes, miss--\" my companion pressed me.    \"Well, there's that awful reason.\"    There were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she  was excusable for being vague. \"But--a--which?\"    \"Why, the letter from his old place.\"    \"You'll show it to the master?\"    \"I ought to have done so on the instant.\"    \"Oh, no!\" said Mrs. Grose with decision.    \"I'll put it before him,\" I went on inexorably, \"that I can't undertake  to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled--\"    \"For we've never in the least known what!\" Mrs. Grose declared.    \"For wickedness. For what else--when he's so clever and beautiful and  perfect? Is he stupid? Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is he ill-natured?  He's exquisite--so it can be only THAT; and that would open up the whole  thing. After all,\" I said, \"it's their uncle's fault. If he left here  such people--!\"    \"He didn't really in the least know them. The fault's mine.\" She had  turned quite pale.    \"Well, you shan't suffer,\" I answered.    \"The children shan't!\" she emphatically returned.    I was silent awhile; we looked at each other. \"Then what am I to tell  him?\"    \"You needn't tell him anything. _I_'ll tell him.\"    I measured this. \"Do you mean you'll write--?\" Remembering she couldn't,  I caught myself up. \"How do you communicate?\"    \"I tell the bailiff. HE writes.\"    \"And should you like him to write our story?\"    My question had a sarcastic force that I had not fully intended, and  it made her, after a moment, inconsequently break down. The tears were  again in her eyes. \"Ah, miss, YOU write!\"    \"Well--tonight,\" I at last answered; and on this we separated.          XVII      I went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. The weather had  changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my room,  with Flora at peace beside me, I sat for a long time before a blank  sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of  the gusts. Finally I went out, taking a candle; I crossed the passage  and listened a minute at Miles's door. What, under my endless obsession,  I had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his not being at  rest, and I presently caught one, but not in the form I had expected.  His voice tinkled out. \"I say, you there--come in.\" It was a gaiety in  the gloom!    I went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very  much at his ease. \"Well, what are YOU up to?\" he asked with a grace of  sociability in which it occurred to me that Mrs. Grose, had she been  present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was \"out.\"    I stood over him with my candle. \"How did you know I was there?\"    \"Why, of course I heard you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You're  like a troop of cavalry!\" he beautifully laughed.    \"Then you weren't asleep?\"    \"Not much! I lie awake and think.\"    I had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held  out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed.  \"What is it,\" I asked, \"that you think of?\"    \"What in the world, my dear, but YOU?\"    \"Ah, the pride I take in your appreciation doesn't insist on that! I had  so far rather you slept.\"    \"Well, I think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.\"    I marked the coolness of his firm little hand. \"Of what queer business,  Miles?\"    \"Why, the way you bring me up. And all the rest!\"    I fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper  there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow.  \"What do you mean by all the rest?\"    \"Oh, you know, you know!\"    I could say nothing for a minute, though I felt, as I held his hand and  our eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting  his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was perhaps at  that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. \"Certainly you shall go  back to school,\" I said, \"if it be that that troubles you. But not to  the old place--we must find another, a better. How could I know it did  trouble you, this question, when you never told me so, never spoke of it  at all?\" His clear, listening face, framed in its smooth whiteness, made  him for the minute as appealing as some wistful patient in a children's  hospital; and I would have given, as the resemblance came to me, all I  possessed on earth really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who  might have helped to cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps might  help! \"Do you know you've never said a word to me about your school--I  mean the old one; never mentioned it in any way?\"    He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly  gained time; he waited, he called for guidance. \"Haven't I?\" It wasn't  for ME to help him--it was for the thing I had met!    Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from  him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known;  so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his  little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part  of innocence and consistency. \"No, never--from the hour you came back.  You've never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of your comrades,  nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at school. Never,  little Miles--no, never--have you given me an inkling of anything that  MAY have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how much I'm in the  dark. Until you came out, that way, this morning, you had, since the  first hour I saw you, scarce even made a reference to anything in your  previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept the present.\" It was  extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret precocity (or  whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I dared but half  to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his inward trouble,  appear as accessible as an older person--imposed him almost as an  intellectual equal. \"I thought you wanted to go on as you are.\"    It struck me that at this he just faintly colored. He gave, at any rate,  like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his head. \"I  don't--I don't. I want to get away.\"    \"You're tired of Bly?\"    \"Oh, no, I like Bly.\"    \"Well, then--?\"    \"Oh, YOU know what a boy wants!\"    I felt that I didn't know so well as Miles, and I took temporary refuge.  \"You want to go to your uncle?\"    Again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the  pillow. \"Ah, you can't get off with that!\"    I was silent a little, and it was I, now, I think, who changed color.  \"My dear, I don't want to get off!\"    \"You can't, even if you do. You can't, you can't!\"--he lay beautifully  staring. \"My uncle must come down, and you must completely settle  things.\"    \"If we do,\" I returned with some spirit, \"you may be sure it will be to  take you quite away.\"    \"Well, don't you understand that that's exactly what I'm working for?  You'll have to tell him--about the way you've let it all drop: you'll  have to tell him a tremendous lot!\"    The exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow, for the  instant, to meet him rather more. \"And how much will YOU, Miles, have to  tell him? There are things he'll ask you!\"    He turned it over. \"Very likely. But what things?\"    \"The things you've never told me. To make up his mind what to do with  you. He can't send you back--\"    \"Oh, I don't want to go back!\" he broke in. \"I want a new field.\"    He said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable  gaiety; and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the  poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappearance  at the end of three months with all this bravado and still more  dishonor. It overwhelmed me now that I should never be able to bear  that, and it made me let myself go. I threw myself upon him and in the  tenderness of my pity I embraced him. \"Dear little Miles, dear little  Miles--!\"    My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with  indulgent good humor. \"Well, old lady?\"    \"Is there nothing--nothing at all that you want to tell me?\"    He turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his  hand to look at as one had seen sick children look. \"I've told you--I  told you this morning.\"    Oh, I was sorry for him! \"That you just want me not to worry you?\"    He looked round at me now, as if in recognition of my understanding him;  then ever so gently, \"To let me alone,\" he replied.    There was even a singular little dignity in it, something that made me  release him, yet,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#17)"],[1,"under any pretext whatever.--Proposed Va.       Constitution.[89]         The General Assembly (of Virginia) shall not have power to ...       permit the introduction of any more slaves to reside in this       State, or the continuance of slavery beyond the generation which       shall be living on the 31st day of December, 1800; all persons       born after that day being hereby declared free.[90]--Proposed       Constitution for Virginia.         After the year 1800 of the Christian era, there shall be neither       slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said States,       otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall       have been duly convicted to have been personally       guilty.[91]--Proposed Ordinance of 1784.         \"The clause respecting slavery,\" said he \"was lost by an       individual vote only. Ten States were present. The four Eastern       States, New York and Pennsylvania, were for the clause. Jersey       would have been for it, but there were but two members, one of       whom was sick in his chambers. South Carolina, Maryland, and       Virginia! voted against it. North Carolina was divided, as would       have been Virginia, had not one of its delegates been sick in       bed.\"[92]         \"I congratulate you\" said he to a coworker, \"on the law of your       state (South Carolina) for suspending the importation of slaves,       and for the glory you have justly acquired by endeavoring to       prevent it forever.\"[93]      VII    Jefferson seemed to get further from the idea of immediate  emancipation, looking upon it as a very serious problem. He tended, as  the following extracts will show, to advocate lightening the burden of  the slave, hoping that in the West Indies, where he thought the Negro  would eventually rule absolutely, the blacks might establish  governments to which freedmen gradually emancipated in the United  States might be sent to shape their own destiny.    Writing to Dr. Price concerning his anti-slavery pamphlet, Jefferson  said:         Southward of the Chesapeake, your pamphlet (against slavery) will       find but few readers concurring with it in sentiment on the       subject of slavery. From the mouth to the head of the Chesapeake,       the bulk of the people will approve it in theory, and it will       find a respectable minority ready to adopt it in practice; a       minority which for weight and worth of character preponderates       against the greater number, who have not the courage to divest       their families of a property which, however, keeps their       conscience unquiet. Northward of the Chesapeake, you may find       here and there an opponent to your doctrine, as you may find here       and there a robber and murderer; but in no greater number. In       that part of America, there being but few slaves, they can easily       disencumber themselves of them; and emancipation is put into such       a train that in a few years there will be no slaves northward of       Maryland. In Maryland, I do not find such a disposition to begin       the redress of this enormity as in Virginia. This is the next       State to which we may turn our eyes for the interesting spectacle       of justice in conflict with avarice and oppression; a conflict       wherein the sacred side is gaining daily recruits from the influx       into office of young men grown, and growing up. These have sucked       in the principles of liberty, as it were, with their mother's       milk; and it is to them I look with anxiety to turn the fate of       this question. Be not therefore discouraged. What you have       written will do a great deal of good.[94]    In his report to Congress of a conference with Count Vergennes,  Foreign Minister of France, on commerce, Jefferson wrote:         The British army, after ravaging the State of Virginia, had sent       off a very great number of slaves to New York. By the seventh       article of the treaty of peace, they stipulated not to carry away       any of these. Notwithstanding this, it was known, when they were       evacuating New York, that they were carrying away the slaves,       General Washington made an official demand of Sir Guy Carleton,       that he should cease to send them away. He answered, that these       people had come to them under promise of the King's protection,       and that that promise should be fulfilled in preference to the       stipulation in the treaty. The State of Virginia, to which nearly       the whole of these slaves belonged, passed a law to forbid the       recovery of debts due to British subjects. They declared, at the       same time, they would repeal the law, if Congress were of opinion       they ought to do it. But, desirous that their citizens should be       discharging their debts, they afterwards permitted British       creditors to prosecute their suits, and to receive their debts in       seven equal and annual payments for reimbursement.[95]    Jefferson's letter here to M. de Meunier on the passage of the  Ordinance of 1787 shows how he either shifted from his position of  regarding emancipation a serious problem to that of agitating against  slavery or that he varied his correspondence to suit the person  addressed.         There were ten States present; six voted unanimously for it,       three against it, and one was divided; and seven votes being       requisite to decide the proposition affirmatively, it was lost.       The voice of a single individual of the State which was divided,       or of one of those which were of the negative, would have       prevented this abominable crime from spreading itself over the       new country. Thus we see the fate of millions unborn hanging on       the tongue of one man, and heaven was silent in that awful       moment! But it is to be hoped it will not always be silent, and       that the friends to the rights of human nature will in the end       prevail.         What a stupendous, what an incomprehensible machine is man! who       can endure toil, famine, stripes, imprisonment, and death itself,       in vindication of his own liberty, and, the next moment, be deaf       to all those motives whose power supported him through his       trial, and inflict on his fellow men a bondage, one hour of which       is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in       rebellion to oppose.[96]    He seemed to regard it later as a problem to be solved only by  miraculous methods.         We must await with patience the workings of an overruling       Providence, and hope that that is preparing the deliverance of       these, our suffering brethren. When the measure of their tears       shall be full, when their groans shall have involved heaven       itself in darkness, doubtless a God of justice will awaken to       their distress, and by diffusing light and liberality among their       oppressors, or, at length, by His exterminating thunder, manifest       His attention to the things of this world, and that they are not       left to the guidance of a blind fatality.[97]    Jefferson, however, seemed to have a kind feeling for the bondmen, as  these extracts will show.         I observe in your letter ... that the profits of the whole estate       (of Monticello) would be no more than the hire of the few negroes       hired out would amount to. Would it be better to hire more where       good masters could be got? Would it be better to hire plantations       and all, if proper assurance can be provided for the good usage,       of everything?[98]         I am miserable till I shall owe not a shilling. The moment that       shall be the case, I shall feel myself at liberty to do something       for the comfort of the slaves.[99]         The check on the tenants against abusing my slaves was, by the       former lease, that I might discontinue it on a reference to       arbitrators. Would it not be well to retain an optional right to       sue them for ill-usage of the slaves or to discontinue it by       arbitration, whichever you should choose at the time?[100]         As far as I can judge from the experiments which have been made       to give liberty to, or rather, to abandon persons whose habits       have been formed in slavery is like abandoning children.[101]         I am decided on my final return to America to try this       experiment. I shall endeavor to import as many Germans as I have       grown slaves. I will settle them and my slaves, on farms of fifty       acres each, intermingled, and place all on the footing of the       Metayers (Medietaini) of Europe. Their children shall be brought       up, as others are, in habits of property and foresight, and I       have no doubt but that they will be good citizens. Some of their       fathers will be so; others I suppose will need government. With       these all that can be done is to oblige them to labor as the       laboring poor of Europe do, and to apply to their comfortable       subsistence the produce of their labor, retaining such a moderate       portion of it as may be a just equivalent for the use of the       lands they labor, and the stocks and other necessary       advances.[102]         The inculcation (in your book) on the master of the moral duties       which he owes to the slave, in return for the benefits of his       service, that is to say, of food, clothing, care in sickness, and       maintenance under age and disability, so as to make him in fact       as comfortable and more secure than the laboring man in most       parts of the world, ... gives great merit to the work, and will,       I have no doubt, produce wholesome impressions.[103]         In the first or second session of the Legislature after I became       a member, I drew to this subject the attention of Colonel Bland,       one of the oldest, ablest, and most respected members, and he       undertook to move for certain moderate extensions "]]]
