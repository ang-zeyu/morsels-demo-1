The lives of Henry's queens have been best       narrated by Agnes Strickland.          CHAPTER V.    EDWARD VI. AND MARY.      [Sidenote: War with Scotland.]    Henry VIII. was succeeded by his son, Edward VI., a boy of nine years  of age, learned, pious, and precocious. Still he was a boy; and, as  such, was a king but in name. The history of his reign is the history  of the acts of his ministers.    The late king left a will, appointing sixteen persons, mostly members  of his council, to be guardians of his son, and rulers of the nation  during his minority. The Earl of Hertford, being uncle of the king,  was unanimously named protector.    The first thing the council did was to look after themselves, that is,  to give themselves titles and revenues. Hertford became Duke of  Somerset; Essex, Marquis of Northampton; Lisle, Earl of Warwick; the  Chancellor Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. At the head of these  nobles was Somerset. He was a Protestant, and therefore prosecuted  those reforms which Cranmer had before projected. Cranmer, as member  of the council, archbishop of Canterbury, and friend of Somerset, had  ample scope to prosecute his measures.    The history of this reign is not important in a political point of  view, and relates chiefly to the completion of the reformation, and to  the squabbles and jealousies of the great lords who formed the council  of regency.    The most important event, of a political character, was a war with  Scotland, growing out of the attempts of the late king to unite both  nations under one government. In consequence, Scotland was invaded by  the Duke of Somerset, at the head of eighteen thousand men. A great  battle was fought, in which ten thousand of the Scots were slain. But  the protector was compelled to return to England, without following up  the fruits of victory, in consequence of cabals at court. His brother,  Lord Seymour, a man of reckless ambition, had married the queen  dowager, and openly aspired to the government of the kingdom. He  endeavored to seduce the youthful king, and he had provided arms for  ten thousand men.    The protector sought to win his brother from his treasonable designs  by kindness and favors; but, all his measures proving ineffectual, he  was arrested, tried, and executed, for high treason.    [Sidenote: Rebellions and Discontents.]    But Somerset had a more dangerous enemy than his brother; and this was  the Earl of Warwick, who obtained great popularity by his suppression  of a dangerous insurrection, the greatest the country had witnessed  since Jack Cade's rebellion, one hundred years before. The discontent  of the people appears to have arisen from their actual suffering. Coin  had depreciated, without a corresponding rise of wages, and labor was  cheap, because tillage lands were converted to pasturage. The popular  discontent was aggravated by the changes which the reformers  introduced, and which the peasantry were the last to appreciate. The  priests and ejected monks increased the discontent, until it broke out  into a flame.    The protector made himself unpopular with the council by a law which  he caused to be passed against enclosures; and, as he lost influence,  his great rival, Warwick, gained power. Somerset, at last, was obliged  to resign his protectorship; and Warwick, who had suppressed the  rebellion, formed the chief of a new council of regency. He was a man  of greater talents than Somerset, and equal ambition, and more fitted  for stormy times.    As soon as his power was established, and the country was at peace,  and he had gained friends, he began to execute those projects of  ambition which he had long formed. The earldom of Northumberland  having reverted to the crown, Warwick aspired to the extinct title and  the estates, and procured for himself a grant of the same, with the  title of duke. But there still remained a bar to his elevation; and  this was the opposition of the Duke of Somerset, who, though disgraced  and unpopular, was still powerful. It is unfortunate to be in the way  of a great man's career, and Somerset paid the penalty of his  opposition--the common fate of unsuccessful rivals in unsettled times.  He was accused of treason, condemned, and executed, (1552.)    [Sidenote: Rivalry of the Great Nobles.]    Northumberland, as the new dictator, seemed to have attained the  highest elevation to which a subject could aspire. In rank, power, and  property, he was second only to the royal family, but his ambition  knew no bounds, and he began his intrigues to induce the young king,  whose health was rapidly failing, and who was zealously attached to  Protestantism, to set aside the succession of his sister Mary to the  throne, really in view of the danger to which the reformers would be  subjected, but under pretence of her declared illegitimacy, which  would also set aside the claims of the Princess Elizabeth. Mary, Queen  of Scots, was to be set aside on the ground of the will of the late  king, and the succession would therefore devolve on the Lady Jane  Grey, granddaughter of the Duke of Suffolk and of the French queen,  whom he hoped to unite in marriage with his son. This was a  deeply-laid scheme, and came near being successful, since Edward  listened to it with pleasure. Northumberland then sought to gain over  the judges and other persons of distinction, and succeeded by bribery  and intimidation. At this juncture, the young king died, possessed of  all the accomplishments which could grace a youth of sixteen, but  still a tool in the hands of his ministers.    [Sidenote: Religious Reforms.]    Such were the political movements of this reign--memorable for the  rivalries of the great nobles. But it is chiefly distinguished for the  changes which were made in the church establishment, and the  introduction of the principles of the continental reformers. No  changes of importance were ever made beyond what Cranmer and his  associates effected. Indeed, all that an absolute monarch could do,  was done, and done with prudence, sagacity, and moderation. The people  quietly--except in some rural districts--acquiesced in the change.  Most of the clergy took the new oath of allegiance to Edward VI., as  supreme head of the church; and very few suffered from religious  persecution. There is no period in English history when such important  changes were made, with so little bloodshed. Cranmer always watched  the temper of the nation, and did nothing without great caution. Still  a great change was effected--no less than a complete change from  Romanism to Protestantism. But it was not so radical a reform as the  Puritans subsequently desired, since the hierarchy and a liturgy, and  clerical badges and dresses, were retained. It was the fortune of  Cranmer, during the six years of Edward's reign, to effect the two  great objects of which the English church has ever since been  proud--the removal of Roman abuses, and the establishment of the creed  of Luther and Calvin; and this without sweeping away the union of  church and state, which, indeed, was more intimate than before the  reformation. The papal power was completely subverted. Nothing more  remained to be done by Cranmer. He had compiled the Book of Common  Prayer, abolished the old Latin service, the worship of images, the  ceremony of the mass, and auricular confessions. He turned the altars  into communion tables, set up the singing of psalms in the service,  caused the communion to be administered in both kinds to the laity,  added the litany to the ritual, prepared a book of homilies for the  clergy, invited learned men to settle in England, and magnificently  endowed schools and universities.    The Reformation is divested of much interest, since it was the work of  _authority_, rather than the result of _popular convictions_. But  Cranmer won immortal honor for his skilful management, and for making  no more changes than he could sustain. A large part of the English  nation still regard his works as perfect, and are sincerely and  enthusiastically attached to the form which he gave to his church.    The hopes of his party were suddenly dispelled by the death of the  amiable prince whom he controlled, 6th of July, 1553. The succession  to the throne fell to the Princess Mary, or, as princesses were then  called, the _Lady_ Mary; nor could all the arts of Northumberland  exclude her from the enjoyment of her rights. This ambitious nobleman  contrived to keep the death of Edward VI. a secret two days, and  secure from the Mayor and Alderman of London a promise to respect the  will of the late king. In consequence, the Lady Jane Grey was  proclaimed Queen of England. \"So far was she from any desire of this  advancement, that she began to act her part of royalty with many  tears, thus plainly showing to those who had access to her, that she  was forced by her relations and friends to this high, but dangerous  post.\" She was accomplished, beautiful, and amiable, devoted to her  young husband, and very fond of Plato, whom she read in the original.    [Sidenote: Execution of Northumberland.]    But Mary's friends exerted themselves, and her cause--the cause of  legitimacy, rather than that of Catholicism--gained ground.  Northumberland was unequal to this crisis, and he was very feebly  sustained. His forces were suppressed, his schemes failed, and his  hopes fled. From rebellion, to the scaffold, there is but a step; and  this great nobleman suffered the fate of Somerset, his former rival.  His execution confirms one of the most striking facts in the history  of absolute"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#17)"],[1,"for sale. The king had a  minister, named Moon, who could not restrain his curiosity; and he  peeped at her from a balcony. The princess, as he did so, caught sight  of him and made signs to him, which were interpreted by the penetration  of his wife to be an invitation to meet her clandestinely. The wife  hardly displayed what most ladies would deem \"a proper spirit\" in  advising compliance; and the consequence of taking that advice would  have been serious trouble both to himself and to the princess, had it  not been for the ready wit of the two women, who got over the difficulty  by contriving an ingenious equivocation not unknown in other stories, by  which the princess cleared herself and her lover on oath.[52]    It is true that in these tales the lady who rides forth is not naked;  but to ride openly and unveiled would be thought almost as immodest in  countries where strict seclusion is imposed upon women. All these tales  include the Peeping Tom incident; and it appears, indeed, so obvious a  corollary to the central thought of Lady Godiva's adventure that it is  hardly likely to have required centuries for its evolution. From some  traditions, however, it is absent. A story belonging to the Cinderella  cycle, found at Smyrna, relates that when a certain king desired to  marry his own daughter, the maiden, by the advice of her Fate, demanded  as the price of compliance three magnificent dresses. Having obtained  these, she asked permission to go unseen (like Badroulbadour) to the  bath. The king, to gratify her, forbade his subjects on pain of death to  open their shops or to show themselves in the streets while she passed  by. She thus got an opportunity of escaping from the city, of which she  did not fail to make use,--greatly, no doubt, to her unnatural father's  disgust. An Indian tradition also tells us that the inhabitants of  Chamba were under the necessity of digging a canal for irrigation, but  when it was dug, owing to the enchantments of an evil spirit, not a  drop of water could be got to flow along its course. A magician at last  found out that the spell could be dissolved if the beautiful and  virtuous young princess of Chamba would consent to traverse a given  distance of the plain entirely naked, in full view of the populace, and  to lose her head when the journey was accomplished. After much  hesitation, her compassion triumphed over her shame; and she undertook  the task. But lo! as she advanced, a thick line of young trees arose to  right and left, completely hiding her from cynical eyes. And the shady  canal is shown to-day by the good people of Chamba as one of the most  authentic monuments of their history.[53]    So far the stories. Concerning which it must be observed that they are  evidence that the myth of Lady Godiva is widely diffused in the East,  and that the spy is usually, though not always, part of the tale. The  Smyrnoean version must probably be thrown out of the reckoning. It is, as  I have already mentioned, a variant of the Cinderella cycle. The problem  of the plot is how to get the heroine unseen out of her father's  clutches. This is commonly effected by the simple mechanism of a  disguise and a night escape. Other methods, I need not now detail, are,  however, sometimes adopted; and the excuse of going to the bath, with  the order to the people to close their shops and keep within doors,  would seem to reveal nothing more than the unconscious influence of  Aladdin or some other of the Eastern stories. Throwing this out, then,  as accidental, an overwhelming proportion of the analogues cited  contains the spy. It would be dangerous to reason on the supposition  that the proportions of all the Asiatic variants extant correspond with  those of the variants cited; but we are at liberty to assume that a  large number, if not the majority, comprise the incident of Peeping  Tom. None of them was known in Europe until Galland published his  translation of the \"Arabian Nights\" in the year 1704--upwards of two  centuries later than the latest period at which the story as given in  the Coventry manuscript can have come into existence.    But the stories, though they may go a little way to help us in regard to  the incident of Peeping Tom, throw no light on the origin of the legend,  or of the procession. Let us therefore turn to one or two curious  religious ceremonies, which may have some bearing upon it. A potent  spell to bring rain was reported as actually practised during the  Gorakhpur famine of 1873-4. It consisted of a gang of women stripping  themselves perfectly naked, and going out by night to drag the plough  across a field. The men were kept carefully out of the way, as it was  believed that peeping by them would not only vitiate the spell, but  bring trouble on the village. It would not be a long step from this  belief to a story in which peeping was alleged to have taken place with  disastrous effects, either to the village, or (by favour of the deities  intended to be propitiated) to the culprit himself. At the festival of  the local goddess in the village of Serur, in the Southern Mahratta  country, the third and fourth days are devoted to private offerings.  Many women, we are told, on these days walk naked to the temple in  fulfilment of vows, \"but they were covered with leaves and boughs of  trees, and surrounded by their female relations and friends.\"[54]    The performance of religious rites by women alone, when men are required  under heavy penalties to absent themselves, is, indeed, not very  uncommon in savage life. Nor is it confined to savage life. When Rome  was at the height of her civilization and her triumphs, the festival of  the Bona Dea was rendered notorious by the divorce of Caesar's wife and  by legal proceedings against an aristocratic scoundrel, who, for the  purposes of an intrigue with her, had violated the sacred ceremonies.  The Bona Dea, or Good Goddess, was a woodland deity, the daughter and  wife of Faunus. Her worship had descended from a remote antiquity; and  her annual festival was held in the month of December, and was attended  only by women. The matrons of the noblest families of Rome met by night  in the house of the highest official of the state to perform the  traditional ceremonies of the goddess, and to pray for the well-being of  the Roman people. Only women, and those of the most unsullied character,  were permitted to attend; and the breach of this rule by Clodius,  disguised in woman's garb, constituted a heinous offence against the  state, from the penalties of which he only escaped, if we may believe  Cicero, by bribing the judges.[55]    At the village of Southam, not far from Coventry, another procession in  honour of Godiva formerly took place. Very little is known about it now,  save one singular fact, namely, that there were two Godivas in the  cavalcade, and one of them was black. Southam was part of the property  possessed by Earl Leofric; and it has been suggested that this is enough  to account for the commemoration of Godgifu. It would no doubt be an  excellent reason for affixing her renowned name to a periodical ceremony  already performed there. But it would hardly be a reason for  commemorating her extortion of privileges in which the inhabitants of  Southam did not share; and it would leave the black lady unexplained.  She may, indeed, have been a mere travesty, though the hypothesis would  be anything but free from difficulty. Here, again, if we have recourse  to the comparison of ceremonies, we may obtain some light. Among the  tribes of the Gold Coast of Africa the wives of men who have gone to war  make a daily procession through the town. They are stark naked, painted  all over with white, and decorated with beads and charms. Any man who is  found in the town is attacked and driven away. And on the occasion of a  battle the women imitate the actions the men are thought to be  performing, with guns, sticks, and knives. The Gold Coast is a long way  off; but not only do black women there paint themselves white in their  sacred rites, white women in Britain have painted themselves, if not  black, at least a dark blue. Pliny records that both matrons and  unmarried girls among the Britons in the first century of the Christian  era were in the habit of staining themselves all over with the juice of  the woad; and he adds that, thus rivalling the swarthy hue of the  AEthiopians, they go on these occasions in a state of nature. We are  sometimes taught that when the English invaded Britain, the natives whom  they found here were all driven out or massacred. There are, however,  many reasons for doubting that this wholesale destruction was as  complete as has been imagined. The name of Coventry betrays in its  termination a Celtic element; and this could hardly have entered into it  had there not been in the neighbourhood a considerable British-speaking  population. What is more likely than that at Southam this population  continued and preserved its customs, and that one of such customs was  that very religious rite of which Pliny speaks? Unhappily he tells us  nothing about the rite itself, nor the deity in whose honour it was  performed. But it would not involve a great stretch of fancy to suppose  that in the black lady of Southam we have a survival of the performance.  It is not too much to say that this explanation would have the merit of  being intelligible and adequate.[56]    In all countries ceremonies of a special character are usually dramatic.  They represent, or are believed to represent, actions of the divinities  in whose honour they are performed. The rites of the Bona Dea, we know,  were of this kind; and they consequently degenerated into orgies of a  shameful character. The Coventry procession is admittedly a  representation of Godgifu's ride. It is not now, nor has it been so long  as we have any records of it--that is to say for two hundred  years--connected with any"]]]
