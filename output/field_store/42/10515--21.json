[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19767"],[0,"George Borrow and His Circle (#17)"],[1,"       'I was at school with Borrow at the Free School, Norwich, under       the Rev. E. Valpy. He was an odd, wild boy, and always wanting       to turn Robinson Crusoe or Buccaneer. My brother John was about       Borrow's age, and on one occasion Borrow, John, and another,       whose name I forget, determined to run away and turn pirates.       John carried an old horse pistol and some potatoes as his       contribution to the general stock, but his zeal was soon       exhausted, he turned back at Thorpe Lunatic Asylum; but Borrow       went off to Yarmouth, and lived on the Caister Denes for a few       days. I don't remember hearing of any exploits. He had a       wonderful facility for learning languages, which, however, he       never appears to have turned to account.    James Martineau, afterwards a popular preacher and a distinguished  theologian of the Unitarian creed, here comes into the story. He was a  contemporary with Borrow at the Norwich Grammar School as already  stated, but the two boys had little in common. There was nothing of the  vagabond about James Martineau, and concerning Borrow--if on no other  subject--he would probably have agreed with his sister Harriet, whose  views we shall quote in a later chapter. In Martineau's _Memoirs_,  voluminous and dull, there is only one reference to Borrow;[41] but a  correspondent once ventured to approach the eminent divine concerning  the rumour as to Martineau's part in the birching of the author of _The  Bible in Spain_, and received the following letter:                    35 GORDON SQUARE, LONDON, W.C., _December 6, 1895._         DEAR SIR,--Two or three years ago Mr. Egmont Hake (author, I       think, of a life of Gordon) sought an interview with me, as       reputed to be Borrow's sole surviving schoolfellow, in order to       gather information or test traditions about his schooldays.       This was with a view to a memoir which he was compiling, he       said, out of the literary remains which had been committed to       him by his executors. I communicated to him such recollections       as I could clearly depend upon and leave at his disposal for       publication or for suppression as he might think fit. Under       these circumstances I feel that they are rightfully his, and       that I am restrained from placing them at disposal elsewhere       unless and until he renounces his claim upon them. But though I       cannot repeat them at length for public use, I am not precluded       from correcting inaccuracies in stories already in circulation,       and may therefore say that Mr. Arthur Dalrymple's version of       the Yarmouth escapade is wrong in making his brother John a       partner in the transaction. John had quite too much sense for       that; the only victims of Borrow's romance were two or three       silly boys--mere lackeys of Borrow's commanding will--who       helped him to make up a kit for the common knapsack by       pilferings out of their fathers' shops.         The Norwich gentleman who fell in with the boys lying in the       hedgerow near the half-way inn knew one of them, and wormed out       of him the drift of their enterprise, and engaging a postchaise       packed them all into it, and in his gig saw them safe home.         It is true that I had to _hoist_ (not 'horse') Borrow for his       flogging, but not that there was anything exceptional or       capable of leaving permanent scars in the infliction. Mr. Valpy       was not given to excess of that kind.         I have never read _Lavengro_, and cannot give any opinion about       the correct spelling of the 'Exul sacerdos' name.         Borrow's romance and William Taylor's love of paradox would       doubtless often run together, like a pair of well-matched       steeds, and carry them away in the same direction. But there       was a strong--almost wild--_religious_ sentiment in Borrow, of       which only faint traces appear in W. T. In Borrow it had always       a tendency to pass from a sympathetic to an antipathetic form.       He used to gather about him three or four favourite       schoolfellows, after they had learned their class lesson and       before the class was called up, and with a sheet of paper and       book on his knee, invent and tell a story, making rapid little       pictures of each _dramatis persona_ that came upon the stage.       The plot was woven and spread out with much ingenuity, and the       characters were various and well discriminated. But two of       them were sure to turn up in every tale, the Devil and the       Pope, and the working of the drama invariably had the same       issue--the utter ruin and disgrace of these two potentates. I       had often thought that there was a presage here of the mission       which produced _The Bible in Spain_.--I am, dear sir, very       truly yours,                    JAMES MARTINEAU.[42]    Yet it is amusing to trace the story through various phases. Dr.  Martineau's letter was the outcome of his attention being called to a  statement made in a letter written by a lady in Hampstead to a friend in  Norwich, which runs as follows:                    _11th Nov. 1893._         Dr. Martineau, to amuse some boys at a school treat, told us       about George Borrow, his schoolfellow: he was always reading       adventures of smugglers and pirates, etc., and at last, to       carry out his ideas, got a set of his schoolfellows to promise       to join him in an expedition to Yarmouth, where he had heard of       a ship that he thought would take them. The boys saved all the       food they could from their meals, and what money they had, and       one morning started very early to walk to Yarmouth. They got       half-way--to Blofield, I think--when they were so tired they       had to rest by the roadside, and eat their lunch. While they       were resting, a gentleman, whose son was at the Free School,       passed in his gig. He thought it was very odd so many boys,       some of whom he had seen, should be waiting about, so he drove       back and asked them if they would come to dine with him at the       inn. Of course they were only too glad, poor boys: but as soon       as he had got them all in he sent his servant with a letter to       Mr. Valpy, who sent a coach and brought them all back. You know       what a cruel man that Dr. V. was. He made Dr. Martineau take       poor Borrow on his back, 'horse him,' I think he called it, and       flogged him so that Dr. M. said he would carry the marks for       the rest of his life, and he had to keep his bed for a       fortnight. The other boys got off with lighter punishment, but       Borrow was the ring-leader. Those were the 'good old times'! I       have heard Dr. M. say that not for another life would he go       through the misery he suffered as 'town boy' at that school.    Miss Frances Power Cobbe, who lived next door to Borrow in Hereford  Square, Brompton, in the 'sixties, as we shall see later, has a word to  say on the point:         Dr. Martineau once told me that he and Borrow had been       schoolfellows at Norwich some sixty years before. Borrow had       persuaded several of his other companions to rob their fathers'       tills, and then the party set forth to join some smugglers on       the coast. By degrees the truants all fell out of line and were       picked up, tired and hungry, along the road, and brought back       to Norwich School, where condign chastisement awaited them.       George Borrow, it seems, received his large share _horsed_ on       James Martineau's back! The early connection between the two       old men, as I knew them, was irresistibly comic to my mind.       Somehow when I asked Mr. Borrow once to come and meet some       friends at our house he accepted our invitation as usual, but,       on finding that Dr. Martineau was to be of the party, hastily       withdrew his acceptance on a transparent excuse; nor did he       ever after attend our little assemblies without first       ascertaining that Dr. Martineau was not to be present.[43]    James Martineau died in 1900, but the last of Borrow's schoolfellows to  die was, I think, Mr. William Edmund Image, a Justice of the Peace and  Deputy Lieutenant for Suffolk. He resided at Herringswell House, near  Mildenhall, where he died in 1903, aged 96 years.    Mr. Valpy of the Norwich Grammar School is scarcely to be blamed that he  was not able to make separate rules for a quite abnormal boy. Yet, if  he could have known, Borrow was better employed playing truant and  living up to his life-work as a glorified vagabond than in studying in  the ordinary school routine. George Borrow belonged to a type of  boy--there are many such--who learn much more out of school than in its  bounds; and the boy Borrow, picking up brother vagabonds in Tombland  Fair, and already beginning, in his own peculiar way, his language  craze, was laying the foundations that made _Lavengro_ possible.

The Cripple hied him to the store, and  after breaking down the door abstracted the only blacking-brush in the  camp,--putting down a sovereign on the counter in exchange for it,--and  set to polishing his high boots as if a fortune depended on their  brightness. The Scholar bought Herr Gustav's white shirt for a fiver,  threatening to murder its owner if he did not render it up. And  Partridge, a good man from Norfolk, with a regrettable weakness for  shooting other people's game, induced a friend to denude him of his  flowing locks by means of a clasp-knife and a hunk of wood, as no  scissors were procurable.    The wardrobes of Big Stone Hole were stocked more with a view to strict  utility than variety or ornamentation, and the slender resources of the  store utterly gave out under the sudden strain that was put upon them.  In every direction grimy, unkempt men might be seen attempting to  beautify themselves. Here was one enduring agonies from a razor that  would scarcely whittle a stick; here another recalling the feel of a  cake of soap; there a great fellow pulling faces as he struggled to get  the teeth of a comb into his shock of hair; there another brushing the  clay from his moleskin trousers with a tuft of stiff grass.    It seemed to these men ages since they had last seen a woman in  the flesh,--Kaffir women don't count; they are not women, merely  Kaffirs,--and, with the natural instinct of males of every species, they  set about pluming their feathers.    These operations, though speedy as might be, were necessarily prolonged,  for most of the men required several buckets of water over the head  before they felt fit for such unaccustomed exercises, and they were  scarcely finished before the creaking of wheels and the cries of the  voorlooper as he urged his oxen announced that the wagon was within  earshot. Up it came, the great tilt gleaming white in the moonlight, and  every eye was fixed expectantly on the dark chasm within. The driver,  puffed up with his own importance, cracked his long whip and deigned not  to notice the men whom he usually greeted with a friendly hail, and the  Hottentot boy ahead, imitating his master, vouchsafed no explanation.  With more deathly slowness than usual did the lumbering vehicle crawl  along until the tired cattle pulled up before the door of the American  Bar. Then there was a rush and a bit of a scuffle for the honour of  handing the woman out. The Cripple was the fortunate man, and, after  assisting her to the ground, waved his tattered hat toward the gleaming  open doorway. But he did not speak. Words were beyond him. Indeed, the  diggers, who were none of them particularly remarkable for taciturnity  as a general thing, seemed, with one exception, to be stricken dumb.  But the Scholar proved himself equal to the occasion, and with courtly  phrase bade the new-comer welcome to the camp. He had always been a  popular man among women in his palmier days, though openly holding  rather a poor opinion of them; and as the one before him now was neat  of speech and comely of form, he was not at all averse to enjoying her  society and conversation.    \"I should be much obliged if you would direct me to a hotel,\" she said,  after taking a look around the cheap gaudiness of the saloon.    \"I'm sorry to say that we have no hotel here as yet, Miss--er--?\"    \"Musgrave. Miss Mary Musgrave\"--with a little bow. \"But I heard that a  German had started a hotel here.\"    \"No; there is nothing but this. That\"--pointing to Herr Gustave, who was  regarding the newcomer with an evil eye--\"that is the German.\"    Miss Musgrave appeared distressed.    \"Then where can I go?\" she asked. \"Are there any lodgings to be had?\"    \"The lady may have my place,\" chorused three eager voices, and every man  in the room repeated the offer.    She thanked them with a pretty smile and one comprehensive bow, and  looked up at the Scholar for help.    \"I would offer you my hut if it were not such a wretched one. But, as  it is, I should advise you to take this man's\"--and he pointed to Tommy  Dartmoor.    \"Why, mine's twenty carats better than hisn!\" exclaimed the Cripple.    \"And mine better 'n either,\" growled Dan.    \"Mine's the best of the lot.\"    \"No, it isn't; mine is,\" yelled others, till there was a general roar,  which caused Miss Musgrave to look frightened and shrink nearer to the  Scholar, and that gentleman to raise his hand for silence.    \"Look here,\" said he, \"we'll pick out the twelve best, and their owners  can cut with one another from a pack of cards.\"    After some discussion twelve were settled upon, but the number was  immediately raised to thirteen to prevent Jockey Bill disgracing the  camp by shooting before a lady. A pack of cards was placed on the bar,  and each man chose one, holding his selection face downward till all  were ready. Then the Scholar said, \"Turn,\" and there were exhibited five  aces, two kings, a queen, three knaves, and two smaller cards. This was  awkward, to say the least of it, and, while sarcastic laughter rippled  among the spectators, there was an instinctive movement of right hands  toward the back of the belt on the part of each of the thirteen.    But the Scholar's voice, full of remonstrance, said, \"Boys, you're being  looked at,\" and there was a regretful sigh or two, but no bloodshed.    Miss Musgrave gazed inquiringly from one to another, and the Scholar,  laying his hand on her arm, whispered something in her ear. She smiled,  whispered back, and was answered, and then, stripping off a pair of  well-fitting fawn gloves, she took the cards in a pretty little white  hand, and dealt out one to each of the competitors with charming  clumsiness.    \"Ain't touched a keard afore, bless her,\" whispered Euchre Buck, giving  his neighbor Dan a nudge in the ribs to call attention to this wonderful  piece of girlish innocence. \"Square a deal es George Washington mought  ha' made.\" Then, as the greasy pasteboards were turned up, and his  neighbour was handed the ace of clubs, he raised his voice and yelled  out, \"Bully for you, Dan! Cut away an' clar yer cabin out.\"    Away scampered Dan out into the darkness, with the rest of the crew at  his heels. Their home comforts were very small, poor fellows; but each  gave of his best, though the gifts were often incongruous enough.  In half an hour the cabin was fitted out with a small cracked  looking-glass, two combs, an old hair-brush,--still wet from the  wash,--a pail, a frying-pan, three kettles, two three-legged stools, and  so many blankets that some were requisitioned to carpet the floor. The  whole crowd accompanied Miss Musgrave to her door and gave her a  cheer by way of good-night. She bowed to them, smiling her thanks, and  looking, as they thought, entrancingly lovely as she stood there, with  the pale moonbeams falling full on her.    Then she turned to go in, but as Euchre Buck stepped forward with an  admonishing cough, she waited and looked round at him.    \"Miss,\" said he, holding out a big revolver in his hard fist, \"you take  this yer gun, an' ef any one whistles, or otherwise disturbs you, let a  hole into him straight away, an' we'll see him buried decent.\"    But Miss Musgrave courteously, and with profuse thanks, refused the  offer, and, saying that she had perfect confidence in all who were  around her, gave Euchre Buck a bewitching smile, went inside, and closed  the door after he.    Then the diggers returned to Gustav Werstein's American Bar and  discussed the new arrival.    \"I known Noomarket an' Hascot an' Hepson, an' all the places where  swells goes in England,\" said Jockey Bill, enthusiastically; \"but never  one come there as pretty as she, stop my license if ther' did.\"    \"Grand eyes, hain't she?\" said Tommy Dartmoor. \"Regular fust-water 'uns.  Here's to 'em!\"    \"And-a-hoof! See it peep below her gownd. S' welp me ef it wer' es big  as my 'bacca-box!\"    \"An' 'er close, gentlemen! Made to measure, every thread on 'em, I  allow.\"    \"She's a lady, boys,\" exclaimed he who had offered to see after a  funeral, \"a reg'lar slap-up, high-toned, blow-yer-eyes-don't-touch-me  lady; an' as she sees fit to do the civil to this fellar\"--striking  himself on the chest--\"he's just going to drop his professional name,  an' arsk yer to call him Mister Samuel K. Gregson, Esquire. Play on  that.\"    Next morning the inhabitants of Big Stone Hole were startled by reading  this announcement outside the cabin which Dan had resigned to Miss  Musgrave:         SINGING AND MUSIC TAUGHT.       LITERARY WORK DONE.    It was printed on a card, which was affixed to the door by means of a  drawing-pin, and from within came the sound of a contralto voice singing  to a guitar accompaniment. One by one the male residents of Big Stone  Hole drew near to that iron-roofed hut and stopped to listen; but after  commenting on the innovation in gleeful whispers--for guitar had never  twanged in that part of Africa before--they moved on to their work. No  consideration could cause them to neglect that. They might fritter away  the dull, rough gems when they had found them, but the lust of handling  diamonds once was the strongest passion they knew. And so the day's  toil was not curtailed; but at the conclusion Miss Musgrave had an  application for instruction in music from every man in the camp, with  one exception. This one defaulter was Euchre Buck. He owned to having  no ear for music--thereby exhibiting more honesty than many of the  others--and confessed to knowing only two tunes, one of which was  \"Hail Columbia,\" and the other--wasn't; and so he said he wanted some  \"literary work done.\" He proposed to Miss Musgrave that she should write  a history of his life at half a guinea a page, thereby--cute Yankee that  he was--thinking to appropriate the whole of her time.    But embarrassed by all these calls upon her, and"]]]
