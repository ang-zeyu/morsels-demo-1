NO. 55. HIPPOSIDEROS SPEORIS.  _The Indian Horse-shoe Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 26_).    HABITAT.--India generally and Ceylon.    DESCRIPTION.--Mouse brown or fulvous brown. Occasionally golden  fulvous and sometimes dusky black above, paler beneath; membranes  dusky brown; interfemoral membrane narrow, enclosing the tail except  the last half joint (about 2-10ths of an inch), which is free.    Ear large, erect and pointed, rounded at the base and emarginated  on the outer edge; nasal process complicated. \"Males have a frontal  sac; females none\" (_Kellaart_). Pubis naked, with two inguinal  warts.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2 inches; tail, 1-2/10; wing expanse, 12.    Inhabits old buildings, wells, &c.      NO. 56. HIPPOSIDEROS MURINUS.  _The Little Horse-shoe Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 27_).    HABITAT.--Southern India, Ceylon, and Burmah.    DESCRIPTION.--Muzzle short; body short and thick; a transverse  frontal leaf with a sac behind it; no folds of skin on each side of  the horse-shoe as in the last species; ears large, naked and rounded;  colour dusky brown or mouse, sometimes light fawn; wing membrane  blackish; interfemoral membrane large, and including the tail all  but the tip.    SIZE.--Head and body, 1-4/5 inch; tail, 1-1/5 inch; wing expanse,  10.    Jerdon says the mouse-coloured variety is common in the Carnatic,  but he has only seen the light fulvous race on the Nilgheries; but  Mr. Elliot procured both in the southern Mahratta country. A dark  variety of this bat was called _Rhinolophus ater_ by Templeton, and  _H. atratus_ by Kellaart; in other respects it is identical, only  a little smaller.      NO. 57. HIPPOSIDEROS CINERACEUS.  _The Ashy Horse-shoe Bat_ (_Jerdon's No. 28_).    HABITAT.--Punjab Salt range.    DESCRIPTION.--Similar to the last, but larger, and I should think  the argument against _H. atratus_ would apply to this as a distinct  species.      NO. 58. HIPPOSIDEROS LARVATUS.  _Syn_.--PHYLLORHINA LARVATA.    HABITAT.--Arracan.    DESCRIPTION.--The fur of the upper part bright fulvous; more or less  tinged with maroon on the back, lighter underneath; membranes dusky,  but tinged with the prevailing colour of the fur; ears angulated;  a minute false molar in front of the carnassial in the upper jaw.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2-3/4 inches; tail, 1-1/4; wing extent, 12.    Kellaart writes of this bat under his _H. aureus_. He describes it  as head, neck, and body of a bright golden yellow, with a slight  maroon shade on the tips of the hairs on the back. Females paler  coloured. Frontal sac only in males; the waxy matter of a yellow  colour, and quite transparent.      NO. 59. HIPPOSIDEROS VULGARIS.  _Syn_.--PHYLLORHINA LARVATA.  _The Common Malayan Horse-shoe Bat_.    HABITAT.--Arracan and Malayana.    DESCRIPTION.--\"It differs from the last in being rather smaller, and  of a brown colour above, much paler at the base of the hairs and at  their extreme tips, and lighter coloured below; the ears more  apiculated, or rather they appear so from being strongly emarginated  externally towards the tip.\"--_Blyth_.    SIZE.--2-3/10 inches; tail 1-2/10; wing expanse about 12.      NO. 60. HIPPOSIDEROS BLYTHII.    HABITAT.--Ceylon, Fort Frederic.    DESCRIPTION.--Above surface colour a rich dark tawny brown; base of  hairs much lighter coloured, of a brighter yellow tinge; beneath  paler; face partially blackish; ears black; tip of tail excerted;  no frontal sac; membranes blackish; nasal processes as in _H.  speoris_.    SIZE.--Head and body, 2-2/10 inches; tail, 1; wing expanse, 12.    Dr. Kellaart considered this a new and undescribed species,  distinguished from _H. speoris_ and _H. vulgaris_ (_vel  Templetonii_--Kellaart) by the greater length of the fore-arm, which  is two inches. This remark however does not apply to _vulgaris_, of  which Kellaart himself gives two inches as the length of the radius,  and Blyth gives two and a quarter. The absence of the frontal sac  would have been a greater proof, but both specimens on which Kellaart  made his observations were females; and as colouring is so varied  in the bat tribe as to preclude the division of species on this ground,  I think we may put this down as a doubtful species on which more  information is desirable.      NO. 61. PHYLLORHINA DIADEMA.    HABITAT.--India generally; Ceylon and Burmah.    DESCRIPTION.--The fur with three shades--buff, then reddish brown  with ashy tips, underneath greyish or pale brown. \"The hinder erect  nose-leaf,\" according to Dobson's description, \"equals the  horse-shoe and slightly exceeds the sella in width, its free margin  forming a segment of the circumference of a circle, with a small blunt  projection in the centre and three vertical ridges on its concave  front surface; sella large, with a prominent ridge in the centre,  forming a small projection above and one smaller on each side; sides  of the muzzle with prominent vertical leaves, three on each side;  no frontal pore.\"    There is a good figure of the head of this bat in Cuvier's 'Animal  Kingdom,' Carpenter's and Westwood's edition, under the name of  _Rhinolophus nobilis_. It is the same also as Kellaart's  _Hipposideros lankadiva_. Captain Hutton, who was a keen observer  of the habits of the bats at Mussoorie, says of this one: \"Like _R.  affinis_, this species may frequently be heard during its flight  cracking and crunching the hard wings of beetles, which in the  evening hours are usually abundant among the trees; the teeth are  strong, and the _tout ensemble_ of its aspect is not unlike that of  a bull-dog.\"--'Proc. Zoo. Soc.,' 1872, page 701.      NO. 62. PHYLLORHINA MASONI.    HABITAT.--Burmah (Moulmein).    DESCRIPTION.--This bat resembles the last closely; such difference  as exists is that the concave surface of the terminal nose-leaf is  divided into two cells only by a single central vertical ridge, and  from the under surface of the juncture of the mandible a small bony  process projects downwards about equal to the lower canine tooth in  vertical extent, and covered by the integument.    There is an excellent figure of this bat in Dobson's Monograph, from  whence I have also taken the above description.      NO. 63. PHYLLORHINA NICOBARENSIS.    HABITAT.--Nicobar Island.    DESCRIPTION.--\"Ears large, acute; outer margin slightly concave  beneath the tip; no frontal sac behind the nose-leaf; upper margin  of the transverse terminal leaf simple, forming an arc of a circle,  folded back and overhanging the concave front surface, which is  divided into _two_ cells only by a single central longitudinal ridge;  in front the margin of the horse-shoe is marked by three small points\"  (_Dobson_). Fur light brown, then greyish, with light brown tips.    SIZE.--Length of head and body, 3 inches.      NO. 64. PHYLLORHINA ARMIGERA.    HABITAT.--The entire range of the Himalayas, Khasya Hills, and  Ceylon.    [Figure: _Phyllorhina armigera_.  Male. Female.]    DESCRIPTION.--The hinder erect nose-leaf narrow, not so broad as the  horse-shoe; upper edge sinuate, slightly elevated in the centre, and  at either extremity; vertical ridges beneath well developed,  prominent, enclosing moderately deep cells; wart-like granular  elevations on each side above the eyes are usually greatly developed,  forming large thickened longitudinal elevations extending forward  on each side of the posterior erect nose-leaf, and backwards towards  the frontal sac (_Dobson_). The colour varies.    SIZE.--Length of head and body from 3 to 4 inches; tail about 2.    This is the largest of this genus, and one of the most interesting  of the species. My space will not admit of extensive quotations from  those who have written about it, but there is a fuller description  of it in Dr. Dobson's book, and a very interesting account of its  habits by Capt. J. Hutton, in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological  Society,' 1872, page 701.      NO. 65. PHYLLORHINA LEPTOPHYLLA.    HABITAT.--Khasya Hills.    DESCRIPTION.--Ears large, broad, triangular, with subacute tips;  outer margin slightly concave; upper transverse nose-leaf small;  upper edge simple, narrower than horse-shoe, thin; three vertical  folds in front faintly descernible at base only; horse-shoe with  small incision in centre of front free edge; frontal pore small,  placed at some distance behind the transverse nose-leaf; fur and  integuments dark throughout.--_Dobson_.    SIZE.--Length of head and body, 2 inches; tail, 1-6/10.      NO. 66. PHYLLORHINA GALERITA.    HABITAT.--Central India, Deccan.    DESCRIPTION.--\"Ear comparatively small, as broad as long; inner  margin very convex forward; outer margin slightly concave beneath  the tip; nose-leaf as in _P. larvata_, but the transverse terminal  leaf is more rectangular; the superior margin less convex, and its  concave front surface is marked by three very prominent vertical  ridges; frontal pore small, indistinct, not larger than in the  females of _P. larvata_.\"--_Dobson_.    SIZE.--Head and body about 2 inches; tail, 1 inch.      NO. 67. PHYLLORHINA BICOLOR.    HABITAT.--India (N. W. Himalaya), Nicobar Islands.    DESCRIPTION.--Fur above reddish chestnut; the base of the hairs pale  reddish-white, or base of hair pure white, the tip, dark  reddish-brown. Ears as long as the head, broad; the lower half of  the inner margin very convex; the summit of the ear conch rounded  off broadly as far as a point on the outer side, where a slight but  distinct flattening occurs, and indicates the position of the tip.

And here is a little rule of thumb we want you to bear constantly in  mind while you are having rapid fire: Load your piece quickly, but aim  and squeeze your trigger deliberately. Keep cool.    The best shot in the company is the man who practises the most.          CHAPTER X    PRACTICE MARCH OR \"HIKE\"        The manoeuver practice march will be the most instructive, the most  pleasant, and one of the hardest periods of your service. You will  return from it proud of the hardships you have undergone and capable of  speaking with authority on many practical matters pertaining to  soldiering. You will be able to amuse yourself and your friends with  reminiscences of the many incidents which you will never forget. It is  during the practice march that you will put into practical use the  tactical principles and battle formations of which, up to that time, you  will have heard at lectures, or which you will have executed in a  mechanical manner at drill. You will return from each march with a  knowledge of many practical points on camp sanitation, of the pleasures  and hardships incident to manoeuver warfare, and of the manner in which a  soldier adapts himself to changing conditions, all of which cannot be  learned from books or lectures.    The practice march demands a large expenditure of physical and mental  energy; however, the hardships are greatly exaggerated by the old  soldiers. To make up a set of equipment, to assist in cleaning up camp  and loading trucks, to march and fight for a distance of ten or twelve  miles while carrying a heavy pack on the back and a nine-pound gun on  the shoulder, and upon reaching camp to pitch your tent, make up your  bed, do some fatigue work, and probably some guard duty in addition, all  in one day, is a hard physical strain on the average man. By obeying  implicitly the advice of your company commander, you will greatly lessen  the hardships incident to a practice march, and by disobeying it you  may possibly undergo the mortification of having to drop out of ranks  and be jeered at by the passing column. The following suggestions, if  followed implicitly, will lessen the hardship of the \"hike.\"        MARCHING RULES      1. Adjust your equipment, if necessary, at the first halt.    2. Do not leave the column without the express permission of your  company company commander.    3. Keep in your proper place in the column.    4. keep forty inches from the man in front of you.        HALTS      Halts are made for the purpose of resting. Take advantage of the  opportunity by sitting down at once along the side of the road near the  place where your squad will form when the march is resumed. Remain  seated until the command to fall in is given.    Sit down in such a way that you do not support the weight of the pack on  your shoulders while resting. Don't go wandering off into people's  yards or orchards. Relax as completely as possible. Get into place  immediately when the signal is given.        CAMPING      Two men tent together--the front rank man and his rear rank file. Alter  pitching your tent, get inside and level off the ground. Cut a drain  around the tent to carry the water off; this should be done even in  pleasant weather. In case you do not trench your tent and a sudden rain  comes, your blankets may get wet and you will probably lose some  much-needed rest and sleep. If the tent pins will not stay in the  ground, cut some small sticks to a length of about twelve inches and use  them as tent pins.        PREPARING YOUR BED      After you have pitched your tent, get some hay, grass, straw, or leaves  and cover the floor. Place one poncho on this, then one or two blankets  on top of the poncho to sleep on, and use the remaining blankets as  cover. Spread the other poncho over the tent. Many men are careless  about making a comfortable bed. You will be rewarded with large  dividends if you are zealous in making yourself comfortable. Arrange  your equipment at the rear just under the small triangle. Get your meat  can, knife, fork, spoon, and tin cup out where they will be handy.        MAKING UP YOUR PACK      Immediately after reveille, take down your tent and make up your pack.  Place your extra blankets on the pile with those of the other members of  your squad. Make up your surplus kit bundle and put it in the surplus  kit bag.        WATER      Fill your canteen each evening, as the water wagons sometimes do not  reach camp before the morning march is commenced. Excessive water  drinking on the march is the besetting sin of the inexperienced soldier.  One swallow of water calls for another. Soon your canteen is empty. Your  stomach feels uncomfortable. You are still thirsty. If it is necessary  to replace some of the water of the body which is lost by perspiration,  and this is often necessary, first gargle out the mouth and throat and  spit the water out; then take a swallow or two, but be careful not to  drink to excess. Injudicious and excessive water drinking fills the  hospital ambulances and auto trucks with men who should be in ranks. One  half a canteen of water is sufficient for you on any march you will have  to make. After you arrive in camp and have cooled off a little, drink as  much water as you desire, but do so slowly.        CARE OF THE FEET      The infantryman's feet are his means of transportation. If you care for  them properly, you will be rewarded.    1. Wash and dry the feet carefully and put on clean socks as soon as  practicable after getting into camp.    2. Wash out the socks you have been wearing and hang them out to dry.    3. Do not wear socks with holes in them if you can possibly avoid it.  Should a hole begin to cause rubbing, turn the sock inside out or change  it to the other foot.    4. Just as soon as you decide to attend a training camp or join the  colors, cut your toe nails square across the ends so they will not grow  in.    5. In case of any foot trouble that you cannot relieve, report to the  surgeon at once. Don't wait until you cannot march before reporting.    6. A Treatment for Blisters. Be careful not to tear off the skin  covering the blister. Heat the point of a needle until it is red hot and  when it cools insert it under the live skin a little distance away from  the blister. Push it through to the under side of the bruised skin or  blister and then press out the water. To protect the blister, grease a  small piece of chamois with vaseline and place it so that it covers the  blister and extends over on the solid skin surrounding it. Then place a  piece of oxide adhesive tape over the chamois. This method allows the  protective covering to be removed without rupturing the skin over the  blister and protects the new tender and sensitive skin so that the  weight can be rested upon the foot without causing severe pain. One man  in each squad should be provided with a needle, adhesive tape, a bottle  of vaseline, and a piece of chamois for the common use of the squad.    7. Shoes.        a. Be sure they fit your feet. The business shoe you wear at the      office won't do for marching when, with the additional weight you      carry, your foot spreads in breadth and extends in length; hence      your marching shoes should be longer and broader than your business      shoes. This is a very important item and should not be neglected. If      your shoes are too large, blisters will result; if too small, your      foot will be cramped, and every step will be painful.        b. Break your shoes in prior to the practice march.        c. Keep your shoes well oiled so they will be soft and pliable and      keep out water.        d. If your shoes get wet on the inside heat some small pebbles (not      so hot as to burn leather) and keep them inside the shoes until dry.        CAMP SANITATION    In camp you are really your brother's keeper. It is the duty of every  man to keep the camp clean, sanitary, and livable. Constantly bear in  mind that a great number of men are living together in a very small  area; that food is being prepared in the open; that there are no sewers;  and that the ground or dust and streams must not be polluted. Obey  conscientiously and diligently the following rules:    1. Don't take food to your tent.    2. Use the latrines that are provided.    3. When possible bathe each day as soon as practicable after you arrive  at camp.    4. Don't throw food or fruit peeling on the ground.    5. Dispose of any food you cannot eat by burning in the kitchen  incinerator.    6. Keep away from the kitchen and cooks.    7. Don't dip your cup in the drinking water receptacle. Use the dipper  provided for that purpose.    8. If sick, report to a surgeon.    9. Don't litter up the camp with paper.    10. Get your drinking water and bathe at the authorized places. The camp  commander always designates different places for cooking and drinking  water, for watering the animals, for bathing and washing clothes.    11. On leaving camp the ground should be in better condition than when  you arrived. All sinks, latrines, ditches, and holes are filled and the  earth stamped down; all combustibles that have no value should be burned  and noncombustible matter either buried or piled so it can be carted  away.    12. All deposits in the rears should be covered with earth.      MISCELLANEOUS    1. Take great pains each morning to make a neat, small and solid pack  and strap it up securely.    2. Don't put your pack on until ordered to do so by your company  commander or first sergeant.    3. Get your pack properly adjusted.    4. Don't take your equipment off during the halts allowed for resting.    5. Don't eat anything or patronize the soft drink stand during a march.    6. Retire early and get a good night's rest.    7. Use only heavy or light wool socks and see that they fit perfectly.  If you cannot wear wool socks, try cotton"]]]
