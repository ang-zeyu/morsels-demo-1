[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#17)"],[1,"book expresses it,  \"excellent bulk\"; for instance, 272 pages to an inch as against 1500 to  an inch of Oxford India paper.[3] The contrasted effects of these two  types of material upon the book as a mechanical product are well worth  the consideration of all who are engaged in the making of books.    Some of these results are surprising. What, for instance, could be more  illogical than to make a book any thicker than strength and convenience  require? Yet one has only to step out into the markets where books and  buyers meet to find a real demand for this excess of bulk. Though  illogical, the demand for size in books is profoundly psychological and  goes back to the most primitive instincts of human nature. The first of  all organs in biological development, the stomach, will not do its work  properly unless it has quantity as well as quality to deal with. So the  eye has established a certain sense of relationship between size and  value, and every publisher knows that in printing from given plates he  can get twice as much for the book at a trifling excess of cost if he  uses thicker paper and gives wider margins. That all publishers do not  follow these lines is due to the fact that other elements enter into the  total field of bookselling besides quantity, the chief of which is cost,  and another of which, growing in importance, is compactness. But it is  safe to say that to the buyer who is not, for the moment at least,  counting the cost, mere bulk makes as great an appeal as any single  element of attractiveness in the sum total of a book.    This attraction of bulk receives a striking increase if it is associated  with lightness. The customer who takes up a large book and suddenly  finds it light to hold receives a pleasurable shock which goes far  towards making him a purchaser. He seems not to ask or care whether he  may be getting few pages for his money. The presence of this single,  agreeable element of lightness at once gives a distinction to the book  that appears to supplant all other requirements. The purchaser does not  realize that the same lightness of volume associated with half the  thickness would not seem to him remarkable, though the book would take  up only half the room on his shelves. He feels that a modern miracle in  defiance of gravitation has been wrought in his favor, and he is willing  to pay for the privilege of enjoying it.    Curiously and somewhat unexpectedly the results of neither extreme,  thick paper nor thin, are wholly satisfactory in the library. The  parvenu, who is looking only to the filling up of his shelves with  volumes of impressive size, may find satisfaction in contemplating wide  backs. But the scholar and the public librarian will grudge the space  which this \"excellent bulk\" occupies. One single element in their favor  he will be quick to recognize, the better space which they afford for  distinct lettering. In a private library that is collected for use and  not for show the thin-paper books are almost an unmixed blessing. They  cost little for what they contain. Their reduction in thickness is often  associated with a reduction in height and width, so that they represent  an economy of space all round. A first-rate example of this is furnished  by the Oxford India Paper Dickens, in seventeen volumes, printed in  large type, yet, as bound, occupying a cubical space of only 13 by 7 by  4-1/2 inches and weighing only nine pounds. A more startling instance is  that of the novels of Thomas Love Peacock, which are issued in a pretty  library edition of ten volumes. But they are also issued in a _single_  volume, no higher nor wider, and only _three-fourths of an inch thick_.  But it is at this point that the public librarian rises to protest. It  is all very well, he says, for the private owner to have his literature  in this concentrated form, but for himself, how is he to satisfy the  eight readers who call for \"Headlong Hall,\" \"Nightmare Abbey,\" and the  rest of Peacock's novels all at once? To be sure he can buy and  catalogue eight single-volume sets of the author's works instead of one  set in ten volumes, and when he has done this each reader will be sure  to find the particular novel that he is looking for so long as a set  remains; but the cost will naturally be greater. On the other hand, he  welcomes equally with the private buyer the thin-paper edition of the  Shakespeare Apocrypha, which needs only a third of the shelf space  required for the regular edition, seven-sixteenths of an inch as against  an inch and five-sixteenths. He also looks upon his magazine shelves and  sees a volume of the \"Hibbert Journal\" with 966 pages in large type  occupying the space of a volume of the \"Independent\" with 1788 pages in  fine type, or again he sees by the side of his thin-paper edition of  Dickens another on heavy paper occupying more than three times the  lineal space with no advantage in clearness of type. By this time he is  ready to vote, in spite of the occasional disability of overcompactness,  for the book material that will put the least strain upon his crowded  shelves. A conference with the booksellers shows him that he is not  alone in this conclusion. Certain standard works, like the Oxford Book  of English Verse and Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, have almost ceased  to be sold in any but the thin-paper editions. Then there dawns upon him  the vision of a library in which all books that have won their way into  recognition shall be clothed in this garb of conciseness, and in which  all that aspire to that rank shall follow their example. In short he  sees what he believes to be the book of the future, which will be as  different from the book of the present as that is from the parchment  book of the early and middle ages of the Christian era, and as different  in binding as it is in material. The realization of this vision will  involve first of all a readjustment of values on the part of the  public, an outgrowing of its childish admiration for bulk. But this  change is coming so rapidly under the stress of modern conditions of  crowding, especially in city life, as to reduce the vision from its  prophetic rank to a case of mere foresight.          THE CLOTHING OF A BOOK      The binding of a book is its most conspicuous feature, the part which  forms its introduction to the public and by which too often it is judged  and valued; yet the binding is not an integral portion of the volume. It  may be changed many times without essentially changing the book; but if  the printed pages are changed, even for others identical to the eye, the  book becomes another copy. The binding is, therefore, a part of a book's  environment, though the most intimate part, like our own clothing, to  which, indeed, it bears a curious resemblance in its purpose and its  perversions.    Human clothing is for protection and adornment. That of a book involves  two other demands mutually so contradictory that bookbinding has always  offered a most attractive challenge to the skill of the handicraftsman.  The first demand is that the book when closed shall form a well-squared  and virtually solid block, like the rectangle of wood from which its  first predecessors were split, and shall be able to stand alone,  unsupported. The second demand is that this same object, when open,  shall lie flat at any point and display all its leaves in turn as fully,  and far more conveniently, than if they had never been fastened  together. Whatever may be true of other clothing, it is eminently true  of a book's that the part which really counts is the part which is never  seen. Only the ornamental portion of a book's covering is exposed. The  portions which protect the book and render it at once firm and flexible  are out of sight and unheeded by the ordinary reader. Hence the  existence of so much bookbinding that is apparently good and essentially  bad, and hence the perpetual timeliness of attempts like that of the  present chapter, to point out what binding is and should be. The  processes in bookbinding by which its different ends of utility and  ornament are achieved are known under the two heads of Forwarding and  Finishing.    Forwarding includes many processes, literally \"all but the finishing.\"  It is to forwarding that a book owes its shapeliness, its firmness, its  flexibility, and its durability. Forwarding takes the unfolded and  unarranged sheets as delivered by the printer and transforms them into a  book complete in all but its outermost covering of cloth or leather. The  first process is to fold the sheets and reduce their strange medley of  page numbers to an orderly succession. This is assuming that there is a  whole edition to be bound. If it consists of a thousand copies, then  there will be a certain number of piles of folded sheets, each  containing a thousand copies of the same pages printed in groups, let us  say, of sixteen each. These groups of pages are called sections or  signatures. They are now rearranged, or gathered, into a thousand piles,  each containing the signatures that belong to one book. The edition is  thus separated into its thousand books, which the collator goes over to  see that each is perfect. Let us follow the fortunes of a single one. It  is not much of a book to look at, being rather a puffy heap of paper,  but pressing, rolling, or beating soon reduces it to normal dimensions,  and it is then carried forward to the important process of sewing. This  is the very heart of the whole work. If the book is badly sewed, it will  be badly bound, though a thousand dollars were to be spent upon the  decoration of its covering. There is only one best method of sewing, and  that is around raised cords, in the way followed by the earliest  binders. There are modern machine methods that are very good, but they  are only cheap substitutes for the best. The cords must be of good,  long-fibered hemp, and the thread of the best quality"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22607"],[0,"The Book-Hunter in London (#17)"],[1,"any  competition with those purchasers who wanted books of science and  _belles lettres_ for their own progressive or literary pursuits; thus  using the power of his purse in a manner at once merciful and wise.'    [Illustration: _George Nicol, the King's Bookseller._]    The impetus which book-collecting, and more particularly the section to  which we have just referred, received by the dispersal of the West  Library gathered in force as time went on, reaching its climax with the  Roxburghe sale thirty-nine years afterwards. The enthusiasm culminated  in a club--the Roxburghe, which still flourishes. The warfare (at  Roxburghe House, St. James's Square), as Mr. Silvanus Urban has  recorded, was equalled only by the courage and gallantry displayed on  the plains of Salamanca about the same period. 'As a pillar, or other  similar memorial, could not be conveniently erected to mark the spot  where so many bibliographical champions fought and conquered, another  method was adopted to record their fame, and perpetuate this brilliant  epoch in literary annals. Accordingly, a phalanx of the most hardy  veterans has been enrolled under the banner of the far-famed Valdarfer's  Boccaccio of 1471. . . . The first anniversary meeting of this noble  band was celebrated at the St. Alban's Tavern [St. Alban's Street, now  Waterloo Place] on Thursday, June 17, 1813, being the memorable day on  which the before-mentioned Boccaccio was sold for L2,260. The chair was  taken by Earl Spencer (perpetual president of the club), supported by  Lords Morpeth and Gower, and the following gentlemen,[61:A] viz., Sir E.  Brydges, Messrs. W. Bentham, W. Bolland, J. Dent, T. F. Dibdin  (vice-president), Francis Freeling, Henry Freeling, Joseph Hazlewood,  Richard Heber, Thomas C. Heber, G. Isted, R. Lang, J. H. Markland, J. D.  Phelps, T. Ponton, junior, J. Towneley, E. V. Utterson, and R.  Wilbraham. Upon the cloth being removed, the following appropriate  toasts were delivered from the chair:          1. The cause of Bibliomania all over the world.          2. The immortal memory of Christopher Valdarfer,             the printer of the Boccaccio of 1471.          3. The immortal memory of William Caxton, first             English printer.          4. The immortal memory of Wynkyn de Worde.          5. The immortal memory of Richard Pynson.          6. The immortal memory of Julian Notary.          7. The immortal memory of William Faques.          8. The immortal memory of the Aldine family.          9. The immortal memory of the Stephenses.         10. The immortal memory of John, Duke of Roxburghe.    'After these the health of the noble president was proposed, and  received by the company standing, with three times three. Then followed  the health of the worthy vice-president (proposed by Mr. Heber),  which, it is scarcely necessary to observe, was drunk with similar  honours. . . . The president was succeeded in the chair by Lord Gower,  who, at midnight, yielded to Mr. Dent; and that gentleman gave way to  the Prince of Bibliomaniacs, Mr. Heber. Though the night, or rather the  morning, wore apace, it was not likely that a seat so occupied would be  speedily deserted; accordingly, the \"regal purple stream\" ceased not to  flow till \"Morning oped her golden gates,\" or, in plain terms, till past  four o'clock.' Such is a brief account of the Roxburghe Club, which is  limited to thirty-one members, one black ball being fatal to the  candidate who offers himself for a vacancy, and each member in his  annual turn has to print a book or pamphlet, and to present to his  fellow-members a copy. Before making any further reference to the  _personnel_ of the Roxburghe Club, we quote, from a literary journal of  1823, the following trenchant paragraph, _a propos_ of a similar club in  Scotland:    'BIBLIOMANIA.--This most ridiculous of all the affectations of the day  has lately exhibited another instance of its diffusion, in the  establishment of a _Roxburghe[62:A] Club_ in Edinburgh. Its object, we  are told, \"is the republication of scarce and valuable tracts,  especially poetry.\"--\"Republication!\" In what manner? Commonsense forbid  that the system of the London Roxburghe Club be adopted. Of this there  are some four-and-twenty members or so, who dine together a certain  number of times in the year, and each member in his turn republishes  some old tract at his own expense. There are just so many copies printed  as there are members of the club, and one copy is presented to each. It  is evident that no sort of good can be effected by this system, and,  indeed, there has not yet resulted any benefit to the literature of the  country from the Roxburghe Club. They have not published a single book  of any conceivable merit. The truth is that the members, for the most  part, are a set of persons of no true taste, of no proper notion of  learning and its uses--very considerable persons in point of wealth, but  very _so-so_ in point of intellect.'    [Illustration: _Thomas Frognall Dibdin, Bibliographer._]    The primary aim and object of the Roxburghe Club were clearly enough  indicated in the first list of members, for the association of men with  kindred tastes is at all times a highly commendable one. The Roxburghe  Club might have sustained its _raison d'etre_, if it had drawn the line  at such men as Thomas Frognall Dibdin and Joseph Hazlewood. The  foregoing extract from the _Museum_ of 1823 exactly indicates the  position which the club at that time held in public estimation. It had  degenerated into a mere drinking and gormandizing association, alike a  disgrace to its more respectable members and an insult to the nobleman  whose name it was dragging through the mire. Those who have an  opportunity of consulting the _Athenaeum_ for 1834 will find, in the  first four issues of January, one of the most scathing exposures to  which any institution has ever been subjected. Hazlewood had died, and  his books came into the sale-room. Never had the adage of 'Dead men tell  no tales' been more completely falsified. Hazlewood, who does not seem  to have been unpleasantly particular in telling the truth when living,  told it with a vengeance after his death; for among his papers there was  a bundle entitled 'Roxburghe Revels,' which Thorpe purchased for L40,  the editor of the _Athenaeum_ being the under-bidder. A few days  afterwards, and for the weighty consideration of a L10 note profit, the  lot passed into the hands of Mr. Dilke, and the articles to which we  have referred followed.[64:A] If anything could have made the deceased  Joseph turn in his grave, it would have been the attention which he  received at the unsparing hands of Mr. Dilke. The excellent Mr. Dibdin  survived the exposure several years. The castigation proved beneficial  to the club; and if its revelries were no less boisterous than  heretofore, it at all events circulated among its members books worthy  of the name of Roxburghe, and edited in a scholarly manner. The club  still flourishes, with the Marquis of Salisbury as its president, and  the list of its members will be found in our chapter on 'Modern  Collectors.'    [Illustration: _Rev. C. Mordaunt Cracherode, M.A., Book-collector._]    One of the mighty book-hunters of the last century was the Rev. Clayton  Mordaunt Cracherode (whose father went out as a commander of marines in  Anson's ship, and whose share in the prize-money made him a wealthy  man), who died on April 6, 1799, in his seventieth year. His splendid  library now forms a part of the British Museum. It contains the most  choice copies in classical and Biblical literature, and many of these  are on vellum. His collection of editions of the fifteenth century Mr.  Cracherode used modestly to call a 'specimen' one; 'they form perhaps  the most perfect _collana_ or necklace ever strung by one man.' Several  of the books formerly belonged to Grolier. His library was valued at  L10,000 at or about the time of his death; it would probably now realize  considerably over ten times that amount if submitted to auction. The  value of his prints was placed at L5,000. Cracherode was an excellent  scholar, and an amiable; his passion for collecting was strong even in  death, for whilst he was at the last extremity his agent was making  purchases for him. He was one of the most constant habitues of Tom  Payne's, and at his final visit he put an Edinburgh Terence in one  pocket and a large-paper Cebes in the other. His house was in Queen  Square, Westminster, overlooking St. James's Park.    Reverting once more to the change which had been effected in the fancies  of book-collectors, James Bindley, whose library was sold after his  decease in 1819, and James Perry, who died in 1821, may be regarded as  typical collectors of the transition period. Both are essentially London  book-hunters--the former was an official in the Stamp Office, and the  latter was, _inter alia_, the editor of the _Morning Chronicle_.  Bindley, to whom John Nichols dedicated his 'Literary Anecdotes,' was a  book-hunter who made very practical use of his scholarly tastes and  ample means. He haunted the bookstalls and shops with the pertinacity of  a tax-gatherer, and if his original expenditure were placed by the side  of the total which his collection of books brought after his death, no  more convincing arguments in favour of book-hunting could possibly be  needed. Bindley is the 'Leontes' of Dibdin's 'Bibliographical  Decameron,' and his collection of poetical rarities of the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries was one of the most remarkable which had ever been  got together. Not many of the items had cost him more than a few  shillings each, and they realized almost as many pounds as he had paid  shillings. Perry was a journalist first and a book-collector afterwards,  but in many respects there was a great similarity in the tastes of the  two rival bibliophiles. Perry's was the more"]]]
