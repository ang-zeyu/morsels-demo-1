These instances are trivial compared to the  courage and prowess yearly displayed by hundreds of attorneys who plunge  into the ocean of litigation in order to swim towards the distant buoys  which the sun of prosperity always cheers with enlivening beams.    Don't waste sympathy in this connection for the young Sawbones. _His_  thirst for action can be slaked at pauper fountains. For _him_ the  emigrant's chamber, the cabin of the arriving ship, the dispensary, the  asylums, the hospitals, and the poor-houses, are always open; and if his  \"soul be in arms,\" there are (Heaven knows) \"frays\" in this city numerous  enough for any ambitious surgical eagerness.    But for the aspiring attorney where are the avenues open for gratuitous  action? Do merchants nail up promissory notes upon awning posts for  attorneys to seize and put in suit? What \"old nobs\" of Wall-street are  willing to put themselves \"in chancery\" to oblige Hopper Tape, Esq., your  humble attendant upon the Where are the courts possessing suits without  counsel?    We may be told of unfortunate wretches who murder in drunken fits to whom  counsel are assigned. But what are ten crusts of bread per annum among a  thousand hungry dogs?    Thou must face the truth, young college boy, who now and then dost stroll  into court-rooms, or who dost lounge away an hour in a friend's law office  admiring his books and piles of papers--thinking the while of the time when  thou wilt have graduated and obtained permission to hang up thy  pomp-gilded \"shingle:\" _thou must face the truth_! The counsel who so  attracts thy admiration, in thy court-room lounging, has fought weary  years with myriad obstacles; there are the ashes of many nights and days  of toil and struggle sprinkled upon his hair; he has fought his way (from  where thou sittest a listener to where he stands a speaker), as if through  an Indian gauntlet file. There were a hundred mouths waiting for the first  crumbs which came to his impatient legal digestion; and a hundred envious  heads and hearts to worry him if possible into a dyspepsia over those  crumbs. He has began with an office in a fifth story, and _climbed down_  towards the street. He commenced to hive his honey near the roof! While  out of his office he climbed a professional ladder, the holding on to  which tasked all his powers of physical, mental, and pecuniary endurance.  Face the truth!    Reach me yonder diary and legal register. Two thousand practising lawyers  in the city of New-York! Out of these one hundred are \"notables;\" fifty  are \"distinguished;\" twenty-five are eminent.    A large body of them are \"conveyancers\" growing thin in person and thinner  in mind over deeds and titles; a larger body \"attorneys\"--getters up and  supervisors of suits--providers of ammunition for \"distinguished counsel\"  to discharge with loud reports (the said counsel brilliant by the flash:  the attorney obscured in the smoke); many, very many, chained to  \"larcenies\" at the Sessions, \"landlord dispossessions\" at the Marine  Court, suits on butcher's bills at Ward Courts, or \"malicious  prosecutions\" in the Common Pleas.    Yet there are hundreds of coral reefs and pearls for persevering divers in  this ocean of litigation. Three thousand pending cases every month are  three thousand nutshells where the meat is often fresh and oily, even with  the weary keeping on the calendar for months and years. There are _some_  counsel who pocket fees and costs to the tune of twenty thousand a year.  We know many a Quirk, Gammon and Snap, who realize an undoubted \"ten  thousand a year,\" with no Tittlebat Titmouse for a standing annoyance. And  we can taper off on the finger many who do not realize five hundred a  year, and work like negro slaves at that: they are continually rough  hewing, but no divinity shapes their ends.    Five years of \"starvation,\" and five more years of toil and trouble,  constitute the depth of a lawyer's slough of despond in New-York; to say  nothing of the giants' castles to storm upon the way, or the fights with  the Apolyons of Envy. Obviously so!    A man now-a-days will let a young Sawbones advise ice for his child's  croup, or even experiment with his own much-abused liver, when he would  not intrust a young attorney with the suing a note where ten witnesses saw  the note signed and the \"consideration money\" paid over. And if the public  really knew how much danger their pockets were in when the \"buttons\" were  under the control of inexperienced lawyers, the number of \"starvers\" would  be doubled. What \"eminent\" lawyer is there who does not look back to the  \"practice\" of his youth, in perfect terror to witness the mistakes he  made, as the helmsman, who has scudded through the breakers to the open  sea, glances back at the dangers he escaped?    The young lawyers of a year back are, however, five years--perhaps ten--in  advance of the lawyers of this year's growth. The latter have greater  rivalry in the _hordes_ of practitioners from the interior whom the \"new  code\" have driven from their _trespass quare clausum fregit_ into the  city. Many of them, too, were men of mark in their ports of departure,  bold and confident in their new haven!    One field, however, in the legal township of this city, offers room upon  its face for tillers--_the field of advocacy_! It is ploughed by some  twenty or thirty, and _harrowed_ by some fifty or sixty. There are a  _dozen_ whom the ghosts of Nisi Prius flock to hear upon great occasions.  And these will long hold the monopoly.    Why?    Because the advocate and barrister must have had vast experience at Nisi  Prius (or the court where matters of fact are investigated by judge and  jury); have acquired a practised tact; have had opportunities of testing  their own calibre to know if they are fitted for emergencies--as the  gunsmith tests his barrels before he \"stocks\" them. And the young lawyer  has small opportunity afforded him to acquire this tact--to permit this  testing. If he can play \"devil\" for a few years to some barrister of  extended practice, or scent \"occasions\" like a blood-hound on the trail of  the valuable fugitive from justice, then he is a happy man, and is in the  fair way of soon becoming a monopolist himself.    Any juryman of two years' standing will corroborate our statement as to  the openness of the field of legal advocacy. How often has he seen cause  after cause \"set down,\" \"reserved,\" or \"put off,\" because counsel are  engaged elsewhere? How often has he heard the same advocate in four or  five causes in the same week, in the same court, changing positions like  the queen of an active chess-board; profiting his fame and pocket by means  of only a hurried glance at the elaborate brief which his junior has \"got  up\" for him?    Some one has said that the barrister works hard, lives well, and dies  poor. Regarding the first two conditions of his life there is little doubt  upon the question of truth; the dying in poverty _may be_ problematical.  Yet in a recent print, professing to furnish a list of wealthy tax-payers,  the list contained four lawyers, and only one was a barrister. The  instance proves little, for a lawyer may be very rich and yet pay no  taxes. The assessors may fight shy of his bell-pull as they go their  rounds, because of his penchant to find flaws in their actions and bring  them official discredit in an apparently laborious task, but in reality a  sinecure of an employment.    We have often asked ourselves if barristers have stomachs. Bowels of  compassion they have not, that is certain; but have they stomachs? Say  nine times in a year they dine at the same hour of the day; and then spoon  their soup with the blood all drawn from the digestive apparatus to feed  the brain. Yet they eat like aldermen and drink like German princes....    This much of idle reverie, as, with pen in hand, we laid down the two  bulky and elaborately-published volumes whose title we have taken as text;  this much of glance at the condition of the young and old advocate of  to-day, before we digest our reflections upon the advocate and jurist of  the past.    It was our privilege in our legal novitiate (this is but _a phrase_; for a  lawyer is always in his novitiate) to have been, at the Cambridge Law  School, a pupil of Mr. Justice Story; and thus to have drank at the very  fountain head of constitutional law--that branch of our national  jurisprudence which can least fluctuate. Judges of a day and not of a  generation, or crazy legislators with spasmodic wisdom, may alter, and  overturn, and mystify by simplification, the laws and usages of every-day  life; but it is scarcely to be apprehended that the current of our  constitutional law will ever be diverted from original channels. There is  danger rather of its being dammed into stagnation.    While fully aware of his faults and foibles as a man, and his  idiosyncracies as a judge and a legal writer, we have never wavered in  loyalty to his judicial majesty, or found a flaw in the regard we paid to  his memory. And no book was more welcome to Zimmerman in his solitude than  these volumes regarding the illustrious judge, prepared by his son, were  welcome to our Christmas-holiday leisure.    Joseph Story was the eldest of eleven children, and lived to be indeed the  \"Joseph\" of mark and renown to his father and brothers. He was born in  Marblehead, September 18th, 1779. His father was a physician, and served  during a portion of the Revolution as army surgeon. He died when the  future judge was twenty-six years of age: yet what the son then was is  best told by one sentence from the father's will--after making his wife  sole executrix, he recommends her to his son Joseph, adding, \"and although  this perhaps is needless, I do it to mark my special confidence in his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20116"],[0,"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, Volume 1 (of 3) (#17)"],[1,"have  regarded death by disease or even by accident or violence as an  unnatural event which has been brought about by sorcery and which must  be avenged by the death of the sorcerer. If that has been so, we seem  bound to conclude that a belief in magic or sorcery has had a most  potent influence in keeping down the numbers of savage tribes; since as  a rule every natural death has entailed at least one, often several,  sometimes many deaths by violence. This may help us to understand what  an immense power for evil the world-wide faith in magic or sorcery has  been among men.    [Sidenote: But some savages have attributed death to other causes than  sorcery.]    But even savages come in time to perceive that deaths are sometimes  brought about by other causes than sorcery. We have seen that some of  them admit extreme old age, accidents, and violence as causes of death  which are independent of sorcery. The admission of these exceptions to  the general rule certainly marks a stage of intellectual progress. I  will give a few more instances of such admissions before concluding this  part of my subject.    [Sidenote: Some savages dissect the corpse to ascertain whether death  was due to natural causes or to sorcery.]    In the first place, certain savage tribes are reported to dissect the  bodies of their dead in order to ascertain from an examination of the  corpse whether the deceased died a natural death or perished by magic.  This is reported by Mr. E. R. Smith concerning the Araucanians of Chili,  who according to other writers, as we saw,[51] believe all deaths to be  due to sorcery. Mr. Smith tells us that after death the services of the  _machi_ or medicine-man \"are again required, especially if the deceased  be a person of distinction. The body is dissected and examined. If the  liver be found in a healthy state, the death is attributed to natural  causes; but if the liver prove to be inflamed, it is supposed to  indicate the machinations of some evil-intentioned persons, and it rests  with the medicine-man to discover the conspirator. This is accomplished  by much the same means that were used to find out the nature of the  disease. The gall is extracted, put in the magic drum, and after various  incantations taken out and placed over the fire, in a pot carefully  covered; if, after subjecting the gall to a certain amount of roasting,  a stone is found in the bottom of the pot, it is declared to be the  means by which death was produced. These stones, as well as the frogs,  spiders, arrows, or whatever else may be extracted from the sick man,  are called _Huecuvu_--the 'Evil One.' By aid of the _Huecuvu_ the  _machi_ [medicine-man] throws himself into a trance, in which state he  discovers and announces the person guilty of the death, and describes  the manner in which it was produced.\"[52]    Again, speaking of the Pahouins, a tribe of the Gaboon region in French  Congo, a Catholic missionary writes thus: \"It is so rare among the  Pahouins that a death is considered natural! Scarcely has the deceased  given up the ghost when the sorcerer appears on the scene. With three  cuts of the knife, one transverse and two lateral, he dissects the  breast of the corpse and turns down the skin on the face. Then he  grabbles in the breast, examines the bowels attentively, marks the last  muscular contractions, and thereupon pronounces whether the death was  natural or not.\" If he decides that the death was due to sorcery, the  suspected culprit has to submit to the poison ordeal in the usual manner  to determine his guilt or innocence.[53]    [Sidenote: The possibility of natural death admitted by the  Melanesians.]    Another savage people who have come to admit the possibility of merely  natural death are the Melanesians of the New Hebrides and other parts of  Central Melanesia. Amongst them \"any sickness that is serious is  believed to be brought about by ghosts or spirits; common complaints  such as fever and ague are taken as coming in the course of nature. To  say that savages are never ill without supposing a supernatural cause is  not true of Melanesians; they make up their minds as the sickness comes  whether it is natural or not, and the more important the individual who  is sick, the more likely his sickness is to be ascribed to the anger of  a ghost whom he has offended, or to witchcraft. No great man would like  to be told that he was ill by natural weakness or decay. The sickness is  almost always believed to be caused by a ghost, not by a spirit....  Generally it is to the ghosts of the dead that sickness is ascribed in  the eastern islands as well as in the western; recourse is had to them  for aid in causing and removing sickness; and ghosts are believed to  inflict sickness not only because some offence, such as a trespass, has  been committed against them, or because one familiar with them has  sought their aid with sacrifice and spells, but because there is a  certain malignity in the feeling of all ghosts towards the living, who  offend them by being alive.\"[54] From this account we learn, first, that  the Melanesians admit some deaths by common diseases, such as fever and  ague, to be natural; and, second, that they recognise ghosts and spirits  as well as sorcerers and witches, among the causes of death; indeed they  hold that ghosts are the commonest of all causes of sickness and death.    [Sidenote: The possibility of natural death admitted by the Caffres of  South Africa.]    The same causes of death are recognised also by the Caffres of South  Africa, as we learn from Mr. Dudley Kidd, who tells us that according to  the beliefs of the natives, \"to start with, there is sickness which is  supposed to be caused by the action of ancestral spirits or by fabulous  monsters. Secondly, there is sickness which is caused by the magical  practices of some evil person who is using witchcraft in secret.  Thirdly, there is sickness which comes from neither of these causes, and  remains unexplained. It is said to be 'only sickness, and nothing more.'  This third form of sickness is, I think, the commonest. Yet most writers  wholly ignore it, or deny its existence. It may happen that an attack of  indigestion is one day attributed to the action of witch or wizard;  another day the trouble is put down to the account of ancestral spirits;  on a third occasion the people may be at a loss to account for it, and  so may dismiss the problem by saying that it is merely sickness. It is  quite common to hear natives say that they are at a loss to account for  some special case of illness. At first they thought it was caused by an  angry ancestral spirit; but a great doctor has assured them that it is  not the result of such a spirit. They then suppose it to be due to the  magical practices of some enemy; but the doctor negatives that theory.  The people are, therefore, driven to the conclusion that the trouble has  no ascertainable cause. In some cases they do not even trouble to  consult a diviner; they speedily recognise the sickness as due to  natural causes. In such a case it needs no explanation. If they think  that some friend of theirs knows of a remedy, they will try it on their  own initiative, or may even go off to a white man to ask for some of his  medicine. They would never dream of doing this if they thought they were  being influenced by magic or by ancestral spirits. The Kafirs quite  recognise that there are types of disease which are inherited, and have  not been caused by magic or by ancestral spirits. They admit that some  accidents are due to nothing but the patient's carelessness or  stupidity. If a native gets his leg run over by a waggon, the people  will often say that it is all his own fault through being clumsy. In  other cases, with delightful inconsistency, they may say that some one  has been working magic to cause the accident. In short, it is impossible  to make out a theory of sickness which will satisfy our European  conception of consistency.\"[55]    [Sidenote: The admission that death may be due to natural causes, marks  an intellectual advance. The recognition of ghosts or spirits as a cause  of disease, apart from sorcery, also marks a step in intellectual,  moral, and social progress.]    From the foregoing accounts we see that the Melanesians and the Caffres,  two widely different and widely separated races, agree in recognising at  least three distinct causes of what we should call natural death. These  three causes are, first, sorcery or witchcraft; second, ghosts or  spirits; and third, disease.[56] That the recognition of disease in  itself as a cause of death, quite apart from sorcery, marks an  intellectual advance, will not be disputed. It is not so clear, though I  believe it is equally true, that the recognition of ghosts or spirits as  a cause of disease, quite apart from witchcraft, marks a real step in  intellectual, moral, and social progress. In the first place, it marks a  step in intellectual and moral progress; for it recognises that effects  which before had been ascribed to human agency spring from superhuman  causes; and this recognition of powers in the universe superior to man  is not only an intellectual gain but a moral discipline: it teaches the  important lesson of humility. In the second place it marks a step in  social progress because when the blame of a death is laid upon a ghost  or a spirit instead of on a sorcerer, the death has not to be avenged by  killing a human being, the supposed author of the calamity. Thus the  recognition of ghosts or spirits as the sources of sickness and death  has as its immediate effect the sparing of an immense number of lives of  men and women, who on the theory of death by sorcery would have perished  by violence to expiate their imaginary crime. That this is a great gain  to society is obvious: it adds immensely to the security of human life  by removing one of the most fruitful causes of its"]]]
