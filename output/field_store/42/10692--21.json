We  have thus the two systems of chronology to compare--one, the  astronomical chronology measured by the successive stages in the  gradual retreat of the moon; the other, the geological chronology  measured by the successive strata constituting the earth's crust.  Never was a more noble problem proposed in the physical history of our  earth than that which is implied in the attempt to correlate these two  systems of chronology. What we would especially desire to know is the  moon's distance which corresponds to each of the successive strata on  the earth. How far off, for instance, was that moon which looked down  on the coal forests in the time of their greatest luxuriance? or what  was the apparent size of the full moon at which the ichthyosaurus  could have peeped when he turned that wonderful eye of his to the sky  on a fine evening? But interesting as this great problem is, it lies,  alas! outside the possibility of exact solution. Indeed we shall not  make any attempt which must necessarily be futile to correlate these  chronologies; all we can do is to state the one fact which is  absolutely undeniable in the matter.    Let us fix our attention on that specially interesting epoch at the  dawn of geological time, when those mighty Laurentian rocks were  deposited of which the thickness is so astounding, and let us consider  what the distance of the moon must have been at this initial epoch of  the earth's history. All we know for certain is, that the moon must  have been nearer, but what proportion that distance bore to the  present distance is necessarily quite uncertain. Some years ago I  delivered a lecture at Birmingham, entitled \"A Glimpse through the  Corridors of Time,\" and in that lecture I threw out the suggestion  that the moon at this primeval epoch may have only been at a small  fraction of its present distance from us, and that consequently  terrific tides may in these days have ravaged the coast. There was a  good deal of discussion on the subject, and while it was universally  admitted that the tides must have been larger in palaeozoic times than  they are at present, yet there was a considerable body of opinion to  the effect that the tides even then may have been only about twice, or  possibly not so much, greater than those tides we have at the present.  What the actual fact may be we have no way of knowing; but it is  interesting to note that even the smallest accession to the tides  would be a valuable factor in the performance of geological work.    For let me recall to your minds a few of the fundamental phenomena of  geology. Those stratified rocks with which we are now concerned have  been chiefly manufactured by deposition of sediment in the ocean.  Rivers, swollen, it may be, by floods, and turbid with a quantity of  material held in suspension, discharge their waters into the sea.  Granting time and quiet, this sediment falls to the bottom; successive  additions are made to its thickness during centuries and thousands of  years, and thus beds are formed which in the course of ages  consolidate into actual rock. In the formation of such beds the tides  will play a part. Into the estuaries at the mouths of rivers the tides  hurry in and hurry out, and especially during spring tides there are  currents which flow with tremendous power; then too, as the waves  batter against the coast they gradually wear away and crumble down the  mightiest cliffs, and waft the sand and mud thus produced to augment  that which has been brought down by the rivers. In this operation also  the tides play a part of conspicuous importance, and where the ebb and  flow is greatest it is obvious that an additional impetus will be  given to the manufacture of stratified rocks. In fact, we may regard  the waters of the globe as a mighty mill, incessantly occupied in  grinding up materials for future strata. The main operating power of  this mill is of course derived from the sun, for it is the sun which  brings up the rains to nourish the rivers, it is the sun which raises  the wind which lashes the waves against the shore. But there is an  auxiliary power to keep the mill in motion, and that auxiliary power  is afforded by the tides. If then we find that by any cause the  efficiency of the tides is increased we shall find that the mill for  the manufacture of strata obtains a corresponding accession to its  capacity. Assuming the estimate of Professor Darwin, that the tide may  have had twice as great a vertical range of ebb and flow within  geological times as it has at present, we find a considerable addition  to the efficiency of the ocean in the manufacture of the ancient  stratified rocks. It must be remembered that the extent of the area  through which the tides will submerge and lay bare the country, will  often be increased more than twofold by a twofold increase of height.  A little illustration may show what I mean. Suppose a cone to be  filled with water up to a certain height, and that the quantity of  water in it be measured; now let the cone be filled until the water is  at double the depth; then the surfaces of the water in the two cases  will be in the ratio of the circles, one of which has double the  diameter of the other. The areas of the two surfaces are thus as four  to one; the volumes of the waters in the two cases will be in the  proportion of two similar solids, the ratios of their dimensions being  as two to one. Of course this means that the water in the one case  would be eight times as much as in the other. This particular  illustration will not often apply exactly to tidal phenomena, but I  may mention one place that I happen to know of, in the vicinity of  Dublin, in which the effect of the rise and fall of the tide would be  somewhat of this description. At Malahide there is a wide shallow  estuary cut off from the sea by a railway embankment, and there is a  viaduct in the embankment through which a great tidal current flows in  and out alternately. At low tide there is but little water in this  estuary, but at high tide it extends for miles inland. We may regard  this inlet with sufficient approximation to the truth as half of a  cone with a very large angle, the railway embankment of course forming  the diameter; hence it follows that if the tide was to be raised to  double its height, so large an area of additional land would be  submerged, and so vast an increase of water would be necessary for the  purpose, that the flow under the railway bridge would have to be much  more considerable than it is at present. In some degree the same  phenomena will be repeated elsewhere around the coast. Simply  multiplying the height of the tide by two would often mean that the  border of land between high and low water would be increased more than  twofold, and that the volume of water alternately poured on the land  and drawn off it would be increased in a still larger proportion. The  velocity of all tidal currents would also be greater than at present,  and as the power of a current of water for transporting solid material  held in suspension increases rapidly with the velocity, so we may  infer that the efficiency of tidal currents as a vehicle for the  transport of comminuted rocks would be greatly increased. It is thus  obvious that tides with a rise and fall double in vertical height of  those which we know at present would add a large increase to their  efficiency as geological agents. Indeed, even were the tides only half  or one-third greater than those we know now, we might reasonably  expect that the manufacture of stratified rocks must have proceeded  more rapidly than at present.    The question then will assume this form. We know that the tides must  have been greater in Cambrian or Laurentian days than they are at  present; so that they were available as a means of assisting other  agents in the stupendous operations of strata manufacture which were  then conducted. This certainly helps us to understand how these  tremendous beds of strata, a dozen miles or more in solid thickness,  were deposited. It seems imperative that for the accomplishment of a  task so mighty, some agents more potent than those with which we are  familiar should be required. The doctrine of tidal evolution has shown  us what those agents were. It only leaves us uninformed as to the  degree in which their mighty capabilities were drawn upon.    It is the property of science as it grows to find its branches more  and more interwoven, and this seems especially true of the two  greatest of all natural sciences--geology and astronomy. With the  beginnings of our earth as a globe in the shape in which we find it  both these sciences are directly concerned. I have here touched upon  another branch in which they illustrate and confirm each other.    As the theory of tidal evolution has shed such a flood of light into  the previously dark history of our earth-moon system, it becomes of  interest to see whether the tidal phenomena may not have a wider  scope; whether they may not, for instance, have determined the  formation of the planets by birth from the sun, just as the moon seems  to have originated by birth from the earth. Our first presumption,  that the cases are analogous, is not however justified when the facts  are carefully inquired into. A principle which I have not hitherto  discussed here assumes prominence, and therefore we shall devote our  attention to it for a few minutes.    Let us understand what we mean by the solar system. There is first the  sun at the centre, which preponderates over all the other bodies so  enormously, as shown in Fig. 4, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24388"],[0,"Squirrels and Other Fur-Bearers (#17)"],[1,"shoulders were so large in proportion to the body as to  give him a comical look. He could not walk about yet, and had never  before been above ground. Every moment or two he would whistle cheerily,  as the old one does when safe in his den with the farm-dog fiercely  baying outside.    We took the youngster home, and my little boy was delighted over the  prospect of a tame woodchuck. Not till the next day would he eat. Then,  getting a taste of the milk, he clutched the spoon that held it with  great eagerness, and sucked away like a little pig. We were all  immensely diverted by him. He ate eagerly, grew rapidly, and was soon  able to run about.    As the old one had been killed, we became curious as to the fate of the  rest of her family, for no doubt there were more. Had she moved them, or  had we intercepted her on her first trip? We knew where the old den was,  but not the new. So we would keep a lookout. Near the end of the week,  on passing by the old den, there were three young ones creeping about a  few feet from its mouth. They were starved out, and had come forth to  see what could be found. We captured them all, and the young family was  again united. How these poor, half-famished creatures did lay hold of  the spoon when they got a taste of the milk! One could not help  laughing. Their little shining black paws were so handy and so smooth;  they seemed as if encased in kid gloves. The captives throve well upon  milk, and then upon milk and clover.    But after the novelty of the thing had worn off, the boy found he had  incumbered himself with serious duties in assuming the position of  foster-mother to this large family; so he gave them all away but one,  the first one captured, which had outstripped all the others in growth.  This soon became a very amusing pet, but he always protested when  handled, and always objected to confinement. I should mention that the  cat had a kitten about the age of the chuck, and, as she had more milk  than the kitten could dispose of, the chuck, when we first got him, was  often placed in the nest with the kitten, and was regarded by the cat as  tenderly as her own, and allowed to nurse freely. Thus a friendship  sprang up between the kitten and the woodchuck, which lasted as long as  the latter lived. They would play together precisely like two  kittens,--clinch and tumble about and roll upon the grass in a very  amusing way. Finally the woodchuck took up his abode under the floor of  the kitchen, and gradually relapsed into a half-wild state. He would  permit no familiarities from any one save the kitten, but each day they  would have a turn or two at their old games of rough-and-tumble. The  chuck was now over half grown, and procured his own living. One day the  dog, who had all along looked upon him with a jealous eye, encountered  him too far from cover, and his career ended then and there.    In July the woodchuck was forgotten in our interest in a little gray  rabbit which we found nearly famished. It was so small that it could sit  in the hollow of one's hand. Some accident had probably befallen its  mother. The tiny creature looked spiritless and forlorn. We had to force  the milk into its mouth. But in a day or two it began to revive, and  would lap the milk eagerly. Soon it took to grass and clover, and then  to nibbling sweet apples and early pears. It grew rapidly, and was one  of the softest and most harmless-looking pets I had ever seen. For a  month or more the little rabbit was the only company I had, and it  helped to beguile the time immensely. In coming in from the field or  from my work, I seldom failed to bring it a handful of red clover  blossoms, of which it became very fond. One day it fell slyly to licking  my hand, and I discovered it wanted salt. I would then moisten my  fingers, dip them into the salt, and offer them to the rabbit. How  rapidly the delicate little tongue would play upon them, darting out to  the right and left of the large front incisors, the slender paws being  pressed against my hand as if to detain it!    But the rabbit proved really untamable; its wild nature could not be  overcome. In its large box-cage or prison, where it could see nothing  but the tree above it, it was tame, and would at times frisk playfully  about my hand and strike it gently with its forefeet; but the moment it  was liberated in a room, or let down in the grass with a string about  its neck, all its wild nature came forth. In the room it would run and  hide; in the open it would make desperate efforts to escape, and leap  and bound as you drew in the string that held it. At night, too, it  never failed to try to make its escape from the cage, and finally, when  two thirds grown, it succeeded, and we saw it no more.          XV    A LIFE OF FEAR      As I sat looking from my window the other morning upon a red squirrel  gathering nuts from a small hickory, and storing them up in his den in  the bank, I was forcibly reminded of the state of constant fear and  apprehension in which the wild creatures live, and I tried to picture to  myself what life would be to me, or to any of us, hedged about by so  many dangers, real or imaginary.    The squirrel would shoot up the tree, making only a brown streak from  the bottom to the top; would seize his nut and rush down again in the  most hurried manner. Half way to his den, which was not over three rods  distant, he would rush up the trunk of another tree for a few yards to  make an observation. No danger being near, he would dive into his den  and reappear again in a twinkling.    Returning for another nut, he would mount the second tree again for  another observation. Satisfied that the coast was clear, he would spin  along the top of the ground to the tree that bore the nuts, shoot up it  as before, seize the fruit, and then back again to his retreat.    Never did he fail during the half hour or more that I watched him to  take an observation on his way both to and from his nest. It was \"snatch  and run\" with him. Something seemed to say to him all the time: \"Look  out! look out!\" \"The cat!\" \"The hawk!\" \"The owl!\" \"The boy with the  gun!\"    It was a bleak December morning; the first fine flakes of a cold,  driving snowstorm were just beginning to sift down, and the squirrel was  eager to finish harvesting his nuts in time. It was quite touching to  see how hurried and anxious and nervous he was. I felt like going out  and lending a hand. The nuts were small, poor pig-nuts, and I thought of  all the gnawing he would have to do to get at the scanty meat they held.  My little boy once took pity on a squirrel that lived in the wall near  the gate, and cracked the nuts for him, and put them upon a small board  shelf in the tree where he could sit and eat them at his ease.    [Illustration: RED SQUIRREL]    The red squirrel is not so provident as the chipmunk. He lays up stores  irregularly, by fits and starts; he never has enough put up to carry him  over the winter; hence he is more or less active all the season. Long  before the December snow, the chipmunk has for days been making hourly  trips to his den with full pockets of nuts or corn or buckwheat, till  his bin holds enough to carry him through to April. He need not, and I  believe does not, set foot out of doors during the whole winter. But the  red squirrel trusts more to luck.    As alert and watchful as the red squirrel is, he is frequently caught by  the cat. My Nig, as black as ebony, knows well the taste of his flesh. I  have known him to be caught by the black snake and successfully  swallowed. The snake, no doubt, lay in ambush for him.    This fear, this ever-present source of danger of the wild creatures, we  know little about. Probably the only person in the civilized countries  who is no better off than the animals in this respect is the Czar of  Russia. He would not even dare gather nuts as openly as my squirrel. A  blacker and more terrible cat than Nig would be lying in wait for him  and would make a meal of him. The early settlers in this country must  have experienced something of this dread of apprehension from the  Indians. Many African tribes now live in the same state of constant fear  of the slave-catchers or of other hostile tribes. Our ancestors, back in  prehistoric times, must have known fear as a constant feeling. Hence  the prominence of fear in infants and children when compared with the  youth or the grown person. Babies are nearly always afraid of strangers.    In the domestic animals also, fear is much more active in the young than  in the old. Nearly every farm boy has seen a calf but a day or two old,  which its mother has secreted in the woods or in a remote field, charge  upon him furiously with a wild bleat, when first discovered. After this  first ebullition of fear, it usually settles down into the tame humdrum  of its bovine elders.    Eternal vigilance is the price of life with most of the wild creatures.  There is only one among them whose wildness I cannot understand, and  that is the common water turtle. Why is this creature so fearful? What  are its enemies? I know of nothing that preys upon it. Yet see how  watchful and suspicious these turtles are as they sun themselves upon a  log or a rock. While you are yet many yards away from them, they slide  down into the water and are gone.    The land turtle, on the other hand, shows scarcely a trace of fear. He  will indeed pause in his walk when you are very near him, but he will  not retreat into his shell till you have poked him with your foot or  your cane. He appears to have no enemies; but the little spotted water  turtle is as shy as if he were the delicate tidbit that every creature  was searching for. I did once find one which a fox had dug out of the  mud in winter, and carried a few rods and dropped on the snow, as if he  had found he had no use for it.    One can understand the fearlessness of the skunk. Nearly every creature  but the"]]]
