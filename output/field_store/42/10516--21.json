The  earl was to have his property restored to him, and the city was to be  forgiven all trespasses committed against the king since the time that the  earl made his sojourn within its walls. The earl gave surety in 10,000  marks for keeping the peace, and the citizens paid the king of the Romans  1,000 marks for damages they had committed three years before in his manor  of Isleworth.(271) Not a word about the imprisoned mayor, Fitz-Thomas!    (M169)    The king's letters patent granting forgiveness to the citizens for  harbouring the Earl of Gloucester(272) were followed in the spring of the  following year by another charter to the city.(273) But inasmuch as this  charter did not restore the mayoralty, the citizens had little cause to be  thankful and looked upon it as only an instalment of favours to come.    (M170)    Towards the end of this year or early in the next (1269), the city was  committed by the king to his son Edward, who ruled it by deputy, Sir Hugh  Fitz-Otes being again appointed Constable of the Tower, and warden of the  city.(274) It was through the good offices of the prince, that the  citizens eventually recovered the right to elect their mayor, so long  withheld. \"About the same time, that is to say, Pentecost, 1270,\" writes  Fitz-Thedmar, \"at the instance of Sir Edward, his lordship the king  granted unto the citizens that they might have a mayor from among  themselves in such form as they were wont to elect him.\"(275)    (M171)    He further allowed them to choose two sheriffs who should discharge the  duties of sheriff, (_qui tenerent vicecomitatem_) of the City and  Middlesex, as formerly; but instead of the yearly ferm of L300 in pure  silver (_sterlingorum blancorum_), formerly paid for Middlesex, they were  thenceforth to pay an annual rent of L400 in money counted (_sterlingorum  computatorum_.)(276)    (M172)    The citizens lost no time in exercising their recovered rights. Their  choice fell upon John Adrian for the mayoralty, whilst Philip le Taillour  and Walter le Poter were elected sheriffs. After they had been severally  admitted into office--the mayor before the king himself on Wednesday, the  16th July, and the sheriffs at the Exchequer two days later--the king  restored the city's charters, and the citizens acknowledged the royal  favour by a gift of 100 marks to the king, and 500 marks to Prince Edward,  who had proved so good a friend to them, and who was about to set out for  the Holy Land.(277)    (M173)    Adrian was succeeded in the mayoralty by Walter Hervy, who had already  served as sheriff or bailiff on two occasions, once by royal appointment.  He made himself so popular with the \"commons\" of the city during his year  of office, that when October, 1272, came round and the aldermen and more  \"discreet\" citizens were in favour of electing Philip le Taillour as his  successor, the commons or \"mob of the city\"--as the chronicler prefers to  style them--cried out, \"Nay, nay, we will have no one for mayor but Walter  Hervi.\"(278)    (M174)    The aldermen finding themselves in a minority, appealed to the king and  council at Westminster. Hervy did the same, being accompanied to  Westminster by a large number of supporters, who took the opportunity of  the aldermen laying their case before the council to insist loudly, as  they waited in the adjacent hall, upon their own right of election and  their choice of Hervy. It was feared that the noise might disturb the king  who was confined to his bed with what proved to be his last illness. All  parties was therefore dismissed, injunction being laid upon Hervy not to  appear again with such a following, but to come with only ten or a dozen  supporters at the most.    (M175)    Hervy paid no heed to this warning, but continued to present himself at  Westminster every day for a fortnight, accompanied by his supporters in  full force, expecting an answer to be given by the council. At length the  council resolved to submit the whole question to arbitration, the city in  the meanwhile being placed in the custody of a warden. Before the  arbitrators got to work, the king died (16 Nov.), and rather than the city  should continue to be disturbed at such a crisis, the aldermen agreed to a  compromise, and Hervy was allowed to be mayor for one year more.(279)            CHAPTER V.          (M176)    Although the aldermen had been prevailed upon to give their assent to  Hervy's election to the mayoralty, his democratic tendencies made him an  object of dislike, more especially to Fitz-Thomas. When, therefore, that  chronicler records that throughout Hervy's year of office he did not allow  any pleading in the Husting for Pleas of Land except very rarely, for the  reason that the mayor himself was defendant in a suit brought against him  by Isabella Bukerel,(280) we hesitate to place implicit belief in his  statement.(281) We are inclined, moreover, to give less credit to anything  that Fitz-Thedmar may say against the mayor when we bear in mind that the  former had a personal grievance against the latter.(282)    (M177)    Hervy was a worthy successor to Fitz-Thomas, and, under his government,  the craft guilds improved their position. Fresh ordinances for the  regulation of various crafts were drawn up, and to these the mayor, on his  own responsibility, attached the city seal.(283) When Hervy's year of  office expired--these so-called \"charters\" were called in question as  having been unauthorised by the aldermen of the city and as tending to  favour the richer members of the guilds to the prejudice of the poorer.  After a \"wordy and most abusive dispute\" carried on in the Guildhall  between the ex-mayor and Gregory de Rokesley who acted as spokesman for  the body of aldermen, Hervy left the hall and summoned the craft-guilds to  meet him in Cheapside. There he told them that it was the wish of Henry le  Galeys (or Waleys) the mayor and others to infringe their charters, but  that if they could stand by him he would maintain those charters in all  their integrity.    Fearing lest a riot might follow, the chancellor--Walter de Merton, through  whose mediation Hervy had been at last accepted as mayor by the  aldermen--ordered his arrest. This was on the 20th December, 1273. Hervy  was, accordingly, attached but released on bail, and early in the  following January (1274), his charters were duly examined in the Husting  before all the people, and declared void. Thenceforth, every man was to  enjoy the utmost freedom in following his calling, always provided that  his work was good and lawful.(284)    (M178)    When the mayor removed certain butchers' and fishmongers' stalls from  Cheapside, in order that the main thoroughfare of the city might present a  creditable appearance to the king on his return from abroad, the owners of  the stalls, who complained of being disturbed in their freeholds--\"having  given to the sheriff a great sum of money for the same\"--found a champion  in Hervy. Their cause was pleaded at the Guildhall, and such \"a wordy  strife\" arose between Hervy and the mayor, that the session had to be  broken up, and Hervy's conduct was reported to the king's council. The  next day, upon the resumption of the session, a certain roll was produced  and publicly read, in which \"the presumptuous acts and injuries, of most  notorious character\" which Hervy was alleged to have committed during his  mayoralty were set forth at length.    (M179) (M180)    The charges against him were eight in number, of which some at least  appear to be in the last degree frivolous. He had on a certain occasion  borne false witness; he had failed on another occasion to attend at  Westminster upon a summons; he had failed to observe all the assizes made  by the aldermen and had allowed ale to be sold in his ward for three  halfpence a gallon; he had taken bribes for allowing corn and wine to be  taken out of the city for sale, and he had misappropriated a sum of money  which had been raised for a special purpose. Such was the general run of  the charges brought against him, in addition to which were the charges of  having permitted the guilds to make new statutes to their own advantage  and to the loss of the city and all the realm, as already narrated, and of  having procured \"certain persons of the city, of Stebney, of Stratford,  and of Hakeneye\" to make an unjust complaint against the mayor, \"who had  warranty sufficient for what he had done, namely, the council of his  lordship the king.\" This last charge had reference to the recent removal  of tradesmen's stalls from Chepe. No defence appears to have been allowed  Hervy. The charges were read, and he was then and there declared to be  \"judicially degraded from his aldermanry and for ever excluded from the  council of the city\"; a precept being at the same time issued for the  immediate election of a successor, to be presented at the next court.(285)    (M181)    From this time forward nothing more is heard of Hervy. The same cloud  envelopes his later history, that gathered round the last years of his  predecessor and political tutor Thomas Fitz-Thomas. The misfortune of both  of these men was that they lived before their age. Their works bore fruit  long after they had departed. The trade or craft guilds, as distinguished  from the more wealthy and influential mercantile guilds, eventually played  an important part in the city.

That's the funniest  wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want  to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?    TOOTSY. Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big,  tall little girl.    WISHING MAN (_laughing_). A great, big tall little girl, hey?    DUMPLING. And I want to be a great, big, big, _big_ little boy.    WISHING MAN.

Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a  pretty big job, you know.    TOOTSY. You said you could give us anything we wished for.    WISHING MAN. But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.    DUMPLING. That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.    WISHING MAN (_rubbing his chin and speaking thoughtfully_). Well,  now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first  place I haven't any marble.    CHILDREN. Marble?    WISHING MAN. Yes.

And we can all stand on top of the table.    WISHING MAN. But I have to stand here by the open window.    TOOTSY. Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay  here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.    WISHING MAN. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you  want to be made into great big, big little children?    CHILDREN. Yes, all of us.    WISHING MAN. All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine.  Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll  see what I can do for you.

It's a very foolish wish, but maybe they'll be satisfied  if I make them the biggest children on earth. (_Throws back curtains  at the window._) I'll see what I can do.    DUMPLING (_outside_).
