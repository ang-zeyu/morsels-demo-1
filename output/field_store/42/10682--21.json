One farm I found absolutely gutted save for a great and old  Bible which stood upon a table in the largest room. It was a beautiful  folio, full of quaint plates and fine old printing, and bound in a rich  leather that time and the sun had tanned to an autumn gold. While I was  regarding it the breeze came through the window and stirred the yellow  leaves, exposing a pencil-marked verse in the most pastoral of psalms:  \"_Hy doert my nederliggen in grasige wenden; Hy doert my sachtkens aen  seer stille wateren._\" There was something impressive in the accident:  the old book stoutly reminding the chance passer-by that present evil  cannot affect the ultimate good, promising amid rude circumstances a  time of quietness. He was an old man who owned that book; his name and  age were marked upon the leaf; I think, to judge by the signs of  handling, that he had the heart of its contents; and I hope that  whatever his bodily circumstances, his soul retained some of the peace  of the \"_grasige wenden_.\"    Who is responsible for all this mischief it is hard to say. I am sure  that the English soldiers, thoughtless though they may be, would not  stoop to this sort of purposeless outrage. I do not like to accuse the  colonial troops as a whole either, although I suspect that some of them,  some whose own homes had been destroyed by the enemy, might conceivably  have taken vengeance in kind. It is thought by many whose opinion is  valuable that the Kaffirs were here, as in Natal, responsible for much  of the damage; and that is a view which one would willingly take, for it  would acquit English-speaking troops of a miserable suspicion. Perhaps  the thing is well-nigh inevitable, for I know what pains Lord Roberts  took to prevent it; and it may be as well that we should recognise it as  one of the realities of war. For myself, the horrors of actual fighting  did not touch me half so nearly; I have seen men killed close to me and  been less shocked than I was by these domestic outrages. To die, for the  one who dies, is nothing; it affects him not at all; he is absent. But  here was not death, but outrage on the foundations of civilised life;  outrage upon living people, who suffer and remember.          PART IV    AN EXPEDITION WITH LORD METHUEN          XIII    IN THE FIELD AGAIN      After all, we need not have made so much haste to leave Bloemfontein. We  had been told there that a column would start for the relief of Mafeking  on March 20th, but when we arrived at Kimberley on the 18th we found  that no movement was to take place for several days. The date was  constantly shifted farther into the future, and the days of waiting had  grown into weeks before an order came that Lord Methuen with his force  of about 10,000 men was to march on Boshof. As far as information went  we lived from hand to mouth; all the orders came from Bloemfontein, and  they seldom provided for more than a day at a time. It was not  unnatural, therefore, that when an order to move did at last come we  built upon it all kinds of extravagant expectations, and it was a  cheerful army that left Kimberley on April 2nd and took the road for  Boshof.    After many days of inaction it was indeed good to recommence a moving  life among oxen and waggons and guns and soldiers. Kimberley was all  very well as a spectacle immediately after the siege; everyone flocked  to see the holes in the houses and the ruined buildings. It was all very  well (so, at any rate, we persuaded ourselves) to live in a club and to  dine again amid damask and flowers and cut glass after the rude life of  the fields; but even this was a novelty only for a day, and one soon  became impatient of the poor shift at living which dwellers in towns are  forced to make. I think I never saw a town so lost and drowned beneath  the wave of money-getting as Kimberley; even its recent privations were  turned to a nimble account, and 6-inch shells were selling at L10 apiece  before I left. The people who fled most readily from the projectiles  were of course the most eager to buy them--so highly do we esteem the  instruments which make us seem heroes to ourselves. For the moment  Kimberley transferred its attentions commercially from diamonds to  shells: a less romantic and (if you will believe it) a more sordid  industry; for there were already more storied and pedigreed shells in  private collections and for sale in Kimberley than ever fell into the  town.    Boshof, at any rate, provided a welcome change from all this. It is a  pretty little town of greensward streets and clear brooks; of white  cottages embowered in trees; of rose-gardens and orchards; rather like a  remote country town in Ireland--poor and pretty and sleepy. There were  few able-bodied men left in it, and aged people looked doubtfully out  from their fuchsia-covered doors upon the ranks and regiments of foreign  soldiers who came clattering through the streets on some of those hot  April afternoons. We were to advance, it was now thought, on the 6th; in  what direction we did not know certainly, but we suspected that it would  be along the Hoopstad Road. The arguments and speculations with which we  occupied ourselves need not be recorded now, but it was at once our hope  and fear that we should advance along the north bank of the Vaal. Hope,  because there was work to be done there; fear, lest our smaller force  should be absorbed by Lord Roberts's larger army and become merely its  left flank. Events showed that we might have spared ourselves both hopes  and fears, but fortunately we were ignorant, and so found occupation for  many an hour that had otherwise been empty.    An interval of inaction in the midst of a war is tedious in some ways,  but it is at least of benefit to a mere onlooker, who is thus enabled to  disengage himself from the whirl of operations and to discover the  results of his unwonted occupation. After having lived amongst  soldiers--in some ways and in spite of their profession the most human  and civilised of men--it had come upon me as a shock to find in  Kimberley the same bloodthirstiness that had distinguished the more  thoughtless section of the public at home. Cruel shouting for blood by  people who never see it; the iteration of that most illogical demand, a  life for a life--and, if possible, two lives for a life; the loud,  hectoring, frothy argument that lashes itself into a fury with strong  and abusive language--they all came like a clap of thunder after what I  am bound to call in comparison the quiet decency of the battlefield.  This is a grave thing to say, but it would be unfair to disguise so  clear an impression as this that I received, who went to South Africa  with so little political bias that eager partisans of neither colour in  Cape Town would own me. To appear lukewarm amongst people who are  red-hot is not always pleasant, but it has its compensations; one has at  least a foothold--inglorious, perhaps, but safe and desirable in a dizzy  world.    It was impossible to be in Kimberley and not to become involved in the  endless political discussions of clubs and dinner tables. I used to try  very hard to discover what it was that made the average Briton living in  South Africa hate the Boers so bitterly. The Colonial despises the Boer,  but one does not hate a man only because one despises him. Jealousy is  the best blend with contempt, and there is no doubt that the Boer's not  unnatural desire to be paramount in his own land was what English  colonists with whom I talked chiefly resented. We might talk for an hour  or for a day--the same old grievances always came round: the inferior  political position of the Uitlanders, the primitive, not to say dirty  and slovenly, habits of many Boer farmers, and their lack of energy.  These are the grievances of the man in the street, and they appear grave  enough--when once one has invested oneself with the right of censorship.  Then the rebels--wretched, unsuccessful farmers, who found themselves  misled and their ideas of duty confounded--these were the chief objects  of the lust for revenge. A rebel, as a man who has tried unsuccessfully  to overthrow by force the Government to which he owes allegiance, must  expect to suffer; but even in the case of these miserable creatures  there is surely a scale of responsibility to be observed and a measure  of justice to be meted. If Kimberley or Cape Town had ruled the matter  by their mass meetings nearly every rebel would have been hanged--a very  poor way, one would think, of making loyal subjects. But the reasons  that were urged in support of such drastic punishment were astonishingly  frank: \"It doesn't pay to be loyal,\" one was told; \"we might as well  have been rebels.\" Not a very lofty form of patriotism.    One came to shrink from using that grand word, so plausible a cloak did  it become for much that is mean and degrading. For example, when I was  riding from Bloemfontein to Kimberley I and my companion descried a  farmhouse two miles in front of us near Koodoesrand Drift; when we had  come within about a mile of it a little travesty of a Union Jack was run  up on a stick, and when we rode up to the door a farmer came out,  smiling, rubbing his hands, sniggering--in a word, truckling. His talk  was like the political swagger of the music-hall or the butler's pantry.    \"I'm John Bull to the core--eh? No damned Boers for me--eh? Ha, ha, wipe  'em out, gentlemen, wipe 'em out: old England's all right as long as  we've got gentlemen like you to defend us--eh?\" (He took us for  officers.) \"John Bull for ever--eh?\"    And while he spoke someone inside the house played \"God Save the Queen\"  with one finger (incorrectly) on a harmonium. The incident had a more  unpleasant flavour than I can well convey; we went away feeling ashamed.    All this belongs to the dark side of the campaign; fortunately there was  another, how bright I cannot say, that went far to make"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#17)"],[1," way molested him. It was incredible that the wontedly dignified and  sweet-tempered collie had thus returned a greeting. Especially from a  woman!    Mahan had often seen Red Cross nurses stop to caress Bruce. He had been  amused at the dog's almost protective cordiality toward all women,  whether the French peasants or the wearers of the brassard of mercy.    Toward men--except those he had learned to look on as friends--the  collie always comported himself with a courteous aloofness But he had  seemed to regard every woman as something to be humored and guarded and  to be treated with the same cordial friendliness that he bestowed on  their children--which is the way of the best type of collie. Yet Bruce  had actually snarled at this woman who had chirped to him from the  steps of the church! And he showed every sign of following up the  challenge by still more drastic measures.    \"Bruce!\" called Mahan sharply. \"BRUCE! Shame! Come over here! Come,  NOW!\"    At the Sergeant's vehement summons Bruce turned reluctantly away from  the foot of the church steps and came across the street toward the  estaminet. He came slowly. Midway he halted and looked back over his  shoulder at the nurse, his fangs glinting once more in a snarl. At a  second and more emphatic call from Mahan the dog continued his progress.    The nurse had started back in alarm at the collie's angry  demonstration. Now, gathering up her work, she retreated into the  church.    \"I'm sorry, Miss!\" Mahan shouted after her. \"I never saw him that way,  before, when a lady spoke to him. If it was any dog but old Bruce, I'd  give him a whaling for acting like that to you. I'm dead-sure he didn't  mean any harm.\"    \"Oh, I was going in, anyway,\" replied the nurse, from the doorway. \"It  is of no consequence.\"    She spoke nervously, her rich contralto voice shaken by the dog's  fierce show of enmity. Then she vanished into the church; and Mahan and  Vivier took turns in lecturing Bruce on his shameful dearth of courtesy.    The big dog paid no heed at all to his friends' discourse. He was  staring sullenly at the doorway through which the nurse had gone.    \"That's one swell way for a decently bred dog to treat a woman!\" Mahan  was telling him. \"Least of all, a Red Cross nurse! I'm clean ashamed of  you!\"    Bruce did not listen. In his heart he was still angry--and very much  perplexed as well. For he knew what these stupid humans did not seem to  know.    HE KNEW THE RED CROSS NURSE WAS NO WOMAN AT ALL, BUT A MAN.    Bruce knew, too, that the nurse did not belong to his loved friends of  the Red Cross. For his uncanny power of scent told him the garments  worn by the impostor belonged to some one else. To mere humans, a small  and slender man, who can act, and who dons woman's garb, is a woman. To  any dog, such a man is no more like a woman than a horse with a  lambskin saddle-pad is a lamb. He is merely a man who is differently  dressed from other men--even as this man who had chirped to Bruce, from  the church steps, was no less a man for the costume in which he had  swathed his body. Any dog, at a glance and at a sniff, would have known  that.    Women, for one thing, do not usually smoke dozens of rank cigars daily  for years, until their flesh is permeated with the smell of tobacco. A  human could not have detected such a smell--such a MAN-smell,--on the  person who had chirped to Bruce. Any dog, twenty feet away, would have  noticed it, and would have tabulated the white-clad masquerader as a  man. Nor do a woman's hair and skin carry the faint but unmistakable  odor of barracks and of tent-life and of martial equipment, as did this  man's. The masquerader was evidently not only a man but a soldier.    Dogs,--high-strung dogs,--do not like to have tricks played on them;  least of all by strangers. Bruce seemed to take the nurse-disguise as a  personal affront to himself. Then, too, the man was not of his own  army. On the contrary, the scent proclaimed him one of the horde whom  Bruce's friends so manifestly hated--one of the breed that had more  than once fired on the dog.    Diet and equipment and other causes give a German soldier a markedly  different scent, to dogs' miraculously keen nostrils,--and to those of  certain humans,--from the French or British or American troops. War  records prove this. Once having learned the scent, and having learned  to detest it, Bruce was not to be deceived.    For all these reasons he had snarled loathingly at the man in white.  For these same reasons he could not readily forget the incident, but  continued every now and then to glance curiously across toward the  church.    Presently,--not relishing the rebukes of the friends who had heretofore  pestered him by overmuch petting,--the collie arose quietly from his  couch of trampled earth at the foot of the stone bench and strolled  back across the street. Most of the men were too busy, talking, to note  Bruce's departure. But Sergeant Mahan caught sight of him just as the  dog was mounting the last of the steps leading into the church.    As a rule, when Bruce went investigating, he walked carelessly and with  his tail slightly a-wag. Now his tail was stiff as an icicle, and he  moved warily, on the tips of his toes. His tawny-maned neck was low.  Mahan, understanding dogs, did not like the collie's demeanor.  Remembering that the nurse had entered the church a few minutes  earlier, the Sergeant got to his feet and hastily followed Bruce.    The dog, meanwhile, had passed through the crazily splintered doorway  and had paused on the threshold of the improvised hospital, as the reek  of iodoform and of carbolic smote upon his sensitive nostrils. In front  of him was the stone-paved vestibule. Beyond was the interior of the  shattered church, lined now with double rows of cots.    Seated on a camp-chair in the shadowy vestibule was the pseudo Red  Cross nurse. At sight of the collie the nurse got up in some haste.  Bruce, still walking stiff-legged, drew closer.    Out from under the white skirt flashed a capable and solidly-shod foot.  In a swinging kick, the foot let drive at the oncoming dog. Before  Bruce could dodge or could so much as guess what was coming,--the kick  smote him with agonizing force, square on the shoulder.    To a spirited collie, a kick carries more than the mere pain of its  inflicting. It is a grossly unforgivable affront as well--as many a  tramp and thief have learned, at high cost.    By the time the kick had fairly landed, Bruce had recovered from his  instant of incredulous surprise; and with lightning swiftness he hurled  himself at his assailant.    No bark or growl heralded the murderous throatlunge. It was all the  more terrible for the noiselessness wherewith it was delivered. The  masquerading man saw it coming, just too late to guard against it. He  lurched backward, belatedly throwing both hands up to defend his  throat. It was the involuntary backward step which saved his jugular.  For his heel caught in the hem of his white skirt. And wholly off  balance, he pitched headlong to the floor.    This jerky shift of position, on the part of the foe, spoiled Bruce's  aim. His fearful jaws snapped together harmlessly in empty air at a  spot where, a fraction of a second earlier, the other's throat had  been. Down crashed the disguised man. And atop of him the furious dog  hurled himself, seeking a second time the throatgrip he had so narrowly  missed.    At this point on the program Sergeant Mahan arrived just in time to  bury both hands in the mass of Bruce's furry ruff and to drag the  snarlingly rabid dog back from his prey.    The place was in an uproar. Nurses and doctors came rushing out into  the vestibule; sick and wounded men sat up on their cots and eagerly  craned their necks to catch sight of the scrimmage. Soldiers ran in  from the street.    Strong as he was, Mahan had both hands full in holding the frantic  Bruce back from his enemy. Under the insult of the kick from this  masquerader, whom he had already recognized as a foe, the collie had  temporarily lost every vestige of his stately dignity. He was for the  moment merely a wild beast, seeking revenge for a brutal injury. He  writhed and fought in Mahan's grasp. Never once did he seek to attack  the struggling man who held him. But he strained every giant sinew to  get at the foe who had kicked him.    The dog's opponent scrambled to his feet, helped by a dozen willing  hands and accosted by as many solicitous voices. The victim's face was  bone-gray with terror. His lips twitched convulsively. Yet, as befitted  a person in his position, he had a splendid set of nerves. And almost  at once he recovered partial control over himself.    \"I--I don't know how it happened,\" he faltered, his rich contralto  voice shaky with the ground-swells of his recent shock. \"It began when  I was sitting on the steps, sewing. This dog came past. He growled at  me so threateningly that I came indoors. A minute later, while I was  sitting here sewing, he sprang at me and threw me down. I believe he  would--would have killed me,\" the narrator finished, with a very  genuine shudder, \"if I had not been rescued when I was. Such  bloodthirsty brutes ought to be shot!\"    \"He not only OUGHT to be,\" hotly agreed the chief surgeon, \"but he is  GOING to be. Take him out into the street, one of you men, and put a  ball in his head.\"    The surgeon turned to the panting nurse.    \"You're certain he didn't hurt you?\" he asked. \"I don't want a  newcomer, like yourself, to think this is the usual treatment our  nurses get. Lie down and rest. You look scared to death. And don't be  nervous about the cur attacking you again. He'll be dead inside of  three minutes.\"    The nurse, with a mumbled word of thanks, scuttled off into the rear of  the church, where the tumbledown vestry had been fitted up as a  dormitory.    Bruce had calmed down somewhat under Mahan's sharp reproof. But he now  "]]]
