It was said  to be a cold and comfortless land, but it was surely preferable to the  Fleet Prison or the Marshalsea, with the alternative of starvation or  enlistment in the army. Many of these pimps and panders to the whims or  the passions of those in high station found their way to Quebec and  Montreal, and were provided for at the public expense by being installed  in places of greater or less emolument.[45]    When Upper Canada was set apart as a separate Province, in 1791, the  field of operations was considerably extended. Indeed, the Upper  Province soon came to be regarded with special favour by intending  aspirants to office, as it was in all respects an English colony;  whereas Lower Canada, in spite of all attempts to Anglicize it, remained  much more French than English. Lower Canada, indeed, remained in some  respects more French than any other part of the world, not even  excepting France itself, for in that country the Great Revolution had  swept away many effete institutions which were still retained in all  their decrepitude among the Frenchmen of the New World. Now, the French  Canadians, though most of the avenues to power and office were closed to  them, composed a vast majority of the population. They did not take  kindly to the British colonists, and declined to fraternize with them.  The latter could bear this isolation, as they were comforted by the  spoils of office, but their lives were rendered much less agreeable than  they would have been in a colony where no such disturbing elements were  known. Upper Canada was precisely such a colony. No part of Britain was  more British in sentiment. In no part of the world would an expatriated  Englishman find himself more entirely in harmony with his environment,  from a purely patriotic point of view. What wonder, then, that Upper  Canada was regarded by place-hunting emigrants from England with  wistful eyes? What wonder that an appointment to a public office in  Upper Canada should have been regarded by such persons as a thing  greatly to be coveted? Such aspirants were regarded with but little  favour by Governor Simcoe. His great object was to launch the Province  successfully on its career, and to lay the foundations of good  government. He brought with him his own staff, selected by himself with  a single eye to their fitness for the positions which they were  respectively intended to fill. During his day there was little or no  favouritism in public appointments, and but little, if anything, to find  fault with in the conduct of the administration. His demission of office  was almost immediately followed by a relaxation of discipline, and by a  looseness in the management of the public business. As the years passed  by, the Province became the resort of numerous office-seekers from  beyond sea--half-pay officers and scions of good English, Scotch and  Irish families, who sought to better their fortunes by expatriation. As  they were, generally speaking, men of some education, and of manners  more polished than were ordinarily found among the colonists, they  naturally assimilated, and were drawn towards each other. They likewise  coalesced, to some extent, with a few United Empire Loyalist families of  exclusive pretensions, in whose veins the blood was supposed to possess  an exceptionally cerulean tint. Several persons who had rapidly gained  wealth by trade and speculation, and who had thereby acquired influence  in the community, were also admitted. In an inconceivably short space of  time this union of several influential cliques was followed by important  results. They acquired a strength and influence which, in the then  primitive state of the colony, carried all before them. They wormed  themselves into all the more important offices, directed the Councils of  the Sovereign's representative, and, in a word, became the power behind  the Throne. In the early years of their domination they organized their  forces with much tact and judgment, and did not develop their plans  until they had been carefully matured. They may be said to have  practically absorbed the Executive and Legislative Councils, as those  bodies were entirely made up of persons either selected from among them  or entirely subservient to their influence. No man, whatever his  abilities, could hope to succeed in any profession or calling in Upper  Canada if he dared to declare himself in opposition to them. A few made  the attempt, and failed most signally.    Such was the Family Compact. \"For a long time,\" says Lord Durham,[46]  writing in 1838, \"this body of men, receiving at times accessions to its  members, possessed almost all the highest public offices, by means of  which, and of its influence in the Executive Council, it wielded all the  powers of Government; it maintained influence in the Legislature by  means of its predominance in the Legislative Council; and it disposed of  the large number of petty posts which are in the patronage of the  Government all over the Province. Successive Governors, as they came in  their turn, are said to have either submitted quietly to its influence,  or, after a short and unavailing struggle, to have yielded to this  well-organized party the conduct of affairs. The bench, the magistracy,  the high offices of the Episcopal Church, and a great part of the legal  profession, are filled by the adherents of this party: by grant or  purchase they have acquired nearly the whole of the waste lands of the  Province; they are all-powerful in the chartered banks, and, till  lately, shared among themselves almost exclusively all offices of trust  and profit.\"    The influences which produced the Family Compact were not confined to  Upper Canada. In the Lower Province, as well as in Nova Scotia and New  Brunswick, similar causes led to similar results, and the term \"Family  Compact\" has at one time or another been a familiar one in all the  British North American colonies. But in none of them did the  organization attain to such a plenitude of power as in this Province,  and in none of them did it wield the sceptre of authority with so  thorough an indifference to the principles of right and wrong. Its name  is a rather indefinite, but not inapt characterization. Lord Durham  refers to the term \"Family Compact,\" as being not much more appropriate  than party designations usually are; \"inasmuch as,\" he writes, \"there  is, in truth, very little of family connexion among the persons thus  united.[47]\" \"Much\" is a saving clause, but if his Lordship had thought  it worth his while to enquire minutely into the relations subsisting  between the members of this body, he would have found that there had  been a good many intermarriages between them, and that the pecuniary  interests which bound them together had been welded by the most powerful  of social bonds.[48] The designation \"Family Compact,\" however, did not  owe its origin to any combination of North American colonists, but was  borrowed from the diplomatic history of Europe. By the treaty signed at  Paris on the 15th of August, 1761, by representatives on behalf of  France and Spain, the contracting parties agreed to guarantee each  other's territories, to provide mutual succours by sea and land, and to  consider the enemy of either as the enemy of both. This treaty, being  contracted between the two branches of the House of Bourbon, is known to  history as the Family Compact Treaty, and the name was adopted in the  Canadas, as well as in the Maritime Provinces, to designate the  combination which enjoyed a monopoly of power and place in the  community, and among the members whereof there seemed to be a perfect,  if unexpressed, understanding, that they were to make common cause  against any and all persons who might attempt to diminish or destroy  their influence.    The members of the Family Compact, with very few exceptions, were  members of the Church of England, which, owing to the before-mentioned  provisions in the Constitutional Act, they regarded as the State Church  of Upper Canada, established by law, and entitled to the special  veneration of the inhabitants. They accounted all persons as members of  the Church of England who were not actual members of some other  religious body, and in enumerating the people for statistical purposes  they sometimes even went so far as to include the infant children of  Dissenters as Episcopalians. They sought to defend the alleged  establishment of a State Church in Canada by arguments which it is  astonishing to think that men of education and intelligence should ever  have stooped to employ. \"There should be in every Christian country an  established religion,\" said Dr. Strachan, in his evidence before the  Select Committee on Grievances, in 1835, \"otherwise it is not a  Christian but an infidel country.\"[49] According to their theory, one of  the principal ends of the Government of Upper Canada was the propagation  of religious truth as set forth in the doctrines of the Church of  England. True, the arguments on the subject were not so well understood  then as now. Mr. Gladstone's little volume on \"The State in its  Relations with the Church,\" and Macaulay's answer thereto in the  _Edinburgh Review_, had not then been published. But some of the most  conclusive arguments adduced by Macaulay were as old as the world  itself; and even Mr. Gladstone, in all his youthful exuberance, did not  venture to take so preposterous a stand as was assumed by the upholders  of a State Church in this Province. Their bigotry and intolerance were  utterly out of keeping with the times in which they lived, and were  better suited to the days of Archbishop Laud or Sir Robert Filmer. Of  that heaven-born charity which suffereth long, and is kind; which  vaunteth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],[0,"The Book-Hunter (#17)"],[1,"and immunities  conceded by immemorial deference to this stamp of scientific rank. I not  only, however, consider my own trifles unworthy of such a dignity, but  am inclined to strip it from other productions which might appear to  have a more appropriate claim to it. No doubt, the ductile inflections  and wonderful facilities for decomposition and reconstruction make Greek  an excellent vehicle of scientific precision, and the use of a dead  language saves your nomenclature from being confounded with your common  talk. The use of a Greek derivative gives notice that you are  scientific. If you speak of an acanthopterygian, it is plain that you  are not discussing perch in reference to its roasting or boiling merits;  and if you make an allusion to monomyarian malacology, it will not  naturally be supposed to have reference to the cooking of oyster sauce.    Like many other meritorious things, however, Greek nomenclature is much  abused. The very reverence it is held in--the strong disinclination on  the part of the public to question the accuracy of anything stated under  the shadow of a Greek name, or to doubt the infallibility of the man who  does it--makes this kind of nomenclature the frequent protector of  fallacies and quackeries. It is an instrument for silencing inquiry and  handing over the judgment to implicit belief. Get the passive student  once into palaeozoology, and he takes your other hard names--your  ichthyodorulite, trogontherium, lepidodendron, and bothrodendron--for  granted, contemplating them, indeed, with a kind of religious awe or  devotional reverence. If it be a question whether a term is  categorematic, or is of a quite opposite description, and ought to be  described as _sun_categorematic, one may take up a very absolute  positive position without finding many people prepared to assail it.    Antiquarianism, which used to be an easy-going slipshod sort of pursuit,  has sought this all-powerful protection, and called itself Archaeology.  An obliterated manuscript written over again is called a palimpsest, and  the man who can restore and read it a paleographist. The great erect  stone on the moor, which has hitherto defied all learning to find the  faintest trace of the age in which it was erected, its purpose, or the  people who placed it there, seems as it were to be rescued from the  heathen darkness in which it has dwelt, and to be admitted within the  community of scientific truth, by being christened a monolith. If it be  large and shapeless, it may take rank as an amorphous megalith; and it  is on record that the owner of some muirland acres, finding them  described in a learned work as \"richly megalithic,\" became suddenly  excited by hopes which were quickly extinguished when the import of the  term was fully explained to him. Should there be any remains of  sculpture on such a stone, it becomes a lithoglyph or a hieroglyph; and  if the nature and end of this sculpture be quite incomprehensible to the  adepts, they may term it a cryptoglyph, and thus dignify, by a sort of  title of honour, the absoluteness of their ignorance. It were a pity if  any more ingenious man should afterwards find a key to the mystery, and  destroy the significance of the established nomenclature.    The vendors of quack medicines and cosmetics are aware of the power of  Greek nomenclature, and apparently subsidise scholars of some kind or  other to supply them with the article. A sort of shaving soap used  frequently to be advertised under a title which was as complexly  adjusted a piece of mosaic work as the geologists or the conchologists  ever turned out. But perhaps the confidence in the protective power of  Greek designations lately reached its climax, in an attempt to save  thieves from punishment by calling them kleptomaniacs.    It is possible that, were I to attempt to dignify the class of men to  whom the following sketches are devoted by an appropriate scientific  title, a difficulty would start up at the very beginning. As the reader  will perhaps see, from the tenor of my discourse, I would find it  difficult to say whether I should give them a good name or a bad--to  speak more scientifically, and of course more clearly, whether I should  characterise them by a predicate eulogistic, or a predicate dyslogistic.  On the whole, I am content with my first idea, and continue to stick to  the title of \"The Book-Hunter,\" with all the more assurance that it has  been tolerated, and even liked, by readers of the kind I am most  ambitious of pleasing.[23]    [Footnote 23: To afford the reader, however, an opportunity of noting at  a glance the appropriate learned terms applicable to the different sets  of persons who meddle with books, I subjoin the following definitions,  as rendered in D'Israeli's Curiosities, from the Chasse aux  Bibliographes et aux Antiquaires mal avises of Jean Joseph Rive:--    \"A bibliognoste, from the Greek, is one knowing in title-pages and  colophons, and in editions; the place and year when printed; the presses  whence issued; and all the minutiae of a book.\"--\"A bibliographe is a  describer of books and other literary arrangements.\"--\"A bibliomane is  an indiscriminate accumulator, who blunders faster than he buys,  cock-brained and purse-heavy.\"--\"A bibliophile, the lover of books, is  the only one in the class who appears to read them for his own  pleasure.\"--\"A bibliotaphe buries his books, by keeping them under lock,  or framing them in glass-cases.\"    The accurate Peignot, after accepting of this classification with high  admiration of its simplicity and exhaustiveness, is seized in his  supplementary volume with a misgiving in the matter of the bibliotaphe,  explaining that it ought to be translated as a grave of books, and that  the proper technical expression for the performer referred to by Rive,  is bibliothapt. He adds to the nomenclature bibliolyte, as a destroyer  of books; bibliologue, one who discourses about books; bibliotacte, a  classifier of books; and bibliopee, \"_l'art d'ecrire ou de composer des  livres_,\" or, as the unlearned would say, the function of an author. Of  the dignity with which this writer can invest the objects of his  nomenclature, take the following specimen from his description of the  bibliographe:--    \"Nothing is rarer than to deserve the title of bibliographe, and nothing  more difficult and laborious than to attain a just title to it.    \"Bibliography being the most universal and extensive of all sciences, it  would appear that all subjects should come under the consideration of  the bibliographe; languages, logic, criticism, philosophy, eloquence,  mathematics, geography, chronology, history, are no strangers to him;  the history of printing and of celebrated printers is familiar to him,  as well as all the operations of the typographic art. He is continually  occupied with the works of the ancients and the moderns; he makes it his  business to know books useful, rare, and curious, not only by their  titles and form, but by their contents; he spends his life in analysing,  classifying, and describing them. He seeks out those which are  recommended by talented authors; he runs through libraries and cabinets  to increase the sum of his knowledge; he studies authors who have  treated of the science of books, he points out their errors; he chooses  from among new productions those which bear the stamp of genius, and  which will live in men's memories; he ransacks periodicals to keep  himself well up to the discoveries of his age, and compare them with  those of ages past; he is greedy of all works which treat of libraries,  particularly catalogues, when they are well constructed and well  arranged, and their price adds to their value. Such is the genuine  _Bibliographe_.\" This reminds one of the old Roman jurists, who briefly  defined their own science as the knowledge of things human and divine.]    Few wiser things have ever been said than that remark of Byron's, that  \"man is an unfortunate fellow, and ever will be.\" Perhaps the  originality of the fundamental idea it expresses may be questioned, on  the ground that the same warning has been enounced in far more solemn  language, and from a far more august authority. But there is originality  in the vulgar everyday-world way of putting the idea, and this makes it  suit the present purpose, in which, a human frailty having to be dealt  with, there is no intention to be either devout or philosophical about  it, but to treat it in a thoroughly worldly and practical tone, and in  this temper to judge of its place among the defects and ills to which  flesh is heir. It were better, perhaps, if we human creatures sometimes  did this, and discussed our common frailties as each himself partaking  of them, than that we should mount, as we are so apt to do, into the  clouds of theology or of ethics, according as our temperament and  training are of the serious or of the intellectual order. True, there  are many of our brethren violently ready to proclaim themselves frail  mortals, miserable sinners, and no better, in theological phraseology,  than the greatest of criminals. But such has been my own unfortunate  experience in life, that whenever I find a man coming forward with these  self-denunciations on his lips, I am prepared for an exhibition of  intolerance, spiritual pride, and envy, hatred, malice, and all  uncharitableness, towards any poor fellow-creature who has floundered a  little out of the straight path, and being all too conscious of his  errors, is not prepared to proclaim them in those broad emphatic terms  which come so readily to the lips of the censors, who at heart believe  themselves spotless,--just as complaints about poverty, and inability to  buy this and that, come from the fat lips of the millionaire, when he  shows you his gallery of pictures, his stud, and his forcing-frames.    No; it is hard to choose between the two. The man who has no"]]]
