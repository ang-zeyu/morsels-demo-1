Impossible to entrust the kind of letter she wished  to write to any mode of delivery so public--especially now, when  her movements were watched. To open and read another's letters is a  low and dastardly act, but she believed that Lady Caroline would do  it like a shot. She longed to pour out her heart to Geoffrey in a  long, intimate letter, but she did not dare to take the risk of  writing for a wider public. Things were bad enough as it was, after  that disastrous sortie to London.    At this point a soothing vision came to her--the vision of George  Bevan knocking off her brother Percy's hat. It was the only  pleasant thing that had happened almost as far back as she could  remember. And then, for the first time, her mind condescended to  dwell for a moment on the author of that act, George Bevan, the  friend in need, whom she had met only the day before in the lane.  What was George doing at Belpher?  His presence there was  significant, and his words even more so. He had stated explicitly  that he wished to help her.    She found herself oppressed by the irony of things. A knight had  come to the rescue--but the wrong knight. Why could it not have  been Geoffrey who waited in ambush outside the castle, and not a  pleasant but negligible stranger? Whether, deep down in her  consciousness, she was aware of a fleeting sense of disappointment  in Geoffrey, a swiftly passing thought that he had failed her, she  could hardly have said, so quickly did she crush it down.    She pondered on the arrival of George. What was the use of his  being somewhere in the neighbourhood if she had no means of knowing  where she could find him? Situated as she was, she could not wander  at will about the countryside, looking for him. And, even if she  found him, what then? There was not much that any stranger, however  pleasant, could do.    She flushed at a sudden thought. Of course there was something  George could do for her if he were willing. He could receive,  despatch and deliver letters. If only she could get in touch with  him, she could--through him--get in touch with Geoffrey.    The whole world changed for her. The sun was setting and chill  little winds had begun to stir the lily-pads, giving a depressing  air to the scene, but to Maud it seemed as if all Nature smiled.  With the egotism of love, she did not perceive that what she  proposed to ask George to do was practically to fulfil the humble  role of the hollow tree in which lovers dump letters, to be  extracted later; she did not consider George's feelings at all. He  had offered to help her, and this was his job. The world is full of  Georges whose task it is to hang about in the background and make  themselves unobtrusively useful.    She had reached this conclusion when Albert, who had taken a short  cut the more rapidly to accomplish his errand, burst upon her  dramatically from the heart of a rhododendron thicket.    \"M'lady! Gentleman give me this to give yer!\"    Maud read the note. It was brief, and to the point.        \"I am staying near the castle at a cottage they call 'the      one down by Platt's'. It is a rather new, red-brick place.      You can easily find it. I shall be waiting there if you want      me.\"    It was signed \"The Man in the Cab\".    \"Do you know a cottage called 'the one down by Platt's', Albert?\"  asked Maud.    \"Yes, m'lady. It's down by Platt's farm. I see a chicken killed  there Wednesday week. Do you know, m'lady, after a chicken's 'ead  is cut orf, it goes running licketty-split?\"    Maud shivered slightly. Albert's fresh young enthusiasms frequently  jarred upon her.    \"I find a friend of mine is staying there. I want you to take a  note to him from me.\"    \"Very good, m'lady.\"    \"And, Albert--\"    \"Yes, m'lady?\"    \"Perhaps it would be as well if you said nothing about this to any  of your friends.\"    In Lord Marshmoreton's study a council of three was sitting in  debate. The subject under discussion was that other note which  George had written and so ill-advisedly entrusted to one whom he  had taken for a guileless gardener. The council consisted of Lord  Marshmoreton, looking rather shamefaced, his son Percy looking  swollen and serious, and Lady Caroline Byng, looking like a tragedy  queen.    \"This,\" Lord Belpher was saying in a determined voice, \"settles it.  From now on Maud must not be allowed out of our sight.\"    Lord Marshmoreton spoke.    \"I rather wish,\" he said regretfully, \"I hadn't spoken about the  note. I only mentioned it because I thought you might think it  amusing.\"    \"Amusing!\" Lady Caroline's voice shook the furniture.    \"Amusing that the fellow should have handed me of all people a  letter for Maud,\" explained her brother. \"I don't want to get Maud  into trouble.\"    \"You are criminally weak,\" said Lady Caroline severely. \"I really  honestly believe that you were capable of giving the note to that  poor, misguided girl, and saying nothing about it.\" She flushed.  \"The insolence of the man, coming here and settling down at the  very gates of the castle! If it was anybody but this man Platt who  was giving him shelter I should insist on his being turned out. But  that man Platt would be only too glad to know that he is causing us  annoyance.\"    \"Quite!\" said Lord Belpher.    \"You must go to this man as soon as possible,\" continued Lady  Caroline, fixing her brother with a commanding stare, \"and do your  best to make him see how abominable his behaviour is.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't!\" pleaded the earl. \"I don't know the fellow. He'd  throw me out.\"    \"Nonsense. Go at the very earliest opportunity.\"    \"Oh, all right, all right, all right. Well, I think I'll be  slipping out to the rose garden again now. There's a clear hour  before dinner.\"    There was a tap at the door. Alice Faraday entered bearing papers,  a smile of sweet helpfulness on her pretty face.    \"I hoped I should find you here, Lord Marshmoreton. You promised to  go over these notes with me, the ones about the Essex branch--\"    The hunted peer looked as if he were about to dive through the  window.    \"Some other time, some other time. I--I have important matters--\"    \"Oh, if you're busy--\"    \"Of course, Lord Marshmoreton will be delighted to work on your  notes, Miss Faraday,\" said Lady Caroline crisply.  \"Take this  chair. We are just going.\"    Lord Marshmoreton gave one wistful glance through the open window.  Then he sat down with a sigh, and felt for his reading-glasses.        CHAPTER 10.    Your true golfer is a man who, knowing that life is short and  perfection hard to attain, neglects no opportunity of practising  his chosen sport, allowing neither wind nor weather nor any  external influence to keep him from it. There is a story, with an  excellent moral lesson, of a golfer whose wife had determined to  leave him for ever. \"Will nothing alter your decision?\" he says.  \"Will nothing induce you to stay? Well, then, while you're packing,  I think I'll go out on the lawn and rub up my putting a bit.\"  George Bevan was of this turn of mind. He might be in love; romance  might have sealed him for her own; but that was no reason for  blinding himself to the fact that his long game was bound to suffer  if he neglected to keep himself up to the mark. His first act on  arriving at Belpher village had been to ascertain whether there was  a links in the neighbourhood; and thither, on the morning after his  visit to the castle and the delivery of the two notes, he repaired.    At the hour of the day which he had selected the club-house was  empty, and he had just resigned himself to a solitary game, when,  with a whirr and a rattle, a grey racing-car drove up, and from it  emerged the same long young man whom, a couple of days earlier, he  had seen wriggle out from underneath the same machine. It was  Reggie Byng's habit also not to allow anything, even love, to  interfere with golf; and not even the prospect of hanging about the  castle grounds in the hope of catching a glimpse of Alice Faraday  and exchanging timorous words with her had been enough to keep him  from the links.    Reggie surveyed George with a friendly eye. He had a dim  recollection of having seen him before somewhere at some time or  other, and Reggie had the pleasing disposition which caused him to  rank anybody whom he had seen somewhere at some time or other as a  bosom friend.    \"Hullo! Hullo! Hullo!\" he observed.    \"Good morning,\" said George.    \"Waiting for somebody?\"    \"No.\"    \"How about it, then? Shall we stagger forth?\"    \"Delighted.\"    George found himself speculating upon Reggie. He was unable to  place him. That he was a friend of Maud he knew, and guessed that  he was also a resident of the castle. He would have liked to  question Reggie, to probe him, to collect from him inside  information as to the progress of events within the castle walls;  but it is a peculiarity of golf, as of love, that it temporarily  changes the natures of its victims; and Reggie, a confirmed babbler  off the links, became while in action a stern, silent, intent  person, his whole being centred on the game. With the exception of  a casual remark of a technical nature when he met George on the  various tees, and an occasional expletive when things went wrong  with his ball, he eschewed conversation. It was not till the end of  the round that he became himself again.    \"If I'd known you were such hot stuff,\" he declared generously, as  George holed his eighteenth putt from a distance of ten feet, \"I'd  have got you to give me a stroke or two.\"    \"I was on my game today,\" said George modestly. \"Sometimes I slice  as if I were cutting bread and can't putt to hit a haystack.\"    \"Let me know when one of those times comes along, and I'll take you  on again. I don't know when I've seen anything fruitier than the  way you got out of the bunker at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22345"],[0,"Memoirs of the Private Life, Return, and Reign of Napoleon in 1815, Vol. I (#17)"],[1,"others seemed to wait the result, in order to throw themselves  upon me. When this scene had finished, I endeavoured to bribe Salviti  to turn back, but no; he had given his word of honour to go to  Leghorn, and his word of honour was inviolable. Thus I was conducted  against my will into the trap which I wished to avoid. I was worked up  to the highest pitch of fury and vexation; I foamed with rage and  despair. Thus, thought I, wringing my hands, these ruffians will  deprive me of the reward which I was to obtain for my sufferings.  Alas! the Emperor, the Emperor! so near him--under his eyes--at the  moment that--\"Rascal!\" I cried out to Salviti, \"I will follow you like  your shadow, and sooner than allow myself to be arrested, I will blow  out your brains!\"--Salviti shrugged up his shoulders, and answered,  \"Well and good; but, in the mean time, strip, and dress yourself like  a sailor.\"--\"Why?\"--\"Why! why, because you have no passport, and they  will lock you up.\"--I submitted to this new tribulation. One of the  wretches pulled off a heavy jacket with a hood attached to it, in  which I arrayed myself. A coloured handkerchief, all drenched with  sweat and filthiness, was taken from the neck of another of them, and  tied round mine. A third gave me his woollen cap; and in spite of my  unavoidable disgust, I was compelled to draw it on my head down to my  eyes. My beard, by good luck, did not disgrace my unshaved messmates,  and in order that the colour of my hands might not betray me, I washed  them in the bilge-water which stagnated beneath the flooring of our  boat. More remained to be done: our \"_feuille de bord_\" stated that  our crew consisted of six men: we were seven. It therefore, became  necessary to hide one[32]. We chose him who was the shortest, and the  most slender. He nestled at the end of the boat, and we covered him  with some old mats and sailors' jackets. These preparations being  terminated, I was told to seat myself in the place of a rower, and to  take an oar in my hand; and at night-fall we came into the road of  Leghorn.                       [Footnote 32: As only six were noted in the                     \"_feuille de bord_\" they took an extra sailor, in                     order that there might be six on board after my                     landing, otherwise, on landing, they would have                     been obliged to account for the sailor whom I                     represented.]    Salviti presented his papers. The date was too old[33]. The officers  raised objections: he lost his temper; and by way, both of punishment  and precaution, we were ordered to submit to the lesser quarantine,  that is to say, to remain prisoners in the roads during three days.                       [Footnote 33: The time required for sailing from                     one port to another is pretty well ascertained; if                     this period is exceeded, and no sufficient reason                     can be assigned for the delay, it is assumed that                     the vessel may have touched at some infected port;                     and, by excess of caution, they compel you to                     undergo the lesser quarantine. The lesser                     quarantine is also ordered as a punishment when the                     master of a vessel does not behave with due respect                     and submission to the health officers.]    Salviti came with a sorrowful visage and announced this fresh  misfortune; our vessel tacked about, and we reached our station of  exile.    On the morning of the third day Salviti informed me that, according to  custom, they intended to put an \"inspector of health\" on board of our  vessel, who would pass the night with us, in order to ascertain  whether we were all well. From the person who had brought, or who,  rather, had thrown us our provisions (for all contact is prohibited  under pain of death), he had ascertained the name of our intended  inspector. He was a gamester and a drunkard. Salviti procured cards  and wine; and he assured me that he would manage the inspector in such  a manner as to prevent his taking any notice of me.    As for me, I was not as easy as Salviti. I was afraid lest the  inspector might discover the sailor whom we had hidden, or that he  might guess by my manner, my looks, and my awkwardness, that I was not  really the character which I seemed to be. Besides, a single question  would have ended the matter. I did not understand a single word of  Italian, and I should have betrayed myself either by answering him, or  by remaining silent. It came into my head to counterfeit deafness:  this would excuse me from taking a part in the conversation: and to  make believe that I had a wound in my hand: this would account for my  inactivity, and prevent his observing how little I knew of my  pretended occupation. I drew a few drops of blood, which I smeared  upon some dirty rags, in which I wrapped my hand. Salviti explained my  stratagem to my companions, and their loud peals of laughter explained  to me that they approved of it. The inspector arrived. I kept myself  to myself. Salviti acted his part admirably. So did I: and to my great  delight the evening closed, and nothing disagreeable had happened.  Until this night I had always slept separately from the rest on a  tolerable mattress. But the inspector was now accommodated with my  birth and my bed; and I was compelled to lie on the floor with the  sailors; my head being placed even with the feet of my two next  neighbours. The stench and closeness of the atmosphere of my den drove  the blood into my head, and I thought I should have been suffocated.  Early in the morning my companions began to eat and drink: I kept at a  distance. \"Come here, and eat,\" said Salviti.--\"I can't.\"--\"The  inspector will fancy that you are ill, and that will be enough to give  us another quarantine.\"--I ate. At ten o'clock the health-officers  came near us; and as our inspector made a favourable report, we were  allowed to enter the harbour. I remained on board with one of the  crew, whom I kept as a hostage. The smugglers broke up their cabinet  council about two o'clock; and at three o'clock we quitted our  anchorage. A fair wind filled the sail, and I forgot all my sufferings  and my dangers when I perceived the rock where I was to meet with  Napoleon the Great.    We entered the road of Porto Ferrajo[34], without any difficulty, at  the moment when the cannon fired, announcing that the harbour was  about to close. I heard the French drums sounding the roll: my heart  beat high: I passed the night on the deck of the boat. Notwithstanding  the joy which I felt at my arrival, I could not help indulging in a  certain degree of melancholy, inspired, perhaps, by the silence of the  night, and the aspect of the arid and gloomy mountains which  surrounded me. Ah, how vain is human grandeur! thought I. The air of  that sterile islet is breathed by that incomprehensible man who lately  felt that he had not breathing room in Europe. It is in that humble  hovel that he now dwells with his scanty train of faithful followers;  He whom I have seen in the palace of the Caesars, receiving the homage  and the worship of the most brilliant court in the world; He whom I  have seen sitting covered, whilst eight Kings stood before him with  their hats in their hands. It is over this little tribe alone, not  exceeding the population of a village, that Napoleon the Great is now  doomed to reign! Napoleon the Great! He who endowed the thrones of his  allies with the leavings of his conquests--He who so long was the  master and the terror of the universe!                       [Footnote 34: I had believed, according to the                     statements in the ministerial journals, that the                     sea was covered by French and English ships, by                     which all vessels and passengers, proceeding to the                     island, were intercepted. I did not meet with a                     single ship of this description. The ports were                     placed under a \"surveillance,\" equally brutal and                     tyrannical, but the sea was free. All vessels went                     in and out of Porto Ferrajo without experiencing                     the slightest obstacle.]    The sun rose, and put an end to my musings. My joy was inexpressible  when I recognized on the ramparts those old grenadiers whom I had so  often admired and honoured on the field of battle.    I jumped on shore, and I rushed into the nearest inn for the purpose  of putting off my sailor's dress, and then flying to the palace of  Napoleon. But I had been watched and followed: and the functionaries  despatched by general Cambronne, the Commandant of the town,  immediately appeared to secure me. I tranquillized them, and they  accompanied me to the town-house, where General Bertrand then lodged.  I sent in my name, and the General came out. \"Sir, do you come from  France?\"--\"Yes, Monsieur le Marechal.\"--\"What do you want here?\"--\"I  wish to see the Emperor, and to solicit employment.\"--\"Does the  Emperor know you?\"--\"Yes, Sir, and M. X*** has also given me the  means of proving to the Emperor that I am not unworthy of his  goodness.\"--\"Do you bring us any news from France?\"--\"I do, Monsieur  le Marechal; and I think that the intelligence which I bring is  good.\"--\"Well, Heaven hears you; as for us, we are so wretched--I am  dying with impatience to have a talk with you about France; but I must  inform the Emperor of your arrival. Perhaps he may not be able to see  you immediately. To-day the English corvette[35] is here, and those  people are suspicious of every thing: is it publicly known who you  are?\"--\"It is known that I am a French officer.\"--\"So much the worse;  hide your decorations, hold your tongue, and remain within doors and  rest yourself at your inn. I will send for you.\"--Half an hour"]]]
