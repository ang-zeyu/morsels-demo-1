I was  surprised at the extraordinary change I saw in him. His face, lately so  fair and beautiful, was become like a coarse spot of earth, all full of  furrows. That gave me the curiosity to view myself. I felt shocked, for  I saw that God had ordered the sacrifice in all its reality.    Some things fell out by the contrariety of my mother-in-law that caused  me severe crosses. They put the finishing stroke to my son's face.  However, my heart was firm in God, and strengthened itself by the  number and greatness of my sufferings. I was as a victim incessantly  offered upon the altar, to HIM who first sacrificed Himself for love.  \"What shall I render to the Lord, for all his benefits toward me? I  will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.\"  These words, I can truly say, O my God, have been the delight of my  heart, and have had their effect on me, through my whole life; for I  have been continually heaped with thy blessings and thy cross. My  principal attraction, besides that of suffering for Thee, has been to  yield myself up without resistance, interiorly and exteriorly, to all  Thy divine disposals. These gifts which I was favored with from the  beginning, have continued and increased until now Thou hast Thyself  guided my continual crosses, and led me through paths impenetrable to  all but thee.    They sent me pomatums to recover my complexion, and to fill up the  hollows of the smallpox. I had seen wonderful effects from it upon  others, and therefore at first had a mind to try them. But, jealous of  God's work, I would not suffer it. There was a voice in my heart which  said, \"If I would have had thee fair, I would have left thee as thou  wert.\" I was therefore obliged to lay aside every remedy, and to go  into the air, which made the pitting worse; to expose myself in the  street when the redness of the smallpox was at the worst, in order to  make my humiliation triumph, where I had exalted my pride.    My husband kept to his bed almost all that time, and made good use of  his indisposition. Only as he now lost that, which before gave him so  much pleasure in viewing me, he grew much more susceptible to  impressions which any gave him against me. In consequence of this, the  persons who spoke to him to my disadvantage, finding themselves now  better hearkened to, spoke more boldly and more frequently.    There was only Thou, O my God, who changed not for me. Thou didst  redouble my interior graces, in proportion as Thou didst augment my  exterior crosses.          CHAPTER 16      My maid became every day more haughty. Seeing that her scoldings and  outcries did not now torment me, she thought, if she could hinder me  from going to the communion, she would give me the greatest of all  vexations.    She was not mistaken, O divine Spouse of pure souls, since the only  satisfaction of my life was to receive and to honor Thee. I gave  everything, of the finest I had, to furnish the churches with  ornaments, and contributed to the utmost extent of my abilities, to  make them have silver plates and chalices.    \"Oh, my Love,\" I cried, \"let me be thy victim! Spare nothing to  annihilate me.\" I felt an inexpressible longing to be more reduced, and  to become, as it were, nothing.    This girl then knew my affection for the holy sacrament, where, when I  could have liberty for it, I passed several hours on my knees. She took  it in her head to watch me daily. When she discovered me going, she ran  to tell my mother-in-law and my husband. There needed no more to  chagrin them. Their invectives lasted the whole day. If a word escaped  me in my own justification, it was enough to make them say that I was  guilty of sacrilege, and to raise an outcry against all devotion. If I  made them no answer at all, they still heightened their indignation,  and said the most grating things they could devise. If I fell sick,  which often happened, they took occasion to come to quarrel with me at  my bed, saying, my communion and prayers were what made me sick. They  spoke as if there had been nothing else could make me ill, but my  devotion to Thee, O my Beloved!    She told me one day that she was going to write to my director to get  him to stop me from going to the communion. When I made no answer, she  cried out as loud as she could, that I treated her ill and despised  her. When I went to prayers, (though I had taken care to arrange  everything about the house) she ran to tell my husband that I was going  and had left nothing in order. When I returned home his rage fell on me  in all its violence. They would hear none of my reasons, but said,  \"they were all a pack of lies.\" My mother-in-law persuaded my husband  that I let everything go to wreck. If she did not take the care of  things he would be ruined. He believed it, and I bore all with  patience, endeavoring, as well as I could, to do my duty. What gave  most trouble was the not knowing what course to take; for when I  ordered anything without her, she complained that I showed her no  respect, that I did things of my own head and that they were done  always the worse for it. Then she would order them contrary. If I  consulted her to know what, or how she would have anything to be done,  she said that I compelled her to have the care and trouble of  everything.    I had scarcely any rest but what I found in the love of Thy will, O my  God, and submission to Thy orders, however rigorous they might be. They  incessantly watched my words and actions, to find occasion against me.  They chided me all the day long, continually repeating, and harping  over and over the same things, even before the servants. How often have  I made my meals on my tears, which were interpreted as the most  criminal in the world! They said, I would be damned; as if the tears  would open Hell for me, which surely they were more likely to  extinguish. If I recited anything I had heard, they would render me  accountable for the truth of it. If I kept silence, they taxed me with  contempt and perverseness; if I knew anything without telling it, that  was a crime; if I told it, then they said I had forged it. Sometimes  they tormented me for several days successively, without giving me any  relaxation. The girls said, \"I ought to feign sickness, to get a little  rest.\" I made no reply. The love of God so closely possessed me, that  it would not allow me to seek relief by a single word, or even by a  look. Sometimes I said in myself, \"Oh, that I had but any one who could  take notice of me, or to whom I might unburden myself,--what a relief  it would be to me!\" But it was not granted me.    Yet, if I happened to be for some days freed from the exterior cross,  it was a most sensible distress to me, and indeed a punishment more  difficult to bear than the severest trials. I then comprehended what  St. Teresa says, \"Let me suffer or die.\" For this absence of the cross  was so grievous to me, that I languished with desire for its return.  But no sooner was this earnest longing granted, and the blessed cross  returned again, than strange as it may seem, it appeared so weighty and  burdensome, as to be almost insupportable.    Though I loved my father extremely, and he loved me tenderly, yet I  never spoke to him of my sufferings. One of my relations, who loved me  very much, perceived the little moderation they used toward me. They  spoke very roughly to me before him. He was highly displeased, and told  my father of it, adding, that I would pass for a fool. Soon after I  went to see my father, who, contrary to his custom, sharply reprimanded  me, \"for suffering them to treat me in such a manner, without saying  anything in my own defence.\" I answered, \"If they knew what my husband  said to me, that was confusion enough for me, without my bringing any  more of it on myself by replies; that if they did not notice it, I  ought not to cause it to be observed, nor expose my husband's weakness;  that remaining silent stopped all disputes, whereas I might cause them  to be continued and increased by my replies.\" My father answered that I  did well, and that I should continue to act as God should inspire me.  And after that, he never spoke to me of it any more.    They were ever talking to me against my father, against my relations,  and all such as I esteemed most. I felt this more keenly than all they  could say against myself. I could not forbear defending them, and  therein I did wrong; as whatever I said served only to provoke them. If  any complained of my father or relations, they were always in the  right. If any, whom they had disliked before, spoke against them, they  were presently approved of. If any showed friendship to me, such were  not welcome. A relation whom I greatly loved for her piety, coming to  see me, they openly bid her begone. They treated her in such a manner  as obliged her to go, which gave me no small uneasiness. When any  person of distinction came, they would speak against me; even to those  who knew me not, which surprised them. But when they saw me they pitied  me.    It mattered not what they said against me, love would not allow me to  justify myself. I spoke not to my husband of what either my  mother-in-law or the girl did to me, except the first year, when I was  not sufficiently touched with the power of God to suffer. My  mother-in-law and my husband often quarrelled. Then I was in favor, and  to me they made their mutual complaints. I never told the one what the  other had said. And though it might have been of service to me, humanly  speaking, to take advantage of such opportunities, I never made use of  them to complain of either. Nay, on the contrary, I did not rest till I  had reconciled them. I spoke many obliging things of the one to the  other, which made them friends again. I knew by frequent experience  that I should pay dear for their reunion.

I think it is Emerson who says that there are quantities of  people who are always trying to become settled, whereas our only  salvation consists in being constantly unsettled. I think the English  women are infinitely braver and finer in their attitude on the suffrage  question than we are. What I feel, Dr. Earl, is this: we have come to a  time when nothing is really worth while unless it is worth fighting for.  There are other worth while things, of course, for the laboratory man or  woman, but for those of us who are in the thick of the fight, who want  to do things _now_, it is necessary that we should be willing to do  battle for our beliefs.\"    \"But is that the way to win?\" asked the doctor. \"We've all heard about  catching flies with molasses, to use a homely simile.\"    \"Yes,\" responded Silvia; \"the more molasses the more flies. No, the old  methods are gone or are going. Do you suppose anything would do the  suffrage cause as much good in this country as clubbing a few old women  who want respectfully to present a petition to the other old women in  Congress? A few years ago a petition was presented, signed by a million  women, and a jocose member rolled it down the aisle with his foot,  saying it might as well be signed by mice! But just let them try the  English methods and every State in the Union would enfranchise its women  just as soon as they could get a popular vote on it.\" She stopped short.  \"Oh, I beg your pardon, doctor, I didn't mean to give you a suffrage  lecture.\"    \"You are not,\" he said. \"At least, what I understand is that you are  trying to make me see that, the spirit of the age is the militant  spirit, that does not wait to have its own presented to it, but takes it  wherever it finds it.\" She nodded and he went on: \"I think that is true,  but with this difference between the illustration you cite and the case  in point. You women must be passionate enthusiasts to win, because the  thing you want is concrete and imminent and personal. I have no  intention of setting up as a _vade mecum_, founding a new cult,  proselyting or even preaching my own doctrines; in the first place I  shall change them as I discover better ones, or when they fail to bring  results, and in the second I shall be too busy practicing my theories to  find time to exploit them.\"    \"There you are wrong,\" said his sister. \"When a man like Jenner comes  along that is the time for practicing, but when smallpox has been rooted  out and tuberculosis forgotten, men will still read what Socrates had to  say of immortality and the sermon on the mount. When you hear people  belittle the written and the spoken Word, it becomes us to remember that  'In the beginning the Word was God,' and all that we know of past  civilizations is the word they have left behind, painted on their stony  walls or burned in a brick to say, 'After me cometh a builder. Tell him  I too have known.'\"    \"But, my dear sister,\" Jack answered, \"don't you think assuming the role  of the teacher may be just a trifle, only a trifle, presumptuous on my  part?\"    \"I don't quite know what your new views are,\" she answered.    \"They are not new,\" he said. \"In fact they are most of them of such  hoary antiquity that they are lost in the mists that brooded over the  face of the deep. It is only the application that is new. Even that has  always been understood by certain great souls. Pythagoras is said to  have taught the Greeks to believe in metempsychosis for the purpose of  making them kinder to lesser forms of life; like many beauty worshipers  they were frankly inhuman, and it took heroic measures to create even a  glimmering perception of the unity of life which is the basis of all the  great world religions, whether it be Buddha's 'Who hurteth another  hurteth himself,' or Christ's commandment, 'Love one another'; the Yogi  looking first at the prince and then at the pauper and saying, 'I am  that,' or Father Damien going into voluntary exile for the sake of the  souls of the wretched lepers. The Prince of Peace preached the doctrine  of spiritual inspiration, and the King of Conquerors said 'Imagination  rules the world.' Jesus or Napoleon--both knew that back of the visible  man himself is the thought of the man, which controls him, and other men  through him, if it possesses power and vitality and truth.\"    \"Then it is a kind of new thought?\" asked Hilda.    \"Rather a renaissance of old thought. The modern quest of the Grail is  not for the crystal cup that held the holy elements, but for the divine  life itself, the principle that inspires men to action. The philosopher  of our day is not a hermit, theorizing about vague abstractions, but  vitally alive to the problems that confront this day and generation, and  modern psychology is changing all the methods of the great processes of  existence. Education, medicine, law, are all in process of  transformation. Grandsons of the men who denounced Mesmer as a charlatan  thronged the clinics of Charcot.\"    \"Yes,\" said Silvia, \"and within the next decade Muensterberg will have  compelled a complete remodeling of our forms of legal procedure. No  attorney worth his salt would undertake to ignore the apparatus devised  by the psychologist, and the time is nearly gone by when, as he says,  courts will prefer to listen to the 'science' of the handwriting  experts, rather than permit the examination of a witness by methods in  accord with the exact work of the psychologist.\"    \"That is true,\" assented Jack, \"and not the least gratifying part of the  whole matter is that it isn't the unimportant who are the ones to speak  respectfully of the changing ideal; in fact, the smaller a man's  calibre the more sure you can be that he will cling to the established  order. It is only very great men who have the courage of their  intuitions long enough to prove them. Muensterberg can afford to say what  he thinks. Now if I go to this meeting and tell these men that 'there  are cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith  exists in its coming,' what do you think they will say?\"    Hilda smiled. \"Most of them will suspect you of quoting 'Science and  Health.' If they accuse you of it, read them the rest of the paragraph.\"    \"What is it?\" asked Silvia eagerly.    \"I can find it in a moment,\" said Hilda, going to the bookshelves, and  taking down a modest olive-colored volume. \"Here it is. 'And where faith  in a fact can help create the fact, that would be an insane logic which  should say that faith running ahead of scientific evidence is the lowest  kind of immorality into which a thinking being can fall. Yet such is the  logic by which our scientific absolutists pretend to regulate our  lives.' That is from the late Professor James, who is said to have been  the profoundest thinker this country has ever produced, and he has said  much more equally startling to those little minds that, like full  bottles, have no room for more.\"    Dr. Earl threw back his head and laughed; his quandary was over, his  course settled. He turned to Silvia with a genial smile. \"Score one more  victory for the Feminists,\" he said. \"I wonder if there ever has been a  time, anywhere on earth, where women were actually and aggressively  noncombatants. The Spartan woman handing over her husband's shield is  typical. Whenever and wherever there has been a cause worth fighting  for, worth dying for--always and forever we can see the figure of the  woman, shield on arm and javelin in hand, standing at the door of the  slothful warrior's tent, calling him to action. Sometimes the eternal  feminine leads on, but very frequently, I regret to say, it has to get  back and drive, and sometimes if it did not kneel and push I fear the  wheels of progress would not revolve at all; that we do go on, slowly  and uncertainly, it is true, but that we go on at all, is due to the  woman soul that will not let us waste our years in the wilderness when  the land of promise is so near at hand. Ladies, I go!\"    He rose as if to make good his words, but Hilda entered a peremptory  negative, and it ended by his staying to dinner and spending a long and  utterly delightful evening, which became in a sense the beginning of  what he felt was a new epoch in his life. This was the understanding,  the fellowship, the _bon camaraderie_ that gives existence its zest and  permits one to dream of life eternal without a horror of impending  weariness and boredom.          CHAPTER XV    AN EVIL PROPHECY BEGINS TO BEAR FRUIT      Leonora and Mrs. Kimball accompanied Dr. Earl to the meeting of the  medical society, and if he had some doubts whether or not she would be  able to follow his discourse perfectly, he had none whatever as to his  own pride and pleasure in her dainty loveliness. She was gowned in  white, and the season's styles were particularly becoming to her  graceful and well-rounded figure. Her radiant face with its sensitive  coloring resembled the delicate glow of one of those rare Sevres vases  of the Empire Period.    She appreciated the compliment of the invitation, as people always  appreciate the compliment of being invited to distinguished gatherings  where the subjects of discussion are likely to be much beyond their  range of knowledge or understanding.    There was a large attendance, for while many members of the profession  had come from idle curiosity, most of those present were interested in  the views of any man of standing who might throw new light upon the  successful application of either medical or surgical remedies.
