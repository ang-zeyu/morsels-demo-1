They moved in  procession about the church, bearing torches in their hands, and keeping  time to beautiful chants from an invisible choir.    [Illustration: FIG. 44.--SAINT CECILIA LISTENING TO THE SINGING OF ANGELS.  _By Raphael._]    Raphael left two hundred and eighty-seven pictures and five hundred and  seventy-six studies and drawings, and all done in so short a life. In  considering him and the story of his life, we find that it was not any one  trait or talent that made his greatness; but it was the rare union of  gifts of genius with a personal charm that won all hearts to him. His  famous picture of \"St. Cecilia,\" with its sweetness of expression and  lovely color--its union of earthly beauty with spiritual feeling, is a  symbol of the harmonious and varied qualities of this prince of painters  (Fig. 44).    GIULIO ROMANO (1492-1556) was the favorite pupil of Raphael, and the heir  of a part of his estate; but his remaining works would not repay us for a  study of them.    Of course, the influence of so great a master as Raphael was felt outside  of his own school, and, in a sense, all Italian art of his time was  modified by him. His effect was very noticeable upon a Sienese painter,  BAZZI, or RAZZI, called IL SODOMA (1477-1549), who went to Rome and was  under the immediate influence of Raphael's works. He was almost unrivalled  in his power to represent beautiful female heads.    His important works were frescoes, many of which are in the churches of  Siena. Doubtless Bazzi was lost in the shadow of the great Raphael, and  had he existed at a time a little more distant from that great man, he  would have been more famous in his life.    During the sixteenth century the Venetian school reached its highest  excellence. The great difference between it and the school of Florence  was, that the latter made beauty of form the one object of its art, while  the Venetian painters combined with grace and ease the added charm of  rich, brilliant color.    GIORGIO BARBARELLI, called GIORGIONE (1477-1511), was the first great  artist of Venice who cast off the rigid manner of the Bellini school, and  used his brush and colors freely, guided only by his own ideas, and  inspired by his own genius.    He was born at Castelfranco, and was early distinguished for his personal  beauty. Giorgione means George the Great, and this title was given him on  account of his noble figure. He was fond of music, played the lute well,  and composed many of the songs he sang; he had also an intense love of  beauty--in short, his whole nature was full of sentiment and harmony, and  with all these gifts he was a man of pure life. Mrs. Jameson says of him:  \"If Raphael be the Shakspeare, then Giorgione may be styled the Byron of  painting.\"    There is little that can be told of his life. He was devoted to his art,  and passionately in love with a young girl, of whom he told one of his  artist friends, Morto da Feltri. This last proved a traitor to Giorgione,  for he too admired the same girl, and induced her to forsake Giorgione,  and go away with him. The double treachery of his beloved and his friend  caused the painter such grief that he could not overcome his sadness, and  when the plague visited Venice in 1511, he fell a victim to it in the very  flower of his age.    Much of the work of Giorgione has disappeared, for he executed frescoes  which the damp atmosphere of Venice has destroyed or so injured that they  are of no value. His smaller pictures were not numerous, and there is much  dispute as to the genuineness of those that are called by his name. He  painted very few historical subjects; his works are principally portraits,  sibyls, and religious pictures. Among the last, the altar-piece at  Castelfranco holds the first place; it represents the Virgin and Child  between Sts. Francis and Liberale, and was painted before 1504.    Giorgione gave an elevated tone to his heads and figures; it seemed as if  he painted only the beings of a superior race, and as if they must all be  fitted to do great deeds. His fancy was very fruitful, and in some of his  works he pictured demons, sea-monsters, dogs, apes, and such creatures  with great effect. In clearness and warmth of color Giorgione is at the  head of the Venetian painters; in truth, it seems as if the color was  within them and showed itself without in a deep, luminous glow.    The most important of Giorgione's scholars was called FRA SEBASTIANO DEL  PIOMBO; his real name was _Luciani_, and he was a native of Venice  (1485-1547). This artist excelled in his coloring and in the effect he  gave to the atmosphere of his work, making it a broad _chiaro-scuro_, or  clear-obscure, as it really means. This is an art term which is frequently  used, and denotes a sort of mistiness which has some light in it, and is  gradually shaded off, either into a full light or a deep shadow. But from  the earliest efforts of this artist, it was plain that he had no gift of  composition, neither could he give his pictures an elevated tone or  effect. For this reason his portraits were his best works, and these were  very fine.    A portrait of his in the National Gallery, London, and another in the  Staedel Gallery at Frankfort, are both said to be of Giulia Gonzaga, the  most beautiful woman of her day in Italy. In 1553, Ippolito de Medici, who  was madly in love with her, sent Sebastian with an armed force to Fondi to  paint her portrait; it was finished in a month, and was said to be the  best ever painted by Sebastian. It was sent to France as a gift to Francis  I., and its present abiding-place is not known.    While Raphael was at the height of his fame in Rome, the banker Chigi  invited Sebastian to that city, and in the Farnesina he painted works  which were very inferior beside Raphael's. Then Sebastian tried to improve  by study under Michael Angelo. This last great master would not compete  with Raphael himself, but he was very jealous of the fame of the younger  man, and it is said that he aided Sebastian, and even made his designs for  him, in the hopes that thus he might eclipse Raphael. We have spoken of  one large picture of the \"Raising of Lazarus\" said to have been made from  Michael Angelo's design, which Sebastian colored; it was painted in  competition with Raphael's Transfiguration, and even beside that most  splendid work the Lazarus was much admired. This is now in the National  Gallery, London.    After Raphael's death Sebastian was called the first painter in Rome, and  was made a _piombatore_. It was necessary to be an ecclesiastic to hold  this office, and it is on account of this that he gave up his real name,  and became a friar. He wrote to Michael Angelo: \"If you were to see me as  an honorable lord, you would laugh at me. I am the finest ecclesiastic in  all Rome. Such a thing had never come into my mind. But God be praised in  eternity! He seemed especially to have thus decreed it. And, therefore, so  be it.\" It is not strange that he should have been so resigned to a high  office and a salary of eight hundred scudi a year!    Another Venetian, of the same time with Giorgione, was JACOPO PALMA,  called IL VECCHIO, or the elder (about 1480-1528). He was born near  Bergamo, but as an artist he was a Venetian. We do not know with whom he  studied, and he was not a very great man, nor was he employed by the  state--but he dwelt much in the palaces of noble families and did much  work for them. When he died he left forty-four unfinished paintings.    His female figures are his best works, and one of his fine pictures at  Dresden, called the \"Three Graces,\" is said to represent his daughters.  The work which is usually called his masterpiece is an altar-piece in the  Church of Santa Maria Formosa, in Venice; the St. Barbara in the centre is  very beautiful, and is said to have been painted from his daughter  Violante.    [Illustration: FIG. 45.--PORTRAIT OF TITIAN. _From the etching by Agostino  Caracci._]    The greatest master of the Venetian school is called TITIAN, though his  real name was TIZIANO VECELLI, and sometimes Cadore is added to this,  because of his having been born in that village (1477-1576). His family  was noble and their castle was called Lodore, and was in the midst of a  large estate surrounded by small houses; in one of these last, which is  still preserved, the painter was born.    As a child he was fond of drawing, and so anxious to color his pictures  that he squeezed the juices from certain flowers, and used them as paints.  When but nine years old he was taken to Venice to study, and from this  time was called a Venetian; he is said by some writers to be the first  portrait-painter of the world.    He first studied under Sebastian Zuccato, and then under the Bellini,  where he was a fellow-pupil with Giorgione, and the two became devoted  friends, at the time when they were just coming to be men and were filled  with glad hopes of future greatness. After a time, when Titian was about  thirty years old, the two were employed on the \"Fondaco dei Tedeschi,\" or  the exchange for German merchants in Venice. Here the frescoes of Titian  were more admired than those of Giorgione, and the latter became so  jealous that they ceased to live together, as they had done, and there is  cause for believing that they were never good friends again. But after the  early death of Giorgione, Titian completed the works he had left  unfinished, and, no doubt, sincerely mourned for him.    One of the most celebrated pictures by Titian is the Presentation in the  Temple, which was painted for the Church of the Brotherhood of Charity,  called in Italian \"La Scuola della Carita;\" this church is now the Academy  of Fine Arts in Venice, where the picture still remains.

Austin had not been permitted to have a chance in the lottery  with other soldiers of the Revolution. Consequently Stephen Upson, one  of Georgia's most prominent men at that time, employed his influence  with such effect that a law was passed giving Dabney a valuable lot.  One of the members of the Legislature from Madison County voted for  this law. At the next election the constituents of this member divided  themselves into two parties, one faction indorsing the vote, and the  other denouncing it. Those who denounced the vote did it on the ground  that it was an indignity to white men for a mulatto to be put on an  equality with them in the distribution of the public land, though, as  Governor Gilmer bluntly puts it, not one of them had served his country  so long or so well. Governor Gilmer, from whose writings all facts about  Austin Dabney are taken, tells a very interesting anecdote about him. In  order to collect the pension which the United States Government allowed  on account of his broken thigh, Austin went once a year to Savannah.  Once when he was on his way to draw what was due him, he fell in with  Colonel Wiley Pope, his neighbor, who was also journeying to Savannah.  They were very intimate and social on the road, and until they found  themselves in the streets of Savannah. When they reached the fashionable  part of the city, Colonel Pope observed to his companion that he was  a sensible man, and knew the prejudices that prevented them from  associating together in the city. Austin Dabney replied that he  understood it very well, and with that he checked his horse and fell in  the rear of Colonel Pope after the fashion of a servant following  his master. Their way led them in front of the house of General James  Jackson, who was at that time governor of the State. The governor was  standing in his door at the time. Colonel Pope passed on unrecognized,  but, chancing to glance around, he saw Governor Jackson run from the  house into the street to greet Austin Dabney. The governor seized the  negro's hand, shook it heartily, drew him from his horse, and carried  him into the house, where he remained a welcome guest during his stay in  the city. Colonel Pope (so Governor Gilmer says) used to tell this story  with great glee, but owned that he felt put out when he realized, that,  whilst he was a stranger at a tavern, Austin Dabney was the honored  guest of the governor of the State. The explanation was, that Governor  Jackson had seen Dabney's courage and patriotism tested on the field  of battle, and he knew that beneath the tawny skin of the mulatto there  beat the heart of a true man.    Austin Dabney was always popular with those who knew of his services in  the Revolutionary War. Governor Gilmer says that he was one of the  best Chroniclers of the stirring events of that period. His memory was  retentive, his understanding good, and he had a gift of description  possessed by few. He moved to the land the State had given him, taking  with him the family of the man who had nursed him. He continued to serve  them while he lived, faithful to the end, and when he died left them the  property he had accumulated.          THE YAZOO FRAUD    Some writers on the early history of Georgia have been under the  impression that the speculation known as the Yazoo Fraud had its  beginning in the efforts of General Elijah Clarke and his followers to  settle on the Indian reservation lying west of the Oconee River; but  this is not the case at all. General Clarke's movement was the result  of an enterprise which was aimed against the Spaniards; and, though the  facts have no real connection with the Yazoo speculation, they may  be briefly told here, especially since Stevens, in his \"History of  Georgia,\" turns them all topsy-turvy.    Genet was the first envoy sent to represent the wild and revolutionary  republic of France,--the republic of Robespierre and the Jacobins. He  represented, as well as any man could, the ideas and purposes of those  who had wrought such havoc in France. He was meddlesome, wrong-headed,  unreasonable, and bold with it all. He sailed from France in a  ship which he commanded himself; and instead of going straight to  Philadelphia (then the seat of government), where his business called  him, he landed at Charleston in South Carolina. War was then pending  between France and Spain; and Genet, after landing in Charleston, found  ready sympathizers in the French Huguenots of South Carolina, and indeed  in all those who had fought for American liberty. There were two reasons  why the fiery appeals of Genet to the people of Carolina to take up  arms against Spain were received enthusiastically. One was, that the  Spaniards in Florida had been at constant war with the people of Georgia  and Carolina, and had committed many crimes and depredations. The other  was, that the people felt grateful to France for the aid she had given  the American Colonies in their efforts to shake off the yoke of Great  Britain.    Genet's plan was to raise in this country an army large enough to seize  the Spanish possessions in Florida, and to reconquer Louisiana. For  the reasons stated, Genet found the people enthusiastic in favor of his  enterprise. The enthusiasm was intense. It crossed the Savannah,  and found General Elijah Clarke, with his strong nature and active  sympathies, ready to embrace it. His military prestige in the South  commended him to Genet as the man to lead the military enterprise  against the Spanish settlements in the South. Accordingly he was given  command of the army that was to be raised, and was made a major general  in the French service with a pay of ten thousand dollars.    Having secured a commander whose courage and resources in the field  could be depended on, Genet went from Charleston to Philadelphia  overland, stirring up sympathy for his enterprise and enlisting men. His  success was greater than he had dreamed of. He found but one thing in  his way, and that was the firmness and vigilance of George Washington.  This great man set his face sternly against the project; but such was  the enthusiasm of the people--artfully stirred by Genet, who was as  accomplished as he was unscrupulous,--that a French party was formed.  Genet took advantage of the formation of this party to arouse prejudice  against Washington; and such was his success, that John Adams, who  was afterwards President, says that there was a multitude of men in  Philadelphia ready to drive Washington from the executive chair.    A considerable army was raised, recruits reported to General Clarke from  the Ohio River to the St. Mary's, and everything was ready for action.  At that moment the heavy hand of Washington descended on the enterprise.  The recall of Genet was demanded, the French party went to pieces,  the project collapsed, and Elijah Clarke was left without resources,  surrounded by a considerable force of men who had come at his bidding  to take part in the attack on the Spanish possessions. These men were on  his hands, expecting the fulfillment of promises that had been made to  them. What was to be done? It was at this critical period that the eyes  of General Clarke turned to the Indian reservation west of the Oconee.  He marched his men to these lands, and took possession. He, and those  who engaged in the movement for settling the lands, had risked their  lives for their country on a hundred battlefields. They thought that  the lands that had been claimed by the King belonged to those who had  conquered the King's armies. They were right in principle, but wrong  in action. The lands that had belonged to the King now belonged to  the people, not as individuals, but as a corporate body,--to the whole  people represented by the State government. These principles had not  been made as clear by discussion in General Clarke's day as they have  been made since. He engaged in no speculation. He boldly settled the  lands, and was prepared to boldly hold his position. The settlement was  made in 1794. On the 28th of July, Governor George Matthews issued a  proclamation forbidding the settlement, and likewise directed one of  the judges to issue a warrant for the general's arrest. At the Superior  Court of Wilkes County, Clarke surrendered himself to the judge, who  referred the case to the county justices. These judges made a decision,  setting forth the fact that Elijah Clarke had surrendered himself into  custody; that, being desirous to do speedy justice to the State as well  as to the party charged, they had proceeded to maturely consider the  case; and that after examining the laws of the State, and the treaties  made and laws passed by the United States, they gave it as their  \"decided and unanimous opinion that the said Elijah Clarke be and  is hereby discharged.\" Encouraged by this decision, General Clarke  returned to his settlement with the intention of holding the lands; but  finally both the Federal and the State governments moved against  him, and he abandoned the enterprise. The policy that Clarke began in  settling the Indian lands without regard to the rights of the savage has  since become the policy of the government. It is not a wholesome  policy, nor is it authorized by the moral or civil law; but it has been  unblushingly carried out nevertheless.    The Yazoo Fraud was a far different matter. The very name of it was  foreign to Georgia. It was borrowed from the Indian name of a small  stream which empties itself into the Mississippi River. When the  Colony of Georgia was first settled, the land granted to Oglethorpe was  described as lying along the Savannah River, extending southward along  the coast to the Altamaha, and from the head waters of these rivers  westward to \"the South Seas.\" Afterwards Great Britain changed the line  which he had established."]]]
