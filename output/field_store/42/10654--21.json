[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22784"],[0,"On Laboratory Arts (#17)"],[1,"the tubes must be somewhat corrugated to enable  the rubber to be firmly wired on to them. The best binding wire is the  purest Swedish iron wire, previously annealed in a Bunsen gas flame.    The wire must never be twisted down on the bare rubber, but must  always be separated from it by a tape binding.  By taking this  precaution the wire maybe twisted very much more tightly than is  otherwise possible without cutting the rubber.    The only difficulty in making such a pump as is described lies in the  bending of the heads of the fall tubes.  This bending must be done  with perfect regularity and neatness, otherwise the drops of mercury  will not break regularly, or will break just inside the top of the  fall tube, and so obstruct its entrance that at high vacua no air can  get into the tube at all.    The connections at the head of the fall tubes must also be well put on  and the joints blown out so that the mercury in dropping over the head  is not interfered with by the upper surface of the tube.  However, a  glance at the enlarged diagram will show what is to be aimed at better  than any amount of description.  In preparing the fall tubes it is  generally necessary to join at least two \"canes\" together.  The joint  must be arranged to occur either in the tube leading the mercury to  the head of the fall, or in that part of the fall tube which remains  full of mercury when the highest vacuum is attained.  On no account  must the joint be made at the fall itself (at least not by an  amateur), nor in that part of the fall tube where the mercury falls  freely, particularly at its lower end, where the drops fall on the  head of the column of mercury.    When a high vacuum is attained the efficacy of the pump depends  chiefly on the way in which the drops fall on the head of the column.  If the fall is too long the drops are apt to break up and allow the  small bubble of air to escape up the tube, also any irregularity or  dirt in the tube at this point makes it more easy for the bubbles of  air to escape to the surface of the mercury.    Any pump in which the supply of mercury to the fall tube can be  regulated nicely will pump well until the lowest available pressures  are being attained;  a good pump will then continue to hold the air  bubbles, while a bad one will allow them to slip back [Footnote: For  special methods of avoiding this difficulty see Mr. Ram's book.] ...    Though three fall tubes are recommended, it must not be supposed that  the pump will produce a Crooke's vacuum three times more rapidly than  one fall tube.  Until the mercury commences to hammer in the pump the  three tubes will pump approximately three times faster than one tube,  but as soon as the major portion of the air collected begins to come  from the layer condensed on the glass surface of the tube to be  exhausted and from the electrodes, the rate at which exhaustion will  go on no longer depends entirely on the pump.    In order that bubbles of air may not slip back up the fall tube it is  generally desirable to allow the mercury to fall pretty briskly, and  in this case the capacity of the pump to take air is generally far in  excess of the air supply.  One advantage of having more than one fall  tube is that it often happens that a fall tube gets soiled during the  process of exhaustion and no longer works up to its best performance.  Out of three fall tubes, however, one is pretty sure to be working  well, and as soon as the mercury begins to hammer in the tubes the  supply may be shut off from the two falls which are working least  satisfactorily.    Thus we are enabled to pump rapidly till a high degree of exhaustion  is attained, having practically three pumps instead of one, whereas  when the final stages are reached, and three pumps are only a drawback  in that they increase the mercury flow, the apparatus is capable of  instant modification to meet the new conditions.    The thistle funnels at the head of the fall tubes are made simply by  blowing bulbs and then blowing the heads of the bulbs into wider ones,  and finally blowing the heads of the wider bulbs off by vigorous  blowing.  The stoppers are ground in on the lathe before the tubes are  attached to the fall tubes.  The stoppers require to be at least half  an inch long where they fit the necks, and must be really well ground  in.  The stoppers must first be turned up nicely and the necks ground  out by a copper or iron cone and emery.  The stoppers are rotated on a  lathe at quite a slow speed, say 30 or 40 feet per minute, and the  necks are held against them, as described in the section dealing with  this art.  The stoppers must in this case be finished with \"two  seconds\" emery, and lastly with pumice dust and water (see chapter on  glass-grinding).    Unless the stoppers fit exceedingly well trouble will arise from the  mercury (which is poured into the thistle heads to form a seal) being  forced downwards into the pump by atmospheric pressure.    The joints between the three fall tubes and the single exhaust main  are easily made when the tubes are finally mounted, the hooked nozzle  of the oxygas blow-pipe being expressly made for such work.    It is, on the whole, advisable to make the pump of flint glass, or at  all events the air-trap tube and the fall tubes.  A brush flame from  the larger gas tube of the single blowpipe table is most suitable for  the work of bending the tubes.  The jointing of the long, narrow bore  fall tubes is best accomplished by the oxygas flame, for in this way  the minimum  of irregularity is produced; the blowing tubes will of  course be required for the job, and the narrow tubes must be well  cleaned to begin with.    The air trap is an important though simple part of the pump.  Its  shoulder or fall should stand rather higher than the shoulders of the  fall tubes, so that the mercury may run in a thin stream through a  good Torricellian vacuum before it passes down to the fall tubes.  This is easily attained by regulating the main mercury supply at the  pinch cock situated between the tube from the upper reservoir and the  air-trap tube, the other cocks being almost wide open.    It might be thought that the mercury would tend to pick up air in  passing through the rubber connections to the fall tubes, but I have  not found this to be the case in practice.  There is, of course, no  difficulty in eliminating the rubber connections between the fall  tubes and the mercury supply from the air trap, but it impresses a  greater rigidity on the structure and, as I say, is not in general  necessary.  It must not be forgotten that the mercury always exercises  considerable pressure on the rubber joints, and so there is little  tendency for gas to come out of the rubber.    The thistle funnels at the head of the fall tubes provide a simple and  excellent means of cleaning the fall tubes.  For this purpose some  \"pure\" sulphuric acid which has been boiled with pure ammonium  sulphate is placed in each thistle funnel, and when the fall tube is  dirty the connection to the mercury supply is cut off at the pinch  cock so as to leave the tube between this entry and the head of the  fall tube quite full of mercury, and the sulphuric acid is allowed to  run down the fall tube by raising the stopper.  The fall tube should  be allowed to stand full of acid for an hour or so, after which it  will be found to be fairly clean.    Of course the mercury reservoir thus obtains a layer of acid above the  mercury, and as it is better not to run the risk of any acid getting  into the pump except in the fall tubes, the reservoir is best emptied  from the bottom, by a syphon, if a suitable vessel cannot be procured,  so that clean mercury only is withdrawn.    The phosphorus pentoxide tube is best made as shown simply from a bit  of wide tube, with two side connections fused to the rest of the pump.  It is no more trouble to cut the tube and fuse it up again when the  drying material is renewed than to adjust the drying tube to two fixed  stoppers, which is the alternative.  The practice here recommended is  rendered possible only by the oxygas blow-pipe with hooked nozzle.  The connection between the pump and tube to be exhausted is made  simply by a short bit of rubber tube immersed in mercury.    The phosphorus pentoxide should be pure, or rather free from  phosphorus and lower oxides;  unless this be the case, the vapour  arising from it is apt to soil the mercury in the pump.  The  phosphorus pentoxide is purified by distilling with oxygen over  red-hot platinum black; if this cannot be done, the pentoxide should  at least be strongly heated in a tube, in a current of dry air or  oxygen, before it is placed in the drying tube.    The mercury used for the pump must be scrupulously clean.  It does  not, however, require to have been distilled in vacuo.  It is  sufficient to purify it by allowing it to fall in a fine spray into a  large or rather tall jar of 25 per cent nitric acid and 75 per cent  water.  The mercury is then to be washed and dried by heating to, say,  110 deg. C.  in a porcelain dish.    Exhausting a Roentgen Tube.    With a pump such as has been described there is seldom any advantage  in fusing an extra connection to the vacuum tube so as to allow of a  preliminary exhaustion by means of a water pump.  About half an hour's  pumping may possibly be saved by making use of a water pump.    The tube to be exhausted is washed and dried by careful heating over a  Bunsen burner and by the passage of a current of air.  The exhausting  tube is then drawn down preparatory to sealing off, and the apparatus  placed upon the pump.  It is best held in position by a wooden clamp  supported by a long retort stand.    Exhaustion may proceed till the mercury in the fall tubes commences to  hammer.  At this point the tube must be carefully heated by a Bunsen  flame, the temperature being brought up to, say, 400 deg. C.
