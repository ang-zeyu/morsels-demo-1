His cupidity  was boundless: the _lettres de cachet_ emanated from his office, and he  carried on an execrable trade in them. If any person wished to get rid  of a father, brother, or husband, they only had to apply to M. de la  Vrilliere. He sold the king's signature to all who paid ready money for  it. This man inspired me with an invincible horror and repugnance. For  his part, as I was not disgusting, he contented himself with hating me;  he was animated against me by his old and avaricious mistress, madame  de Langeac, alias Subutin. Langeac could not endure me. She felt that  it was better to be the mistress of Louis XV than that of the _petit la  Vrilliere _, for so her lover was called at court. I knew that she was  no friend of mine, and that her lover sided with the Choiseuls against  me; and was consequently the more delighted to see the little scoundrel  come to receive the order for avenging me. He entered with an air of  embarrassment; and whilst he made me a salute as low as to the king,  this latter, in a brief severe tone, ordered him to send the sieur  Ledoux to Saint Lazare forthwith. He departed without reply, and half an  hour afterwards returned, to say that it was done. The king then said to  him,    \"Do you know this lady?\"    \"No, sire.\"    \"Well, I desire you henceforward to have the greatest consideration for  her as my best friend, and whoever wishes to prove his zeal for me, will  honor and cherish her.\"    The king then invited him to sup with us, and I am sure that during the  whole repast I was the hardest morsel he had to digest.    Some days afterwards I made acquaintance with a person much more  important than the little duke, and destined to play a great part in the  history of France. I mean M. de Maupeou, the late chancellor, who, in  his disgrace, would not resign his charge. M. de Maupeou possessed one  of those firm and superior minds, which, in spite of all obstacles,  change the face of empires. Ardent, yet cool; bold, but reflective; the  clamors of the populace did not astonish, nor did any obstacles arrest  him. He went on in the direct path which his will chalked out. Quitting  the magistracy, he became its most implacable enemy, and after a deadly  combat he came off conqueror. He felt that the moment had arrived for  freeing royalty from the chains which it had imposed on itself. It was  necessary, he has said to me a hundred times, for the kings of France  in past ages to have a popular power on which they could rely for the  overturning of the feudal power. This power they found in the high  magistracy; but since the reign of Louis XIII the mission of the  parliaments had finished, the nobility was reduced, and they became no  less formidable than the enemy whom they had aided in subduing.    \"Before fifty years,\" pursued M. de Maupeou, \"kings will be nothing in  France, and parliaments will be everything.\"    Talented, a good speaker, even eloquent, M. de Maupeou possessed  qualities which made the greatest enterprises successful. He was  convinced that all men have their price, and that it is only to find  out the sum at which they are purchasable.* As brave personally as a  marechal of France, his enemies (and he had many) called him a coarse  and quarrelsome man. Hated by all, he despised men in a body, and jeered  at them individually; but little sensible to the charms of our sex, he  only thought of us by freaks, and as a means of relaxation. This is M.  de Maupeou, painted to the life. As for his person, you know it as well  as I do. I have no need to tell you, that he was little, ugly, and his  complexion was yellow, bordering upon green. It must be owned, however,  that his face, full of thought and intelligence, fully compensated for  all the rest.         *This gentleman would have been an able coadjutor for       Sir Robert Walpole.--Trans.    You know how, as first president of the parliament of Paris, he  succeeded his father as vice-chancellor. At the resignation of the  titular M. de Lamoignon*, the elder Maupeou received his letters of  nomination, and as soon as they were registered, he resigned in favor of  his son. The Choiseuls had allowed the latter to be nominated, relying  on finding him a creature. I soon saw that the Choiseuls were mistaken.         *In September, 1768.  (au.)    It was in the month of October, that Henriette, always my favorite, came  to me with an air of unusual mystery, to say, that a black* and ugly  gentleman wished to see me; that on the usual reply that I was not  visible, he had insisted, and sent, at the same time, a cautiously  sealed note. I took it, opened, and read these words:--     *i.e., black-haired and/or dressed in black (Transcriber)    \"The chancellor of France wishes to have the honor of presenting his  respectful homage to madame la comtesse du Barry.\"    \"Let him come in,\" I said to Henriette.    \"I will lay a wager, madame, that he comes to ask some favor.\"    \"I believe,\" replied I, \"that he is more frequently the solicited than  the solicitor.\"    Henriette went out, and in a few minutes led in, thro' the private  corridors which communicated with my apartment, his highness monseigneur  Rene Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou, chevalier and chancellor of  France. As soon as he entered I conceived a good opinion of him, altho'  I had only seen him walk. His step was firm and assured, like that of a  man confident in the resources of his own talents.    \"Madame la comtesse du Barry,\" he said, \"would have a right to complain  of me, if I did not come and lay my person at her feet. I had the more  impatience to express to her my devotion, as I feared she had been  prejudiced against me.\"    \"How, monseigneur?\"    \"The gate by which I entered the ministry--\"    \"Is not agreeable to me, as being that of my enemies, but I feel assured  that you will not side with them against me.\"    \"Certainly not, madame; it is my wish to give you pleasure in every  thing, and I flatter myself I may merit your friendship.\"    After many other compliments, the Chancellor asked me, with much  familiarity, when my presentation was to take place, and why it had  not yet occurred. I replied, that the delay arose from the intrigues  of Choiseul, and the king shrunk from the discontent of a handful of  courtiers.    \"I am sorry for it,\" said M. de Maupeou; \"in the first place, madame,  because of the interest I take in you, and also because for his majesty,  it would be a means of striking terror into the opposing party. You  know, madame, how annoying parliaments are to all your friends, and  with what bitterness those of Bretagne and Paris, at this moment, are  pursuing the duc d'Aiguillon.\"    \"Do you think,\" I replied with emotion, \"that matters are unfavorable  towards him?\"    \"I hope not, but he must be warmly supported.\"    \"Ah! I will aid him with all my influence. He is no doubt innocent of  the crimes imputed to him.\"    \"Yes, certainly. He has done no other wrong than to defend the authority  of the crown against the enmity of the parliaments.\"    We continued some time to talk of parliaments and parliament men: then  we agreed that M. de Maupeou should see me again, accompanied by the duc  d'Aiguillon, who should have the credit of presenting him, and he left  me with as much mystery as he had entered.    When the king came to see me, I said to him, \"I have made acquaintance  with your chancellor: he is a very amiable man, and I hope that he will  not conduct himself improperly towards me.\"    \"Where did you see him?\"    \"Here, sire, and but a short time since.\"    \"He came then to visit you?\"    \"Yes, in person, that he might obtain the favor of being permitted to  pay his court to me.\"    \"Really what you tell me seems perfectly unaccountable. He has then  burst from the hands of the Choiseuls? It is amusing. Poor Choiseul,  when soliciting for Maupeou, he most tremendously deceived himself.\"    \"At least, sire, you must own that he has given you no fool.\"    \"True. The chancellor is a man full of talents, and I do not doubt but  that he will restore to my crown that power which circumstances have  deprived it of. However, if you see him familiarly, advise him not to  persuade me to extreme measures. I wish all should work for the best,  without violent courses and without painful struggles.\"    These last words proved to me the natural timidity of the king.    \"I knew very well,\" added the king, \"that Maupeou would not prove a man  for the Choiseuls. The main point is, that he should be mine, and I am  content.\"    Louis XV was then satisfied with the chancellor, but he was not equally  so with the comte Jean.    \"I do not like,\" said he to me, \"your Du Barry monkey. He is a  treacherous fellow, who has betrayed his party, and I hope some of these  mornings we shall hear that the devil has wrung his neck.\"        CHAPTER IX      The king of Denmark--The courtesans of Paris--The duc de Choiseul and  the bishop of Orleans--Witty repartees of the king of Denmark--His visit  to madame du Barry--\"The court of king Petaud,\" a satire--Letter of  the duc d'Aiguillon to Voltaire--The duchesse de Grammont  mystified--Unpublished letter of Voltaire's    From this moment, and in spite of all that comte Jean could say  against it, a new counsellor was admitted to my confidence. He was the  chancellor. The duc d'Aiguillon and he were on very good terms, and  these two, with the abbe Teray, of whom I shall speak to you presently,  formed a triumvirate, which governed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#17)"],[1,"ress. As they were all proceeding round the fire for the  fourth time they halted in the west, the choristers safe and the  standing wand bearers formed a double row of four. Then the Yaybaka  began to hoot, the orchestra to play, the choristers to sing, the  whizzer to make his mimic storm, and the wand bearers to dance. The  latter, keeping perfect time with the orchestra, went through a series  of figures not unlike those of a modern quadrille. In our terpsichorean  nomenclature the \"calls\" might have thus been given: \"Forward and back.  Chassez twice. Face partners. Forward and back. Forward and bow. Forward  and embrace. Forward and wave wands at partners,\" &c. When several of  these evolutions had been performed in a graceful and orderly manner,  the choristers rose, and all went singing out at the east.    134. Three times more the same band returned. In the third and fourth  acts the wands were exchanged for great piÃ±on poles (eight to ten feet  long), portions of which they pretended to swallow, as their  predecessors had done with the arrows. (Paragraph 48.) That the simple  and devoted Pueblo Indian does actually, in dances of this character,  thrust a stick far down his gullet, to the great danger of health and  even of life, there is little reason to doubt; but the wily Navajo  attempts no such prodigies of deglutition. A careful observation of  their movements on the first occasion convinced me that the stick never  passed below the fauces, and subsequent experience in the medicine lodge  only strengthened the conviction (paragraph 121).      [Illustration: FIG. 56. The whizzer.]    135. The instrument designated above as the whizzer is a thin, flat,  pointed piece of wood, painted black and sparkling with the specular  iron ore which is sprinkled on the surface; three small pieces of  turquoise are inlaid in the wood to represent eyes and mouth. One  whizzer which I examined was nine inches long, one and three-fourths  inches broad, and about a quarter of an inch thick in the thickest part.  (Fig. 56.) To it was attached a string about two feet long, by means of  which the centrifugal motion was imparted to it. It is called by the  Navajo tsÃ­n-Â¢e`nÃ­`, or groaning stick. It is used among many tribes of  the southwest in their ceremonies. The Navajo chanters say that the  sacred groaning stick may only be made of the wood of a pine tree which  has been struck by lightning.    136. In the _Fourth dance_ there were about thirty choristers, in  ordinary dress, bearing piÃ±on wands; there was a man who shook a rattle,  another who whirled the groaning stick, and there were three principal  dancers, wearing fancy masks and representing characters from the rites  of the klÃ¨dji qaÃ§Ã l or dance of the \"YÃ ybichy.\" These three danced a  lively and graceful jig, in perfect time to the music, with many bows,  waving of wands, simultaneous evolutions, and other pretty motions which  might have graced the spectacular drama of a metropolitan theater. Three  times they left the corral for a moment, and returning varied the dance,  and always varied to improve. The wands they bore were large light  frames of reeds adorned with large eagle plumes.    137. After this there was an interval of nearly an hour, which passed  slowly with those in the corral. Some smoked and gossiped; some listened  to the never ceasing din of the orchestra or joined in the chant; some  brought in wood and replenished the waning fires; some, wrapped in their  serapea, stretched themselves on the ground to catch short naps.    138. _Fifth dance._ It was after midnight when the blowing of a hoarse  buffalo horn announced the approach of those who were to perform the  fifth dance, the tcÃ²hanoai alili or sun show. There were twenty-four  choristers and a rattler. There were two character dancers, who were  arrayed, like so many others, in little clothing and much paint. Their  heads and arms were adorned with plumes of the war eagle, their necks  with rich necklaces of genuine coral, their waists with valuable silver  studded belts, and their loins with bright sashes of crimson silk. One  bore on his back a round disk, nine inches in diameter, decorated with  radiating eagle plumes to represent the sun. The other carried a disk,  six and a half inches in diameter, similarly ornamented, to symbolize  the moon. Each bore a skeleton wand of reeds that reminded one of the  frame of a great kite; it was ornamented with pendant eagle plumes that  swayed with every motion of the dancer. While the whole party was  passing round the fire in the usual manner wands were waved and heads  bowed towards the flames. When it stopped in the west the choristers sat  and sang and the rattler stood and rattled, while the bearers of the sun  and the moon danced at a lively rate for just three minutes. Then the  choristers rose and all sang and danced themselves out of sight.  A second performance of this dance came between the first and second  repetitions of the next show.    139. I have recorded one story (but have heard of another) accounting  for the origin of this dance; it is as follows: When Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni  visited the mountain of BistcÃ gi, the home of EstsÃ n Â¢igÃ¬ni, these  divine beings had for ornaments on their walls the sun and the moon.  When the great mythic dance was given they were among the guests. They  brought their wall decorations, and when the time for their alili came,  they wore the sun and the moon on their backs when they danced.    140. The _Sixth dance_, that of the standing arcs, was both picturesque  and ingenious. The principal performers were eight in number, as usual  with scanty clothing. Their hair fell loose and long over back and  shoulders and each bore in front of him, held by both hands, a wooden  arc, ornamented with eagle plumes. The ends of the arc (which was a full  semicircle) showed tufts of piÃ±on twigs, and they were evidently joined  together by a slender string, which was invisible to the audience.  Besides the eight principal actors, there was a rattler, a bearer of the  groaning stick, and a chorus. While all were making the fourth circuit  of the fire, frequent shouts of \"ÃÃ²he! ÃÃ²he!\" (Englished,  ThÃ²hay--\"Stand! stand!\" or \"Stay! stay!\") were heard, the significance  of which soon became apparent. When they stopped in the west, the eight  character dancers first went through various quadrille-like figures,  such as were witnessed in the third dance, and then knelt in two rows  that faced one another. At a word from the rattler the man who was  nearest to him (whom I will call No. 1) arose, advanced to the man who  knelt opposite to him (No. 2) with rapid, shuffling steps, and amid a  chorus of \"ThÃ²hay! ThÃ²hay!\" placed his arc with caution upon the head of  the latter. Although it was held in position by the friction of the  piÃ±on tufts at each ear and by the pressure of the ends of the arc, now  drawn closer by the subtending string, it had the appearance of standing  on the head without material support, and it is probable that many of  the uninitiated believed that only the magic influence of the  oft-repeated word \"ThÃ²hay\" kept it in position. When the arc was secured  in its place, No. 1 retreated with shuffling steps to his former  position and fell on his knees again. Immediately No. 2 advanced and  placed the arc which he held in his hand on the head of No. 1. Thus each  in turn placed his arc on the head of the one who knelt opposite to him  until all wore their beautiful halo-like headdresses. Then, holding  their heads rigidly erect, lest their arcs should fall, the eight  kneeling figures began a splendid, well timed chant, which was  accentuated by the clapping of hands and joined in by the chorus. When  the chant was done the rattler addressed the arc bearers, warning them  to be careful; so they cautiously arose from their knees and shuffled  with stiffened spines out of the corral, preceded by the choristers.  This dance was repeated after the second performance of the fifth dance.    141. _Seventh dance._ The arc bearers had scarcely disappeared when  another troupe entered the circle, the buffalo horn announcing their  coming. A man with a whizzer led the procession. The choristers, in  ordinary dress, were thirteen in number. The principal dancers were but  two; they wore the usual sash and belt; the uncovered skin was painted  white; they had on long blue woolen stockings of Navajo make and  moccasins. Each bore a slender wand of two triangles of reeds adorned at  the corners with pendant plumes. They saluted the fire as they danced  around it. They halted in the west, where the choristers sat down, and  the two wand bearers danced for three minutes in a lively and graceful  manner, to the music of the whizzer, the rattle, the choristers, and the  drum of the orchestra. These returned twice more, making some variation  in their performance each time. In the second act the rattler brought in  under his arm a basket containing yucca leaves, and a prayer was said to  the sun. It is possible that this dance was but a preliminary part of  the eighth dance, but it must be described as a separate alili.    142. _Eighth dance._ In this there were sixteen performers, in ordinary  Navajo dress. One of these bore the whizzer and led the procession;  another, who came in the center of the line, carried a hewn plank, or  puncheon, about 12 feet long and 4 inches broad, painted with spots and  decorated with tufts of piÃ±on branchlets and with eagle plumes;  immediately behind the bearer of the plank walked a man who had in a  basket an effigy of the sun, formed of a small round mirror and a number  of radiating scarlet plumes. Having walked around the fire as usual, the  whole party gathered in the west in a close circle, which completely  excluded from the sight of the audience the operations of the actors.  Singing, rattling, and cries of \"ThÃ²hay!\" were heard. In a few minutes"]]]
