Only Mother gave it to me on my last birthday. It  doesn't really matter, and of course it can't be helped now.\"    Carmel was vexed, nevertheless, with her own carelessness. The little  bracelet had been a favorite, and she hated to lose it. She missed the  feel of it on her wrist. Her first thought when she woke next morning  was of annoyance at the incident. As she walked down to breakfast in the  coffee-room, the chauffeur was standing by the hall door. He came up at  once, as if he had been expressly waiting for her, and handed her a  small parcel. To her utter surprise it contained the missing bracelet.    \"Johnson!\" she called, for he had turned quickly away. \"Johnson--oh,  where did you find this? Not in the car, surely?\"    \"No, Miss Carmel, it was just where you thought you had left it--in the  field where you had lunch. I got up early and fetched it before  breakfast,\" replied Johnson pausing on the doorstep.    \"You went all that way! How kind of you! Thank you ever so much!\"  exclaimed Carmel, clasping her bangle on her wrist again. \"I can't tell  you how pleased I am to have it!\"    But Johnson, avoiding her eyes, and seeming anxious to get away from her  thanks, was already out of the front door, and half-way across the  courtyard to the garage.    \"I wonder if English men-servants are always as shy as that?\" thought  Carmel. \"An Italian would certainly have waited to let me say 'Thank  you!'\"          CHAPTER X    A Meeting      After a morning in Wells, to look at the Cathedral and other beauty  spots, the party motored on to Glastonbury, where again they called a  halt to look at the Abbey and the Museum. Major Rogers was interested in  the objects which had been excavated from the prehistoric lake dwellings  in the neighborhood, and spent so much time poring over bronze brooches,  horn weaving-combs, flint scrapers, glass rings, and fragments of  decorated pottery that Sheila lost all patience.    \"Is Dad going to spend the whole day in this moldy old museum?\" she  asked dramatically. \"I hate anything B. C.! What does it matter to us  how people lived in pile dwellings in the middle of a lake? To judge  from those fancy pictures of them on the wall there they must have been  a set of uncouth savages. Why can't we drive on to Dawlish, or some  other decent seaside place, instead of poking about in musty cathedrals  and tiresome museums? I'm fed up!\"    \"Now, Sheila, don't be naughty!\" whispered her mother. \"I'm only too  glad to see your father take an interest in anything. I believe he's  enjoying this tour. If you're tired of the museum, go out and look at  the shops until we're ready.\"    \"There aren't any worth looking at in a wretched little country town!\"  yawned Sheila. \"No, I really don't want to go over the Abbey either,  thanks! I shall sit inside the car and write, while you do the  sight-seeing.\"    Major Rogers never hurried himself to suit his daughter's whims, so  Sheila was left to sit in the car, addressing tragic letters and picture  post cards to her friends, and the rest of the party finished examining  the museum, and went to view the ruins of the famous Abbey.    \"If Sheila prefers to stay outside, she can look after the car,\" said  her father, \"and I shall take Johnson in with us. He's an intelligent  fellow, and I'm sure he appreciates the shows. It's rather hard on him  if he never gets the chance to see anything.\"    \"I believe he goes sight-seeing on his own account when he has the  opportunity,\" replied Mrs. Rogers, \"but bring him in, by all means. He  always strikes me as having very refined tastes. I should think he's  trying to educate himself. But he's so reserved, I never can get  anything out of him.\"    \"He seems fond of books,\" volunteered Carmel. \"He reads all the time  when he's waiting for us in the car.\"    Johnson accepted with alacrity the invitation to view the Abbey, and  walked round the ruins apparently much interested in what he saw,  though, following his usual custom, he spoke seldom, and then only in  brief reply to questions. Once, when Major and Mrs. Rogers were puzzling  over a Latin inscription, he seemed on the point of making a remark, but  apparently changed his mind, and walked away.    \"He's almost _too_ well trained!\" commented Mrs. Rogers. \"Of course a  conversational chauffeur is a nuisance, but I have an impression that  Johnson could be quite interesting if he liked. Some day I shall try to  make him talk.\"    \"Better leave him alone,\" said Major Rogers. \"I think things do very  well as they are.\"    From Glastonbury they motored through the beautiful county of Somerset  into leafy Devonshire, taking easy stages so as not to overtire the  invalid, and halting at any place where the guide book pointed out  objects worthy of notice. To please Carmel, they were making in the  direction of Tivermouth, where they hoped to arrive in time to meet the  Ingletons. They had telegraphed for rooms at the Hill Crest Hotel, and,  if the place suited Major Rogers, they proposed to spend a week there.    \"There may be perhaps a dance, or a tennis tournament, or something  interesting going on!\" exulted Sheila, who had urged the decision. \"At  any rate there'll be somebody to talk to in a decent hotel--it won't be  just all scenery! Let us spin along, Dad, and get there!\"    \"Hurry no man's cattle!\" replied her father. \"Remember, I am out for a  'rabbit' holiday, and I like long rests by the roadside. I'm looking  forward to a siesta on the grass somewhere this afternoon. The scent of  the woods does me good.\"    So once more the party found a picturesque spot and stopped for lunch  and an hour or two of quiet under the trees before they took again to  the open road. The spot which they chose this time was on a slope  reaching down to a river. Above was a thick belt of pines, and below the  water dashed with a pleasant murmuring sound very soothing on a warm  afternoon. It was an ideal \"rabbit playground\" for Major Rogers, and he  established himself comfortably with rugs and cushions after lunch,  hoping to be able to snatch some much-needed sleep. Mrs. Rogers took her  knitting from her hand-bag, and Sheila, who had a voluminous  correspondence, asked Johnson for her dispatch case and began to write  letters.    As Carmel had nothing very particular to do, and grew tired of sitting  still, she rose presently and rambled down the wood to the river-side.  It was beautiful to stand and watch the water swirling by, to gaze at  the meadow on the opposite bank, and to amuse herself by throwing little  sticks into the hurrying current. There was an old split tree-trunk that  overhung the bank, and it struck her that this would make a most  comfortable and delightful rustic seat. She climbed on to it quite  easily, crawled along, and sat at the end with her feet swinging over  the river. It was such an idyllic situation that she felt herself a  mixture of a tree nymph and a water nymph, or--to follow the Major's  humor--could almost imagine that she was taking her holiday in the shape  of a bird. If she would have been content to remain quietly seated, just  enjoying the scenery all might have been well, but unfortunately Carmel  made the discovery that by exercising a little energy she could make the  stump rock. The sensation was as pleasant as a swing. Up and down and up  and down she swayed, till the poor old split tree could bear the strain  no longer, and suddenly, with an awful crash, the part on which she  rested broke off, and precipitated her into the river. Her cry of terror  as she struck the water echoed through the wood. As she rose to the  surface she managed to clutch hold of some of the branches and support  herself, but she was in a position of great danger, for the stump was  hardly holding to the edge of the bank, and in another moment or two  would probably be whirled away by the current.    As she shouted again there was a quick dash through the undergrowth, and  Johnson the chauffeur shot down through the wood at a speed that could  almost compete with the car's. In a bound he jumped the bank, and,  plunging into the river, struggled to her help and succeeded in pulling  her back out of the current into the shallow water among the reeds at  the brink.    By this time Major and Mrs. Rogers and Sheila had all three rushed to  the spot, and were able to extend hands from the bank. Carmel and  Johnson both scrambled out of the river wet through and covered with  mud, the most wretched and dilapidated objects.    \"Oh! she'll take a chill! Whatever are we to do to get her dry?\" cried  Mrs. Rogers distractedly, mopping her young guest's streaming face with  a dainty lace-bordered handkerchief. \"Is there a cottage anywhere near?\"    \"We'd better get into the car and motor along till we find one,\"  suggested Major Rogers. \"Johnson, you deserve a medal for this! I never  saw anything so prompt in my life. It was like a whirlwind!\"    \"We shall make a horrible mess of the car!\" objected Carmel, trying to  wipe some of the mud from her clothes.    \"Never mind; sit on this rug. You're shivering already, child! Sheila,  bring my hand-bag and your father's cushion. Now, Johnson, just  anywhere! The very first cottage that will take us in!\"    Luckily they were not far from a village with a fairly comfortable inn,  where a sympathetic landlady provided bedrooms and hot water. As their  luggage was on the car, it was an easy matter to change, and before very  long both Carmel and her rescuer were in dry garments, and drinking the  hot coffee which Mrs. Rogers insisted upon as a preventive against  catching cold.    \"I shall hardly dare to let you out of my sight again, Carmel!\" she  said, half laughingly, yet half in earnest. \"I don't want to have to  write to your mother and tell her you're drowned!\"    \"Nonsense!\" declared the Major rather testily. \"It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#17)"],[1,"r, and so fall a ready prey to the artillery of their foes--                  Unarmed they might    Have easily, as spirits, evaded swift    By quick contraction or remove; but now    Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout.    They eat and drink and digest; they even--and here, though we be armed  with triple brass, we cannot avoid a sense of shock--they even blush when  an indiscreet question is asked of them. When Raphael colours at the  inquisitive demands of Adam, it gives a melancholy force to his earlier  suggestion--                              What if Earth    Be but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein    Each to other like more than on Earth is thought?    This is the scheme of things, and these are the actors, that Milton sets  in motion. We shall do well to accept the limitations he assigns, and to  look in his poem only for what is to be found there. It would be a  wearisome and fruitless quest to journey through the _Paradise Lost_ in  search of those profound touches of humanity, and those sudden felicities  of insight, which abound in the Elizabethans. Subtleties of thought, fine  observation of truths that almost evade the attempt to express them,  sentences and figures illuminative of the mysteries of human destiny and  the intricacies of human character--of all these there is none. If an  author's works are to be used as a treasury or garner of wise and  striking sayings, the harvest of sensibility and experience, _Paradise  Lost_ will yield only a poor handful of gleanings. One such reflection,  enforced by a happy figure, occurs in the Third Book, where Satan,  disguised as a youthful Cherub, deceives the Archangel Uriel--      So spake the false dissembler unperceived;    For neither man nor angel can discern    Hypocrisy--the only evil that walks    Invisible, except to God alone,    By His permissive will, through Heaven and Earth;    And oft, though Wisdom wake, Suspicion sleeps    At Wisdom's gate, and to Simplicity    Resigns her charge, while Goodness thinks no ill    Where no ill seems.    Milton plainly had known hypocrisy, and had been deceived by it. But it  would be difficult to match this reflection with any single other passage  in the whole poem. To say that such reflections are common in Shakespeare  would be too moderate a statement; they are the very air he breathes. And  even in the lesser dramatists the happy embodiment of observation in a  telling figure is to be found on every page. An acute criticism, for  instance, is condensed in a dramatic form by Ford, where he describes  what may be called low politeness--                    Smooth formality    Is usher to the rankness of the blood,    But impudence bears up the train.    The peculiar combination of formality and impudence that marks  ill-breeding was never more happily described than in this figure; the  mock solemnity of the usher comes first, and is soon followed by the  grimacing antics of the page, while each in his own way implies that the  advances of courtesy are a pomp and a deceit. Metaphors of the same kind  abound in the work of more modern analytic poets. Here is another parable  of a door-keeper, more poetic than Milton's:--      They say that Pity in Love's service dwells,    A porter at the rosy temple's gate.    I missed him going; but it is my fate    To come upon him now beside his wells;    Whereby I know that I Love's temple leave,    And that the purple doors have closed behind.    In Milton's poetry we find ourselves in a remote atmosphere; far indeed  from the shrewd observation of daily life, farther even from that  wonderful analysis of emotion which is the pastime of Shakespeare and of  Meredith. Beautiful figured writing and keen psychological observation of  this kind are beside the purpose of Milton, and beyond his power.    For the time we must forego the attempt to see into the life of things,  and must accept in imagination our position as citizens in this strange  majestic commonwealth of angels and men. It is no mean city. Noble shapes  pass before our eyes. High language is held, and great wars are waged.  Events of tremendous import roll on to their destined accomplishment.  Golden processions move across the dim expanse of Chaos. Worlds are blown  and broken like bubbles. There is concerted song, feasting, and  gratulation; dire plots are hatched and blaze forth into light; will  clashes with will; Heaven opens, and a torrent of flaming ruin is poured  forth into the deep. The Victor, ensconced in his omnipotence, is  fiercely triumphant; and in the dark below there is the dull gleam of  unconquered pride, deadly courage, and immortal despair. But in the midst  of all this vast rivalry of interests and jar of opposed systems, a cry  is heard, like that muffled cry which caught Macbeth's ear as he nerved  himself for his last fight. It is the cry of the human soul, left  homeless and derelict in a universe where she is the only alien. For her  the amaranth of the empyreal Heaven is as comfortless as the adamant of  Hell. She has lost her Paradise even while Adam's was building--the  Paradise where the flowers fade, and loves and hates are mortal.    In the poem itself signs are not wanting that Milton felt the terrible  strain imposed upon him by the intense and prolonged abstraction of his  theme--its unreality and superhuman elevation. Some of the comparisons  that he chooses to illustrate scenes in Hell are taken from the incidents  of simple rustic life, and by their contrast with the lurid creatures of  his imagination come like a draught of cold water to a traveller in a  tropical waste of sand and thorns. It is almost as if the poet himself  were oppressed by the suffocation of the atmosphere that he has created,  and, gasping for breath, sought relief by summoning up to remembrance the  sweet security of pastoral life. So, when the devils are shrunk to enter  Pandemonium, they are compared to                              Faery elves    Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side    Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,    Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon    Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth    Wheels her pale course.    The rejoicings, again, at the end of the infernal consultation, are  described in a figure that makes a like impression, and brings the same  momentary relief--      As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds    Ascending, while the North-wind sleeps, o'erspread    Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element    Scowls o'er the darkened landskip snow or shower,    If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,    Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,    The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds    Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.    The splendid artifice of contrast, noted by De Quincey as one of the  subtlest of Milton's devices, is illustrated, perhaps, by both these  passages. De Quincey instances neither, but chooses, as examples of the  way in which two images may act and react, heightening each other by  contrast--first, the use of architectural terms in describing Paradise;  next, the exhibition of a banquet in the desert in _Paradise  Regained_--\"stimulating the sense of its utter solitude and remotion from  men and cities\"; and, last and best, the comparison of Satan, in the same  poem, to an old man gathering sticks upon a winter's day. \"The household  image of old age, of human infirmity, and of domestic hearths, are all  meant as a machinery for provoking and soliciting the fearful idea to  which they are placed in collision, and as so many repelling poles.\"    This is clever criticism and true philosophy. But the chief effect from  the more elaborate figures of this kind is to be found merely in the  reprieve and refreshment that they bring. There is a sense of pathos,  almost of tears, in being allowed, for one moment only, to taste reality  again, to revisit familiar scenes, before we are once more bound on the  slow wheel of unnatural events that is urged forward by the poet. Nothing  in Eden comes home to the feelings more directly than the simile used to  describe Satan as he watches Eve on the morning of the temptation--      As one who, long in populous city pent,    Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,    Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe    Among the pleasant villages and farms    Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight--    The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,    Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound--    If chance with nymph-like step fair virgin pass,    What pleasing seemed for her now pleases more,    She most, and in her look sums all delight:    Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold    This flowery plot, the sweet recess of Eve.    The Serpent is glad to escape from Hell, to breathe the morning air of  Eden. But how glad we are to escape from Eden                              To breathe    Among the pleasant villages and farms!    There are no villages and farms in Eden, no smell of hay, no sheaves of  corn, no cottages, no roads, and no trace of that most human of symbols,  the thin blue scarf of smoke rising from a wayside encampment. Even when  we are privileged to assist at the first festal celebration of  hospitality on Earth, the dinner given to the Angel, for which Eve  gathers                        Fruit of all kinds, in coat    Rough or smooth rined, or bearded husk, or shell,    and heaps them, with bountiful hand, on the table of raised turf, we are  not perfectly at ease with our hosts. Not all the dignity of Adam, nor  all the beauty of Eve, can make us forget that they are nut-eaters, that  they have not the art of cooking, and do not ferment the juice of the  grape. A short stay in Eden teaches us the sad truth that we are  dependent, not only for the pleasures of our life, but even for many of  the dearest pleasures of our imagination, on the devices \"introduced by  the necessities of sin.\" We cannot settle"]]]
