'With pleasure,' said Lucy, the moment he asked her, and he could see  she had been making up what she should answer, while he was making up  his mind to ask. 'I shall be delighted to help you in this and all the  other tasks. Say yes.'    'Yes,' said Philip, who was very hungry.    '\"In this and all the other tasks\" say.'    'In this and all the other tasks,' he said. 'Go on. How can we do it?'    'It's _crochet_,' Lucy giggled. 'It's a little crochet mat I'd made of  red wool; and I put it in the hall that night. You've just got to find  the end and pull, and it all comes undone. You just want to find the end  and pull.'    'It's too heavy for us to pull.'    'Well,' said Lucy, who had certainly had time to think everything out,  'you get one of those twisty round things they pull boats out of the sea  with, and I'll find the end while you're getting it.'    She ran up the steps and Philip looked round the buildings on the other  three sides of the square, to see if any one of them looked like a  capstan shop, for he understood, as of course you also have done, that a  capstan was what Lucy meant.    On a building almost opposite he read, 'Naval Necessaries Supply  Company,' and he ran across to it.    'Rather,' said the secretary of the company, a plump sailor-doll, when  Philip had explained his needs. 'I'll send a dozen men over at once.  Only too proud to help, Sir Philip. The navy is always keen on helping  valour and beauty.'    'I want to be brave,' said Philip, 'but I'd rather not be beautiful.'    'Of course not,' said the secretary; and added surprisingly, 'I meant  the Lady Lucy.'    'Oh!' said Philip.    So twelve bluejackets and a capstan outside the Hall of Public  Amusements were soon the centre of a cheering crowd. Lucy had found the  end of the rope, and two sailors dragged it out and attached it to the  capstan, and then--round and round with a will and a breathless  chanty--the carpet was swiftly unravelled. Dozens of eager helpers stood  on the parts of the carpet which were not being unravelled, to keep it  steady while the pulling went on.    The news of Philip's success spread like wild-fire through the city, and  the crowds gathered thicker and thicker. The great doors beyond the  pillars with the birds on them were thrown open, and Mr. Noah and the  principal citizens stood there to see the end of the unravelling.    'Bravo!' said every one in tremendous enthusiasm. 'Bravo! Sir Philip.'    'It wasn't me,' said Philip difficultly, when the crowd paused for  breath; 'it was Lucy thought of it.'    'Bravo! Bravo!' shouted the crowd louder than ever. 'Bravo, for the Lady  Lucy! Bravo for Sir Philip, the modest truth-teller!'    [Illustration: So, all down the wide clear floor, Lucy danced.]    'Bravo, my dear,' said Mr. Noah, waving his hat and thumping Lucy on the  back.    'I'm awfully glad I thought of it,' she said; 'that makes two deeds Sir  Philip's done, doesn't it? Two out of the seven.'    'Yes, indeed,' said Mr. Noah enthusiastically. 'I must make him a  baronet now. His title will grow grander with each deed. There's an old  prophecy that the person who finds out how to unravel the carpet must be  the first to dance in the Hall of Public Amusements.              'The clever one, the noble one,             Who makes the carpet come undone,             Shall be the first to dance a measure             Within the Hall of public pleasure.    I suppose public _amusement_ was too difficult a rhyme even for these  highly-skilled poets, our astrologers. You, my child, seem to have been  well inspired in your choice of a costume. Dance, then, my Lady Lucy,  and let the prophecy be fulfilled.'    So, all down the wide clear floor of the Hall of Public Amusement, Lucy  danced. And the people of the city looked on and applauded, Philip with  the rest.          CHAPTER VI    THE LIONS IN THE DESERT      'But why?' asked Philip at dinner, which was no painted wonder of wooden  make-believe, but real roast guinea-fowl and angel pudding, 'Why do you  only have wooden things to eat at your banquets?'    'Banquets are extremely important occasions,' said Mr. Noah, 'and real  food--food that you can eat and enjoy--only serves to distract the mind  from the serious affairs of life. Many of the most successful caterers  in your world have grasped this great truth.'    'But why,' Lucy asked, 'do you have the big silver bowls with nothing in  them?'    Mr. Noah sighed. 'The bowls are for dessert,' he said.    'But there isn't any dessert _in_ them,' Lucy objected.    'No,' said Mr. Noah, sighing again, 'that's just it. There is no  dessert. There has never been any dessert. Will you have a little more  angel pudding?'    It was quite plain to Lucy and Philip that Mr. Noah wished to change the  subject, which, for some reason, was a sad one, and with true politeness  they both said 'Yes, please,' to the angel pudding offer, though they  had already had quite as much as they really needed.    After dinner Mr. Noah took them for a walk through the town, 'to see the  factories,' he said. This surprised Philip, who had been taught not to  build factories with his bricks because factories were so ugly, but the  factories turned out to be pleasant, long, low houses, with tall French  windows opening into gardens of roses, where people of all nations made  beautiful and useful things, and loved making them. And all the people  who were making them looked clean and happy.    'I wish we had factories like those,' Philip said. 'Our factories _are_  so ugly. Helen says so.'    'That's because all your factories are _money_ factories,' said Mr.  Noah, 'though they're called by all sorts of different names. Every one  here has to make something that isn't just money or _for_  money--something useful _and_ beautiful.'    'Even you?' said Lucy.    'Even I,' said Mr. Noah.    'What do you make?' the question was bound to come.    'Laws, of course,' Mr. Noah answered in some surprise. 'Didn't you know  I was the Chief Judge?'    'But laws can't be useful and beautiful, can they?'    'They can certainly be useful,' said Mr. Noah, 'and,' he added with  modest pride, 'my laws are beautiful. What do you think of this?  \"Everybody must try to be kind to everybody else. Any one who has been  unkind must be sorry and say so.\"'    'It seems all right,' said Philip, 'but it's not exactly beautiful.'    'Oh, don't you think so?' said Mr. Noah, a little hurt; 'it mayn't  _sound_ beautiful perhaps--I never could write poetry--but it's quite  beautiful when people do it.'    'Oh, if you mean your laws are beautiful when they're _kept_,' said  Philip.    'Beautiful things can't be beautiful when they're broken, of course,'  Mr. Noah explained. 'Not even laws. But ugly laws are only beautiful  when they _are_ broken. That's odd, isn't it? Laws are very tricky  things.'    'I say,' Philip said suddenly, as they climbed one of the steep flights  of steps between trees in pots, 'couldn't we do another of the deeds  now? I don't feel as if I'd really done anything to-day at all. It was  Lucy who did the carpet. Do tell us the next deed.'    'The next deed,' Mr. Noah answered, 'will probably take some time.  There's no reason why you should not begin it to-day if you like. It is  a deed peculiarly suited to a baronet. I don't know why,' he added  hastily; 'it may be that it is the only thing that baronets are good  for. I shouldn't wonder. The existence of baronets,' he added musingly,  'has always seemed to the thoughtful to lack justification. Perhaps this  deed which you will begin to-day is the wise end to which baronets were  designed.'    'Yes, I daresay,' said Philip; 'but what is the end?'    'I don't know,' Mr. Noah owned, 'but I'll tell you what the _deed_ is.  You've got to journey to the land of the Dwellers by the Sea and, by any  means that may commend itself to you, slay their fear.'    Philip naturally asked what the Dwellers by the Sea were afraid of.    'That you will learn from them,' said Mr. Noah; 'but it is a very great  fear.'    'Is it something we shall be afraid of _too_?' Lucy asked. And Philip at  once said, 'Oh, then she really did mean to come, did she? But she  wasn't to if she was afraid. Girls weren't expected to be brave.'    'They _are_, here,' said Mr. Noah, 'the girls are expected to be brave  and the boys kind.'    'Oh,' said Philip doubtfully. And Lucy said:    'Of course I meant to come. You know you promised.'    So that was settled.    'And now,' said Mr. Noah, rubbing his hands with the cheerful air of one  who has a great deal to do and is going to enjoy doing it, 'we must fit  you out a proper expedition, for the Dwellers by the Sea are a very long  way off. What would you like to ride on?'    'A horse,' said Philip, truly pleased. He said horse, because he did not  want to ride a donkey, and he had never seen any one ride any animal but  these two.    'That's right,' Mr. Noah said, patting him on the back. 'I _was_ so  afraid you'd ask for a bicycle. And there's a dreadful law here--it was  made by mistake, but there it is--that if any one asks for machinery  they have to have it and keep on using it. But as to a horse. Well, I'm  not sure. You see, you have to ride right across the pebbly waste, and  it's a good three days' journey. But come along to the stables.'    You know the kind of stables they would be? The long shed with stalls  such as you had, when you were little, for your little wooden horses and  carts? Only there were not only horses here, but every sort of animal  that has ever been ridden on. Elephants, camels, donkeys, mules, bulls,  goats, zebras, tortoises, ostriches, bisons, and pigs. And in the last  stall of all, which was not of common wood but of beaten silver, stood  the very Hippogriff himself, with his long, white mane and his long,  white tail, and his gentle, beautiful eyes. His long, white wings were  folded neatly on his satin-smooth back, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#17)"],[1,"the cows.  A  single meal of a goat is a quart, and of a sheep a pint.  Such at least  was the account, which I could extract from those of whom I am not sure  that they ever had inquired.    The milk of goats is much thinner than that of cows, and that of sheep is  much thicker.  Sheeps milk is never eaten before it is boiled: as it is  thick, it must be very liberal of curd, and the people of St. Kilda form  it into small cheeses.    The stags of the mountains are less than those of our parks, or forests,  perhaps not bigger than our fallow deer.  Their flesh has no rankness,  nor is inferiour in flavour to our common venison.  The roebuck I neither  saw nor tasted.  These are not countries for a regular chase.  The deer  are not driven with horns and hounds.  A sportsman, with his gun in his  hand, watches the animal, and when he has wounded him, traces him by the  blood.    They have a race of brinded greyhounds, larger and stronger than those  with which we course hares, and those are the only dogs used by them for  the chase.    Man is by the use of fire-arms made so much an overmatch for other  animals, that in all countries, where they are in use, the wild part of  the creation sensibly diminishes.  There will probably not be long,  either stags or roebucks in the Islands.  All the beasts of chase would  have been lost long ago in countries well inhabited, had they not been  preserved by laws for the pleasure of the rich.    There are in Sky neither rats nor mice, but the weasel is so frequent,  that he is heard in houses rattling behind chests or beds, as rats in  England.  They probably owe to his predominance that they have no other  vermin; for since the great rat took possession of this part of the  world, scarce a ship can touch at any port, but some of his race are left  behind.  They have within these few years began to infest the isle of  Col, where being left by some trading vessel, they have increased for  want of weasels to oppose them.    The inhabitants of Sky, and of the other Islands, which I have seen, are  commonly of the middle stature, with fewer among them very tall or very  short, than are seen in England, or perhaps, as their numbers are small,  the chances of any deviation from the common measure are necessarily few.  The tallest men that I saw are among those of higher rank.  In regions of  barrenness and scarcity, the human race is hindered in its growth by the  same causes as other animals.    The ladies have as much beauty here as in other places, but bloom and  softness are not to be expected among the lower classes, whose faces are  exposed to the rudeness of the climate, and whose features are sometimes  contracted by want, and sometimes hardened by the blasts.  Supreme beauty  is seldom found in cottages or work-shops, even where no real hardships  are suffered.  To expand the human face to its full perfection, it seems  necessary that the mind should co-operate by placidness of content, or  consciousness of superiority.    Their strength is proportionate to their size, but they are accustomed to  run upon rough ground, and therefore can with great agility skip over the  bog, or clamber the mountain.  For a campaign in the wastes of America,  soldiers better qualified could not have been found.  Having little work  to do, they are not willing, nor perhaps able to endure a long  continuance of manual labour, and are therefore considered as habitually  idle.    Having never been supplied with those accommodations, which life  extensively diversified with trades affords, they supply their wants by  very insufficient shifts, and endure many inconveniences, which a little  attention would easily relieve.  I have seen a horse carrying home the  harvest on a crate.  Under his tail was a stick for a crupper, held at  the two ends by twists of straw.  Hemp will grow in their islands, and  therefore ropes may be had.  If they wanted hemp, they might make better  cordage of rushes, or perhaps of nettles, than of straw.    Their method of life neither secures them perpetual health, nor exposes  them to any particular diseases.  There are physicians in the Islands,  who, I believe, all practise chirurgery, and all compound their own  medicines.    It is generally supposed, that life is longer in places where there are  few opportunities of luxury; but I found no instance here of  extraordinary longevity.  A cottager grows old over his oaten cakes, like  a citizen at a turtle feast.  He is indeed seldom incommoded by  corpulence.  Poverty preserves him from sinking under the burden of  himself, but he escapes no other injury of time.  Instances of long life  are often related, which those who hear them are more willing to credit  than examine.  To be told that any man has attained a hundred years,  gives hope and comfort to him who stands trembling on the brink of his  own climacterick.    Length of life is distributed impartially to very different modes of life  in very different climates; and the mountains have no greater examples of  age and health than the low lands, where I was introduced to two ladies  of high quality; one of whom, in her ninety-fourth year, presided at her  table with the full exercise of all her powers; and the other has  attained her eighty-fourth, without any diminution of her vivacity, and  with little reason to accuse time of depredations on her beauty.    In the Islands, as in most other places, the inhabitants are of different  rank, and one does not encroach here upon another.  Where there is no  commerce nor manufacture, he that is born poor can scarcely become rich;  and if none are able to buy estates, he that is born to land cannot  annihilate his family by selling it.  This was once the state of these  countries.  Perhaps there is no example, till within a century and half,  of any family whose estate was alienated otherwise than by violence or  forfeiture.  Since money has been brought amongst them, they have found,  like others, the art of spending more than they receive; and I saw with  grief the chief of a very ancient clan, whose Island was condemned by law  to be sold for the satisfaction of his creditors.    The name of highest dignity is Laird, of which there are in the extensive  Isle of Sky only three, Macdonald, Macleod, and Mackinnon.  The Laird is  the original owner of the land, whose natural power must be very great,  where no man lives but by agriculture; and where the produce of the land  is not conveyed through the labyrinths of traffick, but passes directly  from the hand that gathers it to the mouth that eats it.  The Laird has  all those in his power that live upon his farms.  Kings can, for the most  part, only exalt or degrade.  The Laird at pleasure can feed or starve,  can give bread, or withold it.  This inherent power was yet strengthened  by the kindness of consanguinity, and the reverence of patriarchal  authority.  The Laird was the father of the Clan, and his tenants  commonly bore his name.  And to these principles of original command was  added, for many ages, an exclusive right of legal jurisdiction.    This multifarious, and extensive obligation operated with force scarcely  credible.  Every duty, moral or political, was absorbed in affection and  adherence to the Chief.  Not many years have passed since the clans knew  no law but the Laird's will.  He told them to whom they should be friends  or enemies, what King they should obey, and what religion they should  profess.    When the Scots first rose in arms against the succession of the house of  Hanover, Lovat, the Chief of the Frasers, was in exile for a rape.  The  Frasers were very numerous, and very zealous against the government.  A  pardon was sent to Lovat.  He came to the English camp, and the clan  immediately deserted to him.    Next in dignity to the Laird is the Tacksman; a large taker or  lease-holder of land, of which he keeps part, as a domain, in his own  hand, and lets part to under tenants.  The Tacksman is necessarily a man  capable of securing to the Laird the whole rent, and is commonly a  collateral relation.  These tacks, or subordinate possessions, were long  considered as hereditary, and the occupant was distinguished by the name  of the place at which he resided.  He held a middle station, by which the  highest and the lowest orders were connected.  He paid rent and reverence  to the Laird, and received them from the tenants.  This tenure still  subsists, with its original operation, but not with the primitive  stability.  Since the islanders, no longer content to live, have learned  the desire of growing rich, an ancient dependent is in danger of giving  way to a higher bidder, at the expense of domestick dignity and  hereditary power.  The stranger, whose money buys him preference,  considers himself as paying for all that he has, and is indifferent about  the Laird's honour or safety.  The commodiousness of money is indeed  great; but there are some advantages which money cannot buy, and which  therefore no wise man will by the love of money be tempted to forego.    I have found in the hither parts of Scotland, men not defective in  judgment or general experience, who consider the Tacksman as a useless  burden of the ground, as a drone who lives upon the product of an estate,  without the right of property, or the merit of labour, and who  impoverishes at once the landlord and the tenant.  The land, say they, is  let to the Tacksman at sixpence an acre, and by him to the tenant at ten-  pence.  Let the owner be the immediate landlord to all the tenants; if he  sets the ground at eight-pence, he will increase his revenue by a fourth  part, and the tenant's burthen will be diminished by a fifth.    Those who pursue this train of reasoning, seem not sufficiently to  inquire whither it will lead them, nor to know that it will equally shew  the propriety of suppressing all wholesale trade, of shutting up the  shops of every man who"]]]
