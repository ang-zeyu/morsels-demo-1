States cannot be sued by private persons or corporations. Even upon  subjects constitutionally reserved for national law, if Congress has not  legislated state statute is valid.    Precisely as its advocates had prophesied, this revised order worked  well, bringing a blessed new feeling of security. On commerce and  business it conferred immense benefits, which rapidly became  disseminated through all classes of the population. The sense and  appearance of unity and consequent strength which the land had enjoyed  in the early days of the Revolution came back in greater completeness,  and was most gratifying to all. There was still a rankling hatred toward  England, and men hostile to central government on other grounds were  reconciled to it as the sole condition of successful commercial or naval  competition with that country.    The consequence was a wide-spread change of public feeling in reference  to the Constitution very soon after its adoption. Bitterest hostility  turned to praise that was often fulsome, reducing to insignificance an  opposition that had probably comprised a popular majority during the  very months of ratification. Many shifted their ground merely to be on  the popular side. With multitudes Washington's influence had more weight  than any argument.    The Constitution's unfortunate elasticity of interpretation also for the  time worked well. People who had fought it saw how their cherished views  could after all be based upon it. All parties soon began, therefore, to  swear by the Constitution as their political Bible. The fathers of the  immortal paper were exalted into demigods. Fidelity to the Constitution  came to be pre-eminently the watchword of those till now against its  adoption. They in fact shouted this cry louder than the Federalists, who  had never regarded it a perfect instrument of government. It came to  pass ere long that nothing would blast a public measure so instantly or  so completely as the cry of its unconstitutionality.      [Illustration: Map of the Continental United States.]  Map Showing the Progressive Acquisitions of Territory by the United States      Few can form any idea of the herculean work performed by the First  Congress in setting up and starting our present governmental machinery.  The debt which we owe the public men of that time is measureless. With  such care and wisdom did they proceed, that little done by them has  required alteration, the departments having run on decade after decade  till now essentially in their original grooves. The Senate formed itself  into its three classes, so that one-third of its members, and never more  than this, should retire at a time. Four executive departments were  created, those of State, the Treasury, War, and the  Attorney-Generalship. The first occupants were, respectively, Jefferson,  Hamilton, Knox, and Randolph.    Of the present departments of government the post-office alone has come  down from colonial times, Benjamin Franklin having been general  superintendent thereof under the British Government. He was re-appointed  by the second Continental Congress, in July, 1775. The First Congress  under the Constitution erected a general post-office, but its head  attained the dignity of a regular cabinet officer not till about 1830,  and then only by custom. To begin with, in fact, there was strictly no  cabinet in the modern sense. Washington's habit was to consult his  ministers separately.    Under the Articles of Confederation there had been a treasury board of  several commissioners, and a superintendent of finance. The new  arrangement, making one man responsible, was a great improvement. A law  was passed forbidding the Secretary of the Treasury to be concerned in  trade or commerce, that is, to be a merchant. The late A. T. Stewart,  appointed by President Grant to the office, was rejected as ineligible  under this law. Yet no department of our Government has had a finer  record than the Treasury.    Not only had the First Congress to vote revenue, but to make provision  for the collection of this. Revenue districts had to be mapped out, the  proper officers appointed, and light-houses, buoys, and public piers  arranged for along the whole coast.  Salaries were to be fixed, and a  multitude of questions relating to the interpretation and application of  the Constitution to be solved by patient deliberation. The United States  Mint was erected, and our so felicitous monetary system, based upon the  decimal principle along with the binary, established in place of the  desperate monetary chaos prevailing before. Hitherto there were four  sorts of colonial money of account all differing from sterling, while  Mexican dollars and numberless other forms of foreign money were in  actual circulation.    The noblest part of all this work was the organization of the federal  judiciary, through an act drawn up with extraordinary ability by Oliver  Ellsworth of Connecticut. A Chief Justice--the first one was John  Jay--and five associates were to constitute the Supreme Court. District  courts were ordained, one per State and one each for Kentucky and Maine,  not yet States; also three circuit courts, the eastern, the middle, and  the southern; and the jurisdiction of each grade was accurately fixed.  As yet there were no special circuit judges, nor, excepting the  temporary ones of 1801, were there till some eighty years later. Clerks,  marshals, and district-attorneys were part of this first arrangement.  Originally the Attorney-General was little but an honorary officer. He  kept his practice, had no public income but his fees, and resided where  he pleased.    As his title implies, the Secretary of War was to have charge of all the  nation's means of offence and defence, there being until April 30, 1796,  no separate secretary for the navy. We had indeed in 1789 little use for  such a functionary, not a war-vessel then remaining in Government's  possession. In 1784 our formidable navy consisted of a single ship, the  Alliance, but the following year Congress ordered her sold.    The senators most active in the creations just reviewed were Langdon,  King, and Robert Morris, besides Ellsworth. In the House, Madison outdid  all others in toil as in ability, though worthily seconded by  distinguished men like Fisher Ames, Gerry, Clymer, Fitzsimmons,  Boudinot, and Smith. The three Connecticut representatives, Sherman,  Trumbull, and Wadsworth, made up perhaps the ablest state delegation in  the body.        CHAPTER II.    FEDERALISM AND ANTI-FEDERALISM    [1790]    Early in the life of our Constitution two parties rose, which, under  various names, have continued ever since. During the strife for and  against adoption, those favoring this had been styled Federalists, and  their opponents, Anti-Federalists. After adoption--no one any longer  really antagonizing the Constitution--the two words little by little  shifted their meaning, a man being dubbed Federalist or Anti-Federalist  according to his preference for strong national government or for strong  state governments. The Federalist Party gave birth to the Whig Party,  and this to the modern Republican Party. The Anti-Federalists came to be  called \"Republicans,\" then \"Democratic-Republicans,\" then simply  \"Democrats.\"    The central plank of the federalist platform was vigorous single  nationality. In aid of this the Federalists wished a considerable army  and navy, so that the United States might be capable of ample  self-defence against all foes abroad or at home. Partly as a means to  this, partly to build up national feeling, unity, self-respect, and due  respect for the nation abroad, they sought to erect our national credit,  which had fallen so low, and to plant it on a solid and permanent basis.  As still further advancing these ends they proposed so to enforce regard  for the national authority and laws and obedience to them, that within  its sphere the nation should be absolutely and beyond question paramount  to the State.    In many who cherished them these noble purposes were accompanied by a  certain aristocratic feeling and manner, a carelessness of popular  opinion, an inclination to model governmental polity and administration  after the English, and an impatience with what was good in our native  American ideas and ways, which, however natural, were unfortunate and  unreasonable. Puffed up with pride at its victory in carrying the  Constitution against the opposition of the ignorant masses, this party  developed a haughtiness and a lack of republican spirit amounting in  some cases to deficient patriotism.    The early Federalists were of two widely different stripes. There were  among them Washington, Adams, Hamilton, and Jay; and there were the  interested and practical advocates of the same, made up of business men  and the wealthy and leisurely classes, who, without intending to be  selfish, were governed in political sympathy and action mainly by their  own interests.    The greatest early Anti-Federalists were Jefferson, Madison, and  Randolph, all of whom had been ardent for the Constitution. The party as  a whole, indeed, not only acquiesced in the re-creation of the general  Government, but was devotedly friendly to the new order. But while  Republicans admitted that a measure of governmental centralization was  indispensable, they prized the individual State as still the main pillar  of our political fabric, and were hence jealous of all increased  function at the centre. It became more and more their theory that the  States, rather than the individuals of the national body politic, had  been the parties to the Constitution, so making this to be a compact  like the old Articles, and the government under it a confederacy as  before 1789.    Another issue divided the parties, that between the strict and the more  free interpretation of the Constitution--between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22591"],[0,"A Political History of the State of New York, Volumes 1-3 (#17)"],[1,"together like a tripod, firm and invincible. In his distrust  of western influences, however, Morris was more conservative than Jay  or Hamilton. He was broad and liberal toward the original thirteen  States, but he wanted to subordinate the balance of the country to  their control. He regarded the people who might seek homes west of the  Alleghanies with something of the suspicion Jay entertained for the  propertyless citizens of New York. The day would come, he believed,  when those untutored, backwoods settlers would outnumber their  brethren on the Atlantic coast, and he desired some provision in the  Constitution which would permit the minority to rule such a majority.  If these views shrivelled his statesmanship, it may be said to his  credit that they discovered a prophetic gift most uncommon in those  days, giving him the power to see a great empire of people in the  fertile valley of the Mississippi and its tributaries.[79] Fifteen  years later Robert R. Livingston expressed the belief that not in a  century would a white man cross the Father of Waters.    [Footnote 79: Gouverneur Morris seemed to find history-making places.  With Washington and Greene he opposed the Conway cabal; with Jay and  Livingston he drafted the Constitution of the State; with Hamilton and  Madison he stood for the Federal Constitution, the revision of its  style being committed to his pen. Then Washington needed him, first in  England, afterward as minister to France; and when Monroe relieved him  in 1794 he travelled leisurely through Europe for four years, meeting  its distinguished writers and statesmen, forming friendships with  Madame De Stael and the Neckers, aiding and witnessing the release of  Lafayette from Olmutz prison, and finally assisting the young and  melancholy, but gentle and unassuming Duke of Orleans, afterward King  of France, to find a temporary asylum in the United States. He  returned to America ten years after he had sailed from the Delaware  capes, just in time to be called to the United States Senate.]    Into the life of Jay's peaceful administration came another  interesting character, the champion of every project known to the  inventive genius of his day. We shall hear much of Samuel Latham  Mitchill during the next three decades. He was now thirty-five years  old, a sort of universal eccentric genius, already known as  philosopher, scientist, teacher, and critic, a professor in Columbia,  the friend of Joseph Priestley, the author of scientific essays, and  the first in America to make mineralogical explorations. Perhaps if  he had worked in fewer fields he might have won greater renown, making  his name familiar to the general student of our own time; but he  belonged to an order of intellect far higher than most of his  associates, filling the books with his doings and sayings. Although  his influence, even among specialists, has probably faded now, he  inspired the scientific thought of his time, and established societies  which still exist, and whose history, up to the time of his death in  1831, was largely his own. Mitchill belonged to the Republican party  because it was the party of Jefferson, and he followed Jefferson  because Jefferson was a philosopher. For the same reason he became the  personal friend of Chancellor Livingston, with whom, among other  things, he founded the Society for the Promotion of Agriculture,  Manufactures, and the Useful Arts. It was said of Mitchill that \"he  was equally at home in studying the geology of Niagara, or the anatomy  of an egg; in offering suggestions as to the angle of a windmill, or  the shape of a gridiron; in deciphering a Babylonian brick, or in  advising how to apply steam to navigation.\"    Mitchill became a member of the Assembly in 1798, and it was his  interest in the experiments then being made of applying steam to  navigation, that led him to introduce a bill repealing the act of  1787, giving John Fitch the sole right to use steamboats on the  Hudson, and granting the privilege to Chancellor Livingston for a term  of twenty years, provided that within a year he should build a boat of  twenty tons capacity and propel it by steam at a speed of four miles  an hour. John Fitch had disappeared, and with him his idea of applying  steam to paddles. He had fitted a steam engine of his own invention  into a ferry-boat of his own construction, and for a whole summer this  creation of an uneducated genius had been seen by the people of  Philadelphia moving steadily against wind and tide; but money gave  out, the experiment was unsatisfactory, and Fitch wandered to the  banks of the Ohio, where opium helped him end his life in an obscure  Kentucky inn, while his steamboat rotted on the shores of the  Delaware. Then John Stevens of Hoboken began a series of experiments  in 1791, trying elliptical paddles, smoke-jack wheels, and other  ingenious contrivances, which soon found the oblivion of Fitch's  inventions. Subsequently Rumsey, another ingenious American, sought  with no better success to drive a boat by expelling water from the  stern. When it was announced that the great Chancellor also had a  scheme, it is not surprising, perhaps, that the wags of the Assembly  ridiculed the project as idle and whimsical. \"Imagine a boat,\" said  one, \"trying to propel itself by squirting water through its stern.\"  Another spoke of it as \"an application of the skunk principle.\" Ezra  L'Hommedieu, then a state senator, declared that Livingston's  \"steamboat bill\" was a standing subject of ridicule throughout the  entire session.    But there were others than legislators who made sport of these  apparently visionary projects to settle the value of steam as a  locomotive power. Benjamin H. Latrobe, the most eminent engineer in  America, did not hesitate to overwhelm such inventions with objections  that, in his opinion, could never be overcome. \"There are indeed  general objections to the use of the steam engine for impelling  boats,\" he wrote, in 1803, \"from which no particular mode of  application can be free. These are, first, the weight of the engine  and of the fuel; second, the large space it occupies; third, the  tendency of its action to rack the vessel and render it leaky; fourth,  the expense of maintenance; fifth, the irregularity of its motion and  the motion of the water in the boiler and cistern, and of the  fuel-vessel in rough water; sixth, the difficulty arising from the  liability of the paddles or oars to break, if light, and from the  weight, if made strong. Perhaps some of the objections against it may  be obviated. That founded on the expense and weight of the fuel may  not for some years exist in the Mississippi, where there is a  redundance of wood on the banks; but the cutting and loading will be  almost as great an evil.\"[80]    [Footnote 80: Rep. to the Am. Philosophical Society, Phila., May,  1803. Within four years the steamboat was running. Latrobe was  architect of the Capitol at Washington, which he also rebuilt after  the British burned it in 1814.]    Mitchill, however, would not be suppressed by the fun-making  legislators or the reasoning of a conservative engineer. \"I had to  encounter all their jokes and the whole of their logic,\" he wrote a  friend. His bill finally became a law, and Livingston, with the help  of the Doctor, placed a horizontal wheel in a well in the bottom and  centre of a boat, which propelled the water through an aperture in the  stern. The small engine, however, having an eighteen-inch cylinder and  three feet stroke, could obtain a speed of only three miles an hour,  and finding that the loss of power did not compensate for the  encumbrance of external wheels and the action of the waves, which he  hoped to escape, Livingston relinquished the plan. Four years later,  however, the Chancellor's money and Robert Fulton's genius were to  enrich the world with a discovery that has immortalised Fulton and  placed Livingston's name among the patrons of the greatest inventors.          CHAPTER VIII    OVERTHROW OF THE FEDERALISTS    1798-1800      It is difficult to select a more popular or satisfactory  administration than was Jay's first three years as governor.  Opposition growing out of his famous treaty had entirely subsided,  salutary changes in laws comforted the people, and with Hamilton's  financial system, then thoroughly understood and appreciated, came  unprecedented good times. To all appearances, therefore, Jay's  re-election in 1798 seemed assured by an increased majority, and the  announcement that Chancellor Livingston was a voluntary rival proved  something of a political shock.[81] For many years the relations  between Jay and Livingston were intimate. They had been partners in  the law, associates in the Council of Revision, colleagues in  Congress, co-workers in the formation of a state constitution, and  companions in the Poughkeepsie convention. Jay had succeeded  Livingston in 1784 as secretary of foreign affairs under the  Confederation, and while the charming Mrs. Jay was giving her now  historic dinners and suppers at 133 Broadway, her cousin, Robert R.  Livingston, of No. 3 Broadway, was among her most distinguished  guests. In her home Livingston made those arrangements with Hamilton  and Jay, the Morrises and the Schuylers, that resulted in the  overthrow of Governor Clinton and his supporters in the convention  which ratified the Federal Constitution.    [Footnote 81: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 400.]    But after Washington's inauguration, and Jay's appointment as chief  justice of the United States Supreme Court, the Chancellor had been as  intense, if not as violent an opponent of Federalism as Brockholst  Livingston. In their criticism of Jay's treaty these two cousins had  been especially bitter. The Chancellor attacked it as \"Cato,\"  Brockholst as \"Decius;\" the one spoke against it on the platform with  Aaron Burr, the other voluntarily joined the"]]]
