Come, bless the  good ship and the voyage--and be cursed to ye for a hag of Satan!\"    At that moment, catching sight of Mannering, the smuggler stopped with a  strange start. He thrust his hand into his pocket as if to draw out a  hidden weapon, exclaiming: \"What cheer, brother? You seem on the  outlook, eh?\"    But with a glance at the intruder Meg Merrilies checked him. In a moment  Hatteraick had altered his tone, and was speaking to Mannering civilly,  yet still with an undercurrent of sullen suspicion which he tried to  disguise under a mask of familiarity.    \"You are, I suppose,\" said Mannering, calmly, \"the master of that vessel  in the bay?\"    \"Ay, ay, sir,\" answered the sailor, \"I am Captain Dirk Hatteraick of the  _Yungfrauw Hagenslaapen_, and I am not ashamed of my name or of my  vessel, either. Right cognac I carry--rum, lace, real Mechlin, and  Souchong tea--if you will come aboard, I will send you ashore with a  pouchful of that last--Dirk Hatteraick knows how to be civil!\"    Mannering got rid of his offers without openly offending the man, and  was well content to see the precious pair vanish down the stone stairs  which had formerly served the garrison of the castle in time of siege.    On his return to the house of Ellangowan, Mannering related his  adventure, and asked of his host who this villanous-looking Dutchman  might be, and why he was allowed to wander at will on his lands.    This was pulling the trigger, and Mr. Bertram at once exploded into a  long catalogue of griefs. According to him, the man was undoubtedly one  Captain Dirk Hatteraick, a smuggler or free-trader. As for allowing him  on his lands--well, Dirk was not very canny to meddle with. Besides,  impossible as it was to believe, he, Godfrey Bertram of Ellangowan, was  not upon his Majesty's commission of the peace for the county. Jealousy  had kept him off--among other things the ill-will of the sitting member.  Besides which--after all a gentleman must have his cognac, and his lady  her tea and silks. Only smuggled articles came into the country. It was  a pity, of course, but he was not more to blame than others.    Thus the Laird maundered on, and Mannering, glad to escape being asked  about the doubtful fortune which the stars had predicted for the young  heir, did not interrupt him. On the next day, however, before he mounted  his horse, he put the written horoscope into a sealed envelope, and,  having strictly charged Bertram that it should not be opened till his  son reached the age of five years, he took his departure with many  expressions of regret.    The next five years were outwardly prosperous ones for Godfrey Bertram  of Ellangowan. As the result of an election where he had been of much  service to the winning candidate, he was again made a Justice of the  Peace, and immediately he set about proving to his brothers of the bench  that he could be both a determined and an active magistrate. But this  apparent good, brought as usual much of evil with it. Many old kindly  customs and courtesies had endeared Godfrey Bertram to his poorer  neighbours. He was, they said, no man's enemy, and even the gipsies of  the little settlement would have cut off their right hands before they  touched a pennyworth belonging to the Laird, their patron and protector.  But the other landlords twitted him with pretending to be an active  magistrate, and yet harbouring a gang of gipsies at his own door-cheek.  Whereupon the Laird went slowly and somewhat sadly home, revolving  schemes for getting rid of the colony of Derncleugh, at the head of  which was the old witch-wife Meg Merrilies.    Occasions of quarrel were easy to find. The sloe-eyed gipsy children  swinging on his gates were whipped down. The rough-coated donkeys  forbidden to eat their bite of grass in peace by the roadside. The men  were imprisoned for poaching, and matters went so far that one stout  young fellow was handed over to the press-gang at Dumfries and sent to  foreign parts to serve on board a man-of-war.    The gipsies, on their side, robbed the Ellangowan hen-roosts, stole the  linen from my lady's bleaching-green, cut down and barked the young  trees--though all the while scarce believing that their ancient friend  the Laird of Ellangowan had really turned against them.    During these five years the son, so strangely brought into the world on  the night of Mannering's visit, had been growing into the boldest and  brightest of boys. A wanderer by nature from his youth, he went  fearlessly into each nook and corner of his father's estates in search  of berries and flowers. He hunted every bog for rushes to weave  grenadiers' caps, and haled the hazelnuts from the lithe coppice boughs.    To Dominie Sampson, long since released from his village school, the  difficult task was committed of accompanying, restraining, and guiding  this daring spirit and active body. Shy, uncouth, awkward, with the  memory of his failure in the pulpit always upon him, the Dominie was  indeed quite able to instruct his pupil in the beginnings of learning,  but it proved quite out of his power to control the pair of twinkling  legs belonging to Master Harry Bertram. Once was the Dominie chased by a  cross-grained cow. Once he fell into the brook at the stepping-stones,  and once he was bogged in his middle in trying to gather water-lilies  for the young Laird. The village matrons who relieved Dominie Sampson  on this last occasion, declared that the Laird might just as well \"trust  the bairn to the care o' a tatie-bogle!\"[2] But the good tutor, nothing  daunted, continued grave and calm through all, only exclaiming, after  each fresh misfortune, the single word \"Prodeegious!\"    Often, too, Harry Bertram sought out Meg Merrilies at Derncleugh, where  he played his pranks among the gipsies as fearlessly as within the walls  of Ellangowan itself. Meanwhile the war between that active magistrate  Godfrey Bertram and the gipsies grew ever sharper. The Laird was  resolved to root them out, in order to stand well with his brother  magistrates. So the gipsies sullenly watched while the ground officer  chalked their doors in token that they must \"flit\" at the next term.    At last the fatal day arrived. A strong force of officers summoned the  gipsies to quit their houses, and when they did not obey, the sheriff's  men broke down the doors and pulled the roofs off the poor huts of  Derncleugh.    Godfrey Bertram, who was really a kindly man, had gone away for the day  to avoid the sight, leaving the business to the chief exciseman of the  neighbourhood,--one Frank Kennedy, a bold, roistering blade, who knew no  fear, and had no qualms whatever about ridding the neighbourhood of a  gang of \"sorners and thieves,\" as he called the Derncleugh gipsies.    But as Godfrey was riding back to Ellangowan with a single servant,  right in the middle of the King's highway, he met the whole congregation  of the exiles, evicted from their ruined houses, and sullenly taking  their way in search of a new shelter against the storms of the oncoming  winter. His servant rode forward to command every man to stand to his  beast's head while the Laird was passing.    \"He shall have his half of the road,\" growled one of the tall thin  gipsies, his features half-buried in a slouch hat, \"but he shall have no  more. The highway is as free to our cuddies as to his horse.\"    Never before had the Laird of Ellangowan received such a discourteous  reception. Anxious at the last to leave a good impression, he stammered  out as he passed one of the older men, \"And your son, Gabriel Baillie,  is he well?\" (He meant the young man who had been sent by means of the  press-gang to foreign parts.) With a deep scowl the old man replied, \"If  I had heard otherwise, _you_ would have heard it too!\"    At last Godfrey Bertram thought that he had escaped. He had passed the  last laden donkey of the expelled tribe. He was urging his beast toward  Ellangowan with a saddened spirit, when suddenly at a place where the  road was sunk between two high banks, Meg Merrilies appeared above him,  a freshly cut sapling in her hand, her dark eyes flashing anger, and her  elf-locks straying in wilder confusion than ever.    \"Ride your ways, Laird of Ellangowan,\" she cried, \"ride your ways,  Godfrey Bertram! This day ye have quenched seven smoking hearths--see if  the fire in your own parlour burns the brighter for that? Ye have riven  the thatch off seven cottars' houses--look if your roof-tree stands the  faster. There are thirty yonder that would have shed their lifeblood for  you--thirty, from the child of a week to the auld wife of a hundred,  that you have made homeless, that you have sent out to sleep with the  fox and the blackcock. Our bairns are hanging on our weary backs--look  to it that your braw cradle at hame is the fairer spread! Now ride your  ways, Godfrey Bertram. These are the last words ye shall ever hear from  Meg Merrilies, and this the last staff that I shall ever cut in the  bonny woods of Ellangowan!\"    [Illustration: \"MEG MERRILIES appeared above him, a freshly cut sapling  in her hand, her dark eyes flashing anger, and her elf-locks straying  in wilder confusion than ever.    \"'Ride your ways, Laird of Ellangowan,' she cried, 'ride your ways,  Godfrey Bertram! This day ye have quenched seven smoking hearths--see if  the fire in your own parlour burns the brighter for that!'\"]    And with the gesture of a queen delivering sentence she broke the  sapling she had held in her hand, and flung the fragments into the road.  The Laird was groping in his pocket for half a crown, and thinking  meanwhile what answer to make. But disdaining both his reply and his  peace-offering, Meg strode defiantly downhill after the caravan.           *       *       *       *       *    Not only was there war by land at Ellangowan. There was also war by sea.  The Laird,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22675"],[0,"Home Life in Colonial Days (#17)"],[1,"a farmhouse  was set with an array of empty pans, tubs, and baskets; of sharp knives  and heaped-up barrels of apples. A circle of laughing faces completed  the scene, and the barrels of apples were quickly emptied by the many  skilful hands. The apples intended for drying were strung on linen  thread and hung on the kitchen and attic rafters. The following day the  stout crane in the open fireplace was hung with brass kettles which were  filled with the pared apples, sweet and sour in proper proportions, the  sour at the bottom since they required more time to cook. If quinces  could be had, they were added to give flavor, and molasses, or  boiled-down pungent \"apple-molasses,\" was added for sweetening. As there  was danger that the sauce would burn over the roaring logs, many  housewives placed clean straw at the bottom of the kettle to keep the  apples from the fiercest heat. Days were spent in preparing the winter's  stock of apple-sauce, but when done and placed in barrels in the cellar,  it was always ready for use, and when slightly frozen was a keen relish.  Apple-butter was made of the pared apples boiled down with cider.    Wheat did not at first ripen well, so white bread was for a time rarely  eaten. Rye grew better, so bread made of \"rye-an'-injun,\" which was half  rye-meal, half corn-meal, was used instead. Bake-shops were so many in  number in all the towns that it is evident that housewives in towns and  villages did not make bread in every home as to-day, but bought it at  the baker's.    At the time when America was settled, no European peoples drank water as  we do to-day, for a constant beverage. The English drank ale, the Dutch  beer, the French and Spanish light wines, for every-day use. Hence it  seemed to the colonists a great trial and even a very dangerous  experiment to drink water in the New World. They were forced to do it,  however, in many cases; and to their surprise found that it agreed with  them very well, and that their health improved. Governor Winthrop of  Massachusetts, who was a most sensible and thoughtful man, soon had  water used as a constant drink by all in his household.    As cows increased in number and were cared for, milk of course was added  to the every-day fare. Rev. Mr. Higginson wrote in 1630 that milk cost  in Salem but a penny a quart; while another minister, John Cotton, said  that milk and ministers were the only things cheap in New England. At  that time milk cost but a penny and a quarter a quart in old England.    Milk became a very important part of the food of families in the  eighteenth century. In 1728 a discussion took place in the Boston  newspapers as to the expense of keeping a family \"of middling figure.\"  These writers all named only bread and milk for breakfast and supper.  Ten years later a minister, calculating the expenses of his family, set  down bread and milk for both breakfast and supper. Milk and hasty  pudding, milk and stewed pumpkin, milk and baked apples, milk and  berries, were variations. In winter, when milk was scarce, sweetened  cider diluted with water was used instead. Sometimes bread was soaked  with this mixture. It is said that children were usually very fond of  it.    As comparatively few New England families in the seventeenth century  owned churns, I cannot think that many made butter; of course families  of wealth ate it, but it was not common as to-day. In the inventories of  the property of the early settlers of Maine there is but one churn  named. Butter was worth from threepence to sixpence a pound. As cattle  increased the duties of the dairy grew, and soon were never-ceasing and  ever-tiring. The care of cream and making of butter was in the  eighteenth century the duty of every good wife and dame in the country,  and usually in the town.    Though the shape and ease of action of churns varied, still  butter-making itself varied little from the same work to-day. Several  old-time churns are shown, the revolving one being the most unusual.    Cheese was plentiful and good in all the Northern colonies. It was also  an unending care from the time the milk was set over the fire to warm  and then to curdle; through the breaking of the curds in the  cheese-basket; through shaping into cheeses and pressing in the  cheese-press, placing them on the cheese-ladders, and constantly turning  and rubbing them. An old cheese-press, cheese-ladder, and cheese-basket  from Deerfield Memorial Hall are shown in the illustration.    In all households, even in those of great wealth and many servants,  assistance was given in all housewifery by the daughters of the  household. In the South it was chiefly by superintendence and teaching  through actual exposition the negro slaves; in the North it was by the  careful performance of the work.    The manuscript cooking receipt-book of many an ancient dame shows the  great care they took in family cooking. English methods of cooking at  the time of the settlement of this country were very complicated and  very laborious.    It was a day of hashes, ragouts, soups, hotch-pots, etc. There were no  great joints served until the time of Charles the First. In almost every  sixteenth-century receipt for cooking meat, appear some such directions  as these: \"Y-mynce it, smyte them on gobbets, hew them on gobbets, chop  on gobbets, hew small, dyce them, skern them to dyce, kerf it to dyce,  grind all to dust, smyte on peces, parcel-hem; hew small on morselyen,  hack them small, cut them on culpons.\" Great amounts of spices were  used, even perfumes; and as there was no preservation of meat by ice,  perhaps the spices and perfumes were necessary.    Of course the colonists were forced to adopt simpler ways of cooking,  but as towns and commerce increased there were many kitchen duties which  made much tedious work. Many pickles, spiced fruits, preserves, candied  fruits and flowers, and marmalades were made.    Preserving was a very different art from canning fruit to-day. There  were no hermetically sealed jars, no chemical methods, no quick work  about it. Vast jars were filled with preserves so rich that there was no  need of keeping the air from them; they could be opened, that is, the  paper cover taken off, and used as desired; there was no fear of  fermentation, souring, or moulding.    The housewives pickled samphire, fennel, purple cabbage,  nasturtium-buds, green walnuts, lemons, radish-pods, barberries,  elder-buds, parsley, mushrooms, asparagus, and many kinds of fish and  fruit. They candied fruits and nuts, made many marmalades and  quiddonies, and a vast number of fruit wines and cordials. Even their  cakes, pies, and puddings were most complicated, and humble households  were lavish in the various kinds they manufactured and ate.    They collared and potted many kinds of fish and game, and they salted  and soused. Salted meat was eaten, and very little fresh meat; for there  were no means of keeping meat after it was killed. Every well-to-do  family had a \"powdering-tub,\" in which meat was \"powdered,\" that is,  salted and pickled. Many families had a smoke-house, in which beef, ham,  and bacon were smoked.    Perhaps the busiest month of the year was November,--called \"killing  time.\" When the chosen day arrived, oxen, cows, and swine which had been  fattened for the winter's stock were slaughtered early in the morning,  that the meat might be hard and cold before being put in the pickle.  Sausages, rolliches, and head-cheese were made, lard tried out, and  tallow saved.    A curious and quaint domestic implement or utensil found hanging on the  walls of some kitchens was what was known as a sausage-gun. One here is  shown with the piston detached, and also ready for use. The sausage-meat  was forced out through the nozzle into the sausage-cases. A simpler form  of sausage-stuffer has also been seen, much like a tube-and-piston  garden-syringe; though I must add a suspicion which has always lingered  in my mind that the latter utensil was really a syringe-gun, such as  once was used to disable humming-birds by squirting water upon them.    Sausage-meat was thus prepared in New York farmhouses. The meat was cut  coarsely into half-inch pieces and thrown into wooden boxes about three  feet long and ten inches deep. Then its first chopping was by men using  spades which had been ground to a sharp edge.    There were many families that found all their supply of sweetening in  maple sugar and honey; but housewives of dignity and elegance desired to  have some supply of sugar, certainly to offer visitors for their dish of  tea. This sugar was always loaf-sugar, and truly loaf-sugar; for it was  purchased ever in great loaves or cones which averaged in weight about  nine to ten pounds apiece. One cone would last thrifty folk for a year.  This pure clear sugar-cone always came wrapped in a deep blue-purple  paper, of such unusual and beautiful tint and so color-laden that in  country homes it was carefully saved and soaked, to supply a dye for a  small amount of the finest wool, which was used when spun and dyed for  some specially choice purpose. The cutting of this cone of sugar into  lumps of equal size and regular shape was distinctly the work of the  mistress and daughters of the house. It was too exact and too dainty a  piece of work to be intrusted to clumsy or wasteful servants. Various  simply shaped sugar-shears or sugar-cutters were used. An ordinary form  is shown in the illustration. I well recall the only family in which I  ever saw this solemn function of sugar-cutting take place--it was about  thirty years ago. An old Boston East India merchant, one of the last to  cling to a residence in what is known now as the \"Burnt District,\"  always desired (and his desire was law) to use these loaves of sugar in  his household. I don't know where he got them so long after every one  else had apparently ceased buying them--he may have specially imported  them; at any rate he"]]]
