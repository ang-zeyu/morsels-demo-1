[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#17)"],[1," OF MR. PARKER'S SONG, \"NIGHT-PIECE TO JULIA.\"]    The \"Six Songs\" show not a little of that modernity and opulent color  I have denied to the most of Mr. Parker's work. \"Oh, Ask Me Not\" is  nothing less than inspiration, rapturously beautiful, with a rich use  of unexpected intervals. The \"Egyptian Serenade\" is both novel and  beautiful. The other songs are good; even the comic-operatic flavor of  the \"Cavalry Song\" is redeemed by its catchy sweep.    Among a large number of works for the pipe-organ, few are so marked by  that purposeless rambling organists are so prone to, as the  \"Fantaisie.\" The \"Melody and Intermezzo\" of opus 20 makes a sprightly  humoresque. The \"Andante Religioso\" of opus 17 has really an  allegretto effect, and is much better as a gay pastorale than as a  devotional exercise. It is much more shepherdly than the avowed  \"Pastorale\" (opus 20), and almost as much so as the \"Eclogue,\"  delicious with the organ's possibilities for reed and pipe effects.  The \"Romanza\" is a gem of the first water. A charming quaint effect  is got by the accompaniment of the air, played legato on the swell,  with an echo, staccato, of its own chords on the great. The interlude  is a tender melody, beautifully managed. The two \"Concert Pieces\" are  marked by a large simplicity in treatment, and have this rare merit,  that they are less gymnastic exercises than expressions of feeling. A  fiery \"Triumphal March,\" a delightful \"Canzonetta,\" and a noble  \"Larghetto,\" of sombre, yet rich and well-modulated, colors, complete  the list of his works for the organ. None of these are registered with  over-elaboration.    To sacred music Parker has made important contributions. Besides a  dignified, yet impassioned, complete \"Morning and Evening Service for  the Holy Communion,\" he has written several single songs and anthems.    It is the masterwork, \"Hora Novissima,\" however, which lifts him above  golden mediocrity. From the three thousand lines of Bernard of Cluny's  poem, \"De Contemptu Mundi,\" famous since the twelfth century, and made  music with the mellowness of its own Latin rhyme, Mrs. Isabella G.  Parker, the composer's mother, has translated 210 lines. The English  is hardly more than a loose paraphrase, as this random parallel  proves:        Pars mea, Rex meus,    Most Mighty, most Holy,      In proprio Deus,       How great is the glory,        Ipse decore.           Thy throne enfolding.    Or this skilful evasion:        Tunc Jacob, Israel,    All the long history,      Et Lia, tunc Rachel    All the deep mystery        Efficietur.            Through ages hidden.    But it is perhaps better for avoiding the Charybdis of literalness.    Those who accuse Rossini's \"Stabat Mater\" of a fervor more theatric  than religious, will find the same faults in Parker's work, along with  much that is purely ecclesiastical. Though his sorrow is apt to become  petulance, there is much that is as big in spirit as in handling. The  work is frequently Mendelssohnian in treatment. An archaism that might  have been spared, since so little of the poem was retained, is the sad  old Haendelian style of repeating the same words indefinitely, to all  neglect of emptiness of meaning and triteness. Thus the words \"_Pars  mea, Rex meus_\" are repeated by the alto exactly thirteen times!  which, any one will admit, is an unlucky number, especially since the  other voices keep tossing the same unlucky words in a musical  battledore.    The especially good numbers of the work (which was composed in 1892,  and first produced, with almost sensational success, in 1893) are: the  magnificent opening chorus; the solo for the soprano; the large and  fiery finale to Part I.; the superb tenor solo, \"Golden Jerusalem,\"  which is possibly the most original and thrilling of all the numbers,  is, in every way, well varied, elaborated, and intensified, and  prepares well for the massive and effective double chorus, \"Stant Syon  Atria,\" an imposing structure whose ambition found skill sufficing; an  alto solo of original qualities; and a finale, tremendous, though  somewhat long drawn out. Of this work, so careful a critic as W.J.  Henderson was moved to write:        \"His melodic ideas are not only plentiful, but they are      beautiful, ... graceful and sometimes splendidly vigorous....      There is an a cappella chorus which is one of the finest      specimens of pure church polyphony that has been produced in      recent years.... It might have been written by Hobrecht,      Brumel, or even Josquin des Pres. It is impossible to write      higher praise than this.... The orchestration is      extraordinarily ... rich. As a whole ... the composition      ... may be set down as one of the finest achievements of the      present day.\"    And Philip Hale, a most discriminant musical enthusiast, described the  chorus \"Pars Mea\" as:        \"A masterpiece, true music of the church,\" to which \"any      acknowledged master of composition in Europe would gladly      sign his name.... For the a cappella chorus there is nothing      but unbounded praise.... Weighing words as counters, I do not      hesitate to say that I know of no one in the country or in      England who could by nature and by student's sweat have      written those eleven pages.... I have spoken of Mr. Parker's      quasi-operatic tendency. Now he is a modern. He has shown in      this very work his appreciation and his mastery of antique      religious musical art. But as a modern he is compelled to      feel the force of the dramatic in religious music.... But his      most far-reaching, his most exalted and rapt conception of      the bliss beyond compare is expressed in the language of      Palestrina and Bach.\"    In September, 1899, the work was produced with decisive success in  London, Parker conducting.    Besides this, there are several secular cantatas, particularly \"King  Trojan,\" which contains a singable tune for Trojan with many delicate  nuances in the accompaniment, and a harp-accompanied page's song that  is simply ambrosial. Then there is Arlo Bates' poem, \"The Kobolds,\"  which Parker has blessed with music as delicate as the laces of  gossamer-spiders.    His latest work is devoted to the legend of St. Christopher, and  displays the same abilities for massive and complex scoring whenever  the opportunity offers. On the other hand, the work discloses Parker's  weaknesses as well, for the libretto drags in certain love episodes  evidently thought desirable for the sake of contrast and yet  manifestly unnecessary to the story. The character of the queen, for  instance, is quite useless, and, in fact, disconcerting. The love  scene between the king and queen reminds one uncomfortably of Tristan  and Isolde, while a descending scale constantly used throughout the  work in the accompaniment incessantly suggests the \"Samson and  Delilah\" of Saint-Saens.    In spite of flaws, however,--flaws are to be had everywhere for the  looking,--Parker's work has its fine points. The struggle between the  demons and the singers of the sacred Latin Hymn has made excellent use  of the Tannhaeuser effect. The Cathedral scene shows Parker's resources  in the massive use of choruses to be very large. The barcarolling  billows of the river are ravishingly written, and the voice of the  child crying out is effectively introduced. The song the giant  Christopher sings through the storm is particularly superb.      _Frank van der Stucken._    [Illustration: FRANK VAN DER STUCKEN.]    On the bead-roll of those who have had both the ability and the  courage to take a stand for our music, the name of Frank van der  Stucken must stand high. His Americanism is very frail, so far as  birth and breeding count, but he has won his naturalization by his  ardor for native music.    Van der Stucken's life has been full of labors and honors. He was born  at Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1858, of a Belgian father and a German  mother. After the Civil War, in which the father served in the  Confederate army as a captain of the Texan cavalry, the family  returned to Belgium, where, at Antwerp, Van der Stucken studied under  Benoit. Here some of his music was played in the churches, and a  ballet at the Royal Theatre.    In 1878 he began studies in Leipzig, making important acquaintances,  such as Reinecke, Grieg, and Sinding. His first male chorus was sung  there, with great success. Of his fifth opus, consisting of nine  songs, Edvard Grieg wrote an enthusiastic criticism. After travelling  for some time, Van der Stucken was appointed kapellmeister at the  Breslau Stadt-Theatre. This was his debut as conductor. Here he  composed his well-known suite on Shakespeare's \"Tempest,\" which has  been performed abroad and here. Here, also, he wrote a \"Festzug,\" an  important work in Wagnerian style, and his passionate \"Pagina  d'Amore,\" which, with the published portions of his lyric drama,  \"Vlasda,\" has been performed by many great orchestras.    In 1883, Van der Stucken met Liszt, at Weimar, and under his auspices  gave a concert of his own compositions, winning the congratulations of  Grieg, Lassen, Liszt, and many other celebrated musicians. A prominent  German critic headed his review of the performance: \"A new star on the  musical firmament.\"    Van der Stucken was now called to the directorship of the famous Arion  Male Chorus in New York, a position which he held for eleven years  with remarkable results. In 1892 he took his chorus on a tour in  Europe and won superlative praises everywhere.    In 1885 and successive years Van der Stucken conducted orchestral  \"Novelty Concerts,\" which have an historical importance as giving the  first hearing to symphonic works by American composers. In Berlin and  in Paris he also gave our musicians the privilege of public  performance. From 1891 to 1894 he devoted himself to reforming the  Northeastern Saeengerbund, achieving the enormous task of making five  thousand male"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#17)"],[1,"  perfection, they sunk from one degree of wretchedness to another for  many years together, without the least hopes of ever getting above  distress and pinching want.    There is hardly an employment in life so trifling that it will not  afford a subsistence, if constantly and faithfully followed. Indeed, it  is by indefatigable diligence alone, that a fortune can be acquired in  any business whatever. An estate procured by what is commonly called a  lucky hit, is a rare instance; and he who expects to have his fortune  made in that way, is about as rational as he who should neglect all  probable means of earning, in hopes that he should some time or other  find a treasure.    There is no such thing as continuing in the same condition without an  income of some kind or other. If a man does not bestir himself, poverty  must, sooner or later, overtake him. If he continues to expend for the  necessary charges of life, and will not take the pains to gain  something to supply the place of what he deals out, his funds must at  length come to an end; and the misery of poverty fall upon him at an  age when he is less able to grapple with it.    No employment that is really useful to mankind deserves to be regarded  as mean. This has been a stumbling stone to many young men. Because  they could not pursue a course which they deemed sufficiently  respectable, they neglected business altogether until so late in life  that they were ashamed to make a beginning. A most fatal mistake. Pin  making is a minute affair, but will any one call the employment a mean  one? If _so_, it is one which the whole civilized world encourage, and  to which they are under lasting obligation daily. Any useful business  ought to be reputable, which is reputably followed.    The character of a drone is always, especially among the human species,  one of the most contemptible. In proportion to a person's activity for  his own good and that of his fellow creatures, he is to be regarded as  a more or less valuable member of society. If all the idle people in  the United States were to be buried in one year, the loss would be  trifling in comparison with the loss of only a _very few_ industrious  people. Each moment of time ought to be put to proper use, either in  business, in improving the mind, in the innocent and necessary  relaxations and entertainments of life, or in the care of the moral and  religious part of our nature. Each moment of time is, in the language  of theology, a monument of Divine mercy.      SECTION V. _Proper Time of Doing Business._    There are times and seasons for every lawful purpose of life, and a  very material part of prudence is to judge rightly, and make the best  of them. If you have to deal, for example, with a phlegmatic gloomy  man, take him, if you can, over his bottle. This advice may seem, at  first view, to give countenance to a species of fraud: but is it so?  These hypochondriacal people have their fits and starts, and if you do  not take them when they are in an agreeable state of mind, you are very  likely to find them quite as much below par, as the bottle raises them  above. But if you deal with them in this condition, they are no more  _themselves_ than in the former case. I therefore think the advice  correct. It is on the same principles, and in the same belief, that I  would advise you, when you deal with a covetous man, to propose your  business to him immediately after he has been receiving, rather than  expending money. So if you have to do with a drunkard, call on him in  the morning; for then, if ever, his head is clear.    Again; if you know a person to be unhappy in his family, meet him  abroad if possible, rather than at his own house. A statesman will not  be likely to give you a favorable reception immediately after being  disappointed in some of his schemes. Some people are always sour and  ill humored from the hour of rising till they have dined.    And as in persons, so in things, the _time_ is a matter of great  consequence; an eye to the rise and fall of goods; the favorable season  of importing and exporting;--these are some of the things which require  the attention of those who expect any considerable share of success.    It is not certain but some dishonest person, under shelter of the rule,  in this chapter, may gratify a wish to take unfair advantages of those  with whom he deals. But I hope otherwise; for I should be sorry to give  countenance, for one moment, to such conduct. My whole purpose (in this  place) is to give direction to the young for securing their own rights;  not for taking away the rights of others. The man who loves his  neighbor as himself, will not surely put a wrong construction on what I  have written. I would fain hope that there is no departure here or  elsewhere, in the book, from sound christian morality; for it is the  bible, on which I wish to see all moral rules based.      SECTION VI. _Buying upon Trust._    'Owe no man any thing,' is an apostolic injunction; and happy is he who  has it in his power to obey. In my own opinion, most young men possess  this power, did they perceive the importance of using it by  _commencing_ right. It is not so difficult a thing always to purchase  with ready money, as many people imagine. The great difficulty is to  moderate our desires and diminish our wants within bounds proportioned  to our income. We can expend much, or live on little; and this, too,  without descending to absolute penury. It is truly surprising to  observe how people in similar rank, condition, and circumstances,  contrive to _expend_ so very differently. I have known instances of  young men who would thrive on an income which would not more than half  support their neighbors in circumstances evidently similar.    Study therefore to live within your income. To this end you must  _calculate_. But here you will be obliged to learn much from personal  experience, dear as her school is, unless you are willing to learn from  that of others. If, for example, your income is $600 a year, and you  sit down at the commencement of the year and calculate on expending  $400, and saving the remainder, you will be very liable to fail in your  calculation. But if you call in the experience of wiser heads who have  travelled the road of life before you, they will tell you that after  you have made every reasonable allowance for necessary expenses during  the year, and believe yourself able to lay up $200, you will not, once  in ten times, be able to save more than _two thirds_ of that sum--and  this, too, without any sickness or casualty.    It is an important point _never to buy what you do not want_. Many  people buy an article merely because it is cheap, and they can have  credit. It is true they imagine they shall want it at some future time,  or can sell it again to advantage. But they would not buy at present,  if it cost them cash, from their pockets. The mischief is that when the  day of payment is distant, the cost seems more trifling than it really  is. Franklin's advice is in point; 'Buy what thou hast no need of, and  ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries;'--and such persons would do  well to remember it.    The difference between credit and ready money is very great.  Innumerable things are not bought at all with ready money, which would  be bought in case of trust; so much easier, is it, to _order_ a thing  than to _pay_ for it. A future day, a day of payment must come, to be  sure; but that is little thought of at the time. But if the money were  to be drawn out the moment the thing was received or offered, these  questions would arise; Can I not do without it? Is it indispensable?  And if I do not buy it, shall I suffer a loss or injury greater in  amount than the cost of the thing? If these questions were put, every  time we make a purchase, we should seldom hear of those suicides which  disgrace this country, and the old world still more.    I am aware that it will be said, and very truly, that the concerns of  merchants, the purchasing of great estates, and various other large  transactions, cannot be carried on in this manner; but these are rare  exceptions to the rule. And even in these cases, there might be much  less of bills and bonds, and all the sources of litigation, than there  now is. But in the every day business of life, in transactions with the  butcher, the baker, the tailor, the shoemaker, what excuse can there be  for pleading the example of the merchant, who carries on his work by  ships and exchanges?    A certain young man, on being requested to keep an account of all he  received and expended, answered that his business was not to keep  account books: that he was sure not to make a mistake as to his income;  and that as to his expenditure, the purse that held his money, would be  an infallible guide, for he never bought any thing that he did not  immediately pay for. I do not mean to recommend to young men not to  keep written accounts, for as the world is, I deem it indispensable.    Few, it is believed, will deny that they generally pay, for the same  article, a fourth part more, in the case of trust, than in that of  ready money. Suppose now, the baker, butcher, tailor, and shoemaker,  receive from you $400 a year. Now, if you multiply the $100 you lose,  by not paying ready money, by 20, you will find that at the end of  twenty years, you have a loss of $2,000, besides the accumulated  interest.    The fathers of the English _church_, forbade selling on trust at a  higher price than for ready money, which was the same thing in effect  as to _forbid trust_; and this was doubtless one of the great objects  those wise and pious men had in view; for they were fathers in  legislation and morals, as well as in religion. But we of the present  age, seem to have grown wiser than they, and not only make a difference  in the price, regulated by the difference in the mode of payment, but  no one is expected to do"]]]
