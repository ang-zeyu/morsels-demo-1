All they cared about now was the field clear  for running, the weapons in their hands, the enemy waiting under the hot  morning sun.    Drew never remembered afterward that splendid useless charge except as  chaos. He could not have told just when they were caught in a murderous  crossfire which poured canister at their undefended flanks. A man went  down before him, stumbling. The scout caught his foot against the  writhing body, pitched head forward, and struck on his bad arm. For a  moment or two the stabbing pain of that made the world red and black.  Then Drew was up on one knee again, just in time to realize foggily that  the Yankees were ripping at their flanks, that their charge was pocketed  by lead and steel, being wiped out. He steadied his gun hand on the  crook of his injured arm, tried to find some target, then fired  feverishly without one, the gun's recoil sending shivers of pain through  his whole shoulder and side.    The first wave of men had great gaps torn in its length. But those  remaining on their feet still ran up the slope, screaming their  defiance. A handful reached the breastworks. Drew saw one man by some  strange fortune scramble to the top of that timber wall, stand balanced  for a moment in triumph to take aim at a target below as if he himself  were invulnerable, and then plunge, as might a diver cleaving a pool,  out of sight on the other side.    Men faltered, the fire was breaking them, crumpling up the lines. All  the Union might was concentrated in a lead-and-canister hail on the  remnants of the brigade, making of the slope a holocaust in which  nothing human could continue to advance.    But new lines of gray-brown came steadily from the woodland, racing,  yelling, steadfast in their determination to storm that barricade and  pluck out the Yankees with their hands. They were wild men, with no  thought of personal safety. A color bearer went down. His standard was  seized by his right rank man before its red folds hit the churned,  stained ground, the soldier flinging aside his rifle to take tight grip  on the pole. The line came on at a run. Now broken squads of Kentuckians  re-formed; a battered lacework of what had been companies, regiments,  joined the newcomers.    Drew was on his feet. Where Kirby or any others of the small Morgan  contingent had vanished--whether Boyd _had_ been with them--he did not  know. He jammed his now empty Colt into its holster, drew its twin,  still not wholly aware that the breastworks were too far away for small  arms' fire to have any effect.    Now the whole world was no larger than that stretch of open ground and  the breastworks, the men in blue behind them. Only the flanking fire  still withered the gray lines, curling them up as the sun had withered  and curled the leaves on the shrubs by the dried stream bed. This was  walking stiff-legged through a bath of fire--sun fire, lead-death  fire--with no end except the hope of reaching the ridge top and the  fight waiting there.    But they could not reach that wall--except singly, or in twos and  threes, then only to fall. And the waves of men no longer broke from the  woods to lap up and recede sullenly down the slope. Out of nowhere, just  as they fell back to the first fringe of trees, came an officer on a  tall gray horse. His coat was gone, he rode in his shirt sleeves, and a  bullet-torn tatter waved from one wide shoulder. Above prominent  cheekbones, his eyes were hot and bright, his clipped beard pointed  sharply from a jaw which must be grimly set, his face was flushed, and  his energy and will was like a cloud to engulf the disheartened men as  he bore down upon them.    His galloping course threaded through the shattered groups of  Kentuckians, men fast disintegrating into a mob as the realization of  their failure on the slope began to strike home--no longer a portion of  an army believing in itself. But, sighting him, they followed his route  with a rising wave of cheers--cheers which even though they came from  dry throats rose in force and violence to that inarticulate Yell which  had raised them past all fear up the hill.    From his saddle, the officer leaned to grab at a standard, whirling the  flag aloft and around his head so that its scarlet length, crossed with  the starred blue bands, made a tossing splotch of color, to hold and  draw men's eyes. And now he was shouting, too, somehow his words  carrying through the uproar in the woods.    \"Rally! Rally on colors!\"    \"Forrest!\" A man beside Drew whooped, threw his hat into the air. \"The  old man's here! Forrest!\"    They were pulled together about that rider and his waving standard.  Lines tightened, death-made gaps closed. They steadied, again a fighting  command and not a crowd of men facing defeat. And having welded that  force, Forrest did not demand a second charge. He was furiously  angry--not with them, Drew sensed--but with someone or something beyond  the men crowding about him. It was not until afterward that rumor seeped  out through the ranks; it had not been Forrest's kind of battle, not his  plan. And he now had five hundred empty saddles to weight the scales  after a battle which was not his.    Drew leaned against a bullet-clipped tree. Men were at work with some of  the same will as had taken them to attack, building a barricade of their  own, expecting a counterthrust from the enemy. He wiped his sweaty face  with the back of his hand. His throat was one long dry ache; nowhere had  he seen a familiar face.    Somewhere among this collection of broken units and scrambled companies  of survivors he must find his own. He stood away from the tree, fighting  thirst, weariness, and the shaking reaction from the past few hours, to  move through the badly mauled force, afraid to allow himself to think  what--or who--might still lie out on the ridge under the white heat of  the sun.    \"Rennie!\"    Drew rounded a fieldpiece which had been manhandled off the firing line,  one wheel shattered. He steadied himself against its caisson and turned  his head with caution, fearing to be downed by the vertigo which seemed  to strike in waves ever since he had retreated to the cover of the  woods. He wanted to find the horse lines, to make sure that he had not  seen Boyd on the field just before the bugle had lifted them all into  that abortive charge.    It was Driscoll who hailed him. He had a red-stained rag tied about his  forearm and carried his hand tucked into the half-open front of his  shirt. Drew walked toward him slowly, feeling oddly detached. He noted  that the trooper's weathered face had a greenish shade, that his mouth  was working as if he were trying to shape soundless words.    \"Where're the rest?\" Drew asked.    Driscoll's good hand motioned to the left. \"Four ... five ... some  there. Standish--he got it with a shell--no head ... not any more--\" He  gave a sound like a giggle, and then his hand went hastily to his mouth  as he retched dryly.    Drew caught the other's shoulder, shaking him.    \"The others!\" he demanded more loudly, trying to pierce the curtain of  shock to Driscoll's thinking mind.    \"Four ... five ... some--\" Driscoll repeated. \"Standish, he's dead. Did  I tell you about Standish? A shell came along and--\"    \"Yes, you told me about Standish. Now show me where the others are!\"  Still keeping his shoulder grip, Drew edged Driscoll about until the  trooper was pointed in the general direction to which he had gestured.  Now Drew gave the man a push and followed.    \"Rennie!\" That was Captain Campbell. He was kneeling by a man on the  ground, a canteen in his hand.    Drew lurched forward. He was so sure that that inert casualty was Boyd,  and that Boyd was dead.    \"Boyd--\" he murmured stupidly, refusing to believe his eyes. The man  lying there had a brush of grayish beard on his chin, a mat of hair  which moved up and down as he breathed in heavy, panting gasps.    \"Boyd?\" This time the scout made a question of it.    One of the men in that little group moved. \"He got it--out there.\"    Drew shifted his weight. He felt as if he were striving to move a body  as heavy and as inert as that of an unconscious man. It took so long  even to raise his hand. Before he could question the trooper further,  another was before him.    Kirby, his powder-blackened face only inches away from that of the man  he had seized by a handful of shirt front, demanded: \"How do you know?\"    The man pulled back but not out of Kirby's clutch. \"He was right beside  me. Went down on the slope before we fell back--\"    So--Drew's thinking process was as slow as his weary body--he had been  right back there on the field! Boyd had been in the first line, and he  was still out there.    Again, Drew made one of those careful turns to keep his unsteadiness  under control. If Boyd was out there, he must be brought back--now!  Hands closed on Drew's shoulders, jerking him back so that he collided  with another body, and was held pinned against his captor.    \"You can't go theah now!\" Kirby spoke so closely to his ear that the  words were a roaring in his head. But they did not make sense. Drew  tried to wrench loose of that hold, the pain in his half-healed arm  answering. Then there was a period he could not account for at all, and  suddenly the sun was fading and it was evening. Somebody pushed a  canteen into his hand, then lifted both hand and canteen for him so that  he could drink some liquid which was not clear water but thick and  brackish, evil-tasting, but which moistened his dry mouth and swollen  tongue.    Through the gathering dusk he could see distant splotches of red and  yellow--were they fires? And shells screamed somewhere. Drew held his  head between his hands and cowered under that beat of noise which  combined with the pulsation of pain just over his eyes. Men were moving  around him, and horses. He heard tags of speech, but none of them were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23626"],[0,"The Chemistry, Properties and Tests of Precious Stones (#17)"],[1,"cloud it, probably to opacity, in accordance with the  quantity of impurity existent. This variety is composed of the oxides of  aluminium and silicon with lime. In colour it ranges from a beautiful  yellowish-orange deepening towards the red to a pure and beautiful red.    \"Romanzovite\" is another beautiful variety, the colour of which ranges  through browns to black. Another important variety is the \"succinite,\"  which gets up well and is a favourite with jewellers because of its  beautiful, amber-like colour, without possessing any of the drawbacks of  amber.    (E) The magnesia-alumina garnet--6MgO,3SiO_{2} +  2Al_{2}O_{3},3SiO_{2}--is somewhat rare, the most frequently found being  of a strong crimson colour and transparent. This variety is called  \"pyrope,\" the deeper and richer tints being designated \"carbuncle,\" from  the Latin _carbunculus_, a little coal, because when this beautiful  variety of the \"noble\" garnet is held up between the eyes and the sun,  it is no longer a deep, blood-red, but has exactly the appearance of a  small piece of live or glowing coal, the scarlet portion of its  colour-mixture being particularly evident. The ancient Greeks called it  anthrax, which name is sometimes used in medicine to-day with reference  to the severe boil-like inflammation which, from its burning and  redness, is called a carbuncle, though it is more usual to apply the  word \"anthrax\" to the malignant cattle-disease which is occasionally  passed on to man by means of wool, hair, blood-clots, etc., etc., and  almost always ends fatally. A great deal of mystery and superstition has  always existed in connexion with this stone--the invisibility of the  bearer of the egg-carbuncle laid by a goldfinch, for instance.    (F) The manganese-alumina garnet--6MnO,3SiO_{2} +  2Al{2}O_{3},3SiO_{2}--is usually found in a crystalline or granular  form, and mostly in granite and in the interstices of the plates, or  laminae, of rocks called schist. One variety of this, which is a deep  hyacinth in colour, though often of a brown-tinted red, is called  \"spessartine,\" or \"spessartite,\" from the district in which it is  chiefly found, though its distribution is a fairly wide one.      _The Lapis-Lazuli._    The lapis-lazuli, sometimes called \"azure stone,\" is almost always blue,  though often containing streaks of white and gold colour, the latter of  which are due to the presence of minute specks or veins of iron pyrites,  the former and colourless streaks being due to free lime, calcite, and  other substances which have become more or less blended with the blue  colour of the stone. It has a vitreous lustre, crystallises in the 1st,  or cubic system, and is a complex substance, varying considerably in its  ingredients in accordance with the locality in which it is found, its  matrix, and the general geological formation of the surrounding  substances, which may, by the penetration of moisture, be brought to  bear upon the stone, thus influencing to a great extent its chemical  composition. So that we find the stone composed of about a quarter of  its substance of alumina, or oxide of aluminium, silica to the extent of  almost half, the remainder being lime, soda, sulphur, and occasionally  traces of copper and iron. It is mostly found in granite and certain  crystalline limestone rocks, in fairly large masses. It is of great  antiquity, figuring extensively in ancient Egyptian history, both in its  form as a stone and ground up into a pigment for the decoration of  sacred and royal vessels and appointments. When so ground, it forms the  stable and magnificent colour, _genuine_ ultramarine, which is the  finest and purest blue on the artist's palette, but owing to its  extremely high price its use is not in very great demand, especially as  many excellent chemical substitutes of equal permanence are obtainable  at little cost.      _The Turquoise._    The turquoise is a pseudomorph (see Chapter IV., \"Cleavage.\") In colour  it is blue or greenish-blue, sometimes opaque, varying between that and  feeble translucency, though it should be said that in all forms, even  those considered opaque, a thin cutting of the stone appears almost  transparent, so that the usual classing of it among the opaque stones  must be done with this reservation. In composition it contains about 20  per cent. of water, about a third of its substance being phosphoric  acid, or phosphorus-pentoxide; sometimes nearly half of it is alumina,  with small quantities of iron in the form of variously coloured oxides,  with oxide of manganese. The great proportion of water, which it seems  to take up during formation, is mostly obtained in the cavities of  weathered and moisture-decomposing rocks. Its average formula may be  said to be Al_{2}O_{3}P_{2}O_{5} + 5H_{2}O, and sometimes Al_{2}O_{3}  FeOP_{2}O_{5} + 5H_{2}O. It must therefore follow that when the stone is  heated, this water will separate and be given off in steam, which is  found to be the case. The water comes off rapidly, the colour of the  stone altering meanwhile from its blue or blue-green to brown. If the  heat is continued sufficiently long, this brown will deepen to black,  while the flame is turned green. This is one of the tests for turquoise,  but as the stone is destroyed in the process, the experiment should be  made on a splinter from it.    This stone is of very ancient origin, and many old turquoise deposits,  now empty, have been discovered in various places. History records a  magnificent turquoise being offered in Russia for about L800 a few  centuries ago, which is a very high price for these comparatively common  stones.    Owing to the presence of phosphorus in bones, it is not uncommon to  find, in certain caves which have been the resort of wild animals, or  into which animals have fallen, that bones in time become subjected to  the oozing and moisture of their surroundings; alumina, as well as the  oxides of copper, manganese and iron, are often washed across and over  these bones lying on the cave floor, so that in time, this silt acts on  the substance of the bones, forming a variety of turquoise of exactly  the same composition as that just described, and of the same colour. So  that around the bones there eventually appears a beautiful turquoise  casing; the bone centre is also coloured like its casing, though not  entirely losing its bony characteristics, so that it really forms a kind  of ossified turquoise, surrounded by real turquoise, and this is called  the \"bone turquoise\" or \"odontolite.\"          INDEX      Adamantine lustre, 28    glimmering, 29    glinting, or glistening, 29    lustreless, 29    shining, 29    splendent, 29    Agate, 11    Almandine, 101    Amethyst, 11    oriental, 85    sapphire, 85    Amorphous stones and their characteristics, 23    Analysis, 5    Aplome, 101    Asters, or asteriated stones, 82, 87-91    Azure-stone, 103      Beryl, 10, 94    colours of, in dichroscope, 34    Beryllium, 10    Bezils, 66    Black stones, list of, 79    Blue sapphire, composition of the, 10    stones, list of, 77    Bone-turquoise, 106    Break, as opposed to cleavage, 19    Brilliant-cut stones, 66    Brown stones, list of, 76    Building up of crystals, 13    Burnt, or pinked topaz, 92      Cabochon-cut stones, 64    (the double), 65    (the hollow), 65    Carbonate series, 11    Carbuncle, 102, 103    Cat of Egypt, 89    Cat's eye stones, 82, 87-91    list of (see \"Chatoyant Stones\"), 78    Ceylonese cat's eye (see \"Cat's eye\")    Change of colour (not to be confused with \"Play of colour\" and \"Opalescence,\"  which see; see also \"Fire\"), 36    Characteristics of precious stones, 1, 3    Chatoyant stones, list of, 78    Chemical illustration of formation of precious stones, 8    Chloride of palladium in dichroscope, 34    Chrysoberyl, 88    Chrysolite, 11    ordinary, or \"noble\", 85    oriental, 85    Cinnamon stone, 102    Claims of precious stones, 4    Cleavage affecting tests, 43    and \"cleavage\" as opposed to \"break\", 19, 22    Colour, 26, 28, 30, 32    Colourless stones, list of, 75    Colours and characteristics of the various opals, 35, 36    of precious stones, list of, 75-79    Common garnet, 101    opal, 35    Composite crystals, 13    Composition of paste, or strass, for imitation stones, 71    Composition of precious stones, 7    Converted stones, 72    Corundum, 82    Crown portion of stones, 65, 66    Crystalline structure, physical properties, of 13    Crystallography, 14    Crystals, axes of symmetry, 15    groups of, 15, 16    planes of symmetry, 15    systems of, 16      (1) Cubic--isometric, monometric, regular, 16      (2) Hexagonal--rhombohedral, 16      (3) Tetragonal--quadratic, square prismatic, dimetric, pyramidal, 16      (4) Rhombic--orthorhombic, prismatic, trimetric, 16      (5) Monoclinic--clinorhombic, monosymmetric, oblique, 16, 17      (6) Triclinic--anorthic, asymmetric, 16, 17    treatment of, 14    Culasse portion of stones, 66    Cullinan diamond (see also \"Stars of Africa\"), 22, 64, 68, 80    Cutting of precious stones, 3, 4, 62    Cymophane, 90      Definition of a precious stone, 1    Diamond, characteristics of the, 80    composition of the, 10    (sapphire), 86    unique, 10    (zircon), 99    Diaphaneity, 26, 28    Diaphanous stones, 28    Dichroscope, 33    how to make a, 33    how to use a, 34    Dimorphism in precious stones, 25    Double cabochon-cut stones, 65    refraction (see \"Refraction\")    Doublets, 72      Electric and magnetic influences, 57    experiments with precious stones and pithball and electroscope, 57    experiments with tourmaline, 58, 59    Emerald, 10, 11, 95, 96    oriental, 85    En cabochon-cut stones, 64    Experiments to show electric polarity, 58, 59      Facets in stones, description of the, 67, 68    Feminine stones, 85    Fire in stones (see also \"Change of Colour,\" \"Opalescence,\" and \"Play of  Colour\"), 36, 37    Fire opal, 35    Flame-coloured stones, list of, 76"]]]
