And at the present time this king stands in the  temple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a mouse, and by  letters inscribed he says these words: \"Let him who looks upon me learn  to fear the gods.\"    So far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they who made  the report, declaring that from the first king down to this priest of  Hephaistos who reigned last, there had been three hundred and forty-one  generations of men, and that in them there had been the same number of  chief-priests and of kings: but three hundred generations of men are  equal to ten thousand years, for a hundred years is three generations  of men; and in the one-and-forty generations which remain, those I mean  which were added to the three hundred, there are one thousand three  hundred and forty years. Thus in the period of eleven thousand three  hundred and forty years they said that there had arisen no god in human  form; nor even before that time or afterwards among the remaining kings  who arise in Egypt, did they report that anything of that kind had come  to pass. In this time they said that the sun had moved four times from  his accustomed place of rising, and where he now sets he had thence  twice had his rising, and in the place from whence he now rises he had  twice had his setting; and in the meantime nothing in Egypt had been  changed from its usual state, neither that which comes from the earth  nor that which comes to them from the river nor that which concerns  diseases or deaths. And formerly when Hecataios the historian was in  Thebes, and had traced his descent and connected his family with a god  in the sixteenth generation before, the priests of Zeus did for him much  the same as they did for me (though I had not traced my descent). They  led me into the sanctuary of the temple, which is of great size, and  they counted up the number, showing colossal wooden statues in number  the same as they said; for each chief-priest there sets up in his  lifetime an image of himself: accordingly the priests, counting and  showing me these, declared to me that each one of them was a son  succeeding his own father, and they went up through the series of images  from the image of the one who had died last, until they had declared  this of the whole number. And when Hecataios had traced his descent and  connected his family with a god in the sixteenth generation, they traced  a descent in opposition to his, besides their numbering, not accepting  it from him that a man had been born from a god; and they traced their  counter-descent thus, saying that each one of the statues had been  _piromis_ son of _piromis_, until they had declared this of the whole  three hundred and forty-five statues, each one being surnamed _piromis_;  and neither with a god nor a hero did they connect their descent. Now  _piromis_ means in the tongue of Hellas \"honourable and good man.\" From  their declaration then it followed, that they of whom the images were  had been of form like this, and far removed from being gods: but in the  time before these men they said that gods were the rulers in Egypt, not  mingling with men, and that of these always one had power at a time;  and the last of them who was king over Egypt was Oros the son of Osiris,  whom the Hellenes call Apollo: he was king over Egypt last, having  deposed Typhon. Now Osiris in the tongue of Hellas is Dionysos.    Among the Hellenes Heracles and Dionysos and Pan are accounted the  lastest-born of the gods; but with the Egyptians Pan is a very ancient  god, and he is one of those which are called eight gods, while Heracles  is of the second rank, who are called the twelve gods, and Dionysos is  of the third rank, namely of those who were born of the twelve gods. Now  as to Heracles I have shown already how many years old he is according  to the Egyptians themselves, reckoning down to the reign of Amasis, and  Pan is said to have existed for yet more years than these, and Dionysos  for the smallest number of years as compared with the others; and even  for this last they reckon down to the reign of Amasis fifteen thousand  years. This the Egyptians say that they know for a certainty, since they  always kept a reckoning and wrote down the years as they came. Now the  Dionysos who is said to have been born of Semele the daughter of Cadmos,  was born about sixteen hundred years before my time, and Heracles who  was the son of Alcmene, about nine hundred years, and that Pan who was  born of Penelope, for of her and of Hermes Pan is said by the Hellenes  to have been born, came into being later than the wars of Troy, about  eight hundred years before my time. Of these two accounts every man may  adopt that one which he shall find the more credible when he hears it.  I however, for my part, have already declared my opinion about them. For  if these also, like Heracles the son of Amphitryon, had appeared before  all men's eyes and had lived their lives to old age in Hellas, I mean  Dionysos the son of Semele and Pan the son of Penelope, then one would  have said that these also had been born mere men, having the names  of those gods who had come into being long before: but as it is, with  regard to Dionysos the Hellenes say that as soon as he was born Zeus  sewed him up in his thigh and carried him to Nysa, which is above Egypt  in the land of Ethiopia; and as to Pan, they cannot say whither he went  after he was born. Hence it has become clear to me that the Hellenes  learnt the names of these gods later than those of the other gods, and  trace their descent as if their birth occurred at the time when they  first learnt their names.    Thus far then the history is told by the Egyptians themselves; but I  will now recount that which other nations also tell, and the Egyptians  in agreement with the others, of that which happened in this land: and  there will be added to this also something of that which I have myself  seen.    Being set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos, the  Egyptians, since they could not live any time without a king, set up  over them twelve kings, having divided all Egypt into twelve parts.  These made intermarriages with one another and reigned, making agreement  that they would not put down one another by force, nor seek to get an  advantage over one another, but would live in perfect friendship: and  the reason why they made these agreements, guarding them very strongly  from violation, was this, namely that an oracle had been given to them  at first when they began to exercise their rule, that he of them who  should pour a libation with a bronze cup in the temple of Hephaistos,  should be king of all Egypt (for they used to assemble together in all  the temples). Moreover they resolved to join all together and leave a  memorial of themselves; and having so resolved they caused to be made  a labyrinth, situated a little above the lake of Moiris and nearly  opposite to that which is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw  myself, and I found it greater than words can say. For if one should  put together and reckon up all the buildings and all the great works  produced by Hellenes, they would prove to be inferior in labour and  expense to this labyrinth, though it is true that both the temple at  Ephesos and that at Samos are works worthy of note. The pyramids also  were greater than words can say, and each one of them is equal to many  works of the Hellenes, great as they may be; but the labyrinth surpasses  even the pyramids. It has twelve courts covered in, with gates facing  one another, six upon the North side and six upon the South, joining on  one to another, and the same wall surrounds them all outside; and there  are in it two kinds of chambers, the one kind below the ground and the  other above upon these, three thousand in number, of each kind fifteen  hundred. The upper set of chambers we ourselves saw, going through them,  and we tell of them having looked upon them with our own eyes; but the  chambers under ground we heard about only; for the Egyptians who had  charge of them were not willing on any account to show them, saying that  here were the sepulchres of the kings who had first built this labyrinth  and of the sacred crocodiles. Accordingly we speak of the chambers below  by what we received from hearsay, while those above we saw ourselves and  found them to be works of more than human greatness. For the passages  through the chambers, and the goings this way and that way through  the courts, which were admirably adorned, afforded endless matter for  marvel, as we went through from a court to the chambers beyond it, and  from the chambers to colonnades, and from the colonnades to other rooms,  and then from the chambers again to other courts. Over the whole of  these is a roof made of stone like the walls; and the walls are covered  with figures carved upon them, each court being surrounded with pillars  of white stone fitted together most perfectly; and at the end of the  labyrinth, by the corner of it, there is a pyramid of forty fathoms,  upon which large figures are carved, and to this there is a way made  under ground.    Such is this labyrinth: but a cause for marvel even greater than this is  afforded by the lake, which is called the lake of Moiris, along the side  of which this labyrinth is built. The measure of its circuit is three  thousand six hundred furlongs (being sixty _schoines_), and this is the  same number of furlongs as the extent of Egypt itself along the sea. The  lake lies extended lengthwise from North to South, and in depth where it  is deepest it is fifty fathoms. That this lake is artificial and formed  by digging is self-evident, for about in the middle of the lake stand  two pyramids, each rising above the water to a height of fifty fathoms,  the part which is built below the water being of just the same height;  and upon each is placed a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#17)"],[1," just when the irksomeness of  their position was pressing hardest upon their brains, there was a quick  step on the stairs, a sharp tap at the door, the handle was turned  without any waiting for permission, and Wrench's head was thrust in.    \"I say, young gents,\" he cried, \"here's a go!\"    \"What's the matter?\" asked Glyn anxiously.  \"Don't say Slegge's worse.\"    \"I wasn't going to, sir.  It's something worse than that.\"    \"What?\"    \"There's a gentleman along with the Doctor.\"    \"A gentleman!\" cried the boys together.    \"Yes; a tall, military-looking gentleman, with long white starchers, and  such a voice.  He seemed as if he wanted to look me through.  Fierce as  fierce he was when he gave me his card to take in.\"    \"What was on the card?\" cried Glyn excitedly.    \"Can't you guess, sir?\" said the man, grinning.    \"Colonel Severn!\" shouted Singh.    \"My father!\" gasped Glyn.  \"Oh, Singhy!  And us with faces like this!\"        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    BEFORE THE \"STARCHERS.\"    Singh ran across to the glass on the dressing-table.    \"Why, Glyn, we can't see him.  I'm bad enough, but you are far worse.  What's to be done?\"    \"I dunno,\" cried Glyn.  \"Who in the world would have thought he was  coming down here to-day!\"    \"We are supposed to be in the infirmary, aren't we?\" said Singh.  \"I  say, couldn't we undress and go to bed?\"    \"No,\" said Glyn promptly.  \"What difference would that make?\"    \"Why, he'd think we were too ill to be seen.\"    \"Nonsense,\" cried Glyn.  \"Wouldn't he come up and see us all the same?\"    \"Oh dear!\" groaned Singh.  \"What a mess we are in!  This comes of your  fighting.\"    \"Well, who made me fight?  Who began it?\"    \"Well, I suppose it was I,\" said Singh; \"but I couldn't stand still and  let him knock us both about.  Oh dear, what a lot of bother it all is!\"    \"Here, I say, Wrench,\" cried Glyn excitedly, \"were you sent up to tell  us that my father was here?\"    \"No, sir,\" said the man, grinning; \"but I thought you'd like to know.  I  must go now, in case my bell rings.\"    The footman went off hurriedly, and the two boys, after a fresh visit to  the looking-glass, tried to make the best of their appearance.    Glyn combed his hair down in a streak over one side of his bruised  forehead, while Singh poured out some cold water and dabbed and sponged  his right eye; but he could not wash away the discoloration that  surrounded it, and after applying the towel he plumped himself down in a  chair and sat staring at his companion.    \"It's no use,\" he said; \"I daren't face guardian, and I won't.\"    \"You tell him so,\" said Glyn, laughing, \"and see what he will say.\"    \"How am I going to tell him so when I shan't see him?\"    \"Why, you'll be obliged to.\"    \"I tell you I won't!\" cried Singh passionately.    \"There's a sneak!  And you will let me go down alone and face it all.\"    \"Oh, I say, don't talk like that,\" cried Singh.  \"Can't we get out of it  somehow, old chap?  Let's run away till the Colonel's gone.\"    \"Yes, of course,\" cried Glyn sarcastically.  \"How much money have you  got?\"    \"Oh, I don't know; half-a-crown and some shillings.\"    \"Oh, I have got more than that.  I have got half-a-sovereign.  Shall we  go to Plymouth, and sail for somewhere abroad?\"    \"Yes, anywhere, so that we don't have to meet your father.\"    \"Ah,\" said Glyn, who was trying very hard to make the lock of hair he  had combed over a bruise stop in its place, but it kept jumping up again  and curling back to the customary position in spite of applications of  cold water and pomatum.    \"Well, what do you mean by `Ah'?\" grumbled Singh.    \"Mean by `Ah'?\" replied Glyn slowly.  \"Why, it means what a stupid old  chucklehead you are.  Run away!  Likely, isn't it?\"    \"Oh, too late! too late!\" cried Singh, for there was another sharp tap  at the door, and Wrench entered smartly, closely followed by his cat.    \"Doctor's compliments, gentlemen, and you are to come down into the  drawing-room directly.--And just you go back to the pantry at once,\" he  shouted at his cat.  \"How many more times am I to tell you that you are  not to follow me up into the young gentlemen's rooms?\"    \"Bah!\" shouted Glyn, and he threw the hairbrush he held smartly at the  footman, who caught it cleverly, as if he were fielding a ball at  mid-wicket, and deposited it upon the dressing-table.    \"Well caught, sir!\" cried the man, eulogising his own activity.  \"There,  never mind, gentlemen; go down and get it over.  There ain't anything to  be ashamed of.  If I was you, Mr Severn, I should feel proud at having  licked that great big disagreeable chap.  I shall be glad to see his  back.  He's quite big enough to leave school.\"    \"Ah!\" said Glyn with a sigh.  \"Come on, Singhy; Wrench is right.  Let's  get it over; only I want to bathe my face again.  It smells of old  Mother Hamton's embro--what did she call it?  You may as well go on  first.  I won't be long.\"    \"What!\" cried Singh, looking aghast at the speaker.  \"Go down and see  him alone?  I won't!  He's not my father; he's yours.  You may go first,  and I won't come unless I'm obliged.\"    \"Won't you?\" said Glyn, laughing softly, and he caught hold of his  companion's wrist and drew it under his arm.  \"Open the door, Wrenchy,  and make way for the hospital--two wounded men going down.--I say,  Singhy, look as bad as you can.  Here, I know: Wrenchy and I will carry  you down in a chair.\"    Singh opened his mouth quickly and shut it sharply, making his white  teeth close together with a snap.  Then knitting his brows and drawing a  deep breath, he held on tightly to his companion, and walked with him in  silence downstairs into the hall.  Here the pair stopped short by the  drawing-room door, where Wrench slipped before them and raised his hand  to show them in; but Glyn caught him by the arm.    \"Wait a moment,\" he said, and the three stood there by the mat, forming  a group, listening to the slow, heavy murmur of the Doctor's voice and  the replies given in a loud, sonorous, emphatic tone.    \"Now,\" said Glyn at last.    The door was thrown open, and they entered, to face the Doctor, who was  seated back in an easy-chair with his hands before him and finger-tips  joined; while right in the centre of the hearthrug, his back to the  fireplace and legs striding as if he were across his charger, stood the  tall grey Colonel, swarthy with sunburn and marked by the scar of a  tulwar-cut which had divided his eyebrow and passed diagonally from brow  to cheek.    He was gazing at the Doctor and listening politely to something he was  saying in his soft, smooth voice, but turned his head sharply as the  door was opened, and his ultra-long, heavy grey moustache seemed to  writhe as he fixed the boys with his keen grey eyes in turn.    \"Right, Doctor!\" he cried, as if he were giving an order to a squadron  to advance.  \"Disgraceful!--Well, you do look a pretty pair!\"    \"I'll leave you together,\" said the Doctor, rising slowly, and then  glancing at the boys.  \"Yes,\" he said softly, \"dreadfully marked; but  you should have seen them, Colonel, directly after their encounter.\"    \"Ha, yes; wounded on the field,\" said the Colonel drily.  \"Thank you.  Yes, sir, I think I should like to have a few words with them alone.\"    For the first time since they had known him the feeling was strong upon  the boys that they would have liked their preceptor to stay.    But the Doctor gave each of them a grave nod as he moved towards the  door, and they both stood as if chained to the carpet till the Colonel  made a stride forward, when Glyn recollected himself, ran to the door,  and opened it for the Doctor to pass out.    The Colonel grunted, and then as the door was closed, he marched slowly  across to his son; and as the boy faced him caught him by the shoulder  with his right hand, walked him back to where Singh stood alone, grabbed  him with his left, and forced them both towards the wide bay window  fully into the light.    \"Stand there!\" he said, in commanding tones.    Then stooping stiffly to seize the Doctor's easy-chair by the back, he  made the castors squeak as he swung it round and threw himself into it  with his back to the window, when he crossed one leg over the other, and  sat staring at them fiercely and scanning for some moments every trace  of the late encounter.    Glyn drew a long, deep breath loudly enough to be heard, while Singh  stood with hanging hands, opening and closing his fingers, and passing  his tongue quickly over his dry lips.  But the Colonel still went on  staring at them and frowning heavily the while.    At last Singh could bear it no longer.    \"Oh, say something, sir!\" he cried passionately.  \"Scold us, bully us,  punish us if you like; but I can't bear to be looked at like that.\"    It was the Colonel's turn now to draw a deep breath, as he raised  himself in the chair a little, thrust one hand behind him, fumbled for  his pocket, and then drew out a large soft bandana handkerchief and blew  his nose with a blast like a trumpeted order to charge.    Then, as he sank back in his chair, \"Ha, ha, ha! haw, haw, haw!\" he  literally roared.  \"Well, you do look a pretty pair of beauties!\" he  cried.  \"But this won't do.  Here, you, Glyn, what do you mean by this,  sir?  Didn't I warn you against fighting, and tell you to protect and  set an example to young Singh here?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"Look at yourself in the glass.  You look a pretty pattern, don't you?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"I told you to look at yourself in the glass.  Why don't you?\"    \"Because I know every scratch and bruise thoroughly by heart, father.\"    \"But--\" began the Colonel.    Here Singh interposed.    \"It wasn't his fault, sir,\" cried the boy.  \"It was mine.  He didn't  want to fight, and said he wouldn't.\"    \"Ho!\" said the Colonel.  \"Said he wouldn't fight, did he.\"    \"Yes, sir, and he actually let the big bully hit him.\"    \"Ha!\" said the Colonel.  \"And then knocked him down for"]]]
