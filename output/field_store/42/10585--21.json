Several low tables of the same lemon-hued wood  as the lamp-frame stood around; they were inlaid in fanciful designs  with gleaming green stones.  Turn my eyes where I would, clutch my  aching head as I might, this dream chamber would not disperse, but  remained palpable before me--yellow and green and gold.    There was a niche behind the divan upon which I lay framed about  with yellow wood.  In it stood a golden bowl and a tall pot of  yellow porcelain; I lay amid yellow cushions having golden tassels.  Some of them were figured with vivid green devices.    To contemplate my surroundings assuredly must be to court madness.  No door was visible, no window; nothing but silk and luxury, yellow  and green and gold.    To crown all, the air was heavy with a perfume wholly unmistakable  by one acquainted with Egypt's ruling vice.  It was the reek of  smouldering hashish--a stench that seemed to take me by the throat,  a vapour damnable and unclean.  I saw that a little censer, golden  in colour and inset with emeralds, stood upon the furthermost corner  of the yellow carpet.  From it rose a faint streak of vapour; and I  followed the course of the sickly scented smoke upward through the  still air until in oily spirals it lost itself near to the yellow  ceiling.  As a sick man will study the veriest trifle I studied  that wisp of smoke, pencilled grayly against the silken draperies,  the carven tables, against the almost terrifying persistency of the  yellow and green and gold.    I strove to rise, but was overcome by vertigo and sank back again  upon the yellow cushions.  I closed my eyes, which throbbed and  burned, and rested my head upon my hands.  I ceased to conjecture  if I dreamed or was awake.  I knew that I felt weak and ill, that  my head throbbed agonizingly, that my eyes smarted so as to render  it almost impossible to keep them open, that a ceaseless humming  was in my ears.    For some time I lay endeavouring to regain command of myself, to  prepare to face again that scene which had something horrifying  in its yellowness, touched with the green and gold.    And when finally I reopened my eyes, I sat up with a suppressed cry.  For a tall figure in a yellow robe from beneath which peeped yellow  slippers, a figure crowned with a green turban, stood in the centre  of the apartment!    It was that of a majestic old man, white bearded, with aquiline  nose, and the fierce eagle eyes of a fanatic set upon me sternly,  reprovingly.    With folded arms he stood watching me, and I drew a sharp breath and  rose slowly to my feet.    There amid the yellow and green and gold, amid the abominable reek  of burning hashish I stood and faced Hassan of Aleppo!    No words came to me; I was confounded.    Hassan spoke in that gentle voice which I had heard only once before.    \"Mr. Cavanagh,\" he said, \"I have brought you here that I might warn  you.  Your police are seeking me night and day, and I am fully alive  to my danger whilst I stay in your midst.  But for close upon a  thousand years the Sheikh-al-jebal, Lord of the Hashishin, has  guarded the traditions and the relics of the Prophet, Salla-'llahu  'ale yhi wasellem!  I, Hassan of Aleppo, am Sheikh of the Order  to-day, and my sacred duty has brought me here.\"    The piercing gaze never left my face.  I  was not yet by any means  my own man and still I made no reply.    \"You have been wise,\" continued Hassan, \"in that you have never  touched the sacred slipper.  Had you lain hands upon it, no secrecy  could have availed you.  The eye of the Hashishin sees all.  There  is a shaft of light which the true Believer perceives at night as  he travels toward El-Medineh.  It is the light which uprises, a  spiritual fire, from the tomb of the Prophet (Salla-'llahu 'aleyhi  wasellem!).  The relics also are radiant, though in a lesser degree.\"    He took a step toward me, spreading out his lean brown hands, palms  downward.    \"A shaft of light,\" he said impressively, \"shines upward now from  London.  It is the light of the holy slipper.\"  He gazed intently  at the yellow drapery at the left of the divan, but as though he  were looking not at the wall but through it.  His features worked  convulsively; he was a man inspired.  \"I see it now!\" he almost  whispered--\"that white light by which the guardians of the relic  may always know its resting place!\"    I managed to force words to my lips.    \"If you know where the slipper is,\" I said, more for the sake of  talking than for anything else, \"why do you not recover it?\"    Hassan turned his eyes upon me again.    \"Because the infidel dog,\" he cried loudly, \"who has soiled it with  his unclean touch, defies us--mocks us!  He has suffered the loss  of the offending hand, but the evil ginn protect him; he is inspired  by efreets!  But God is great and Mohammed is His only Prophet!  We  shall triumph; but it is written, oh, daring infidel, that you again  shall become the guardian of the slipper!\"    He spoke like some prophet of old and I stared at him fascinated.  I was loth to believe his words.    \"When again,\" he continued, \"the slipper shall be in the receptacle  of which you hold the key, that key must be given to me!\"    I thought I saw the drift of his words now; I thought I perceived  with what object I had been trapped and borne to this mysterious  abode for whose whereabouts the police vainly were seeking.  By the  exercise of the gift of divination it would seem that Hassan of  Aleppo had forecast the future history of the accursed slipper or  believed that he had done so.  According to his own words I was  doomed once more to become trustee of the relic.  The key of the  case at the Antiquarian Museum, to which he had prophesied the  slipper's return, would be the price of my life!  But--    \"In order that these things may be fulfilled,\" he continued, \"I must  permit you to return to your house.  So it is written, so it shall  be.  Your life is in my hands; beware when it is demanded of you  that you hesitate not in yielding up the key!\"    He raised his hands before him, making a sort of obeisance, I doubt  not in the direction of Mecca, drew aside one of the yellow hangings  behind him and disappeared, leaving me alone again in that nightmare  apartment of yellow and green and gold.  A moment I stood watching  the swaying curtain.  Utter silence reigned, and a sort of panic  seized me infinitely greater than that occasioned by the presence  of the weird Sheikh.  I felt that I must escape from the place or  that I should become raving mad.    I leapt forward to the curtain which Hassan had raised and jerked  it aside; it had concealed a door.  In this door and about level  with my eyes was a kind of little barred window through which shone  a dim green light.  I bent forward, peering into the place beyond,  but was unable to perceive anything save a vague greenness.    And as I peered, half believing that the whole episode was a  dreadful, fevered dream, the abominable fumes of hashish grew, or  seemed to grow, quite suddenly insupportable.  Through the square  opening, from the green void beyond, a cloud of oily vapour, pungent,  stifling, resembling that of burning Indian hemp, poured out and  enveloped me!    With a gasping cry I fell back, fighting for breath, for a breath  of clean air unpolluted with hashish.  But every inhalation drew  down into my lungs the fumes that I sought to escape from.  I  experienced a deathly sickness; I seemed to be sinking into a sea  of hashish, amid bubbles of yellow and green and gold, and I knew  no more until, struggling again to my feet, surrounded by utter  darkness--I struck my head on the corner of my writing-table ... for  I lay in my own study!    My revolver, unloaded, was upon the table beside me.  The night was  very still.  I think it must have been near to dawn.    \"My God!\" I whispered, \"did I dream it all?  Did I dream it all?\"          CHAPTER XXI    THE BLACK TUBE      \"There's no doubt in my mind,\" said Inspector Bristol, \"that your  experience was real enough.\"    The sun was shining into my room now, but could not wholly disperse  the cloud of horror which lay upon it.  That I had been drugged was  sufficiently evident from my present condition, and that I had been  taken away from my chambers Inspector Bristol had satisfactorily  proved by an examination of the soles of my slippers.    \"It was a clever trick,\" he said.  \"God knows what it was they  puffed into your face through the letter box, but the devilish arts  of ten centuries, we must remember, are at the command of Hassan of  Aleppo!  The repetition of the trick at the mysterious place you  were taken to is particularly interesting.  I should say you won't  be in a hurry to peer through letter boxes and so forth in the  future?\"    I shook my aching head.    \"That accursed yellow room,\" I replied, \"stank with the fumes of  hashish.  It may have been some preparation of hashish that was  used to drug me.\"    Bristol stood looking thoughtfully from the window.    \"It was a nightmare business, Mr. Cavanagh,\" he said; \"but it  doesn't advance our inquiry a little bit.  The prophecy of the old  man with the white beard--whom you assure me to be none other than  Hassan of Aleppo--is something we cannot very well act upon.  He  clearly believes it himself; for he has released you after having  captured you, evidently in order that you may be at liberty to take  up your duty as trustee of the slipper again.  If the slipper really  comes back to the Museum the fact will show Hassan to be something  little short of a magician.  I shan't envy you then, Mr. Cavanagh,  considering that you hold the keys of the case!\"    \"No,\" I replied wearily.  \"Poor Professor Deeping thought that he  acted in my interests and that my possession of the keys would  constitute a safeguard.  He was wrong.  It has plunged me into the  very vortex of this ghastly affair.\"    \"It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#17)"],[1,"with rapture of his black-letter Chaucer, which  he proposes to have bound 'in Gothique,' so as to unmodernize as much  as possible its outward appearance. But to Keats books were literature  or they were not literature, and one cannot think that his affections  would twine about ever so bookish a volume which was merely 'curious.'    One reads with sympathetic amusement of Keats's genuine and natural  horror of paying the same bill twice, 'there not being a more  unpleasant thing in the world (saving a thousand and one others).' The  necessity of preserving adequate evidence that a bill had been paid  was uppermost in his thought quite frequently; and once when, at Leigh  Hunt's instance, sundry packages of papers belonging to that eminently  methodical and businesslike man of letters were to be sorted out and  in part destroyed, Keats refused to burn any, 'for fear of demolishing  receipts.'    But the reader will chance upon few more humorous passages than that  in which the poet tells his brother George how he cures himself of the  blues, and at the same time spurs his flagging powers of invention:  'Whenever I find myself growing vaporish I rouse myself, wash and put  on a clean shirt, brush my hair and clothes, tie my shoe-strings  neatly, and, in fact, adonize, as if I were going out--then all clean  and comfortable, I sit down to write. This I find the greatest  relief.' The virtues of a clean shirt have often been sung, but it  remained for Keats to show what a change of linen and a general  _adonizing_ could do in the way of furnishing poetic stimulus. This is  better than coffee, brandy, absinthe, or falling in love; and it  prompts one to think anew that the English poets, taking them as a  whole, were a marvelously healthy and sensible breed of men.    It is, however, in respect to the light they throw upon the poet's  literary life that the letters are of highest significance. They  gratify to a reasonable extent that natural desire we all have to see  authorship in the act. The processes by which genius brings things to  pass are so mysterious that our curiosity is continually piqued; and  our failure to get at the real thing prompts us to be more or less  content with mere externals. If we may not hope to see the actual  process of making poetry, we may at least study the poet's manuscript.  By knowing of his habits of work we flatter ourselves that we are a  little nearer the secret of his power.    We must bear in mind that Keats was a boy, always a boy, and that he  died before he quite got out of boyhood. To be sure, most boys of  twenty-six would resent being described by so juvenile a term. But one  must have successfully passed twenty-six without doing anything in  particular to understand how exceedingly young twenty-six is. And to  have wrought so well in so short a time, Keats must have had from the  first a clear and noble conception of the nature of his work, as he  must also have displayed extraordinary diligence in the doing of it.  Perhaps these points are too obvious, and of a sort which would  naturally occur to any one; but it will be none the less interesting  to see how the letters bear witness to their truth.    In the first place, Keats was anything but a loafer at literature. He  seems never to have dawdled. A fine healthiness is apparent in all  allusions to his processes of work. 'I read and write about eight  hours a day,' he remarks in a letter to Haydon. Bailey, Keats's Oxford  friend, says that the fellow would go to his writing-desk soon after  breakfast, and stay there until two or three o'clock in the afternoon.  He was then writing _Endymion_. His stint was about 'fifty lines a  day, ... and he wrote with as much regularity, and apparently with as  much ease, as he wrote his letters.... Sometimes he fell short of his  allotted task, but not often, and he would make it up another day. But  he never forced himself.' Bailey quotes, in connection with this,  Keats's own remark to the effect that poetry would better not come at  all than not to come 'as naturally as the leaves of a tree.' Whether  this spontaneity of production was as great as that of some other  poets of his time may be questioned; but he would never have deserved  Tom Nash's sneer at those writers who can only produce by 'sleeping  betwixt every sentence.' Keats had in no small degree the 'fine  extemporal vein' with 'invention quicker than his eye.'    We uncritically feel that it could hardly have been otherwise in the  case of one with whom poetry was a passion. Keats had an infinite  hunger and thirst for good poetry. His poetical life, both in the  receptive and productive phases of it, was intense. Poetry was meat  and drink to him. He could even urge his friend Reynolds to talk about  it to him, much as one might beg a trusted friend to talk about one's  lady-love, and with the confidence that only the fitting thing would  be spoken. 'Whenever you write, say a word or two on some passage in  Shakespeare which may have come rather new to you,'--a sentence which  shows his faith in the many-sidedness of the great poetry. Shakespeare  was forever 'coming new' to _him_, and he was 'haunted' by particular  passages. He loved to fill the cup of his imagination with the  splendors of the best poets until the cup overflowed. 'I find I cannot  exist without Poetry,--without eternal Poetry; half the day will not  do,--the whole of it; I began with a little, but habit has made me a  leviathan.' He tells Leigh Hunt, in a letter written from Margate,  that he thought so much about poetry, and 'so long together,' that he  could not get to sleep at night. Whether this meant in working out  ideas of his own, or living over the thoughts of other poets, is of  little importance; the remark shows how deeply the roots of his life  were imbedded in poetical soil. He loved a debauch in the verse of  masters of his art. He could intoxicate himself with Shakespeare's  sonnets. He rioted in 'all their fine things said unconsciously.' We  are tempted to say, by just so much as he had large reverence for  these men, by just so much he was of them.    Undoubtedly, this ability to be moved by strong imaginative work may  be abused until it becomes a maudlin and quite disordered sentiment.  Keats was too well balanced to be carried into appreciative excesses.  He knew that mere yearning could not make a poet of one any more than  mere ambition could. He understood the limits of ambition as a force  in literature. Keats's ambition trembled in the presence of Keats's  conception of the magnitude of the poetic office. 'I have asked myself  so often why I should be a poet more than other men, seeing how great  a thing it is.' Yet he had honest confidence. One cannot help liking  him for the fine audacity with which he pronounces his own work  good,--better even than that of a certain other great name in English  literature; one cannot help loving him for the sweet humility with  which he accepts the view that, after all, success or failure lies  entirely without the range of self-choosing. There is a point of view  from which it is folly to hold a poet responsible even for his own  poetry, and when _Endymion_ was spoken of as 'slipshod' Keats could  reply, 'That it is so is no fault of mine.... The Genius of Poetry  must work out its own salvation in a man.... That which is creative  must create itself. In _Endymion_ I leaped headlong into the sea, and  thereby have become better acquainted with the soundings, the  quicksands, and the rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore,  and piped a silly pipe, and took tea and comfortable advice. I was  never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail than not be among the  greatest.'    Well might a man who could write that last sentence look upon poetry  not only as a responsible, but as a dangerous pursuit. Men who aspire  to be poets are gamblers. In all the lotteries of the literary life  none is so uncertain as this. A million chances that you don't win the  prize to one chance that you do. It is a curious thing that ever so  thoughtful and conscientious an author may not know whether he is  making literature or merely writing verse. He conforms to all the  canons of taste in his own day; he is devout and reverent; he shuns  excesses of diction, and he courts originality; his verse seems to  himself and to his unflattering friends instinct with the spirit of  his time, but twenty years later it is old-fashioned. Keats, with all  his feeling of certainty, stood with head uncovered before that power  which gives poetical gifts to one, and withholds them from another.  Above all would he avoid self-delusion in these things. 'There is no  greater Sin after the seven deadly than to flatter one's self into an  idea of being a great Poet.'    Keats, if one may judge from a letter written to John Taylor in  February, 1818, had little expectation that his _Endymion_ was going  to be met with universal plaudits. He doubtless looked for fair  treatment. He probably had no thought of being sneeringly addressed as  'Johnny,' or of getting recommendations to return to his 'plasters,  pills, and ointment boxes.' In fact, he looked upon the issue as  entirely problematical. He seemed willing to take it for granted that  in _Endymion_ he had but moved into the go-cart from the  leading-strings. 'If _Endymion_ serves me for a pioneer, perhaps I  ought to be content, for thank God I can read and perhaps understand  Shakespeare to his depths; and I have, I am sure, many friends who if  I fail will attribute any change in my life to humbleness rather than  pride,--to a cowering under the wings of great poets rather than to  bitterness that I am not appreciated.' And for evidence of any  especial bitterness because of the lashing he received one will search  the letters in vain. Keats was manly and good-humored, most of his  morbidity being referred directly to his ill health. The"]]]
