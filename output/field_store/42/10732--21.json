These stories finally crystallized in a form which  shows the English and Danish love of physical prowess (Havelok is the  strongest man in the kingdom), as well as a certain cruelty of  revenge which is more peculiarly Danish. There is resentment of the  Norman predominance to be found in the popularity of a story which  shows the kitchen-boy excelling all the nobles in manly exercises, and  the heiress to the kingdom wedded in scorn, as so many Saxon heiresses  were after the Conquest, to a mere scullion. There can be no doubt,  however, that Havelok stood to mediaeval England as a hero of the  strong arm, a champion of the populace against the ruling race, and  that his royal birth and dignity were a concession to historic facts  and probabilities, not much regarded by the common people. The story,  again, showed another truly humble hero, Grim the fisher, whose  loyalty was supposed to account for the special trading privileges of  his town, Grimsby. In Grim the story found a character who was in  reality a hero of the poor and lowly, with the characteristic devotion  of the tribesman to his chief, of the vassal to his lord, a devotion  which was handed on from father to son, so that a second generation  continued the services, and received the rewards, of the father who  risked life and all for the sake of his king's heir.    The reader will not fail to notice the characteristic anachronisms  which give to life in Saxon England in the tenth century the colour of  the Norman chivalry of the thirteenth.      Havelok and Godard    In Denmark, long ago, lived a good king named Birkabeyn, rich and  powerful, a great warrior and a man of mighty prowess, whose rule was  undisputed over the whole realm. He had three children--two daughters,  named Swanborow and Elfleda the Fair, and one young and goodly son,  Havelok, the heir to all his dominions. All too soon came the day  that no man can avoid, when Death would call King Birkabeyn away, and  he grieved sore over his young children to be left fatherless and  unprotected; but, after much reflection, and prayers to God for wisdom  to help his choice, he called to him Jarl Godard, a trusted counsellor  and friend, and committed into his hands the care of the realm and of  the three royal children, until Havelok should be of age to be  knighted and rule the land himself. King Birkabeyn felt that such a  charge was too great a temptation for any man unbound by oaths of  fealty and honour, and although he did not distrust his friend, he  required Godard to swear,        \"By altar and by holy service book,      By bells that call the faithful to the church,      By blessed sacrament, and sacred rites,      By Holy Rood, and Him who died thereon,      That thou wilt truly rule and keep my realm,      Wilt guard my babes in love and loyalty,      Until my son be grown, and dubbed knight:      That thou wilt then resign to him his land,      His power and rule, and all that owns his sway.\"    Jarl Godard took this most solemn oath at once with many protestations  of affection and whole-hearted devotion to the dying king and his  heir, and King Birkabeyn died happy in the thought that his children  would be well cared for during their helpless youth.    When the funeral rites were celebrated Jarl Godard assumed the rule of  the country, and, under pretext of securing the safety of the royal  children, removed them to a strong castle, where no man was allowed  access to them, and where they were kept so closely that the royal  residence became a prison in all but name. Godard, finding Denmark  submit to his government without resistance, began to adopt measures  to rid himself of the real heirs to the throne, and gave orders that  food and clothes should be supplied to the three children in such  scanty quantities that they might die of hardship; but since they were  slow to succumb to this cruel, torturing form of murder, he resolved  to slay them suddenly, knowing that no one durst call him to account.  Having steeled his heart against all pitiful thoughts, he went to the  castle, and was taken to the inner dungeon where the poor babes lay  shivering and weeping for cold and hunger. As he entered, Havelok, who  was even then a bold lad, greeted him courteously, and knelt before  him, with clasped hands, begging a boon.    \"Why do you weep and wail so sore?\" asked Godard.    \"Because we are so hungry,\" answered Havelok. \"We have so little food,  and we have no servants to wait on us; they do not give us half as  much as we could eat; we are shivering with cold, and our clothes are  all in rags. Woe to us that we were ever born! Is there in the land no  more corn with which men can make bread for us? We are nearly dead  from hunger.\"    These pathetic words had no effect on Godard, who had resolved to  yield to no pity and show no mercy. He seized the two little girls as  they lay cowering together, clasping one another for warmth, and cut  their throats, letting the bodies of the hapless babies fall to the  floor in a pool of blood; and then, turning to Havelok, aimed his  knife at the boy's heart. The poor child, terrified by the awful fate  of the two girls, knelt again before him and begged for mercy:        \"Fair lord, have mercy on me now, I pray!      Look on my helpless youth, and pity me!      Oh, let me live, and I will yield you all--      My realm of Denmark will I leave to you,      And swear that I will ne'er assail your sway.      Oh, pity me, lord! be compassionate!      And I will flee far from this land of mine,      And vow that Birkabeyn was ne'er my sire!\"    Jarl Godard was touched by Havelok's piteous speech, and felt some  faint compassion, so that he could not slay the lad himself; yet he  knew that his only safety was in Havelok's death.    \"If I let him go,\" thought he, \"Havelok will at last work me woe! I  shall have no peace in my life, and my children after me will not hold  the lordship of Denmark in safety, if Havelok escapes! Yet I cannot  slay him with my own hands. I will have him cast into the sea with an  anchor about his neck: thus at least his body will not float.\"    Godard left Havelok kneeling in terror, and, striding from the tower,  leaving the door locked behind him, he sent for an ignorant fisherman,  Grim, who, he thought, could be frightened into doing his will. When  Grim came he was led into an ante-room, where Godard, with terrible  look and voice, addressed him thus:    \"Grim, thou knowest thou art my thrall.\" \"Yea, fair lord,\" quoth Grim,  trembling at Godard's stern voice. \"And I can slay thee if thou dost  disobey me.\" \"Yea, lord; but how have I offended you?\" \"Thou hast not  yet; but I have a task for thee, and if thou dost it not, dire  punishment shall fall upon thee.\" \"Lord, what is the work that I must  do?\" asked the poor fisherman. \"Tarry: I will show thee.\" Then Godard  went into the inner room of the tower, whence he returned leading a  fair boy, who wept bitterly. \"Take this boy secretly to thy house, and  keep him there till dead of night; then launch thy boat, row out to  sea, and fling him therein with an anchor round his neck, so that I  shall see him never again.\"    Grim looked curiously at the weeping boy, and said: \"What reward  shall I have if I work this sin for you?\"    Godard replied: \"The sin will be on my head as I am thy lord and bid  thee do it; but I will make thee a freeman, noble and rich, and my  friend, if thou wilt do this secretly and discreetly.\"    Thus reassured and bribed, Grim suddenly took the boy, flung him to  the ground, and bound him hand and foot with cord which he took from  his pockets. So anxious was he to secure the boy that he drew the  cords very tight, and Havelok suffered terrible pain; he could not cry  out, for a handful of rags was thrust into his mouth and over his  nostrils, so that he could hardly breathe. Then Grim flung the poor  boy into a horrible black sack, and carried him thus from the castle,  as if he were bringing home broken food for his family. When Grim  reached his poor cottage, where his wife Leve was waiting for him, he  slung the sack from his shoulder and gave it to her, saying, \"Take  good care of this boy as of thy life. I am to drown him at midnight,  and if I do so my lord has promised to make me a free man and give me  great wealth.\"    When Dame Leve heard this she sprang up and flung the lad down in a  corner, and nearly broke his head with the crash against the earthen  floor. There Havelok lay, bruised and aching, while the couple went to  sleep, leaving the room all dark but for the red glow from the fire.  At midnight Grim awoke to do his lord's behest, and Dame Leve, going  to the living-room to kindle a light, was terrified by a mysterious  gleam as bright as day which shone around the boy on the floor and  streamed from his mouth. Leve hastily called Grim to see this wonder,  and together they released Havelok from the gag and bonds and  examined his body, when they found on the right shoulder the token of  true royalty, a cross of red gold.    \"God knows,\" quoth Grim, \"that this is the heir of our land. He will  come to rule in good time, will bear sway over England and Denmark,  and will punish the cruel Godard.\" Then, weeping sore, the loyal  fisherman fell down at Havelok's feet, crying, \"Lord, have mercy on me  and my wife! We are thy thralls, and never will we do aught against  thee. We will nourish thee until thou canst rule, and will hide thee  from Godard; and thou wilt perchance give me my freedom in return for  thy life.\"    At this unexpected address Havelok sat up surprised, and rubbed his  bruised head and said: \"I am nearly dead, what with hunger, and thy  cruel bonds, and the gag. Now bring me food in plenty!\" \"Yea, lord,\"  said Dame Leve, and bustled about, bringing the best they "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25550"],[0,"The Defiant Agents (#17)"],[1,"killed,\" Menlik returned briefly.    Kaydessa stirred and muttered a word or two to her brother. Hulagur's  head came up, and he exploded into violent speech.    \"What does he say?\" Deklay demanded.    The girl replied: \"He speaks of our father who aided in the escape of  three and so afterward was slain by the leader as a lesson to us--since  he was our 'white beard,' the Khan.\"    \"We have taken the oath in blood--under the Wolf Head Standard--that  they will also die,\" Menlik added. \"But first we must shake them out of  their ship-shell.\"    \"That is the problem,\" Travis elaborated for the benefit of his  clansmen. \"We must get these Reds away from their protected camp--out  into the open. When they now go they are covered by this 'caller' which  keeps the Tatars under their control, but it has no effect on us.\"    \"So, again I say: What is all this to us?\" Deklay got to his feet. \"This  machine does not hunt us, and we can make our camps in this land where  no Pinda-lick-o-yi can find them----\"    \"We are not _dobe-gusndhe-he_--invulnerable. Nor do we know the full  range of machines they can use. It does no one well to say  '_doxa-da_'--this is not so--when he does not know all that lies in an  enemy's wickiup.\"    To Travis' relief he saw agreement mirrored on Buck's face, Tsoay's,  Nolan's. From the beginning he had had little hope of swaying Deklay; he  could only trust that the verdict of the majority would be the accepted  one. It went back to the old, old Apache institution of prestige. A  _nantan_-chief had the _go'ndi_, the high power, as a gift from birth.  Common men could possess horse power or cattle power; they might have  the gift of acquiring wealth so they could make generous gifts--be  _ikadntl'izi_, the wealthy ones who spoke for their family groups within  the loose network of the tribe. But there was no hereditary  chieftainship or even an undivided rule within a rancheria. The  _nagunlka-dnat'an_, or war chief, often led only on the warpath and had  no voice in clan matters save those dealing with a raid.    And to have a split now would fatally weaken their small clan. Deklay  and those of a like mind might elect to withdraw and not one of the rest  could deny him that right.    \"We shall think on this,\" Buck said. \"Here is food, water, pasturage for  horses, a camp for our visitors. They will wait here.\" He looked at  Travis. \"You will wait with them, Fox, since you know their ways.\"    Travis' immediate reaction was objection, but then he realized Buck's  wisdom. To offer the proposition of alliance to the Apaches needed an  impartial spokesman. And if he himself did it, Deklay might  automatically oppose the idea. Let Buck talk and it would be a statement  of fact.    \"It is well,\" Travis agreed.    Buck looked about, as if judging time from the lie of sun and shadow on  the ground. \"We shall return in the morning when the shadow lies here.\"  With the toe of his high moccasin he made an impression in the soft  earth. Then, without any formal farewell, he strode off, the others fast  on his heels.    \"He is your chief, that one?\" Kaydessa asked, pointing after Buck.    \"He is one having a large voice in council,\" Travis replied. He set  about building up the cooking fire, bringing out the body of a  split-horn calf which had been left them. Menlik sat on his heels by the  pool, dipping up drinking water with his hand. Now he squinted his eyes  against the probe of the sun.    \"It will require much talking to win over the short one,\" he observed.  \"That one does not like us or your plan. Just as there will be those  among the Horde who will not like it either.\" He flipped water drops  from his fingers. \"But this I do know, man who calls himself Fox, if we  do not make a common cause, then we have no hope of going against the  Reds. It will be for them as a man crushing fleas.\" He brought his hand  down on his knee in emphatic slaps. \"So ... and so ... and so!\"    \"This do I think also,\" Travis admitted.    \"So let us both hope that all men will be as wise as we,\" Menlik said,  smiling. \"And since we can take a hand in that decision, this remains a  time for rest.\"    The shaman might be content to sleep the afternoon away, but after he  had eaten, Hulagur wandered up and down the valley, making a lengthy  business of rubbing down their horses with twists of last season's  grass. Now and then he paused beside Kaydessa and spoke, his uneasiness  plain to Travis although he could not understand the words.    Travis had settled down in the shade, half dozing, yet alert to every  movement of the three Tatars. He tried not to think of what might be  happening in the rancheria by switching his mind to that misty valley of  the towers. Did any of those three alien structures contain such a grab  bag of the past as he, Ashe, and Murdock had found on that other world  where the winged people had gathered together for them the artifacts of  an older civilization? At that time he had created for their hosts a new  weapon of defense, turning metal tubes into blow-guns. It had been  there, too, where he had chanced upon the library of tapes, one of which  had eventually landed Travis and his people here on Topaz.    Even if he did find racks of such tapes in one of those towers, there  would be no way of using them--with the ship wrecked on the mountain  side. Only--Travis' fingers itched where they lay quiet on his  knees--there might be other things waiting. If he were only free to  explore!    He reached out to touch Menlik's shoulder. The shaman half turned,  opening his eyes with the languid effort of a sleepy cat. But the spark  of intelligence awoke in them quickly.    \"What is it?\"    For a moment Travis hesitated, already regretting his impulse. He did  not know how much Menlik remembered of the present. Remember of the  present--one part of the Apache's mind was wryly amused at that snarled  estimate of their situation. Men who had been dropped into their racial  and ancestral pasts until the present time was less real than the  dreams conditioning them had a difficult job evaluating any situation.  But since Menlik had clung to his knowledge of English, he must be less  far down that stairway.    \"When we met you, Kaydessa and I, it was outside that valley.\" Travis  was still of two minds about this questioning, but the Tatar camp had  been close to the towers and there was a good chance the Mongols had  explored them. \"And inside were buildings ... very old....\"    Menlik was fully alert now. He took his wand, played with it as he  spoke:    \"That is, or was, a place of much power, Fox. Oh, I know that you  question my kinship with the spirits and the powers they give. But one  learns not to dispute what one feels here--and here--\" His long,  somewhat grimy fingers went to his forehead and then to the bare brown  chest where his shirt fell open. \"I have walked the stone path in that  valley, and there have been the whispers--\"    \"Whispers?\"    Menlik twirled the wand. \"Whispers which are too low for many ears to  distinguish. You can hear them as one hears the buzzing of an insect,  but never the words--no, never the words! But that is a place of great  power!\"    \"A place to explore!\"    But Menlik watched only his wand. \"That I wonder, Fox, truly do I  wonder. This is not our world. And here there may be that which does not  welcome us.\"    Tricks-in-trade of a shaman? Or was it true recognition of something  beyond human description? Travis could not be sure, but he knew that he  must return to the valley and see for himself.    \"Listen,\" Menlik said, leaning closer, \"I have heard your tale, that  you were on that first ship, the one which brought you unwilling along  the old star paths. Have you ever seen such a thing as this?\"    He smoothed a space of soft earth and with the narrow tip of his wand  began to draw. Whatever role Menlik had played in the present before he  had been reconditioned into a shaman of the Horde, he had had the  ability of an artist, for with a minimum of lines he created a figure in  that sketch.    It was a man or at least a figure with general human outlines. But the  round, slightly oversized skull was bare, the clothing skintight to  reveal unnaturally thin limbs. There were large eyes, small nose and  mouth, rather crowded into the lower third of the head, giving an  impression of an over-expanded brain case above. And it was familiar.    Not the flying men of the other world, certainly not the nocturnal  ape-things. Yet for all its alien quality Travis was sure he had seen  its like before. He closed his eyes and tried to visualize it apart from  lines in the soil.    Such a head, white, almost like the bone of a skull laid bare, such a  head lying face down on a bone-thin arm clad in a blue-purple skintight  sleeve. Where had he seen it?    The Apache gave a sharp exclamation as he remembered fully. The derelict  spaceship as he had first found it--the dead alien officer had still  been seated at its controls! The alien who had set the tape which took  them out into that forgotten empire--he was the subject of Menlik's  drawing!    \"Where? When did you see such a one?\" The Apache bent down over the  Tatar.    Menlik looked troubled. \"He came into my mind when I walked the valley.  I thought I could almost see such a face in one of the tower windows,  but of that I am not sure. Who is it?\"    \"Someone from the old days--those who once ruled the stars,\" Travis  answered. But were they still here then, the remnant of a civilization  which had flourished ten thousand years ago? Were the Baldies, who  centuries ago had hunted down so ruthlessly the Russians who had dared  to loot their wrecked ships, still on Topaz?    He remembered the story of Ross Murdock's escape from those aliens in  the far past of Europe, and he shivered. Murdock was tough, steel tough,  yet his own description of that epic chase and the final meeting had  carried with it"]]]
