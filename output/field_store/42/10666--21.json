It seems indeed awful, dear M., to be compelled to announce to you the  death of one of the four women forming the female population of this  Bar. I have just returned from the funeral of poor Mrs. B., who died of  peritonitis (a common disease in this place), after an illness of four  days only. Our hostess herself heard of her sickness but two days  since. On her return from a visit which she had paid to the invalid,  she told me that although Mrs. B.'s family did not seem alarmed about  her, in her opinion she would survive but a few hours. Last night we  were startled by the frightful news of her decease. I confess that,  without being very egotistical, the death of one, out of a community of  four women, might well alarm the remainder.    Her funeral took place at ten this morning. The family reside in a log  cabin at the head of the Bar, and although it has no window, all the  light admitted entering through an aperture where there _will_ be a  door when it becomes cold enough for such a luxury, yet I am told, and  can easily believe, that it is one of the most _comfortable_ residences  in the place. I observed it particularly, for it was the first log  cabin that I had ever seen. Everything in the room, though of the  humblest description, was exceedingly clean and neat.    On a board, supported by two butter-tubs, was extended the body of the  dead woman, covered with a sheet. By its side stood the coffin, of  unstained pine, lined with white cambric. You, who have alternately  laughed and scolded at my provoking and inconvenient deficiency in the  power of observing, will perhaps wonder at the minuteness of my  descriptions; but I know how deeply you are interested in everything  relating to California, and therefore I take pains to describe things  exactly as I _see_ them, hoping that thus you will obtain an idea of  life in the mines _as it is_.    The bereaved husband held in his arms a sickly babe ten months old,  which was moaning piteously for its mother. The other child, a  handsome, bold-looking little girl six years of age, was running gayly  around the room, perfectly unconscious of her great bereavement. A  sickening horror came over me, to see her, every few moments, run up to  her dead mother and peep laughingly under the handkerchief that covered  her moveless face. Poor little thing! It was evident that her  baby-toilet had been made by men. She had on a new calico dress, which,  having no tucks in it, trailed to the floor, and gave her a most  singular and dwarf-womanly appearance.    About twenty men, with the three women of the place, had assembled at  the funeral. An extempore prayer was made, filled with all the  peculiarities usual to that style of petition. Ah, how different from  the soothing verses of the glorious burial service of the church!    As the procession started for the hillside graveyard, a dark cloth  cover, borrowed from a neighboring monte-table, was flung over the  coffin. Do not think that I mention any of these circumstances in a  spirit of mockery. Far from it. Every observance usual on such  occasions, that was _procurable_, surrounded this funeral. All the gold  on Rich Bar could do no more; and should I die to-morrow, I should be  marshaled to my mountain-grave beneath the same monte-table-cover pall  which shrouded the coffin of poor Mrs. B.    I almost forgot to tell you how painfully the feelings of the assembly  were shocked by the sound of the nails (there being no screws at any of  the shops) driven with a hammer into the coffin while closing it. It  seemed as if it _must_ disturb the pale sleeper within.    To-day I called at the residence of Mrs. R. It is a canvas house  containing a suite of three \"apartments,\" as Dick Swiveller would say,  which, considering that they were all on the ground-floor, are kept  surprisingly neat. There is a barroom blushing all over with red  calico, a dining-room, kitchen, and a small bed-closet. The little  sixty-eight-pounder woman is queen of the establishment. By the way, a  man who walked home with us was enthusiastic in her praise.  \"Magnificent woman, that, sir,\" he said, addressing my husband; \"a wife  of the right sort, _she_ is. Why,\" he added, absolutely rising into  eloquence as he spoke, \"she earnt her _old man_\" (said individual  twenty-one years of age, perhaps) \"nine hundred dollars in nine weeks,  clear of all expenses, by washing! Such women ain't common, I tell  _you_. If they were, a man might marry, and make money by the  operation.\" I looked at this person with somewhat the same kind of  _inverted_ admiration wherewith Leigh Hunt was wont to gaze upon that  friend of his \"who used to elevate the commonplace to a pitch of the  sublime,\" and he looked at _me_ as if to say, that, though by no means  gloriously arrayed, I was a mere cumberer of the ground, inasmuch as I  toiled not, neither did I wash. Alas! I hung my diminished head,  particularly when I remembered the eight dollars a dozen which I had  been in the habit of paying for the washing of linen-cambric  pocket-handkerchiefs while in San Francisco. But a lucky thought came  into my mind. As all men cannot be Napoleon Bonapartes, so all women  cannot be _manglers_. The majority of the sex must be satisfied with  simply being _mangled_. Reassured by this idea, I determined to meekly  and humbly pay the amount per dozen required to enable this really  worthy and agreeable little woman \"to lay up her hundred dollars a  week, clear of expenses.\" But is it not wonderful what femininity is  capable of? To look at the tiny hands of Mrs. R., you would not think  it possible that they could wring out anything larger than a doll's  nightcap; but, as is often said, nothing is strange in California. I  have known of sacrifices requiring, it would seem, superhuman efforts,  made by women in this country, who, at home, were nurtured in the  extreme of elegance and delicacy.    Mr. B. called on us to-day with little Mary. I tried to make her, at  least, look sad as I talked about her mother; but although she had seen  the grave closed over her coffin (for a friend of her father's had  carried her in his arms to the burial), she seemed laughingly  indifferent to her loss. Being myself an orphan, my heart contracted  painfully at her careless gayety when speaking of her dead parent, and  I said to our hostess, \"What a cold-blooded little wretch it is!\" But  immediately my conscience struck me with remorse. Poor orphaned one!  Poor bereaved darling! Why should I so cruelly wish to darken her young  life with that knowledge which a few years' experience will so  painfully teach her? \"All _my_ mother came into my eyes\" as I bent down  and kissed the white lids which shrouded her beautiful dark orbs, and,  taking her fat little hand in mine, I led her to my room, where, in the  penitence of my heart, I gave her everything that she desired. The  little chatterer was enchanted, not having had any new playthings for a  long while. It was beautiful to hear her pretty exclamations of ecstasy  at the sight of some tiny scent-bottles, about an inch in length, which  she called baby decanters.    Mr. B. intends, in a day or two, to take his children to their  grandmother, who resides somewhere near Marysville, I believe. This is  an awful place for children, and nervous mothers would \"die daily\" if  they could see little Mary running fearlessly to the very edge of, and  looking down into, these holes (many of them sixty feet in depth),  which have been excavated in the hope of finding gold, and of course  left open.

Letter _the_ Sixth    USE _of_ PROFANITY--UNCERTAINTY _of_ MINING    RICH BAR, EAST BRANCH _of the_ NORTH FORK _of_ FEATHER RIVER,    _September_ 30, 1851.      I think that I have never spoken to you of the mournful extent to which  profanity prevails in California. You know that at home it is  considered _vulgar_ for a gentleman to swear; but I am told that here  it is absolutely the fashion, and that people who never uttered an oath  in their lives while in the \"States,\" now clothe themselves with curses  as with a garment. Some try to excuse themselves by saying that it is a  careless habit, into which they have glided imperceptibly from having  been compelled to associate so long with the vulgar and the profane;  that it is a mere slip of the tongue, which means absolutely nothing;  etc. I am willing to believe this, and to think as charitably as  possible of many persons here, who have unconsciously adopted a custom  which I know they abhor. Whether there is more profanity in the mines  than elsewhere, I know not; but, during the short time that I have been  at Rich Bar, I have _heard_ more of it than in all my life before. Of  course the most vulgar blackguard will abstain from swearing in the  _presence_ of a lady, but in this rag-and-cardboard house one is  _compelled_ to hear the most sacred of names constantly profaned by the  drinkers and gamblers, who haunt the barroom at all hours. And this is  a custom which the gentlemanly and quiet proprietor, much as he  evidently dislikes it, cannot possibly prevent.

He came out of the place, however, empty-handed, and  looking more sour than ever. In the meantime Jack sauntered up to the  keeper of the stand at the railroad station.    \"Not a very pleasant sort of a fellow, that,\" he remarked.    \"Say, that fellow makes me tired!\" growled the newsstand man. \"I have  a run-in with him nearly every time he comes here. The last time it  was over a plugged ten-cent piece he tried to pass on me. When I  handed it back to him and told him I wanted a good one, he was as  peppery as sin.\"    A minute or two later the driver of the auto-stage tooted his horn to  show that he was about ready to start on the trip. At once several men  and women came running from various directions and began to enter the  stage. The last man to arrive was Asa Lemm. He had picked up a valise  and a bundle from somewhere, and he had to stand in the rear, waiting  for those ahead to enter the stage.    \"I suppose there won't be any seat for me by the time I get aboard,\"  he grumbled to the driver.    \"Ain't my fault,\" answered the stage driver calmly. \"If you don't want  to stand, you can wait until the next trip.\"    \"I haven't time to wait. I'll crowd in somehow,\" grumbled Asa Lemm.    While this was going on, Andy and Randy had come up close behind the  professor. Both were wondering if they could not play some sort of  trick on him before he departed.    The newsstand was similar to many of that kind, and on two sides of it  were long rows of periodicals, fastened by clips to a wire held in  place by small hooks. Watching his chance, Andy unfastened the end of  one of these wires, and motioned to his twin to unhook the other end.    \"Now I guess we'll fix Mr. Asa Lemm!\" muttered Andy, and with a quick  move he came up behind the former teacher of Colby Hall and twisted  one end of the wire around a back button of Asa Lemm's cutaway coat.    By this time all of the others had gotten into the stage, and, being  somewhat in a hurry, the driver made a move as if to start away.    \"Hi there! Wait till I get in!\" shouted Asa Lemm and threw his bags  and his bundle into the stage. Then he got on to the stage step and  the driver started off.    \"Hello, look at that!\"    \"Say, what is that fellow dragging behind him?\"    \"Hi, Mr. Gasaway! That fellow is running away with your magazines!\"    \"Talk about the tail of a kite--this beats any kite tail I ever saw!\"    [Illustration: \"TALK ABOUT THE TAIL OF A KITE--THIS BEATS ANY  KITE TAIL I EVER SAW!\" _Page 139_]    Such were some of the cries that rent the air as the stage started  away from the depot. On the step, clutching the handrails, was Asa  Lemm, and streaming out behind him was the wire, loaded with magazines  and picture papers.    \"Hi you! Come back here!\" roared the stand keeper in bewilderment.  \"What do you mean by running off with my stuff? Come back, I say!\"  and, throwing up a flap of the counter, he ran out of his stand and  after the auto-stage.    Asa Lemm did not know what to make of the hullaballoo. People were  rushing toward the stage from all directions, and many were pointing  their fingers at him. He felt a tug in the rear, but could not put his  hand back to the button on which the wire was fastened for fear of  falling from the stage step.    \"Stop that stage! Stop that stage, I tell you!\" bawled the newsstand  keeper. \"He's running off with my magazines!\"    And then the crowd set up a roar of laughter.    \"I ain't got no time to waste. I'm behind time already!\" yelled back  the auto-stage driver. \"What do you want, anyway?\"    \"Oh, my! did you ever?\" screamed Martha, dropping several of the  postcards she had purchased.    \"Just look at all those magazines dangling after that man!\" screamed  Mary. And then, as she caught sight of Andy and Randy, both doubled up  with laughter, she continued: \"I'm sure those twins must have done  it!\"    Jack and Fred had also come up, and both were on a broad grin. In the  meanwhile the stage moved on with Asa Lemm still dragging the wire and  the periodicals attached to it behind him.    \"Hurrah! he believes in loading up on information!\" cried Andy gaily.    \"He's what you can call a real live wire!\" added his twin.    \"Come back with those magazines, I tell you!\" bawled the stand keeper,  shaking his fist at Asa Lemm. \"Come back, I say!\" And then he set off  on a run after the stage.    He could not catch up to the vehicle, but he did catch up to the end  of the wire, and as he stepped on this there was a tearing sound from  beyond, and away came the button from Asa Lemm's coat, bringing with  it a strip of cloth.    \"Hurrah, he's got his magazines back!\" exclaimed Randy.    \"And a souvenir of Asa Lemm's coat to remember him by!\" added his  brother.    Just as Andy said this a train came rolling into the station.    \"I hope that is our train,\" cried Fred.    The boys ran around to the other side of the station and found out  from the conductor that the train which had come in was that for which  they had been waiting. They at once called to the girls; and all lost  no time in hurrying on board.    \"Wait! I want to see the end of this!\" cried Andy, and threw up a  window. He stuck out his head, and as the train rolled away from  Raymonton he was just in time to see Asa Lemm pulled from the step of  the auto-stage by the irate man from the newsstand. Then the former  Hall professor was tripped up and sent flat on his back in the dust of  the road.          CHAPTER XIV    BACK TO COLBY HALL      \"Well, that is where we got back at Asa Lemm!\" cried Randy, after all  of the Rovers had gazed out of the car windows as long as the scene  near the auto-stage remained in view.    \"I'll wager that stand keeper is mad,\" said Jack.    \"And what a beautiful coat old Lemm has, with the tail torn to  ribbons!\" Fred added.    \"Oh, I think you boys are simply dreadful!\" cried Mary, but she smiled  as she spoke.    \"Don't you think you were rather hard on the professor?\" questioned  Martha dubiously.    \"No, I don't!\" answered Andy promptly. \"He treated us as mean as dirt  while he was at Colby Hall. He was more than stern--he was thoroughly  unreasonable! That's why Colonel Colby discharged him.\"    \"And please to remember how he backed up Slugger Brown's father on  Snowshoe Island,\" added Randy. \"He was perfectly willing to swindle  old Barney Stevenson out of his property. He deserves no sympathy.\"    The remainder of the journey to Haven Point passed without special  incident. The boys and the girls had sent word ahead that they were  coming, and when they reached the town they found Bob Nixon there with  one of the Colby Hall turnouts, and also a driver with a stage from  the girls' school.    \"Well, here is where we part and get back to the grind,\" said Fred,  after he and Jack had placed their sisters' baggage in the proper car.    \"Good luck to both of you girls!\" cried Jack.    The girls were soon started off in one direction, and then the boys  started off in the other. The latter were still some distance from  Colby Hall when they saw Spouter Powell and Gif Garrison approaching  on foot.    \"Glad to see you back!\" cried Spouter, as he climbed into the machine.    \"We've got great news,\" announced Gif, his eyes beaming.    \"Our fathers have volunteered for the war!\" broke out Spouter.    \"Really?\" came from the Rover boys.    All were much interested, although Andy and Randy looked a trifle  disturbed. The fact that their own father would have to remain behind  while all of the others were going to the front was continually in the  minds of the twins. They felt much disappointed.    \"When did you get the news?\" questioned Jack.    \"It came in by the first mail this morning,\" returned Spouter. \"I got  a letter, and so did Gif. My father and Mr. Garrison are both going to  do their best to join the crowd from Putnam Hall and Brill College.\"    Of course the Rovers wanted to know more particulars, and they were  given so far as Spouter and Gif knew them.    \"And we've got more news, too,\" announced Gif. \"They've finally  settled on the place where we are to have our annual encampment.\"    \"And where will that be?\" asked Randy eagerly.    \"We're to go to Barlight Bay on the Atlantic coast. It's quite a  distance from here.\"    \"Barlight Bay!\" exclaimed Jack. And then he looked inquiringly at  Fred. \"Isn't that in the vicinity of Camp Huxwell?\"    \"Sure it is!\" answered Fred. \"They are almost side by side.\"    \"I asked about that,\" said Spouter; \"and Captain Dale told me that our  camp and the government camp will be not very far apart. There is a  thick belt of timber and some rocky land between.\"    \"Why then, we'll be close to our fathers!\" cried Fred joyfully. \"This  suits me right down to the ground!\" and his face showed his delight.    \"Gee, I wish we were going under canvas to-morrow!\" sighed Jack.    The next day found the Rovers deep in their studies. The examinations  previous to the annual encampment were now close at hand, and all were  anxious to make a good showing.    \"Because, you see, it's this way,\" said Jack to his cousins, and  especially to the fun-loving twins. \"We didn't come here merely to cut  up and have a good time. Our folks sent us to Colby Hall so that we  would settle down and get good educations. If we don't make a good  showing, you know how disappointed every one of them will be.\"    \"Oh, I'm going to study like an Indian,\" answered Andy quickly. \"I'm  going to cut out every bit of horseplay until after the examinations  are over.\"    \"And so am I,\" added Randy.    And, strange as it may seem, the twins kept their word, and as a  result, when the examinations were held for the term, both came  through with markings which were exceedingly gratifying.    Jack and Fred likewise did very well, for which they were thankful.  They telephoned the results to their sisters, and got"]]]
