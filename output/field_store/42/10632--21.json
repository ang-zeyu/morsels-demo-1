The notices all over the place are strangely reminiscent of,       say, the Black Forest--\"Baekerei,\" \"Conditorei,\" &c., and yet       it is the heart of tropical Africa. None of the natives,       strange to say, talk German; all pigeon English. The Hausa       boys are splendid chaps, as different from the Duala boys or       Sierra Leone boys as chalk from cheese. Smile and make an       idiotic but beautiful remark, they rush with a roar of       laughter for the biggest load.         We get some beautiful sunset effects here. At sundown night       before last, on the sea near mouth of river, it was       absolutely gorgeous with the purple mountains standing       clear out against the orange and emerald sky and the dark       gray shapes of our ships lying sombrely in the background,       talking to each other in flashing Morse. The great mountain,       Fernando Po, standing up out of the water to starboard and       the Peak of Cameroon (13,760 feet) wreathed in mist to port;       Victoria invisible, as also Buea--both hidden behind the       clouds as we passed disdainfully by and entered the estuary       of the Cameroon River.    As an added detail for West Africa, it should be recorded that, on  March 19, a combined French and Belgian force occupied Molundu in the  German Congo territory, and Ngaundere on June 29.      III. WITH BOTHA IN SOUTHWEST AFRICA.    On July 13 a resolution, moved by Premier Asquith, was passed by  acclamation in the House of Commons thanking General Louis Botha,  General Smuts and the forces of the Union of South Africa for their  work in \"the remarkable campaign which has just been brought to a  remarkable and glorious conclusion.\" Premier Asquith concluded:         The German dominion of Southwest Africa has ceased to exist.       I ask the House to testify to the admiration of the whole       empire for its gratitude to the illustrious General who has       rendered such an inestimable service to the empire, which he       entered by adoption and of which he has become one of the       most honored and cherished sons, and to his dauntless and       much enduring troops, whether of Burgher or British birth,       who fought like brethren, side by side, in the cause which       is equally dear to them as to us--the broadening of the       bounds of human liberty.    The event which the British Premier thus read into the minutes of  history marks the end of a campaign begun by General Botha on Sept.  27, when troops of the Union of South Africa first entered German  territory. On Christmas Day Walfisch (Whale) Bay was occupied, and on  Jan. 14 Swakopmund, a military railroad joining them being finished a  month later.    [Illustration: The German Colonial Possessions]    The progress of General Botha's campaign from the south and west is  thus summarized by The Sphere (July 3):         The occupation of Windhoek was effected by General Botha's       North Damaraland forces working along the railway from       Swakopmund. At the former place General Vanderventer       joined up with General Botha's forces. The force from       Swakopmund met with considerable opposition, first at       Tretskopje, a small township in the great Namib Desert fifty       miles to the northeast of Swakopmund, and secondly at       Otjimbingwe, on the Swakop River, sixty miles northwest of       Windhoek.         [Illustration: The theatre of operations in German South       West Africa.]         Apart from these two determined stands, however, little       other opposition was encountered, and Karibib was occupied       on May 5 and Okahandja and Windhoek on May 12. With the fall       of the latter place 3,000 Europeans and 12,000 natives       became prisoners.         The wireless station--one of Germany's most valuable       high-power stations, which was able to communicate with one       relay only with Berlin--was captured almost intact, and much       rolling stock also fell into the hands of the Union forces.         The advance from the south along the       Luederitzbucht-Seeheim-Keetmanshoop Railway, approximately       500 miles in length, was made by two forces which joined       hands at Keetmanshoop. The advance from Aus (captured on       April 1) was made by General Smuts's forces. Colonel       (afterward General) Vanderventer, moving up from the       direction of Warmbad and Kalkfontein, around the flanks of       Karas Mountain, pushed on after reaching Keetmanshoop in the       direction of Gibeon. Bethany had previously been occupied       during the advance to Seeheim. At Kabus, twenty miles to the       north of Keetmanshoop, and at Gibeon pitched battles were       fought between General Vanderventer's forces and the enemy.       No other opposition of importance was encountered, and the       operations were brought to a successful conclusion at       Windhoek.    A part of the German forces had retreated to the northward, intending  to carry on guerrilla warfare in the hills. General Botha went in  pursuit. A Reuter's telegram, dated June 26, announced that  Otjivarongo, approximately 120 miles north of Karibib, on the Otavi  Railway, was occupied on that day by General Botha, the enemy having  retired northward during the previous night. General Botha's movements  have again been characterized by rapid and extraordinary marching  through dense bush country, which is almost waterless. The retirement  of the enemy was more suggestive of a flight than a strategic retreat.    A telegram from Lord Buxton, the Governor General of the Union of  South Africa, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, concludes  the story:         This morning, July 9, General Botha accepted from Governor       Seitz the surrender of all the German forces in Southwest       Africa. Hostilities have ceased and the campaign has thus       been brought to a successful conclusion.    The newly conquered territory, which is half as large again as the  German Empire, is destined to become a part of the South African  Union. As a great part of it is 5,000 feet above sea level, it is well  adapted for white settlers. Its chief resources are diamond mines and  grazing.    General Botha's force is likely to be divided between the European  seat of war, to which the South African Union has up to the present  sent no troops, and German East Africa, much of which still remains in  the hands of the Germans.      IV. GERMAN EAST AFRICA.    The early stage of the struggle for German East Africa is lucidly  summarized in The Sphere for May 8:         The fighting in British East Africa (immediately north of       the German colony) may be said to have really begun toward       the end of September, 1914, when the Germans made a       determined attempt to capture Mombasa, the commercial       capital of British East Africa and the terminus of the       Uganda Railway.         Previous to this, somewhat half-hearted attempts had been       made by them to wreck the railway line at various points,       destroy the telegraph, and occupy Voi and Mombasa. The       Germans, who were in strong force, were, however, for       various reasons, unable to cut the railway or even to       destroy the bridge across the Tsava River, and they were       beaten back both at Voi and the post at Taveta.         The attack on Mombasa itself was repulsed at Gazi, some       twenty-five miles to the southwest. The German plan of       action was to move up the road from Vanga to Mombasa,       arriving at the latter place somewhere about the time the       Koenigsburg was expected to arrive and bombard it from the       sea. The Koenigsburg was, of course, prevented from doing       this by the proximity of British warships, and the land       attack was also frustrated.         The Germans were held at Nargerimi by a mere handful of       Arabs and King's African Rifles--about 300 men all       told--until the arrival of the Indian troops strengthened       our position and the enemy was beaten back to his original       lines.         The next big actions were the British attack on Tanga and       Jassin very early in November; this was the direct outcome       of the German attack on Mombasa. Tanga is a post of       considerable importance in German East Africa, and lies       midway between Zanzibar and Mombasa. It is the seaport of an       important railway line which connects it with Moshi, lying       among the foothills of Kilimanjaro (18,700 feet) and which       taps most of the intervening country.         The force dispatched for the attack on Tanga consisted of       4,000 Indian Imperial Service troops, 1,000 Indian regulars,       together with 1,000 white regulars. The force took no kit of       any kind except rations. It was disembarked from the       troopship near Tanga, and then moved against the position.         The day the British attacked, however, 1,000 Germans had       been rushed up from Moshi and then took up a position to the       right of the town. With them were great numbers of       quick-firing guns of various sorts. This unexpected       reinforcement made the capture of Tanga almost impossible by       the forces present. During the fight many casualties were       incurred on both sides.         As regards the advance against Tanga and Jassin, the German       forces which had previously advanced on Mombasa were, up to       as recently as January, maintaining themselves in the valley       of the Umba River. To drive them from their positions a       column of 1,800 men, composed of Indians and King's African       Rifles, with artillery, was dispatched.         After gaining Jassin and leaving a garrison of 300 men, the       post was attacked and subsequently surrendered to a force of       2,000 Germans. The minor operations along the       Anglo-German frontier include the attack on Shirati--a       German post on the southeast shore of Lake"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#17)"],[1,"and her mamma put on when they  perceived us!... With an air of solemnity that was really delightful,  they each offered us the tip of one finger for us to shake, and spoke  with such affectation that their words stumbled one against the other.  Their vocabulary was evidently restricted, and in order to make the  conversation elegant they interpolated high-sounding words which did not  exactly belong, but sounded grand in their ears. It was a trial to have  to remain serious.    Dinner was served--always the same fare wherever you went. Boiled rice  (very badly boiled), beans, stewed chicken chopped up, _pimienta_  (peppers), fried eggs and Indian corn flour, which one mixed up together  on one's plate and rendered into a paste. The coffee was always plentiful  and good, but so strong that it was quite bitter.    By the light of a wick burning and smoking terribly from the neck of an  ex-medicine bottle filled with oil, we enjoyed our meal, watched intently  by the entire family, silent and flattened in semi-obscurity against the  walls. The primitive lamp gave so little light--although it gave abundant  smell--that the many figures were almost indistinguishable against the  dirty background, and all one perceived on raising one's eyes from the  dinner-plate was a row of expanded eyes, following the movements of our  hands, and just under that row a row of white teeth.    When seen in a stronger light it was curious to notice criminal  characteristics on nearly every face one saw; in the servants at those  farmhouses one frequently observed murderous-looking creatures whom one  would not care to meet alone in the dark. They were a special breed of  stranded outcasts who had drifted there--the outcome of a complex mixture  of Portuguese, former black slaves, and Indians. When you realized that  the people who had drifted into the interior were the worst Portuguese,  the worst blacks, and the Indians who intermarried with these gentry the  worst Indians, you can well imagine what fine results could be expected  from such a breed.    One trait predominant among these people was the unreasonable jealousy of  the men over their women. Had they been so many Venuses of Milo the men  could not have guarded them with more ferocity. I am sure it would take a  brave man indeed, and, above all, a totally blind man, to fall in love  with the farmers' wives, daughters, or servants of the Province of Goyaz.    I must say this in favour of my Brazilian men, that, whatever other  faults they may have had, they always, behaved in a most chivalrous,  dignified way with the women-folk we met. Never once did I have to  reprimand them.    In the morning, as the cows were driven into the yard to be milked, and  the calves were being suckled by their mothers, and the children, rubbing  their sleepy eyes with the backs of their hands, scrambled out of the  house upon their drowsy legs, the girls of the family brought the last  cups of coffee to us departing strangers. We packed our animals, paid the  bill, and were off again.    On April 7th we crossed the Piracanjuga River, another tributary of the  Corumba, 50 yards wide, flowing from north-east to south-west, at an  elevation of 2,300 ft. One league (6 kil. 600 m.) farther on we crossed  another stream flowing east, in its turn a tributary of the Piracanjuga.    One of the most beautiful trees in that region was the _caneleira_, of  the family of the _Laurineas_. Beautiful, too, were the _oleo pardo_ and  _vermelho_ (_Myrocarpus frondosus_ and _Myrospermum erythrozylon_).    We were next treated to a view of an extensive, deliciously green valley,  most excellent for grazing purposes, extending from north to south to the  west of our route. In the central depression of this valley were _burity_  palms in abundance. They say that wherever you find a burity you are sure  to find water. It is perfectly true, as the burity only flourishes where  there is a good deal of moisture in the soil.    Having crossed a low pass, we found ourselves in another valley--this one  sparsely wooded (2,500 ft. above the sea level), very beautiful, with  undulations some 200 ft. high, and with streamlets at the bottom of most  of the undulations. The summit of the highest elevation on that  undulating land was 2,750 ft., the level of the principal streamlet 2,600  ft. above the sea.          CHAPTER VI         Inquisitiveness--Snakes--A Wonderful Cure--Butterflies--A       Striking Scene      TWENTY-NINE kilometres from the \"Merry Rest\" we arrived at the little  town of Pouso Alto--duly translated \"high camp\"--situated 2,750 ft. above  the sea level on an elevation between the two rivers Piracanjuba, and the  Furmiga (which afterwards became the Rio Meio Ponte), throwing itself  into the Paranahyba River.    Pouso Alto was like all the other _villas_ or settlements of Goyaz, only  perhaps a little larger. The same whitewashed houses with doors and  windows decorated with blue, the same abandoned, deserted look of the  principal square and streets; in fact, another \"city of the dead.\" Only  two men--drinking in the local store--were visible in the whole village.    The usual impertinent questions had to be answered.    \"Who are you? Why do you come here? Is your country as beautiful as ours?  Have you any cities as large as ours in your country? How much money have  you? Are you married? You are English; then you come here to steal our  gold and diamonds.\"    \"Have you any gold and diamonds here?\"    \"No!\"    \"No, you cannot travel for pleasure. The English only travel to take away  all the riches from other countries! Those instruments you carry\" (a  compass and two aneroids) \"are those that tell you where to dig for  gold!\"    I could not help remarking to this gentleman that so far the country I  had traversed seemed merely to be rich in misery, that was all.    Nothing could be imagined more funereal than those little towns. My men  intended remaining there for the night, but I insisted on pushing on for  a few more kilometres--especially as in these places my men were led to  drink and became unmanageable. On we went for 9 kil. to the farm of  Bellianti (elev. 2,500 ft. above the sea level).    On April 8th we made an early start and travelled through a luxuriant  forest, which was daily getting more and more tropical as we went farther  north. We were, of course, do not forget, south of the equator.    Thirteen kilometres from camp we crossed the Rio Furmiga (or Meio Ponte)  about 100 yards wide, flowing there in a direction from east to west at  an elevation of 2,000 ft. Most gorgeous, richly verdant vegetation  overhung and festooned the banks of the stream.    As we went farther toward the interior the vegetation grew more  beautiful, the people more repulsive. The majority of the people suffered  from goitre in more or less advanced stages. Many were the persons  affected by leprosy.    We were in a region where oranges (imported, of course) of most excellent  juicy quality were obtainable--for instance at the farm of Felicidade  (elev. 2,350 ft.). All those farms--very old--showed signs of having  seen better days--no doubt when slavery existed in a legal form in Brazil  and it was possible to work those estates profitably. With the  prohibitive price of labour--and in fact the impossibility of obtaining  labour at any price in the interior--farming cannot indeed flourish  to-day. The comparatively few immigrants who landed at the various ports  in Brazil were at once absorbed near the coast, and seldom left the port  of landing, where labour was anxiously required.    For the first time, that day did I see two snakes, which were concealed  in the deep grooves left by a cart wheel. One wound itself around the  front leg of my mule, and for a moment I was anxious lest the animal had  been bitten; but fortunately the snake, which had been trodden upon, did  no damage. Only rarely did we see a bird anywhere, except in villages,  where an occasional crow, with its dried-up neck and jerky motions, could  be seen. How like the inhabitants those birds were!    [Illustration: Brazilian Pack-saddles.]    [Illustration: A Typical Village.    (The higher building is the church.)]    Twenty-seven kilometres farther we reached Santo Antonio, a village  situated in quite a heavenly spot, 2,800 ft. above the sea level, but in  itself one of the most miserable villages I have ever seen. There were  altogether some forty houses scattered about, eight of which were along  the sides of the principal square--an abandoned field. The church had the  appearance of a disused barn. A large wooden cross stood in front of it,  upon which birds had built their nests. Four thin, anaemic-looking palms  stood at different angles by the side of the cross. We had the misfortune  to stay there for the night. By seven o'clock everybody had barricaded  their houses and had retired to sleep. There was, of course, no such  thing as a post-office or a telegraph in the place. The nearest place  where a letter could be posted was some 72 kil. away on the high road  between Goyaz and Catalao. Goats tied in pairs, with a log of wood  between in order to keep them apart, seemed to have the run of the place,  and were the only things there which appeared to have any life in them.    But if the place was miserable, if the natives were repulsive and dull,  there was plenty to be thankful for in admiration of the really glorious  country around, and the superb sunsets to which we were treated every  evening. Again that evening, when everybody in the place was slumbering,  the sunset was more wonderful than words can describe. The usual  radiations, which again reached the highest point of the sky's vault,  were that night white on the west, with corresponding ones of brilliant  cobalt blue to the east.    A drizzling rain rendered the night cold and damp, although the  Fahrenheit thermometer registered a minimum temperature of 70 deg.."]]]
