I shall certainly complain to  Miss Archer about it the first thing Monday morning.\"    \"All right, I'll meet you in Miss Archer's office the first thing after  chapel,\" answered Ellen, coolly, ignoring everything save the French  girl's final threat. \"Come along, girls.\" She beckoned to the other  members of her team, who had listened in blank amazement to the bold  accusation. With her head held high, a careless smile on her fine face,  Ellen marched through the crowd, which made way for her, and across the  gymnasium to the sophomores' room, accompanied by her team.    \"Isn't that a shame?\" burst out Jerry. \"Ellen will have an awful time to  prove herself innocent. She never touched Mignon. It was Mignon who  pushed her away. I saw her with my own eyes, and so did you, Marjorie.  Say,\" she looked blankly at Marjorie, \"do you suppose it's our duty to  go to Miss Archer and tell her what we saw?\"    \"I--don't--know.\" The words came doubtfully. \"Perhaps it will all blow  over. I hate to carry tales. Suppose we wait until Monday and see?  Mignon may change her mind. Even if she doesn't, Miss Archer may not  listen to her. But, if she should, then we'll have to do it, Jerry. It  wouldn't be fair to Ellen to keep still about it; I heard Miss Archer  tell mother Monday that she would not tolerate the least bit of  roughness in the girls' games. She knew of several schools where girls  had been tripped or knocked down and seriously hurt. She said that if  any reports of rough playing were brought to her she would 'deal  severely with the offender.' Those were her very words.\"    \"All right; we'll wait,\" agreed Jerry. \"I'm not crazy about reporting  even Mignon. Ellen can take care of herself, I guess.\"    So the matter was apparently settled for the time, and the four girls  strolled home discussing the various features of the game.    \"How did you like the game, Captain?\" she asked, saluting, as an hour  later she entered the living-room, where her mother sat reading.    \"Very well, indeed,\" replied her mother, laying down her magazine.  \"Neither Miss Archer nor I understand all the fine points of the game,  but we managed to keep track of most of the plays. By the way, Marjorie,  when you go to school on Monday morning, I wish you to take this  magazine to Miss Archer. It contains an article which I have marked for  her. It is quite in line with a discussion we had this afternoon.\"    \"I'll remember,\" promised Marjorie, and when Monday morning came she  kept her word, starting for school with the magazine under her arm.    \"I'll run up to Miss Archer's office with it after chapel,\" she decided.    When the morning service was over, Marjorie returned to the study hall,  and obtained Miss Merton's grudging permission to execute her  commission.    \"I wish to see Miss Archer,\" she said shortly, as Marcia Arnold looked  up from her writing just long enough to cast a half insolent glance of  inquiry in her direction.    \"You can't see her. She's busy.\"    The color flew to Marjorie's cheeks at the bold refusal. Her first  impulse was to turn and walk away. She could see Miss Archer later. Then  her natural independence asserted itself, and she determined to stand  her ground at least long enough to discover whether or not Miss Archer  were really too busy to be seen.    \"Then I'll wait here until she is at liberty.\"    Marcia frowned and seemed on the verge of further unpleasantness when  the sound of a buzzer from the inner office sent her hurrying toward it.  As she opened the door, Marjorie caught a fleeting glimpse of two  persons; one was Miss Archer, her face set and stern, the other Mignon  La Salle, her black eyes blazing with satisfaction.    \"Oh!\" gasped Marjorie, remembering Mignon's threat, \"she is reporting  poor Ellen.\"    The door swung open again and the secretary glided past her and out into  the corridor with the peculiar sliding gait that had caused Jerry to  liken her to a \"nice, wriggly snake.\"    \"She is going to bring Ellen here,\" guessed Marjorie.    Sure enough, within five minutes Marcia returned, followed by Ellen  Seymour, whose pale, defiant face meant battle. Again the door of the  inner office closed with a portending click. Marcia Arnold did not  return to the outer office.    Marjorie waited apprehensively, wondering if Ellen were holding her  own. Then to her utter amazement, the secretary appeared with a sulky,  \"Miss Archer wants you,\" and returned to her desk.    \"Good morning, Miss Dean,\" was the principal's grave salutation. \"I did  not know until I asked Miss Arnold to go for you that you were in the  outer office.\"    \"I have been waiting to give you the magazine that mother promised you.  She asked me to say to you that she had marked the article she wished  you to read.\"    \"Please thank your mother for me,\" returned Miss Archer, her face  relaxing, \"and thank you for bringing it. To return to why I sent for  you, you understand the game of basketball, do you not?\"    \"Yes,\" answered Marjorie, simply.    \"You have played on a team?\" inquired the principal.    \"Yes.\"    \"Did I not see you at practice with the freshmen shortly before the  game?\"    Marjorie colored hotly. \"I made the team, but afterward was asked to  resign because I did not play well enough.\"    \"Who asked you to resign?\"    \"The note was signed by the manager of the team.\"    \"And is that the reason you stopped playing?\" broke in Ellen Seymour,  with impulsive disregard for her surroundings. \"I might have known it.\"    Then she whirled upon Mignon in a burst of indignation as scathing as it  was unexpected.    \"How contemptible you are! I haven't the least doubt that you are to  blame for Miss Dean's leaving the team. You knew her to be a skilful  player and you were afraid she would outplay you. You know, too, that  when we jumped for the ball Saturday you purposely pushed me away from  it, almost throwing me down. It didn't do you the least bit of good, and  because you are spiteful you have set out to disgrace me and put a stain  on the sophomores' victory.\"    \"How dare you? You are not telling the truth! Prove your charge against  me, if you can,\" challenged Mignon, with blazing eyes.    \"It will be easier to prove than yours against me,\" flung back Ellen.    \"Girls, this is disgraceful! Not another word.\" Miss Archer's tone of  stern command had an immediate effect on the belligerents.    \"Please pardon me, Miss Archer.\" There was real contrition in Ellen's  voice. \"I didn't mean to be so rude. I lost control of my temper.\"    Mignon, however, made no apology. Her elfish eyes turned from Marjorie  to Ellen with an expression of concentrated hate.    \"Now, girls,\" began Miss Archer, firmly, \"we are going to settle this  difficulty here in my office before anyone of you goes back to her  classes. That is the reason I have sent for Miss Dean. When Miss La  Salle entered her complaint against you, Miss Seymour, I decided that  you should have a chance to speak in your own behalf. No sooner were you  brought face to face than one accused the other of treachery. From the  front row of the gallery, where I sat on the afternoon of the game, I  could see every move of the players, but my eyes were not sufficiently  trained to detect the roughness of which you accuse each other. Then I  remembered that Miss Dean sat next to me and that she was a seasoned  player. So I sent for her to ask her in your presence if she saw the  alleged roughness on the part of either of you.\"    There was a half-smothered exclamation of dismay from Marjorie. Ellen  was regarding her in mute appeal. Mignon's lips curled back in a sneer.  It was dreadful to remain under a cloud.    \"I am waiting for you to speak, Miss Dean.\"    Marjorie drew a long breath. \"Miss Seymour spoke the truth. I saw Miss  La Salle purposely push Miss Seymour away from the ball. Someone else  saw her, too--someone who sat on the other side of the gallery.\" Her  tones carried unmistakable truth with them.    \"It isn't true! It isn't true!\" Mignon's voice rose to an enraged  shriek. \"She only says so because she wants to pay me for making her  resign from the team.\"    \"What did I tell you?\" asked Ellen Seymour, triumphantly. \"She admits  that she was responsible for that resignation.\"    \"That will do,\" commanded Miss Archer, raising her hand.    Ellen subsided meekly.    Realizing that she had said too much, Mignon quieted as suddenly as she  had burst forth.    \"Miss Dean, are you perfectly sure of what you say?\" questioned Miss  Archer.    \"I am quite sure,\" was the steady answer.    A seemingly endless silence followed Marjorie's reply. The principal  surveyed the trio searchingly.    \"What girls comprise the freshman team?\" At last she put the question  coldly to Mignon.    The French girl sulkily named them. Miss Archer made note of their  names. The principal then pressed the buzzer that summoned her  secretary.    \"Send these young women to me at once,\" she directed, handing Marcia the  slip of paper.    Turning to the three girls before her she said, \"Miss Seymour, you may  go back to the study hall. Unless you hear from me further you are  exonerated from blame. I shall not need you either, Miss Dean. I am  sorry that I was obliged to involve you in this affair, but I am glad  that you were not afraid to tell the truth.\"    Marjorie turned to follow Ellen Seymour from the room, when the door  opened and the freshman basketball team filed in. For a brief instant  the principal's attention was fixed upon the entering girls, and in that  instant Mignon found time to mutter in Marjorie's ear, \"I'll never  forgive you for this and you'll be sorry. Just wait and see if you're  not.\"          CHAPTER XV    MARJORIE'S WONDERFUL DISCOVERY      What transpired in Miss Archer's private office on that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23650"],[0,"Ten Boys from History (#17)"],[1,"cry, the little prince sprang forward  and stood directly in front of the outstretched arm, and reaching out  his small white hand, laid it on the brown clenched fist that had been  ready to clutch him as in a vise, while a chorus of cheers at his  courage went up from outside the wall.    \"Good-day sir,\" he said in a loud voice, \"Good-day!\" As he spoke he  took hold of the great rough hand and shook it.    \"Little fool,\" roared the man, \"what do you mean, and how dare you lay  your puny paw in the claws of a lion?\"    The Dauphin smiled. \"Sir, I thought you were stretching out your hand  to reach me with it, and so I give you mine and say good-day, sir!\"    \"And if I wanted, I could crush your fingers with my fist,\" cried the  man, still holding the little hand firmly.    But from a hundred throats outside the fence came the cry \"You shall  not do it, Simon. You shall not hurt the boy!\"    \"Who can hinder me if I choose to do it?\" asked the cobbler, whose name  was Simon, with a coarse laugh. \"See, I hold the hand of the future  King of France, and I can break it if I choose, and make it so it can  never lift the sceptre of France. The little monkey thought he would  take hold of my hand and make me draw it back, but now my hand has got  hold of his, and holds it fast. And mark this, boy, the time is past  when kings seized us and trod us down, now we seize them, and do not  let them go unless we will.\"    \"But, Mr. Simon,\" said Louis, \"you see very plainly that I do not want  to do any harm, and I know you do not want to do me any harm, and I ask  you to be so good as to take away your arm, that my mamma can go on  with her walk.\"    \"But suppose I do not do as you want me to?\" asked the man defiantly.  \"I suppose then your mamma would dictate to me, and perhaps call some  soldiers and order them to shoot the dreadful people?\"    \"You know, Master Simon, that I give no such commands and never gave  such,\" said the queen quickly. \"The king and I love our people and  never would give our soldiers orders to fire on them, and now, sir--the  Queen of France and her son will no longer be detained!\" With a quick  movement she struck back the arm of the cobbler, Simon, snatched the  Dauphin away like lightning and passed by before Simon had time to put  his arm back.    The crowd watching were filled with enthusiasm by the courage of the  queen. They applauded, laughed and shouted, while the cries, \"Long live  the Queen! Long live the Dauphin!\" passed like wildfire among the  throng behind the fence, and although in the eyes of Simon whose evil  design had been frustrated by a little child, there still shone hatred,  Marie Antoinette, who was now hand in hand with the Dauphin, reached in  safety the little garden reserved for the use of the royal family. Once  within its iron gate, decorated with the arms of the kings of France,  she felt as if all power had gone from her, and she could no longer  hide her fear and grief, but, no, she must be cheerful for her son's  sake, and her servants must not see her brow clouded, and so, with head  erect and flashing eyes, she walked on.    \"Mamma,\" cried the Dauphin, interrupting her thoughts. \"There comes the  king, my father. He will be glad to hear I was so courageous.\"    The queen quickly stooped and kissed him. \"Yes, truly my little Bayard,\"  she said, \"you have done honour to your great example and been really a  little chevalier '_sans peur et sans reproche_,' but remember, Louis,  true bravery does not glory in its great deeds and does not wish  others to admire them, but keeps silent and leaves others to talk of  them!\"    \"Yes, and I will be silent too,\" cried Louis, with sparkling eyes. \"You  will see that I can be silent too,\" and child though he was, he showed  from that moment a quick understanding and appreciation of the humility  necessary to real greatness.    That winter in the Tuileries was a dismal one indeed, for the royal  family had none of the gaiety and freedom which had been part of the  happy life at Versailles, and even when the King wished to go to his  summer palace at St. Cloud for rest and change, this was not allowed.  At last, weary of the insults and restraints heaped upon them, the  royal family attempted to escape secretly from Paris, but the plot was  discovered, their carriages stopped, and they were escorted back to the  Tuileries by a shouting shrieking mob of men and women who were  fiendishly glad of their capture. After that the King and Queen and the  Dauphin were always treated as prisoners in their own palace, with  guards set over them to watch their every movement, and the poor little  Dauphin could not go out nor play freely and happily as could the  poorest peasant child in France. After some months had passed, however,  the fury of the people grew somewhat less, and they were allowed to  close the doors of their rooms when they wished, and to walk out in the  gardens once more. It even seemed for some time as if what King Louis  had done to win back the trust of his people had been successful, and  that the throne of France might regain its dignity and power before  that time when Louis the Dauphin, should come into his inheritance.    He, meanwhile, was filling this period of calm with such affairs as  interested and amused him, and his greatest joy was that he was again  allowed to work in his garden. Although it was so small in comparison  to that at Versailles, it was yet a bit of paradise to him, and as soon  as his study hours were over, he always hurried out to dig his ground,  and water and pick his blossoms, and it was the great delight of those  subjects who loved the manly little fellow, to stand outside the fence  and watch him as he worked. The Dauphin was generally accompanied, when  he went outside the palace, by several soldiers from the detachment of  the National Guard, who were on duty at the Tuileries, and the boy  himself, who was now having military drills, generally wore the uniform  of the National Guard, and so charming and so manly was this little  National Guardsman of six years, that he became the idol of Paris. Fans  and lockets were decorated with his picture, which society women wore,  and everywhere the beauty and wit of the little fellow were talked of.    The boys of Paris shared the enthusiasm of their elders, and formed  themselves into a regiment, which was called the Regiment of the  Dauphin, which, with the king's permission, marched to the Tuileries to  parade before the Dauphin. As usual, he was found in his garden, and  was anxious to show his treasures to them even before he answered their  request that he become Colonel of their regiment. When he accepted the  honour urged upon him, one of the officers said:    \"But that will mean giving up gathering flowers for your mamma.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said the Dauphin, quickly, \"that will not prevent me from  taking care of my flowers. Many of these gentlemen tell me that they,  too, have little gardens, and if they love the queen as much as their  colonel loves her, mamma will have whole regiments of bouquets every  day.\"    A cheer showed the boys' appreciation of their little colonel's  sentiment, and the regiment of the Dauphin became one of the most  popular organisations in Paris. Their uniform was a miniature copy of  the French guards, with their three-cornered hats and white jackets,  and whenever they marched through the Place de la Carousel, the people  crowded to see the army of sturdy boys with their handsome little  colonel.    So great was the boys' love for the Dauphin that the officers of the  regiment came to the palace one day to make him a present, in the name  of the whole regiment, and they were enthusiastically received by their  colonel.    \"Welcome, my comrades,\" he cried. \"My mamma tells me you have brought  me a present. But it gives me such pleasure to see you that nothing  more is needed.\"    \"But Colonel, you will not refuse our gift?\" said a little officer  named Palloy, and he added proudly:    \"We bring you a set of dominoes made entirely out of the ruins of the  Bastile.\"[1]          [1] The Bastile was the national prison, which had been entirely        destroyed by the Revolutionists.    Taking the wrapper from the white marble box, bound with gold, he gave  it to the Dauphin, at the same time reciting the following lines:        \"Those glowing walls that once woke our fear      Are changed into the toy we offer here      And when with joyful face the gift you view      Think what the people's love can do.\"    Joyfully the Dauphin received the beautiful present and listened  eagerly to the explanation of how to play the new game. On the back of  each domino, in the black marble, was a gold letter, and when the whole  set of dominoes was arranged in regular order, they formed this  sentence, Vive le Roi, Vive la Reine, et Vive le Dauphin (Long live the  King, the Queen and the Dauphin). The marble of the box was taken from  the altar-slab in the chapel of the Bastile, and in the middle, in gold  relief, was a picture of King Louis.    \"That is my papa!\" cried Louis joyfully, when he saw it.    \"Yes,\" said Palloy. \"Every one of us bears him in his heart. And like  the King, you will live for the happiness of all, and like him, you  will be the idol of France. We who shall one day be French soldiers and  citizens, bring to you, who will then be our commander-in-chief and  king, our homage as the future supporters of the throne which is  destined for you and which the wisdom of your father has placed under  the unshakable power of law. The gift which we offer you is small, but  each one of us adds his heart to it.\"    \"And I give you all of my heart in return for it,\" cried the Dauphin,  joyfully, \"and I shall take great pains to do my lessons well so I may  be allowed to amuse myself playing dominoes.\"    The delight of the Dauphin was so evident that his comrades who had  brought him the present felt a"]]]
