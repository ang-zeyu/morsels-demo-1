All these  things were obvious, and yet--and yet--might not the formal declaration  of such truths in the year of his grace 1870 be, to say the least of it,  inopportune? Might it not come as an offence, as a scandal even, to  those unacquainted with the niceties of Catholic dogma? Such were the  uneasy reflections of grave and learned ecclesiastics and theologians in  England, France, and Germany. Newman was more than usually upset;  Monseigneur Dupanloup was disgusted; and Dr. Dollinger prepared himself  for resistance. It was clear that there would be a disaffected minority  at the Council.    Catholic apologists have often argued that the Pope's claim to  infallibility implies no more than the necessary claim of every ruler,  of every government, to the right of supreme command. In England, for  instance, the Estates of the Realm exercise an absolute authority in  secular matters; no one questions this authority, no one suggests that  it is absurd or exorbitant; in other words, by general consent the  Estates of the Realm are, within their sphere, infallible. Why,  therefore, should the Pope, within his sphere--the sphere of the  Catholic Church--be denied a similar infallibility? If there is nothing  monstrous in an Act of Parliament laying down what all men shall do, why  should there be anything monstrous in a Papal Encyclical laying down  what all men shall believe? The argument is simple; in fact, it is too  simple; for it takes for granted the very question which is in dispute.  Is there indeed no radical and essential distinction between supremacy  and infallibility? Between the right of a Borough Council to regulate  the traffic and the right of the Vicar of Christ to decide upon the  qualifications for Everlasting Bliss?    There is one distinction, at any rate, which is palpable: the decisions  of a supreme authority can be altered; those of an infallible authority  cannot. A Borough Council may change its traffic regulations at the next  meeting; but the Vicar of Christ, when in certain circumstances and with  certain precautions, he has once spoken, has expressed, for all the  ages, a part of the immutable, absolute, and eternal Truth. It is this  that makes the papal pretensions so extraordinary and so enormous. It is  also this that gives them their charm. Catholic apologists, when they  try to tone down those pretensions and to explain them away, forget that  it is in their very exorbitance that their fascination lies. If the Pope  were indeed nothing more than a magnified Borough Councillor, we should  hardly have heard so much of him. It is not because he satisfies the  reason, but because he astounds it, that men abase themselves before the  Vicar of Christ.    And certainly the doctrine of Papal Infallibility presents to the reason  a sufficiency of stumbling-blocks. In the fourteenth century, for  instance, the following case arose. John XXII asserted in his bull 'Cum  inter nonnullos' that the doctrine of the poverty of Christ was  heretical. Now, according to the light of reason, one of two things must  follow from this--either John XXII was himself a heretic, or he was no  Pope. For his predecessor, Nicholas III, had asserted in his bull 'Exiit  qui seminat' that the doctrine of the poverty of Christ was the true  doctrine, the denial of which was heresy. Thus if John XXII was right,  Nicholas III was a heretic, and in that case Nicholas's nominations of  Cardinals were void, and the conclave which elected John was illegal--so  that John was no Pope, his nominations of Cardinals were void, and the  whole Papal succession vitiated. On the other hand, if John was  wrong--well, he was a heretic; and the same inconvenient results  followed. And, in either case, what becomes of Papal Infallibility?    But such crude and fundamental questions as these were not likely to  trouble the Council. The discordant minority took another line.  Infallibility they admitted readily enough, the infallibility, that is  to say, of the Church; what they shrank from was the pronouncement that  this infallibility was concentrated in the Bishop of Rome. They would  not actually deny that, as a matter of fact, it was so concentrated; but  to declare that it was, to make the belief that it was an article of  faith--what could be more--it was their favourite expression--more  inopportune? In truth, the Gallican spirit still lingered among them. At  heart, they hated the autocracy of Rome--the domination of the  centralised Italian organisation over the whole vast body of the Church.  They secretly hankered, even at this late hour, after some form of  constitutional government, and they knew that the last faint vestige of  such a dream would vanish utterly with the declaration of the  infallibility of the Pope. It did not occur to them, apparently, that a  constitutional Catholicism might be a contradiction in terms, and that  the Catholic Church, without the absolute dominion of the Pope, might  resemble the play of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.    Pius IX himself was troubled by doubts. 'Before I was Pope,' he  observed, 'I believed in Papal Infallibility, now I feel it.' As for  Manning, his certainty was no less complete than his master's. Apart  from the Holy Ghost, his appointment to the See of Westminster had been  due to Pio Nono's shrewd appreciation of the fact that he was the one  man in England upon whose fidelity the Roman Government could absolutely  rely. The voice which kept repeating 'Mettetelo li, mettetelo li' in his  Holiness's ear, whether or not it was inspired by God, was certainly  inspired by political sagacity. For now Manning was to show that he was  not unworthy of the trust which had been reposed in him. He flew to Rome  in a whirlwind of Papal enthusiasm. On the way, in Paris, he stopped for  a moment to interview those two great props of French respectability, M.  Guizot and M. Thiers. Both were careful not to commit themselves, but  both were exceedingly polite. 'I am awaiting your Council,' said M.  Guizot, 'with great anxiety. It is the last great moral power and may  restore the peace of Europe.' M. Thiers delivered a brief harangue in  favour of the principles of the Revolution, which, he declared, were the  very marrow of all Frenchmen; yet, he added, he had always supported the  Temporal Power of the Pope. 'Mais, M. Thiers,' said Manning, 'vous etes  effectivement croyant.' 'En Dieu,' replied M. Thiers.    The Rome which Manning reached towards the close of 1869 was still the  Rome which, for so many centuries, had been the proud and visible apex,  the palpitating heart, the sacred sanctuary, of the most extraordinary  mingling of spiritual and earthly powers that the world has ever known.  The Pope now, it is true, ruled over little more than the City  itself--the Patrimony of St. Peter--and he ruled there less by the Grace  of God than by the goodwill of Napoleon III; yet he was still a  sovereign Prince, and Rome was still the capital of the Papal State; she  was not yet the capital of Italy. The last hour of this strange dominion  had almost struck. As if she knew that her doom was upon her, the  Eternal City arrayed herself to meet it in all her glory.    The whole world seemed to be gathered together within her walls. Her  streets were filled with crowned heads and Princes of the Church, great  ladies and great theologians, artists and friars, diplomats and  newspaper reporters. Seven hundred bishops were there from all the  corners of Christendom, and in all the varieties of ecclesiastical  magnificence in falling lace and sweeping purple and flowing violet  veils. Zouaves stood in the colonnade of St Peter's, and Papal troops  were on the Quirinal. Cardinals passed, hatted and robed, in their  enormous carriage of state, like mysterious painted idols. Then there  was a sudden hush: the crowd grew thicker and expectation filled, the  air. Yes! it was he! He was coming! The Holy Father! But first there  appeared, mounted on a white mule and clothed in a magenta mantle, a  grave dignitary bearing aloft a silver cross. The golden coach followed,  drawn by six horses gorgeously caparisoned, and within, the smiling  white-haired Pio Nono, scattering his benedictions, while the multitude  fell upon its knees as one man. Such were the daily spectacles of  coloured pomp and of antique solemnity, which so long as the sun was  shining, at any rate--dazzled the onlooker into a happy forgetfulness of  the reverse side of the Papal dispensation--the nauseating filth of the  highways, the cattle stabled in the palaces of the great, and the fever  flitting through the ghastly tenements of the poor.    In St. Peter's, the North Transept had been screened off; rows of wooden  seats had been erected covered with Brussels carpet; and upon these  seats sat each crowned with a white mitre, the 700 Bishops in Council.  Here all day long rolled forth, in sonorous Latin, the interminable  periods of episcopal oratory; but it was not here that the issue of the  Council was determined. The assembled Fathers might talk till the  marbles of St. Peter's themselves grew weary of the reverberations; the  fate of the Church was decided in a very different manner--by little  knots of influential persons meeting quietly of a morning in the back  room of some inconspicuous lodging-house, by a sunset rendezvous in the  Borghese Gardens between a Cardinal and a Diplomatist by a whispered  conference in an alcove at a Princess's evening party, with the gay  world chattering all about. And, of course, on such momentous occasions  as these, Manning was in his element.

And if instead  of the thing itself he holds the proceeds of a sale, it is as  reasonable to make him pay over its value in trover or assumpsit  as it would have been to compel a surrender of the thing. But the  question whether the defendant has subsequently paid over the  proceeds of the sale of a chattel to a third person, cannot  affect the rights of the true owner of the [99] chattel. In the  supposed case of an auctioneer, for instance, if he had paid the  true owner, it would have been an answer to his bailor's claim.  If he has paid his bailor instead, he has paid one whom he was  not bound to pay, and no general principle requires that this  should be held to divest the plaintiff's right.    Another consideration affecting the argument that the law as to  trespasses upon property establishes a general principle, is that  the defendant's knowledge or ignorance of the plaintiff's title  is likely to lie wholly in his own breast, and therefore hardly  admits of satisfactory proof. Indeed, in many cases it cannot  have been open to evidence at all at the time when the law was  settled, before parties were permitted to testify. Accordingly,  in Basely v. Clarkson, /1/ where the defence set up to an action  of trespass quare clausum was that the defendant in mowing his  own land involuntarily and by mistake mowed down some of the  plaintiff's grass, the plaintiff had judgment on demurrer. \"For  it appears the fact was voluntary, and his intention and  knowledge are not traversable; they can't be known.\"    This language suggests that it would be sufficient to explain the  law of trespass upon property historically, without attempting to  justify it. For it seems to be admitted that if the defendant's  mistake could be proved it might be material. /2/ It will be  noticed, further, that any general argument from the law of  trespass upon laud to that governing trespass against the person  is shown to be misleading by the law as to cattle. The owner is  bound at his peril [100] to keep them off his neighbor's  premises, but he is not bound at his peril in all cases to keep  them from his neighbor's person.    The objections to such a decision as supposed in the case of an  auctioneer do not rest on the general theory of liability, but  spring altogether from the special exigencies of commerce. It  does not become unjust to hold a person liable for unauthorized  intermeddling with another's property, until there arises the  practical necessity for rapid dealing. But where this practical  necessity exists, it is not surprising to find, and we do find, a  different tendency in the law. The absolute protection of  property, however natural to a primitive community more occupied  in production than in exchange, is hardly consistent with the  requirements of modern business. Even when the rules which we  have been considering were established, the traffic of the public  markets was governed by more liberal principles. On the continent  of Europe it was long ago decided that the policy of protecting  titles must yield to the policy of protecting trade. Casaregis  held that the general principle nemo plus juris in alium  transferre potest quam ipse habet must give way in mercantile  transactions to possession vaut titre. /1/ In later times, as  markets overt have lost their importance, the Factors' Acts and  their successive amendments have tended more and more in the  direction of adopting the Continental doctrine.    I must preface the argument from precedent with a reference to  what has been said already in the first Lecture about early forms  of liability, and especially about [101] the appeals. It was  there shown that the appeals de pace et plagis and of mayhem  became the action of trespass, and that those appeals and the  early actions of trespass were always, so far as appears, for  intentional wrongs. /1/    The contra pacem in the writ of trespass was no doubt inserted to  lay a foundation for the king's writ; but there seems to be no  reason to attribute a similar purpose to vi et armis, or cum vi  sua, as it was often put. Glanvill says that wounds are within  the sheriff's jurisdiction, unless the appellor adds a charge of  breach of the king's peace. /2/ Yet the wounds are given vi et  armis as much in the one case as in the other. Bracton says that  the lesser wrongs described by him belong to the king's  jurisdiction, \"because they are sometimes against the peace of  our lord the king,\" /3/ while, as has been observed, they were  supposed to be always committed intentionally. It might even  perhaps be inferred that the allegation contra pacem was  originally material, and it will be remembered that trespasses  formerly involved the liability to pay a fine to the king. /4/    If it be true that trespass was originally confined to  intentional wrongs, it is hardly necessary to consider the  argument drawn from the scope of the general issue. In form it  was a mitigation of the strict denial de verbo in verbum of the  ancient procedure, to which the inquest given by the king's writ  was unknown. /5/ The strict form seems to have lasted in England  some time after the trial of the issue by recognition was  introduced. /6/ When [102] a recognition was granted, the inquest  was, of course, only competent to speak to the facts, as has been  said above. /1/ When the general issue was introduced, trespass  was still confined to intentional wrongs.    We may now take up the authorities. It will be remembered that  the earlier precedents are of a date when the assize and jurata  had not given place to the modern jury. These bodies spoke from  their own knowledge to an issue defined by the writ, or to  certain familiar questions of fact arising in the trial of a  cause, but did not hear the whole case upon evidence adduced.  Their function was more limited than that which has been gained  by the jury, and it naturally happened that, when they had  declared what the defendant had done, the judges laid down the  standard by which those acts were to be measured without their  assistance. Hence the question in the Year Books is not a loose  or general inquiry of the jury whether they think the alleged  trespasser was negligent on such facts as they may find, but a  well-defined issue of law, to be determined by the court, whether  certain acts set forth upon the record are a ground of liability.  It is possible that the judges may have dealt pretty strictly  with defendants, and it is quite easy to pass from the premise  that defendants have been held trespassers for a variety of acts,  without mention of neglect, to the conclusion that any act by  which another was damaged will make the actor chargeable. But a  more exact scrutiny of the early books will show that liability  in general, then as later, was [103] founded on the opinion of  the tribunal that the defendant ought to have acted otherwise,  or, in other words, that he was to blame.    Returning first to the case of the thorns in the Year Book, /1/  it will be seen that the falling of the thorns into the  plaintiff's close, although a result not wished by the defendant,  was in no other sense against his will. When he cut the thorns,  he did an act which obviously and necessarily would have that  consequence, and he must be taken to have foreseen and not to  have prevented it. Choke, C. J. says, \"As to what was said about  their falling in, ipso invito, that is no plea, but he ought to  show that he could not do it in any other way, or that he did all  in his power to keep them out\"; and both the judges put the  unlawfulness of the entry upon the plaintiff's land as a  consequence of the unlawfulness of dropping the thorns there.  Choke admits that, if the thorns or a tree had been blown over  upon the plaintiff's land, the defendant might have entered to  get them. Chief Justice Crew says of this case, in Millen v.  Fawdry, /2/ that the opinion was that \"trespass lies, because he  did not plead that he did his best endeavor to hinder their  falling there; yet this was a hard case.\" The statements of law  by counsel in argument may be left on one side, although Brian is  quoted and mistaken for one of the judges by Sir William  Blackstone, in Scott v. Shepherd.    The principal authorities are the shooting cases, and, as  shooting is an extra-hazardous act, it would not be surprising  if it should be held that men do it at their peril in public  places. The liability has been put on the general ground of  fault, however, wherever the line of necessary [104] precaution  may be drawn. In Weaver v. Ward, /1/ the defendant set up that  the plaintiff and he were skirmishing in a trainband, and that  when discharging his piece he wounded the plaintiff by accident  and misfortune, and against his own will. On demurrer, the court  says that \"no man shall be excused of a trespass,... except it  may be judged utterly without his fault. As if a man by force  take my hand and strike you, or if here the defendant had said,  that the plaintiff ran cross his piece when it was discharging,  or had set forth the case with the circumstances so as it had  appeared to the court that it had been inevitable, and that the  defendant had committed no negligence to give occasion to the  hurt.\" The later cases simply follow Weaver v. Ward.    The quotations which were made above in favor of the strict  doctrine from Sir T. Raymond, in Bessey v. Olliot, and from Sir  William Blackstone, in Scott v. Shepherd, are both taken from  dissenting opinions. In the latter case it is pretty clear that  the majority of the court considered that to repel personal  danger by instantaneously tossing away a squib thrown by another  upon one's stall was not a trespass, although a new motion was  thereby imparted to the squib, and the plaintiff's eye was put  out in consequence.
