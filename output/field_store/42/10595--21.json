Anyhow, if you lie down there, no one  would see you. I have been down there, often and often, since. When  she gets too bad to bear, I go down there and take a sleep; or lie  there and laugh, when I think how she is hunting about for me to  carry down the pails to the stream, for water.\"    \"I will say nothing about it, Jonas, you may be quite sure. That  place may save both our lives. But the other path I will tell  Josephus about. He may find it of great use.\"    Josephus was indeed greatly pleased, when he heard that a way  existed by which he could send out messages. Two or three active  men were chosen for the work; but they would not venture to descend  the steep precipice, by which Jonas made his way down to the top of  the water course, but were lowered by ropes to that point. Before  starting they were sewn up in skins so that, if a Roman sentry  caught sight of them making their way down the water course, on  their hands and feet, he would take them for dogs, or some other  animals. Once at the bottom, they lay still till night, and then  crawled through the line of sentries.    In this way Josephus was able to send out dispatches to his friends  outside, and to Jerusalem; imploring them to send an army, at once,  to harass the rear of the Romans, and to afford an opportunity for  the garrison of Jotapata to cut their way out. Messages came back  by return and, for three weeks, communications were thus kept up;  until one of the messengers slipped while descending the ravine  and, as he rolled down, attracted the attention of the Romans who,  after that, placed a strong guard at the foot of the water course.    Until this discovery was made, Jonas had gone down regularly, every  morning, and drank his fill; and had brought up a small skin of  water to John, who had divided it among the children whom he saw  most in want of it--for the pressure of thirst was now heavy. The  Romans, from rising ground at a distance, had noticed the women  going daily with jugs to the cistern, whence the water was doled  out; and the besiegers directed their missiles to that point, and  many were killed, daily, while fetching water.    A dull despair now seized the Jews. So long as they were fighting,  they had had little time to think of their situation; but now that  the enemy no longer attacked, and there was nothing to do but to  sit down and suffer, the hopelessness of their position stared them  in the face. But there was no thought of surrender. They knew too  well the fate that awaited them, at the hands of the Romans.    They were therefore seized with rage, and indignation, when they  heard that Josephus and some of the principal men were thinking of  making an endeavor to escape. John, who had hitherto regarded his  leader with a passionate devotion--although he thought that he had  been wrong in taking to the fortified towns, instead of fighting  among the mountains--shared in the general indignation at the  proposed desertion.    \"It is he who has brought us all here,\" he said to Jonas--who had  attached himself to him with dog-like fidelity--\"and now he  proposes to go away, and leave everyone here to be massacred! I  cannot believe it.\"    The news was, however, well founded for, when the inhabitants  crowded down to the house--the women weeping and wailing, the men  sullen and fierce--to beg Josephus to abandon his intention, the  governor attempted to argue that it was for the public good that he  should leave them. He might, he said, hurry to Jerusalem, and bring  an army to the rescue. The people, however, were in no way  convinced.    \"If you go,\" they said, \"the Romans will speedily capture the city.  We are ready to die, all together--to share one common fate--but do  not leave us.\"    As Josephus saw that, if he did not accede to the prayers of the  women, the men would interfere by force to prevent his carrying out  his intentions, he told them he would remain with them; and  tranquillity was at once restored. The men, however, came again and  again to him, asking to be led out to attack the Romans.    \"Let us die fighting,\" was the cry. \"Let us die among our foes, and  not with the agonies of thirst.\"    \"We must make them come up to attack us, again,\" Josephus said. \"We  shall fight to far greater advantage, so, than if we sallied out to  attack them in their own intrenchments--when we should be shot down  by their archers and slingers, before ever we should reach them.\"    \"But how are we to make them attack us? We want nothing better.\"    \"I will think it over,\" Josephus said, \"and tell you in the  morning.\"    In the morning, to the surprise of the men, they were ordered to  dip large numbers of garments into the precious supply of water,  and to hang them on the walls. Loud were the outcries of the women,  as they saw the scanty store of water, upon which their lives  depended, so wasted; but the orders were obeyed, and the Romans  were astonished at seeing the long line of dripping garments on the  wall.    The stratagem had its effect. Vespasian thought that the news he  had received, that the place was ill supplied with water, must be  erroneous; and ordered the troops again to take their station on  the walls, and renew the attack. Great was the exultation among the  Jews, when they saw the movement among the troops; and Josephus,  ordering the fighting men together, said that now was their  opportunity. There was no hope of safety, in passive resistance;  therefore they had best sally out and, if they must die, leave at  least a glorious example to posterity.    The proposal was joyfully received, and he placed himself at their  head. The gates were suddenly opened, and they poured out to the  attack. So furious was their onslaught that the Romans were driven  from the embankment. The Jews pursued them, crossed the lines of  circumvallation, and attacked the Romans in their camp; tearing up  the hides and penthouses behind which the Romans defended  themselves, and setting fire to the lines in many places.    The fight raged all day. The Jews then retired to the city, only to  sally out again, the following morning. For three days the attacks  were continued; the Jews driving in the Romans, each day, and  retiring when Vespasian brought up heavy columns--who were unable,  from the weight of their armor, to follow their lightly-armed  assailants. Vespasian then ordered the regular troops to remain in  camp, the assaults being repelled by the archers and slingers.    Finding that the courage of the Jews was unabated, and that his  troops were losing heavily in this irregular fighting, he  determined to renew the siege, at all hazards, and bring the matter  to a close. The heavy-armed troops were ordered to be in readiness,  and to advance against the walls with the battering ram. This was  pushed forward by a great number of men; being covered, as it  advanced, with a great shield constructed of wattles and hides. As  it was brought forward, the archers and slingers covered its  advance by a shower of missiles against the defenders of the wall;  while all the war machines poured in their terrible shower.    The Jews, unable to show themselves above the battlements, or to  oppose the advance of the terrible machine, crouched in shelter  until the battering ram was placed in position.    Then the ropes by which it swung from the framework overhead were  seized, by a number of soldiers, and the first blow was delivered  at the wall. It quivered beneath the terrible shock, and a cry of  dismay arose from the defenders. Again and again the heavy ram  struck, in the same place. The wall tottered beneath the blows; and  would soon have fallen, had not Josephus ordered a number of sacks  to be filled with straw, and let down by ropes from the walls, so  as to deaden the blows of the ram.    For a time the Romans ceased work; and then, fastening scythes to  the ends of long poles, cut the ropes. The Jews were unable to show  themselves above the walls, or to interfere with the men at work.  In a few minutes the sacks were cut down, and the ram recommenced  its work of destruction.        Chapter 6: The Fall Of The City.      The Roman soldiers--seeing the wall of Jotapata tremble beneath the  blows of the battering ram, whose iron head pounded to powder the  stones against which it struck--redoubled their efforts when,  suddenly, from three sally ports which they had prepared, the Jews  burst out; carrying their weapons in their right hands, and blazing  torches in their left. As on previous occasions, their onslaught  was irresistible. They swept the Romans before them; and set fire  to the engines, the wattles, and the palisades, and even to the  woodwork of the embankment. The timber had by this time dried and,  as bitumen and pitch had been used as cement in the construction of  the works, the flames spread with great rapidity; and the work of  many days was destroyed, in an hour. All the engines and  breastworks of the Fifth and Tenth Legions were entirely consumed.    Just as the attack began, Eleazar--the son of Sameas, a  Galilean--with an immense stone from the wall, struck the iron head  of the battering ram, and knocked it off. He then leaped down from  the wall, seized the iron head, and carried it back into the city.  He was pierced by five arrows. Still, he pressed on and regained  the walls; and held up the iron head in the sight of all, and then  fell down dead.    Such was the spirit with which the Jews were animated; and the  Roman soldiers, trained as they were to conflict among many  peoples, were yet astounded by the valor displayed by the race that  they had considered as unwarlike peasants. But the Romans were not  discouraged. Heavy masses of troops were brought up, the Jews were  driven within their walls and, towards evening, the ram was again  in position.    While Vespasian was directing the attack, he was struck by a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21615"],[0,"Curiosities of Literature, Vol. 1 (#17)"],[1,"ce; and sent the dying poet a  sum of money.    Dryden, for less than three hundred pounds, sold Tonson ten thousand  verses, as may be seen by the agreement.    Purchas, who in the reign of our first James, had spent his life in  compiling his _Relation of the World_, when he gave it to the public,  for the reward of his labours was thrown into prison, at the suit of his  printer. Yet this was the book which, he informs Charles I. in his  dedication, his father read every night with great profit and  satisfaction.    The Marquis of Worcester, in a petition to parliament, in the reign of  Charles II., offered to publish the hundred processes and machines,  enumerated in his very curious \"Centenary of Inventions,\" on condition  that money should be granted to extricate him from the _difficulties in  which he had involved himself by the prosecution of useful discoveries_.  The petition does not appear to have been attended to! Many of these  admirable inventions were lost. The _steam-engine_ and the _telegraph_,  may be traced among them.    It appears by the Harleian MS. 7524, that Rushworth, the author of the  \"Historical Collections,\" passed the last years of his life in gaol,  where indeed he died. After the Restoration, when he presented to the  king several of the privy council's books, which he had preserved from  ruin, he received for his only reward the _thanks of his majesty_.    Rymer, the collector of the Foedera, must have been sadly reduced, by  the following letter, I found addressed by Peter le Neve, Norroy, to the  Earl of Oxford.    \"I am desired by Mr. Rymer, historiographer, to lay before your lordship  the circumstances of his affairs. He was forced some years back to part  with all his choice printed books to subsist himself: and now, he says,  he must be forced, for subsistence, to sell all his MS. collections to  the best bidder, without your lordship will be pleased to buy them for  the queen's library. They are fifty volumes in folio, of public affairs,  which he hath collected, but not printed. The price he asks is five  hundred pounds.\"    Simon Ockley, a learned student in Oriental literature, addresses a  letter to the same earl, in which he paints his distresses in glowing  colours. After having devoted his life to Asiatic researches, then very  uncommon, he had the mortification of dating his preface to his great  work from Cambridge Castle, where he was confined for debt; and, with an  air of triumph, feels a martyr's enthusiasm in the cause for which he  perishes.    He published his first volume of the History of the Saracens in 1708;  and, ardently pursuing his oriental studies, published his second, ten  years afterwards, without any patronage. Alluding to the encouragement  necessary to bestow on youth, to remove the obstacles to such studies,  he observes, that \"young men will hardly come in on the prospect of  finding leisure, in a prison, to transcribe those papers for the press,  which they have collected with indefatigable labour, and oftentimes at  the expense of their rest, and all the other conveniences of life, for  the service of the public. No! though I were to assure them, from my own  experience, that _I have enjoyed more true liberty, more happy leisure,  and more solid repose, in six months_ HERE, than in thrice the same  number of years before. _Evil is the condition of that historian who  undertakes to write the lives of others, before he knows how to live  himself._--Not that I speak thus as if I thought I had any just cause to  be angry with the world--I did always in my judgment give the  possession of _wisdom_ the preference to that of _riches_!\"    Spenser, the child of Fancy, languished out his life in misery, \"Lord  Burleigh,\" says Granger, \"who it is said prevented the queen giving him  a hundred pounds, seems to have thought the lowest clerk in his office a  more deserving person.\" Mr. Malone attempts to show that Spenser had a  small pension, but the poet's querulous verses must not be forgotten--        \"Full little knowest thou, that hast not try'd,      What Hell it is, in suing long to bide.\"    To lose good days--to waste long nights--and, as he feelingly exclaims,        \"To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run,      To speed, to give, to want, to be undone!\"    How affecting is the death of Sydenham, who had devoted his life to a  laborious version of Plato! He died in a sponging-house, and it was his  death which appears to have given rise to the Literary Fund \"for the  relief of distressed authors.\"[19]    Who will pursue important labours when they read these anecdotes? Dr.  Edmund Castell spent a great part of his life in compiling his _Lexicon  Heptaglotton_, on which he bestowed incredible pains, and expended on it  no less than 12,000_l._, broke his constitution, and exhausted his  fortune. At length it was printed, but the copies remained _unsold_ on  his hands. He exhibits a curious picture of literary labour in his  preface. \"As for myself, I have been unceasingly occupied for such a  number of years in this mass,\" _Molendino_ he calls them, \"that that  day seemed, as it were, a holiday in which I have not laboured so much  as sixteen or eighteen hours in these enlarging lexicons and Polyglot  Bibles.\"    Le Sage resided in a little cottage while he supplied the world with  their most agreeable novels, and appears to have derived the sources of  his existence in his old age from the filial exertions of an excellent  son, who was an actor of some genius. I wish, however, that every man of  letters could apply to himself the epitaph of this delightful writer:--    _\"Sous ce tombeau git LE SAGE, abattu Par le ciseau de la Parque  importune; S'il ne fut pas ami de la fortune, Il fut toujours ami de la  vertu.\"_    Many years after this article had been written, I published \"Calamities  of Authors,\" confining myself to those of our own country; the catalogue  is incomplete, but far too numerous.      FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 18: For some time previous to his death he was in so abject a  state of poverty as to be dependent for subsistence upon the exertions  of his faithful servant Antonio, a native of Java, whom he had brought  with him from India, and who was accustomed to beg by night for the  bread which was to save his unhappy master from perishing by want the  next day. Camoeens, when death at last put an end to a life which  misfortune and neglect had rendered insupportable, was denied the solace  of having his faithful Antonio to close his eyes. He was aged only  fifty-five when he breathed his last in the hospital. This event  occurred in 1579, but so little regard was paid to the memory of this  great man that the day or month on which he expired remains  unknown.--Adamson's _Memoirs of Camoeens_, 1820.]    [Footnote 19: This melancholy event happened in 1788, fifteen years  after the original projector of the Literary Fund, Mr. David Williams,  had endeavoured to establish it. It appears that Mr. Floyer Sydenham was  arrested \"for a small debt; he never spoke after being arrested, and  sunk under the pressure of his calamity.\" This is the published record  of the event by the officers of the present fund; and these simple words  are sufficiently indicative of the harrowing nature of the catastrophe;  it was strongly felt that Mr. Williams' hopeful plan of preventing a  second act so fatal should be encouraged. A small literary club took the  initiative, and subscribed a few guineas to pay for such advertisements  as were necessary to keep the intended objects of the founder before the  public, and solicit its aid. Two years afterwards a committee was  formed; another two years saw it take position among the established  institutions of the country. In 1818 it obtained a royal charter. In its  career it has relieved upwards of 1300 applicants, and devoted to that  purpose 47,725_l._]          IMPRISONMENT OF THE LEARNED.      Imprisonment has not always disturbed the man of letters in the progress  of his studies, but has unquestionably greatly promoted them.    In prison Boethius composed his work on the Consolations of Philosophy;  and Grotius wrote his Commentary on Saint Matthew, with other works: the  detail of his allotment of time to different studies, during his  confinement, is very instructive.    Buchanan, in the dungeon of a monastery in Portugal, composed his  excellent Paraphrases of the Psalms of David.    Cervantes composed the most agreeable book in the Spanish language  during his captivity in Barbary.    Fleta, a well-known law production, was written by a person confined in  the Fleet for debt; the name of the _place_, though not that of the  _author_, has thus been preserved; and another work, \"Fleta Minor, or  the Laws of Art and Nature in, knowing the bodies of Metals, &c. by Sir  John Pettus, 1683;\" received its title from the circumstance of his  having translated it from the German during his confinement in this  prison.    Louis the Twelfth, when Duke of Orleans, was long imprisoned in the  Tower of Bourges: applying himself to his studies, which he had  hitherto neglected, he became, in consequence, an enlightened monarch.    Margaret, queen of Henry the Fourth, King of France, confined in the  Louvre, pursued very warmly the studies of elegant literature, and  composed a very skilful apology for the irregularities of her conduct.    Sir Walter Raleigh's unfinished History of the World, which leaves us to  regret that later ages had not been celebrated by his eloquence, was the  fruits of eleven years of imprisonment. It was written for the use of  Prince Henry, as he and Dallington, who also wrote \"Aphorisms\" for the  same prince, have told us; the prince looked over the manuscript. Of  Raleigh it is observed, to employ the language of Hume, \"They were  struck with the extensive genius of the man, who, being educated amidst  naval and military enterprises, had surpassed, in the pursuits of"]]]
