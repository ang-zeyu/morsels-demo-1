Of all the 'organic' colloids cellulose is the only  one which can be converted into a variety of derivative forms, from each  of which a regular solid can be produced in continuous length and of any  prescribed dimensions. Thus we can compare the structural properties of  cellulose with those of its hydrates, nitrates, acetates, and benzoates,  in terms of measurements of breaking strain, extensibility, elasticity.  Investigations in this field are being prosecuted, but the results are  not as yet sufficiently elaborated for reduction to formulae. One  striking general conclusion is, however, established, and that is that  the structural properties of cellulose are but little affected by  esterification and appear therefore to be a function of the special  arrangement of the carbon atoms, i.e. of the molecular constitution.  Also it is established that the molecular aggregate which constitutes a  cellulose is of a resistant type, and undoubtedly persists in the  solutions of the compounds.    It may be urged that it is superfluous to import these questions of  mass-aggregation into the problem of the chemical constitution of  cellulose. But we shall find that the point again arises in attempting  to define the reacting unit, which is another term for the molecule. In  the majority of cases we rely for this upon physical measurements; and  in fact the purely chemical determination of such quantities is  inferential. Attempts have been made to determine the molecular weights  of the cellulose esters in solution, by observations of depression of  solidifying and boiling-points. But the numbers have little value. The  only other well-defined compound is the sulphocarbonate. It has been  pointed out that, by successive precipitations of this compound, there  occurs a continual aggregation of the cellulose with dissociation of the  alkali and CS residues and it has been found impossible to assign a  limit to the dissociation, i.e. to fix a point at which the transition  from soluble sulphocarbonate to insoluble cellulose takes place.    On these grounds it will be seen we are reduced to a somewhat  speculative treatment of the hypothetical ultimate unit group, which is  taken as of C_{6} dimensions.    As there has been no addition of experimental facts directly  contributing to the solution of the problem, the material available for  a discussion of the probabilities remains very much as stated in the  first edition, pp. 75-77. It is now generally admitted that the  tetracetate _n_ [C_{6}H_{6}O.(OAc)_{4}] is a normal cellulose ester;  therefore that four of the five O atoms are hydroxylic. The fifth is  undoubtedly carbonyl oxygen. The reactions of cellulose certainly  indicate that the CO- group is ketonic rather than aldehydic. Even when  attacked by strong sulphuric acid the resolution proceeds some  considerable way before products are obtained reducing Fehling's  solution. This is not easily reconcilable with any polyaldose formula.  Nor is the resistance of cellulose to very severe alkaline treatments.  The probability may be noted here that under the action of the alkaline  hydrates there occurs a change of configuration. Lobry de Bruyn's  researches on the change of position of the typical CO- group of the  simple hexoses, in presence of alkalis, point very definitely in this  direction. It is probable that in the formation of alkali cellulose  there is a constitutional change of the cellulose, which may in effect  be due to a migration of a CO- position within the unit group. Again  also we have the interesting fact that structural changes accompany the  chemical reaction. It is surprising that there should have been no  investigation of these changes of external form and structure, otherwise  than as mass effects. We cannot, therefore, say what may be the  molecular interpretation of these effects. It has not yet been  determined whether there are any intrinsic volume changes in the  cellulose substance itself: and as regards what changes are determined  in the reacting unit or molecule, we can only note a fruitful subject  for future investigation. _A priori_ our views of the probable changes  depend upon the assumed constitution of the unit group. If of the  ordinary carbohydrate type, formulated with an open chain, there is  little to surmise beyond the change of position of a CO- group. But  alternative formulae have been proposed. Thus the tetracetate is a  derivative to be reckoned with in the problem. It is formed under  conditions which preclude constitutional changes within the unit groups.  The temperature of the main reaction is 30 deg.-40 deg., the reagents are used  but little in excess of the quantitative proportions, and the yields are  approximately quantitative. If now the derivative is formed entirely  without the hydrolysis the empirical formula C_{6}H_{6}O.(OAc)_{4}  justifies a closed-ring formula for the original viz.  CO<[CHOH]_{4}>CH_{2}; and the preference for this formula depends upon  the explanation it affords of the aggregation of the groups by way of  CO-CH_{2} synthesis.    The exact relationship of the tetracetate to the original cellulose is  somewhat difficult to determine. The starting-point is a cellulose  hydrate, since it is the product obtained by decomposition of the  sulphocarbonate. The degree of _hydrolysis_ attending the cycle of  reactions is indicated by the formula 4 C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}.H_{2}O. It has  been already shown that this degree of hydrolysis does not produce  molecular disaggregation. If this hydrate survived the acetylation it  would of course affect the empirical composition, i.e. chiefly the  carbon percentage, of the product. It may be here pointed out that the  extreme variation of the carbon in this group of carbohydrate esters is  as between C_{14}H_{20}O_{10} (C = 48.3 p.ct.) and C_{14}H_{18}O_{9} (C  = 50.8 p.ct.) i.e. a tetracetate of C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} and  C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} respectively. In the fractional intermediate terms it  is clear that we come within the range of ordinary experimental errors,  and to solve this critical point by way of ultimate analysis must  involve an extended series of analyses with precautions for specially  minimising and quantifying the error. The determination of the acetyl by  saponification is also subject to an error sufficiently large to  preclude the results being applied to solve the point. While, therefore,  we must defer the final statement as to whether the tetracetate is  produced from or contains a partly hydrolysed cellulose molecule, it is  clear that at least a large proportion of the unit groups must be  acetylated in the proportion C_{6}H_{6}O.(OAc)_{4}.    It has been shown that by the method of Franchimont a higher proportion  of acetyl groups can be introduced; but this result involves a  destructive hydrolysis of the cellulose: the acetates are not  derivatives of cellulose, but of products of hydrolytic decomposition.    It appears, therefore, that with the normal limit of acetylation at the  tetracetate the aggregation of the unit groups must depend upon the CO-  groups and a ring formula of the general form CO<[CHOH]_{4}>CH_{2} is  consistent with the facts.    Vignon has proposed for cellulose the constitutional formula         O------CH       |      | \\       |      O  \\[CHOH]_{3}       |      |  /       CH_{2}-CH/    with reference to the highest nitrate, and the decomposition of the  nitrate by alkalis with formation of hydroxypyruvic acid. While these  reactions afford no very sure ground for deductions as to constitutional  relationships, it certainly appears that, if the aldose view of the unit  group is to be retained, this form of the anhydride contains suggestions  of the general tendency of the celluloses on treatment with condensing  acids to split off formic acid in relatively large quantity [Ber. 1895,  1940]; the condensation of the oxycelluloses to furfural; the  non-formation of the normal hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids by nitric acid  oxidations. Indirectly we may point out that any hypothesis which  retains the polyaldose view of cellulose, and so fails to differentiate  its constitution from that of starch, has little promise of progress.  The above formula, moreover, concerns the assumed unit group, with no  suggestion as to the mode of aggregation in the cellulose complex. Also  there is no suggestion as to how far the formula is applicable to the  celluloses considered as a group. In extending this view to the  oxycelluloses, Vignon introduces the derived oxidised group         CHO.(CHOH)_{3}.CH . CO                      |_O__|    --of which one is apportioned to three or four groups of the cellulose  previously formulated: these groups in condensed union together  constitute an oxycellulose.    These views are in agreement with the experimental results obtained by  Faber and Tollens (p. 71). They regard the oxycelluloses as compounds of  'celloxin' C_{6}H_8{O}_{6} with 1-4 mols. unaltered cellulose; and the  former they particularly refer to as a lactone of glycuronic acid. But  on boiling with lime they obtain dioxybutyric and isosaccharinic acids;  both of which are not very obviously related to the compounds formulated  by Vignon. We revert with preference to a definitely ketonic formula,  for which, moreover, some farther grounds remain to be mentioned. In the  systematic investigation of the nitric esters of the carbohydrates (p.  41) Will and Lenze have definitely differentiated the ketoses from the  aldoses, as showing an internal condensation accompanying the ester  reaction. Not only are the OH groups taking part in the latter  consequently less by two than in the corresponding aldoses, but the  nitrates show a much increased stability. This would give a simple  explanation of the well-known facts obtaining in the corresponding  esters of the normal cellulose.
