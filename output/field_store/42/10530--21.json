It serves to indicate the shore of the           sea, while on the other side this is effected by the high rocks           upon which the pirate (X¹ b) is seated.             The next group on the left is represented as at the very edge           of the water, and consists of a nude bearded satyr (X b), who           is dragging an overthrown pirate (X a) by the foot, with the           evident intention of hurling him into the sea. The legs and the           right arm of this pirate have been destroyed by another hole,           similar to that which is found between figures IX and IX a. On  Page 52  the right side, a bearded satyr, with flowing panther-skin           (x¹ a) rushes to the right, thrusting a torch into the face           of a pirate who is seated on a rock (x¹ b), with his hands           bound behind his back. In his shoulder are fastened the fangs           of a serpent, which is in keeping here as sacred to Dionysos.           Perhaps, as Stuart has suggested,[106] he may be a           metamorphosis of the cord with which the pirate's hands are           bound; but the sculptor has not made this clear. The figures of           this group, which were in tolerable preservation at the time           when Lord Elgin's cast was made, have since been nearly           effaced, particularly the face, legs and torch of the satyr,           and the face and legs of the pirate, also the rocks upon which           he is seated, and the serpent. Between these figures and the           following dolphin, there is a third hole, similar to those           mentioned already, and measuring 15x16 centimetres.             [Footnote 106: I, p. 34. Stuart cites Nonnus, _Dionys._ XLV.           137. _Cf._ also _Ancient Marbles in the British Mus._ IX. p.           115.]             The less rigid correspondence of these groups (x, ix: ix¹,           x¹), as caused some difficulty. In the text of the _British           Museum Marbles_[107], all that falls between the pair of           dolphins (VII: VIII¹), is regarded as belonging to a           separate composition, grouped about the single dolphin (0¹).           But such an interpolated composition, besides having no purpose           in itself, would vitiate the unity of the entire relief. For,           although the circular form is less favorable to a strongly           marked symmetry than is the plane, at least in compositions of           small extent, still the individual figures and groups must bear           some relation to a common centre, and there can be no division           of interest, or mere stringing together of disconnected figures           or groups of figures. Such a stringing together is assumed by           Mr. Murray, when, in his _History of Greek Sculpture_,[108] he           speaks of seven figures after the pair of dolphins, which,           \"though without direct responsion among themselves, still           indicate the continued punishment of the pirates.\" In the           pirate seated on the rocks (x b), however, Mr. Murray[109]           finds what he calls a \"sort of echo\" of Dionysos, inasmuch as           he is seated in a commanding position, and is attacked by the           god's serpent. There is, to be sure, a certain external           resemblance in the attitudes of the two figures, but direct  Page 53  connection cannot be assumed without separating x¹ a from           x¹ b, with which, however, it obviously forms a group, and           entirely disregarding the relations which the groups x, ix:           ix¹, x¹ bear to one another and to the dolphin 0¹. And           this Mr. Murray does, when he takes seven figures, among which           x¹ b is evidently to be considered as central instead of what           is plainly four groups of two figures each, _plus_ one dolphin.             [Footnote 107: IX, p. 115.]             [Footnote 108: II, p. 333.]             [Footnote 109: II, p. 332.]             There is, as we have already said, a general correspondence           between these groups. This is effected, in such a way that the           group ix resembles x¹ in action and arrangement, rather than           9¹, which, on the other hand, resembles group x, rather than           group ix. In other words, the diagonalism which we have noticed           above in the arrangement of young and old satyrs (vi a, v b,           iv: iv¹, v¹ b, vi¹ a), is extended here to the groups           themselves.             Moreover, the stretches of sea with the paired dolphins (viii:           viii¹), which are introduced between these groups and those           which had preceded, are not to be regarded as separating the           composition into two parts, but as connecting the central scene           with similar scenes in a different locality. These scenes are           again joined by another stretch of sea with the single dolphin           (0¹), which thus forms the centre of the back of the relief,           opposite Dionysos, and the terminus of the action which           proceeds from the god toward either side.             I do not mean to say, however, that these scenes beyond the           dolphins (viii: viii¹), are to be looked upon as a mere           repetition of those which have preceded, distinguished only by           greater license in the symmetry, or that the changes of           locality have no other purpose than to lend variety to the           action. On the contrary, if we examine the indications of           scenery in this relief, we see that those features by which the           artist has characterized the place of this part of the action           as the seashore, the trees near the water's edge, the           alternating stretches of land and sea, the dolphins, the satyr           pulling the pirate into the water (x), are confined to the           space beyond the trees. In the scenes on the other side of the           trees, there is not only no suggestion of the sea, but the           rocks and the sequence of figures up to Dionysos indicate           rather that his place of repose is some elevation near the           seashore. The contrast between the more peaceful and luxurious           surroundings of the god and the violent contest with the  Page 54  pirates, is thus carried out and enforced by the sculptural           indications of landscape, as well as by the leading lines of           the composition. Though I would not imply that the composition           of this frieze was in any way governed by the laws which rule           similar compositions in pediments, it is interesting and           instructive to note that the general principles of distribution           of subject which have been followed, are somewhat similar to           those which we can trace in the best-known pediments extant;           thus, as the god in his more elevated position would occupy the           centre of the pediment, so the low-lying seashore and the           scenes which are being enacted upon it correspond to the wings           at either side.             To recapitulate, the concordance of figures in this relief is           then briefly as follows: In the central scene, _i.e._, inside           the vases, and in the first pair of transitional figures (III,           II, I: I¹), (II¹, III¹), equality of persons, but not of           accessories (drapery, thyrsi); action symmetrical. In the           immediately adjacent scenes, including the second pair of           transitional figures and the satyrs at the trees (VII, VI, V,           IV: IV¹, V¹, VI¹, VII¹), the persons are diagonally           symmetrical in VIa, Vb, IV: IV¹, V¹b, VI¹a (_i.e._,           old, young, old: young, old, young), equal in VII: VII¹. The           drapery is diagonally symmetrical in Vb, IV: IV¹, V¹b           (_i.e._, panther-skin, nudity: panther-skin, nudity), equal in           VIa: VI¹a, not symmetrical in VII: VII¹, and the weapons           are not symmetrical, except in VII: VII¹ (_i.e._, thyrsus,           club, torch: club, no weapon, club). The action is symmetrical           throughout, although not exactly the same in V: V¹. In the           scenes beyond the dolphins, the persons are equivalent (X, IX:           IX¹, X¹), while the action, drapery and weapons are           harmonious, but not diagonally symmetrical (_i.e._, IXa =           X¹a, but Xb IX¹a). At the left, a tree, at the right, a           pile of rocks and a serpent.--The persons are, accordingly,           symmetrical throughout; the action is so until past the           dolphins (VIII: VIII¹); the drapery only in II: II¹, and           in VI, V, IV: IV¹, V¹, VI¹; and the weapons not at all.             It is thus apparent that the correspondence of the figures in           this frieze is by no means rigid and schematic or devoid of           life, but that, on the contrary, the same principles of           symmetry obtain which have been pointed out by many authorities           as prevalent in Greek art.[110] The whole composition exhibits  Page 55  freedom and elasticity, not so indulged in as to produce           discord, but peculiarly appropriate to the element of mirth and           comedy which characterizes the story, and upon which the           sculptor has laid especial stress.

Rich in natural resources,  Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products, minerals,  metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for 57% of the value of  total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can have a  big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased  exports of manufactured goods, but competition in international  markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low  growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD countries in the  early 1990s, but the economy has expanded at reasonably steady rates  in recent years. In addition to high unemployment, short-term economic  problems include a balancing of output growth and inflationary  pressures and the stimulation of exports to offset rising imports,  especially given the economic crisis in Asia.
