I come for the sake of the Princess Eileen. Of course,  you forgot all about her, and, of course, she is always thinking of you.  It's always the way--      \"'Favored lovers may forget,     Slighted lovers never yet.'\"      The prince blushed with shame when he heard the name of the princess.    \"'Tis you that ought to blush,\" said the cat; \"but listen to me now, and  remember, if you don't obey my directions this time you'll never see me  again, and you'll never set your eyes on the Princess Eileen. When the  old giantess comes back tell her you wish, when the morning comes, to go  down to the sea to look at it for the last time. When you reach the sea  you will know what to do. But I must go now, as I hear the giantess  coming.\" And the cat jumped out of the window and disappeared.    \"Well,\" said the giantess, when she came in, \"is there anything you  wish?\"    \"Is it true I must die to-morrow?\" asked the prince.    \"It is.\"    \"Then,\" said he, \"I should like to go down to the sea to look at it for  the last time.\"    \"You may do that,\" said the giantess, \"if you get up early.\"    \"I'll be up with the lark in the light of the morning,\" said the prince.    \"Very well,\" said the giantess, and, saying \"good night,\" she went away.    The prince thought the night would never pass, but at last it faded  away before the gray light of the dawn, and he sped down to the sea. He  threw out the third ball, and before long he saw the little boat coming  towards him swifter than the wind. He threw himself into it the moment  it touched the shore. Swifter than the wind it bore him out to sea, and  before he had time to look behind him the island of the giantess was  like a faint red speck in the distance. The day passed and the night  fell, and the stars looked down, and the boat sailed on, and just as the  sun rose above the sea it pushed its silver prow on the golden strand of  an island greener than the leaves in summer. The prince jumped out, and  went on and on until he entered a pleasant valley, at the head of which  he saw a palace white as snow.    As he approached the central door it opened for him. On entering the hall  he passed into several rooms without meeting with anyone; but, when he  reached the principal apartment, he found himself in a circular room, in  which were a thousand pillars, and every pillar was of marble, and on  every pillar save one, which stood in the centre of the room, was a  little white cat with black eyes. Ranged round the wall, from one  door-jamb to the other, were three rows of precious jewels. The first  was a row of brooches of gold and silver, with their pins fixed in the  wall and their heads outwards; the second a row of torques of gold and  silver; and the third a row of great swords, with hilts of gold and  silver. And on many tables was food of all kinds, and drinking horns  filled with foaming ale.[11]    While the prince was looking about him the cats kept on jumping from  pillar to pillar; but seeing that none of them jumped on to the pillar  in the centre of the room, he began to wonder why this was so, when, all  of a sudden, and before he could guess how it came about, there right  before him on the center pillar was the little white cat.    \"Don't you know me?\" said he.    \"I do,\" said the prince.    \"Ah, but you don't know who I am. This is the palace of the Little White  Cat, and I am the King of the Cats. But you must be hungry, and the  feast is spread.\"    Well, when the feast was ended, the King of the Cats called for the  sword that would kill the giant Trencoss, and the hundred cakes for the  hundred watch-dogs.    The cats brought the sword and the cakes and laid them before the king.    \"Now,\" said the king, \"take these; you have no time to lose. To-morrow  the dwarfs will wind the last ball, and to-morrow the giant will claim  the princess for his bride. So you should go at once; but before you go  take this from me to your little girl.\"    And the king gave him a brooch lovelier than any on the palace walls.    The king and the prince, followed by the cats, went down to the strand,  and when the prince stepped into the boat all the cats \"mewed\" three  times for good luck, and the prince waved his hat three times, and the  little boat sped over the waters all through the night as brightly and  as swiftly as a shooting star. In the first flush of the morning it  touched the strand. The prince jumped out and went on and on, up hill  and down dale, until he came to the giant's castle. When the hounds  saw him they barked furiously, and bounded towards him to tear him to  pieces. The prince flung the cakes to them, and as each hound swallowed  his cake he fell dead. The prince then struck his shield three times  with the sword which he had brought from the palace of the little white  cat.    When the giant heard the sound he cried out:    \"Who comes to challenge me on my wedding-day?\"    The dwarfs went out to see, and, returning, told him it was a prince who  challenged him to battle.    The giant, foaming with rage, seized his heaviest iron club, and rushed  out to the fight. The fight lasted the whole day, and when the sun went  down the giant said:    \"We have had enough of fighting for the day. We can begin at sunrise  to-morrow.\"    \"Not so,\" said the prince. \"Now or never; win or die.\"    \"Then take this,\" cried the giant, as he aimed a blow with all his force  at the prince's head; but the prince, darting forward like a flash of  lightning, drove his sword into the giant's heart, and, with a groan,  he fell over the bodies of the poisoned hounds.    When the dwarfs saw the giant dead they began to cry and tear their  hair. But the prince told them they had nothing to fear, and he bade  them go and tell the Princess Eileen he wished to speak with her. But  the princess had watched the battle from her window, and when she saw  the giant fall she rushed out to greet the prince, and that very night  he and she and all the dwarfs and harpers set out for the Palace of the  Silver River, which they reached the next morning, and from that day to  this there never has been a gayer wedding than the wedding of the Prince  of the Silver River and the Princess Eileen; and though she had diamonds  and pearls to spare, the only jewel she wore on her wedding-day was the  brooch which the prince had brought her from the Palace of the Little  White Cat in the far-off seas.          PRINCESS FINOLA AND THE DWARF      A long, long time ago there lived in a little hut in the midst of a  bare, brown, lonely moor an old woman and a young girl. The old woman  was withered, sour-tempered, and dumb. The young girl was as sweet and  as fresh as an opening rosebud, and her voice was as musical as the  whisper of a stream in the woods in the hot days of summer. The little  hut, made of branches woven closely together, was shaped like a beehive.  In the center of the hut a fire burned night and day from year's end to  year's end, though it was never touched or tended by human hand. In the  cold days and nights of winter it gave out light and heat that made the  hut cozy and warm, but in the summer nights and days it gave out light  only. With their heads to the wall of the hut and their feet towards the  fire were two sleeping-couches--one of plain woodwork, in which slept  the old woman; the other was Finola's. It was of bog-oak, polished as  a looking-glass, and on it were carved flowers and birds of all kinds,  that gleamed and shone in the light of the fire. This couch was fit for  a princess, and a princess Finola was, though she did not know it  herself.    Outside the hut the bare, brown, lonely moor stretched for miles on  every side, but towards the east it was bounded by a range of mountains  that looked to Finola blue in the daytime, but which put on a hundred  changing colors as the sun went down. Nowhere was a house to be seen,  nor a tree, nor a flower, nor sign of any living thing. From morning  till night, nor hum of bee, nor song of bird, nor voice of man, nor any  sound fell on Finola's ear. When the storm was in the air the great  waves thundered on the shore beyond the mountains, and the wind shouted  in the glens; but when it sped across the moor it lost its voice, and  passed as silently as the dead. At first the silence frightened Finola,  but she got used to it after a time, and often broke it by talking to  herself and singing.    The only other person beside the old woman Finola ever saw was a dumb  dwarf who, mounted on a broken-down horse, came once a month to the hut,  bringing with him a sack of corn for the old woman and Finola. Although  he couldn't speak to her, Finola was always glad to see the dwarf and  his old horse, and she used to give them cake made with her own white  hands. As for the dwarf he would have died for the little princess, he  was so much in love with her, and often and often his heart was heavy  and sad as he thought of her pining away in the lonely moor.    It chanced that he came one day, and she did not, as usual, come out to  greet him. He made signs to the old woman, but she took up a stick and  struck him, and beat his horse and drove him away; but as he was leaving  he caught a glimpse of Finola at the door of the hut, and saw that she  was crying. This sight made him so very miserable that he could think of  nothing else but her sad face that he had always seen so bright, and he  allowed the old horse to go on without minding where he was going.  Suddenly he heard a voice saying: \"It is time for you to come.\"    The dwarf looked, and right before him, at the foot of a green hill, was  a little man not half as big as himself, dressed in a green jacket with  brass buttons, and a red cap and tassel.    \"It is time for you to come,\" he said the second time; \"but you are  welcome, anyhow.

(_From a MS._)]    [Illustration: MEDIEVAL FIREARMS.    (_From a MS._)]    [Illustration: MEDIEVAL PROJECTILES.    (_From a MS._)]    This was the city which Dragut took without a blow in the spring of  1550. Mahd[=i]ya was then in an anarchic state, ruled by a council of  chiefs, each ready to betray the other, and none owing the smallest  allegiance to any king, least of all the despised king of Tunis,  Ham[=i]d, who had deposed and blinded his father Hasan, Charles V.'s  _protege_. One of these chiefs let Dragut and his merry men into the  city by night, and the inhabitants woke up to find \"Africa\" in the  possession of the bold Corsair whose red and white ensign, displaying  a blue crescent, floated from the battlements.    So easy a triumph roused the emulation of Christendom. Where the Duke  of Bourbon had failed, Dragut had conspicuously succeeded. Don Garcia  de Toledo dreamed of outshining the Corsair's glory. His father, the  Viceroy of Naples, the Pope, and others, promised their aid, and old  Andrea Doria took the command. After much delay and consultation a  large body of troops was conveyed to Mahd[=i]ya, and disembarked on  June 28, 1550. Dragut, though aware of the project, was at sea,  devastating the Gulf of Genoa, and paying himself in advance for any  loss the Christians might inflict in Africa: his nephew, His[=a]r Reis  commanded in the city. When Dragut returned, the siege had gone on for  a month, without result; a tremendous assault had been repulsed with  heavy loss to the besiegers, who were growing disheartened. The  Corsair assembled a body of Moors and Turks and attempted to relieve  the fortress; but his ambuscade failed, His[=a]r's simultaneous sally  was driven back, and Dragut, seeing that he could do nothing, fled to  Jerba. His retreat gave fresh energy to the siege, and a change of  attack discovered the weak places of the defence. A vigorous assault  on the 8th of September carried the walls, a brisk street fight  ensued, and the strong city of \"Africa\" was in the hands of the  Christians.    The Sultan, Suleym[=a]n the Great, was little pleased to see a Moslem  fortress summarily stormed by the troops of his ally, the Emperor.  Charles replied that he had fought against pirates, not against the  Sultan's vassals; but Suleym[=a]n could not perceive the distinction,  and emphasized his disapproval by giving Dragut twenty galleys, which  soon found their way to Christian shores. The lamentations of his  victims roused Doria, who had the good fortune to surprise the Corsair  as he was greasing his keels in the strait behind Jerba. This strait  was virtually a _cul-de-sac_. Between the island and the great lake  that lay behind it, the sea had worn a narrow channel on the northern  side, through which light vessels could pass, with care; but to go out  of the lake by the southern side involved a voyage over what was  little better than a bog, and no one ever thought of the attempt.  Doria saw he had his enemy in a trap, and was in no hurry to venture  in among the shoals and narrows of the strait. He sent joyous messages  to Europe, announcing his triumph, and cautiously, as was his habit,  awaited events.    Dragut, for his part, dared not push out against a vastly superior  force; his only chance was a ruse. Accordingly, putting a bold face on  the matter, he manned a small earthwork with cannon, and played upon  the enemy, with little or no actual injury, beyond the all-important  effect of making Doria hesitate still more. Meanwhile, in the night,  while his little battery is perplexing the foe, all is prepared at the  southern extremity of the strait. Summoning a couple of thousand field  labourers, he sets them to work; here a small canal is dug--there  rollers come into play; and in a few hours his small fleet is safely  transported to the open water on the south side of the island. Calling  off his men from the illusive battery, the Corsair is off for the  Archipelago: by good luck he picks up a fine galley on the way, which  was conveying news of the reinforcements coming to Doria. The old  Genoese admiral never gets the message: he is rubbing his eyes in sore  amazement, wondering what had happened to the imprisoned fleet. Never  was admiral more cruelly cheated: never did Doria curse the nimble  Corsair with greater vehemence or better cause.    Next year, 1551, Dragut's place was with the Ottoman navy, then  commanded by Sin[=a]n Pasha. He had had enough of solitary roving,  and found it almost too exciting: he now preferred to hunt in couples.  With nearly a hundred and fifty galleys or galleots, ten thousand  soldiers, and numerous siege guns, Sin[=a]n and Dragut sailed out of  the Dardanelles--whither bound no Christian could tell. They ravaged,  as usual, the Straits of Messina, and then revealed the point of  attack by making direct for Malta. The Knights of St. John were a  perpetual thorn in the side of the Turks, and even more vexatious to  the Corsairs, whose vessels they, and they alone, dared to tackle  single-handed, and too often with success. Sultan and Corsair were  alike eager to dislodge the Knights from the rock which they had been  fortifying for twenty years, just as Suleym[=a]n had dislodged them  from Rhodes, which they had been fortifying for two hundred. In July  the Turkish fleet appeared before the Marsa, wholly unexpected by the  Knights. The Turks landed on the tongue of promontory which separates  the two great harbours, and where there was as yet no Fort St. Elmo to  molest them. Sin[=a]n was taken aback by the strong aspect of the  fortress of St. Angelo on the further side of the harbour, and almost  repented of his venture. To complete his dejection, he seems to have  courted failure. Instead of boldly throwing his whole force upon the  small garrison and overwhelming them by sheer weight, he tried a  reconnaissance, and fell into an ambuscade; upon which he  incontinently abandoned all thought of a siege, and contented himself  with laying waste the interior of Malta, and taking the adjacent  island of Goza.    The quantity of booty he would bring back to Constantinople might  perhaps avail, he thought, to keep his head on his shoulders, after so  conspicuous a failure; but Sin[=a]n preferred not to trust to the  chance. To wipe out his defeat, he sailed straight for Tripoli, some  sixty-four leagues away. Tripoli was the natural antidote to Malta:  for Tripoli, too, belonged to the Knights of St. John--much against  their will--inasmuch as the Emperor had made their defence of this  easternmost Barbary state a condition of their tenure of Malta. So far  they had been unable to put it into a proper state of defence, and  with crumbling battlements and a weak garrison, they had yearly  expected invasion. The hour had now come. Summoned to surrender, the  Commandant, Gaspard de Villiers, of the Auvergne Tongue, replied that  the city had been entrusted to his charge, and he would defend it to  the death. He had but four hundred men to hold the fort withal.    Six thousand Turks disembarked, forty cannons were landed, Sin[=a]n  himself directed every movement, and arranged his batteries and  earthworks. A heavy cannonade produced no effect on the walls, and the  Turkish admiral thought of the recent repulse at Malta, and of the  stern face of his master; and his head sat uneasily upon his neck. The  siege appeared to make no progress. Perhaps this venture, too, would  have failed, but for the treachery of a French renegade, who escaped  into the trenches and pointed out the weak places in the walls. His  counsel was taken; the walls fell down; the garrison, in weariness and  despair, had lain down to sleep off their troubles, and no reproaches  and blows could rouse them. On August 15th Gaspard de Villiers was  forced to surrender, on terms, as he believed, identical with those  which Suleym[=a]n granted to the Knights of Rhodes.[41] But Sin[=a]n  was no Suleym[=a]n; moreover, he was in a furious rage with the whole  Order. He put the garrison--all save a few--in chains, and carried  them off to grace his triumph at Stambol.    Thus did Tripoli fall once more into the hands of the Moslems,  forty-one years after its conquest by the Count Don Pedro Navarro.[42]    The misfortunes of the Christians did not end here. Year after year  the Ottoman fleet appeared in Italian waters, marshalled now by  Sin[=a]n, and when he died by Pi[=a]li Pasha the Croat, but always  with Dragut in the van; year by year the coasts of Apulia and Calabria  yielded up more and more of their treasure, their youth, and their  beauty, to the Moslem ravishers; yet worse was in store. Unable as  they felt themselves to cope with the Turks at sea, the Powers of  Southern Europe resolved to strike one more blow on land, and recover  Tripoli. A fleet of nearly a hundred galleys and ships, gathered from  Spain, Genoa, \"the Religion,\" the Pope, from all quarters, with the  Duke de Medina-Celi at the head, assembled at Messina. Doria was too  old to command, but his kinsman, Giovanni Andrea, son of his loved and  lost Giannettino, led the Genoese galleys. The Fates seemed adverse  from the outset. Five times the expedition put to sea; five times was  it driven back by contrary winds.[43] At last, on February 10, 1560,  it was fairly away for the African coast. Here fresh troubles awaited  it. Long delays in crowded vessels had produced their disastrous  effects: fevers and scurvy and dysentery were working their terrible  ravages among the "]]]
