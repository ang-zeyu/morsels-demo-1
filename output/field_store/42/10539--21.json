This, when  spun round, has the appearance of a string of tiny gold beads. It is  frequently used as an outlining thread.    Various gold twists and cords can be obtained; they are composed of  several threads twisted up in the usual cord fashion, each ply  consisting of gold spun round a silk thread.    _Plate_ is a flat strip of metal commonly about one-sixteenth of an inch  wide; it can be obtained in different widths.    _Spangles._--These are small variously shaped pieces of thin metal,  usually pierced with a hole in the centre for fixing on to the material.  They are frequently circular in shape, and either flat or slightly  concave; the latter are the prettier. Many fancy shapes also are  obtainable, but they are inclined to look tawdry, and suggestive of the  pantomime.    _Cloth of Gold and Silver._--This is a fabric manufactured of silk, with  gold or silver thread inwoven in the making. It is not now so much used  as formerly, when it was in great request for robes of kings and other  high dignitaries of church or state.    A special make of silk for couching down gold thread is obtainable in  various colours. It is called horsetail or sewings, and is both fine and  strong.    Padding for use in raised gold work is usually yellow, and for silver,  white or grey. Yellow soft cotton, linen thread, or silk, are all used  for the purpose.    Various precautions can and must be taken to keep the gold thread  bright, for under unfavourable circumstances it rapidly assumes a bad  colour; the silver thread is even more liable to tarnish than the gold,  and it turns a worse colour, going black. There is a special paper  manufactured to wrap threads in, and the stock supply should be kept in  a tin or air-tight bottle; this is in order to protect the metal from  damp, which is most injurious; to do this is a difficult matter in the  English climate. Linen used for working upon, or as backing, is best  unbleached, for sometimes the chemicals used in the bleaching process  have a deleterious effect upon the gold; a piece of gold embroidery  wrapped up in cotton wool for preservation has been found completely  spoiled by some chemical in this wool, which proved more disastrous than  exposure to air would have been. Gas, strong scents, handling  (especially with hot hands), all have an evil effect, and so should be  avoided as much as possible. Work even whilst in progress should be kept  covered as much as is practicable, and should not be allowed to hang  about; the quicker it is done the better. A piece of finished work can  be polished up with a leather pad or a brush, similar to a housemaid's  brush for silver-cleaning purposes; this of course, must be used with  care.      ANCIENT METHOD OF COUCHING    Gold thread can be couched on to the material in two distinct ways, one  of them in use at the present day, the other one that was commonly  practised in the XIIIth and XIVth centuries. About the second half of  the last-named century the earlier method was supplanted by the present  one. Almost every example of early gold thread work exhibits this  obsolete and ingenious method of couching. The Syon cope and the Jesse  cope in the Victoria and Albert Museum may be mentioned as famous  examples. M. Louis de Farcy[11] draws especial attention to this  beautiful method of working, to which he gives the name _point couche  rentre ou retire_, and strongly urges its revival; he points out many  distinct advantages it has over the method now in use.    The durability is very great, owing to the couching thread being upon  the reverse side, where it is protected from wear and tear, and being  out of sight can be made strong and durable. If a thread is accidentally  broken it does not necessarily give way along an entire line, as may  easily happen in the present method. A proof of this point can be seen  upon the beautiful Ascoli cope lately in the Victoria and Albert Museum,  about which there has been so much discussion of late as to in what  country it originated, and who was the rightful owner. The early  couching worked entirely over the background of the cope is in a state  of perfect preservation; portions of the gold thread drapery have here  and there been couched by the other method, the tying down threads have,  in those parts, mostly disappeared, and the gold hangs loose and ragged  upon the surface.    By the way in which it is worked, there results a particularly pleasing  and even surface, agreeably varied by play of light and shade. Another  advantage of the ancient method is that the completed work is very  flexible; this point will appeal to those who have experienced the  extreme stiffness of a large surface of ordinarily couched metal  threads. Flexibility is an invaluable quality for any work destined,  like copes and curtains, to hang in folds.    Representations of draperies upon figures are well expressed, for by the  way in which they are worked there comes an indentation along the lines  marking the folds; this emphasises them rather happily, and also breaks  up the surface in a satisfactory manner.    Fig. 125 is a diagram that will aid in explaining the working, it gives  both the front and the reverse side. This has been found to be the  simplest and the most practical method of obtaining a result similar to  the early examples; there is, however, no means other than examination  of result whereby to get at this obsolete method. To all appearance  there is upon the surface a kind of satin stitch worked in gold passing,  the stitches carrying out some geometrical pattern, such as a chevron or  lattice; but at the back a linen thread is seen running to and fro in  close parallel lines in the same direction as the surface thread, and at  regular intervals encircled by the gold passing, just as if this was  intended to couch down the linen thread.    [Illustration: Fig. 125. Front. Back.]    The ingenuity and satisfactoriness of the method must be admitted by all  who give it a trial, and it is interesting to conjecture how it may have  arisen. Possibly weaving suggested it to the embroiderers, for, take  away the intervening material, and it is not unlike woven work, and  these two arts would very likely be the accomplishment of the same  person. Perhaps the commonly used method of taking a coarse thread  through to the back (see fig. 167) suggested it, for this is briefly the  whole process.    In order to try the couching, a two-fold ground material must be firmly  stretched in an embroidery frame, a strong linen underneath and a  thinner closely woven one upon the upper side. Some fine gold passing  and some strong linen thread, well waxed, are required to work with,  also an embroidery needle with long eye and sharp point, the size, which  is important, depending upon the threads in use; the needle has to  pierce the two-fold ground material, making a hole only just large  enough for the passage of a double gold thread.    If the linen has a regular even thread the drawn pattern shown in the  diagram can be worked by counting the threads of the ground fabric, but  if this is difficult or impossible, as in the case say of a twilled  surface, a careful tracing must be made upon the linen; a beginner may  find this the easier way in any case.    The end of the gold thread, which by now, in readiness for working,  will be wound upon the bobbin or spindle, must be passed through to the  back at the starting-point, the top left-hand corner in the diagram. The  linen thread secures it at the back and then comes through to the front  upon the traced line exactly beneath (see arrow on plan). It now  encircles the gold thread which the left hand draws out rather tautly,  and then returns by the same hole to the back, pulling the metal thread  through with it. There is knack in taking the gold thread only just  through and leaving the completed stitch straight and flat upon the  surface. The process is now repeated, the linen thread coming through to  the front again upon the next traced line, and so on. When the base of  the pattern is reached the gold thread is taken through once upon that  line, and then commences a like journey upwards.    This practically explains the couching; variety is obtained by change of  pattern, but the method of carrying it out is always the same. Figs.  126, 127, and 128 show three patterns taken from old examples of this  couching.    [Illustration: Fig. 126.]    [Illustration: Fig. 127.]    The difficulties in technique are easily overcome; an important aid in  this matter is the use of materials exactly right; this means needles  and threads of the correct size, the ground composed of suitable  fabrics, and properly strained in a frame. The aim in the working is to  get each stitch perfectly flat and straight in its correct place in  spite of the obstinacy of the metal thread; to avoid making the  perforation larger than necessary, for this makes the work clumsy; to  make each succeeding line lie closely beside the last one, for the  surface must be of solid gold, and if the ground showed through in  places it would impoverish the effect.    [Illustration: Fig. 128.]    The direction of the couched thread is usually either vertical or  horizontal, and it may be both of these in the same piece of work.

I was at supper at his house, and  he was not inclined to let me leave him at my usual time. 'If you  go,' he said, 'there will be nothing for it but I must go to bed and  dream of the chrysalis.' 'You might be worse off,' said I. 'I do not  think it,' he said, and he shook himself like a man who is displeased  with the complexion of his thoughts. 'I only meant,' said I, 'that a  chrysalis is an innocent thing.' 'This one is not,' he said, 'and I do  not care to think of it.'    \"However, sooner than lose my company he was fain to tell me (for I  pressed him) that this was a dream which had come to him several times  of late, and even more than once in a night. It was to this effect,  that he seemed to himself to wake under an extreme compulsion to rise  and go out of doors. So he would dress himself and go down to his  garden door. By the door there stood a spade which he must take, and  go out into the garden, and at a particular place in the shrubbery  somewhat clear and upon which the moon shone, for there was always in  his dream a full moon, he would feel himself forced to dig. And after  some time the spade would uncover something light-coloured, which he  would perceive to be a stuff, linen or woollen, and this he must clear  with his hands. It was always the same: of the size of a man and  shaped like the chrysalis of a moth, with the folds showing a promise  of an opening at one end.    \"He could not describe how gladly he would have left all at this stage  and run to the house, but he must not escape so easily. So with many  groans, and knowing only too well what to expect, he parted these  folds of stuff, or, as it sometimes seemed to be, membrane, and  disclosed a head covered with a smooth pink skin, which breaking as  the creature stirred, showed him his own face in a state of death. The  telling of this so much disturbed him that I was forced out of mere  compassion to sit with him the greater part of the night and talk with  him upon indifferent subjects. He said that upon every recurrence of  this dream he woke and found himself, as it were, fighting for his  breath.\"    Another extract from Luke Jennett's long continuous statement comes in  at this point.    \"I never told tales of my master, Dr. Abell, to anybody in the  neighbourhood. When I was in another service I remember to have spoken  to my fellow-servants about the matter of the bedstaff, but I am sure  I never said either I or he were the persons concerned, and it met  with so little credit that I was affronted and thought best to keep it  to myself. And when I came back to Islington and found Dr. Abell still  there, who I was told had left the parish, I was clear that it behoved  me to use great discretion, for indeed I was afraid of the man, and it  is certain I was no party to spreading any ill report of him. My  master, Dr. Quinn, was a very just, honest man, and no maker of  mischief. I am sure he never stirred a finger nor said a word by way  of inducement to a soul to make them leave going to Dr. Abell and come  to him; nay, he would hardly be persuaded to attend them that came,  until he was convinced that if he did not they would send into the  town for a physician rather than do as they had hitherto done.    \"I believe it may be proved that Dr. Abell came into my master's house  more than once. We had a new chambermaid out of Hertfordshire, and she  asked me who was the gentleman that was looking after the master, that  is Dr. Quinn, when he was out, and seemed so disappointed that he was  out. She said whoever he was he knew the way of the house well,  running at once into the study and then into the dispensing-room, and  last into the bed-chamber. I made her tell me what he was like, and  what she said was suitable enough to Dr. Abell; but besides she told  me she saw the same man at church and some one told her that was the  Doctor.    \"It was just after this that my master began to have his bad nights,  and complained to me and other persons, and in particular what  discomfort he suffered from his pillow and bedclothes. He said he must  buy some to suit him, and should do his own marketing. And accordingly  brought home a parcel which he said was of the right quality, but  where he bought it we had then no knowledge, only they were marked in  thread with a coronet and a bird. The women said they were of a sort  not commonly met with and very fine, and my master said they were the  comfortablest he ever used, and he slept now both soft and deep. Also  the feather pillows were the best sorted and his head would sink into  them as if they were a cloud: which I have myself remarked several  times when I came to wake him of a morning, his face being almost hid  by the pillow closing over it.    \"I had never any communication with Dr. Abell after I came back to  Islington, but one day when he passed me in the street and asked me  whether I was not looking for another service, to which I answered I  was very well suited where I was, but he said I was a tickle-minded  fellow and he doubted not he should soon hear I was on the world  again, which indeed proved true.\"    Dr. Pratt is next taken up where he left off.    \"On the 16th I was called up out of my bed soon after it was  light--that is about five--with a message that Dr. Quinn was dead or  dying. Making my way to his house I found there was no doubt which was  the truth. All the persons in the house except the one that let me in  were already in his chamber and standing about his bed, but none  touching him. He was stretched in the midst of the bed, on his back,  without any disorder, and indeed had the appearance of one ready laid  out for burial. His hands, I think, were even crossed on his breast.  The only thing not usual was that nothing was to be seen of his face,  the two ends of the pillow or bolster appearing to be closed quite  over it. These I immediately pulled apart, at the same time rebuking  those present, and especially the man, for not at once coming to the  assistance of his master. He, however, only looked at me and shook  his head, having evidently no more hope than myself that there was  anything but a corpse before us.    \"Indeed it was plain to any one possessed of the least experience that  he was not only dead, but had died of suffocation. Nor could it be  conceived that his death was accidentally caused by the mere folding  of the pillow over his face. How should he not, feeling the  oppression, have lifted his hands to put it away? whereas not a fold  of the sheet which was closely gathered about him, as I now observed,  was disordered. The next thing was to procure a physician. I had  bethought me of this on leaving my house, and sent on the messenger  who had come to me to Dr. Abell; but I now heard that he was away from  home, and the nearest surgeon was got, who however could tell no more,  at least without opening the body, than we already knew.    \"As to any person entering the room with evil purpose (which was the  next point to be cleared), it was visible that the bolts of the door  were burst from their stanchions, and the stanchions broken away from  the door-post by main force; and there was a sufficient body of  witness, the smith among them, to testify that this had been done but  a few minutes before I came. The chamber being moreover at the top of  the house, the window was neither easy of access nor did it show any  sign of an exit made that way, either by marks upon the sill or  footprints below upon soft mould.\"    The surgeon's evidence forms of course part of the report of the  inquest, but since it has nothing but remarks upon the healthy state  of the larger organs and the coagulation of blood in various parts of  the body, it need not be reproduced. The verdict was \"Death by the  visitation of God.\"    Annexed to the other papers is one which I was at first inclined to  suppose had made its way among them by mistake. Upon further  consideration I think I can divine a reason for its presence.    It relates to the rifling of a mausoleum in Middlesex which stood in a  park (now broken up), the property of a noble family which I will not  name. The outrage was not that of an ordinary resurrection man. The  object, it seemed likely, was theft. The account is blunt and  terrible. I shall not quote it. A dealer in the North of London  suffered heavy penalties as a receiver of stolen goods in connexion  with the affair.           *       *       *       *       *    _Printed in Great Britain by_  UNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED, THE GRESHAM PRESS, WOKING"]]]
