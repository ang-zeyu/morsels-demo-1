And then a familiar feeling assailed  her, one she never failed to have upon returning to her father's  ranch--a reluctance, a bitter dissatisfaction with her home, a loyal  struggle against the vague sense that all was not as it should be.    At the head of this canyon in a little, level, grassy meadow stood a  rude one-room log shack, with a leaning red-stone chimney on the  outside. This was the abode of a strange old man who had long lived  there.  His name was John Sprague and his occupation was raising  burros.  No sheep or cattle or horses did he own, not even a dog.  Rumor had said Sprague was a prospector, one of the many who had  searched that country for the Lost Dutchman gold mine.  Sprague knew  more about the Basin and Rim than any of the sheepmen or ranchers.  From Black Butte to the Cibique and from Chevelon Butte to Reno Pass he  knew every trail, canyon, ridge, and spring, and could find his way to  them on the darkest night.  His fame, however, depended mostly upon the  fact that he did nothing but raise burros, and would raise none but  black burros with white faces. These burros were the finest bred in all  the Basin and were in great demand.  Sprague sold a few every year.  He  had made a present of one to Ellen, although he hated to part with  them.  This old man was Ellen's one and only friend.    Upon her trip out to the Rim with the sheep, Uncle John, as Ellen  called him, had been away on one of his infrequent visits to Grass  Valley.  It pleased her now to see a blue column of smoke lazily  lifting from the old chimney and to hear the discordant bray of burros.  As she entered the clearing Sprague saw her from the door of his shack.    \"Hello, Uncle John!\" she called.    \"Wal, if it ain't Ellen!\" he replied, heartily.  \"When I seen thet  white-faced jinny I knowed who was leadin' her.  Where you been, girl?\"    Sprague was a little, stoop-shouldered old man, with grizzled head and  face, and shrewd gray eyes that beamed kindly on her over his ruddy  cheeks.  Ellen did not like the tobacco stain on his grizzled beard nor  the dirty, motley, ragged, ill-smelling garb he wore, but she had  ceased her useless attempts to make him more cleanly.    \"I've been herdin' sheep,\" replied Ellen.  \"And where have y'u been,  uncle?  I missed y'u on the way over.\"    \"Been packin' in some grub.  An' I reckon I stayed longer in Grass  Valley than I recollect.  But thet was only natural, considerin'--\"    \"What?\" asked Ellen, bluntly, as the old man paused.    Sprague took a black pipe out of his vest pocket and began rimming the  bowl with his fingers.  The glance he bent on Ellen was thoughtful and  earnest, and so kind that she feared it was pity.  Ellen suddenly  burned for news from the village.    \"Wal, come in an' set down, won't you?\" he asked.    \"No, thanks,\" replied Ellen, and she took a seat on the chopping block.  \"Tell me, uncle, what's goin' on down in the Valley?\"    \"Nothin' much yet--except talk.  An' there's a heap of thet.\"    \"Humph!  There always was talk,\" declared Ellen, contemptuously. \"A  nasty, gossipy, catty hole, that Grass Valley!\"    \"Ellen, thar's goin' to be war--a bloody war in the ole Tonto Basin,\"  went on Sprague, seriously.    \"War! ... Between whom?\"    \"The Isbels an' their enemies.  I reckon most people down thar, an'  sure all the cattlemen, air on old Gass's side.  Blaisdell, Gordon,  Fredericks, Blue--they'll all be in it.\"    \"Who are they goin' to fight?\" queried Ellen, sharply.    \"Wal, the open talk is thet the sheepmen are forcin' this war.  But  thar's talk not so open, an' I reckon not very healthy for any man to  whisper hyarbouts.\"    \"Uncle John, y'u needn't be afraid to tell me anythin',\" said Ellen.  \"I'd never give y'u away.  Y'u've been a good friend to me.\"    \"Reckon I want to be, Ellen,\" he returned, nodding his shaggy head. \"It  ain't easy to be fond of you as I am an' keep my mouth shet.... I'd  like to know somethin'.  Hev you any relatives away from hyar thet you  could go to till this fight's over?\"    \"No.  All I have, so far as I know, are right heah.\"    \"How aboot friends?\"    \"Uncle John, I have none,\" she said, sadly, with bowed head.    \"Wal, wal, I'm sorry.  I was hopin' you might git away.\"    She lifted her face.  \"Shore y'u don't think I'd run off if my dad got  in a fight?\" she flashed.    \"I hope you will.\"    \"I'm a Jorth,\" she said, darkly, and dropped her head again.    Sprague nodded gloomily.  Evidently he was perplexed and worried, and  strongly swayed by affection for her.    \"Would you go away with me?\" he asked.  \"We could pack over to the  Mazatzals an' live thar till this blows over.\"    \"Thank y'u, Uncle John.  Y'u're kind and good.  But I'll stay with my  father.  His troubles are mine.\"    \"Ahuh! ... Wal, I might hev reckoned so.... Ellen, how do you stand on  this hyar sheep an' cattle question?\"    \"I think what's fair for one is fair for another.  I don't like sheep  as much as I like cattle.  But that's not the point.  The range is  free. Suppose y'u had cattle and I had sheep.  I'd feel as free to run  my sheep anywhere as y'u were to ran your cattle.\"    \"Right.  But what if you throwed your sheep round my range an' sheeped  off the grass so my cattle would hev to move or starve?\"    \"Shore I wouldn't throw my sheep round y'ur range,\" she declared,  stoutly.    \"Wal, you've answered half of the question.  An' now supposin' a lot of  my cattle was stolen by rustlers, but not a single one of your sheep.  What 'd you think then?\"    \"I'd shore think rustlers chose to steal cattle because there was no  profit in stealin' sheep.\"    \"Egzactly.  But wouldn't you hev a queer idee aboot it?\"    \"I don't know.  Why queer?  What 're y'u drivin' at, Uncle John?\"    \"Wal, wouldn't you git kind of a hunch thet the rustlers was--say a  leetle friendly toward the sheepmen?\"    Ellen felt a sudden vibrating shock.  The blood rushed to her temples.  Trembling all over, she rose.    \"Uncle John!\" she cried.    \"Now, girl, you needn't fire up thet way.  Set down an' don't--\"    \"Dare y'u insinuate my father has--\"    \"Ellen, I ain't insinuatin' nothin',\" interrupted the old man.  \"I'm  jest askin' you to think.  Thet's all.  You're 'most grown into a young  woman now.  An' you've got sense.  Thar's bad times ahead, Ellen. An' I  hate to see you mix in them.\"    \"Oh, y'u do make me think,\" replied Ellen, with smarting tears in her  eyes.  \"Y'u make me unhappy.  Oh, I know my dad is not liked in this  cattle country.  But it's unjust.  He happened to go in for sheep  raising.  I wish he hadn't.  It was a mistake.  Dad always was a  cattleman till we came heah.  He made enemies--who--who ruined him. And  everywhere misfortune crossed his trail.... But, oh, Uncle John, my dad  is an honest man.\"    \"Wal, child, I--I didn't mean to--to make you cry,\" said the old man,  feelingly, and he averted his troubled gaze.  \"Never mind what I said.  I'm an old meddler.  I reckon nothin' I could do or say would ever  change what's goin' to happen.  If only you wasn't a girl! ... Thar I  go ag'in.  Ellen, face your future an' fight your way.  All youngsters  hev to do thet.  An' it's the right kind of fight thet makes the right  kind of man or woman.  Only you must be sure to find yourself.  An' by  thet I mean to find the real, true, honest-to-God best in you an' stick  to it an' die fightin' for it.  You're a young woman, almost, an' a  blamed handsome one.  Which means you'll hev more trouble an' a harder  fight.  This country ain't easy on a woman when once slander has marked  her.    \"What do I care for the talk down in that Basin?\" returned Ellen. \"I  know they think I'm a hussy.  I've let them think it. I've helped them  to.\"    \"You're wrong, child,\" said Sprague, earnestly.  \"Pride an' temper! You  must never let anyone think bad of you, much less help them to.\"    \"I hate everybody down there,\" cried Ellen, passionately.  \"I hate them  so I'd glory in their thinkin' me bad.... My mother belonged to the  best blood in Texas.  I am her daughter.  I know WHO AND WHAT I AM.  That uplifts me whenever I meet the sneaky, sly suspicions of these  Basin people.  It shows me the difference between them and me. That's  what I glory in.\"    \"Ellen, you're a wild, headstrong child,\" rejoined the old man, in  severe tones.  \"Word has been passed ag'in' your good name--your  honor.... An' hevn't you given cause fer thet?\"    Ellen felt her face blanch and all her blood rush back to her heart in  sickening force.  The shock of his words was like a stab from a cold  blade.  If their meaning and the stem, just light of the old man's  glance did not kill her pride and vanity they surely killed her  girlishness.  She stood mute, staring at him, with her brown, trembling  hands stealing up toward her bosom, as if to ward off another and a  mortal blow.    \"Ellen!\" burst out Sprague, hoarsely.  \"You mistook me.  Aw, I didn't  mean--what you think, I swear.... Ellen, I'm old an' blunt.  I ain't  used to wimmen.  But I've love for you, child, an' respect, jest the  same as if you was my own.... An' I KNOW you're good.... Forgive me....  I meant only hevn't you been, say, sort of--careless?\"    \"Care-less?\" queried Ellen, bitterly and low.    \"An' powerful thoughtless an'--an' blind--lettin' men kiss you an'  fondle you--when you're really a growed-up woman now?\"    \"Yes--I have,\" whispered Ellen.    \"Wal, then, why did you let them?    \"I--I don't know.... I didn't think.  The men never let me  alone--never--never!  I got tired everlastingly pushin' them away.  And  sometimes--when they were kind--and I was lonely for something I--I  didn't mind if one or another fooled round me.  I never thought. It  never looked as y'u have made it look....

On the other side of the  frontier lies the Eastern Pamir, in the dominion of the Emperor of  China.      \"THE FATHER OF ICE-MOUNTAINS\"    Wherever one may be in the Eastern Pamir one sees the Mus-tagh-ata, the  \"Father of Ice-Mountains,\" rear its rounded summit above all the other  peaks (see map, p. 56). Its height is 25,800 feet, and accordingly it is  one of the loftiest mountains in the world. On its arched crest snow  collects, and its under layers are converted by pressure into ice. The  mountain is therefore crowned by a snow-covered ice-cap. Where there are  flat hollows round the summit, in these also snow is piled up as in  bowls. It glides slowly down with its own weight, and by pressure from  above is here also converted into ice. Thus are produced great tongues  of ice, which move downwards exceedingly slowly, perhaps only a few  yards in the year. They are enclosed between huge steep ridges, from  which time after time gravel and blocks of stone fall down on to the ice  and are carried down to lower levels. The further the ice descends the  warmer becomes the air, and then the ice melts in the sun. As it melts  below, the stream of ice is forced down from above, so that its lowest  margin is always to be found in the same place. The gravel and boulders  are brought down thither and piled up together so as to form great  mounds and ridges, which are called moraines. The ice-stream itself is  called a glacier. Many such tongues of ice fringe Mus-tagh-ata on all  sides. They are several miles long and half a mile to a mile broad. The  surface is very uneven and consists of innumerable knobs and pyramids of  clear ice.    I made several excursions on the glaciers of Mus-tagh-ata on foot or on  yaks. One must be well shod so as not to slip, and one must look out for  crevasses. Once we were stopped by a crevasse several yards broad and  forty-five feet deep. When we stooped over the brim and looked down, it  had the appearance of a dark-blue grotto with walls of polished glass,  and long icicles hung down from the edges. Streamlets of melted ice run  over the surface of the glacier, sometimes flowing quietly and gently as  oil in the greenish-blue ice channels, sometimes murmuring in lively  leaps. The water can be heard trickling and bubbling at the bottom of  the crevasses, and the surface brooks often form fine waterfalls which  disappear into chasms of ice. On warm days when the sun shines, thawing  proceeds everywhere, and the water trickles, bubbles, and runs all about  the ice. But if the weather is dull, cold, and raw, the glaciers are  quieter, and when winter comes with its severe cold they are quite hard  and still, and the brooks freeze into ice.    The yaks of the Kirghizes are wonderfully sure-footed, and one can ride  on them over slippery hillocky ice where a man could not possibly walk.  The yak thrusts down his hoofs so that the white powdered ice spurts up  around him, and if the slope is so steep that he cannot get foothold, he  stretches out all four legs and holds them stiff and rigid as iron and  thus slides down without tumbling. Sometimes I rode over moraine heaps  of huge granite blocks piled one upon another. Then I had to take a firm  grip with my knees, for the yak springs and jumps about like a lunatic.    Accompanied by specially selected Kirghizes, I tried four times to climb  to the top of the \"Father of Ice-Mountains,\" but always without success.  Our camp was pitched high up among the moraines. Islam Bay, six  Kirghizes, and ten yaks were in readiness before sunrise, and we took  with us ample provisions, fur coats, spades and alpenstocks, food and a  tent. At first we climbed up over gravel, and then over snow which  became deeper the higher we went. As the air became rarer, respiration  was more difficult, and even the yaks halted frequently to recover their  breath. The Kirghizes walked on foot and urged the animals up towards  the giddy heights. It took us the whole day to reach a point 20,700 feet  above sea-level. At this point we halted for the night, intending to  push on higher in the morning, but two of the Kirghizes were so overcome  with weariness and headaches that they asked to be allowed to go down  again. The others shovelled away the snow and pitched the little tent  within a wall of snow. A fire was kindled and the tea-kettle put on, but  our appetites were poor, as we were suffering from mountain sickness.  The ten yaks stood tethered in the snow outside, and the Kirghizes  curled themselves up in their skin coats like hedgehogs. The full moon  soared like a silvery white balloon just above the top of the mountain,  and I left the tent to enjoy this never-to-be-forgotten spectacle. The  glacier below us lay in shadow in its deep bed, but the snow-fields were  dazzling white. The yaks stood out jet black against the snow, their  nostrils steaming, and the snow crunching under them. Light white clouds  floated rapidly from the mountain under the moon. At last I returned to  the tent. The fire had died down, and the recently melted snow had  frozen into ice. There was a smell of damp and smoke inside, and the men  groaned and complained of headache and singing in the ears. I crawled  under my furs, but could not sleep. The night was quiet, but at times a  dull report was heard when a crevasse was formed in the ice or a boulder  fell from the mountain-side.    When I crawled out from under my furs in the morning, a violent  snowstorm was sweeping along the flanks of the mountain. Through the  dense cloud of whirling snow we could not see our way, and it would have  been death to mount to still higher regions. We might be glad if we  could struggle down again alive in such weather, so down we started  through the drifts, down headlong. We all needed a thorough rest after  this experience.    On another occasion we had a perilous adventure on the rounded ice-cap  of Mus-tagh-ata. We were marching upwards as usual, suspecting no  danger, when the foremost yak, which carried two large bundles of fuel,  suddenly sank through the snow and disappeared. Fortunately he was held  fast by his horns, a hind leg, and the faggots, and there he hung  suspended over a dark yawning chasm. The snow had formed a treacherous  bridge over a large crevasse in the ice, and this bridge gave way under  the weight of the yak. We had all the trouble in the world to haul him  up again with ropes.      A KIRGHIZ GYMKHANA    At the foot of Mus-tagh-ata there is a level and extensive valley, where  grass thrives luxuriantly. The black tents of the Kirghizes stand  scattered about like spots on a panther's skin. I hired one of these  tents for the summer of 1904, and spent several very interesting months  in studying the habits and mode of life of the people. If the weather  was fine, I made long excursions on horseback or on a yak, and compiled  a map of the surrounding country. If rain poured down, I kept inside my  own tent, or visited my Kirghiz neighbours and talked with them, for by  that time I had learned to speak their language.    Round the large hive-shaped tents fierce dogs keep watch, and small  naked sunburnt children tumble about in play. They are charmingly sweet,  and it is hard to believe that they will grow up into tall rough  half-wild Kirghizes. But all children are attractive and lovable before  life and mankind have hardened them. In the tent sit the young women,  spinning thread or weaving cloth; the older women are busy with the sour  milk and butter behind a partition in the tent, or perhaps they are  sitting round a pot, cooking meat. A fire is always burning in the  middle of the tent, and the smoke finds its way out through a round  opening in the top. The young men are out with the sheep or are looking  after the yaks grazing in the mountains. The older men repair saddles  and boots, make harness for horses or household utensils. Sometimes they  go hunting after wild sheep and goats. When the sun sets the sheep are  driven into folds near the tent; the women milk the ewes and yak-cows.  During the night a watch is kept on account of the wolves. The Kirghizes  are Mohammedans, and are often heard intoning Arabic prayers outside the  tents.    Not many days had passed before I was on friendly terms with all the  Kirghizes. They perceived that I wished them well, and was glad to live  among them. They came from far and near and gave me presents--sheep and  milk, wild sheep they had shot, and mountain partridges. All my servants  except Islam Bay were Kirghizes, and they followed me willingly wherever  I chose to travel.    One day the chiefs of the Kirghizes decided to hold a grand festival in  my honour. It was to be a _baiga_, or gymkhana, and early in the morning  small parties of horsemen were seen gathering to the great plain where  the wild sport was to take place.    When the sun was at its height I was escorted to the arena by forty-two  Kirghizes, who rode beside and behind me. In their best clothes,  coloured mantles with girdles and embroidered caps, and with their  daggers and knives, fire steel, pipe and tobacco box rattling at their  sides, they presented a stately and festal appearance. Among them might  be noticed the chief of the Kirghizes who lived on the eastern side of  Mus-tagh-ata. His long mantle was dark blue, his girdle light blue; on  his head he had a violet cap with a gold border, and at his side dangled  a scimitar in a black scabbard. The chief himself was tall, with a thin  black beard, scanty moustaches, small oblique eyes and high cheek bones,  like most Kirghizes.    The plain in front of us was black with horsemen and horses; there was  bustle, neighing, and stamping on all sides. Here the high chief, Khoat  Bek, a hundred and eleven years"]]]
