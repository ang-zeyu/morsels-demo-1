Then Joshua and the Israelites pretended to be beaten and fled toward  the wilderness; and all the people that were in the town were called  together to pursue them. So they left the town unguarded and pursued the  Israelites. Then the men who were hiding rose quickly out of their place  and set the town on fire. When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the  smoke of the town rising to heaven; and they had no chance to flee this  way or that, for the Israelites who had been fleeing to the wilderness  turned back upon those who were following them. When the smoke of the  town rose up, the rest of the Israelites came out of the town against  them; so they were surrounded by the Israelites, some on this side, and  some on that, so that they let none of the people of Ai remain or  escape.      WOMEN WHO SAVED A NATION    Later Sisera, who had nine hundred iron chariots, cruelly oppressed the  Israelites for twenty years. Then the prophetess Deborah, the wife of  Lappidoth, delivered Israel. She used to sit under the palm-tree of  Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the highlands of Ephraim; and the  Israelites went to her to have her decide their disputes.    She sent and called Barak, the son of Abinoam, from Kadesh Naphtali and  said to him, \"Does not Jehovah the God of Israel command you: 'Go, march  to Mount Tabor and take with you ten thousand of the Naphtalites and of  the Zebulunites? Then I will draw out to you at the brook Kishon Sisera  with his chariots and his troops, and I will deliver him into your  hands.'\" Barak said to her, \"If you will go with me, I will go, but if  you will not go with me, I will not go.\" She replied, \"I will certainly  go with you, only you will not have the glory in this expedition on  which you are going, for Jehovah will deliver Sisera into the hands of a  woman.\"    So Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kadesh. Barak called the  Zebulunites and the Naphtalites together at Kadesh and ten thousand men  followed him; and Deborah also went up with him.    Now Heber the Kenite had left the Kenites, the children of Jethro the  father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak  which is near Kadesh.    When it was reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up  to Mount Tabor, Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred  iron chariots, and all his people from the heathen city Harosheth to the  brook Kishon. Then Deborah said to Barak, \"To the attack! for to-day  Jehovah has delivered Sisera into your hands. Has not Jehovah gone out  before you?\"    So Barak went down from Mount Tabor followed by ten thousand men; and at  the attack of Barak's swordsmen Jehovah put to flight Sisera and his  chariots and all his forces, and Sisera got down from his war-chariot  and fled on foot. But Barak pursued the chariots and the forces to  Harosheth; and all the army of Sisera was destroyed by the sword; not a  single man was left.    On that day Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang this song:            \"O Jehovah, when thou wentest from Seir,           Marching from the region of Edom,           Earth trembled, the heavens swayed,           The clouds also dripped water;           The hills quaked before Jehovah,           Yon Sinai, before Israel's God.            \"In the days of Anath's son, Shamgar,           In Jael's days the roads were unused,           And travellers walked through byways.           Leaders disappeared in Israel,           Until you, O Deborah, rose,           Till you rose as a mother in Israel.            \"My heart is with the commanders of Israel,           Who volunteered among the people. Bless Jehovah!           You who ride on tawny asses,           Who sit upon rich saddle-cloths;           You who walk by the way, tell of it.           Far from sounds of dividing the spoil,           In the places where water is drawn,           Let them tell of Jehovah's righteous acts,           And the righteous deeds of his leaders!            \"Then the people of Jehovah           Went down to the gates, crying:           'Awake, awake, O Deborah,           Awake, awake, sing a battle-song!           Rise up, rise up, O Barak,           Take your captives, O son of Abinoam!'            \"So they went down against the powerful,           The Lord's people against the mighty.           From Machir, commanders went down,           From Zebulun, standard-bearers,           Issachar's princes with Deborah,           And with Barak, the men of Naphtali;           Into the valley they streamed after him.            \"Zebulun risked its life,           Naphtali on the heights of the field.           Rulers came, they fought,           The rulers of Canaan fought           At Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.            \"They took no booty of silver,           For from heaven the very stars fought,           From their courses they fought against Sisera.           The brook Kishon swept them away,           That ancient brook, the brook Kishon.           O my soul, march on with strength!           Then did their horse hoofs pound           With the gallop, gallop of steeds.            \"Blessed above women shall Jael be,           That wife of Heber, the Kenite,           More blessed than all nomad women!           Water he asked, milk she gave,           Curdled milk she brought him           In a bowl well fitted for lords!           She put her hand to the tent-pin,           Her right hand to the workman's hammer.           She struck Sisera, crushing his head,           She shattered, she pierced his temples.           At her feet he sank down and lay still,           At her feet he sank, he fell;           There he fell, a victim slain!            \"Through the window she peered and cried,           Through the lattice, the mother of Sisera:           'Why so long his chariot in coming?           Why tarry the hoof-beats of steeds?'           Then the wisest of her ladies replied,           She herself also answered her question,           'Are they not dividing the spoil?           A woman or two for each warrior,           For Sisera a spoil of dyed stuffs,           A spoil of dyed stuffs embroidered,           Some pieces of lace for his neck?'            \"So perish thy foes, O Jehovah!           But may those who love him be as the sun,           Rising up in invincible splendor!\"      GIDEON'S BRAVE BAND    In course of time the Midianites conquered the Israelites. To escape  them the Israelites made for themselves dens in the mountains and caves  and strongholds. When the Israelites had sown their crops, the  Midianites would come up and leave nothing for the Israelites to live  on, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass; for they came up with their cattle  and their tents. The Israelites were so robbed by the Midianites, that  they cried to Jehovah for help.    Then the angel of Jehovah came and sat down under the oak which was in  Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezerite; and his son, Gideon, was  beating out wheat in the wine-press to hide it from the Midianites. The  angel of Jehovah appeared to him and said, \"Jehovah is with you, able  warrior!\" Gideon said to him, \"O my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why  then has all this overtaken us? Where are all his wonderful acts of  which our fathers told us, saying, 'Did not Jehovah bring us from  Egypt?' But now Jehovah has cast us off and given us into the power of  the Midianites.\"    Then Jehovah turned to him and said, \"With this strength which you have  go and save Israel from the rule of the Midianites: do I not send you?\"  But Gideon said to him, \"O Jehovah, how can I save Israel? See, my  family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's  house.\" Jehovah said to him, \"I will surely be with you, and you shall  overthrow the Midianites as if they were only one man.\"    Then the spirit of Jehovah took possession of Gideon, and he sounded the  war trumpet, and the Abiezerites assembled under his leadership. He also  sent messengers throughout all the land of the Manassites, and they  assembled under his leadership; and he sent messengers to the Asherites,  the Zebulunites, and the Naphtalites, and they went up to join him. But  Jehovah said to Gideon, \"You have too many people with you; if I give  the Midianites up to the Israelites they will boast, 'We have saved  ourselves!' Therefore, proclaim to your people, 'Whoever is afraid may  go home.'\"    Then Gideon separated them, so that twenty-two thousand of the people  went back home, but ten thousand stayed. But Jehovah said to him, \"The  people are still too many; take them down to the water, and I will try  them out for you there. Every one of whom I say to you, 'This one shall  go with you,' shall go with you; and every one of whom I say to you,  'This one shall not go with you,' shall not go.\"    So Gideon brought the people down to the water. And Jehovah said to him,  \"You shall put by themselves all who lap the water with their tongues,  as a dog laps, and all who kneel down on their knees to drink by  themselves.\" The number of those who lapped with their tongue, putting  their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men; but all the rest of  the people knelt down on their knees to drink. Then Jehovah said to  Gideon, \"By the three hundred men who lapped I will save you and deliver  the Midianites into your hands. Let all the rest of the people go home.\"  So they took the food that the people had in their hands, and their  trumpets; and Gideon sent home all the other Israelites, keeping only  the three hundred men.    Then Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed it, and the three hundred men  were with him, faint yet pursuing. And he said to the men of Succoth,  \"Give, I beg of you, loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for  they are faint and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#17)"],[1,"builders and their satellites, wherever they came,  destruction so wide-spread that there is not a town in France or Italy  but it has to deplore the deliberate overthrow of more than half its  noblest monuments, in order to put up Greek porticoes or palaces in  their stead; adding also all the blame of the ignorance of the meaner  kind of men, operating in thousands of miserable abuses upon the  frescoes, books, and pictures, as the architects' hammers did on the  carved work, of the Middle Ages;[26] and, finally, if we examine the  influence which the luxury, and, still more, the heathenism, joined with  the essential dullness of these schools, have had on the upper class of  society, it will ultimately be found that no expressions are energetic  enough to describe, nor broad enough to embrace, the enormous moral  evils which have risen from them.    [Footnote 26: Nothing appears to me much more wonderful, than the  remorseless way in which the educated ignorance, even of the present  day, will sweep away an ancient monument, if its preservation be not  absolutely consistent with immediate convenience or economy. Putting  aside all antiquarian considerations, and all artistical ones, I wish  that people would only consider the steps and the weight of the  following very simple argument. You allow it is wrong to waste time,  that is, your own time; but then it must be still more wrong to waste  other people's; for you have some right to your own time, but none to  theirs. Well, then, if it is thus wrong to waste the time of the living,  it must be still more wrong to waste the time of the dead; for the  living can redeem their time, the dead cannot. But you waste the best of  the time of the dead when you destroy the works they have left you; for  to those works they gave the best of their time, intending them for  immortality.]    75. I omitted, in preparing the preceding lecture for the press, a  passage referring to this subject, because it appeared to me, in its  place, hardly explained by preceding statements. But I give it here  unaltered, as being, in sober earnest, but too weak to characterize the  tendencies of the \"accursed\" architecture of which it speaks.    \"Accursed, I call it, with deliberate purpose. It needed but the  gathering up of a Babylonish garment to trouble Israel;--these marble  garments of the ancient idols of the Gentiles, how many have _they_  troubled! Gathered out of their ruins by the second Babylon,--gathered  by the Papal Church in the extremity of her sin;--raised up by her, not  when she was sending forth her champions to preach in the highway, and  pine in the desert, and perish in the fire, but in the very scarlet  fruitage and fullness of her guilt, when her priests vested themselves  not with purple only, but with blood, and bade the cups of their  feasting foam not with wine only, but with hemlock;--raised by the hands  of the Leos and the Borgias, raised first into that mighty temple where  the seven hills slope to the Tiber, that marks by its massy dome the  central spot, where Rome has reversed the words of Christ, and, as He  vivified the stone to the apostleship, she petrifies the apostleship  into the stumbling stone;--exalted there first as if to mark what work  it had to do, it went forth to paralyze or to pollute, and wherever it  came, the luster faded from the streets of our cities, the gray towers  and glorious arches of our abbeys fell by the river sides, the love of  nature was uprooted from the hearts of men, base luxuries and cruel  formalisms were festered and frozen into them from their youth; and at  last, where, from his fair Gothic chapel beside the Seine, the king St.  Louis had gone forth, followed by his thousands in the cause of Christ,  another king was dragged forth from the gates of his Renaissance  palace,[27] to die, by the hands of the thousands of his people gathered  in another crusade; or what shall that be called--whose sign was not the  cross, but the guillotine?\"    [Footnote 27: The character of Renaissance architecture, and the spirit  which dictated its adoption, may be remembered as having been centered  and symbolized in the palace of Versailles; whose site was chosen by  Louis the Fourteenth, in order that from thence he might _not_ see St.  Denis, the burial-place of his family. The cost of the palace in  twenty-seven years is stated in \"The Builder,\" for March 18th, 1854, to  have been L3,246,000 money of that period, equal to about seven millions  now (L900,000 having been expended in the year 1686 alone). The building  is thus notably illustrative of the two feelings which were stated in  the \"Stones of Venice,\" to be peculiarly characteristic of the  Renaissance spirit, the Pride of State and Fear of Death. Compare the  horror of Louis the Fourteenth at the sight of the tower of St. Denis,  with the feeling which prompted the Scaligeri at Verona to set their  tombs within fifteen feet of their palace walls.]    76. I have not space here to pursue the subject farther, nor shall I be  able to write anything more respecting architecture for some time to  come. But in the meanwhile, I would most earnestly desire to leave with  the reader this one subject of thought--\"_The Life of the Workman._\" For  it is singular, and far more than singular, that among all the writers  who have attempted to examine the principles stated in the \"Stones of  Venice,\" not one[28] has as yet made a single comment on what was  precisely and accurately the most important chapter in the whole book;  namely, the description of the nature of Gothic architecture, as  involving the liberty of the workman (vol. ii. ch. vi.). I had hoped  that whatever might be the prejudices of modern architects, there would  have been found some among them quicksighted enough to see the bearings  of this principle, and generous enough to support it. There has hitherto  stood forward not _one_.    [Footnote 28: An article in _Fraser's Magazine_, which has appeared  since these sheets were sent to press, forms a solitary exception.]    But my purpose must at last be accomplished for all this. The laborer  among the gravestones of our modern architecture must yet be raised up,  and become a living soul. Before he can be thus raised, the whole system  of Greek architecture, as practiced in the present day, must be  annihilated; but it _will_ be annihilated, and that speedily. For truth  and judgment are its declared opposites, and against these nothing ever  finally prevailed, or shall prevail.          LECTURE III.    TURNER AND HIS WORKS.    _Delivered November 15, 1853._      77. My object this evening is not so much to give you any account of the  works or the genius of the great painter whom we have so lately lost  (which it would require rather a year than an hour to do), as to give  you some idea of the position which his works hold with respect to the  landscape of other periods, and of the general condition and prospects  of the landscape art of the present day. I will not lose time in  prefatory remarks, as I have little enough at any rate, but will enter  abruptly on my subject.    78. You are all of you well aware that landscape seems hardly to have  exercised any strong influence, as such, on any pagan nation or pagan  artist. I have no time to enter into any details on this, of course,  most intricate and difficult subject; but I will only ask you to  observe, that wherever natural scenery is alluded to by the ancients, it  is either agriculturally, with the kind of feeling that a good Scotch  farmer has; sensually, in the enjoyment of sun or shade, cool winds or  sweet scents; fearfully, in a mere vulgar dread of rocks and desolate  places, as compared with the comfort of cities; or, finally,  superstitiously, in the personification or deification of natural  powers, generally with much degradation of their impressiveness, as in  the paltry fables of Ulysses receiving the winds in bags from AEolus, and  of the Cyclops hammering lightning sharp at the ends, on an anvil.[29]  Of course, you will here and there find feeble evidences of a higher  sensibility, chiefly, I think, in Plato, AEschylus, Aristophanes, and  Virgil. Homer, though in the epithets he applies to landscape always  thoroughly graphic, uses the same epithet for rocks, seas, and trees,  from one end of his poem to the other, evidently without the smallest  interest in anything of the kind; and in the mass of heathen writers,  the absence of sensation on these subjects is singularly painful. For  instance, in that, to my mind, most disgusting of all so-called poems,  the Journey to Brundusium, you remember that Horace takes exactly as  much interest in the scenery he is passing through as Sancho Panza would  have done.    [Footnote 29: Of course I do not mean by calling these fables \"paltry,\"  to dispute their neatness, ingenuity, or moral depth; but only their  want of apprehension of the extent and awfulness of the phenomena  introduced. So also, in denying Homer's interest in nature, I do not  mean to deny his accuracy of observation, or his power of seizing on the  main points of landscape, but I deny the power of landscape over his  heart, unless when closely associated with, and altogether subordinate  to, some human interest.]    79. You will find, on the other hand, that the language of the Bible is  specifically distinguished from all other early literature, by its  delight in natural imagery; and that the dealings of God with His people  are calculated peculiarly to awaken this sensibility within them. Out of  the monotonous valley of Egypt they are instantly taken into the midst  of the mightiest mountain scenery in the peninsula of Arabia; and that  scenery is associated in their minds with the immediate manifestation  and presence of the Divine Power; so that mountains forever afterwards  become invested with a peculiar sacredness in their minds: while their  descendants "]]]
