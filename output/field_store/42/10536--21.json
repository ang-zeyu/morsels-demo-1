[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#17)"],[1," a most curious  manner. For example, consider the following verses from the cantilena  of St. Eulalie, as given by M. Gautier, p. 65:         \"Buona pulcella fut Eulalia;       Bel avret corps, bellezour anima.       Voldrent la vientre li Deo inimi,       Voldrent la faire diaule servir.       Elle n'out eskoltet les mal conselliers       Qu'elle Deo raniet chi maent sus en ciel.\"    Which being somewhat freely rendered into English, it says that:         \"A good virgin was Eulalia;       She had a beautiful body, more beautiful spirit;       The enemies of God would conquer her,       Would make her serve the devil;       But never would she understand the evil ones who counsel       To deny God, who is above all in heaven.\"    And so the ballad goes on twenty-three verses more to narrate how she  withstood the exhortations of the king of the pagans, that she would  forsake the name of Christian; and when they threw her into the fire  the fire would not burn her, for the fire was pure; and when the king  drew his sword to cut off her head the _demoiselle_ did not contradict  him, for she wished to leave the world. She prayed to Christ, and  under the form of a dove she flew away toward heaven. These charming  verses of the ninth century were probably sung to music having little  of the movement which we now associate with the term melody, but which  was more of a chant-like character.    Of similar literary texture were a multitude of songs, of which many  different ones related to the same hero. Hence in time there was a  disposition on the part of the cleverer minstrels to combine them into  a single narration, and to impart to the whole so composed something  of an epic character. Thus arose the famous _Chansons de Geste_  already mentioned, the origin and general character of which have been  most happily elucidated in the work of M. Gautier, already referred  to. He says:    \"The great epics of the French had their origin in the romantic and  commanding deeds of Charlemagne and the battles against Saracens in  792. The fate of civilization trembled in the balance at Ville Daigne  and at Poitiers. It is the lot of Christianity, it is the lot of the  world, which is at stake. The innumerable murders, the torrents of  blood, these thousands of deaths have had their sure effect upon  history. The world has been Christian in place of being Arab. It  appertains to Jesus instead of Mahomet. This civilization, of which we  are so proud, this beauty of the domestic circle, this independence of  our spirit, this free character of our wives and children it is to  Charles Martelle, and above all to William of Orange, that we owe  them, after God. We possess only a limited number of these primitive  epics, the _Chansons de Geste_, and are not certain that we have them  in the second or even the third versions. At the head of the list we  place the 'Song of Roland,' the Iliad of France. All the other songs  of action, however beautiful and however ancient they may be, are far  inferior. The text of the 'Song of Roland' as it has come down to us  cannot have been written much before 1100. Besides this there is the  '_Chanson de Nimes_,' '_Ogier le Danois_,' '_Jour de Blaibes_,' all of  which were written in the languages of Oc and Oil. All these have  something in common; the verse is ten syllables, the correspondences  are assonances and not rhymes. In style these _Chansons de Geste_ are  rapid, military, but above all dramatic and popular. They are without  shading, spontaneous, no labor, no false art, no study. Above all it  is a style to which one can apply the words of Montaigne, and it is  the same upon paper as in the mouth. Really these verses are made to  be upon the living lip, and not upon the cold and dead parchment of  the manuscript. The oldest manuscripts are small, in order that they  may be carried in the pocket for use of traveling jongleurs and  singers. They have Homeric epithets. The style is singularly grave.  There is nothing to raise a laugh. The first epics were popular about  the end of the eleventh century. The idea of woman is purer in the  early poems. There is no description of the body; there is no  gallantry. The beautiful Aude apprehends the death of Roland; she  falls dead. In the second half of the twelfth century our poets would  have been incapable of so simple and noble a conception. We find, even  in '_Amis et Amelis_,' women who are still very German in physiognomy,  and alluring, but they are Germans, so to say, of the second manner.  They have a habit of throwing themselves into the arms of the first  man who takes their fancy.    \"Each one of the races which composed France or Gaul in the sixth or  seventh century, contributed its share toward the future epics. The  Celts furnished their character, the Romans their language, the Church  its faith; but the Germans did more. For long centuries they had the  habit of chanting in popular verse their origin, their victories and  their heroes. Above all they penetrated the new poetry with their new  spirit. All the German ideas upon war, royalty, family and government,  upon woman and right, passed into the epic of the French.    \"Our fathers had no epics, it is true, but they had popular chants,  rapid, ardent and short, which are precisely what we have called  cantilenas. A cantilena is at the same time a recitation and an ode.  It is at times a complaint and more often a round. It is a hymn, above  all religious and musical, which runs over the lips and which, thanks  to its brevity, mainly, is easily graven upon the memory. The  cantilenas were a power in society; they caused the most powerful to  tremble. When a captain wished to nerve himself up against a bad  action he said, 'They will make a bad song about me.'    \"The heroes and the deeds which gave birth to French epics are those  of the commencement of the eighth century to the end of the tenth.  France is then more than a mere land; it is a country; a single  religious faith fills all hearts and all intelligence. Toward the end  of the tenth century we see the popular singers arresting crowds in  all public places. They sing poems of 3,000 or 4,000 verses. These are  the first of the _Chansons de Geste_. Out of the great number of  cantilenas dedicated to a single hero it happened that some poet had  the happy thought of combining them into a single poem. Thus came a  suite of pieces about Roland or William, and from these, in time, an  epic. The latest of the epic cycles was that concerning the crusades.  The style is popular, rapid, easy to sing. It recalls the Homeric  poetry. The constant epithets, the military enumerations, the  discourses of the heroes before combat, and the idea of God, are  simple, childlike, and superstition has no place. The supernatural  exists in plenty, but no marvels.\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER IX.    THE TROUBADOURS, TROUVERES AND MINNESINGERS.      To the full account of the origin of the _Chansons de Geste_ in the  foregoing chapter, it remains now to add a few notes concerning the  _personnel_ of the different classes of minstrels through whose  efforts these great songs were created.    The first of these singers were the troubadours, who were traveling  minstrels especially gifted in versification and in music. Their  compositions appear to have been short, on the whole, and of various  kinds, as will presently be seen. The earliest of the troubadours of  whom we have definite account was Count Wilhelm of Poitiers,  1087-1127. Among the kind of songs cultivated by these singers were  love songs, canzonets, chansons; serenade--that is, an evening song;  auberde, or day song; servantes, written to extol the goodness of  princes; tenzone, quarrelsome or contemptuous songs; and roundelays,  terminated forever with the same refrain. There was also what was  called the pastourelle, a make-believe shepherd's song.    The so-called chansonniers of the north, who flourished toward the end  of the twelfth century, were also troubadours. Among them the name of  Count Thibaut of Champagne, king of Navarre, stands celebrated--1201-1253.  He composed both religious and secular songs. The following is one of  his melodies unharmonized. Its date is about the same as that of  \"Summer is Coming In.\" Another celebrated name of these minstrels was  Adam de la Halle, of Arras in Picardy--1240-1286. Upon many accounts  the music of this author is of considerable interest to us. He was a  good natural melodist, as the examples in Coussemaker's \"Adam de la  Halle\" show. He is also the author of the earliest comic opera of  which we have any account, the play of \"Robin and Marion.\" We shall  speak of this later, in connection with the development of opera in  general.    [Music illustration:         L'autrier par la ma-ti-ne-e,       En-tre un bois et un ver-gier       U-ne pastoure ai trou-ve-e       Chantant pour soi en-voi-sier,       Et di-soit un son pre-mier       'Chi me tient li maus d'amor.'       Tan-tost ce-le part m'entor,       Ka je l'oi des rais-ner;       Si li dis sans de-la-ier.       Bel-le Diex vous doint bon-jor.]    Immediately following the troubadours came the trouveres, who were  simply troubadours of nobler birth, and perhaps of finer imagination.  There were so many of these singers that it is quite impossible here  to give a list of their names. Among the more celebrated, forty-two  names are given by Fetis, the most familiar among them being those of  Blondel, the minstrel of Richard Coeur de Lion, and the Chatelaine  de Coucy (died about 1192), from whom we have twenty-three chansons.    It was the trouveres who invented the _Chansons de Geste_ already  mentioned--songs of action; in other words, ballads. One of the most  celebrated of these was the \"Story of Antioch,\" a romance of the  crusades, extending to more than 15,000 lines. This poem was not  intended to be read, but was chanted by the minstrels during the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#17)"],[1,"titles borne by  Enki or Ea. The time of their creation is indicated as after that  of \"cattle, beasts of the field and creatures of the city\", and the  composition opens in a way which is very like the opening of the present  passage in our text.(2) In neither text is there any idea of giving  a complete account of the creation of the world, only so much of the  original myth being included in each case as suffices for the writer's  purpose. Here we may assume that the creation of mankind and of animals  is recorded because they were to be saved from the Flood, and that of  the _niggilma_ because of the part it played in ensuring their survival.         (1) See Hilprecht, _Babylonian Expedition_, Series D, Vol.       V, Fasc. 1, plate, Rev., l. 8; the photographic reproduction       clearly shows, as Dr. Poebel suggests (_Hist. Texts_, p. 61       n 3), that the line should read: _((isu)elippu) si-i lu       (isu)ma-gur-gur-ma sum-sa lu na-si-rat na-pis-tim_, \"That       ship shall be a _magurgurru_ (giant boat), and its name       shall be 'Preserver of Life' (lit. 'She that preserves       life').\"         (2) See _Seven Tablets of Creation_, Vol. I, pp. 122 ff. The       text opens with the words \"When the gods in their assembly       had made (the world), and had created the heavens, and had       formed the earth, and had brought living creatures into       being . . .\", the lines forming an introduction to the       special act of creation with which the composition was       concerned.    The discussion of the meaning of _niggilma_ may best be postponed till  the Sixth Column, where we find other references to the word. Meanwhile  it may be noted that in the present passage the creation of man precedes  that of animals, as it did in the earlier Hebrew Version of Creation,  and probably also in the Babylonian version, though not in the later  Hebrew Version. It may be added that in another Sumerian account of the  Creation(1) the same order, of man before animals, is followed.         (1) Cf. _Sev. Tabl._, Vol. I, p. 134 f.; but the text has       been subjected to editing, and some of its episodes are       obviously displaced.          II. THE ANTEDILUVIAN CITIES    As we saw was the case with the First Column of the text, the earliest  part preserved of the Second Column contains the close of a speech by a  deity, in which he proclaims an act he is about to perform. Here we may  assume with some confidence that the speaker is Anu or Enlil, preferably  the latter, since it would be natural to ascribe the political  constitution of Babylonia, the foundation of which is foreshadowed, to  the head of the Sumerian pantheon. It would appear that a beginning had  already been made in the establishment of \"the kingdom\", and, before  proceeding to his further work of founding the Antediluvian cities, he  follows the example of the speaker in the First Column of the text and  lays down the divine enactments by which his purpose was accomplished.  The same refrain is repeated:         The sub(lime decrees) he made perfect for it.    The text then relates the founding by the god of five cities, probably  \"in clean places\", that is to say on hallowed ground. He calls each by  its name and assigns it to its own divine patron or city-god:         (In clean place)s he founded (five) cit(ies).         And after he had called their names and they had been       allotted to divine rulers(?),--         The . . . of these cities, Eridu, he gave to the leader, Nu-       dimmud,         Secondly, to Nugira(?) he gave Bad-. . .,(1)         Thirdly, Larak he gave to Pabilkharsag,         Fourthly, Sippar he gave to the hero, the Sun-god,         Fifthly, Shuruppak he gave to \"the God of Shuruppak\",--         After he had called the names of these cities, and they had       been allotted to divine rulers(?),         (1) In Semitic-Babylonian the first component of this city-       name would read \"Dur\".    The completion of the sentence, in the last two lines of the column,  cannot be rendered with any certainty, but the passage appears to have  related the creation of small rivers and pools. It will be noted that  the lines which contain the names of the five cities and their patron  gods(1) form a long explanatory parenthesis, the preceding line being  repeated after their enumeration.         (1) The precise meaning of the sign-group here provisionally       rendered \"divine ruler\" is not yet ascertained.    As the first of the series of five cities of Eridu, the seat of Nudimmud  or Enki, who was the third of the creating deities, it has been urged  that the upper part of the Second Column must have included an account  of the founding of Erech, the city of Anu, and of Nippur, Enlil's  city.(1) But the numbered sequence of the cities would be difficult to  reconcile with the earlier creation of other cities in the text, and  the mention of Eridu as the first city to be created would be quite  in accord with its great age and peculiarly sacred character as a  cult-centre. Moreover the evidence of the Sumerian Dynastic List is  definitely against any claim of Erech to Antediluvian existence. For  when the hegemony passed from the first Post-diluvian \"kingdom\" to the  second, it went not to Erech but to the shrine Eanna, which gave its  name to the second \"kingdom\"; and the city itself was apparently not  founded before the reign of Enmerkar, the second occupant of the throne,  who is the first to be given the title \"King of Erech\". This conclusion  with regard to Erech incidentally disposes of the arguments for Nippur's  Antediluvian rank in primitive Sumerian tradition, which have been  founded on the order of the cities mentioned at the beginning of the  later Sumerian myth of Creation.(2) The evidence we thus obtain that the  early Sumerians themselves regarded Eridu as the first city in the world  to be created, increases the hope that future excavation at Abu Shahrain  may reveal Sumerian remains of periods which, from an archaeological  standpoint, must still be regarded as prehistoric.         (1) Cf. Poebel, op. cit., p. 41.         (2) The city of Nippur does not occur among the first four       \"kingdoms\" of the Sumerian Dynastic List; but we may       probably assume that it was the seat of at least one early       \"kingdom\", in consequence of which Enlil, its city-god,       attained his later pre-eminent rank in the Sumerian       pantheon.    It is noteworthy that no human rulers are mentioned in connexion with  Eridu and the other four Antediluvian cities; and Ziusudu, the hero  of the story, is apparently the only mortal whose name occurred in  our text. But its author's principal subject is the Deluge, and the  preceding history of the world is clearly not given in detail, but is  merely summarized. In view of the obviously abbreviated form of the  narrative, of which we have already noted striking evidence in its  account of the Creation, we may conclude that in the fuller form of  the tradition the cities were also assigned human rulers, each one  the representative of his city-god. These would correspond to the  Antediluvian dynasty of Berossus, the last member of which was  Xisuthros, the later counterpart of Ziusudu.    In support of the exclusion of Nippur and Erech from the myth, it will  be noted that the second city in the list is not Adab,(1) which was  probably the principal seat of the goddess Ninkharsagga, the fourth of  the creating deities. The names of both deity and city in that line  are strange to us. Larak, the third city in the series, is of greater  interest, for it is clearly Larankha, which according to Berossus  was the seat of the eighth and ninth of his Antediluvian kings. In  commercial documents of the Persian period, which have been found during  the excavations at Nippur, Larak is described as lying \"on the bank of  the old Tigris\", a phrase which must be taken as referring to the Shatt  el-Hai, in view of the situation of Lagash and other early cities  upon it or in its immediate neighbourhood. The site of the city should  perhaps be sought on the upper course of the stream, where it tends  to approach Nippur. It would thus have lain in the neighbourhood of  Bismaya, the site of Adab. Like Adab, Lagash, Shuruppak, and other early  Sumerian cities, it was probably destroyed and deserted at a very early  period, though it was reoccupied under its old name in Neo-Babylonian or  Persian times. Its early disappearance from Babylonian history perhaps  in part accounts for our own unfamiliarity with Pabilkharsag, its  city-god, unless we may regard the name as a variant from of Pabilsag;  but it is hardly likely that the two should be identified.         (1) The site of Adab, now marked by the mounds of Bismaya,       was partially excavated by an expedition sent out in 1903 by       the University of Chicago, and has provided valuable       material for the study of the earliest Sumerian period; see       _Reports of the Expedition of the Oriental Exploration Fund_       (Babylonian Section of the University of Chicago), and       Banks, _Bismya_ (1912). On grounds of antiquity alone we       might perhaps have expected its inclusion in the myth.    In Sibbar, the fourth of the Antediluvian cities in our series, we  again have a parallel to Berossus. It has long been recognized that  Pantibiblon, or Pantibiblia, from which the third, fourth, fifth, sixth,  and seventh of his Antediluvian kings all came, was the city of Sippar  in Northern Babylonia. For the seventh of these rulers, {Euedorakhos},  is clearly Enmeduranki, the mythical king of Sippar, who in Babylonian  tradition was regarded as the founder of divination. In a fragmentary  composition that has come down to us he is described, not only as king  of Sippar, but as \"beloved of Anu, Enlil, and Enki\", the three creating  gods of our text; and it is there recounted how the patron deities of  divination, Shamash and"]]]
