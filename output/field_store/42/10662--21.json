PHIL. No, sir. Whatever is not prose, is verse; and whatever       is not verse, is prose.         M. JOUR.And when we speak, what is that, then?         PROF. PHIL. Prose.         M. JOUR. What! when I say, \"Nicole, bring me my slippers, and give       me my nightcap,\" is that prose?         PROF. PHIL. Yes, sir.         M. JOUR. Upon my word, I have been speaking prose these forty years       without being aware of it; and I am under the greatest obligation       to you for informing me of it. Well, then, I wish to write to her       in a letter, \"Fair Marchioness, your beautiful eyes make me die of       love;\" but I would have this worded in a genteel manner, and turned       prettily.         PROF. PHIL. Say that the fire of her eyes has reduced your heart to       ashes; that you suffer day and night for her, tortures--         M. JOUR. No, no, no, I don't any of that. I simply wish for what I       tell you,--\"Fair Marchioness, your beautiful eyes make me die of       love.\"         PROF. PHIL. Still, you might amplify the thing a little.         M. JOUR. No, I tell you, I will have nothing but these very words       in the letter; but they must be put in a fashionable way, and       arranged as they should be. Pray show me a little, so that I may       see the different ways in which they can be put.         PROF. PHIL. They may be put first of all, as you have said, \"Fair       Marchioness, your beautiful eyes make me die of love;\" or else, \"Of       love die make me, fair Marchioness, your beautiful eyes;\" or, \"Your       beautiful eyes of love make me, fair Marchioness, die;\" or, \"Die of       love your beautiful eyes, fair Marchioness, make me;\" or else, \"Me       make your beautiful eyes die, fair Marchioness, of love.\"         M. JOUR. But of all these ways, which is the best?         PROF. PHIL. The one you said,--\"Fair Marchioness, your beautiful       eyes make me die of love.\"         M. JOUR. Yet I have never studied, and I did all right off at the       first shot.    The \"Bourgeois Gentilhomme\" is a very amusing comedy throughout.    From \"Les Femmes Savantes\" (\"The Learned Women\")--\"The Blue-Stockings,\"  we might perhaps freely render the title--we present one scene to  indicate the nature of the comedy. There had grown to be a fashion in  Paris, among certain women high in social rank, of pretending to the  distinction of skill in literary criticism, and of proficiency in  science. It was the Hotel de Rambouillet reduced to absurdity. That  fashionable affectation Moliere made the subject of his comedy, \"The  Learned Women.\"    In the following extracts, Moliere satirizes, under the name of  Trissotin, a contemporary writer, one Cotin. The poem which Trissotin  reads for the learned women to criticise and admire, is an actual  production of this gentleman. Imagine the domestic _coterie_ assembled,  and Trissotin, the poet, their guest. He is present, prepared to regale  them with what he calls his sonnet. We need to explain that the original  poem is thus inscribed: \"To Mademoiselle de Longueville, now Duchess of  Namur, on her Quartan Fever.\" The conceit of the sonneteer is that the  fever is an enemy luxuriously lodged in the lovely person of its victim,  and there insidiously plotting against her life:--         TRISSOTIN. Sonnet to the Princess Urania on her Fever, Your       prudence sure is fast asleep, That thus luxuriously you keep And       lodge magnificently so Your very hardest-hearted foe.         BELISE. Ah! what a pretty beginning!         ARMANDE. What a charming turn it has!         PHILAMINTE. He alone possesses the talent of making easy verses.         ARM. We must yield to _prudence fast asleep_.         BEL. _Lodge one's very hardest-hearted foe_ is full of charms for       me.         PHIL. I like _luxuriously_ and _magnificently_: these two adverbs       joined together sound admirably.         BEL. Let us hear the rest.         TRISS. Your prudence sure is fast asleep, That thus luxuriously you       keep And lodge magnificently so Your very hardest-hearted foe.         ARM. _Prudence fast asleep._         BEL. _To lodge one's foe._         PHIL. _Luxuriously_ and _magnificently_.         TRISS. Drive forth that foe, whate'er men say, From out your       chamber, decked so gay, Where, ingrate vile, with murderous knife,       Bold she assails your lovely life.         BEL. Ah! gently. Allow me to breathe, I beseech you.         ARM.Give us time to admire, I beg.         PHIL. One feels, at hearing these verses, an indescribable       something which goes through one's inmost soul, and makes one feel       quite faint.         ARM. Drive forth that foe, whate'er men say, From out your chamber,       decked so gay--         How prettily _chamber, decked so gay_, is said here! And with what       wit the metaphor is introduced!         PHIL. Drive forth that foe, whate'er men say.         Ah! in what an admirable taste that _whate'er men say _is! To my       mind, the passage is invaluable.         ARM. My heart is also in love with _whate'er men say_.         BEL. I am of your opinion: _whate'er men say_ is a happy       expression.         ARM. I wish I had written it.         BEL. It is worth a whole poem.         PHIL. But do you, like me, thoroughly understand the wit of it?         ARM. _and_ BEL. Oh! Oh!         PHIL. Drive forth that foe, whate'er men say. Although another       should take the fever's part, pay no attention; laugh at the       gossips.          Drive forth that foe, whate'er men say,        Whate'er men say, whate'er men say.    This _whate'er men say_, says a great deal more than it seems. I do not  know if every one is like me, but I discover in it a hundred meanings.         BEL. It is true that it says more than its size seems to imply.         PHIL. (_to_ TRISSOTIN). But when you wrote this charming _whate'er       men say_, did you yourself understand all its energy? Did you       realize all that it tells us? And did you then think that you were       writing something so witty?         TRISS. Ah! ah!         ARM. I have likewise the _ingrate_ in my head,--this ungrateful,       unjust, uncivil fever that ill-treats people who entertain her.         PHIL. In short, both the stanzas are admirable. Let us come quickly       to the triplets, I pray.         ARM. Ah! once more, _whate'er men say_, I beg.         TRISS. Drive forth that foe, whate'er men say,--         PHIL., ARM., _and_ BEL. _Whate'er men say!_         TRISS. From out your chamber, decked so gay,--         PHIL., ARM., _and_ BEL. _Chamber decked so gay!_         TRISS. Where, ingrate vile, with murderous knife,--         PHIL., ARM., _and_ BEL. That _ingrate_ fever!         TRISS. Bold she assails your lovely life.         PHIL. _Your lovely life!_         ARM. _and_ BEL. Ah!         TRISS. What! reckless of your ladyhood, Still fiercely seeks to       shed your blood,--         PHIL., ARM., _and_ BEL. Ah!         TRISS. And day and night to work you harm. When to the baths       sometime you've brought her, No more ado, with your own arm Whelm       her and drown her in the water.         PHIL. Ah! It is quite overpowering.         BEL. I faint.         ARM. I die from pleasure.         PHIL. A thousand sweet thrills seize one.         ARM. _When to the baths sometime you've brought her,_         BEL. _No more ado, with your own arm_         PHIL. _Whelm her and drown her in the water._ With your own arm,       drown her there in the baths.         ARM. In your verses we meet at each step with charming beauty.         BEL. One promenades through them with rapture.         PHIL. One treads on fine things only.         ARM. They are little lanes all strewn with roses.         TRISS. Then, the sonnet seems to you--         PHIL. Admirable, new; and never did any one make any thing more       beautiful.         BEL. (_to_ HENRIETTE). What! my niece, you listen to what has been       read without emotion! You play there but a sorry part!         HEN. We each of us play the best part we can, my aunt; and to be a       wit does not depend on our will.         TRISS. My verses, perhaps, are tedious to you.         HEN. No. I do not listen.         PHIL. Ah! Let us hear the epigram.    But our readers, we think, will consent to spare the epigram. They will  relish, however, a fragment taken from a subsequent part of the same  protracted scene. The conversation has made the transition from literary  criticism to philosophy, in Moliere's time a fashionable study rendered  such by the contemporary genius and fame of Descartes. Armande resents  the limitations imposed upon her sex:--         ARM. It is insulting our sex too grossly to limit our intelligence       to the power of judging of a skirt, of the make of a garment, of       the beauties of lace, or of a new brocade.         BEL. We must rise above this shameful condition, and bravely       proclaim our emancipation.         TRISS. Every one knows my respect for the fairer sex, and that, if       I render homage to the brightness of their eyes, I also honor the       splendor of their intellect.         PHIL. And our sex does you justice in this respect: but we will       show to certain minds who treat us with proud contempt, that women       also have knowledge; that, like men, they can hold learned       meetings--regulated, too, by better rules; that they wish to unite       what elsewhere is kept apart, join noble language to deep learning,       reveal nature's laws by a thousand experiments; and, on all       questions proposed, admit every party, and ally themselves to none.         TRISS. For order, I prefer peripateticism.         PHIL. For abstractions, I love platonism.         ARM. Epicurus pleases me, for his tenets are solid.         BEL. I agree with the doctrine of atoms; but I find it difficult to   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23050"],[0,"Peter Biddulph: The Story of an Australian Settler (#17)"],[1,"companions.  Their fate has been that of hundreds who  have attempted to follow the same course.  It made a deep impression on  Arthur Wells, who ultimately became, through God's grace, a thoroughly  changed man.    I was not disappointed in any of my expectations.  God prospered me on  every side.  I was able to purchase more sheep in the course of another  year, so that my flocks rapidly increased.  Small flocks, as may be  supposed, do not pay.  In the course of time we got up a better and  larger house.  We wanted one indeed, for our family increased in a way  we had not expected.  Charley White was engaged, I should have said, to  my eldest girl, Mary; and just before they were to be married he started  off in the dray to Sydney.  Whether or not Mary knew why he had gone we  could not tell.  He was a very short time absent, and when the dray  appeared, there, seated under an awning in front, was a nice-looking old  lady, and Mary exclaimed, \"That's Aunt Priscilla,\" but instead of her  cats she was accompanied by two young ladies.    It appeared that Charley had been sending home such glowing accounts of  the colony, that Miss Beamish was seized with a strong desire to come  out and join her nephew; and, like a sagacious woman, had brought out  with her the commodity just then and ever since most required, in the  shape of two honest, well-educated, nice-looking girls.  Peter and Mark  took a great fancy to them, and before long they became their wives.    Miss Beamish got a grant of land close to mine, on which Charley put up  a house for her, he and his wife living with her and managing the farm,  which she, indeed, made over to him and his heirs, of whom there were,  in the course of a few years, no small number.    I was soon able to start Peter in an estate of his own; and Mark a few  years afterwards.    Arthur Wells obtained a free pardon and married Susan.  I did not  consider that his having been a convict should be a bar to their  marriage, for I never met a more thoroughly reformed character.  He made  her an excellent husband.    All my children married as they grew up--the girls at an early age, but  the boys had to wait some time before they could find suitable wives.  However, in the course of years--I need not say how many--all my  children happily married, were settled either with me on my original  property, much increased both in value and size, or else on estates  around me.    I have been greatly blessed in life.  I have, however, a difficulty  which I do not think I shall ever get over--it is to remember the names  of my grand-children.  Already upwards of fifty muster together at our  family meetings, and as far as I can judge, that number may be more than  doubled in the course of a few years.    Australia still affords a fine field for settlers, but they must be  industrious, persevering, and energetic; idlers, rogues, and vagabonds  will starve there, as everywhere else.  As in most parts of the world so  in Australia; trust in God, industry, and perseverance will conquer all  difficulties and lead on to success."]]]
