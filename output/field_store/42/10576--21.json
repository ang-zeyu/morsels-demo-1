He called a council at Prague Castle, summoned the nobles and  knights before him, ordered them to deliver up their treasonable papers,  came down on many with heavy fines, and condemned the ringleaders to  death.    At eight in the morning, August 22nd, four Barons were led out to  execution in Prague, and the scaffold was erected in a public place that  all the people might see and learn a lesson. Among the Barons was Wenzel  Petipesky, a member of the Brethren's Church. He was to be the first to  die. As he was led from his cell by the executioner, he called out in a  loud voice, which could be heard far and wide: \"My dear Brethren, we go  happy in the name of the Lord, for we go in the narrow way.\" He walked  to the scaffold with his hands bound before him, and two boys played his  dead march on drums. As he reached the scaffold the drums ceased, and  the executioner announced that the prisoner was dying because he had  tried to dethrone King Ferdinand and put another King in his place.    \"That,\" said Petipesky, \"was never the case.\"    \"Never mind, my Lord,\" roared the executioner, \"it will not help you  now.\"    \"My God,\" said Petipesky, \"I leave all to Thee;\" and his head rolled on  the ground.    But the worst was still to come. As Ferdinand came out of the castle  church on Sunday morning, September 18th, he was met by a deputation of  Utraquists and Catholics, who besought him to protect them against the  cruelties inflicted on them by the Picards. The King soon eased their  minds. He had heard a rumour that John Augusta was the real leader of  the revolt; he regarded the Brethren as traitors; he no longer felt  bound by his promise to spare them; and, therefore, reviving the Edict  of St. James, he issued an order that all their meetings should be  suppressed, all their property be confiscated, all their churches be  purified and transformed into Romanist Chapels, and all their priests  be captured and brought to the castle in Prague {Oct. 8th, 1547.}. The  Brethren pleaded not guilty.[38] They had not, as a body, taken any part  in the conspiracy against the King. Instead of plotting against him, in  fact, they had prayed and fasted in every parish for the kingdom and the  throne. If the King, they protested, desired to punish the few guilty  Brethren, by all means let him do so; but let him not crush the innocent  many for the sake of a guilty few. \"My word,\" replied the King, \"is  final.\" The Brethren continued to protest. And the King retorted by  issuing an order that all Brethren who lived on Royal estates must  either accept the Catholic Faith or leave the country before six weeks  were over {May, 1548.}.    And never was King more astounded and staggered than Ferdinand at the  result of this decree.          CHAPTER IX. -- THE BRETHREN IN POLAND, 1548-1570.    It is easy to see what Ferdinand expected. He had no desire to shed more  blood; he wished to see Bohemia at peace; he knew that the Brethren,  with all their skill, could never sell out in six weeks; and therefore  he hoped that, like sensible men, they would abandon their Satanic  follies, consider the comfort of their wives and children, and nestle  snugly in the bosom of the Church of Rome. But the Brethren had never  learned the art of dancing to Ferdinand's piping. As the King would not  extend the time, they took him at his word. The rich came to the help  of the poor,[39] and before the six weeks had flown away a large band  of Brethren had bidden a sad farewell to their old familiar haunts and  homes, and started on their journey north across the pine-clad hills.  From Leitomischl, Chlumitz and Solnic, by way of Frankenstein and  Breslau, and from Turnau and Brandeis-on-the-Adler across the Giant  Mountains, they marched in two main bodies from Bohemia to Poland. The  time was the leafy month of June, and the first part of the journey was  pleasant. \"We were borne,\" says one, \"on eagles' wings.\" As they  tramped along the country roads, with wagons for the women, old men  and children, they made the air ring with the gladsome music of old  Brethren's hymns and their march was more like a triumphal procession  than the flight of persecuted refugees. They were nearly two thousand  in number. They had hundreds with them, both Catholic and Protestant, to  protect them against the mountain brigands. They had guards of infantry  and cavalry. They were freed from toll at the turn-pikes. They were  supplied with meat, bread, milk and eggs by the simple country peasants.  They were publicly welcomed and entertained by the Mayor and Council of  Glatz. As the news of their approach ran on before, the good folk in the  various towns and villages would sweep the streets and clear the road to  let them pass with speed and safety to their desired haven far away.  For two months they enjoyed themselves at Posen, and the Polish nobles  welcomed them as Brothers; but the Bishop regarded them as wolves in  the flock, and had them ordered away. From Posen they marched to Polish  Prussia, and were ordered away again; and not till the autumn leaves  had fallen and the dark long nights had come did they find a home in the  town of Koenigsberg, in the Lutheran Duchy of East Prussia.    And even there they were almost worried to death. As they settled down  as peaceful citizens in this Protestant land of light and liberty, they  found, to their horror and dismay, that Lutherans, when it suited their  purpose, could be as bigoted as Catholics. They were forced to accept  the Confession of Augsburg. They were forbidden to ordain their own  priests or practise their own peculiar customs. They were treated,  not as Protestant brothers, but as highly suspicious foreigners; and a  priest of the Brethren was not allowed to visit a member of his flock  unless he took a Lutheran pastor with him. \"If you stay with us,\" said  Speratus, the Superintendent of the East Prussian Lutheran Church, \"you  must accommodate yourselves to our ways. Nobody sent for you; nobody  asked you to come.\" If the Brethren, in a word, were to stay in East  Prussia, they must cease to be Brethren at all, and allow themselves to  be absorbed by the conquering Lutherans of the land.    Meanwhile, however, they had a Moses to lead them out of the desert.  George Israel is a type of the ancient Brethren. He was the son of  a blacksmith, was a close friend of Augusta, had been with him at  Wittenberg, and was now the second great leader of the Brethren.  When Ferdinand issued his decree, Israel, like many of the Brethren's  Ministers, was summoned to Prague to answer for his faith and conduct  on pain of a fine of one thousand ducats; and when some of his friends  advised him to disobey the summons, and even offered to pay the money,  he gave one of those sublime answers which light up the gloom of the  time. \"No,\" he replied, \"I have been purchased once and for all with the  blood of Christ, and will not consent to be ransomed with the gold and  silver of my people. Keep what you have, for you will need it in your  flight, and pray for me that I may be steadfast in suffering for Jesus.\"  He went to Prague, confessed his faith, and was thrown into the White  Tower. But he was loosely guarded, and one day, disguised as a clerk,  with a pen behind his ear, and paper and ink-horn in his hand, he walked  out of the Tower in broad daylight through the midst of his guards,  and joined the Brethren in Prussia. He was just the man to guide the  wandering band, and the Council appointed him leader of the emigrants.  He was energetic and brave. He could speak the Polish tongue. He had a  clear head and strong limbs. For him a cold lodging in Prussia was  not enough. He would lead his Brethren to a better land, and give them  nobler work to do.    As the Brethren had already been driven from Poland, the task which  Israel now undertook appeared an act of folly. But George Israel knew  better. For a hundred years the people of Poland had sympathised to some  extent with the reforming movement in Bohemia. There Jerome of Prague  had taught. There the teaching of Hus had spread. There the people hated  the Church of Rome. There the nobles sent their sons to study under  Luther at Wittenberg. There the works of Luther and Calvin had been  printed and spread in secret. There, above all, the Queen herself had  been privately taught the Protestant faith by her own father-confessor.  And there, thought Israel, the Brethren in time would find a hearty  welcome. And so, while still retaining the oversight of a few parishes  in East Prussia, George Israel, by commission of the Council, set out  to conduct a mission in Poland {1551.}. Alone and on horseback, by bad  roads and swollen streams, he went on his dangerous journey; and on the  fourth Sunday in Lent arrived at the town of Thorn, and rested for the  day. Here occurred the famous incident on the ice which made his name  remembered in Thorn for many a year to come. As he was walking on the  frozen river to try whether the ice was strong enough to bear his horse,  the ice broke up with a crash. George Israel was left on a solitary  lump, and was swept whirling down the river; and then, as the ice blocks  cracked and banged and splintered into thousands of fragments, he sprang  like a deer from block to block, and sang with loud exulting voice:  \"Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all deeps; fire and  hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind fulfilling his word.\" There was a  great crowd on the bank. The people watched the thrilling sight with  awe, and when at last he reached firm ground they welcomed him with  shouts of joy. We marvel not that such a man was like the sword of  Gideon in the conflict. He rode on to Posen, the capital of Great  Poland, began holding secret meetings, and established the first  evangelical church in the country. The Roman"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21003"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Ely (#17)"],[1,"g, apparently  meant for the martyrdom of S. Edmund. A king naked above the middle,  except for his kingly crown, is tied to a tree and pierced by arrows;  archers with drawn bows are behind; at one end the king has his head,  still crowned, in his hands, with a figure bearing a sword over him; at  the other side is either the wolf of the legend or an evil spirit in  animal shape.    In the aisle itself are several memorials, mostly of the eighteenth  century, that call for no special mention. The latest is the brass to  Mr. Basevi, 1845.    At the east end of the aisle is the #Chapel Of Bishop Alcock# (d.  1500). The date, 1488, is fixed precisely by the inscribed stone now  placed in the wall above a small stone altar. The stone in the wall has  five crosses, as though intended for a chantry altar, but the slab of  the altar beneath has no crosses. The inscription is, \"Iohanes Alkoc  epus Eliesis hanc fabricam fieri fecit M cccc iiij(xx) viij.\" The sides  of the chapel are covered with niches, canopies, crockets, panels, and  devices. The roof has fan tracery with a massive pendant. A singular  little chantry is at the north, access to which is through a door at the  foot of the bishop's tomb. In a small window here is a little  contemporary stained glass. The bishop's rebus--a cock on a  globe--repeatedly occurs in the stone-work. The ornamentation strikes  the spectator as being excessive and too profuse. No figures have been  replaced in the niches.    In the retro-choir a mosaic slab over the remains of Bishop Allen (d.  1845) has a curious history. A son of the bishop was passing through  Paris soon after Napoleon's tomb was finished, and the surplus materials  were offered for sale by auction. Some of these were purchased by Mr.  Allen and utilised for the slab over the bishop's grave. The large  monument to Canon Mill (d. 1853) has an effigy in copper on a support of  marble and alabaster; students of India and Cambridge are by the feet.    The tomb of Cardinal Luxemburg (d. 1443) is beneath the most eastern  arch on the south, just north of Bishop West's chapel. When the monument  was concealed behind some wood-work great dispute arose as to the  headdress of the effigy. Bentham has an engraving with a cardinal's hat  on the archbishop's head. Cole records that it was a mitre. When the  wood-work was removed it was found that the figure was headless, as it  still remains.    [Illustration: THE EARLY ENGLISH PRESBYTERY AND THE SUPPOSED SHRINE OF  S. ETHELDREDA.]    Corresponding to the chapel of Bishop Alcock on the north is that of  #Bishop West# (d. 1533) in the south aisle. This is a most valuable  example of the Renaissance style. The niches and canopies with which the  walls are covered are much smaller than those in the other chapel, and  consequently more numerous; but by reason of the great delicacy of the  tracery and the wonderful variety of the designs there is no impression  that the decoration is overdone. No perfect specimen is left of the  statues or of the heads which were introduced in the tabernacle work;  and in its complete state this exquisite work can have existed for not  more, than twelve or thirteen years, as the Order in Council for  removing images was made in 1548. The roof is curious, as being an  adaptation in the Renaissance of the late Gothic fan tracery Some  colouring remains. The wrought-iron gates, with motto in Latin several  times repeated, and the curious little pendants from the roof,  consisting of angels bearing shields of arms, should be noticed. Bishops  Greene (d. 1738), Keene (d. 1781), Sparke (d. 1836), and Woodford (d.  1885) are all buried in this chapel. On the south side, within a  shrine-like receptacle, have been placed the relics of seven early  benefactors of the church. Originally buried in the Saxon church, they  have been several limes removed. They were placed here in 1771. The  names are carved in seven shallow niches. One was an archbishop, five  were bishops, and the seventh was Alderman Brithnoth. The dates range  from 991 to 1067.    The very interesting early Norman monumental slab, with carving in  relief, preserved in the aisle, does not strictly belong to the  cathedral, having been found at S. Mary's Church. Above a round-headed  canopy are some Norman buildings; in the chamfer of the canopy is an  invocation of the Archangel Michael, a figure of whom below has wings  and nimbus, and in the robe a portion of a naked figure with pastoral  staff beside it.    [Illustration: BISHOP ALCOCK'S CHAPEL.]    Proceeding westward, the monuments under the windows are those of Canon  Selwyn (d. 1875), Bishop Gunning (d. 1684), wearing a mitre, with long  hair and short beard, and Bishop Heton (d. 1609), in a cope and having  an ample beard. Under the arches of the presbytery, after the huge  tablet to Bishop Moore (d. 1714), are four monuments. The first is all  that is left of the tomb of Bishop Hotham (d. 1337). The next has  figures of John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, K.G., and his two wives. The  earl was beheaded in 1470, and is not interred here. One of the wives  was Cecily Neville, sister of Richard, Earl of Warwick, the King-maker.    Of the tomb of Bishop Barnet (d. 1373) the base only remains. It  resembles in general character the monument of Bishop Northwold.    [Illustration: BISHOP WEST'S CHAPEL.]    Under the last arch of the presbytery is the fine monument of Bishop  Louth (d. 1298). It is a very beautiful early Decorated composition.    Two brasses remain in the floor of the south aisle, both of great  interest. The famous brass of Bishop Goodrich (d. 1554) represents him  in full vestments (wearing a chasuble, not a cope), with mitre and  pastoral staff (see below, p. 124). This is specially noteworthy as he  was an enthusiastic supporter of the Reformation changes and is believed  to have encouraged, if he did not order the wholesale destruction of  statues and other ornamentation of the cathedral. He was Lord Chancellor  for three years, and the Great Seal is figured on the brass. Dean  Tyndall (d. 1614) is represented in a very different style. He is  figured in academical dress, wearing a ruff and a skull-cap, and with a  long beard. On one of the shields of arms may be seen the arms of the  Deanery impaling Tyndall.    Very many other tablets and inscriptions remain; but we have no space  for a more extended treatment of the subject. In the south transept is a  tablet to Dean Merivale (d. 1894), with a likeness in slight relief; and  mention of this gives opportunity for saying that the very greatest care  seems to have been taken to secure good likenesses in the most recent  monuments, those of three, as to which the writer can speak from  personal knowledge--Bishop Woodford, Dean Merivale, and Canon  Selwyn--being of conspicuous merit.    It would require a book to itself to treat exhaustively of the stained  glass in the windows. In nearly all cases, certainly in those which can  be examined without the aid of a glass, the names of the donors, or of  the persons to whose memory the windows were inserted, are plainly set  forth either in the windows or on brass tablets adjoining. It should be  stated that the greatest encouragement to this form of decoration was  given by Canon E. B. Sparke, who secured, partly by his influence and  persuasion, and largely by his own munificence, the insertion of so many  windows. It is true that in the first instance not a few were prepared  in too great a hurry, and some of those first placed in the restored  cathedral (as those in the octagon) have been at a later time condemned  as being deficient in harmony of colouring and in artistic design; but  there is little fault to be found with the most recent additions. Among  so many it is inevitable that very different degrees of merit will be  exhibited. It has been said that the entire series is an exemplification  of the Horatian maxim, \"Sunt bona, sunt quaedam mediocria, sunt mala  plura\"; and, except that we should be disposed to exchange the position  of the words \"quaedam\" and \"plura\" (if the metre allowed it), with this  sentiment we agree.
