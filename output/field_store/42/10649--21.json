There is a simple grandeur in the view of life with its powers of  growth, assimilation and reproduction, being originally breathed into  matter under one or a few forms, and that whilst this our planet has  gone circling on according to fixed laws, and land and water, in a cycle  of change, have gone on replacing each other, that from so simple an  origin, through the process of gradual selection of infinitesimal  changes, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been  evolved{184}.         {179} The simile of the savage and the ship occurs in the _Origin_,       Ed. i. p. 485, vi. p. 665.         {180} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 486, vi. p. 665, the author speaks       of the \"summing up of many contrivances\": I have therefore       introduced the above words which make the passage clearer. In the       _Origin_ the comparison is with \"a great mechanical       invention,\"--not with a work of art.         {181} See a similar passage in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 487, vi. p.       667.         {182} See the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 488, vi. p. 668.         {183} The following discussion, together with some memoranda are on       the last page of the MS. \"The supposed creative spirit does not       create either number or kind which <are> from analogy adapted to site       (viz. New Zealand): it does not keep them all permanently adapted       to any country,--it works on spots or areas of creation,--it is not       persistent for great periods,--it creates forms of same groups in       same regions, with no physical similarity,--it creates, on islands       or mountain summits, species allied to the neighbouring ones, and       not allied to alpine nature as shown in other mountain       summits--even different on different island of similarly       constituted archipelago, not created on two points: never mammifers       created on small isolated island; nor number of organisms adapted       to locality: its power seems influenced or related to the range of       other species wholly distinct of the same genus,--it does not       equally effect, in amount of difference, all the groups of the same       class.\"         {184} This passage is the ancestor of the concluding words in the       first edition of the _Origin of Species_ which have remained       substantially unchanged throughout subsequent editions, \"There is       grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been       originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that whilst       this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of       gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful       and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\" In the 2nd       edition \"by the Creator\" is introduced after \"originally breathed.\"    N.B.--There ought somewhere to be a discussion from Lyell to show that  external conditions do vary, or a note to Lyell's works <work?>.    Besides other difficulties in ii. Part, non-acclimatisation of plants.  Difficulty when asked _how_ did white and negro become altered from  common intermediate stock: no facts. We do NOT know that species are  immutable, on the contrary. What arguments against this theory, except  our not perceiving every step, like the erosion of valleys{185}.         {185} Compare the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 481, vi. p. 659, \"The       difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when       Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been       formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the       coast-waves.\"          THE ESSAY OF 1844 PART I          CHAPTER I    ON THE VARIATION OF ORGANIC BEINGS UNDER DOMESTICATION; AND ON THE  PRINCIPLES OF SELECTION      The most favourable conditions for variation seem to be when organic  beings are bred for many generations under domestication{186}: one may  infer this from the simple fact of the vast number of races and breeds  of almost every plant and animal, which has long been domesticated.  Under certain conditions organic beings even during their individual  lives become slightly altered from their usual form, size, or other  characters: and many of the peculiarities thus acquired are transmitted  to their offspring. Thus in animals, the size and vigour of body,  fatness, period of maturity, habits of body or consensual movements,  habits of mind and temper, are modified or acquired during the life of  the individual{187}, and become inherited. There is reason to believe  that when long exercise has given to certain muscles great development,  or disuse has lessened them, that such development is also inherited.  Food and climate will occasionally produce changes in the colour and  texture of the external coverings of animals; and certain unknown  conditions affect the horns of cattle in parts of Abyssinia; but whether  these peculiarities, thus acquired during individual lives, have been  inherited, I do not know. It appears certain that malconformation and  lameness in horses, produced by too much work on hard roads,--that  affections of the eyes in this animal probably caused by bad  ventilation,--that tendencies towards many diseases in man, such as  gout, caused by the course of life and ultimately producing changes of  structure, and that many other diseases produced by unknown agencies,  such as goitre, and the idiotcy resulting from it, all become  hereditary.         {186} The cumulative effect of domestication is insisted on in the       _Origin_, see _e.g. Origin_, Ed. i. p. 7, vi. p. 8.         {187} This type of variation passes into what he describes as the       direct effect of conditions. Since they are due to causes acting       during the adult life of the organism they might be called       individual variations, but he uses this term for congenital       variations, _e.g._ the differences discoverable in plants raised       from seeds of the same pod _(Origin_, Ed. i. p. 45, vi. p. 53).    It is very doubtful whether the flowers and leaf-buds, annually produced  from the same bulb, root, or tree, can properly be considered as parts  of the same individual, though in some respects they certainly seem to  be so. If they are parts of an individual, plants also are subject to  considerable changes during their _individual_ lives. Most  florist-flowers if neglected degenerate, that is, they lose some of  their characters; so common is this, that trueness is often stated, as  greatly enhancing the value of a variety{188}: tulips break their  colours only after some years' culture; some plants become double and  others single, by neglect or care: these characters can be transmitted  by cuttings or grafts, and in some cases by true or seminal propagation.  Occasionally a single bud on a plant assumes at once a new and widely  different character: thus it is certain that nectarines have been  produced on peach trees and moss roses on provence roses; white  currants on red currant bushes; flowers of a different colour from that  of the stock, in Chrysanthemums, Dahlias, sweet-williams, Azaleas, &c.,  &c.; variegated leaf-buds on many trees, and other similar cases. These  new characters appearing in single buds, can, like those lesser changes  affecting the whole plant, be multiplied not only by cuttings and such  means, but often likewise by true seminal generation.         {188} <It is not clear where the following note is meant to come>:       Case of Orchis,--most remarkable as not long cultivated by       seminal propagation. Case of varieties which soon acquire, like       _AEgilops_ and Carrot (and Maize) _a certain general character_ and       then go on varying.    The changes thus appearing during the lives of individual animals and  plants are extremely rare compared with those which are congenital or  which appear soon after birth. Slight differences thus arising are  infinitely numerous: the proportions and form of every part of the  frame, inside and outside, appear to vary in very slight degrees:  anatomists dispute what is the \"beau ideal\" of the bones, the liver and  kidneys, like painters do of the proportions of the face: the proverbial  expression that no two animals or plants are born absolutely alike, is  much truer when applied to those under domestication, than to those in a  state of nature{189}. Besides these slight differences, single  individuals are occasionally born considerably unlike in certain parts  or in their whole structure to their parents: these are called by  horticulturists and breeders \"sports\"; and are not uncommon except when  very strongly marked. Such sports are known in some cases to have been  parents of some of our domestic races; and such probably have been the  parents of many other races, especially of those which in some senses  may be called hereditary monsters; for instance where there is an  additional limb, or where all the limbs are stunted (as in the Ancon  sheep), or where a part is wanting, as in rumpless fowls and tailless  dogs or cats{190}. The effects of external conditions on the size,  colour and form, which can rarely and obscurely be detected during one  individual life, become apparent after several generations: the slight  differences, often hardly describable, which characterize the stock of  different countries, and even of districts in the same country, seem to  be due to such continued action.         {189} Here, as in the MS. of 1842, the author is inclined to       minimise the variation occurring in nature.         {190} This is more strongly stated than in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.       30.      _On the hereditary tendency._    A volume might be filled with facts showing what a strong tendency there  is to inheritance, in almost every case of the most trifling, as well as  of the most remarkable congenital"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2273"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat; Or, The Rivals of Lake Carlopa (#17)"],[1,"it to fix.  But you can go ahead now if you wish.\"    \"Thank you.  It just shows how ignorant I am of machinery.  I presume  something will go wrong in another mile or two.  But may I ask what you  are doing here?  I presume you are in your motor-boat, sailing about  for pleasure.  And didn't I understand you to say you were after those  chaps again?  Bless my watch charm, but I was so interested in my  machine that I didn't think to ask you.\"    \"Yes, I am after those thieves again.\"    \"In your motor-boat, I presume.  Well, I hope you catch them.  What  have they stolen now?\"    \"My motor-boat.  That's why I'm after them, but I had to borrow a craft  to chase them with.\"    \"Bless my soul!  You don't tell me!  How did it happen?\"    Thereupon the lad related as much of the story as was necessary to put  Mr. Damon in possession of the facts and he ended up with:    \"I don't suppose you have seen anything of the men in my boat, have  you?\"    Mr. Damon seemed strangely excited.  He had entered his auto, but as  the lad's story progressed the odd gentleman had descended.  When Tom  finished he exclaimed:    \"Don't say a word now--not a word.  I want to think, and that is a  process, which, for me, requires a little time.  Don't speak a word  now.  Bless my left hand, but I think I can help you!\"    He frowned, stamped first one foot, then the other, looked up at the  sky, as if seeking inspiration there, and then down at the ground, as  if that would help him to think.  Then he clapped his hands smartly  together and cried out:    \"Bless my shoe buttons!\"    \"Have you seen them?\" asked Tom eagerly.    \"Was your boat one with a red arrow painted on the bow?\" asked Mr.  Damon in turn.    \"It was!\" and the lad was now almost as excited as was his friend.    \"Then I've seen it and, what's more, this morning!  Bless my spark  plug, I've seen it!\"    \"Tell me about it!\" pleaded the young inventor, and Mr. Damon, calming  himself after an effort, resumed:    \"I was out for an early spin in my auto,\" he said, \"and was traveling  along a road that bordered the lake, about fifteen miles above here.  I  heard a motor-boat puffing along near shore, and, looking through the  trees, I saw one containing three men.  It had a red arrow on the bow,  and that's why I noticed it, because I recalled that your boat was  named the DART.\"    \"ARROW,\" corrected Tom.    \"The ARROW.  Oh, yes, I knew it was something like that.  Well of  course at the time I didn't think that it was your boat, but I  associated it in my mind with yours.  Do you catch my meaning?\"    Tom did and said so, wishing Mr. Damon would hurry and get to the  point.  But the eccentric character had to do things in his own way.    \"Exactly,\" he resumed. \"Well, I didn't think that was your boat, but,  at the same time, I watched the men out of curiosity, and I was struck  with their behavior. They seemed to be quarreling, and, from what I  could hear, two of them seemed to be remonstrating with the third one  for having taken some sort of a piece of wood from the forward  compartment. I believe that is the proper term.\"    \"Yes!\" Tom almost shouted.  \"But where did they go?  What became of  them?  What was the man doing to the forward compartment--where the  gasoline tank is?\"    \"Exactly.  I was trying to think what was kept there.  That's it, the  gasoline tank.  Well, the boat kept on up the lake, and I don't know  what became of the men.  But about that piece of wood.  It seems that  one of the men removed a block, from under the tank and the others  objected.  That's why they were quarreling.\"    \"That's very strange,\" exclaimed the lad.  \"There must be some mystery  about my boat that I don't understand.  But that will keep until I get  the boat itself.  Good-by, Mr. Damon.  I must be off.\"    \"Where to?\"    \"Up the lake after those thieves.  I must lose no time,\" and Tom  started to go back to where he had left the RED STREAK.    \"Hold on!\" cried Mr. Damon.  \"I have something to propose, Tom.  Two  heads are better than one, even if one doesn't know how to adjust a  nutmeg grate.  Suppose I come along with you?  I can point out the  direction the men took, at any rate.\"    \"I'll be very glad to have you,\" answered the lad, who felt that he  might need help if there were three of the thieves in his craft.  \"But  what will you do with your automobile?\"    \"I'll just run it down the road a way to where a friend of mine has a  stable.  I'll leave it in there and join you.  Will you let me come?  Bless my eye glasses, but I'd like to help catch those scoundrels!\"    \"I'll be very glad to have you.  Go ahead, put the auto in the barn and  I'll wait for you.\"    \"I have a better plan than that,\" replied Mr. Damon.  \"Run your boat  down to that point,\" and he indicated one about a mile up the lake.  \"I'll be there waiting for you, and we'll lose no time.  I can cover  the ground faster in my auto than you can in your boat.\"    Tom saw the advantage of this and was soon under way, while he heard on  shore the puffing of his friend's car.  On the trip to the point Tom  puzzled over the strange actions of the man in taking one of the braces  from under the gasoline tank.    \"I'll wager he did it before,\" thought the lad.  \"It must be the same  person who was tampering with the lock of the forward compartment the  day I bought the boat.  But why--that's the question--why?\"    He could find no answer to this, puzzle over it as he did, and he gave  it up.  His whole desire now was to get on the trail of the thieves,  and he had strong hopes, after the clew Mr. Damon had given him.  The  latter was waiting for him on the point, and so nimble was the owner of  the auto, in spite of his size, that Tom was not delayed more than the  fraction of a minute ere he was under way again, speeding up the lake.    \"Now keep well in toward shore,\" advised Mr. Damon.  \"Those fellows  don't want to be observed any more than they can help, and they'll  sneak along the bank, They were headed in that direction,\" and he  pointed it out.  \"Now I hope you won't think I'm in the way.  Besides,  you know, if you get your boat back, you'll want some one to help steer  it, while you run this one.  I can do that, at all events, bless my  very existence!\"    \"I am very glad of your help,\" replied the lad, but he did not take his  eyes from the water before him, and he was looking for a sight of his  boat with the men in it.    For three hours or more Tom and Mr. Damon cruised in and out along the  shore of the lake, going farther and farther up the body of water.  Tom  was beginning to think that he would reach Sandport without catching  sight of the thieves, and he was wondering if, after all, he might not  better stop off and see his father when, above the puffing of the motor  in the RED STREAK, he heard the put-put of another boat.    \"Listen!\" cried Mr. Damon, who had heard it at the same time.    Tom nodded.    \"They're just ahead of us,\" whispered his companion.    \"If it's them,\" was the lad's reply.    \"Speed up and we'll soon see,\" suggested Mr. Damon, and Tom shoved the  timer over.  The RED STREAK forged ahead.  The sound of the other boat  came more plainly now.  It was beyond a little point of land.  The  young inventor steered out to get around it and leaned eagerly forward  to catch the first glimpse of the unseen craft.  Would it prove to be  the ARROW?    The put-put became louder now.  Mr. Damon was standing up, as if that  would, in some mysterious way, help.  Then suddenly the other boat came  into view.  Tom saw it in an instant and knew it for the ARROW.    \"There she is!\" he cried.          CHAPTER XVIII    THE PURSUIT      For an instant after Tom's exultant cry the men in the boat ahead were  not aware that they were being pursued.  Then, as the explosions from  the motor of the RED STREAK sounded over the water, they turned to see  who was coming up behind them.  There was no mistaking the attitude of  the young inventor and his companion.  They were leaning eagerly  forward, as if they could reach out and grasp the criminals who were  fleeing before them.    \"Put on all the speed you can, Tom!\" begged Mr. Damon.  \"We'll catch  the scoundrels now.  Speed up the motor!  Oh, if I only had my  automobile now.  Bless my crank shaft, but one can go so much faster on  land than on water.\"    The lad did not reply, but thought, with grim humor, that running an  automobile over Lake Carlopa would be no small feat.  Mr. Damon,  however, knew what he was saying.    \"We'll catch them!  We'll nab 'em!\" he cried.  \"Speed her up, Tom.\"    The youth was doing his best with the motor of the RED STREAK.  He was  not as well acquainted with it as he was with the one in his boat, but  he knew, even better than Andy Foger, how to make it do efficient work.  It was a foregone conclusion that the RED STREAK, if rightly handled,  could beat the ARROW, but there were several points in favor of the  thieves.  The motor of Tom's boat was in perfect order, and even an  amateur, with some knowledge of a boat, could make it do nearly its  best.  On the other hand, the RED STREAK's machinery needed \"nursing.\"  Again, the thieves had a good start, and that counted for much.  But  Tom counted on two other points.  One was that Happy Harry and his gang  would probably know little about the fine points of a motor.  They had  shown this in letting the motor of the boat they had first stolen get  out of order, and Tom knew the ins and outs of a gasoline engine to  perfection.  So the chase was not so hopeless as it seemed.    \"Do you think you can catch them?\" asked Mr. Damon anxiously.    \"I'm going to make a big try,\" answered his companion.    \"They're heading out into the middle of the lake!\" cried the eccentric  man.    \"If they do, I can cut them off!\" murmured Tom as he put the wheel over.    But whoever was steering the ARROW knew better than to send it on a  course that would enable the pursuing"]]]
