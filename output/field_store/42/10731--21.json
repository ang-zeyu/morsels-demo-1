Men  shattered and dying were there; others, more fortunate, wetted their  lips and eased their way to God.    Poor Claud and Bill arrived, senseless, almost lifeless.  But kind  hands staunched their wounds, allayed their thirst, and carried them on  board the ship for Alexandria.  There they found the first taste of  that gentle peace which is soothing to the heart of every nerve-racked  soldier.  Nourishment soon brought them round.  And, strange to say,  both returned from the land of wanderings to the delights of reality at  the same time.    \"Bill!  Bill!\" muttered Claud as he came round.  \"I'm here, ole sport,\"  said Bill, holding out his pale, wan hand.    \"Good!  But where's Paddy?\"    \"Sure, an ould Paddy's here,\" roared Doolan from a berth on the other  side of the deck.    \"Thank God!\"  And Claud tumbled into a more natural sleep, refreshed  with the thought that at least two out of his three friends still lived.    Sips of brandy, drops of milk, clean bandages, and willing Australian  nurses soon brought the genial three round to a more normal state.  And  in speaking of Australian nurses, let me say that they are the finest  girls in the hospital world.  They may laugh, they may flirt, but they  can work.  They have no side and no false airs.  They want to do their  job in the quickest, kindest, quietest way that can be found.          *      *      *      *      *    The great ship slipped through the breakwater of Alexandria.  Hundreds  awaited her coming--nurses, doctors, and friends.  Bill and Claud could  not get up to view the scene.  But Paddy watched it all.  His eyes  scanned the faces on shore.  At last they rested on a familiar  figure--a girl with a beautiful form, a charming but an anxious face.  Yes, it was Sybil Graham.  He slipped down to the ward below and  stepped to Claud's bed.    \"I've seen her, and doesn't she look swate?\"    \"Who?\" said Claud in a knowing way.    \"Sybil, ye fathead!  And, mind ye, mine's a kiss for bringing the news.\"    \"Right, old chap; and I'll see that you get it,\" said the now excited  owner of this Australian girl's heart.    The boat was now alongside.  Ropes were down and fixed.  The shore  gangway was up, and, in response to the somewhat wild and frantic  shouts and grins of Paddy Doolan, Sybil Graham dashed up the steps  three at a time.    \"Oh, Paddy!\" she said, with tears in her eyes.  \"Where is he?\"    \"This way, ye darlint.\"  And down into the ward leaped the now madly  excited Irishman.  Sybil followed.  As she reached the foot of the  stairs she saw her lover.  Nurses, doctors, and patients were then  startled with a shriek of delight from a beautiful vision who pounced  to a bed and smothered her hero with kisses.  Bill and Paddy watched it  all.    \"Say, Miss Sybil, where do I come in?\" said Bill with a sort of  well-feigned growl.    \"Surely!  There's _one_ for you, you dear, dear old bushman,\" she said,  kissing his black-bearded lips.    \"Here, Sybil, isn't it Paddy's turn now?  He brought the news of you.\"    \"Oh, you lovable Irish rogue--you're worth the kissing--you helped my  boy to safety too.\"  And so Paddy received his dues.    \"And now, miss,\" said a smiling nurse, \"we're going to take those three  lovers of yours to hospital in Cairo.\"    \"How mean of you,\" said Sybil with a smile.  \"Of course, you can't  prevent me from seeing them there?\"    \"Certainly not, my girl.  That will be the biggest part of their cure.\"    \"Oh, by the way, I've news for you, boys,\" said Sybil, turning again:    \"Bill, you've got the V.C.\"    \"Paddy, you've got the V.C.\"    \"Claud, you've got a commission.\"    \"And you--eh?\" smiled Claud.    \"Well--yes.\"    \"And very nice too,\" whispered a doctor into the nurse's ear as the  very happy girl went out.          CHAPTER XI    WHAT LADY READERS LIKE    (_Extract from Cairo Press_)    \"At Shepheard's Hotel, Cairo, Lieutenant Claud Dufair, eldest son of  Lord Dufair, to Sybil Graham, daughter of \"Bob\" Graham, of New South  Wales.

Raw furrows showed in the  woodwork, one mule was missing and the driver and guard wore fresh  bandages. A tired tenderfoot leaped out with a sigh of relief and hunted  for his baggage, which he found to be generously perforated. Swearing  at the God-forsaken land where a man had to fight highwaymen and  Indians inside of half a day he grumblingly lugged his valise toward a  forbidding-looking shack which was called a hotel.    The driver released his teams and then turned to Red. \"Hullo, old hoss,  how's th' gang?\" he asked genially. \"We've had a heck of a time this  yere trip,\" he went on without waiting for Red to reply. \"Five miles out  of Las Cruces we stood off a son-of-a-gun that wanted th' dude's wealth.  Then just this side of the San Andre foothills we runs into a bunch of  young bucks who turned us off this yere way an' gave us a runnin' fight  purty near all th' way. I'm a whole lot farther from Paso now than I  was when I started, an seem as I lost a jack I'll be some time gittin'  there. Yu don't happen to sabe a jack I can borrow, do yu?\"    \"I don't know about no jack, but I'll rope yu a bronch,\" offered Red,  winking at Johnny.    \"I'll pull her myself before I'll put dynamite in di' traces,\" replied  the driver. \"Yu fellers might amble back a ways with me--them buddin'  warriors'll be layin' for me.\"    \"We shore will,\" responded Johnny eagerly. \"There's nine of us now an'  there'll be nine more an' a cook to-morrow, mebby.\"    \"Gosh, yu grows some,\" replied the guard. \"Eighteen'll be a plenty for  them glory hunters.\"    \"We won't be able to,\" contradicted Red, \"for things are peculiar.\"    At this moment the conversation was interrupted by the tenderfoot, who  sported a new and cheap sombrero and also a belt and holster complete.    \"Will you gentlemen join me?\" He asked, turning to Red and nodding at  the saloon. \"I am very dry and much averse to drinking alone.\"    \"Why, shore,\" responded Red heartily, wishing to put the stranger at  ease.    The game was running about even as they entered and Lefty Allen was  singing \"The Insult,\" the rich tenor softening the harshness of the  surroundings.         I've swum th' Colorado where she's almost lost to view, I've braced          th' Jaro layouts in Cheyenne;       I've fought for muddy water with a howlin' bunch of Sioux, An'          swallowed hot tamales, an' cayenne.       I've rid a pitchin' broncho 'till th' sky was underneath, I've          tackled every desert in th' land;       I've sampled XXXX whiskey 'till I couldn't hardly see, An' dallied          with th' quicksands of the Grande.       I've argued with th' marshals of a half-a-dozen burgs, I've been          dragged free an' fancy by a cow;       I've had three years' campaignin' with th' fightin', bitin' Ninth,          An' never lost my temper 'till right now.       I've had the yaller fever an I've been shot full of holes, I've          grabbed an army mule plumb by its tail;       I've never been so snortin', really highfalutin' mad As when y'u up          an' hands me ginger ale!    Hopalong laughed joyously at a remark made by Waffles and the stranger  glanced quickly at him. His merry, boyish face, underlined by a  jaw showing great firmness and set with an expression of aggressive  self-reliance, impressed the stranger and he remarked to Red, who  lounged lazily near him, that he was surprised to see such a face on so  young a man and he asked who the player was.    \"Oh, his name's Hopalong Cassidy,\" answered Red. \"He's di' cuss that  raised that ruction down in Mexico last spring. Rode his cayuse in a  saloon and played with the loungers and had to shoot one before he got  out. When he did get out he had to fight a whole bunch of Mexicans an'  even potted their marshal, who had di' drop on him. Then he returned and  visited the marshal about a month later, took his gun away from him  an' then cut th' cards to see if he was a prisoner or not. He's a shore  funny cuss.\"    The tenderfoot gasped his amazement. \"Are you not fooling with me?\" He  asked.    \"Tell him yu came after that five hundred dollars reward and see,\"  answered Red goodnaturedly.    \"Holy smoke!\" shouted Waffles as Hopalong won his sixth consecutive pot.  \"Did yu ever see such luck?\" Frenchy grinned and some time later raked  in his third. Salvation then staked his last cent against Hopalong's  flush and dropped out.    Tenspot flipped to Waffles the money he had been juggling and Lefty  searched his clothes for wealth. Buck, still leaning against the bar,  grinned and winked at Johnny, who was pouring hair-raising tales into  the receptive ears of the stranger. Thereupon Johnny confided to his  newly found acquaintance the facts about the game, nearly causing that  person to explode with delight.    Waffles pushed back his chair, stood up and stretched. At the finish  of a yawn he grinned at his late adversary. \"I'm all in, yu old  son-of-a-gun. Yu shore can play draw. I'm goin' to try yu again some  time. I was beat fair an' square an' I ain't got no kick comin', none  whatever,\" he remarked, as he shook hands with Hopalong.    \"Oh, we're that gang from th' O-Bar-O,\" hummed the Kid as he sauntered  in. One cheek was slightly swollen and his clothes shed dust at every  step. \"Who wins?\" he inquired, not having heard Waffles.    \"They did, blast it!\" exploded Bigfoot.    One of the Kid's peculiarities was revealed in the unreasoning and  hasty conclusions he arrived at. From no desire to imply unfairness,  but rather because of his bitterness against failure of any kind and his  loyalty to Waffles, came his next words:    \"Mebby they skinned yu.\"    Like a flash Waffles sprang before him, his hand held up, palm out. \"He  don't mean nothin'--he's only a ignorant kid!\" he cried.    Buck smiled and wrested the Colt from Johnny's ever-ready hand. \"Here's  another,\" he said. Red laughed softly and rolled Johnny on the floor.  \"Yu jackass,\" he whispered, \"don't yu know better'n to make a gun-play  when we needs them all?\"    \"What are we goin' to do?\" Asked Tex, glancing at the bulging pockets of  Hopalong's chaps.    \"We're goin' to punch cows again, that's what we're to do,\" answered  Bigfoot dismally.    \"An' whose are we goin' to punch? We can't go back to the old man,\"  grumbled Tex.    Salvation looked askance at Buck and then at the others. \"Mebby,\" he  began, \"Mebby we kin git a job on th' Bar-20.\" Then turning to Buck  again he bluntly asked, \"Are yu short of punchers?\"    \"Well, I might use some,\" answered the foreman, hesitating. \"But   I ain't got only one cook, an'----\"    \"We'll git yu th' cook all O.K.,\" interrupted Charley Lane vehemently.  \"Hi, yu cook!\" he shouted, \"amble in here an' git a rustle on!\"    There was no reply, and after waiting for a minute he and Waffles went  into the rear room, from which there immediately issued great chunks  of profanity and noise. They returned looking pugnacious and disgusted,  with a wildly fighting man who was more full of liquor than was the  bottle which he belligerently waved.    \"This here animated distillery what yu sees is our cook,\" said Waffles.  \"We eats his grub, nobody else. If he gits drunk that's our funeral; but  he won't get drunk! If yu wants us to punch for yu say so an' we does;  if yu don't, we don't.\"    \"Well,\" replied Buck thoughtfully, \"mebby I can use yu.\" Then with a  burst of recklessness he added, \"Yes, if I lose my job! But yu might  sober that Mexican up if yu let him fall in th' horse trough.\"    As the procession wended its way on its mission of wet charity, carrying  the cook in any manner at all, Frenchy waved his long lost sombrero  at Buck, who stood in the door, and shouted, \"Yu old son-of-a-gun, I'm  proud to know yu!\"    Buck smiled and snapped his watch shut \"Time to amble,\" he said.        CHAPTER XI. Holding the Claim      \"Oh, we're that gang from th' O-Bar-O,\" hummed Waffles, sinking the  branding-iron in the flank of a calf. The scene was one of great  activity and hilarity. Several fires were burning near the huge corral  and in them half a dozen irons were getting hot. Three calves were being  held down for the brand of the \"Bar-20\" and two more were being dragged  up on their sides by the ropes of the cowboys, the proud cow-ponies  showing off their accomplishments at the expense of the calves'  feelings. In the corral the dust arose in steady clouds as calf after  calf was \"cut out\" by the ropers and dragged out to get \"tagged.\" Angry  cows fought valiantly for their terrorized offspring, but always to no  avail, for the hated rope of some perspiring and dust-grimed rider sent  them crashing to earth. Over the plain were herds of cattle and groups  of madly riding cowboys, and two cook wagons were stalled a short  distance from the corral. The round-up of the Bar-20 was taking place,  and each of the two outfits tried to outdo the other and each individual  strove for a prize. The man who cut out and dragged to the fire the most  calves in three days could leave for the Black Hills at the expiration  of that time, the rest to follow as soon as they could.    In this contest Hopalong Cassidy led his nearest rival, Red Connors,  both of whom were Bar-20 men, by twenty cut-outs, and there remained but  half an hour more in which to compete. As Red disappeared into the sea  of tossing horns Hopalong dashed out with a whoop.     \"Hi, yu trellis-built rack of bones, come along there! Whoop!\" he  yelled, turning the prisoner over to the squad by the fire.    \"Chalk up this here insignificant wart of cross-eyed perversity: an' how  many?\" He called as he galloped back to the corral.    \"One ninety-eight,\" announced Buck, blowing the sand from the tally  sheet. \"That's shore goin' some,\" he remarked to himself.    When the calf sprang up it was filled with terror, rage and pain, and  charged at Billy from the rear as that pessimistic soul was leaning over  and poking his "]]]
