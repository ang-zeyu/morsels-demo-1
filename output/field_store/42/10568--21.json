[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#17)"],[1," born many times.  And my first self-birth happened, as I have told, that spring day of  my early springs. Therefore would I plant a rose on the green bank of  the Polota, there to bloom in token of eternal life.    Eternal, divine life. This is a tale of immortal life. Should I be  sitting here, chattering of my infantile adventures, if I did not know  that I was speaking for thousands? Should you be sitting there,  attending to my chatter, while the world's work waits, if you did not  know that I spoke also for you? I might say \"you\" or \"he\" instead of  \"I.\" Or I might be silent, while you spoke for me and the rest, but  for the accident that I was born with a pen in my hand, and you  without. We love to read the lives of the great, yet what a broken  history of mankind they give, unless supplemented by the lives of the  humble. But while the great can speak for themselves, or by the  tongues of their admirers, the humble are apt to live inarticulate and  die unheard. It is well that now and then one is born among the simple  with a taste for self-revelation. The man or woman thus endowed must  speak, will speak, though there are only the grasses in the field to  hear, and none but the wind to carry the tale.           *       *       *       *       *    It is fun to run over the bridge, with a clatter of stout little shoes  on resounding timbers. We pass a walled orchard on the right, and  remind each other of the fruit we enjoyed here last summer. Our next  stopping-place is farther on, beyond the wayside inn where lives the  idiot boy who gave me such a scare last time. It is a poor enough  place, where we stop, but there is an ice house, the only one I know.  We are allowed to go in and see the greenish masses of ice gleaming in  the half-light, and bring out jars of sweet, black \"lager beer,\" which  we drink in the sunny doorway. I shall always remember the flavor of  the stuff, and the smell, and the wonder and chill of the ice house.    I vaguely remember something about a convent out in that direction,  but I was tired and sleepy after my long walk, and glad to be  returning home. I hope they carried me a bit of the way, for I was  very tired. There were stars out before we reached home, and the men  stopped in the middle of the street to bless the new moon.    It is pleasant to recall how we went bathing in the Polota. On Friday  afternoons in summer, when the week's work was done, and the houses of  the good housewives stood shining with cleanliness, ready for the  Sabbath, parties of women and girls went chattering and laughing down  to the river bank. There was a particular spot which belonged to the  women. I do not know where the men bathed, but our part of the river  was just above Bonderoff's gristmill. I can see the green bank sloping  to the water, and the still water sliding down to the sudden swirl and  spray of the mill race.    The woods on the bank screened the bathers. Bathing costumes were  simply absent, which caused the mermaids no embarrassment, for they  were accustomed to see each other naked in the public hot baths. They  had little fear of intrusion, for the spot was sacred to them. They  splashed about and laughed and played tricks, with streaming hair and  free gestures. I do not know when I saw the girls play as they did in  the water. It was a pretty picture, but the bathers would have been  shocked beyond your understanding if you had suggested that naked  women might be put into a picture. If it ever happened, as it happened  at least once for me to remember, that their privacy was outraged, the  bathers were thrown into a panic as if their very lives were  threatened. Screaming, they huddled together, low in the water, some  hiding their eyes in their hands, with the instinct of the ostrich.  Some ran for their clothes on the bank, and stood shrinking behind  some inadequate rag. The more spirited of the naiads threw pebbles at  the cowardly intruders, who, safe behind the leafy cover that was  meant to shield modesty, threw jeers and mockery in return. But the  Gentile boys ran away soon, or ran away punished. A chemise and a  petticoat turn a frightened woman into an Amazon in such  circumstances; and woe to the impudent wretch who lingered after the  avengers plunged into the thicket. Slaps and cuffs at close range were  his portion, and curses pursued him in retreat.    Among the liveliest of my memories are those of eating and drinking;  and I would sooner give up some of my delightful remembered walks,  green trees, cool skies, and all, than to lose my images of suppers  eaten on Sabbath evenings at the end of those walks. I make no apology  to the spiritually minded, to whom this statement must be a revelation  of grossness. I am content to tell the truth as well as I am able. I  do not even need to console myself with the reflection that what is  dross to the dreamy ascetic may be gold to the psychologist. The fact  is that I ate, even as a delicate child, with considerable relish; and  I remember eating with a relish still keener. Why, I can dream away a  half-hour on the immortal flavor of those thick cheese cakes we used  to have on Saturday night. I am no cook, so I cannot tell you how to  make such cake. I might borrow the recipe from my mother, but I would  rather you should take my word for the excellence of Polotzk cheese  cakes. If you should attempt that pastry, I am certain, be you ever so  clever a cook, you would be disappointed by the result; and hence you  might be led to mistrust my reflections and conclusions. You have  nothing in your kitchen cupboard to give the pastry its notable  flavor. It takes history to make such a cake. First, you must eat it  as a ravenous child, in memorable twilights, before the lighting of  the week-day lamp. Then you must have yourself removed from the house  of your simple feast, across the oceans, to a land where your  cherished pastry is unknown even by name; and where daylight and  twilight, work day and fete day, for years rush by you in the unbroken  tide of a strange, new, overfull life. You must abstain from the  inimitable morsel for a period of years,--I think fifteen is the magic  number,--and then suddenly, one day, rub the Aladdin's lamp of memory,  and have the renowned tidbit whisked upon your platter, garnished with  a hundred sweet herbs of past association.    Do you think all your imported spices, all your scientific blending  and manipulating, could produce so fragrant a morsel as that which I  have on my tongue as I write? Glad am I that my mother, in her  assiduous imitation of everything American, has forgotten the secrets  of Polotzk cookery. At any rate, she does not practise it, and I am  the richer in memories for her omissions. Polotzk cheese cake, as I  now know it, has in it the flavor of daisies and clover picked on the  Vall; the sweetness of Dvina water; the richness of newly turned earth  which I moulded with bare feet and hands; the ripeness of red cherries  bought by the dipperful in the market place; the fragrance of all my  childhood's summers.    Abstinence, as I have mentioned, is one of the essential ingredients  in the phantom dish. I discovered this through a recent experience. It  was cherry time in the country, and the sight of the scarlet fruit  suddenly reminded me of a cherry season in Polotzk, I could not say  how many years ago. On that earlier occasion my Cousin Shimke, who,  like everybody else, was a storekeeper, had set a boy to watch her  store, and me to watch the boy, while she went home to make cherry  preserves. She gave us a basket of cherries for our trouble, and the  boy offered to eat them with the stones if I would give him my share.  But I was equal to that feat myself, so we sat down to a cherry-stone  contest. Who ate the most stones I could not remember as I stood under  the laden trees not long ago, but the transcendent flavor of the  historical cherries came back to me, and I needs must enjoy it once  more.    I climbed into the lowest boughs and hung there, eating cherries with  the stones, my whole mind concentrated on the sense of taste. Alas!  the fruit had no such flavor to yield as I sought. Excellent American  cherries were these, but not so fragrantly sweet as my cousin's  cherries. And if I should return to Polotzk, and buy me a measure of  cherries at a market stall, and pay for it with a Russian groschen,  would the market woman be generous enough to throw in that haunting  flavor? I fear I should find that the old species of cherry is extinct  in Polotzk.    Sometimes, when I am not trying to remember at all, I am more  fortunate in extracting the flavors of past feasts from my plain  American viands. I was eating strawberries the other day, ripe, red  American strawberries. Suddenly I experienced the very flavor and  aroma of some strawberries I ate perhaps twenty years ago. I started  as from a shock, and then sat still for I do not know how long,  breathless with amazement. In the brief interval of a gustatory  perception I became a child again, and I positively ached with the  pain of being so suddenly compressed to that small being. I wandered  about Polotzk once more, with large, questioning eyes; I rode the  Atlantic in an emigrant ship; I took possession of the New World, my  ears growing accustomed to a new language; I sat at the feet of  renowned professors, till my eyes contracted in dreaming over what  they taught; and there I was again, an American among Americans,  suddenly made aware of all that I had been, all that I had  become--suddenly illuminated, inspired by a complete vision of myself,  a daughter of Israel and a child of the universe, that taught me more  of the history of my race than ever my learned teachers could  understand.    All this came to me in that instant of tasting, all from the flavor of  ripe strawberries on my tongue. Why, then, should I not treasure my  memories of childhood feasts? This"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#17)"],[1,"a claim on an estate; superficially it was  an affair for the English and French lawyers. To read into this that the  people were sheep bought and sold is to misunderstand all mediaeval  history; sheep have no trade union. The English arms owed much of their  force to the class of the free yeomen; and the success of the infantry,  especially of the archery, largely stood for that popular element which  had already unhorsed the high French chivalry at Courtrai. But the point  is this; that while the lawyers were talking about the Salic Law, the  soldiers, who would once have been talking about guild law or glebe  law, were already talking about English law and French law. The French  were first in this tendency to see something outside the township, the  trade brotherhood, the feudal dues, or the village common. The whole  history of the change can be seen in the fact that the French had early  begun to call the nation the Greater Land. France was the first of  nations and has remained the norm of nations, the only one which is a  nation and nothing else. But in the collision the English grew equally  corporate; and a true patriotic applause probably hailed the victories  of Crecy and Poitiers, as it certainly hailed the later victory of  Agincourt. The latter did not indeed occur until after an interval of  internal revolutions in England, which will be considered on a later  page; but as regards the growth of nationalism, the French wars were  continuous. And the English tradition that followed after Agincourt was  continuous also. It is embodied in rude and spirited ballads before the  great Elizabethans. The Henry V. of Shakespeare is not indeed the Henry  V. of history; yet he is more historic. He is not only a saner and more  genial but a more important person. For the tradition of the whole  adventure was not that of Henry, but of the populace who turned Henry  into Harry. There were a thousand Harries in the army at Agincourt, and  not one. For the figure that Shakespeare framed out of the legends of  the great victory is largely the figure that all men saw as the  Englishman of the Middle Ages. He did not really talk in poetry, like  Shakespeare's hero, but he would have liked to. Not being able to do so,  he sang; and the English people principally appear in contemporary  impressions as the singing people. They were evidently not only  expansive but exaggerative; and perhaps it was not only in battle that  they drew the long bow. That fine farcical imagery, which has descended  to the comic songs and common speech of the English poor even to-day,  had its happy infancy when England thus became a nation; though the  modern poor, under the pressure of economic progress, have partly lost  the gaiety and kept only the humour. But in that early April of  patriotism the new unity of the State still sat lightly upon them; and a  cobbler in Henry's army, who would at home have thought first that it  was the day of St. Crispin of the Cobblers, might truly as well as  sincerely have hailed the splintering of the French lances in a storm of  arrows, and cried, \"St. George for Merry England.\"    Human things are uncomfortably complex, and while it was the April of  patriotism it was the Autumn of mediaeval society. In the next chapter I  shall try to trace the forces that were disintegrating the civilization;  and even here, after the first victories, it is necessary to insist on  the bitterness and barren ambition that showed itself more and more in  the later stages, as the long French wars dragged on. France was at the  time far less happy than England--wasted by the treason of its nobles  and the weakness of its kings almost as much as by the invasion of the  islanders. And yet it was this very despair and humiliation that seemed  at last to rend the sky, and let in the light of what it is hard for the  coldest historian to call anything but a miracle.    It may be this apparent miracle that has apparently made Nationalism  eternal. It may be conjectured, though the question is too difficult to  be developed here, that there was something in the great moral change  which turned the Roman Empire into Christendom, by which each great  thing, to which it afterwards gave birth, was baptized into a promise,  or at least into a hope of permanence. It may be that each of its ideas  was, as it were, mixed with immortality. Certainly something of this  kind can be seen in the conception which turned marriage from a contract  into a sacrament. But whatever the cause, it is certain that even for  the most secular types of our own time their relation to their native  land has become not contractual but sacramental. We may say that flags  are rags, that frontiers are fictions, but the very men who have said it  for half their lives are dying for a rag, and being rent in pieces for a  fiction even as I write. When the battle-trumpet blew in 1914 modern  humanity had grouped itself into nations almost before it knew what it  had done. If the same sound is heard a thousand years hence, there is no  sign in the world to suggest to any rational man that humanity will not  do exactly the same thing. But even if this great and strange  development be not enduring, the point is that it is felt as enduring.  It is hard to give a definition of loyalty, but perhaps we come near it  if we call it the thing which operates where an obligation is felt to be  unlimited. And the minimum of duty or even decency asked of a patriot is  the maximum that is asked by the most miraculous view of marriage. The  recognized reality of patriotism is not mere citizenship. The recognized  reality of patriotism is for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in  sickness and in health, in national growth and glory and in national  disgrace and decline; it is not to travel in the ship of state as a  passenger, but if need be to go down with the ship.    It is needless to tell here again the tale of that earthquake episode in  which a clearance in the earth and sky, above the confusion and  abasement of the crowns, showed the commanding figure of a woman of the  people. She was, in her own living loneliness, a French Revolution. She  was the proof that a certain power was not in the French kings or in the  French knights, but in the French. But the fact that she saw something  above her that was other than the sky, the fact that she lived the life  of a saint and died the death of a martyr, probably stamped the new  national sentiment with a sacred seal. And the fact that she fought for  a defeated country, and, even though it was victorious, was herself  ultimately defeated, defines that darker element of devotion of which I  spoke above, which makes even pessimism consistent with patriotism. It  is more appropriate in this place to consider the ultimate reaction of  this sacrifice upon the romance and the realities of England.    I have never counted it a patriotic part to plaster my own country with  conventional and unconvincing compliments; but no one can understand  England who does not understand that such an episode as this, in which  she was so clearly in the wrong, has yet been ultimately linked up with  a curious quality in which she is rather unusually in the right. No one  candidly comparing us with other countries can say we have specially  failed to build the sepulchres of the prophets we stoned, or even the  prophets who stoned us. The English historical tradition has at least a  loose large-mindedness which always finally falls into the praise not  only of great foreigners but great foes. Often along with much injustice  it has an illogical generosity; and while it will dismiss a great people  with mere ignorance, it treats a great personality with hearty  hero-worship. There are more examples than one even in this chapter, for  our books may well make out Wallace a better man than he was, as they  afterwards assigned to Washington an even better cause than he had.  Thackeray smiled at Miss Jane Porter's picture of Wallace, going into  war weeping with a cambric pocket-handkerchief; but her attitude was  more English and not less accurate. For her idealization was, if  anything, nearer the truth than Thackeray's own notion of a mediaevalism  of hypocritical hogs-in-armour. Edward, who figures as a tyrant, could  weep with compassion; and it is probable enough that Wallace wept, with  or without a pocket-handkerchief. Moreover, her romance was a reality,  the reality of nationalism; and she knew much more about the Scottish  patriots ages before her time than Thackeray did about the Irish  patriots immediately under his nose. Thackeray was a great man; but in  that matter he was a very small man, and indeed an invisible one. The  cases of Wallace and Washington and many others are here only mentioned,  however, to suggest an eccentric magnanimity which surely balances some  of our prejudices. We have done many foolish things, but we have at  least done one fine thing; we have whitewashed our worst enemies. If we  have done this for a bold Scottish raider and a vigorous Virginian  slave-holder, it may at least show that we are not likely to fail in our  final appreciation of the one white figure in the motley processions of  war. I believe there to be in modern England something like a universal  enthusiasm on this subject. We have seen a great English critic write a  book about this heroine, in opposition to a great French critic, solely  in order to blame him for not having praised her enough. And I do not  believe there lives an Englishman now, who if he had the offer of being  an Englishman then, would not discard his chance of riding as the  crowned conqueror at the head of all the spears of Agincourt, if he  could be that English common soldier of whom tradition tells that he  broke his spear asunder to bind it into a cross for Joan of Arc.
