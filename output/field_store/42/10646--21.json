[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22693"],[0,"A Book of Myths (#17)"],[1," Greek gods seem very remote.  Like the colours in an old, old portrait, the humanity of the stories  seems to have faded. But in Sicily they grow vivid at once. Almost, as  we stand above Syracuse, that long yellow town by the sea--a  blue-green sea, with deep purple shadows where the clouds above it  grow dark, and little white-sailed boats, like white butterflies, wing  their way across to the far horizon--can we        \"Have glimpse of Proteus rising from the sea,      Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.\"    Here, to this day, one of the myths most impossible of acceptance to  the scientific modern mind lives on, and Arethusa is not yet forgotten.  \"In Ortygia,\" says Cicero, \"is a fountain of sweet water, the name of  which is Arethusa, of incredible flow, very full of fish, which would  be entirely overwhelmed by the sea, were its waters not protected from  the waves by a rampart and a wall of stone.\" White marble walls have  taken the place of the protecting barrier, but the spring bubbles up to  this day, and Ortygia (Quail Island) is the name still given to that  part of Syracuse. Fluffy-headed, long, green stalks of papyrus grow in  the fountain, and red and golden fish dart through its clear water.  Beyond lie the low shores of Plemmgrium, the fens of Lysimeleia, the  hills above the Anapus, and above all towers Etna, in snowy and  magnificent serenity and indifference to the changes wrought by the  centuries to gods and to men. Yet here the present is completely  overshadowed by the past, and even the story of Arethusa knocks loudly  at the well-barricaded doors of twentieth-century incredulity.    The beautiful Arethusa was a nymph in Diana's train, and many a time  in the chase did she thread her way through the dim woodland, as a  stream flows down through the forest from the mountains to the sea.  But to her, at last, there came a day when she was no longer the  huntress but the hunted.    The flaming wheels of the chariot of Apollo had made the whole land  scintillate with heat, and the nymph sought the kind shelter of a wood  where she might bathe in the exquisite coolness of the river that  still was chilled by the snows of the mountain. On the branch of a  tree that bent over the stream she hung her garments, and joyously  stepped into the limpid water. A ray of the sun glanced through the  leaves above her and made the soft sand in the river's bed gleam like  gold and the beautiful limbs of the nymph seem as though carved from  pure white marble by the hand of Pygmalion himself. There was no sound  there but the gentle sound of the stream that murmured caressingly to  her as it slowly moved on through the solitude, and so gently it  flowed that almost it seemed to stand still, as though regretful to  leave for the unknown forest so beautiful a thing as Arethusa.        \"The Earth seemed to love her      And Heaven smiled above her.\"    But suddenly the stillness of the stream was ruffled. Waves, like the  newly-born brothers of the billows of the sea, swept both down-stream  and up-stream upon her, and the river no longer murmured gently, but  spoke to her in a voice that thrilled with passionate longing.  Alpheus, god of the river, had beheld her, and, beholding her, had  loved her once and forever. An uncouth creature of the forest was he,  unversed in all the arts of love-making. So not as a supplicant did he  come to her, but as one who demanded fiercely love for love. Terror  came upon Arethusa as she listened, and hastily she sprang from the  water that had brought fear upon her, and hastened to find shelter in  the woodlands. Then the murmur, as of the murmur of a river before a  mighty flood comes to seize it and hold it for its own, took form in a  voice that pled with her, in tones that made her tremble as she heard.    \"Hear me, Arethusa!\" it said. \"I am Alpheus, god of the river that now  thou hast made sacred. I am the god of the rushing streams--the god of  the thundering cataracts. Where the mountain streams crash over the  rocks and echo through the shadowy hollows of the hills, I hold my  kingship. Down from Etna I come, and the fire of Etna is in my veins.  I love thee! I love but thee, and thou shalt be mine, and I thine  forever.\"    Then Arethusa, in blind panic, fled before the god who loved her.  Through the shadowy forest she sped, while he swiftly gained upon her.  The asphodel bent under her flying feet, and the golden flowers of the  _Fiori Maggio_ were swept aside as she fled. Yet ever Alpheus gained  upon her, until at length she felt that the chase was ended, and cried  to Diana to save her. Then a cloud, grey and thick and blinding as the  mist that wraps the mountain tops, suddenly descended and enfolded  her, and Alpheus groped for her in vain.    \"Arethusa!\" she heard him cry, in a voice of piteous  longing--\"Arethusa!--my beloved!\"    Patiently he waited, with the love that makes uncouth things  beautiful, until at length a little breath from Zephyrus blew aside  the soft grey veil that hid his beloved from his sight, and he saw  that the nymph had been transformed into a fountain. Not for a moment  did Alpheus delay, but, turning himself into a torrent in flood, he  rushed on in pursuit of Arethusa. Then did Diana, to save her votary,  cleave a way for her through the dark earth even into the gloomy realm  of Pluto himself, and the nymph rushed onward, onward still, and then  upward, until at length she emerged again to the freedom of the blue  sky and green trees, and beheld the golden orange groves and the grey  olives, the burning red geranium flowers and the great snow-capped  mountain of Sicily.    But Alpheus had a love for her that cast out all fear. Through the  terrible blackness of the Cocytus valley he followed Arethusa, and  found a means of bursting through the encumbering earth and joining  her again. And in a spring that rises out of the sea near the shore he  was able at last to mingle his waters with those of the one for whom  he had lost his godship.          \"And now from their fountains        In Enna's mountains,      Down one vale where the morning basks,        Like friends once parted        Grown single-hearted,      They ply their watery tasks,        At sunrise they leap        From their cradles steep      In the cave of the shelving hill;        At noontide they flow        Through the woods below      And the meadows of asphodel;        And at night they sleep        In the rocking deep      Beneath the Ortygian shore;        Like spirits that lie        In the azure sky      When they love but live no more.\"            Shelley.          PERSEUS THE HERO        \"We call such a man a hero in English to this day, and      call it a 'heroic' thing to suffer pain and grief, that      we may do good to our fellow-men.\"            Charles Kingsley.      In the pleasant land of Argos, now a place of unwholesome marshes,  once upon a time there reigned a king called Acrisius, the father of  one fair daughter. Danae was her name, and she was very dear to the  king until a day when he longed to know what lay hid for him in the  lap of the gods, and consulted an oracle. With hanging head he  returned from the temple, for the oracle had told him that when his  daughter Danae had borne a son, by the hand of that son death must  surely come upon him. And because the fear of death was in him more  strong than the love of his daughter, Acrisius resolved that by  sacrificing her he would baffle the gods and frustrate Death itself. A  great tower of brass was speedily built at his command, and in this  prison Danae was placed, to drag out her weary days.    But who can escape the designs of the gods? From Olympus great Zeus  himself looked down and saw the air princess sighing away her youth.  And, full of pity and of love, he himself entered the brazen tower in  a golden shower, and Danae became the bride of Zeus and happily passed  with him the time of her imprisonment.    To her at length was born a son, a beautiful and kingly child, and  great was the wrath of her father when he had tidings of the birth.  Did the gods in the high heavens laugh at him? The laugh should yet be  on his side. Down to the seashore he hurried Danae and her newly-born  babe, the little Perseus, put them in a great chest, and set them  adrift to be a plaything for winds and waves and a prey for the cruel  and hungry sea.        \"When in the cunningly-wrought chest the raging blast      and the stirred billow and terror fell upon her, with      tearful cheeks she cast her arm around Perseus and      spake, 'Alas, my child, what sorrow is mine! But thou      slumberest, in baby-wise sleeping in this woeful ark;      midst the darkness of the brazen rivet thou shinest and      in the swart gloom sent forth; thou heedest not the deep      foam of the passing wave above thy locks nor the voice      of the blast as thou liest in thy purple covering, a      sweet face. If terror had terrors for thee, and thou      wert giving ear to my gentle words--I bid thee sleep, my      babe, and may the sea sleep and our measureless woe; and      may change of fortune come forth, Father Zeus, from      thee. For that I make my prayer in boldness and beyond      right, forgive me.'\"            Simonides of Keos.    For days and nights the mother and child were tossed on the billows,  but yet no harm came near them, and one morning the chest grounded on  the rocky beach of Seriphos, an island in the AEgean Sea. Here a  fisherman came on this strange flotsam and jetsam of the waves and  took the mother and child to Polydectes, the king, and the years that  followed were peaceful years for Danae and for Perseus. But as Perseus  grew up, growing each day more goodly to look upon, more fearless,  more ready to gaze with serene courage into the eyes of gods and of  men, an evil thing befell his mother.

In the year 1839 he left his country, and passed ten  years in the north of Asia and Europe, mostly among the Finnish tribes  of the Moguls, Ostiacks, Tsheremisses, Nordwins, &c., making himself  familiar with their manners, customs, dialects, songs, and traditions,  in order to attain a thorough personal acquaintance therewith. He also  spent a long period in Kasan and St. Petersburgh, studying the other  languages of Central Asia. His adventures during this time were, as may  be supposed, remarkable. He suffered not only the privations and  exposures inseparable from such an undertaking, but was also poorly  supplied with money, and often in the greatest distress from that cause.  Nothing but scientific enthusiasm carried him through, till he became  acquainted with some Russian savans, and a Russian Councillor named  Balugyanszky, who were of great assistance to him. He left his home a  vigorous young man, and comes back broken down in strength and health.  His investigations have related not only to philology, but to geography  and ethnography. He has penetrated farther into the north of Asia than  any previous traveller. On his return, at St. Petersburgh, he prepared,  at the special request of the Geographical Society, a vast map of  Northern Asia along the Ural Mountains, between 58 and 70 deg. north  latitude, and 72 and 80 deg. east longitude, giving about five hundred  localities. This map is made on the largest scale, containing sixteen  large quarto sheets. The _St. Petersburgh Gazette_ says of it, that it  has proved Reguly to be the discoverer of a vast territory for Russia.  He is now at Pesth, engaged in preparing for publication the fruits of  his ten years' absence from home. He will treat of the languages of the  European and Asiatic Finnish tribes, their grammar and vocabularies,  with constant regard to the analogies of the Magyar tongue. By way of  introduction he will first publish a special work, containing his  philosophical views on the organism of language. After these  philological treatises he will print a series of ethnographic works on  the various races among which he has lived, with collections of their  songs and traditions, and finally a detailed narrative of his travels,  with a condensed account of their scientific results. The conclusion of  his philological studies is briefly, that the Central-Asiatic, or as it  might be called, the Ural-Altaic group of languages, is divided into six  branches or families, namely, the language of the Mandshu Tartars, the  Mongols, the Turkish-Tartar tribes, the Samoyedes, the Fins, and the  Magyars. These families have however no nearer relation to each other  than the individual tongues of the Indo-European group, as the Indian,  the Romanic, German, Celtic, Slavic, and Persian languages. Still he  regards the Magyar and Finnic languages as having greater mutual  affinities than the others, though not to such a degree that one of  these races of men can be supposed to be derived from the other. He  rather supposes all of the races whose languages form the  Central-Asiatic group to have sprung from an original race, which was  probably Scythian.           *       *       *       *       *    The Austrian government has just set on foot an enterprise which  promises to be of use to both Literature and Science. The plan is, to  prepare and publish at the expense of the Imperial Treasury, a great  work on the ethnography of the Empire, and all savans, teachers,  artists, poets, of every race, are invited to furnish materials. It is  designed to give a complete account of the origin, history, manners,  language, character and condition of each of the many tribes and peoples  included under the Austrian sceptre. This will be combined of course  with descriptions of the country, scenery, climate, soil, minerals, and  natural and industrial productions of each region. It is supposed that  the whole will be completed in eight big volumes. It will be accompanied  by a vast ethnographic map, which is now being prepared with great  energy under the superintendence of the Minister of Commerce.           *       *       *       *       *    KARL GUTZKOW is one of the most prolific and popular novel and  playwrights now living in Germany. As to his last work, _Die Ritter vom  Geiste_ (The Knights of the Spirit), of which only the first volume has  been published, the critics entertain the most contradictory opinions.  Some exclaim at its great length, which indeed is rather terrific: there  are to be nine books, and the first occupies the whole of the first  volume. Others are charmed with the skill with which the details of the  work are wrought up, and the great variety of persons who figure in the  story. The author has certainly laid out all his strength in this book,  which is designed to reproduce the present age in all the contradictions  of its doctrines and the complexity of its tendencies. But instead of  seizing these in some central and vital point, and setting them forth in  a work whose very simplicity would conceal its depth from most readers,  Gutzkow has adopted the easier and more clumsy method of multiplying his  characters and complicating the actions of his drama. Thus it is hardly  possible for it not to be tedious and a failure. But we can speak of it  more fairly when it is farther advanced.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. NEANDER'S Library is advertised for sale by auction at Berlin, but  our correspondent thinks it will be saved from the hammer by a private  subscription, which will secure it to the University.           *       *       *       *       *    KARL SIMROCK has just brought out at Frankfort a new collection of  GERMAN POPULAR SONGS, not obsolete or artistic poems, but such as still  live among the people, and are familiar to every class. \"Among  _Volkslieder_,\" he says in his preface, \"I include only such as have  proceeded directly from the people, and still bear the tokens of their  origin, in their unsophisticated form, and simple, hearty language. The  pieces of cultivated poets which have found access and become loved with  the people, are reserved for a future collection of favorite German  songs. The distinction here hinted at between the people's songs and  popular songs is not generally understood. All previous collections have  confused the two, and some even have not a single production of the  people. For example, _Des Knaben Wunderhorn_, whose great merit must be  recognized, contains antique poems which by no means issued from among  the people.\" In another place he says: \"The songs here collected and  arranged have been newly written down, literally from the mouths of the  people; and where they could not be procured in this way, have been  corrected by comparison of all earlier versions. So that as they here  stand, they are in a sort my own property.\" The work is spoken of by  competent critics as perfectly successful. We believe that Simrock, who  is perhaps better qualified for the undertaking than any other man in  Germany, intends in a future edition to publish the melodies of the  songs along with the words.           *       *       *       *       *    Belgian Literature is a standing joke with the authors of Paris, and not  without reason, for the majority of the books printed by the publishers  of Belgium, are pirated from their French neighbors. There is, however,  such a thing as a Belgian literature, though it is not very extensive,  and one of its chief ornaments is Professor BORGNEL, of Liege, best  known as the author of a _Historie des Belges a la fin du dix-huilieme  Siecle_, published some six years since, to which he is about to bring  out an addition, carrying the history back to the beginning of the same  century. He has also been occupied for several years with the history of  the Flemish Provinces, under the domination of the Spaniards, and has a  work on that subject in preparation. The Introduction to it appeared not  long since among the Memoirs of the Brussels Academy, where it is  entitled: _Philippe I. et la Belgique_. In treating a subject which the  masterly pen of Schiller has already rendered familiar to the world,  Prof. Borgnel does not attempt to imitate the ardent and splendid  eloquence of that great poet and historian; Borgnel's merits are  distinctness in his outlines, remarkable clearness of arrangement,  perfect impartiality towards individuals and parties, and conscientious  use of materials. Of these he has had a greater variety, including many  manuscripts not before brought to light, than any previous writer.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the new books announced in London is _Notes on North America,  Agricultural, Social, and Economical_, by J. F. W. Johnston, author of  \"Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry.\" We may anticipate something of  value from a man of his studies and well earned reputation. Professor  Johnston passed the greater portion of his time, while in America, in  the British Provinces. He had been led to believe that they offered the  most interesting field for his professional observation. When he came  into New-England, New-York and Pennsylvania, he was continually  surprised at the perfection and the success of our agriculture. He  regretted only, that the mistake into which he had been led by British  travellers, had detained him from the United States until the period of  his absence from home was nearly expired. Professor Johnston's lectures  in New-York were given under singular disadvantages, but the too small  audiences who heard them were pleased and instructed. All who became  acquainted with him were impressed with a belief of his candor and his  talents. We hope to see immediately an edition of his book in this  country.           *       *       *       *       *    In Geissen, Prof. LIEBIG, has published a Review of the "]]]
