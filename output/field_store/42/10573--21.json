There were  by this time several such communities, and also, according to Cotton  Mather, many able Indian preachers. At the risk of his life, as he  insisted, Sausaman had warned the Plymouth magistrates that danger  impended. He was soon murdered, apparently by Philip's instigation. At  least Philip never denied this, nor did he after this time ever again  court friendly relations with Plymouth, which he had constantly done  hitherto. On the contrary, re-enforcements of strange Indians, all ready  for the war-path, were continually flocking to his camp, squaws and  children at the same time going to the Narraganset country, manifestly  for security.    The Plymouth authorities, preparing for war, yet sent a kind letter to  the sachem advising him to peace. In vain. At Swanzey, the town nearest  Mount Hope, Philip's home, Indians at once began to kill and ravage, and  Majors Bradford and Cudworth marched thither with a force of Plymouth  soldiers. A Massachusetts contingent re-enforced them there, and they  prepared to advance. Seeing it impossible to hold his own against so  many, Philip crossed to Pocasset, now Tiverton, and swept rapidly round  to Dartmouth, Middleborough, and Taunton, burning and murdering as he  went. He then retired again to Tiverton, but in a few days started with  all his warriors for central Massachusetts.    Here the Nipmucks, already at war, which indicated an understanding  between them and the Pokanokets, had attacked Mendon. The day after  Philip joined them there was a fight at Brookfield, the Nipmucks and  their allies being victorious. They proceeded to burn the town nearly  entire, though the inhabitants who survived, after a three days' siege  in a fortified house, were relieved by troops from Boston just in the  nick of time.    The Connecticut Valley was next the theatre of war. Springfield,  Hatfield, Deerfield, and Northfield were attacked the last two having to  be abandoned. At Hadley the onset occurred on a fast-day. The men rushed  from their worship with their muskets, which were ready to hand in  church, and hastily formed for battle. Bewildered by the unexpected  assault, they were on the point of yielding, when, according to  tradition, an aged hero with long beard and queer clothing appeared,  placed himself at their head and directed their movements. His evident  acquaintance with fighting restored order and courage. The savages were  driven pell-mell out of town, but the pursuers looked in vain for their  deliverer. If the account is correct, it was the regicide, General  Goffe, who had been a secret guest in the house of the Rev. Mr. Russell.  He could not in such danger refrain from engaging once again, as he had  so often done during the Civil War in England, in the defence of God's  people.    From Hadley a party went to Deerfield to bring in the wheat that had  been left when the town was deserted. Ninety picked men, the \"flower of  Essex,\" led by Captain Lothrop, attended the wagons as convoy. On their  return, about seven o'clock in the morning, by a little stream in the  present village of South Deerfield, since called Bloody Brook in memory  of the event, the soldiers dispersed somewhat in quest of grapes, then  ripe, when a sudden and fatal volley from an ambush was delivered upon  them. The men had left their muskets in the wagons and could not regain  them. Lothrop was shot dead, and but seven or eight of his company  escaped alive. A monument marks the spot where this tragic affair  occurred.    [Illustration: The Monument at Bloody Brook.]    So early as July, 1675, Massachusetts and Connecticut, acting for the  New England Confederation, had effected a treaty with the strong tribe  of the Narragansets in southern Rhode Island, engaging them to remain  neutral and to surrender any of Philip's men coming within their  jurisdiction. This agreement they did not keep. After the attacks on  Springfield and Hatfield in October, great numbers of the Pokanoket  braves came to them, evidently welcomed. To prevent their becoming a  centre of mischief, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Plymouth despatched  a thousand men to punish the Narragansets. They met the foe at the old  Palisade, in the midst of a dense swamp in what is now South Kingstown,  Rhode Island. The terrible cold which rendered this Narraganset campaign  so severe had turned the marsh into a bridge, and at once on their  arrival the soldiers, weary and hungry as they were from their long  march, and spite of its being Sunday, advanced to the attack.  Massachusetts was in front, then Plymouth, then Connecticut. Long and  bitter was the fight. The Indians, perfect marksmen, took deadly aim at  the leaders. Five captains were killed outright and as many more  mortally wounded. The fort was taken, re-taken, and taken again, the  whites at last, to make sure work, setting fire to the wigwams. The  storming party lost in killed and wounded one-fifth of its number. This  Swamp Fight, as it was called, broke forever the strength of the  Narragansets, the tribe and its allies dispersing in all directions.    [Illustration: Goffe at Hadley.]    [1676]    In 1676 central Massachusetts was again aflame. Lancaster was sacked and  burned, its inhabitants nearly all either carried captive or put to  death with indescribable atrocities. Mrs. Rowlandson, wife of the  Lancaster Minister, also her son and two daughters, were among the  captives. We have this brave woman's story as subsequently detailed by  herself. Her youngest, a little girl of six, wounded by a bullet, she  bore in her arms wherever they marched, till the poor creature died of  cold, starvation, and lack of care. The agonized mother begged the  privilege of tugging along the corpse, but was refused. She with her son  and living daughter were ransomed, after wandering up and down with the  savages eleven weeks and five days.    From Mrs. Rowlandson's narrative we have many interesting facts touching  the Indians' habits of life. They carried ample stores from Lancaster,  but soon squandered them, and were reduced to a diet of garbage, horses'  entrails, ears, and liver, with broth made of horses' feet and legs. The  liver they seemed to prefer raw. Their chief food was ground-nuts. They  also ate acorns, artichokes, beans, and various sorts of roots. They  especially delighted in old bones, which, being heated to drive out  maggots and worms, they first boiled for soup, then ground for use as  meal.    The captive lady often saw Philip. At his request she made a shirt and a  cap for his son, for which he paid her. Says Hubbard, \"Such was the  goodness of God to these poor captive women and children that they found  so much favor in the sight of their enemies that they offered no wrong  to any of their persons save what they could not help, being in many  wants themselves. Neither did they offer any uncivil carriage to any of  the females, nor ever attempt the chastity of any of them.\" So soon as  negotiations were opened for Mrs. Rowlandson's release, Philip told her  of this, and expressed the hope that they would succeed. When her ransom  had arrived he met her with a smile, saying: \"I have pleasant words for  you this morning; would you like to hear them? You are to go home  to-morrow,\" Twenty pounds were paid for her, raised by some ladies of  Boston, aided by a Mr. Usher.    Hostilities now bore southeastward. Philip was in his glory. All the  towns of Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts were in terror, nearly  all in actual danger. At Medfield twenty whites were killed. Deserted  Mendon was burned. Weymouth was attacked, and eleven persons were  massacred in the edge of Plymouth. In Groton and Marlborough every house  was laid in ashes, as were all in lower Rhode Island up to Warwick, and  in Warwick all but one. Sachem Canonchet of the Narragansets drew into  ambush at Pawtuxet a band of Plymouth soldiers, of whom only one  escaped. Canonchet was subsequently taken by Captain Denison and  executed. Rehoboth lost forty houses, Providence nearly as many.    The Connecticut Valley was invaded afresh. Springfield, Hadley,  Northampton, and Hatfield were once more startled by the war-whoop and  the whiz of the tomahawk. Captain Turner, hearing of an Indian camp at  the falls of the Connecticut, now called by his name, in Montague,  advanced with a troop of one hundred and eighty horse, arriving in sight  of the encampment at daylight. Dismounting and proceeding stealthily to  within sure shot, they beat up the Indians' quarters with a ringing  volley of musketry. Resistance was impossible. Those who did not fall by  bullet or sword rushed to the river, many being carried over the falls.  Three hundred savages perished, the English losing but one man.  A large  stock of the enemy's food and ammunition was also destroyed. Though so  splendidly successful, the party did not return to Hadley without  considerable loss, being set upon much of the way by Indians who had  heard the firing at the falls and sped to the relief of their friends.  Turner was killed in the meadows by Green River; his subordinate,  Holyoke, then commanding the retreat.    [1678]    Turner's victory brought the war to a crisis. The red men lacked  resources. The whites had learned the secrets of savage warfare. They  could no longer be led into ambush, while their foe at no time during  the war ventured to engage them in open field. Large parties of Indians  began to surrender; many roving bands were captured. Hostilities  continued still many months in Maine, the whites more and more uniformly  successful, till the Treaty of Casco, April 12, 1678, at last terminated  the war.    Hunted by the English backward and forward, Philip was at last driven to  his old home upon Mount Hope.

Jewish truth       had long sounded in the ears of the men of Medina, but it was not       till they heard the spirit-stirring strains of the Arabian prophet,       that they too awoke from their slumber, and sprang suddenly into a       new and earnest life.\"[133]    Further on Sir W. Muir says:--         \"And what have been the effects of the system which, established by       such instrumentality, Mahomet has left behind him. We may freely       concede that it banished for ever many of the darker elements of       superstition which had for ages shrouded the Peninsula. Idolatry       vanished before the battle-cry of Islam; the doctrine of the unity       and infinite perfections of God, and of a special all-pervading       Providence, became a living principle in the hearts and lives of       the followers of Mahomet, even as it had in his own. An absolute       surrender and submission to the divine will (the very name of       _Islam_) was demanded as the first requirement of the religion. Nor       are social virtues wanting. Brotherly love is inculcated within the       circle of the faith; orphans are to be protected, and slaves       treated with consideration; intoxicating drinks are prohibited,       and Mahometanism may boast of a degree of temperance unknown to any       other creed.\"[134]    Dr. Marcus Dods writes:--         \"But is Mahommed in no sense a Prophet? Certainly he had two of the       most important characteristics of the prophetic order. He saw truth       about God which his fellowmen did not see, and he had an       irresistible inward impulse to publish this truth. In respect of       this latter qualification Mahommed may stand comparison with the       most courageous of the heroic prophets of Israel. For the truth's       sake he risked his life, he suffered daily persecutions for years,       and eventually banishment, the loss of property, of the goodwill of       his fellow-citizens, and the confidence of his friends--he suffered       in short as much as any man can suffer short of death, which he       only escaped by flight, and yet he unflinchingly proclaimed his       message. No bribe, threat or inducement could silence him. 'Though       they array against me the sun on the right hand, and the moon on       the left, I cannot renounce my purpose.' And it was this       persistency, this belief in his call, to proclaim the Unity of God       which was the making of Islam. Other men have been monotheists in       the midst of idolaters, but no other man has founded a strong and       enduring monotheistic religion. The distinction in his case was his       resolution that other men should believe.... His giving himself out       as a prophet of God was, in the first instance, not only sincere,       but probably correct in the sense in which he himself understood       it. He felt that he had thoughts of God which it deeply concerned       all around him to receive, and he knew that these thoughts were       given him by God, although not, as we shall see, a revelation       strictly so called. His mistake lay by no means in his supposing       himself to be called upon by God to speak for him and introduce a       better religion, but it lay in his gradually coming to insist quite       as much on men's accepting him as a prophet as on their accepting       the great truth he preached. He was a prophet to his countrymen in       so far as he proclaimed the Unity of God, but this was no       sufficient ground for his claiming to be their guide in all matters       of religion, still less for his assuming the lordship over them in       all matters civil as well....\"    The learned doctor further on in his book, \"Mohammed, Buddha, and  Christ,\" remarks:--         \"But as we endeavour to estimate the good and evil of Islam, it       gradually appears that the chief point we must attend to is to       distinguish between its value to Arabia in the seventh century and       its value to the world at large. No one, I presume, would deny that       to Mohammed's contemporaries his religion was an immense advance on       anything they had previously believed in. It welded together the       disunited tribes, and lifted the nation to the forefront of the       important powers in the world. It effected what Christianity and       Judaism had alike failed to effect--it swept away, once and for       ever, idolatry, and established the idea of one true God. Its       influence on Arabia was justly and pathetically put by the Moslem       refugees in Abyssinia, who when required to say why they should not       be sent back to Mecca, gave the following account of their religion       and what it had done for them: 'O king, we were plunged in       ignorance and barbarism; we worshipped idols; we ate dead bodies;       we committed lewdness; disregarded family ties and the duties of       neighbourhood and hospitality; we knew no law but that of the       strong, when God sent among us a messenger of whose truthfulness,       integrity, and innocence we were aware; and he called us to the       unity of God, and taught us not to associate any god with him; he       forbade us the worship of idols, and enjoined upon us to speak the       truth, to be faithful to our trusts, to be merciful, and to regard       the rights of others; to love our relatives and to protect the       weak; to flee vice and avoid all evil. He taught us to offer       prayers, to give alms, and to fast. And because we believed in him       and obeyed him, therefore are we persecuted and driven from our       country to seek thy protection.'\"[135]    But after all we have here seen of the opinions of Dr. Marcus Dods and  Sir W. Muir, let us turn to what the Rev. Stephens thinks of Mohammad:--         \"The aim of Mahomet was to revive among his countrymen the Arabs,       as Moses revived among his countrymen the Jews, the pure faith of       their common forefather Abraham. In this he succeeded to a very       great extent. For a confused heap of idolatrous superstitions he       substituted a pure monotheistic faith; he abolished some of the       most vicious practices of his countrymen, modified others; he       generally raised the moral standard, improved the social condition       of the people, and introduced a sober and rational ceremonial in       worship. Finally he welded by this means a number of wild       independent tribes, mere floating atoms, into a compact body       politic, as well prepared and as eager to subdue the kingdoms of       the world to their rule and to their faith, as ever the Israelites       had been to conquer the land of Canaan.                *     *     *     *     *         \"The Koran also enjoins repeatedly and in very emphatic language       the duty of showing kindness to the stranger and the orphan, and of       treating slaves, if converted to the faith, with the consideration       and respect due to believers. The duty even of mercy to the lower       animals is not forgotten, and it is to be thankfully acknowledged       that Mohammedanism as well as Buddhism shares with Christianity the       honour of having given birth to hospitals and asylums for the       insane and sick.                *     *     *     *     *         \"The vices most prevalent in Arabia in the time of Mahomet which       are most sternly denounced and absolutely forbidden in the Koran       were drunkenness, unlimited concubinage and polygamy, the       destruction of female infants, reckless gambling, extortionate       usury, superstitious arts of divination and magic. The abolition of       some of these evil customs, and the mitigation of others, was a       great advance in the morality of the Arabs, and is a wonderful and       honourable testimony to the zeal and influence of the reformer. The       total suppression of female infanticide and of drunkenness is the       most signal triumph of his work.\"[136]    The reverend gentleman quoted above continues:         \"First of all, it must be freely granted that to his own people       Mahomet was a great benefactor. He was born in a country where       political organization, and rational faith, and pure morals were       unknown. He introduced all three. By a single stroke of masterly       genius he simultaneously reformed the political condition, the       religious creed, and the moral practice of his countrymen. In the       place of many independent tribes he left a nation; for a       superstitious belief in gods many and lords many he established a       reasonable belief in one Almighty yet beneficent Being; taught men       to live under an abiding sense of this Being's superintending care,       to look to Him as the rewarder, and to fear Him as the punisher of       evil-doers. He vigorously attacked, and modified and suppressed       many gross and revolting customs which had prevailed in Arabia down       to his time. For an abandoned profligacy was substituted a       carefully regulated polygamy, and the practice of destroying female       infants was effectually abolished.         \"As Islam gradually extended its conquest beyond the boundaries of       Arabia, many barbarous races whom it absorbed became in like manner       participators in its benefits. The Turk, the Indian, the Negro, and       the Moor were compelled to cast away their idols, to abandon their       licentious rites and customs, to turn to the worship of one God, to       a decent ceremonial and an orderly way of life. The faith even of       the more enlightened Persian was purified: he learned that good and       evil are not co-ordinate powers, but that just and unjust are alike       under the sway of one All-wise and Holy Ruler, who ordereth all       things in heaven and earth.
