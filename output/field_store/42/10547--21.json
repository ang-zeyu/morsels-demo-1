The count made a sign to Golo whose false eyes gleamed with devilish  joy, to lead the way.    Siegfried entered the dungeon, followed by his servants and also by  those who had travelled with him. Genovefa listened breathlessly in  her prison, with a loved name trembling on her lips and a prayer to  God in her heart. Now the terrible trial would come to an end, now she  would leave this dungeon of disgrace triumphantly, and exchange the  crown of thorns for the victor's wreath.    The bolt was unfastened, firm steps and men's voices were heard, the  iron doors were dashed open. She snatched her slumbering child, the  pledge of their love, and held it towards her dear husband. His name  was on her lips, but before she could utter it, a cry of agony escaped  her. He had cast her from him and, his accusations falling like blows  from a hammer on her head, the poor innocent countess fell senseless  to the ground. The next day two servants led mother and child out into  the forest, where with their own hands, they were to kill her who had  been so unfaithful to her husband, and her child also. They were to  bring back two tongues to the count as a proof that they had obeyed  his orders.    The servants drove them into the wildest depths of the forest where  only the screams of birds of prey broke the silence. They drew their  knives. But the poor countess fell on her knees, and holding up her  little child, implored them to spare their lives, if not for her sake,  at least for the sake of the helpless child. Pity entered the two  men's hearts and withheld their hands. Dragging the mother and child  still deeper into the forest, they turned away hastily, leaving their  victims to themselves.    They brought two harts' tongues to the count, informing him that they  had fulfilled his orders.      III.    Genovefa's tired feet wandered through the unknown forest, her child  crying with hunger. She prayed fervently to Heaven in her despair, and  tears were sent to relieve the dull pain in her heart, after which she  felt more composed, and her child was soon sweetly slumbering. To her  great astonishment she perceived a cavern near her, where she could  take shelter, and as if God wished to show that He had heard her  prayer, a white doe came towards the cavern, rubbing herself  caressingly against the abandoned woman. Willingly the gentle animal  allowed the little child to suckle it. The next day the doe came back  again, and Genovefa thanked God from the depths of her heart. She  found roots, berries, and plants, to support herself, and every day  the tame doe came back to her, and at last remained always with her.    Days, weeks, and months passed. Her unfaltering faith had rendered her  agony less. In time she learned to forgive her husband who had  condemned her unjustly, and she even pardoned him who had taken such  bitter revenge on her. Her lovely cheeks had become thinner, but the  forest winds had breathed a soft red into them, and the child who had  no cares nor gnawing pain in its heart, grew into a beautiful little  boy.      IV.    At the castle on the Rhine, sorrow was a constant guest since this  terrible event had happened. Siegfried's burning anger had sunk into  sorrow, and often when he was wandering restlessly through the rooms  so rich in sweet memories, where now a deserted stillness reigned, the  agony awoke again in his heart. He now repented of his hastiness, and  a voice whispered in his ear that he had been too severe in his cruel  punishment, that he had condemned too quickly, and that he should have  considered what he could have done to mitigate her punishment.    When these haunting voices pursued him, he would hurry away from the  castle and its loneliness, not being able to bear the torment of his  thoughts. Then to forget his trouble, he would follow the chase with  the yelping hounds. But he only seldom succeeded in dulling his  misery. Everywhere he seemed to see the pale face of a woman looking  imploringly at him.    The state of his master's soul had not escaped Golo, and this crafty  man cringed the more to the sorrowful count, feigning to care for his  welfare. A starving person accepts even the bread which a beggar-man  offers, and Siegfried, supposing his steward wished to compensate him  for his loss, accepted willingly every proof of devotion, and  recompensed him with his favour, at the same time hating the man in  his inmost soul who had rendered him such a terrible service.    One day the count rode out to the chase, accompanied by only a few  retainers, one of whom was Golo. Siegfried pressed deeper than was his  custom into the forest. A milkwhite doe sprang up before him and  sportsmanlike, he chased this singular animal through the bushes,  hoping to shoot it. His spear had just grazed it, when it disappeared  suddenly into a cavern. A woman whose ragged garments scarcely covered  her nakedness, leading a little boy by the hand, suddenly came out of  the opening in the rock, and the doe, seeking protection, rubbed  herself against her. She looked at the hunter, but her limbs trembled  so that she could scarcely stand, only her large sad eyes gazed  wistfully at him. A stifled cry, half triumphant, half a groan,  escaped from her lips, and she threw herself at the count's feet. From  the voice which for long months had only moved in earnest prayer or in  low sweet words to the child, now flowed solemn protestations of her  innocence. Her words burned like fire into the soul of the count, and  drawing her to his breast, he kissed her tears, and then sank at her  feet imploring her pardon.    He pressed his little boy to his heart, overcome with gratitude and  happiness, and wept with joy, calling him by a thousand affectionate  names.    Then at the sound of his bugle-horn his retinue hastened towards him,  Golo among them.    \"Do you know these two?\" thundered out the count to the latter,  tearing him from the throng and conducting him to Genovefa.    The wretch, as if struck by a club, broke down and, clasping his  master's knees, he confessed his wickedness and begged for mercy.  Siegfried thrust him contemptuously from him, refusing sternly, in  spite of the countess' intercession, to pardon his crime. Golo was  bound and led away, and a disgraceful death was his reward.           *       *       *       *       *    Now began a time of great happiness for Siegfried and his saint-like  wife, and they lived in undisturbed peace with their little son.    In gratitude to Heaven Siegfried caused a church to be built on the  spot where the white doe had appeared to him first. The countess often  made a pilgrimage to this house of God, to thank Him who had caused  her tears to be turned into joy. Then a day came when her corpse was  carried into the forest, and was buried in the church. Even now in  Laach, the wanderer is shown the church and the tombstone, also the  cavern where she suffered so much. Thus the name of St. Genovefa will  last to all time.          HAMMERSTEIN    The old Knight and his Daughters      [Illustration: Am Sarge Kaiser Heinrich IV.--Nach dem Gemaelde von  L. Rosenfelder--Zur Sage von der Burg Hammerstein]    Above Rheinbrohl, on a dreary sandstone rock, stand the ruins of the  old imperial fortress of Hammerstein. For a thousand years the storms  have beat on those desolate walls. One of the first owners was Wolf  von Hammerstein, a faithful vassal of the Emperor. It was Henry IV.  who then ruled, and partly by his own faults, partly by those of  others, the crown had indeed become to this sovereign one of thorns.  Wolf of Hammerstein had made the historic pilgrimage to Canossa alone  with his master. Now, on account of the infirmities of age the  venerable knight seldom descended the castle-hill, and only from afar,  the loud trumpet call of the world fell upon his ears. His wife, now  for several years deceased, had born him six daughters, all attractive  maidens and tenderly attached to their surviving parent, but their  filial affection met with the roughest and most ungrateful responses  from the sour old fellow. It was a sore grievance to Wolf of  Hammerstein that he had no son. He would willingly have exchanged his  halfdozen daughters for a single male heir. The girls were only too  well aware of this fact, and tried all the more, by constant love and  tender care to reconcile their ungracious parent to his lot.    One evening it thus befell. The autumn wind grumbled round the castle  like a croaking raven, and the old knight, Wolf of Hammerstein, sat by  a cheerful fire and peevishly nursed his gouty limbs. In spite of the  most assiduous attentions of his daughters he remained in a most surly  mood. The pretty maidens however kept hovering round the ill-tempered  old fellow like so many tender doves. Then the porter announced two  strangers. Both were wrapped in their knightly mantles, and in spite  of his troubles the hospitable lord of the castle prepared to welcome  his guests. Into the comfortable room two shivering and weary  travellers advanced, and as outlaws they craved shelter and protection  for the night. At the sound of one of the voices the knight started  up, listening eagerly, and when the stranger raised his visor and  threw back his mantle, Wolf of Hammerstein sank on his knees at the  stranger's feet, and seizing his hand he pressed it to his lips,  exclaiming: \"Henry, my lord and king!\" Then, with trembling voice the  Emperor told his old comrade-in-arms that he was a fugitive, and  before one who had torn from him the imperial crown and mantle. And  when the old knight, trembling with excitement, demanded who this  impious and dishonourable man might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],[0,"Christmas: A Story (#17)"],[1,"nd, like so many thieves. I rec'lect not seeing your names on  the paper.\"    \"No, I didn't sign,\" Ellen said. \"I voted against it that night at the  town meeting, but I guess nobody heard me.\"    \"Well,\" said Simeon, \"and so here you've got a Christmas of your own  going forward, neat as a kitten's foot--\"    \"Ain't you coming over to Mary Chavah's?\" Abel broke in with a kind of  gentleness. \"All of you?\"    Ellen smote her hands together.    \"I meant to go over later,\" she said, \"and take--\" She paused. \"I  thought we'd all go over later,\" she said. \"I forgot about it. Why, yes,  I guess we can go now, can't we? All three of us?\"    Abel Ames stood looking at the tree. He half guessed that she might have  dressed it for no one who would see it. He looked at Ellen and ventured  what he thought.    \"Ellen,\" he said, \"if you ain't going to do anything more with that tree  to-night, why not take some of the things off, and have Matthew set it  on his shoulder, and bring it over to Mary's for the boy that's  coming?\"    Ellen hesitated. \"Would they like it?\" she asked. \"Would folks?\"    Abel smiled. \"I'll take the blame,\" he said, \"and you take the tree.\"  And seeing Simeon hesitate, \"Now let's stop by for Mis' Moran's  coffee-pot,\" he added. \"Hustle up. The Local must be in.\"    So presently the tree, partly divested of its brightness, was carried  through the streets to the other house--in more than the magic which  attends the carrying in the open road of a tree, a statue, a cart filled  with flowers,--for the tree was like some forbidden thing that still  would be expressed.    \"_He_ might not come till Christmas is 'way past,\" Ellen thought,  following. \"She'll leave it standing a few days. We can go down there  and look at it--if he comes.\"    [Illustration: \"THEIR WAY LED EAST BETWEEN HIGH BANKS OF SNOW\"]    A little way behind them, Simeon and Abel, with the coffee-pot and the  warming oven, were hurrying back to Mary's. They went down the deserted  street where Abel's candle burned and Simeon's saint stood mute.    \"When I was a little shaver,\" Abel said, \"they used to have me stand in  the open doorway Christmas Eve, and hold a candle and say a verse. I  forget the verse. But I've always liked the candle in doors or windows,  like to-night. Look at mine over there now--ain't it like somebody  saying something?\"    \"Well,\" said Simeon, not to be outdone, \"when we come by my window just  now, the light hit down on it and I could of swore I see the saint  smile.\"    \"Like enough,\" said Abel, placidly, \"like enough. You can't put  Christmas out. I see that two weeks ago.\" He looked back at his own  window. \"If the little kid that come in the store last Christmas Eve  tries to come in again to-night,\" he said, \"he won't find it all pitch  dark, anyway. I'd like to know who he was....\"    Near the corner that turned down to the Rule Factory, they saw Ebenezer  Rule coming toward them on the Old Trail Road. They called to him.    \"Hello, Ebenezer,\" said Abel, \"ain't you coming in to Mary Chavah's  to-night?\"    \"I think not,\" Ebenezer answered.    \"Come ahead,\" encouraged Simeon.    As they met, Abel spoke hesitatingly.    \"Ebenezer,\" he said, \"I was just figuring on proposing to Simeon here,  that we stop in to your house--I was thinking,\" he broke off, \"how would  it be for you and him and me, that sort of stand for the merchandise end  of this town, to show up at Mary's house to-night--well, it's the women  have done all the work so far--and I was wondering how it would be for  us three to get there with some little thing for that little kid that's  coming to her--we could find something that wouldn't cost much--it  hadn't _ought_ to cost much, 'count of our set principles. And take it  to him....\" Abel ended doubtfully.    Ebenezer simply laughed his curious succession of gutturals.    \"Crazy to Christmas after all, ain't you?\" he said.    But Simeon wheeled and stared at Abel. For defection in their own camp  he had never looked.    \"I knew you'd miss it--I knew you'd miss it!\" Simeon said excitedly,  \"cut paper and fancy tassels and--\"    \"No such thing,\" said Abel, shortly. \"I was thinking of that boy getting  here, that's all. And I couldn't see why we shouldn't do our  share--which totin' coffee-pots and warming ovens _ain't_, as I see  it.\"    \"Well, but my heavens, man!\" said Simeon, \"it's Christmas! You can't go  giving anybody anything, can you?\"    \"I don't mean give it to him _for_ Christmas at all,\" protested Abel. \"I  mean give it to him just like you would any other day. We'd likely take  him something if it wasn't Christmas? Sort of to show our good will,  like the women with the supper? Well, why not take him some little thing  even if it is Christmas?\"    \"Oh, well,\" said Simeon, \"that way. If you make it plain it ain't _for_  Christmas--Of course, we ain't to blame for what day his train got in  on.\"    \"Sure we ain't,\" said Abel, confidently.    Ebenezer was moving away.    \"We'll call in for you in half an hour or so,\" Abel's voice followed  him. \"We'll slip out after the boy gets there. There won't be time  before ... what say, Ebenezer?\"    \"I think not,\" said Ebenezer; \"you don't need me.\"    \"Well--congratulations anyhow!\" Abel called.    Ebenezer stopped on the crossing.    \"What for?\" he asked.    \"Man alive,\" said Abel, \"don't you know Bruce has got a little girl?\"    \"No,\" said Ebenezer, \"I--didn't know. I'm obliged to you.\"    He turned from them, but instead of crossing the street to go to his  house, he faced down the little dark street to the factory. He had  walked past Jenny's once that evening, but without being able to force  himself to inquire. He knew that Bruce had come a day or two before, but  Bruce had sent him no word. Bruce had never sent any word since the  conditions of the failure had been made plain to him, when he had  resigned his position, refused the salary due him, and left Old Trail  Town. Clearly, Ebenezer could make no inquiry under those circumstances,  he told himself. They had cut themselves off from him, definitely.    How definitely he was cut off from them was evident as he went down the  dark street to the factory. He was strangely quickened, from head to  foot, with the news of the birth of Bruce's child. He went down toward  the factory simply because that was the place that he knew best, and he  wanted to be near it. He walked in the snow of the mid-road, facing the  wind, steeped in that sense of keener being which a word may pour in the  veins until the body flows with it. The third generation; the next of  kin,--that which stirred in him was a satisfaction almost physical that  his family was promised its future.    As he went he was unconscious, as he was always unconscious, of the  little street. But, perhaps because Abel had mentioned Mary's house, he  noted the folk, bound thither, whom he was meeting: Ben Torry, with a  basket, and his two boys beside him; August Muir, carrying his little  girl and a basket, and his wife following with a basket. Ebenezer spoke  to them, and after he had passed them he thought about them for a  minute.    \"Quite little families,\" he thought. \"I s'pose they get along.... I  wonder how much Bruce is making a week?\"    Nellie Hatch and her lame sister were watching at the lighted window, as  if there were something to see.    \"Must be kind of dreary work for them--living,\" he thought, \"... I  s'pose Bruce is pretty pleased ... pretty pleased.\"    At the corner, some one spoke to him with a note of pleasure in his  voice. It was his bookkeeper, with his wife and two partly grown  daughters. Ebenezer thought of his last meeting with his bookkeeper, and  remembered the man's smile of perfect comprehension and sympathy, as if  they two had something in common.    \"Family life does cling to a man,\" he had said.    That was his wife on his arm, and their two daughters. On that salary of  his.... Was it possible, it occurred to Ebenezer, that she was saving  egg money, earning sewing money, winning prizes for puzzles--as Letty  had done?    Outside the factory, the blue arc light threw a thousand shadows on the  great bulk of the building, but left naked in light the little office.  He stood looking at it, as he so rarely saw it, from part way across the  road. Seen so, it took on another aspect, as if it had emerged from some  costuming given it by the years. The office was painted brown, and  discoloured. He saw it white, with lozenge panes unbroken, flowered  curtains at the windows, the light of lamp and wood stove shining out.  And as sharply as if it had been painted on the air, he saw some  unimportant incident in his life there--a four-wheel carriage drawn up  at the door with some Christmas guests just arriving, and himself and  Letty and Malcolm in the open doorway. He could not remember who the  guests were, or whether he had been glad to see them, and he had no wish  in the world to see those guests again. But the simple, casual, homely  incident became to him the sign of all that makes up everyday life, the  everyday life of folk--_of folks_--from which he had so long been  absent.    His eye went down the dark little street where were the houses of the  men who were his factory \"hands.\" Just for a breath he saw them as they  were,--the chorus to the thing he was thinking about. They were all  thinking about it, too. Every one of them knew what he knew.... Just  for a breath he saw the little street as it was: an entity. Then the  sight closed, but through him ran again that sense of keener being, so  poignant that now, as his veins flowed with it, something deeper within  him almost answered.    He wheeled impatiently from where he stood. He wanted to do something.  At the end of the street he could see them crossing under the light, on  their way to Mary Chavah's. Abel and Simeon might stop for him ... but  how could he go there, among the folk whom he had virtually denied their  Christmas?"]]]
