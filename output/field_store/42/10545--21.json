This is the common alder of Great Britain and central Europe southward,  growing chiefly along water courses, in boggy grounds and upon moist  mountain slopes; introduced into the United States and occasionally  escaping from cultivation; sometimes thoroughly established locally. In  Medford, Mass., there are many of these plants growing about two small  ponds and upon the neighboring lowlands, most of them small, but among  them are several trees 30-40 feet in height and 8-12 inches in diameter  at the ground, distinguishable at a glance from the shrubby native  alders by their greater size, more erect habit, and darker trunks.

Nova Scotia through Quebec and Ontario.    Maine,--abundant; New Hampshire,--throughout the state; common on the  Connecticut-Merrimac watershed, enters largely into the composition of  the hardwood forests of Coos county; Vermont,--abundant;  Massachusetts,--in western sections abundant, common eastward;  Rhode Island and Connecticut,--common.         South to Florida; west to Wisconsin, Missouri, and Texas.    =Habit.=--A tree of great beauty, rising to a height of 50-75 feet, with  a diameter at the ground of 1-1/2-4 feet; under favorable conditions  attaining much greater dimensions; trunk remarkably smooth, sometimes  fluted, in the forests tall and straight, in open situations short and  stout; head symmetrical, of various shapes,--rounded, oblong, or even  obovate; branches numerous, mostly long and slender, curving slightly  upward at their tips, near the point of branching horizontal or slightly  drooping, beset with short branchlets which form a flat, dense, and  beautiful spray; roots numerous, light brown, long, and running near the  surface. Tree easily distinguishable in winter by the dried  brownish-white leaves, spear-like buds, and smooth bark.    =Bark.=--Trunk light blue gray, smooth, unbroken, slightly corrugated in  old trees, often beautifully mottled in blotches or bands and invested  by lichens; branches gray; branchlets dark brown and smooth; spray  shining, reddish-brown; season's shoots a shining olive green,  orange-dotted.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds conspicuous, long, very slender,  tapering slowly to a sharp point; scales rich brown, lengthening as the  bud opens. Leaves set in plane of the spray, simple, alternate, 3-5  inches long, one-half as wide, silky-pubescent with fringed edges when  young, nearly smooth when fully grown, green on both sides, turning to  rusty yellows and browns in autumn, persistent till mid-winter; outline  oval, serrate; apex acuminate; base rounded; veins strong, straight,  terminating in the teeth; leafstalk short, hairy at first; stipules  slender, silky, soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Appearing with the leaves from the season's  shoots, sterile flowers from the lower axils, in heads suspended at the  end of silky threads 1-2 inches long; calyx campanulate, pubescent,  yellowish-green, mostly 6-lobed; petals none; stamens 6-16; anthers  exserted; ovary wanting or abortive: fertile flowers from the upper  axils, usually single or in pairs, at the end of a short peduncle;  involucre 4-lobed, fringed with prickly scales; calyx with six  awl-shaped lobes; ovary 3-celled; styles 3.    =Fruit.=--A prickly bur, thick, 4-valved, splitting nearly to the base  when ripe: nut sharply triangular, sweet, edible.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows well in any  good soil, but prefers deep, rich, well-drained loam; usually obtainable  in nurseries; when frequently transplanted, safely moved. Its clean  trunk and limbs, deep shade, and freedom from insect pests make it one  of the most attractive of our large trees for use, summer or winter, in  landscape gardening; few plants, however, will grow beneath it; the bark  is easily disfigured; it has a bad habit of throwing out suckers and is  liable to be killed by any injury to the roots. Propagated from the  seed. The purple beech, weeping beech, and fern-leaf beech are  well-known horticultural forms.    [Illustration: PLATE XXXV.--Fagus ferruginea.]      1. Winter buds.    2.

South to Delaware, along the mountains to Alabama; west to       Michigan, Indiana, and Tennessee.    =Habit.=--A tree of the first magnitude, rising to a height of 60-80  feet and reaching a diameter of 5-6 feet above the swell of the roots,  with a spread sometimes equaling or even exceeding the height; attaining  often much greater proportions. The massive trunk separates usually a  few feet from the ground into several stout horizontal or ascending  branches, the limbs higher up, horizontal or rising at a broad angle,  forming a stately, open, roundish, or inversely pyramidal head;  branchlets slender; spray coarse and not abundant; foliage bright green,  dense, casting a deep shade; flowers profuse, the long, sterile catkins  upon their darker background of leaves conspicuous upon the hill  slopes at a great distance. A tree that may well dispute precedence with  the white or red oak.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk in old trees deeply cleft with wide ridges, hard,  rough, dark gray; in young trees very smooth, often shining; season's  shoots green or purplish-brown, white-dotted.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, ovate, brown, acutish.

The girls of the next  generation will rise up and call her blessed.          THE AMERICAN CHAPERONE    The question of the chaperone in America is peculiarly perplexing.  The  consternation of the hen whose brood of ducklings took to the water is  a fit symbol of the horrified amazement with which an old-world  \"duenna\" would be filled if she attempted to \"look after\" a bevy of  typical American girls, with their independent--yet confused--ideas of  social requirements in the matter of chaperonage.    In Europe, where social lines are distinctly drawn, a young woman  either belongs \"in society\" or else she does not.  In the former case  she is constantly attended by a chaperone.  In the latter case she is  merely a young person, a working girl, for whom \"society\" makes no  laws.  In our country there is a leisure class of \"society women,\" so  recognized.  If these alone constituted good society in America, we  might simply adopt the European distinctions, and settle the chaperone  question by a particular affirmative referring to these alone.  But we  reflect that our thoughts throughout this little volume are mainly for  those who dwell within the broad zone of the average heretofore  referred to.  In this republican land no one can say that the bounds of  good society lie arbitrarily here and there; certainly they are not  marked by a line drawn between occupation and leisure.  The same young  girl--after leaving school, at the period when society life begins--may  be \"in society\" during leisure hours and in business during working  hours.  It is accounted perfectly lady-like and praiseworthy for a  young woman, well born and bred, to support herself by some  remunerative employment that holds her to \"business hours.\"  She may be  a teacher, an artist, a scribe, an editor, a stenographer, a  book-keeper--what may she _not_ do, with talent, training, and good  sense?  And she may do this without being one iota less a lady--_if she  is one to begin with_.    Now appears the complication.  As a business woman, the self-reliant  young girl does not need a chaperone.  As a society woman, this  inexperienced, sensitive, human-nature-trusting child _does_ need a  chaperone.  She is, therefore, subject to what we may call intermittent  chaperonage.  Business, definite, serious occupation of any kind, is a  coat of mail.  The woman or girl who is plainly absorbed in some  earnest and dignified _work_ is shielded from misinterpretation or  impertinent intrusion while engaged in that work.  She may go  unattended to and from her place of business, for her destination is  understood, and her purpose legitimate.  She needs no guardian, for her  capacity to take care of herself _under these conditions_, is  demonstrated to a respectful public.  The spectacle of a stately  middle-aged woman accompanying each girl book-keeper to her desk every  morning would be burlesque in the extreme.  The girl who is thus  allowed to go alone to an office in business hours, sometimes thinks it  absurd for any one to say that she must not go alone to a drawing-room,  and she _does_ go alone.  Right here this independent girl makes a  mistake.  It is granted that the girl with brains and principle to bear  herself discreetly during office hours is probably able--in the  abstract--to exercise the same good sense at a party.    But _the conditions are changed_ to the eye of the onlooker.  The girl  who went to the office wearing the shield and armor of her work, now  appears in society _without that shield_.  To the observer she differs  in no wise from the banker's daughter, who \"toils not.\"  Like the  latter, she needs on social occasions the watchful chaperonage that  should be given to all young girls in these conditions.  The woman who  is in society at all must conform to its conventional laws, or lose  caste in proportion to her defiance of these laws.  She cannot defy  them without losing the dignity and exclusiveness that characterize a  well-bred woman, and without seeming to drift into the careless and  doubtful manners of \"Bohemia.\"  The fairy-story suggests the principle;  Cinderella could work alone in the dust and ashes undisturbed; but the  fairy-god-mother must needs accompany her when she went to the ball.  In the best circles everywhere, at home and abroad, every young girl  during her first years in society is \"chaperoned.\"  That is to say, on  all formal social occasions she appears under the watch and ward of an  older woman of character and standing--her mother, or the mother's  representative.  The young woman's calls are made, and her visits  received, in the company of this guardian of the proprieties; and she  attends the theatre or other places of amusement, only under the same  safe conduct.    Society to the young girl is May-fair.  With the happy future veiled  just beyond, she goes to meet a possible romance, and to traverse a  circle of events that may haply round up in a wedding-ring.  It is of  the utmost importance that she shall not be left at the mercy of  accidental meetings, indiscreet judgments, and the heedless impulses of  inexperienced youth, which may effectually blight her future in its  bud.  A parent or guardian does a girl incalculable injury in allowing  her to enter upon society life without chaperonage, and the unremitting  watch-care and control which only a discreet, motherly woman can give  to girlhood.  Men respect the chaperoned girl.  Honorable men respect  her as something that is worth taking care of; men who are not  honorable respect her as something with which they dare not be unduly  familiar--though they account it \"smart\" to be \"hail fellow well met\"  with the girl who ignorantly goes about unattended, or with other  unchaperoned girls, on social occasions.  A girl must have an unusual  measure of native dignity, as well as native innocence, always to  escape the disagreeable infliction of either \"fresh\" or _blase_  impertinence, if she has no mother's wing to flutter under.    This absolute condition of chaperonage exists during the novitiate of  the young society woman.  The requirement grows less and less rigid as  the young woman grows more and more experienced, and learns to meet  social emergencies for herself.  That delicate ignoring of a woman's  age which is shown in calling her a \"girl\" until she is married also  permits her to be a chaperoned member of society until that event.  But  when obviously past her youth, it is no longer required that she shall  wear the demeanor of a _debutante_.  Nor does propriety demand her  mother's constant presence, when years of training have taught the  daughter her mother's discretion, and when the mother's own serene  dignity looks out of the daughter's eyes.    We are proud of the ideal American girl.  I mean the one _who is  essentially a lady_, whether rich or poor, the one whose sterling good  sense is equal to her emergencies; the one who is self-reliant without  being bold, firm without being overbearing, brainy without being  masculine, strong of nerve--\"but yet a woman.\"  Let her be equipped for  the battle of life, which in our state of society so many girls are  fighting single-handed.  Instruct her in business principles; teach her  to use the discretion needed to move safely along the crowded  thoroughfare and to follow the routine of the office or the studio,  trusting that with busy head and busy hands she may be safe wherever  duty leads her tireless feet.  But in her hours of social recreation,  when she will meet and solve the vital problems of her own personal  life, she needs a subtle _something more_; the mother's wisdom to  supply the deficiencies of her inexperience, the mother's love to  enfold her in unspoken sympathy, the mother's approbation to rest upon  her dutiful conduct like a benediction.    Let no young girl regard this watch-care as a trammel placed on her  coveted liberty.  On the contrary, she will find that she has far more  social freedom with the countenance of her mother's presence than she  could have without it.  And in after years, when her life has developed  safely and happily under this discreet leadership, she will look back  to her _debut_, and her first seasons in society, with profound  gladness that--thanks to somebody wiser than herself--she has escaped  the follies that have in more or less measure injured the prospects of  her young friends who were too \"independent\" to submit to the  restraints of chaperonage, and who, for lack of it, to-day find  themselves to a relative extent depreciated in social estimation.          GREETINGS.  RECOGNITIONS.  INTRODUCTIONS.    The proverb, \"The beginning is half the battle,\" applies in a multitude  of ways.  In the first instant of a greeting between two people, the  ground upon which they meet should be indicated.  Cordiality, reserve,  distrust, confidence, caution, condescension, deference--whatever the  real or the assumed attitude may be, should be shown unmistakably when  eyes meet and heads bend in the ceremony of greeting.    To put into this initial manner the essence of the manner which one  chooses to maintain throughout is one of the fine touches of diplomacy.  People fail to do this when their effusively gracious condescension  subsequently develops into snobbishness, or when an austere stiffness  of demeanor belies the friendliness which they really intend to  manifest.  The latter fault is often due to diffidence or awkward  self-consciousness; the former is usually traceable to the caprice of  an undisciplined nature, and is a significant mark of ill-breeding.    The vital part of a greeting is in the expression of the eyes.  This is  so nearly spontaneous that the most guarded cannot altogether veil the  spirit that looks out of these \"windows of the soul.\"  The studied  attitude and genuflection fail to hide surliness or contempt; and  hostility, bitter and implacable, may"]]]
