[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#17)"],[1,"for the recent violent outbreaks in  India, where Anarchism has hardly been born.  More than any other old  philosophy, Hindu teachings have exalted passive resistance, the  drifting of life, the Nirvana, as the highest spiritual ideal.  Yet  the social unrest in India is daily growing, and has only recently  resulted in an act of political violence, the killing of Sir Curzon  Wyllie by the Hindu, Madar Sol Dhingra.    If such a phenomenon can occur in a country socially and individually  permeated for centuries with the spirit of passivity, can one  question the tremendous, revolutionizing effect on human character  exerted by great social iniquities?  Can one doubt the logic, the  justice of these words:    \"Repression, tyranny, and indiscriminate punishment of innocent men  have been the watchwords of the government of the alien domination in  India ever since we began the commercial boycott of English goods.  The tiger qualities of the British are much in evidence now in India.  They think that by the strength of the sword they will keep down  India!  It is this arrogance that has brought about the bomb, and the  more they tyrannize over a helpless and unarmed people, the more  terrorism will grow.  We may deprecate terrorism as outlandish and  foreign to our culture, but it is inevitable as long as this tyranny  continues, for it is not the terrorists that are to be blamed, but  the tyrants who are responsible for it.  It is the only resource for  a helpless and unarmed people when brought to the verge of despair.  It is never criminal on their part.  The crime lies with the  tyrant.\"[4]    Even conservative scientists are beginning to realize that heredity  is not the sole factor moulding human character.  Climate, food,  occupation; nay, color, light, and sound must be considered in the  study of human psychology.    If that be true, how much more correct is the contention that great  social abuses will and must influence different minds and  temperaments in a different way.  And how utterly fallacious the  stereotyped notion that the teachings of Anarchism, or certain  exponents of these teachings, are responsible for the acts of  political violence.    Anarchism, more than any other social theory, values human life above  things.  All Anarchists agree with Tolstoy in this fundamental truth:  if the production of any commodity necessitates the sacrifice of  human life, society should do without that commodity, but it can not  do without that life.  That, however, nowise indicates that Anarchism  teaches submission.  How can it, when it knows that all suffering,  all misery, all ills, result from the evil of submission?    Has not some American ancestor said, many years ago, that resistance  to tyranny is obedience to God?  And he was not an Anarchist even.  I would say that resistance to tyranny is man's highest ideal.  So  long as tyranny exists, in whatever form, man's deepest aspiration  must resist it as inevitably as man must breathe.    Compared with the wholesale violence of capital and government,  political acts of violence are but a drop in the ocean.  That so few  resist is the strongest proof how terrible must be the conflict  between their souls and unbearable social iniquities.    High strung, like a violin string, they weep and moan for life, so  relentless, so cruel, so terribly inhuman.  In a desperate moment the  string breaks.  Untuned ears hear nothing but discord.  But those who  feel the agonized cry understand its harmony; they hear in it the  fulfillment of the most compelling moment of human nature.    Such is the psychology of political violence.

PRISONS: A SOCIAL CRIME AND FAILURE      In 1849, Feodor Dostoyevsky wrote on the wall of his prison cell the  following story of THE PRIEST AND THE DEVIL:    \"'Hello, you little fat father!' the devil said to the priest.  'What made you lie so to those poor, misled people?  What tortures of  hell did you depict?  Don't you know they are already suffering the  tortures of hell in their earthly lives?  Don't you know that you and  the authorities of the State are my representatives on earth?  It is  you that make them suffer the pains of hell with which you threaten  them.  Don't you know this?  Well, then, come with me!'    \"The devil grabbed the priest by the collar, lifted him high in the  air, and carried him to a factory, to an iron foundry.  He saw the  workmen there running and hurrying to and fro, and toiling in the  scorching heat.  Very soon the thick, heavy air and the heat are too  much for the priest.  With tears in his eyes, he pleads with the  devil: 'Let me go! Let me leave this hell!'    \"'Oh, my dear friend, I must show you many more places.' The devil  gets hold of him again and drags him off to a farm.  There he sees  workmen threshing the grain.  The dust and heat are insufferable.  The overseer carries a knout, and unmercifully beats anyone who falls  to the ground overcome by hard toil or hunger.    \"Next the priest is taken to the huts where these same workers live  with their families--dirty, cold, smoky, ill-smelling holes.  The  devil grins.  He points out the poverty and hardships which are at  home here.    \"'Well, isn't this enough?' he asks.  And it seems as if even he, the  devil, pities the people.  The pious servant of God can hardly bear  it.  With uplifted hands he begs: 'Let me go away from here.  Yes,  yes!  This is hell on earth!'    \"'Well, then, you see.  And you still promise them another hell.  You torment them, torture them to death mentally when they are  already all but dead physically!  Come on!  I will show you one more  hell--one more, the very worst.'    \"He took him to a prison and showed him a dungeon, with its foul air  and the many human forms, robbed of all health and energy, lying on  the floor, covered with vermin that were devouring their poor, naked,  emaciated bodies.    \"'Take off your silken clothes,' said the devil to the priest, 'put  on your ankles heavy chains such as these unfortunates wear; lie down  on the cold and filthy floor--and then talk to them about a hell that  still awaits them!'    \"'No, no!' answered the priest, 'I cannot think of anything more  dreadful than this.  I entreat you, let me go away from here!'    \"'Yes, this is hell.  There can be no worse hell than this.  Did you  not know it?  Did you not know that these men and women whom you are  frightening with the picture of a hell hereafter--did you not know  that they are in hell right here, before they die?'\"      This was written fifty years ago in dark Russia, on the wall of one  of the most horrible prisons.  Yet who can deny that the same applies  with equal force to the present time, even to American prisons?    With all our boasted reforms, our great social changes, and our  far-reaching discoveries, human beings continue to be sent to the  worst of hells, wherein they are outraged, degraded, and tortured,  that society may be \"protected\" from the phantoms of its own making.    Prison, a social protection?  What monstrous mind ever conceived such  an idea?  Just as well say that health can be promoted by a  widespread contagion.    After eighteen months of horror in an English prison, Oscar Wilde  gave to the world his great masterpiece, THE BALLAD OF READING GOAL:              The vilest deeds, like poison weeds,              Bloom well in prison air;            It is only what is good in Man              That wastes and withers there.            Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,              And the Warder is Despair.    Society goes on perpetuating this poisonous air, not realizing that  out of it can come naught but the most poisonous results.    We are spending at the present $3,500,000 per day, $1,000,095,000 per  year, to maintain prison institutions, and that in a democratic  country,--a sum almost as large as the combined output of wheat,  valued at $750,000,000, and the output of coal, valued at  $350,000,000.  Professor Bushnell of Washington, D.C., estimates the  cost of prisons at $6,000,000,000 annually, and Dr. G. Frank Lydston,  an eminent American writer on crime, gives $5,000,000,000 annually as  a reasonable figure.  Such unheard-of expenditure for the purpose of  maintaining vast armies of human beings caged up like wild beasts![1]    Yet crimes are on the increase.  Thus we learn that in America there  are four and a half times as many crimes to every million population  today as there were twenty years ago.    The most horrible aspect is that our national crime is murder, not  robbery, embezzlement, or rape, as in the South.  London is five  times as large as Chicago, yet there are one hundred and eighteen  murders annually in the latter city, while only twenty in London.  Nor is Chicago the leading city in crime, since it is only seventh on  the list, which is headed by four Southern cities, and San Francisco  and Los Angeles.  In view of such a terrible condition of affairs, it  seems ridiculous to prate of the protection society derives from its  prisons.    The average mind is slow in grasping a truth, but when the most  thoroughly organized, centralized institution, maintained at an  excessive national expense, has proven a complete social failure, the  dullest must begin to question its right to exist.  The time is past  when we can be content with our social fabric merely because it is  \"ordained by divine right,\" or by the majesty of the law.    The widespread prison investigations, agitation, and education during  the last few years are conclusive proof that men are learning to dig  deep into the very bottom of society, down to the causes of the  terrible discrepancy between social and individual life.    Why, then, are prisons a social crime and a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#17)"],[1,"a, B. xiii. fo. 70.    [96] W. Malm, de Vita, Dunst. ap.

Aidan, the first bishop of  whom we have any distinct account, was appointed about the year 635. Bede  tells us that he used frequently to retire to the Isle of Farne, that he  might pray in private and be undisturbed.[153] This small island, distant  about nine miles from the church of Lindesfarne, obtained great  celebrity from St. Cuthbert, who sought that quiet spot and led there a  lonely existence in great continence of mind and body.[154] In 685 he was  appointed to the see of Lindesfarne, where, by his pious example and  regular life, he instructed many in their religious duties. The name of  this illustrious saint is intimately connected with a most magnificent  specimen of calligraphical art of the eighth century, preserved in the  British Museum,[155] and well known by the name of the Durham Book, or  Saint Cuthbert's Gospels; it was written some years after the death of  that Saint, in honor of his memory, by Egfrith, a monk of Lindesfarne,  who was made bishop of that see in the year 698. At Egfrith's death in  721, his successor, AEthilwald, most beautifully bound it in gold and  precious stones, and Bilfrid, a hermit, richly illuminated it by  prefixing to each gospel a beautiful painting representing one of the  Evangelists, and a tesselated cross, executed in a most elaborate manner.  He also displayed great skill by illuminating the large capital letters  at the commencement of each gospel.[156] Doubtless, the hermit Bilfrid  was an eminent artist in his day. Aldred, the Glossator, a priest of  Durham, about the year 950, still more enriched this precious volume by  interlining it with a Saxon Gloss, or version of the Latin text of St.  Jerome, of which the original manuscript is a copy.[157] It is  therefore, one of the most venerable of those early attempts to render  the holy scriptures into the vernacular tongue, and is on that account an  interesting relic to the Christian reader, and, no doubt, formed the  choicest volume in the library of Lindesfarne.[158]    But imperfectly, indeed, have I described the splendid manuscript which  is now lying, in all its charms, before me. And as I mark its fine old  illuminations, so bright in color, and so chaste in execution, the  accuracy of its transcription, and the uniform beauty of its calligraphy,  my imagination carries me back to the quiet cloister of the old Saxon  scribe who wrote it, and I can see in Egfrith, a bibliomaniac, of no mean  pretensions, and in Bilfrid, a monkish illuminator, well initiated in the  mysteries of his art. The manuscript contains 258 double columned folio  pages, and the paintings of the Evangelists each occupy an entire page.  We learn the history of its production from a very long note at the end  of the manuscript, written by the hand of the glossator.[159]    But sad misfortunes were in store for the holy monks, for about 793, or a  little earlier, when Highbald was abbot, the Danes burnt down the  monastery and murdered the ecclesiastics; \"most dreadful lightnings and  other prodigies,\" says Simeon of Durham, \"are said to have portended the  impending ruin of this place; on the 7th of June they came to the church  of Lindesfarne, miserably plundered all places, overthrew the altars, and  carried away all the treasures of the church, some of the monks they  slew, some they carried away captives, some they drowned in the sea, and  others much afflicted and abused they turned away naked.\"[160]  Fortunately some of the poor monks escaped, and after a short time  returned to their old spot, and with religious zeal set about repairing  the damage which the sacred edifice had sustained; after its restoration  they continued comparatively quiet till the time of Eardulfus, when the  Danes in the year 875, again invaded England and burned down the  monastery of Lindesfarne. The monks obtained some knowledge of their  coming and managed to effect their escape, taking with them the body of  St. Cuthbert, which they highly venerated, with many other honored  relics; they then set out with the bishop Eardulfus and the abbot Eadrid  at their head on a sort of pilgrimage to discover some suitable resting  place for the remains of their saint; but finding no safe locality, and  becoming fatigued by the irksomeness of the journey, they as a last  resource resolved to pass over to Ireland. For this purpose they  proceeded to the sea, but no sooner were they on board the ship than a  terrific storm arose, and had it not been for the fond care of their  patron saint, a watery grave would have "]]]
