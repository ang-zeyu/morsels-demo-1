The trick is  to introduce some word connected with the supposed crime in a list of  words connected with something quite different, yet a list in which it  occurs quite naturally. Thus I wrote 'heron' and 'eagle' and 'owl', and  when I wrote 'falcon' he was tremendously agitated; and when I began to  make an 'r' at the end of the word, that machine just bounded. Who else  in this republic has any reason to jump at the name of a newly-arrived  Englishman like Falconroy except the man who's shot him? Isn't that  better evidence than a lot of gabble from witnesses--if the evidence of  a reliable machine?\"    \"You always forget,\" observed his companion, \"that the reliable machine  always has to be worked by an unreliable machine.\"    \"Why, what do you mean?\" asked the detective.    \"I mean Man,\" said Father Brown, \"the most unreliable machine I know of.  I don't want to be rude; and I don't think you will consider Man to be  an offensive or inaccurate description of yourself. You say you observed  his manner; but how do you know you observed it right? You say the  words have to come in a natural way; but how do you know that you did it  naturally? How do you know, if you come to that, that he did not observe  your manner? Who is to prove that you were not tremendously agitated?  There was no machine tied on to your pulse.\"    \"I tell you,\" cried the American in the utmost excitement, \"I was as  cool as a cucumber.\"    \"Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers,\" said Brown with a smile.  \"And almost as cool as you.\"    \"Well, this one wasn't,\" said Usher, throwing the papers about. \"Oh, you  make me tired!\"    \"I'm sorry,\" said the other. \"I only point out what seems a reasonable  possibility. If you could tell by his manner when the word that might  hang him had come, why shouldn't he tell from your manner that the word  that might hang him was coming? I should ask for more than words myself  before I hanged anybody.\"    Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph.    \"And that,\" he cried, \"is just what I'm going to give you. I tried the  machine first just in order to test the thing in other ways afterwards  and the machine, sir, is right.\"    He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement. \"I rather want  to insist, if it comes to that, that so far I had very little to go on  except the scientific experiment. There was really nothing against the  man at all. His clothes were ill-fitting, as I've said, but they were  rather better, if anything, than those of the submerged class to which  he evidently belonged. Moreover, under all the stains of his plunging  through ploughed fields or bursting through dusty hedges, the man was  comparatively clean. This might mean, of course, that he had only just  broken prison; but it reminded me more of the desperate decency of  the comparatively respectable poor. His demeanour was, I am bound to  confess, quite in accordance with theirs. He was silent and dignified as  they are; he seemed to have a big, but buried, grievance, as they do.  He professed total ignorance of the crime and the whole question; and  showed nothing but a sullen impatience for something sensible that might  come to take him out of his meaningless scrape. He asked me more than  once if he could telephone for a lawyer who had helped him a long time  ago in a trade dispute, and in every sense acted as you would expect an  innocent man to act. There was nothing against him in the world except  that little finger on the dial that pointed to the change of his pulse.    \"Then, sir, the machine was on its trial; and the machine was right.  By the time I came with him out of the private room into the vestibule  where all sorts of other people were awaiting examination, I think  he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up by  something like a confession. He turned to me and began to say in a low  voice: 'Oh, I can't stick this any more. If you must know all about  me--'    \"At the same instant one of the poor women sitting on the long bench  stood up, screaming aloud and pointing at him with her finger. I have  never in my life heard anything more demoniacally distinct. Her lean  finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea-shooter. Though the  word was a mere howl, every syllable was as clear as a separate stroke  on the clock.    \"'Drugger Davis!' she shouted. 'They've got Drugger Davis!'    \"Among the wretched women, mostly thieves and streetwalkers, twenty  faces were turned, gaping with glee and hate. If I had never heard the  words, I should have known by the very shock upon his features that  the so-called Oscar Rian had heard his real name. But I'm not quite so  ignorant, you may be surprised to hear. Drugger Davis was one of the  most terrible and depraved criminals that ever baffled our police. It is  certain he had done murder more than once long before his last exploit  with the warder. But he was never entirely fixed for it, curiously  enough because he did it in the same manner as those milder--or  meaner--crimes for which he was fixed pretty often. He was a handsome,  well-bred-looking brute, as he still is, to some extent; and he used  mostly to go about with barmaids or shop-girls and do them out of their  money. Very often, though, he went a good deal farther; and they were  found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates and their whole property  missing. Then came one case where the girl was found dead; but  deliberation could not quite be proved, and, what was more practical  still, the criminal could not be found. I heard a rumour of his having  reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time, lending money  instead of borrowing it; but still to such poor widows as he might  personally fascinate, but still with the same bad result for them. Well,  there is your innocent man, and there is his innocent record. Even,  since then, four criminals and three warders have identified him and  confirmed the story. Now what have you got to say to my poor little  machine after that? Hasn't the machine done for him? Or do you prefer to  say that the woman and I have done for him?\"    \"As to what you've done for him,\" replied Father Brown, rising and  shaking himself in a floppy way, \"you've saved him from the electrical  chair. I don't think they can kill Drugger Davis on that old vague story  of the poison; and as for the convict who killed the warder, I suppose  it's obvious that you haven't got him. Mr Davis is innocent of that  crime, at any rate.\"    \"What do you mean?\" demanded the other. \"Why should he be innocent of  that crime?\"    \"Why, bless us all!\" cried the small man in one of his rare moments of  animation, \"why, because he's guilty of the other crimes! I don't know  what you people are made of. You seem to think that all sins are kept  together in a bag. You talk as if a miser on Monday were always a  spendthrift on Tuesday. You tell me this man you have here spent weeks  and months wheedling needy women out of small sums of money; that he  used a drug at the best, and a poison at the worst; that he turned up  afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender, and cheated most poor  people in the same patient and pacific style. Let it be granted--let us  admit, for the sake of argument, that he did all this. If that is so, I  will tell you what he didn't do. He didn't storm a spiked wall against a  man with a loaded gun. He didn't write on the wall with his own hand, to  say he had done it. He didn't stop to state that his justification was  self-defence. He didn't explain that he had no quarrel with the poor  warder. He didn't name the house of the rich man to which he was going  with the gun. He didn't write his own, initials in a man's blood. Saints  alive! Can't you see the whole character is different, in good and evil?  Why, you don't seem to be like I am a bit. One would think you'd never  had any vices of your own.\"    The amazed American had already parted his lips in protest when the  door of his private and official room was hammered and rattled in an  unceremonious way to which he was totally unaccustomed.    The door flew open. The moment before Greywood Usher had been coming to  the conclusion that Father Brown might possibly be mad. The moment after  he began to think he was mad himself. There burst and fell into his  private room a man in the filthiest rags, with a greasy squash hat still  askew on his head, and a shabby green shade shoved up from one of his  eyes, both of which were glaring like a tiger's. The rest of his face  was almost undiscoverable, being masked with a matted beard and whiskers  through which the nose could barely thrust itself, and further buried in  a squalid red scarf or handkerchief. Mr Usher prided himself on having  seen most of the roughest specimens in the State, but he thought he had  never seen such a baboon dressed as a scarecrow as this. But, above all,  he had never in all his placid scientific existence heard a man like  that speak to him first.    \"See here, old man Usher,\" shouted the being in the red handkerchief,  \"I'm getting tired. Don't you try any of your hide-and-seek on me; I  don't get fooled any. Leave go of my guests, and I'll let up on the  fancy clockwork. Keep him here for a split instant and you'll feel  pretty mean. I reckon I'm not a man with no pull.\"    The eminent Usher was regarding the bellowing monster with an amazement  which had dried up all other sentiments. The mere shock to his eyes had  rendered his ears, almost useless. At last he rang a bell with a hand  of violence. While the bell was still strong and pealing, the voice of  Father Brown fell soft but distinct.    \"I have a suggestion to make,\" he said, \"but it seems a little  confusing.

Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"wretched fiasco which attended the attack of the American fleet  upon the \"Glasgow\" was greatly deplored by Jones. However, he  refrained from any criticism upon his superiors, and sincerely  regretted the finding of the court of inquiry, by which the captain of  the \"Providence\" was dismissed the service, and Lieut. Paul Jones  recommended to fill the vacancy.    The duties which devolved upon Capt. Jones were manifold and arduous.  The ocean was swarming with powerful British men-of-war, which in his  little craft he must avoid, while keeping a sharp outlook for foemen  with whom he was equally matched. More than once, from the masthead of  the \"Providence,\" the lookout could discover white sails of one or  more vessels, any one of which, with a single broadside, could have  sent the audacious Yankee to the bottom. But luckily the \"Providence\"  was a fast sailer, and wonderfully obedient to her helm. To her good  sailing qualities, and to his own admirable seamanship, Jones owed  more than one fortunate escape. Once, when almost overtaken by a  powerful man-of-war, he edged away until he brought his pursuer on his  weather quarter; then, putting his helm up suddenly, he stood dead  before the wind, thus doubling on his course, and running past his  adversary within pistol-shot of her guns, but in a course directly  opposite to that upon which she was standing. The heavy war-ship went  plunging ahead like a heavy hound eluded by the agile fox, and the  Yankee proceeded safely on her course.    Some days later the \"Providence\" was lying to on the great banks near  the Isle of Sables. It was a holiday for the crew; for no sails were  in sight, and Capt. Jones had indulgently allowed them to get out  their cod-lines and enjoy an afternoon's fishing. In the midst of  their sport, as they were hauling in the finny monsters right merrily,  the hail of the lookout warned them that a strange sail was in sight.  The stranger drew rapidly nearer, and was soon made out to be a war  vessel. Jones, finding after a short trial that his light craft could  easily outstrip the lumbering man-of-war, managed to keep just out of  reach. Now and then the pursuer would luff up and let fly a broadside;  the shot skipping along over the waves, but sinking before they  reached the \"Providence.\" Jones, who had an element of humor in his  character, responded to this cannonade with one musket, which, with  great solemnity, was discharged in response to each broadside. After  keeping up this burlesque battle for some hours, the \"Providence\"  spread her sails, and soon left her foe hull down beneath the horizon.    After having thus eluded his pursuer, Jones skirted the coast of Cape  Breton, and put into the harbor of Canso, where he found three British  fishing schooners lying at anchor. The inhabitants of the little  fishing village were electrified to see the \"Providence\" cast anchor  in the harbor, and, lowering her boats, send two crews of armed  sailors to seize the British craft. No resistance was made, however;  and the Americans burned one schooner, scuttled a second, and after  filling the third with fish, taken from the other two, took her out of  the harbor with the \"Providence\" leading the way.    From the crew of the captured vessel, Jones learned that at the Island  of Madame, not far from Canso, there was a considerable flotilla of  British merchantmen. Accordingly he proceeded thither with the  intention of destroying them. On arriving, he found the harbor too  shallow to admit the \"Providence;\" and accordingly taking up a  position from which he could, with his cannon, command the harbor, he  despatched armed boats' crews to attack the shipping. On entering the  harbor, the Americans found nine British vessels lying at anchor.  Ships and brigs, as well as small fishing schooners, were in the  fleet. It was a rich prize for the Americans, and it was won without  bloodshed; for the peaceful fishermen offered no resistance to the  Yankees, and looked upon the capture of their vessels with amazement.  The condition of these poor men, thus left on a bleak coast with no  means of escape, appealed strongly to Jones's humanity. He therefore  told them, that, if they would assist him in making ready for sea such  of the prizes as he wished to take with him, he would leave them  vessels enough to carry them back to England. The fishermen heartily  agreed to the proposition, and worked faithfully for several days at  the task of fitting out the captured vessels. The night before the day  on which Jones had intended leaving the harbor, the wind came on to  blow, and a violent storm of wind and rain set in. Even the usually  calm surface of the little harbor was lashed to fury by the shrieking  wind. The schooner \"Sea-Flower\"--one of the captured prizes--was torn  from her moorings; and though her crew got out the sweeps, and  struggled valiantly for headway against the driving storm, she drifted  on shore, and lay there a total wreck. The schooner \"Ebenezer,\" which  Jones had brought from Canso laden with fish, drifted on a sunken  reef, and was there so battered by the roaring waves that she went to  pieces. Her crew, after vainly striving to launch the boats, built a  raft, and saved themselves on that.    The next day the storm abated; and Capt. Jones, taking with him three  heavily laden prizes, left the harbor, and turned his ship's prow  homeward. The voyage to Newport, then the headquarters of the little  navy, was made without other incident than the futile chase of three  British ships, which ran into the harbor of Louisbourg. On his  arrival, Jones reported that he had been cruising for forty-seven  days, and in that time had captured sixteen prizes, beside the  fishing-vessels he burned at Cape Breton. Eight of his prizes he had  manned, and sent into port; the remainder he had burned. It was the  first effective blow the colonists had yet struck at their powerful  foe upon the ocean.    Hardly had Paul Jones completed this first cruise, when his mind, ever  active in the service of his country, suggested to him a new  enterprise in which he might contribute to the cause of American  liberty. At this early period of the Revolution, the British were  treating American prisoners with almost inconceivable barbarity. Many  were sent to the \"Old Jersey\" prison-ship, of whose horrors we shall  read something later on. Others, to the number of about a hundred,  were taken to Cape Breton, and forced to labor like Russian felons in  the underground coal-mines. Jones's plan was bold in its conception,  but needed only energy and promptitude to make it perfectly feasible.    He besought the authorities to give him command of a squadron, that he  might move on Cape Breton, destroy the British coal and fishing  vessels always congregated there, and liberate the hapless Americans  who were passing their lives in the dark misery of underground mining.  His plan was received with favor, but the authorities lacked the means  to give him the proper aid. However, two vessels, the \"Alfred\" and the  \"Providence,\" were assigned to him; and he went speedily to work to  prepare for the adventure. At the outset, he was handicapped by lack  of men. The privateers were then fitting out in every port; and seamen  saw in privateering easier service, milder discipline, and greater  profits than they could hope for in the regular navy. When, by hard  work, the muster-roll of the \"Alfred\" showed her full complement of  men shipped, the stormy month of November had arrived, and the golden  hour for success was past.    Nevertheless, Jones, taking command of the \"Alfred,\" and putting the  \"Providence\" in the command of Capt. Hacker, left Newport, and laid  his course to the northward. When he arrived off the entrance to the  harbor of Louisbourg, he was so lucky as to encounter an English brig,  the \"Mellish,\" which, after a short resistance, struck her flag. She  proved to be laden with heavy warm clothing for the British troops in  Canada. This capture was a piece of great good fortune for the  Americans, and many a poor fellow in Washington's army that winter had  cause to bless Paul Jones for his activity and success.    The day succeeding the capture of the \"Mellish\" dawned gray and  cheerless. Light flurries of snow swept across the waves, and by noon  a heavy snowstorm, driven by a violent north-east gale, darkened the  air, and lashed the waves into fury. Jones stood dauntless at his post  on deck, encouraging the sailors by cheery words, and keeping the  sturdy little vessel on her course. All day and night the storm  roared; and when, the next morning, Jones, wearied by his ceaseless  vigilance, looked anxiously across the waters for his consort, she was  not to be seen. The people on the \"Alfred\" supposed, of course, that  the \"Providence\" was lost, with all on board, and mourned the sad fate  of their comrades. But, in fact, Capt. Hacker, affrighted by the  storm, had basely deserted his leader during the night, and made off  for Newport, leaving Jones to prosecute his enterprise alone.    Jones recognized in this desertion the knell of the enterprise upon  which he had embarked. Nevertheless, he disdained to return to port:  so sending the \"Mellish\" and a second prize, which the British  afterwards recaptured, back to Massachusetts, he continued his cruise  along the Nova Scotia coast. Again he sought out the harbor of Canso,  and, entering it, found a large English transport laden with  provisions aground just inside the bar. Boats' crews from the \"Alfred\"  soon set the torch to the stranded ship, and then, landing, fired a  huge warehouse filled with whale-oil and the products of the  fisheries. Leaving the blazing pile behind, the \"Alfred\" put out again  into the stormy sea, and made for the northward.    As he approached Louisbourg, Jones fell in with a considerable fleet  of British coal-vessels, in convoy of the frigate \"Flora.\" A "]]]
