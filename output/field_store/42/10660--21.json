I was little but mammy made me work. I shook de rugs, brung in  de kindlin' an run 'roun' waitin' on Mis' Virginia an' Mis' Fanny, doin'  things like totin' dey basket of keys, bringin' dey shawls and such as  dat. Dey was all de time talkin' about de folks fightin' an' what dey  would do if de Yankees come.    Every time dey talk Mis' Fanny set an' twist her han's an' say: \"What is  we gwine do, Sister, what is we gwine do?\"    Mis' Virginia try to pacify Mis' Fanny. She say, 'Don' yo' worry none,  Honey, I'll fix dem Yankees when dey come.' Den she set her mouf. When  she done dat I run an' hid behin' Mis' Fanny's chair kaze I done seed  Mis' Virginia set her mouf befo' an' I knowed she meant biznes'.    I didn' have sense enough to be skeered den kaze I hadn' never seed no  Yankee sojers, but 'twaren't long befo' I wuz skeered. De Yankees come  one mornin', an' dey ripped, Oh, Lawd, how dey did rip. When dey rode up  to de gate an' come stompin' to de house, Mis' Fanny 'gun to cry. 'Tell  dem somethin', Sister, tell dem somethin'; she tole Mis' Virginia.    Mis' Virginia she ain' done no cryin'. When she seed dem Yankees comin'  'cross de hill, she run 'roun' an' got all de jewelry. She took off de  rings an' pins she an' Mis' Fanny had on an' she got all de things out  of de jewelry box an' give dem to pappy. \"Hide dem, Lillmam\" she tole  pappy, 'hide dem some place whare dem thieves won't find dem'.    Pappy had on high top boots. He didn' do nothin but stuff all dat  jewelry right down in dem boots, den he strutted all' roun' dem Yankees  laughin' to heself. Dey cussed when dey couldn' fin' no jewelry a tall.  Dey didn' fin' no silver neither kaze us niggers done he'p Mis' Fanny  an' Mis' Virginia hide dat. We done toted it all down to de cottin gin  house an' hid it in de loose cotton piled on de floor. When dey couldn'  fin' nothin' a big sojer went up to Mis' Virginia who wuz standin' in de  hall. He look at her an' say: 'Yo's skeered of me, ain' yo'?'    Mis' Virginia ain' batted no eye yet. She tole him, \"If I was gwine to  be skeered, I'd be skeered of somethin'. I sho ain' of no ugly, braggin'  Yankee.\"    De man tu'ned red an he say: \"If you don' tell me where you done hide  dat silver I'se gwine to make' you skeered.\"    Mis' Virginia's chin went up higher. She set her mouf an' look at dat  sojer twell he drap his eyes. Den she tole him dat some folks done come  an' got de silver, dat dey done toted it off. She didn' tell him dat it  wuz us niggers dat done toted it down to de cotton gin house.    In dem days dey wuz peddlers gwine 'roun' de country sellin'  things. Dey toted big packs on dey backs filled wid everythin'  from needles an' thimbles to bed spreads an' fryin' pans. One day  a peddler stopped at Mis' Fanny's house. He was de uglies' man  I ever seed. He was tall an' bony wid black whiskers an' black  bushy hair an' curious eyes dat set way back in his head. Dey  was dark an' look like a dog's eyes after you done hit him. He  set down on de po'ch an' opened his pack, an' it was so hot an'  he looked so tired, dat Mis' Fanny give him er cool drink of milk  dat done been settin' in de spring house. All de time Mis' Fanny  was lookin' at de things in de pack an' buyin', de man kept up a  runnin' talk. He ask her how many niggers dey had; how many men  dey had fightin' on de 'Federate side, an' what wuz was she gwine do  if de niggers wuz was set free. Den he ask her if she knowed Mistah  Abraham Lincoln.    'Bout dat time Mis' Virginia come to de door an' heard what he said. She  blaze up like a lightwood fire an' told dat peddler dat dey didn't want  to know nothin' 'bout Mistah Lincoln; dat dey knowed too much already,  an' dat his name wuzn [HW correction: wasn't] 'lowed called in dat [HW  correction: her] house. Den she say he wuzn [HW correction: wasn't]  nothin' but a black debil messin' in other folks biznes' [HW correction:  business], an' dat she'd shoot him on sight if she had half a chance.    De man laughed. \"Maybe he [HW correction: Mr. Lincoln] ain't so bad,' he  told her. Den he packed his pack an' went off down de road, an' Mis'  Virginia watched him 'till he went out of sight 'roun' de bend.\"    Two or three weeks later Mis' Fanny got a letter. De letter was from dat  peddler. He tole her dat he was Abraham Lincoln hese'f; dat he wuz  peddlin' over de country as a spy, an' he thanked her for de res' on her  shady po'ch an' de cool glass of milk she give him.    When dat letter come Mis' Virginia got so hoppin' mad dat she took all  de stuff Mis' Fanny done bought from Mistah Lincoln an' made us niggers  burn it on de ash pile. Den she made pappy rake up de ashes an' th'ow  dem in de creek.          N. C. District:     No. 2               [320148]  Worker:             Mary A.

We belonged to John Neal of Person County. I doan know who my pappy  wuz, but my mammy wuz named Rosseta an' her mammy's name 'fore her wuz  Rosseta. I had one sister named Jenny an' one brother named Ben.    De marster wuz good ter us, in a way, but he ain't 'lowin' no kinds of  frolickin' so when we had a meetin' we had ter do it secret.

Andrews    [TR: Date Stamp \"AUG 6 1937\"]    PLANTATION LIFE IN GEORGIA    An interview with Midge Burnett, 80 years old, of 1300 S. Bloodworth  Street, Raleigh, North Carolina.      I wus borned in Georgia eighty years ago, de son of Jim an' Henretta  Burnett an' de slave of Marse William Joyner.    I wurked on de farm durin' slavery times, among de cotton, corn, an'  sugar cane. De wurk wusn't so hard an' we had plenty of time ter have  fun an' ter git inter meanness, dat's why Marse William had ter have so  many patterollers on de place.    Marse William had near three hundret slaves an' he kept seben  patterollers ter keep things goin' eben. De slaves ain't run away. Naw  sir, dey ain't, dey knows good things when dey sees dem an' dey ain't  leavin' dem nother. De only trouble wus dat dey wus crazy 'bout good  times an' dey'd shoot craps er bust.    De patterollers 'ud watch all de paths leadin' frum de plantation an'  when dey ketched a nigger leavin' dey whupped him an' run him home. As I  said de patterollers watched all paths, but dar wus a number of little  paths what run through de woods dat nobody ain't watched case dey ain't  knowed dat de paths wus dar.    On moonlight nights yo' could hear a heap of voices an' when yo' peep  ober de dike dar am a gang of niggers a-shootin' craps an' bettin'  eber'thing dey has stold frum de plantation. Sometimes a pretty yaller  gal er a fat black gal would be dar, but mostly hit would be jist men.    Dar wus a ribber nearby de plantation an' we niggers swum dar ever'  Sadday an' we fished dar a heap too. We ketched a big mess of fish ever'  week an' dese come in good an' helped ter save rations ter boot. Dat's  what Marse William said, an' he believed in havin' a good time too.    We had square dances dat las' all night on holidays an' we had a  Christmas tree an' a Easter egg hunt an' all dat, case Marse William  intended ter make us a civilized bunch of blacks.    Marse William ain't eber hit one of us a single lick till de day when  we heard dat de Yankees wus a-comin'. One big nigger jumps up an'  squalls, 'Lawd bless de Yankees'.    Marse yells back, 'God damn de Yankees', an' he slaps big Mose a  sumerset right outen de do'. Nobody else wanted ter git slapped soe  ever'body got outen dar in a hurry an' nobody else dasen't say Yankees  ter de marster.    Eben when somebody seed de Yankees comin' Mose wont go tell de' marster  'bout hit, but when Marster William wus hilt tight twixt two of dem big  husky Yankees he cussed 'em as hard as he can. Dey carries him off an'  dey put him in de jail at Atlanta an' dey keeps him fer a long time.

They constituted the most effective  military defense of Mohawk Valley. Still another portion took their way  across to the waters of the Susquehanna, and at Tulpehockon Creek began  an important center of German settlement in the Great Valley of  Pennsylvania.[82:2]    The most important aspect of the history of the movement into the  frontier of New York at this period, therefore, was the evidence which  it afforded that in the competition for settlement between colonies  possessing a vast area of vacant land, those which imposed feudal  tenures and undemocratic restraints, and which exploited settlers, were  certain to lose.    The manorial practice gave a bad name to New York as a region for  settlement, which not even the actual opportunities in certain parts of  the colony could counteract. The diplomacy of New York governors during  this period of the Old West, in securing a protectorate over the Six  Nations and a consequent claim to their territory, and in holding them  aloof from France, constituted the most effective contribution of that  colony to the movement of American expansion. When lands of these tribes  were obtained after Sullivan's expedition in the Revolution (in which  New England soldiers played a prominent part), it was by the New England  inundation into this interior that they were colonized. And it was under  conditions like those prevailing in the later years of the expansion of  settlements in New England itself, that this settlement of interior and  western New York was effected.    The result was, that New York became divided into two distinct peoples:  the dwellers along Hudson Valley, and the Yankee pioneers of the  interior. But the settlement of central and western New York, like the  settlement of Vermont, is a story that belongs to the era in which the  trans-Alleghany West was occupied.    We can best consider the settlement of the share of the Old West which  is located in Pennsylvania as a part of the migration which occupied the  Southern Uplands, and before entering upon this it will be advantageous  to survey that part of the movement toward the interior which proceeded  westward from the coast. First let us observe the conditions at the  eastern edge of these uplands, along the fall line in Virginia, in the  latter part of the seventeenth century, in order that the process and  the significance of the movement may be better understood.    About the time of Bacon's Rebellion, in Virginia, strenuous efforts  were made to protect the frontier line which ran along the falls of the  river, against the attacks of Indians. This \"fall line,\" as the  geographers call it, marking the head of navigation, and thus the  boundary of the maritime or lowland South, runs from the site of  Washington, through Richmond, and on to Raleigh, North Carolina, and  Columbia, South Carolina. Virginia having earliest advanced thus far to  the interior, found it necessary in the closing years of the seventeenth  century to draw a military frontier along this line. As early as 1675 a  statute was enacted,[84:1] providing that paid troops of five hundred  men should be drawn from the midland and most secure parts of the  country and placed on the \"heads of the rivers\" and other places  fronting upon the Indians. What was meant by the \"heads of the rivers,\"  is shown by the fact that several of these forts were located either at  the falls of the rivers or just above tidewater, as follows: one on the  lower Potomac in Stafford County; one near the falls of the  Rappahannock; one on the Mattapony; one on the Pamunky; one at the falls  of the James (near the site of Richmond); one near the falls of the  Appomattox, and others on the Blackwater, the Nansemond, and the Accomac  peninsula, all in the eastern part of Virginia.    Again, in 1679, similar provision was made,[84:2] and an especially  interesting act was passed, making _quasi_ manorial grants to Major  Lawrence Smith and Captain William Byrd, \"to seate certain lands at the  head [falls] of Rappahannock and James river\" respectively. This scheme  failed for lack of approval by the authorities in England.[84:3] But  Byrd at the falls of the James near the present site of Richmond,  Robert Beverley on the Rappahannock, and other frontier commanders on  the York and Potomac, continued to undertake colonial defense. The  system of mounted rangers was established in 1691, by which a  lieutenant, eleven soldiers, and two Indians at the \"heads\" or falls of  each great river were to scout for enemy,[85:1] and the Indian boundary  line was strictly defined.    By the opening years of the eighteenth century (1701), the assembly of  Virginia had reached the conclusion that settlement would be the best  means of protecting the frontiers, and that the best way of \"settling in  co-habitations upon the said land frontiers within this government will  be by encouragements to induce societies of men to undertake the  same.\"[85:2] It was declared to be inexpedient to have less than twenty  fighting men in each \"society,\" and provision was made for a land grant  to be given to these societies (or towns) not less than 10,000 nor more  than 30,000 acres upon any of the frontiers, to be held in common by the  society. The power of ordering and managing these lands, and the  settling and planting of them, was to remain in the society. Virginia  was to pay the cost of survey, also quit-rents for the first twenty  years for the two-hundred-acre tract as the site of the \"co-habitation.\"  Within this two hundred acres each member was to have a half-acre lot  for living upon, and a right to two hundred acres next adjacent, until  the thirty thousand acres were taken up. The members of the society  were exempt from taxes for twenty years, and from the requirements of  military duty except such as they imposed upon themselves. The  resemblance to the New England town is obvious.    \"Provided alwayes,\" ran the quaint statute, \"and it is the true intent  and meaning of this act that for every five hundred acres of land to be  granted in pursuance of this act there shall be and shall be continually  kept upon the said land one christian man between sixteen and sixty  years of age perfect of limb, able and fitt for service who shall alsoe  be continually provided with a well fixed musquett or fuzee, a good  pistoll, sharp simeter, tomahawk and five pounds of good clean pistoll  powder and twenty pounds of sizable leaden bulletts or swan or goose  shott to be kept within the fort directed by this act besides the powder  and shott for his necessary or useful shooting at game. Provided also  that the said warlike christian man shall have his dwelling and  continual abode within the space of two hundred acres of land to be laid  out in a geometricall square or as near that figure as conveniency will  admit,\" etc. Within two years the society was required to cause a half  acre in the middle of the \"co-habitation\" to be palisaded \"with good  sound pallisadoes at least thirteen foot long and six inches diameter in  the middle of the length thereof, and set double and at least three foot  within the ground.\"    Such in 1701 was the idea of the Virginia tidewater assembly of a  frontiersman, and of the frontier towns by which the Old Dominion should  spread her population into the upland South. But the \"warlike Christian  man\" who actually came to furnish the firing line for Virginia, was  destined to be the Scotch-Irishman and the German with long rifle in  place of \"fuzee\" and \"simeter,\" and altogether too restless to have his  continual abode within the space of two hundred acres. Nevertheless  there are points of resemblance between this idea of societies settled  about a fortified town and the later \"stations\" of Kentucky.[87:1]    By the beginning of the eighteenth century the engrossing of the lands  of lowland Virginia had progressed so far, the practice of holding large  tracts of wasteland for reserves in the great plantations had become so  common, that the authorities of Virginia reported to the home government  that the best lands were all taken up,[87:2] and settlers were passing  into North Carolina seeking cheap lands near navigable rivers. Attention  was directed also to the Piedmont portions of Virginia, for by this time  the Indians were conquered in this region. It was now possible to  acquire land by purchase[87:3] at five shillings sterling for fifty  acres, as well as by head-rights for importation or settlement, and land  speculation soon turned to the new area.    Already the Piedmont had been somewhat explored.[87:4] Even by the  middle of the seventeenth century, fur-traders had followed the trail  southwest from the James more than four hundred miles to the Catawbas  and later to the Cherokees. Col. William Byrd had, as we have seen, not  only been absorbing good lands in the lowlands, and defending his post  at the falls of the James, like a Count of the Border, but he also  engaged in this fur-trade and sent his pack trains along this trail  through the Piedmont of the Carolinas,[87:5] and took note of the rich  savannas of that region. Charleston traders engaged in rivalry for this  trade.    It was not long before cattle raisers from the older settlements,  learning from the traders of the fertile plains and peavine pastures of  this land, followed the fur-traders and erected scattered \"cow-pens\" or  ranches beyond the line of plantations in the Piedmont. Even at the  close of the seventeenth century, herds of wild horses and cattle ranged  at the outskirts of the Virginia settlements, and were hunted by the  planters, driven into pens, and branded somewhat after the manner of the  later ranching on the Great Plains.[88:1] Now the cow-drovers and the  cow-pens[88:2] began to enter the uplands. The Indians had by this time  been reduced to submission in most of the Virginia Piedmont--as Governor"]]]
