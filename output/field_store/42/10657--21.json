But the most pleasing intelligence, and that which chiefly inspired  hope, came from the south-east extremity of the island: Mr. Robinson  went round the coast; touched at Macquarie Harbour, visited Circular  Head, and Portland: there he took Lemina Beginna, a chief, and  twenty-two others, including thirteen conciliated at George's River.  These were brought round to Gun Carriage Island; a temporary abode,  ill-suited for their entertainment, and where several soon concluded  their troubled career.    Lemina complained that, many years ago, his wife had been taken away by  sealers, and entreated the Governor to procure her restoration; another  petitioned, that his sister and his mother might be recovered from the  same vile oppressors. The sister was known as Black Jock, and seems to  have been greatly in request: she was in alliance with the leader of one  of the parties--less modest than familiar. A sealer, from whom she had  eloped, when she came back to the coast demanded her, with some  vehemence, as his wife! So much beloved was this Tasmanian belle. The  arbitration of these disputes was no easy task: though sufficiently  ridiculous, they often seriously endangered the mission. The Governor  issued an order against the interference of the sealers, and declared  Mr. Robinson under the special protection of government.    In reference to these captures, the Governor publicly expressed his  great gratification, and requested the colonists to promote pacific  intercourse, by all available means. The discretion displayed by  Robinson, not less than his courage, excited much admiration, and hopes  were entertained that the true means of safety were at last discovered.  Mr. Robinson now requested that the armed parties should be recalled,  depots established to afford an asylum to the captives, and additional  agents employed. Mr. Cotterell, and others were engaged to act in  subordination to the movements of Robinson. The Sydney blacks, ten of  whom had been brought down by Mr. Batman, for the mission, had been  found less useful: they were rewarded, and sent home. The aborigines of  New Holland despised the Tasmanian blacks--a race, ignorant of the  _womera_![20]    In the following September, 1831, Mr. Robinson obtained another  considerable accession, assisted by Lemina Beginna: they travelled,  backwards and forwards, for four hundred miles, and found old  acquaintances. Eumarrah, the chief of the Stony Creek tribe, when he saw  Mr. Robinson, ran to him and shook hands, and with five men and one  woman, gave himself up: three only of his tribe remained! The captives  were described as remarkably athletic: they talked incessantly, and  complained bitterly that their women had been stolen. The inequality of  numbers confirmed this charge. While Robinson was with them, a boat's  crew came in sight; and it required all his influence to prevent the  natives from retreating with precipitation. Thus the evil they suffered  in their first intercourse, pursued them to the last moment of their  freedom.    M'Kay, who had been employed under Mr. Robinson, added to these  captures. Two friendly native women accompanied him, and they followed  the track for a week. At last, they found the natives encamped in a  plain: in the dead of night the party dashed in among them, and took two  men, one woman, and a boy. Surrage, also assisted by two native females,  captured eight men and two women. Their method was curious: the tame  women were sent up the hill, where the fires were seen: they returned;  four men followed them down to the boat, and six others, men and women,  were speedily seen in the footsteps of their companions.    While these captures were proceeding, Mr. Robinson started for the  Surrey Hills and Circular Head. He left the party lately conciliated in  Launceston: they were cheerful, and expected their proposed voyage to  the islands with great glee. They spoke of their past outrages without  reluctance, which they justified by relating the cruelties they had  suffered.    The Governor was anxious to notice every instance of intrepidity and  kindness: it is the coward that is ferocious. The indulgences of the  crown were freely given to persons, of whatever class, who exemplified  courage and humanity. Mr. Anstey, a young gentleman of the interior, was  rewarded with five hundred acres. He had surprised and taken several,  and the skill of his arrangements prevented the effusion of blood. In a  few instances, the natives voluntarily surrendered. Mr. Charles Headlam  saw two approaching, holding up their hands--thus indicating the absence  of their spears: he was standing on the threshold when he remarked the  signal, and immediately lowered his gun. These unfortunate beings were  admitted into the house, and supplied with food; and finally conducted  to a place of safety.    These feelings were occasionally damped by acts of atrocity, committed  by the blacks. It is not to be supposed, however, that provocation  ceased, or that the impulse given by four years conflict, could be  simultaneously paralysed. The tribes frequenting the Tamar and the  Forth, were represented as becoming increasingly mischievous. The fate  of Mrs. M'Alister was deeply affecting: when wounded, she ran bleeding  from her dwelling: her servants carried off the children to a place of  safety. The unhappy mother concealed herself, for a time, in a field of  corn: unable longer to suppress her anxiety, she rushed from her hiding  place, crying out for her children. She was seen by the blacks, and  slain! The relater of this catastrophe concludes--\"Let the sentence of  extermination in their hearts, be firmly sent forth on our parts.\" If we  shudder at such sentiments, they scarcely awaken surprise, when closing  a narrative like this.    The murder of Captain Thomas and Mr. Parker, by the Big River tribe,  renewed the exasperation. His servants, who had landed some provisions,  gave a small portion to the natives. He was told by three of the blacks,  that many were in the woods, and he resolved to follow them. Parker, who  accompanied him, advised him to take his gun. As they were walking, a  native snatched it away: they became alarmed and ran, and were pierced  with spears. This case seemed to indicate a hopeless spirit of innate  malice: Captain Thomas was known to be humane, and his object was to  conciliate. The natives had, however, experienced great cruelties from  the servants and others. A coroner's jury brought in a verdict of wilful  murder: those charged were arrested, and committed to gaol; afterwards,  they were removed to Flinders. As the vessel rounded the coast, the  scene of the murder was visible, and they became extremely agitated; but  the opinion of the colony was no longer favorable to executions, and the  government had discovered a more excellent way.    Mr. Robinson now landed at Circular Head, and assisted by his native  companions, he followed up the Big River tribe: he fell in with the  party at Lake Echo; they had moved with haste, and left behind several  stand of arms, a looking glass, and the gun of Captain Thomas. Other  encampments were passed, but when Robinson approached them, they  invariably fled. They had been to a spot twenty miles south-east of the  Van Diemen's Land Company's establishment, whither they were accustomed  to resort for a mineral, which is found in a decomposed bed of felspar.  From this place they were followed by Robinson, who overtook them thirty  miles north-west of the Peak of Teneriffe. He saw them first to the east  of the Barn Bluff Mountain, and was not more than two miles distant. He  hailed his people, and selected a few of his friendly natives, who,  together with the woman present at the murder of Captain Thomas, were  sent to meet them. The party of Robinson were concealed by a scrub. In  less than half an hour he heard the war-whoop, and perceived that they  were advancing, by the rattling of their spears. This was an awful  moment to their pacificator. On their approach, the chief, Manalanga,  leaped on his feet in great alarm, saying that the natives were coming  to spear them: he urged Mr. Robinson to run, and finding he would not,  took up his rug and spears and went away. The rest of the allies  prepared to follow him; but were prevailed on by Robinson to remain.  They inferred, that the natives sent on the embassy of peace, were  either killed, or that they had joined the hostile tribe. As these  advanced, the friendly emissaries were unseen, being hidden by the  larger number of the strangers, who still raised their cry, and  approached in warlike array. At length Robinson saw his own people: he  then went up to the chiefs and shook hands with them. He explained the  object of his visit; distributed trinkets among them, and sat down and  partook refreshment with them. From that time they placed themselves  under his control, and as they advanced towards Hobart Town, he  encouraged them to make excursions, which left their own actions free,  and prevented suspicion and distrust. With their wives and children,  this party consisted of thirty-six, and at length they were safely  lodged on Swan Island. They were fine muscular men, and excited great  interest and sympathy.    This incident suggested to the venerable artist, Mr. Duterreau, the idea  of a national picture: he depicts the interview, and delineates the  various countenances, drawn from the life, with great energy and effect.  Robinson is seen in expostulation with a listening chief; a woman,  behind him, is endeavouring to pour distrust into his ear. Others are  looking on in expectation or in doubt. The grouping is skilful and  expressive; and this picture, which has the great merit of minutely  representing the attitudes and customs of the natives, will be an  interesting memorial, in another age, of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22885"],[0,"Hindu Gods And Heroes (#17)"],[1,"religion. Almost every teacher who has a  personality of his own, whose soul contains thoughts other than those  of the common sort, stamps something of his own type upon the ideal of  his god which he imparts to his followers, and which may thereby come  to be authoritatively recognised as a canonical character of the god.  India is peculiarly liable to this transference of personality from  the guru to the god whom the guru preaches, because from immemorial  times India has regarded the guru as representative of the god, and  often deifies him as a permanent phase of the deity. Saivas declare  that in the guru who teaches the way of salvation Siva himself is  manifested: Vaishnavas tell the same tale, and find a short road to  salvation by surrendering their souls to him. We have seen cases of  apotheosis of the guru in modern and medieval times; reasoning from  the known to the unknown, we may be sure that it took place no less  regularly in ancient ages, and brought about most of the surprising  changes in the character of gods which we have noticed. Sometimes the  gurus have only preached some new features in the characters of their  gods; sometimes, as is the Hindu fashion, they have also exhibited in  their own persons, their dress and equipment, their original ideas of  divinity, as, for example, Lakulisa with his club; and their sanctity  and apotheosis have ratified their innovations in theology and  iconology, which have spread abroad as their congregations have grown.  Thus the gurus and their congregations have made the history of their  deities, recasting the gods ever anew in the mould of man's hopes and  strivings and ideals. There is much truth in the saying of the  Brahmanas: \"In the beginning the gods were mortal.\"           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
