On entering, we stood still and gazed  around us, while we were much impressed with the dreary stillness of the  room.  But what we saw there surprised and shocked us not a little.  There was no furniture in the apartment save a little wooden stool and  an iron pot, the latter almost eaten through with rust.  In the corner  farthest from the door was a low bedstead, on which lay two skeletons,  embedded in a little heap of dry dust.  With beating hearts we went  forward to examine them.  One was the skeleton of a man; the other that  of a dog, which was extended close beside that of the man, with its head  resting on his bosom.    Now we were very much concerned about this discovery, and could scarce  refrain from tears on beholding these sad remains.  After some time we  began to talk about what we had seen, and to examine in and around the  hut, in order to discover some clue to the name or history of this poor  man, who had thus died in solitude, with none to mourn his loss save his  cat and his faithful dog.  But we found nothing--neither a book nor a  scrap of paper.  We found, however, the decayed remnants of what  appeared to have been clothing, and an old axe.  But none of these  things bore marks of any kind, and indeed they were so much decayed as  to convince us that they had lain in the condition in which we found  them for many years.    This discovery now accounted to us for the tree-stump at the top of the  mountain with the initials cut on it; also for the patch of sugar-cane  and other traces of man which we had met with in the course of our  rambles over the island.  And we were much saddened by the reflection  that the lot of this poor wanderer might possibly be our own, after many  years' residence on the island, unless we should be rescued by the visit  of some vessel or the arrival of natives.  Having no clue whatever to  account for the presence of this poor human being in such a lonely spot,  we fell to conjecturing what could have brought him there.  I was  inclined to think that he must have been a shipwrecked sailor, whose  vessel had been lost here, and all the crew been drowned except himself  and his dog and cat.  But Jack thought it more likely that he had run  away from his vessel, and had taken the dog and cat to keep him company.  We were also much occupied in our minds with the wonderful difference  between the cat and the dog.  For here we saw that while the one  perished like a loving friend by its master's side, with its head  resting on his bosom, the other had sought to sustain itself by prowling  abroad in the forest, and had lived in solitude to a good old age.  However, we did not conclude from this that the cat was destitute of  affection, for we could not forget its emotions on first meeting with  us; but we saw from this that the dog had a great deal more of generous  love in its nature than the cat, because it not only found it impossible  to live after the death of its master, but it must needs, when it came  to die, crawl to his side and rest its head upon his lifeless breast.    While we were thinking on these things, and examining into everything  about the room, we were attracted by an exclamation from Peterkin.    \"I say, Jack,\" said he, \"here is something that will be of use to us.\"    \"What is it?\" said Jack, hastening across the room.    \"An old pistol,\" replied Peterkin, holding up the weapon, which he had  just pulled from under a heap of broken wood and rubbish that lay in a  corner.    \"That, indeed, might have been useful,\" said Jack, examining it, \"if we  had any powder; but I suspect the bow and the sling will prove more  serviceable.\"    \"True, I forgot that,\" said Peterkin; \"but we may as well take it with  us, for the flint will serve to strike fire with when the sun does not  shine.\"    After having spent more than an hour at this place without discovering  anything of further interest, Peterkin took up the old cat, which had  lain very contentedly asleep on the stool whereon he had placed it, and  we prepared to take our departure.  In leaving the hut, Jack stumbled  heavily against the door-post, which was so much decayed as to break  across, and the whole fabric of the hut seemed ready to tumble about our  ears.  This put it into our heads that we might as well pull it down,  and so form a mound over the skeleton.  Jack, therefore, with his axe,  cut down the other door-post, which, when it was done, brought the whole  hut in ruins to the ground, and thus formed a grave to the bones of the  poor recluse and his dog.  Then we left the spot, having brought away  the iron pot, the pistol, and the old axe, as they might be of much use  to us hereafter.    During the rest of this day we pursued our journey, and examined the  other end of the large valley, which we found to be so much alike to the  parts already described that I shall not recount the particulars of what  we saw in this place.  I may, however, remark that we did not quite  recover our former cheerful spirits until we arrived at our bower, which  we did late in the evening, and found everything just in the same  condition as we had left it three days before.        CHAPTER TWELVE.    SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TANK--JACK'S WISDOM AND PETERKIN'S  IMPERTINENCE--WONDERFUL BEHAVIOUR OF A CRAB--GOOD WISHES FOR THOSE WHO  DWELL FAR FROM THE SEA--JACK COMMENCES TO BUILD A LITTLE BOAT.    Rest is sweet, as well for the body as for the mind.  During my long  experience, amid the vicissitudes of a chequered life, I have found that  periods of profound rest at certain intervals, in addition to the  ordinary hours of repose, are necessary to the well-being of man.  And  the nature, as well as the period, of this rest varies according to the  different temperaments of individuals and the peculiar circumstances in  which they may chance to be placed.  To those who work with their minds,  bodily labour is rest; to those who labour with the body, deep sleep is  rest; to the downcast, the weary, and the sorrowful, joy and peace are  rest.  Nay, further, I think that to the gay, the frivolous, the  reckless, when sated with pleasures that cannot last, even sorrow proves  to be rest of a kind, although, perchance, it were better that I should  call it relief than rest.  There is, indeed, but one class of men to  whom rest is denied--there is no rest to the wicked.  At this I do but  hint, however, as I treat not of that rest which is spiritual, but more  particularly of that which applies to the mind and to the body.    Of this rest we stood much in need on our return home, and we found it  exceedingly sweet when we indulged in it after completing the journey  just related.  It had not, indeed, been a very long journey;  nevertheless, we had pursued it so diligently that our frames were not a  little prostrated.  Our minds were also very much exhausted in  consequence of the many surprises, frequent alarms, and much profound  thought to which they had been subjected; so that when we lay down, on  the night of our return, under the shelter of the bower, we fell  immediately into very deep repose.  I can state this with much  certainty; for Jack afterwards admitted the fact, and Peterkin, although  he stoutly denied it, I heard snoring loudly at least two minutes after  lying down.  In this condition we remained all night and the whole of  the following day without awaking once, or so much as moving our  positions.  When we did awake it was near sunset, and we were all in  such a state of lassitude that we merely rose to swallow a mouthful of  food.  As Peterkin remarked, in the midst of a yawn, we took breakfast  at tea-time, and then went to bed again, where we lay till the following  forenoon.    After this we arose very greatly refreshed, but much alarmed lest we had  lost count of a day.  I say we were much alarmed on this head; for we  had carefully kept count of the days, since we were cast upon our  island, in order that we might remember the Sabbath-day, which day we  had hitherto, with one accord, kept as a day of rest, and refrained from  all work whatsoever.  However, on considering the subject, we all three  entertained the same opinion as to how long we had slept, and so our  minds were put at ease.    We now hastened to our Water Garden to enjoy a bathe, and to see how did  the animals which I had placed in the tank.  We found the garden more  charming, pellucid, and inviting than ever; and Jack and I plunged into  its depths and gambolled among its radiant coral groves, while Peterkin  wallowed at the surface, and tried occasionally to kick us as we passed  below.  Having dressed, I then hastened to the tank; but what was my  surprise and grief to find nearly all the animals dead, and the water in  a putrid condition!  I was greatly distressed at this, and wondered what  could be the cause of it.    \"Why, you precious humbug!\" said Peterkin, coming up to me, \"how could  you expect it to be otherwise?  When fishes are accustomed to live in  the Pacific Ocean, how can you expect them to exist in a hole like  that?\"    \"Indeed, Peterkin,\" I replied, \"there seems to be truth in what you say.  Nevertheless, now I think of it, there must be some error in your  reasoning; for if I put in but a few very small animals, they will bear  the same proportion to this pond that the millions of fish bear to the  ocean.\"    \"I say, Jack!\" cried Peterkin, waving his hand; \"come here, like a good  fellow.  Ralph is actually talking philosophy.  Do come to our  assistance, for he's out o' sight beyond me already!\"    \"What's the matter?\" inquired Jack, coming up, while he endeavoured to  scrub his long hair dry with a towel of cocoa-nut cloth.    I repeated my thoughts to Jack, who, I was happy to find, quite agreed  with me.  \"The best plan,\" he said, \"will be to put very few animals at  first into your tank, and add more as you find it will "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#17)"],[1,"dry. The soap  is then in a condition to allow the impurities to gravitate. According  to the required soap, the fit may be \"coarse\" (\"open\") when the flakes  drop off the trowel readily, or \"fine\" (\"close\") when the flakes only  leave the trowel with difficulty.    If the dilution with water has been allowed to proceed too far, and too  fine a fit is produced, which would be denoted by the layer of soap not  leaving the trowel, a little caustic lye or brine may be very carefully  added and the whole well boiled until the desired condition is obtained.    A good pressure of steam is now applied to the pan, causing the contents  to swell as high as possible, this greatly facilitating the settling of  impurities; steam is then turned off, the pan covered, and the boil  allowed to rest for several days.    The art of fitting consists in leaving the contents of the pan in such a  condition that, on standing, all the impurities precipitate, and the  settled soap, containing the correct amount of water, is clear and  bright.    The above is a general practical outline of the ordinary soap-boiling  process. It may be modified or slightly altered according to the fancy  of the individual soap-maker or the particular material it is desired to  use. Fats and oils not only vary in the amount of alkali they absorb  during saponification, but also differ in the strength of the alkali  they require. Tallow and palm oil require lye of a density of 15 deg. to 18 deg.  Tw. (10 deg. to 12 deg. B.), but cocoa-nut oil alone would not saponify unless  the lye was more concentrated, 33 deg. to 42 deg. Tw. (20 deg. to 25 deg. B.).  Cotton-seed oil requires weak lyes for saponification, and, being  difficult to saponify alone even with prolonged boiling, is generally  mixed with animal fat.    When fats are mixed together, however, their varying alkali requirements  become modified, and once the saponification is begun with weak lye,  other materials are induced to take up alkali of a strength with which  alone they would not combine.    It is considered the best procedure to commence the pasting or  saponification with weak lye.    In order to economise tank space, it is the general practice to store  strong caustic lye (60 deg. to 70 deg. Tw., 33 deg. to 37 deg. B.) and to dilute it as  it is being added to the soap-pan by the simultaneous addition of water.    Many manufacturers give all their soap a \"brine wash\" to remove the last  traces of glycerine and free the soap from carbonates. This operation  takes place prior to \"fitting\"; sufficient water is added to the boiling  soap to \"close\" it and then brine is run in to \"grain\" it.    After resting, the liquor is withdrawn.    Having described the necessary operations in general, we will now  consider their application to the preparation of various kinds of hard  soap.    _Curd Soaps._--Tallow is largely used in the manufacture of white curd  soaps, but cocoa-nut oil sometimes enters into their composition.    The first three operations above described, _viz._, pasting, graining  out, and boiling on strength, are proceeded with; the clear boiling by  means of a closed steam coil is continued until the \"head\" is boiled out  and the soap is free from froth. A sample taken and cooled should be  hard. Boiling is then stopped, and, after covering, the pan is allowed  to rest for eight to ten hours, when the soap is ready for filling into  frames, where it is crutched until perfectly smooth.    _Curd mottled_ is usually made from melted kitchen stuff and bone  grease.    Its preparation is substantially the same as for curd soap, but the  clear boiling is not carried so far. The art of curd mottled soap-making  lies in the boiling. If boiled too long the mottling will not form  properly, and, on the other hand, insufficient boiling will cause the  soap to contain an excess of entangled lye. Having boiled it to its  correct concentration the pan is allowed to rest about two hours, after  which the soap is ready for framing, which should be done expeditiously  and the frames covered up.    Some lye, containing the impurities from the fats used, remains in the  interstices of the curd, unable to sink, and as the soap cools it is  enclosed and forms the mottling. The mottling may, therefore, be  considered as a crystallisation of the soap, in which the impurity forms  the colour.    _Blue and Grey Mottled Soaps._--These are silicated or liquored soaps in  which the natural mottling, due to the impure materials used in the  early days of soap-making, is imitated by artificial mottling, and are,  consequently, entirely different to curd mottled soaps.    The materials employed in making mottled soap comprise bleached palm  oil, tallow, bone fat, cocoa-nut oil, palm-kernel oil, cotton-seed oil,  and, in some instances, rosin.    The choice of a charge will naturally depend upon the cost; the property  of absorbing a large amount of liquor, which is characteristic of soaps  made from cocoa-nut oil and palm-kernel oil, is taken advantage of, as  are also the physical properties of the various fats and oils, with a  view to the crystallisation of the resultant soap and the development of  the mottle. The fat is saponified, grained and boiled on strength, as  previously described. After withdrawing the half-spent lye, the soap is  just closed by boiling with water, and is then ready for the silicate or  other saline additions.    Soap intended to be liquored with silicate of soda should be distinctly  strong in free alkali; the crystalline nature of the soap is increased  thereby, and the mottled effect intensified. Some makers, however, fit  the soap coarsely and allow a nigre to deposit; then, after removing the  nigre, or transferring the settled soap to another copper, containing  scraps of mottled soap, get the soap into a condition for mottling, and  add the silicate of soda solution. To every 1 cwt. of soap, 28 lb. of  silicate of soda solution, 32-1/2 deg. Tw. (20 deg. B.) is added, whilst  boiling; the strength of the silicate solution, however, will depend  upon the proportion of cocoa-nut oil and palm-kernel oil present in the  charge. Many soap-makers use 20 deg. Tw. (13 deg. B.) (cold) silicate solution,  whilst others prefer 140 deg. Tw. (59.5 deg. B.), with the gradual addition of  water to the soap, kept boiling, until the product is in the correct  mottling condition, and others, again, use bleach liquor, soda crystals,  pearl ash, and salt, together with silicate solution.    Considerable skill and experience is necessary to discern when the soap  acquires the correct mottling state. It should drop off the spatula in  large thick flakes, take considerable time to set, and the surface  should not be glossy.    When this mottling condition has been obtained, the colouring matter,  which would be ultramarine for the blue mottled and manganese dioxide  for the grey mottled soap (3-4 lb. ultramarine or 1-3 lb. manganese  dioxide being sufficient for 1 ton of soap), is mixed with a little  water and added to the boiling soap--the boiling is continued until all  is thoroughly amalgamated, and when the steam is shut off the contents  of the pan are ready for cleansing.    Mottled soap is run into wooden frames, which, when full, are covered  over and allowed to cool very gradually. On cooling slowly, large  crystals are produced which result in a distinct bold mottle; if the  cooling is too rapid, a small crystal is obtained and the mottle is not  distributed, resulting in either a small mottle, or no mottle at all,  and merely a general coloration. In fact, the entire art of mottling  soap consists in properly balancing the saline solutions and colouring  matter, so that the latter is properly distributed throughout the soap,  and does not either separate in coloured masses at the bottom of the  frame, or uniformly colour the whole mass.    A sample of the soap should test 45 per cent. fatty acids, and the  amount of salt would range from 1/2 to 1 per cent.    Some of the English mottled soaps, especially those made from materials  which give a yellow-coloured ground, are bleached by soaking in brine,  or pickling in brine containing 2 per cent. of bleach liquor. The  resultant soap has a white ground and is firm. The bleach liquor may be  made by mixing 1 cwt. bleaching powder with 10 cwts. of soda ash  solution (15 deg. Tw., 10 deg. B.), allowing to settle, and using the clear  liquid, or by mixing 2 parts soda ash solution with 1 part of bleaching  powder solution, both solutions being 30 deg. Tw. (18.8 deg. B.).    _Milling-base._--The materials generally used are tallows and cocoa-nut  oils of the finest quality. The tallow is thoroughly saponified first,  and the graining is performed by the aid of caustic soda lye in  preference to salt. The half-spent lyes are withdrawn, and the cocoa-nut  oil added to the pan. This is saponified, and when the saponification is  complete, \"boiling-on-strength\" is proceeded with. Special care should  be devoted to the \"boiling-on-strength\" operation--its value in good  soap-making cannot be over-rated--and perfect saponification must be  ensured. The half-spent lyes are allowed to deposit during the night,  and the soap must be carefully examined next morning to ascertain if any  alkali has been absorbed. If the caustic taste is permanent the  strengthening operation is complete, but should any caustic have been  absorbed, further addition of alkali must be made and the boiling  continued. These remarks apply equally to all soaps.    The soap, when ready, is fitted.    Bleached palm oil, olive oil, castor oil and lard are also employed in  the production of special milling soap bases, a palm oil soap being  specially suitable for the production of a violet-scented toilet soap.    _Yellow Household Soaps._ (_a_) _Bar Soaps._--These are made from tallow  with an admixture of from 15-25 per cent. rosin. The best quality is  known in the South and "]]]
