The question now occurs; What effect does its  presence and gratification produce upon the parents? We answer; It is a  natural and healthful impulse. Its influence is salutary. A marked  improvement in the physical condition of delicate women often follows a  happy marriage. This sometimes occurs even in those cases where, from  the nature of the disorder, the reverse might be expected. The utility  of the passions, well directed, has become a maxim in medicine as in  morality. And what passion is more important and fervent than that of  which we write? The fathers in medicine, and their modern followers,  agree in ascribing to the pleasures of love, indulged in with  moderation, activity and lightness of the body, vigor and vivacity of  the mind.    Music, apart from its immense influence on the nervous system in  general, seems sometimes to exercise a special action on the sexual  instinct. Science possesses at the present day some facts beyond  dispute, which prove the great power of music in this respect.      ON THE INDULGENCE AND THE RESTRAINT OF SEXUAL DESIRE.    The act of generation is a voluntary one. But nature has so placed it  under the empire of pleasure, that the voice of discretion is no longer  heard, and the will is often led captive. Hence it is well, for hygienic  reasons, to consider its laws.    The too frequent repetition of the reproductive act is known to be  followed by consequences injurious to the general health. Too rigid  continence is not unattended, in many constitutions, with danger, for  the victory over passion may be dearly bought. Science recommends the  adoption of a wise mean between two extremes equally destructive. By  following her counsel, women may escape from the hysterical and other  disorders which often wait as well upon excess as upon too great denial  of that passion, which claims satisfaction as a natural right.    As men have made laws upon all subjects, we need not be surprised to  learn that they have legislated upon this. History informs us that the  legislators of ancient times have not failed to occupy themselves with  this grave question of conjugal economy. The ordinances of Solon  required that the married should acquit themselves of their duties at  least three times a month; those of Zoroaster prescribed once a week.  Mohammed ordered that any wife neglected by her husband longer than a  week could demand and obtain a divorce. It is not, however, in these,  and other enactments which might be quoted, that guidance is to be  sought. The principles derived from nature and experience are more  valuable than human laws, however venerable; for these too often serve  only to reflect the profound ignorance of their makers.    Moderation should here prevail. Health is thus preserved and  strengthened, and the gratification doubled. The art of seasoning  pleasures in general, consists in being avaricious with them. To abstain  from enjoyment, is the philosophy of the sage, the epicurism of reason.    Proper self-denial in the gratification of the wants of physical love is  a source of good, not only to the individual practising it, but to the  community, as we shall show hereafter. It may be observed for one's own  profit only, or for the benefit of another. The latter is in the end  more conducive to self-interest than the former. A double advantage is  derived therefrom,--gratitude and sympathy returned, and increase of  appetite and of power for future enjoyment. Excess of indulgence results  in the pain of surfeit and the extinction of affection. Earnest love,  satisfying itself with small gratifications, is a more copious source of  happiness than that frequently quenched by full gratification.    What, then, is this moderation which both Hygeia and Venus command?  Here, again, invariable rules are not possible. Science rarely lays down  laws so inflexible as those of the Medes and Persians. She designates  limits. The passage between Scylla and Charybdis is often a wide one.  The folly of the ancient statutes which have been referred to, consists  mainly in their failure to recognise the diverse influence of age,  temperament, seasons, etc.    It almost appears as if there were but one _season_ for generation, that  in which the sun re-warms and vivifies the earth, trees dress in  verdure, and animals respire the soft breath of spring. Then every  living thing reanimates itself. The impulse of reproduction is excited.  Now, also, its gratification is most beneficial to the individual and to  the species. Children conceived in the spring time have greater  vitality, are less apt to die during infancy, than those conceived at  any other time of the year. The statistics of many thousand cases,  recently carefully collated in England, prove this beyond peradventure.  It is well known that a late calf, or one born at the end of the summer,  is not likely to become a well-developed and healthy animal. This has  been attributed to the chilling influence of approaching winter; but it  is capable of another and, perhaps, a truer explanation. Nature's  impulses, therefore, in the spring of the year are for the good of the  race, and may then be more frequently indulged without prejudice to the  individual. Summer is the season which agrees the least with the  exercise of the generative functions. The autumn months are the most  unfruitful. Then, also, derangements of the economy are readily excited  by marital intemperance.    The _temperaments_ exert over reproduction, as over all the other  functions of the body, a powerful influence. Love is said to be the  ruling passion in the sanguine temperament, as ambition is in the  bilious. There is also in some cases a peculiar condition of the nervous  system which impels to, or diverts from, sexual indulgence. In some  women, even in moderation, it acts as a poison, being followed by  headache and prostration, lasting for days.    With advancing years, the fading of sexual desire calls attention to the  general law, that animals and plants, when they become old, are dead to  reproduction. What in early life is followed by temporary languor, in  matured years is succeeded by a train of symptoms much graver and more  durable.    Those who are in feeble health, and particularly those who have delicate  chests, ought to be sober in the gratification of love. Sexual  intercourse has proved mortal after severe haemorrhages.    All organized beings are powerfully affected by propagation. Animals  become depressed and dejected after it. The flower which shines so  brilliantly at the moment of its amours, after the consummation of that  act, withers and falls. It is wise, therefore, in imparting life, to  have a care not to shorten one's own existence. Nothing is more certain  than that animals and plants lessen the duration of their lives by  multiplied sexual enjoyments. The abuse of these pleasures produces  lassitude and weakness. Beauty of feature and grace of movement are  sacrificed. When the excess is long continued, it occasions spasmodic  and convulsive affections, enfeeblement of the senses, particularly that  of sight, deprivation of the mental functions, loss of memory,  pulmonary consumption and death. One of the most eminent of living  physiologists has asserted that 'development of the individual and the  reproduction of the species stand in a reverse ratio to each other,' and  that 'the highest degree of bodily rigor is inconsistent with more than  a very modest indulgence in sexual intercourse.'    The general principles we have just enunciated are of great importance  in the regulation of the health. They are more suggestive and useful  than the precise rules which have from time to time been laid down on  this subject.      TIMES WHEN MARITAL RELATIONS SHOULD BE SUSPENDED.    There are times at which marital relations are eminently improper. We  are told, I Cor. vii. 3, 4, that neither husband nor wife has the power  to refuse the conjugal obligation when the debt is demanded. But there  are certain legitimate causes for denial by the wife.    A condition of intoxication in the husband is a proper ground for  refusal. Fecundation taking place while either parent has been in this  state has produced idiots and epileptics. This has happened again and  again. The cases on record are so numerous and well-authenticated, as to  admit of no doubt in regard to the fatal effect upon the mind of the  offspring of conception under such circumstances.    Physical degeneracy is also often a consequence of procreation during  the alcoholic intoxication of one or both parents. A peculiar arrest of  growth and development of body and mind takes place, and, in some  instances, the unfortunate children, although living to years of  manhood, remain permanent infants, just able to stand by the side of a  chair, to utter a few simple sounds, and to be amused with childish  toys.    During convalescence from a severe sickness, or when there is any local  or constitutional disease which would be aggravated by sexual  intercourse, it should be abstained from. There is reason for believing  that a being procreated at a period of ill-humour, bodily indisposition,  or nervous debility, may carry with it, during its whole existence, some  small particles of these evils. When there exists any contagious  disease, refusals are of course valid, and often a duty to the unborn.  Poverty, or the wish to have no more children, can only be exceptionally  allowed as a reason for the denial of all conjugal privileges.    The opinion that sexual relations practised during the time of the  menses engender children liable to scrofulous disease, is a mere popular  prejudice. But there are other and better-founded reasons for continence  during these periods.

He sees life as a glory as Baudelaire saw it as a  corpse. After a reading of \"The Hound of Heaven,\" with its glorious  colour, its glow, its flame, all other modern poets seem to me to be a  pale mauve by comparison to its flaming gold and crimson.    To many of my friends who love modern poets each in his degree, this  seems unreasonable and even incomprehensible; but to me it is very real;  and all literature which assumes to treat our lives as if Christianity  did not exist lacks that satisfactory quality which one finds in Dante,  in Calderon, in Sir Thomas More, and in Shakespeare. It is possible that  the prevalence of doubt in modern poetry is the cause of its lack of  gaiety. There is a modern belief that gaiety went out of fashion when  Pan died or disappeared into hidden haunts. This is not true. The Greeks  were gay at times and joyous at times, but if their philosophers  represent them, joyousness and gaiety were not essential points of their  lives.    The highest cultivation of its time could not save Athens from  despondency and destruction, and when the leaders in the city of Rome  came to believe so little in life that only the proletariat had  children, it was evident that their very tolerant system of adopting any  god that pleased them did not add to the joy of life. The poet, then,  who misunderstands the paganism of the Greeks, who does not desire to be  united to an absolute Perfection, who is sad by profession, cannot be,  according to my canons, a true poet. I speak, not as a critic, but as a  man who loves only the poetry that appeals to him.          CHAPTER III    CERTAIN NOVELISTS      My friendship with Thackeray and Dickens was an evolution rather than a  discovery. Once having read \"Vanity Fair\" or \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" the  book became not so much a book but a state of mind--and, as is sometimes  felt about a friend--it is hard to remember a time when we did not know  him!    Mark Twain was a discovery. \"The Jumping Frog of Calavaras\" and that  chuckling scene in \"Innocents Abroad,\" where the unhappy Italian guide  introduces Christopher Columbus to the American travellers, were joys  indeed. These were more delightful and satisfying than the kind of  humour that preceded them--they seemed better than the whimsicalities of  Artemus Ward, and not to be compared to the laboured humour of Mrs.  Partington. But, leaving out these amusing passages, my pleasure in the  works of Mark Twain faded more and more as I came to the age of reason,  which is somewhat over twenty-five. It was hard to laugh at Mark after a  time. Compared to him, the \"Pickwick Papers\" had an infinite variety.  There were other things in Dickens which were finer than anything in  \"Pickwick,\" but the humour of Pickwick had a softness about it, a human  interest, a lack of coarseness, which placed it immeasurably above that  of Mark Twain.    The greatest failure of Dickens was \"A Tale of Two Cities.\" And the  greatest failure of Mark Twain is his \"Joan of Arc.\" But Dickens  redeemed himself in a hundred ways, while Mark Twain sank deeper and  deeper into coarseness and pessimism. As Mark Twain is by all odds  apparently the national American author, it is heresy to say this; and I  know persons who have assumed an air of coldness as long as they could  in my presence, because I declined to look on \"Joan of Arc\" as a  masterpiece.    It shows some faults of Mark Twain's philosophy of life, it suggests his  narrow and materialistic point of view, and makes plain his lack of  knowledge of the perspectives of history. It is all the worse for an  appearance of tenderness. Mark Twain was neither mystical nor spiritual.  That does not mean that he was not a good husband and father, a kind  friend and a man very loyal to all his engagements. There are many other  authors who had not all these qualities, but who would have more easily  understood the character of Joan than did Mark Twain.    Dickens's failure in \"A Tale of Two Cities\" was from very different  causes. It was not through a failure of tenderness, a lack of an  understanding of the real pathos of life, or through the want of a  spirituality without which no great work can be effective. It was  because Dickens relied very largely on Carlyle for the foundation of his  study of the historical atmosphere of that novel--the best, from the  point of view of style, except \"Barnaby Rudge,\" that he ever wrote,  probably due to the fact that, treading as he did on ground that was new  to him, he had to guide his steps very carefully. The novel is  nevertheless a failure because it is untrue; it concerns itself with a  France that never existed seen through as artificial a medium as the  mauve tints through which certain artists see their figures and  landscapes. It was not with Dickens a case of defect in vision, but a  lack of knowledge. It was not lack of perception or the absence of a  great power of feeling. It was pure ignorance. He was without that  training which would have enabled him to go intelligently to the sources  of French history.    In Mark Twain's case it was not a lack of the power to reach the  sources; it was an inability to understand the character of the woman  whom he reverenced, so far as he could feel reverence, and an invincible  ignorance of the character of her time. Mark Twain was modern; but  modern in the vulgarest way. I know that \"Huckleberry Finn\" and the  other young Americans--whom our youth are expected to like, if not to  imitate--are looked on as sacred by the guardians of those libraries who  recommend typical books to eager juvenile readers. But let that pass for  the moment. To take a case in point, there is hardly any man or woman of  refinement who will hold a brief in defense of the vulgarity of \"A  Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.\"    It may be said that the average reader of Mark Twain's books--that is,  the average American reader--for Mark Twain is read the world  over--cares nothing for his philosophy of life. The average American  reads Mark Twain only to be amused, or to recall the adventures of a  time not far away when we were less sophisticated. Still, whether my  compatriots are in the habit of looking into books for a philosophy or  not, or of considering the faiths or unfaiths of the writer in hand, it  does not follow that it is to their credit if they neglect an analysis  which cultivated readers in other countries seldom omit.    If I thought that any words of mine would deprive anybody of the gaiety  which Mark Twain has added to life, I should not write these words; but  as this little volume is a book of impressions, and sincere impressions,  I may be frank in the full understanding that the average American  reader will not take seriously what I say of Mark Twain, since he has  become an integral part of American literature. There may perhaps come a  time when his works will be sold in sets, carefully arranged on all  self-respecting bookshelves, pointed to with pride as a proof of  culture, and never read. They will perhaps one day be the Rogers's  statuettes of literature. But that day is evidently far off. I do not  think that any jester of the older day--the day of Touchstone or of  Rigoletto, with a rooted sorrow in his heart, could have been more  pessimistic and more hopeless than Mark Twain. To change the words of  Autolycus--\"For the life to come, I jest out the thought of it!\"    \"You who admire Don Quixote,\" said an infuriated Mark Twainite, \"should  not talk of coarseness. There are pages in that romance of Cervantes  which I would not allow my son or daughter to read.\"    One should give both sides of an argument, and I give this other side to  show what may be said against my views. But the coarseness of Cervantes  is, after all, a healthy coarseness. Modern ideas of purity were not  his. Ignorance in those days--the days of Cervantes--did not mean  innocence. Even the fathers of the Church were quite willing to admit  that the roots of water lilies were in the mud, and there was no  conspiracy to conceal the existence of the mud. Mark Twain's coarseness,  however, is more than that of Cervantes or Shakespeare. Neither  Cervantes nor Shakespeare is ever irreverent.    To them, even the ordinary things of life have a certain sacerdotal  quality; but Mark Twain abhorred the sacerdotal quality as nature abhors  a vacuum. To say that he has affected the American spirit or the  American heart would be to go too far--for Americans are irreverent only  on the surface. It seems to me that they are the most reverent people in  the world toward those essential qualities which make up the spiritual  parts of life. Curiously enough, however, Mark Twain is just at present  the one author to whom all Europe and all outlanders point as the great  typical American writer!    That a delightful kind of American humour may exist without  exaggeration, or the necessity of debasing the moral currency, many  joyous books in our literature show. There are a few, of course, that  are joyous without self-consciousness; but for real joyousness and charm  and innocent gaiety, united to a knowledge of the psychology of the  American youth, none so far has equalled Booth Tarkington's \"Penrod,\"  or, what is better, \"Seventeen.\"    Now nobody has yet done anything so delightful, so mirth provoking, so  pathetic, in a way, as \"Seventeen.\" In my youth I was deprived of the  knowledge of this book, for when I swam into the tide of literature,  Booth Tarkington was in that world from which Wordsworth's boy came,  bringing rainbows, which moved to all the music of the spheres. It was  during the late war that \"Seventeen\" was cast on the coasts of Denmark,  at a time when American books scarcely reached those coasts at all. St.  Julian, the patron of merry travellers, must have guided it through the  maze and labyrinths of bombs and submarines in the North Sea. It arrived  just when the world seemed"]]]
