(#17)"],[1," herself, only consented to marry the \"very aged and sickly\" monarch on  condition that, if she survived him, she should be allowed to choose  her second husband herself. And she went on to declare, that  \"remembering the great virtue\" in him, she had, as Henry himself was  aware, \"always been of good mind to my Lord of Suffolk\".[184]                       [Footnote 178: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 582.]                       [Footnote 179: _L. and P._, i., 4953.]                       [Footnote 180: _L. and P._, i., 5203.]                       [Footnote 181: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 499, 500.]                       [Footnote 182: _Ibid._, ii., 511.]                       [Footnote 183: _L. and P._, i., 5470.]                       [Footnote 184: _Ibid._, ii., 227.]    She was probably fascinated less by Suffolk's virtue than by his bold  and handsome bearing. A bluff Englishman after the King's own heart,  he shared, as none else did, in Henry's love of the joust and tourney,  in his skill with the lance and the sword; he was the Hector of  combat, on foot and on horse, to Henry's Achilles. His father, plain  William Brandon, was Henry of Richmond's standard-bearer on Bosworth  field; and as such he had been singled out and killed in personal  (p. 080)  encounter by Richard III. His death gave his son a claim on the  gratitude of Henry VII. and Henry VIII.; and similarity of tastes  secured him rapid promotion at the young King's Court. Created Viscount  Lisle, he served in 1513 as marshal of Henry's army throughout his  campaign in France. With the King there were said to be \"two obstinate  men who governed everything\";[185] one was Wolsey, the other was Brandon.  In July he was offering his hand to Margaret of Savoy, who was  informed that Brandon was \"a second king,\" and that it would be well  to write him \"a kind letter, for it is he who does and undoes\".[186]  At Lille, in October, he continued his assault on Margaret as a relief  from the siege of Tournay; Henry favoured his suit, and when Margaret  called Brandon a _larron_ for stealing a ring from her finger, the  King was called in to help Brandon out with his French. Possibly it  was to smooth the course of his wooing that Brandon, early in 1514,  received an extraordinary advancement in rank. There was as yet only  one duke in England, but now Brandon was made Duke of Suffolk, at the  same time that the dukedom of Norfolk was restored to Surrey for his  victory at Flodden. Even a dukedom could barely make the son of a  simple esquire a match for an emperor's daughter, and the suit did not  prosper. Political reasons may have interfered. Suffolk, too, is  accused by the Venetian ambassador of having already had three  wives.[187] This seems to be an exaggeration, but the intricacy    (p. 081)  of the Duke's marital relationships, and the facility with which he  renounced them might well have served as a precedent to his master in  later years.                       [Footnote 185: _L. and P._, i., 4386.]                       [Footnote 186: _Ibid._, i., 4405.]                       [Footnote 187: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 464. He had made                     contracts with three different ladies, but had not                     actually married them all. See below, p. 199 and                     _D.N.B._, _s.v._ \"Brandon\".]    In January, 1515, the Duke was sent to Paris to condole with Francis  on Louis' death, to congratulate him on his own accession, and renew  the league with England. Before he set out, Henry made him promise  that he would not marry Mary until their return. But Suffolk was not  the man to resist the tears of a beautiful woman in trouble, and he  found Mary in sore distress. No sooner was Louis dead than his  lascivious successor became, as Mary said, \"importunate with her in  divers matters not to her honour,\" in suits \"the which,\" wrote Suffolk,  \"I and the Queen had rather be out of the world than abide\".[188]  Every evening Francis forced his attentions upon the beautiful  widow.[189] Nor was this the only trouble which threatened the lovers.  There were reports that the French would not let Mary go, but marry  her somewhere to serve their own political purposes.[190] Henry, too,  might want to betroth her again to Charles; Maximilian was urging this  course, and telling Margaret that Mary must be recovered for Charles,  even at the point of the sword.[191] Early in January, Wolsey had  written to her, warning her not to make any fresh promise of marriage.  Two friars from England, sent apparently by Suffolk's secret enemies,  told Mary the same tale, that if she returned to England she would  never be suffered to marry the Duke, but made to take Charles for her  husband, \"than which,\" she declared, \"I would rather be torn in    (p. 082)  pieces\".[192] Suffolk tried in vain to soothe her fears. She refused  to listen, and brought him to his knees with the announcement that  unless he would wed her there and then, she would continue to believe  that he had come only to entice her back to England and force her into  marriage with Charles. What was the poor Duke to do, between his  promise to Henry and the pleading of Mary? He did what every other man  with a heart in his breast and warm blood in his veins would have  done, he cast prudence to the winds and secretly married the woman he  loved.                       [Footnote 188: _L. and P._, ii., 134, 138, 163.]                       [Footnote 189: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 574.]                       [Footnote 190: _L. and P._, ii., 70, 85, 114.]                       [Footnote 191: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 594; _L. and P._,                     ii., 124.]                       [Footnote 192: _L. and P._, ii., 80, Suffolk to                     Henry VIII. This letter is placed under January in                     the _Calendar_, but it was obviously written about                     6th March, 1514-15.]    The news could not be long concealed, but unfortunately we have only  Wolsey's account of how it was received by Henry. He took it, wrote  the cardinal to Suffolk, \"grievously and displeasantly,\" not only on  account of the Duke's presumption, but of the breach of his promise to  Henry.[193] \"You are,\" he added, \"in the greatest danger man was ever  in;\" the council were calling for his ruin. To appease Henry and  enable the King to satisfy his council, Suffolk must induce Francis to  intervene in his favour, to pay Henry two hundred thousand crowns as  Mary's dowry, and to restore the plate and jewels she had received;  the Duke himself was to return the fortune with which Henry had endowed  his sister and pay twenty-four thousand pounds in yearly instalments  for the expenses of her marriage. Francis proved unexpectedly willing;  perhaps his better nature was touched by the lovers' distress. He also  saw that Mary's marriage with Suffolk prevented her being used as  (p. 083)  a link to bind Charles to Henry; and he may have thought that a  service to Suffolk would secure him a powerful friend at the English  Court, a calculation that was partly justified by the suspicion under  which Suffolk henceforth laboured, of being too partial to Francis.  Yet it was with heavy hearts that the couple left Paris in April and  wended their way towards Calais. Henry had given no sign; from Calais,  Mary wrote to him saying she would go to a nunnery rather than marry  against her desire.[194] Suffolk threw himself on the King's mercy;  all the council, he said, except Wolsey, were determined to put him to  death.[195] Secretly, against his promise, and without Henry's  consent, he had married the King's sister, an act the temerity of  which no one has since ventured to rival. He saw the executioner's axe  gleam before his eyes, and he trembled.                       [Footnote 193: _L. and P._, ii., 224.]                       [Footnote 194: _L. and P._, ii., 228.]                       [Footnote 195: _Ibid._, ii., 367.]    At Calais, Mary said she would stay until she heard from the King.[196]  His message has not been preserved, but fears were never more strangely  belied than when the pair crossed their Rubicon. So far from any attempt  being made to separate them, their marriage was publicly solemnised  before Henry and all his Court on 13th May, at Greenwich.[197] In  spite of all that happened, wrote the Venetian ambassador, Henry  retained his friendship for Suffolk;[198] and a few months later he  asserted, with some exaggeration, that the Duke's authority was  scarcely less than the King's.[199] He and Mary were indeed        (p. 084)  required to return all the endowment, whether in money, plate, jewels  or furniture, that she received on her marriage. But both she and the  Duke had agreed to these terms before their offence.[200] They were  not unreasonable. Henry's money had been laid out for political  purposes which could no longer be served; and Mary did not expect the  splendour, as Duchess of Suffolk, which she had enjoyed as Queen of  France. The only stipulation that looks like a punishment was the bond  to repay the cost of her journey to France; though not only was this  modified later on, but the Duke received numerous grants of land to  help to defray the charge. They were indeed required to live in the  country; but the Duke still came up to joust as of old with Henry on  great occasions, and Mary remained his favourite sister, to whose  issue, in preference to that of Margaret, he left the crown by will.  The vindictive suspicions which afterwards grew to rank luxuriance in  Henry's mind were scarcely budding as yet; his favour to Suffolk and  affection for Mary were proof against the intrigues in his Court. The  contrast was marked between the event and the terrors which Wolsey had  painted; and it is hard to believe that the Cardinal played an  entirely disinterested part in the matter.[201] It was obviously his  cue to exaggerate the King's anger, and to represent to the Duke that  its mitigation "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#17)"],[1,"    He never knew, any more than Shakespeare knew, that he had set a pace  that would never be equaled. He would have stood aghast with incredulity  had he been told that centuries would come and go and his name be  acclaimed as Master.    Such was Sebastian Bach--simple, polite, modest, unaffected, generous,  almost shy--doing his work and doing it as well as he could, living one  day at a time, loving his friends, forgetting his enemies. His heart was  filled with such melodies that their echo is a blessing and a  benediction to us yet. Art lives!           *       *       *       *       *    Heredity is that law of our being which provides that a man shall  resemble his grandfather--or not. The Bach family has supplied the  believers in heredity more good raw material in way of argument than any  dozen other families known to history, combined.    The Herschels with three eminent astronomers to their credit, or the  Beechers with half a dozen great preachers, are scarcely worth  mentioning when we remember the Bachs, who for two hundred fifty years  sounded the \"A\" for nearly all Germany.    The earliest known member of this musical family was Vert Bach, who was  born about Fifteen Hundred Fifty. He was a miller and baker by trade,  but devoted so much time to playing at dances, rehearsing at church  festivals, and attending gipsy musical performances, that in his milling  business he never prospered and nobody called him \"Pillsbury.\"    This man had a son by the name of Hans, a weaver and a right merry  wight, who traveled over the country attending weddings, christenings  and such like festivals, playing upon a fiddle of his own construction.  So famous was Hans Bach that his name lives in legend and folklore,  wherein it is related that often betimes when he arrived at a village,  the word would be passed and the whole population would quit work and  caper on the green. So luring was his fiddle, and so potent his voice in  song and story, that in a few instances preachers with long faces  warned their flocks against him; and once we find a country Dogberry had  his minions lay the innocent Hans by the heels and give him a taste of  the stocks, simply because he seduced a party of haymakers into  following him off to a dance at a tavern, and in the meantime a storm  coming up, the hay got wet. Poor Hans protested that he had nothing to  do with the storm, but his excuses were construed as proof of guilt and  went for naught.    At last in his wanderings, Hans found a buxom lass who was willing to  take him for better or worse.    And they were married and lived happily ever after, or fairly so.    This marriage quite sobered the fun-loving fiddler, so that he settled  down and worked at his weaving; and at odd hours made himself a bass  viol that looked to be father of all the fiddles. In Eisenach I was told  that this viol was ten feet high. Hans used to play this instrument at  the village church, and his playing drew such crowds that the preacher  had just cause for jealousy, and improved the opportunity, yet stifling  his rage he ordered the verger to lock the doors and allow no one to  depart until after the sermon and collection.    A goodly family was born to Hans and his worthy wife, and all were  trained in music, so that an orchestra was formed, made up of the  father, mother, and boys and girls. All the instruments used were made  by Hans, and these included marvelous fiddles, some with one string and  others with twenty; wooden wind-instruments like flutes, and drums to  match the players, some of whom were wee toddlers. It is said that the  music this orchestra made was more or less unique.    The best part of all this musical exploitation of Hans was that one of  his boys, Heinrich by name, applied himself so diligently to the art  that he became the organist in the village church, and then he was  called to play the great organ at Arnstadt. Heinrich was not a roisterer  like his father: he was a man of education and dignity. He composed many  pieces, and trained his choruses so well that his fame went abroad as  the chief musician of all Thuringia. He held his position at Arnstadt  for fifty years, and died in Sixteen Hundred Ninety-two, at which time  Johann Sebastian Bach, his nephew, was seven years old.    In his day Heinrich Bach was known as the \"Great Bach,\" and he had two  sons who were nearly as famous as himself, and would have been quite so,  were it not for the fact that they had a cousin by the name of Johann  Sebastian.    Johann Sebastian was a son of Johann Ambrosius, a brother of Heinrich,  and Johann Ambrosius, of course, a son of the merry Hans. Johann  Ambrosius was a musician, too, but did not distinguish himself  especially in this line. His distinction lies in the fact that he was  the father of Johann Sebastian, and this is quite enough for any one  man, even if Gail Hamilton did once protest that the office of male  parent was insignificant and devoid of honor.    Johann Ambrosius was a shiftless kind of fellow who drank much beer out  of an earthen pot, and whittled out fiddles, sitting on a bench in the  sun. He sort of let his family shift for themselves. Heinrich Bach, his  brother, used to speak of him as one of his \"poor relations,\" but at the  annual Bach family festival, when a full hundred Bachs gathered to sing  and play, Johann Ambrosius would attend and play on a flute or fiddle  and prove that he was worthy of the name.    On one such annual reunion he took his little boy, Johann Sebastian,  eight years old. The boy's mother had died a year or so before, and  after the mother's death the father seemed to think more of his children  than ever before--which is often the case, I'm told.    They walked the distance, about forty miles, in two days, to where the  festival occurred. It was one of the white milestones in the boy's  life--that trip with its revelation of sleeping in barns, singing, and  playing on many instruments, dining by the wayside, all winding up with  a solemn service at a great stone church, where the preacher gave them  his benediction, and the great company separated with handshakings,  embracings and tears, to meet again in a year. Johann Ambrosius did not  attend the next reunion. Before the Spring had come and birds sang  blithely, a band composed of twenty-five played funeral-dirges at his  grave--and little Johann Sebastian was an orphan.    Johann Sebastian's elder brother, Christoph, who had married a few years  before and moved away, attended the funeral, and when he went back home  he took little Johann Sebastian with him--there was no other place to  go. The lad was allowed to take one thing with him as a remembrance of  the home that he was now leaving forever--his father's violin in a green  bag, with a leathern drawstring. On the bag were his father's initials,  woven into the cloth by the boy's mother--a present from sweetheart to  lover before their marriage.    Christoph was a musician, too, and a prosperous fellow--quite the  antithesis of his father. It takes a lot of love to bring up a child,  and the miracle of mother-love is a constant wonder to every thinking  person. Without mother-love how would the cross-grained, perverse little  tyrant ever survive the buffets which the world is sure to give? It is  love that makes existence possible.    Christoph wished to be kind to his little brother, but it was a kindness  of the head and not of the heart. Only an hour a day was allowed the boy  for playing on the violin he had brought in the green bag, because  Christoph and his wife \"did not want to hear the noise.\" Then when the  boy stole off to the forest and played there, he was waylaid on the way  home and well cuffed for disobeying orders. All this seems very much  like the Goneril and Cordelia business, or the history of Cinderella,  but as Johann Sebastian told it himself in the after-years, we have  reason to believe it was not fiction.    Little Johann Sebastian had been his father's favorite, and this fact  perhaps made Christoph fear the boy was going to tread in his father's  lazy footsteps. So he set about to discipline the lad.    It must be admitted that Johann Ambrosius Bach, who whittled out fiddles  in the sun, and who drank much beer out of an earthen pot, was  shiftless, but it further seems that he was tender-hearted and kind and  took much interest in teaching Sebastian to play the violin, even while  the child wore dresses. And sometimes I think it is really better, if  you have to choose, to drink beer out of an earthen pot and be kind and  gentle, than to have a sharp nose for other folks' faults and be  continually trying to pinch and prod the old world into the straight and  narrow path of virtue. Yet there is wisdom in all folly, and I can see  that the prohibition concerning little Sebastian's playing the violin  only an hour a day--mind you! was not without its benefits. Surely it  would often be a wise bit of diplomacy on the part of the teacher to  order the pupil not to study his arithmetic lesson but an hour a day, on  penalty. Of course it might happen occasionally that the pupil in an  earnest desire to please, might not study at all, yet there are  exceptions to all rules, and we must remember that when Tom Sawyer  forbade the boys using his whitewash-brush, the scheme worked well.    One instance, however, might be cited where the law of compensation  seems really to have stood no chance. Christoph had a goodly musical  library and a collection of the best organ-music that had been produced  up to that time. He kept this music in a case, and carried the key to  the case in his pocket. On rare occasions he had shown bits of this  music to Sebastian, who read music like print when it is easy. The boy  devoured all the music he could lay his hands on, and hummed it over to  himself until every note and accent was fixed in his memory. He dearly  wanted to examine that music in the"]]]
