There were 483  oxen, 596 cows, 433 young cattle, and 26 horses; and the population was  1,950, of which 759 were males above sixteen, and 399 males under  sixteen, with 395 females above, and 399 under, the same age.    In this new colony there were 1,005 Presbyterians, 195 Roman Catholics,  173 Methodists, 167 of the Church of England, 67 Baptists, 8 Quakers.  The other sects or divisions were not enumerated with sufficient  accuracy to detail; and Owen's Sound, being as yet buried in the Bush,  cannot be visited by casual travellers, unless when an occasional  steamer plies from Penetanguishene. There is yet no post-office; but  1,500 newspapers and letters were received or sent in 1845; and two  flour-mills and two saw-mills are erected and in use. Three schooners of  a small class ply in summer to Penetanguishene. The village is at the  head of Owen's Sound, fifteen miles from Cape Croker, and is named  Sydenham, containing already thirty-six houses. Government gives 50  acres free, on condition of actual settlement, and that one third is  cleared and cropped in four years, when a deed is obtained: another  fifty is granted by paying 8s. an acre within three years, 9s. within  six years, 10s. an acre within nine years. The soil is good and climate  healthy.    North-north-west and north-east of Penetanguishene, all is wood, rock,  lake, river, and desert, in which, towards the French river, the  Nipissang Indian, the most degraded and helpless of the Red Men,  wanders, and obtains scanty food, for game is rare, although fish is  more plentiful.    An exploring expedition into this country was sent by Sir John Colborne,  in 1835, with a view of ascertaining its capabilities for settlement. An  officer of engineers, Captain Baddely, was the astronomer and geologist;  a naval officer the pilot; with surveyors and a hardy suite.    They left Lake Simcoe in the township of Rama from the Severn river,  and, going a short journey eastward, struck the division line of the  Home and the Newcastle districts, which commences between the townships  of Whitby and Darlington, on the shore of Lake Ontario, and runs a  little to the westward of north in a straight course, until it strikes  the south-east borders of Lake Nipissang, embracing more than two  degrees of latitude, not one half of which has ever been fully explored.    The plan adopted was to cut out this line, and diverge occasionally from  it to the right and left, until a great extent of unknown land on the  east, and the distance between it and Lake Huron, which contained a  large portion of the Chippewa Indian hunting-grounds, was thoroughly  surveyed.    In performing so very arduous a task, much privation and many obstacles  occurred--forests, swamps, rivers, lakes, rocky ridges--all had to be  passed.    To the eastward of the main line, and for some distance to the westward,  good land appeared; and, as the agricultural probe was freely used,  chance was not permitted to sway. The agricultural probe is an  instrument which I first saw slung over my friend Baddely's shoulders,  and of his invention. It is a sort of huge screw gimblet, or auger,  which readily penetrates the ground by being worked with a long  cross-handle, and brings up the subsoil in a groove to a considerable  depth. Specimens of the soil and of rocks and minerals were collected,  and a plan was adopted which is a useful lesson to future explorers. A  small piece of linen or cotton, about four inches square, had two pieces  of twine sewed on opposite corners, and the cloth was marked in  printers' ink, from stamps, with figures from 1 to 500. A knapsack was  provided, and the specimens were reduced to a size small enough to be  carefully tied up in one of these numbered square cloths; and, as the  specimens were collected, they were entered in the journal as to number  and locality, strata, dip, and appearance. Thus a vast number of small  specimens could be brought on a man's back, and examined at leisure.    The toils, however, of such a journey in the vast and untrodden  wilderness are very severe, and the privations greater. For, in this  tract, on the side next to Lake Huron, there was an absence of game  which scarcely ever occurs in the forest near the great lakes. With ice  forming and snow commencing, and with every prospect of being frozen in,  a portion of the explorers missed their supplies, and subsisted for  three whole days and nights on almost nothing; a putrid deer's liver,  hanging on a bush near a recent Indian trail, was all the animal food  they had found; but this even hunger could scarcely tempt them to cook.  I was exploring in a more civilized country near them; but even there  our Indian guide was at fault, and, from want of proper precaution, our  provision failed. A small fish amongst four or five persons was one  day's luxury.    The Nipissang Indians, a very degraded and wretched tribe, live in this  desolate region, and, it is said, have sometimes been so reduced for  want of game as to resort to cannibalism. We heard that they had  recently been obliged to resort to this practice. I was directed, with  my friends, to conciliate these people, and to assure them that the  British government, so far from intending to injure them by an  examination of their country, desired only to ameliorate their sad  condition.[3]    [Footnote 3: Some time afterwards, during the period in which Lord  Glenelg held the Colonial Office, I was appointed to report upon the  state and condition of the Indians of Canada, by his lordship, without  my knowledge or solicitation; this was never communicated to me by the  then Lieut.-Governor of Upper Canada, and I only knew of it last year,  by accidentally reading a report on the subject made by order of the  House of Assembly, after I left Canada. I do not know if his lordship  will ever read this work, or the gentleman to whom I believe I was  indebted for the intended kindness; and, if either should, I beg to  tender my thanks thus publicly.]    We had a council. The astronomer royal, who was also the geologist, was  a fine, portly fellow, whose bodily proportions would make three such  carcases as that which I rejoice in. The nation sat in council and the  Talk was held. Grim old savages, filthy and forbidding, half-starved  warriors, hideous to the eye, sat in large circle, with the two great  Red Fathers, as they called my friend and myself, on account of our  scarlet jackets. The pipe passed from hand to hand and from mouth to  mouth, and many a solemn whiff ascended in curling clouds: all was  solemn and sad.    The speech was made and answered with an acuteness which we were not  prepared for. But our explanation and mission were at length received,  and the pledge of peace, the wampum-belts, were accepted and worn by the  aged chiefs. My friend jogged my elbow once or twice, and thought they  were eyeing him suspiciously, for he was to proceed into their country.  He looked so fat and so healthy, that he thought their greasy mouths  watered for a roasted slice of so fine a subject!    But the wampum pledge is never broken, and we had smoked the calumet of  friendship. Thus, although he luxuriated, after a total abstinence of  three days, on the sight of a decayed deer's liver, which he could not  be prevailed upon to partake of, yet the Nipissang, starving as he must  also have been, never fried my friend, nor feasted on his fatness.    This is not the only good story to be told of Penetanguishene; for the  American press of the frontier, with its accustomed adherence to truth,  discovered a mare's nest there lately, and stated that the British  government kept enormous supplies of naval stores, several  steam-vessels, a depot of coal, and everything necessary for the  equipment of a large war fleet on Lake Huron, at this little outpost of  the West, and that a tremendous force of mounted cavaliers were always  ready to embark on board of it at all times.    There are now certainly a good many horses at the village, whereas, in  1837, perhaps one might have found out a dozen by great research there:  as for cavalry, unless Brother Jonathan can manufacture it as cheaply  and as lucratively as he does wooden clocks or nutmegs, it would be  somewhat difficult to _raise_ it at Penetanguishene.    The village is a small, rambling place, with a little Roman Catholic  church and a storehouse or general shop or two, about which, in summer,  you always see idle Indians playing at some game or other, or else  smoking with as idle villagers.    The garrison is three miles from the village, and is always called \"The  Establishment;\" and in the forest between the two places is a new  church, built of wood, very small, but sufficient for the Established  Church, as it is sometimes called, of that portion of Canada. A  clergyman is constantly stationed here for the army, navy, and  civilians, and near the church is a collection of log huts, which I  placed there some years ago by order of Lord Seaton, with small plots of  ground attached to each as a refuge for destitute soldiers who had  commuted their pensions.    This Chelsea in miniature flourished for a time, and drained the streets  of the large towns of Canada of the miserable objects; but, such was the  improvidence of most of these settlers and such their broken  constitutions, that, on my present visit, I found but one old serjeant  left, and he was on the point of moving.    The commutation of pensions was an experiment of the most benevolent  intention. It was thought that the married pensioner would purchase  stock for a small farm, and set himself down to provide for his children  with a sum of money in hand which he could never have obtained in any  other way. Many did so, and are now independent; but the majority,  helpless in their habits, and giving way to drink, soon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#17)"],[1,"support her, and proposed to      dismiss her Ministers; she had, however, been misled as to the      popular aid forthcoming, and had to give up the struggle, Sa      da Bandeira becoming Prime Minister.

The Princess's own feelings, and those of her mother, do not      seem to have been considered.

I have begun since a few days Lord Clive's  Life, by Sir John Malcolm,[20] which is very interesting, as it gives  much insight into the affairs of India, over parts of which, I fear,  it would be well to throw a _veil_. I am reading it by myself, _et je  vous le recommande_....        [Footnote 20: The book reviewed by Macaulay, who spoke of      Sir John Malcolm as one whose \"love passes the love of      biographers, and who can see nothing but wisdom and justice in      the actions of his idol.\"]          INTRODUCTORY NOTE    TO CHAPTER VI      The closing months of the reign of William IV. were not marked by any  stirring events at home. The Conservative opposition to the Melbourne  Ministry was strengthened before the meeting of Parliament by a great  speech by Sir Robert Peel at Glasgow, and Lord Brougham later on  emerged from his retirement to become the able and venomous critic of  his former friends. The Government failed to carry important measures  on Church Rates and Irish Municipal Corporations, while the Radical  group pressed persistently their favourite motions in support of  the Ballot, and against the Property qualification of members,  Primogeniture, the Septennial Act, the Bishops' seats and Proxy Voting  in the House of Lords. The Ministry was saved from shipwreck by the  demise of the Crown and by the accession of the Princess Victoria,  who, on attaining her legal majority a month earlier, had received  marked signs of enthusiastic popular favour.    The General Election in the Autumn did not materially affect the  position of parties, the Radicals losing and O'Connell gaining  seats; but the prestige of Lord Melbourne was increased by the unique  position he now held in reference to the Sovereign. Parliament was  opened in person by the Queen on 20th November, and the Civil List  dealt with, the amount allocated being L385,000 as against L510,000 in  the late reign (of which L75,000, formerly paid in pensions, was now  struck off, and other arrangements made).    For some time past the state of Canada had caused grave anxiety. By  an Act of 1791, it had been divided into Upper and Lower Canada, each  with a Governor, Council, and House of Representatives, Lower Canada  being in the main French, while Upper Canada was occupied by British  settlers. Friction first arose in the former, between the nominee  Council and the popular Assembly, the Assembly declining to pay the  salaries of officials whom they had censured, but whom the Executive  had retained in their posts. Mr Papineau, who had been Speaker of  the Assembly, was leader in the popular movement. Lord Gosford, the  Governor of Lower Canada, dismissed some Militia officers who had  taken part in political demonstrations, and warrants were issued for  the apprehension of certain members of the Assembly, on the charge  of high treason: within a short time the discontented party broke out  into rebellion. The course which events would take in Upper Canada  was for a time doubtful. Sir Francis Head, the Governor, placed his  regular troops at the service of Lord Gosford, preferring to rely on  the militia. This unusual action was successful, but was not approved  by the Colonial Office. The state of affairs became very alarming at  the close of the year, when it was announced in Parliament that Lord  Gosford had resigned and that Sir John Colborne (afterwards Lord  Seaton) had been appointed to succeed him.    In France the confederates of Louis Napoleon in the Strasburg outbreak  were tried and acquitted; a treaty was concluded at Tafna with  Abd-el-Kader, but negotiations for a similar agreement with Achmet Bey  were less successful, and operations were continued against Constantin  with successful results, the town being carried by an assault on 13th  October, with some loss of officers and men on the French side.    Affairs continued unsettled in the Peninsula. In Spain General Evans  was defeated near San Sebastian, but afterwards, in conjunction with  Lord John Hay, captured Irun, the frontier town. Don Carlos  meanwhile marched on Madrid, but was encountered by Espartero,  Commander-in-Chief of the Christinos, who was Prime Minister for a  brief period during the year. The British legion was dissolved, and  Evans returned to England.    In Portugal the English were becoming unpopular for their supposed  intervention: Ferdinand, the Queen's consort, who was naturally  believed to be in harmony with the British Cabinet, acted tactlessly  in accepting the Commandership-in-Chief, and internal hostilities  continued throughout the year.    In Hanover a reactionary step was taken by King Ernest, who had  succeeded his brother, William IV. of England, on the throne of  Hanover; by letters patent he abrogated the Constitution of 1833, an  action which, imperfect and open to criticism though the Constitution  was, naturally aroused anxiety among the supporters of representative  institutions throughout Europe.          CHAPTER VI    1837          _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _16th January 1837._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... We saw Van de Weyer[1] on Tuesday, and his  conversation was most interesting. He praises our dear Ferdinand  most exceedingly, but as for the poor Queen, what he told us does not  redound much to her credit; one good quality, however, she has, which  is her excessive fondness for and real _obedience_ to Ferdinand. She  is unfortunately surrounded by a _camarilla_[2] who poison her ears,  and fetter all her actions; poor soul! she is _much_ to be pitied.  About Lavradio[3] you will also have, I fear, heard but too much.  Honesty and single-heartedness seems to have left Portugal. Van de  Weyer is so clear in all that he says, so sensible, so quiet, so  clever, and, last but not least, so agreeable; I hope we shall soon  see him again. You see, dear Uncle, how much interest I take in  Portugal; but I must say that I think every one who knows dear  Ferdinand, and particularly who loves him as I do, must feel a very  deep interest as to the fate of the unhappy country in which he is  destined to play so prominent and difficult a part.    I have been reading to-day a very clever speech of Sir Robert Peel's  (not a political one) to the University at Glasgow, on the occasion of  his being elected Lord Rector of that college. There is another speech  of his at the dinner at Glasgow which _is political_, but which I have  not yet read....[4]        [Footnote 1: Sylvain Van de Weyer (b. 1802) was, in 1830,      Belgian Plenipotentiary at the Conference of London. He      returned to his own country and became Foreign Minister.      His exertions contributed greatly to render successful the      candidature of Prince Leopold for the throne of Belgium. The      King appointed him Belgian Minister in London, to which post      he returned in 1851, and held it till 1867. He was treated by      the Queen until his death in 1874 as a very intimate friend      and adviser.]        [Footnote 2: _I.e._ a clique.]        [Footnote 3: The Portuguese Statesman who had gone to Gotha      to arrange the Queen's marriage, and was destined to act in a      similar manner for her son in 1857.]        [Footnote 4: Sir R. Peel was installed as Lord Rector of      Glasgow on 11th January, and delivered an address on the      principles of Education: strong political feeling was      manifested, groans being given for Lord Melbourne and the      Ministry. At a civic banquet given in Sir R. Peel's honour, he      expounded the principles of Conservative Reform.]          [Pageheading: SPAIN AND PORTUGAL]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    _23rd January 1837._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,-- ... The affairs of the Peninsula are indeed very  distressing,[5] and what you tell me in your letter of the 20th, as  also in the former one, is highly interesting and, alas! but too true.  I trust, not withstanding what you say, I may yet live to see Spain  and Portugal settled. But I greatly fear that the time is far distant.    Do you know Mendizabal?[6] I saw him at our house in 1835. Alava[7]  presented him to us; he is a tall, dark, fine, and clever-looking man.  I remember his being so much struck with my likeness to Donna Maria,  which I was not aware was the case. Pray, dear Uncle, may I"]]]
