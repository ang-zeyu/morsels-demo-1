He was now prepared to stand by the Queen, all other considerations  he had thrown aside, he would undertake to deal with the difficulties,  and should have to go down alone to the House of Commons. He had  written to his colleagues that he would serve the Queen if she called  upon him to do so, that he expected them to meet him at nine o'clock  that evening, and that he would tell them what he meant to do. Those  who would not go with him, he would dismiss at once. He did not wish  to avail himself of any undue advantage, and therefore would not  advise an Order in Council, but go at once to Parliament, laying his  measure before it: \"Reject it, if you please; there it is!\"    He called the crisis an alarming one, which determination alone could  overcome.    We showed him Lord John Russell's statement, with which he declared  himself very much satisfied. He advised the Queen to write a letter  to Lord John, announcing to him Sir Robert's consent to go on with the  Government, and wrote a draft of it, which follows here.    He had heard strange instances of disagreement amongst the men whom  Lord John had assembled in town.    Sir Robert seemed throughout much moved, and said with much warmth:  \"There is no sacrifice that I will not make for your Majesty, except  that of my honour.\"          _Queen Victoria to Lord John Russell._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _20th December 1845._    Sir Robert Peel has just been here. He expressed great regret that  Lord John Russell had felt it necessary to decline the formation of a  Government.    He said he should have acted towards Lord John Russell with the most  scrupulous good faith, and that he should have done everything in his  power to give Lord John support.    He thinks many would have been induced to follow his example.    Sir Robert Peel did not hesitate a moment in withdrawing his offer of  resignation. He said he felt it his duty at once to resume his office,  though he is deeply sensible of the difficulties with which he has to  contend.          [Pageheading: PEEL CORDIALLY SUPPORTED]      _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    WHITEHALL, _21st December 1845._    Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and proceeds  to give your Majesty an account of what has passed since he left your  Majesty at four o'clock yesterday.    The Cabinet met at Sir Robert Peel's house in Downing Street at  half-past nine.    Sir Robert Peel informed them that he had not summoned them for the  purpose of deliberating on what was to be done, but for the purpose  of announcing to them that he was your Majesty's Minister, and whether  supported or not, was firmly resolved to meet Parliament as your  Majesty's Minister, and to propose such measures as the public  exigencies required.    Failure or success must depend upon their decision, but nothing could  shake Sir Robert Peel's determination to meet Parliament and to advise  the Speech from the Throne.    There was a dead silence, at length interrupted by Lord Stanley's  declaring that he must persevere in resigning, that he thought the  Corn Law ought to be adhered to, and might have been maintained.    The Duke of Wellington said he thought the Corn Law was a subordinate  consideration. He was _delighted_ when he received Sir Robert Peel's  letter that day, announcing to the Duke that his mind was made up to  place his services at your Majesty's disposal.    The Duke of Buccleuch behaved admirably--was much agitated--thought  new circumstances had arisen--would not then decide on resigning.    Sir Robert Peel has received this morning the enclosed note from the  Duke.[39]    He has written a reply very strongly to the Duke, stating that the  present question is not one of Corn Law, but whether your Majesty's  former servants or Lord Grey and Mr Cobden shall constitute your  Majesty's Government. Sir Robert Peel defied the wit of man to suggest  now another alternative to your Majesty.    Lord Aberdeen will see the Duke to-day.    All the other members of the Government cordially approved of Sir  Robert Peel's determination not to abandon your Majesty's service.    There was no question about details, but if there is any, it shall not  alter Sir Robert Peel's course.        [Footnote 39: _See_ next letter.]          _The Duke of Buccleuch to Sir Robert Peel._    MONTAGU HOUSE, _20th December 1845._    MY DEAR SIR ROBERT,--That which has occurred this evening, and that  which you have communicated to us, the very critical state in which  the country now is, and above all the duty which I owe to her Majesty  under the present circumstances, has made a most strong impression  upon my mind. At the risk, therefore, of imputation of vacillation  or of any other motive by others, may I ask of you to give me a few  hours' time for further reflection, before finally deciding upon the  course which I may feel it to be my duty to pursue? Believe me, my  dear Sir Robert, yours most sincerely,    BUCCLEUCH.          _Sir Robert Peel to Queen Victoria._    WHITEHALL, _22nd December 1845._    Sir Robert Peel presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and has the  utmost satisfaction in informing your Majesty that Mr Gladstone is  willing to accept the Seals of the Colonial Office should your Majesty  be pleased to confide them to him.[40]    Sir Robert Peel thinks this of great importance, and that immediate  decision in filling up so eminent a post will have a good effect.        [Footnote 40: Mr Gladstone, by accepting office, vacated the      seat at Newark which he had held through the influence of the      Protectionist Duke of Newcastle. He did not seek re-election,      and though a Secretary of State, remained without a seat in      Parliament.]          [Pageheading: THE QUEEN'S ESTIMATE OF PEEL]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _23rd December 1845._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Many thanks for your two kind letters of the  17th and 19th, which gave me much pleasure. I have little to add to  Albert's letter of yesterday, except my _extreme_ admiration of  our worthy Peel, who shows himself a man of unbounded _loyalty_,  _courage_, patriotism, and _high-mindedness_, and his conduct towards  me has been _chivalrous_ almost, I might say. I never have seen him  so excited or so determined, and _such_ a good cause must succeed. We  have indeed had an escape, for though Lord John's _own notions_ were  _very_ good and moderate, he let himself be entirely twisted and  twirled about by his _violent_ friends, and _all_ the moderate ones  were crushed....    VICTORIA R.          _Sir Robert Peel to the Prince Albert._    WHITEHALL, _23rd December 1845._    SIR,--I think Her Majesty and your Royal Highness will have been  pleased with the progress I have made in execution of the great trust  again committed to me by Her Majesty.    It will be of great importance to conciliate Lord Stanley's support  out of office, to induce him to _discourage_ hostile combinations.    I would humbly recommend Her Majesty, when Her Majesty sees Lord  Stanley to-day, to receive him with her usual kindness, to say that I  had done full justice in my reports to Her Majesty to the motives by  which he had been actuated, and to the openness and frankness of his  conduct, to regret greatly the loss of his services, but to hope  that he might be still enabled not to oppose and even to promote  the accomplishment of what cannot now be safely resisted. I have the  honour to be, etc., etc., etc.,    ROBERT PEEL.          [Pageheading: THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS]    [Pageheading: THE CORN LAWS]    [Pageheading: THE UNEMPLOYED]      _Memorandum by the Prince Albert._    WINDSOR CASTLE, _25th December 1845._    We had a Council yesterday, at which Parliament was prorogued to  the 22nd of January, then to meet for the despatch of business. Lord  Stanley had an audience of the Queen before, and delivered up the  Seals of his office. He was much agitated, and had told Sir Robert  that he dreaded this interview very much. The Queen thanked him for  his services, and begged he would do his best out of office to smooth  down the difficulties her Government would have to contend with. At  the Council Lord Dalhousie took his seat, and Mr Gladstone received  the Colonial Seals. The Queen saw the Duke of Buccleuch and  thanked him for the devotion he had shown her during these trying  circumstances; the same to the Duke of Wellington, who is in excellent  spirits. On my saying, \"You have such an influence over the House  of Lords, that you will be able to keep them straight,\" he answered:  \"I'll do anything; I am now beginning to write to them and to convince  them singly of what their duty is.\"    We saw afterwards Sir Robert Peel, who stayed more than three hours.  He is in the highest spirits at having got Mr Gladstone and kept the  Duke of Buccleuch; he proposed that the Duke should be made President,  and Lord Haddington Privy Seal in his stead. (Lord Haddington had  behaved very well, had given up his place to Sir Robert, and told him  he should do with him just as he liked--leave him out of the Cabinet,  shift him to another place, or leave him at the Admiralty, as would  suit him best.)    Sir Robert hinted to Lord Ripon that Lord Haddington had behaved so  well, but got no more out of him, but \"that he would _almost_ have  done the same.\" Sir Robert proposes to see Lord Ellenborough in order  to offer him the Admiralty, received the Queen's sanction likewise to  Lord St Germans (the Postmaster-General) being put into the Cabinet. I  said: \"With your Government that has no inconvenience, and even if you  had a hundred members in the Cabinet, as you don't tell them but  what is absolutely necessary, and follow your own course.\" He said in  reply, that he should be very sorry if he had to have told his  Cabinet that he meant to send "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24790"],[0,"Early English Meals and Manners (#17)"],[1," lowe wordes.

Sk.]        [Headnote: EDUCATION OF FIELD LABOURERS.]    There is one side of the picture, the workman's son turned monk, and  clerk to a lord. Let us turn to the other side, the ploughman's son who  didn't turn monk, whose head _was_ 'shet' in the straw, who delved and  ditched, and dunged the earth, eat bread of corn and bran, worts  fleshless (vegetables, but no meat), drank water, and went miserably  (_Crede_, l. 1565-71). What education did he get? To whom could he be  apprenticed? What was his chance in life? Let the Statute-Book answer:--        A.D. 1388. 12º Rich. II., Cap. v.      _Item._ It is ordained & assented, That he or she which used to    labour at the Plough and Cart, or other Labour or Service of    Husbandry _till they be of the Age of Twelve Years, that from    thenceforth they shall abide at the same Labour_, without being    put to any Mystery or Handicraft; and if any Covenant or Bond of    Apprentie (_so_) be from henceforth made to the Contrary, the same    shall be holden for none.        A.D. 1405-6. 7º Henri IV., Cap. xvii.      .....And Whereas in the Statutes made at Canterbury among other    Articles it is contained That he or she that useth to labour at    the Plough or Cart, or other Labour or Service of Husbandry, till    he be of the age of Twelve Years, that from the same time forth he    shall abide at the same Labour, without being put to any Mystery    or Handicraft; and if any Covenant or Bond be made from that time    forth to the contrary, it shall be holden for none:    Notwithstanding which Article, and the good Statutes afore made    through all parts of the Realm, the Infants born within the Towns    and Seignories of Upland, whose Fathers & Mothers have no Land nor    Rent nor other Living, but only their Service or Mystery, be put    by their said Fathers and Mothers and other their Friends to    serve, and bound Apprentices, to divers Crafts within the Cities    and Boroughs of the said Realm _sometime at the Age of Twelve    Years, sometime within the said Age_, and that for the Pride of    Clothing and other evil Customs that Servants do use in the same;    so that there is so great Scarcity of Labourers and other Servants    of Husbandry _that the Gentlemen and other People of the Realm be    greatly impoverished for the Cause aforesaid:_ Our Sovereign Lord    the King considering the said Mischief, and willing thereupon to    provide Remedy, by the advice & assent of the Lords Spiritual and    Temporal, and at the request of the said Commons, hath ordained    and stablished, That no Man nor Woman, of what Estate or Condition    they be, shall put their Son or Daughter, of whatsoever Age he or    she be, to Serve as Apprentice to no Craft nor other Labour within    any City or Borough in the Realm, except he have Land or Rent to    the Value of Twenty Shillings by the Year at the least, but they    shall be put to other labours as their Estates doth require, upon    Pain of one Year's Imprisonment, and to make Fine and Ransom at    the King's Will. And if any Covenant be made of any such Infant,    of what Estate that he be, to the contrary, it shall be holden for    none. Provided Always, that every Man and Woman, of what Estate or    Condition that he be, shall be free to set their Son or Daughter    to take Learning at any manner School that pleaseth them within    the Realm.    A most gracious saving clause truly, for those children who were used to  labour at the plough and cart till they were twelve years old[67]. Let  us hope that some got the benefit of it!    These Acts I came across when hunting for the Statutes referred to by  the _Boke of Curtasye_ as fixing the hire of horses for carriage at  fourpence a piece, and they caused me some surprise. They made me wonder  less at the energy with which some people now are striving to erect  \"barriers against democracy\" to prevent the return match for the old  game coming off.--However improving, and however justly retributive,  future legislation for the rich by the poor in the spirit of past  legislation for the poor by the rich might be, it could hardly be  considered pleasant, and is surely worth putting up the true barrier  against, one of education in each poor man's mind. (He who americanizes  us thus far will be the greatest benefactor England has had for some  ages.)--These Statutes also made me think how the old spirit still  lingers in England, how a friend of my own was curate in a Surrey  village where the kind-hearted squire would allow none of the R's but  Reading to be taught in his school; how another clergyman lately  reported his Farmers' meeting on the school question: Reading and  Writing might be taught, but Arithmetic not; the boys would be getting  to know too much about wages, and that would be troublesome; how,  lastly, our gangs of children working on our Eastern-counties farms, and  our bird-keeping boys of the whole South, can almost match the children  of the agricultural labourer of 1388.        [Headnote: NO BONDSMAN'S SON TO BE AN APPRENTICE.]    The early practice of the Freemasons, and other crafts, refusing to let  any member take a bondsman's son as an apprentice, was founded on the  reasonable apprehension that his lord would or might afterwards claim  the lad, make him disclose the trade-secrets, and carry on his art for  the lord's benefit. The fourth of the 'Fyftene artyculus or fyftene  poyntus' of the Freemasons, printed by Mr Halliwell (p. 16), is on this  subject.      _Articulus quartus_ (MS. Bibl. Reg. 17 A, Art. I., fol. 3, &c.)        The fowrthe artycul thys moste be,      That the mayster hym wel be-se      That he _no bondemon_ prentys make,      Ny for no covetyse do hym take;      For the lord that he ys bond to,      May fache the prentes whersever he go.

[Headnote: POST-REFORMATION CATHEDRAL SCHOOLS.]    _Cathedral Schools._ About the pre-Reformation Schools I can find only  the extract from Tanner given above, p. xlii. On the post-Reformation  Schools I refer readers to Mr Whiston's _Cathedral Trusts_, 1850. He  says:      \"The Cathedrals of England are of two kinds, those of the old and    those of the new foundation: of the latter, Canterbury (the old    archiepiscopal see) and Carlisle, Durham, Ely, Norwich, Rochester,    and Worcester, old episcopal sees, were A.D. 1541-2 refounded, or    rather reformed, by Henry VIII. ... Besides these, he created five    other cathedral churches or colleges, in connexion with the five    new episcopal sees of Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, and    Peterborough. He further created the see of Westminster, which was    ... subsequently (A.D. 1560) converted to a deanery collegiate by    Queen Elizabeth ... (p. 6). The preamble of the Act 31 Henry VIII.    c. 9, for founding the new cathedrals, preserved in Henry's own    handwriting, recites that they were established 'To the intente    that Gods worde myght the better be sett forthe, _cyldren broght    up in lernynge, clerces nuryshyd in the universities_, olde    servantes decayed, to have lyfing, allmes housys for pour folke to    be sustayned in, _Reders of grece, ebrew, and latyne to have good    stypende_, dayly almes to be mynistrate, mending of hyght wayes,    and exhybision for mynisters of the chyrche.'\"    \"A general idea of the scope and nature of the cathedral establishments,  as originally planned and settled by Henry VIII., may be formed from  the first chapter of the old statutes of Canterbury, which is almost  identical with the corresponding chapter of the statutes of all the  other cathedrals of the new foundation. It is as follows:      \"On[68] the entire number of those who have their sustentation    (qui sustentantur) in the cathedral and"]]]
