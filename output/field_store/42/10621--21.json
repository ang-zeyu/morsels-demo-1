He was an imprompju  citizen!    \"Once I was in the Lucy Holmes,\" said Manuel, in his gentle voice.  \"They not want any of her feesh in Gloucester. Eh, wha-at? Give us no  price. So we go across the water, and think to sell to some Fayal man.  Then it blow fresh, and we cannot see well. Eh, wha-at? Then it blow  some more fresh, and we go down below and drive very fast--no one know  where. By-and-by we see a land, and it get some hot. Then come two,  three nigger in a brick. Eh, wha-at? We ask where we are, and they  say--now, what you all think?\"    \"Grand Canary,\" said Disko, after a moment. Manuel shook his head,  smiling.    \"Blanco,\" said Tom Platt.    \"No. Worse than that. We was below Bezagos, and the brick she was from  Liberia! So we sell our feesh there! Not bad, so? Eh, wha-at?\"    \"Can a schooner like this go right across to Africa?\" said Harvey.    \"Go araound the Horn ef there's anythin' worth goin' fer, and the grub  holds aout,\" said Disko. \"My father he run his packet, an' she was a  kind o' pinkey, abaout fifty ton, I guess,--the Rupert,--he run her  over to Greenland's icy mountains the year ha'af our fleet was tryin'  after cod there. An' what's more, he took my mother along with him,--to  show her haow the money was earned, I presoom,--an' they was all iced  up, an' I was born at Disko. Don't remember nothin' abaout it, o'  course. We come back when the ice eased in the spring, but they named  me fer the place. Kinder mean trick to put up on a baby, but we're all  baound to make mistakes in aour lives.\"    \"Sure! Sure!\" said Salters, wagging his head. \"All baound to make  mistakes, an' I tell you two boys here thet after you've made a  mistake--ye don't make fewer'n a hundred a day--the next best thing's  to own up to it like men.\"    Long Jack winked one tremendous wink that embraced all hands except  Disko and Salters, and the incident was closed.    Then they made berth after berth to the northward, the dories out  almost every day, running along the east edge of the Grand Bank in  thirty-to forty-fathom water, and fishing steadily.    It was here Harvey first met the squid, who is one of the best  cod-baits, but uncertain in his moods. They were waked out of their  bunks one black night by yells of \"Squid O!\" from Salters, and for an  hour and a half every soul aboard hung over his squid-jig--a piece of  lead painted red and armed at the lower end with a circle of pins bent  backward like half-opened umbrella ribs. The squid--for some unknown  reason--likes, and wraps himself round, this thing, and is hauled up  ere he can escape from the pins. But as he leaves his home he squirts  first water and next ink into his captor's face; and it was curious to  see the men weaving their heads from side to side to dodge the shot.  They were as black as sweeps when the flurry ended; but a pile of fresh  squid lay on the deck, and the large cod thinks very well of a little  shiny piece of squid-tentacle at the tip of a clam-baited hook. Next  day they caught many fish, and met the Carrie Pitman, to whom they  shouted their luck, and she wanted to trade--seven cod for one  fair-sized squid; but Disko would not agree at the price, and the  Carrie dropped sullenly to leeward and anchored half a mile away, in  the hope of striking on to some for herself.    Disko said nothing till after supper, when he sent Dan and Manuel out  to buoy the \"We're Here's\" cable and announced his intention of turning  in with the broad-axe. Dan naturally repeated these remarks to a dory  from the Carrie, who wanted to know why they were buoying their cable,  since they were not on rocky bottom.    \"Dad sez he wouldn't trust a ferryboat within five mile o' you,\" Dan  howled cheerfully.    \"Why don't he git out, then'? Who's hinderin'?\" said the other.    \"Cause you've jest the same ez lee-bowed him, an' he don't take that  from any boat, not to speak o' sech a driftin' gurry-butt as you be.\"    \"She ain't driftin' any this trip,\" said the man, angrily, for the  Carrie Pitman had an unsavoury reputation for breaking her  ground-tackle.    \"Then haow d'you make berths?\" said Dan. \"It's her best p'int o'  sailin'. An' ef she's quit driftin', what in thunder are you doin' with  a new jib-boom?\" That shot went home.    \"Hey, you Portugoosy organ-grinder, take your monkey back to  Gloucester. Go back to school, Dan Troop,\" was the answer.    \"O-ver-alls! O-ver-alls!\" yelled Dan, who knew that one of the Carrie's  crew had worked in an overall factory the winter before.    \"Shrimp! Gloucester shrimp! Git aout, you Novy!\"    To call a Gloucester man a Nova Scotian is not well received. Dan  answered in kind.    \"Novy yourself, ye Scrabble-towners! ye Chatham wreckers' Git aout with  your brick in your stock in'!\" And the forces separated, but Chatham  had the worst of it.    \"I knew haow 'twould be,\" said Disko. \"She's drawed the wind raound  already. Some one oughter put a deesist on thet packet. She'll snore  till midnight, an' jest when we're gittin' our sleep she'll strike  adrift. Good job we ain't crowded with craft hereaways. But I ain't  goin' to up anchor fer Chatham. She may hold.\"    The wind, which had hauled round, rose at sundown and blew steadily.  There was not enough sea, though, to disturb even a dory's tackle, but  the Carrie Pitman was a law unto herself. At the end of the boys' watch  they heard the crack-crack-crack of a huge muzzle-loading revolver  aboard her.    \"Glory, glory, hallelujah!\" sung Dan. \"Here she comes, dad; butt-end  first, walkin' in her sleep same's she done on 'Queereau.\"    Had she been any other boat Disko would have taken his chances, but now  he cut the cable as the Carrie Pitman, with all the North Atlantic to  play in, lurched down directly upon them. The \"We're Here\", under jib  and riding-sail, gave her no more room than was absolutely  necessary,--Disko did not wish to spend a week hunting for his  cable,--but scuttled up into the wind as the Carrie passed within easy  hail, a silent and angry boat, at the mercy of a raking broadside of  Bank chaff.    \"Good evenin',\" said Disko, raising his headgear, \"an' haow does your  garden grow?\"    \"Go to Ohio an' hire a mule,\" said Uncle Salters. \"We don't want no  farmers here.\"    \"Will I lend you my dory-anchor?\" cried Long Jack.    \"Unship your rudder an' stick it in the mud,\" said Tom Platt.    \"Say!\" Dan's voice rose shrill and high, as he stood on the wheel-box.  \"Sa-ay! Is there a strike in the o-ver-all factory; or hev they hired  girls, ye Shackamaxons?\"    \"Veer out the tiller-lines,\" cried Harvey, \"and nail 'em to the  bottom.\" That was a salt-flavoured jest he had been put up to by Tom  Platt. Manuel leaned over the stern and yelled; \"Johnna Morgan play the  organ! Ahaaaa!\" He flourished his broad thumb with a gesture of  unspeakable contempt and derision, while little Penn covered himself  with glory by piping up: \"Gee a little! Hssh! Come here. Haw!\"    They rode on their chain for the rest of the night, a short, snappy,  uneasy motion, as Harvey found, and wasted half the forenoon recovering  the cable. But the boys agreed the trouble was cheap at the price of  triumph and glory, and they thought with grief over all the beautiful  things that they might have said to the discomfited Carrie.        CHAPTER VII    Next day they fell in with more sails, all circling slowly from the  east northerly towards the west. But just when they expected to make  the shoals by the Virgin the fog shut down, and they anchored,  surrounded by the tinklings of invisible bells. There was not much  fishing, but occasionally dory met dory in the fog and exchanged news.    That night, a little before dawn, Dan and Harvey, who had been sleeping  most of the day, tumbled out to \"hook\" fried pies. There was no reason  why they should not have taken them openly; but they tasted better so,  and it made the cook angry. The heat and smell below drove them on deck  with their plunder, and they found Disko at the bell, which he handed  over to Harvey.    \"Keep her goin',\" said he. \"I mistrust I hear somethin'. Ef it's  anything, I'm best where I am so's to get at things.\"    It was a forlorn little jingle; the thick air seemed to pinch it off;  and in the pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner's siren,  and he knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to  him, with horrible distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured  jersey--he despised fancy blazers now with all a fisherman's  contempt--how an ignorant, rowdy boy had once said it would be \"great\"  if a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That boy had a state-room with a  hot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a  gilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy--no, his very much older  brother--was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming, crackling  oilskins, hammering, literally for the dear life, on a bell smaller  than the steward's breakfast-bell, while somewhere close at hand a  thirty-foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The  bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry,  upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat  before breakfast. So Harvey rang the bell.    \"Yes, they slow daown one turn o' their blame propeller,\" said Dan,  applying himself to Manuel's conch, \"fer to keep inside the law, an'  that's consolin' when we're all at the bottom. Hark to her' She's a  humper!\"    \"Aoooo--whoooo--whupp!\" went the siren. \"Wingle--tingle--tink,\" went  the bell. \"Graaa--ouch!\" went the conch, while sea and sky were all  milled up in milky fog. Then Harvey felt that he was near a moving  body, and found himself looking up and up at the wet edge of a  cliff-like bow, leaping, it seemed, directly over the schooner. A  jaunty little feather of water curled in front of it, and as it lifted  it showed a long ladder of Roman numerals--XV., XVI., XVII., XVIII.,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#17)"],[1,"for me to believe that by nature these people are invariably cruel,  rapacious, murderous. That in cases of Balkan massacres and outrages the  Bulgarian people have not been always the victims, and have not been  always blameless, I know. It is impossible to shut one's eyes to the  fact that something survives of the traditions of cruelty and reprisal  existing in the Balkans of the Middle Ages. In this Balkan peninsula  there is always a smell of blood in the nostrils, a mist of blood in the  eyes. The Bulgarians have taken their part in many incidents which seem  to deny the existence of Christian civilisation.    [Illustration: THE RATCHENITZA, THE NATIONAL DANCE OF BULGARIA]    But I speak of the people as I found them, and I came away from the  Balkans confident that my life and property would always be safe with  Bulgarian peasants, provided that I made no movement to begin trouble. I  came away, too, with a high idea of their essential soundness as a  nation and their certainty of a great future. Allowances have to be made  for the hostility of circumstances. As is insisted by the Bulgarians,  when the little nation started to restore its old home life, everything  had to be replaced. \"It was not only the political conditions which had  altered, but social life itself. At a moment's notice, and practically  out of nothing, a new administration had to be organised and the diverse  organs of the national life to be improvised. Hardly anything valuable  of the preceding regime could be utilised. In this connection, it is  interesting to observe the different fortunes of a conquered province.  When a province which had formed part of a civilised country passes to a  nation equally civilised, one may say that in many respects the change  is an unimportant one, because in such a case the conqueror retains  almost all the institutions, the only difference being that in the  future they work in the name of the new sovereign authority. The  political condition of such a province is the only thing which is  affected, the administrative and judicial system and the wealth  continuing as before. On the other hand, if one attempted to form a  modern state out of a country which has been devastated for centuries,  or if one tried to transform a Turkish province into a country after the  pattern of the European States, every step would be strewn with  obstacles, and there would be nothing of the former state of things that  could be utilised. In such a case, the only thing to be done would be to  borrow from other nations the experience which they have accumulated  during their long efforts, and to transplant it into the desolated land.  This is practically what happened in Bulgaria, and it is only by taking  into account the exceptionally difficult conditions in which the  Principality found itself on the morrow of its liberation that one will  be able to appreciate the efforts displayed and the result obtained.\"    In one particular there is to a British observer a marked failing in the  Bulgarian character: the Bulgars are very nervous to \"keep up  appearances\" and that makes them appear snobbish and deceitful at times.  They are ashamed of poverty, a little ashamed, too, of their natural  manners. Always they wish to put the best face on things before the  world. If a Bulgarian understood that you recognised any crudeness  anywhere he liked to pretend that it was not a usual thing but a  temporary circumstance due to the war. I got quite tired of hearing \"_La  guerre comme la guerre_\" murmured to me by apologetic Bulgarians  wanting to pretend that under normal circumstances his countrymen always  had the best of table silver and napery.    One incident (which left nothing but amiable memories) of a day's march  north of Adrianople I can recall illustrating this desire to keep up  appearances. After an anxious day I had got to a Bulgarian camp, was  welcomed by an officer and brought around to a little hut where the mess  was established. My new-made friend knocked at the door and explained  things in Bulgarian. I heard a scuffle and could not help seeing through  the window two young officers who were comfortably enjoying supper with  their coats off rushing to get into full uniform. Until they were  dressed properly there was no admittance to the stranger. That showed on  the whole a good feeling of pride: but sometimes Bulgarian sensitiveness  to criticism and desire to appear grand was a little trying. I suppose,  however, it is natural in a \"new\" people.    In most things, however, the Bulgarian is intensely practical. That  sturdy panegyrist of the Bulgars, Mr. Noel Buxton, M.P., insists upon  this practicality even when its effects were notably absent:        \"The Bulgarian mind,\" he writes, \"is practical. It is no doubt      still debated, among European military experts, whether the army      succeeded through a well-organised transport or in spite of the      want of it. The foreign Red Cross contingents at the front were      inclined to the latter view. Judged by English or by German      standards, the system, or want of system, employed led them to      suppose that success came from 'muddling through.' They found      that nothing was prepared for their arrival, and no      classification of the wounded carried out. But it may be doubted      whether the Bulgarian mind does not include some elements of a      quality which is really higher than statistical efficiency.\"    It calls for a more affectionate eye towards the Bulgar people than I  possess to be blind to the fact that in their medical and sanitary  arrangements for the campaign against the Turks they were woefully  deficient. The excuse of ignorance is the only one that will serve. The  only alternative to that would be a complete recklessness for life. In  the Bulgarian camps sanitary precautions were absolutely lacking, and on  the battlefields the provision for dealing with the wounded was  shockingly inadequate. When I came back from Chatalja to Kirk Kilisse,  King Ferdinand sent his private secretary for me as an independent  witness of the state of things at the front. I took the occasion to  acquaint His Majesty frankly with the ghastly consequences that had  followed from the absence of all precautions to ensure a wholesome water  supply, from the neglect of latrine regulations in the camps and other  failures in the medical and sanitary service. I had no reason to feel  that my frankness was resented, and I believe that (too late in the day)  an effort at reform was made. Certainly since then there has been  reform, and if Bulgaria should unhappily have to enter upon another  campaign probably the medical and sanitary services will be brought to a  high pitch of organisation.    Yes, the Bulgarian is very practical in mind but he has suffered, and  has yet to suffer again perhaps, from lack of experience to instruct his  practical mind. If the national pride would allow of it, an excellent  thing for Bulgaria would be to import half a dozen skilled officials  from, say, England and France to nurse her departments through the stage  of infancy. The nation has plenty of natural genius but makes mistakes  through inexperience.          CHAPTER IX    THE TRAGEDY OF 1914      When the war between the Balkan States and the Turkish Empire was  brought to a close for the time being by an armistice signed on the  battlefield of Chatalja, to which Bulgaria, Servia, and Turkey were  parties, and by the summoning of the Conference of London, to which  Greece also was a party, the prospects for Bulgaria's future were  singularly bright. As a power in the Balkans Turkey had ceased to exist.  She had been driven out of all Albania, Macedonia, Epirus, and Thrace,  except that beleaguered garrisons held the fortresses of Scutari,  Janina, and Adrianople and the Dardanelles forts, whilst behind the  lines of Chatalja a small area of Turkish territory remained under the  Crescent. The area held by the Bulgarian armies was greater at this time  than the territory assigned to her by the Treaty of San Stefano, and  promised to be extended as the result of the peace negotiations. In the  war which had just been waged the exploits of Bulgarian arms had  attracted the widest attention in Europe. Public opinion in most of the  capitals of the world assigned the future hegemony of the Balkan  Peninsula to the Bulgarian nation. But all this fair-seeming prospect  was the prelude to one of the greatest national tragedies in history.    I cannot better preface a relation of the facts of that tragedy than by  giving a summary of the position early in 1914, as it was given  anonymously by a noted Bulgarian diplomat to the _National Review_. He  wrote:        It is too late for pretending that all is well with the Balkan      League. Even in official quarters, where pessimism is generally      discouraged, it is no longer denied that relations between the      Allies have reached a critical stage.... It would form a sad      epilogue to a noble story if what began as a crusade of      liberation were to end in fratricidal strife.... Nominally, the      quarrel turns on the interpretation of treaties and their      bearing on the situation created by the war. But underneath all      these arguments there lurk preoccupations far transcending the      scope of written or oral agreements. The question at stake is      nothing less than the future balance of power in the Balkans.      The map of the Balkans has been transformed beyond recognition,      and Turkey has practically ceased to exist as a European power;      but those who expected it to inaugurate an era of tranquillity      have been disappointed. The failure of the war as an instrument      of pacification is largely due to the very magnitude of its      military success. Had the victories of the Allies been less      decisive, conditions might have arisen more favourable to the      cause of"]]]
