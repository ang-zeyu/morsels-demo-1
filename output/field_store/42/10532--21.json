In the meantime the younger brother Fritz was tending a soldier with a  terrible wound in the head. The seven men were now advancing steadily  from one ridge to the other, but Dietlof had reached a point on which  the burghers from behind were bombarding with their cannon, and as the  rocks flew into the air he found it impossible to proceed.    He therefore returned, and the captain sent a dispatch-bearer down  with orders that the cannon-firing should cease.    For a moment Dietlof went back to the wounded lieutenant, where he  found some of his comrades assembled, and while they stood there the  unfortunate man, exhausted by loss of blood, drew his last breath.    Through incredible dangers the seven burghers forced their way through  the donga until they reached the point from where they could attack  the enemy from behind. It was a most critical moment, for they were  exposed to the constant fire of their own burghers, under Commandant  Coetzee, as well as that of the enemy, but soon they were relieved to  see the white flag hoisted, and were then joined by the rest of the  commando.    The English could not believe that the party which had attacked them  from behind had consisted of only seven men.    Colonel Roberts, Lieutenant Lyall, and Lieutenant Davis were taken  with 210 men of the Lincolnshire Regiment. One officer escaped while  the burghers were disarming their prisoners and yielding themselves to  the spirit of plunder with which every man is possessed after a severe  struggle for victory.    Of dead and wounded the burghers had lost thirteen or fourteen men,  but the seven forerunners, who had been exposed to the greatest  dangers, escaped without a scratch, while the enemy, in spite of the  fact that they had been under cover throughout, lay dead and dying in  large numbers.    Strange to relate, a letter from an English officer fell into  Dietlof's hands some weeks later, and in glancing over it his eye fell  on the words, \"Lieutenant Pilkington is also dead--you know that  famous cricketer.\"    And still later Hansie heard from her brother that one of the seven  men, Field-cornet von Zulch, who afterwards joined him as prisoner of  war in the Ahmednagar Fort, told him that he had received a letter  from Lieutenant Pilkington's mother, begging for more particulars of  her son's last moments.    Many wonderful experiences were related, many glimpses given into the  conditions of commando life. The young man dwelt lightly for a moment  on his hardships and privations, saying, \"Mother, do you know those  woollen Kaffir blankets with yellow stars and leopards, and red and  green half-crescents?\"    \"Yes,\" his mother answered expectantly.    \"Well, I once had a pair of trousers made of that material.\"    Everyone laughed.    \"But there are worse things than _that_,\" he continued; \"unmentionable  horrors--things you pick up in the English camps and can't get rid of  again----\"    Hansie understood.    \"You will find a tin of insect-powder in that wonderful Indian juggler  of a portmanteau,\" she said, \"and don't forget to use the blank  exercise-book.\"    The thirty minutes were over, and they were considerately left alone  for a few moments----          CHAPTER XII    THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS         For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with       great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I       hid My face from thee for a moment; but with       everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith       the Lord thy Redeemer.--Isa. liv. 7 and 8.      The hand which holds my pen to-day trembles.    From the beginning it was not my intention to touch upon the  Concentration Camps, but this story of the war would be incomplete  without at least a brief outline of that which played so important a  part during the war.    After the occupation of Pretoria, and when it was found that  hostilities, instead of coming to an end, were continued under what  the English called a system of \"guerilla\" warfare, and that the Boer  forces, instead of being compelled to surrender through starvation or  exhaustion, continued to thrive and increase in numbers, the military  authorities found it necessary to adopt entirely new tactics. But  subsequent events showed that no greater strategical error was ever  committed.    Let me explain briefly for the benefit of those of my readers who have  forgotten the details of the great South African war.    The Boer Republics had no organised force. In the event of war against  natives or against some foreign Power, the burghers were called up  from their farms, the husbands, fathers, sons of the nation, to fight  for home and fatherland. This left the women and children unprotected  on the farms, but not unprovided for, for it is an historical fact  that the Boer women in time of war carried on their farming operations  with greater vigour than during times of peace. Fruit trees were  tended, fields were ploughed, and harvests brought in with redoubled  energy, with the result that crops increased and live-stock  multiplied.    From the natives they had nothing to fear--in fact, their work was  carried on with the help of native servants only. It soon became  evident to the British military authorities that the Boer forces were  being supplied with necessaries in the way of food and clothing by the  women on the farms.    From the Boer point of view this was right and good, but it was  perfectly natural that the English should resent it, and, in isolated  cases, where it was known beyond doubt to have taken place, the houses  were destroyed, and the women and children removed to the towns as  prisoners of war.    As time went on and the women continued to provide their men with the  necessaries of life, the British authorities decided to lay the entire  country waste, with the intention of depriving the Boer commandos of  all means of subsistence and forcing them, through starvation, into a  speedy surrender.    A systematic devastation of the two Boer Republics then took place.  Only the towns were spared; for the rest, the farms and homesteads  and even small villages, throughout the length and breadth of the  country, were laid waste. Trees were cut down, crops destroyed, homes,  pillaged of valuables, burnt with everything they contained, and the  women and children removed to camps in the districts to which they  belonged.    Now, we are well aware that a savage foe would have left these  helpless victims of the unavoidable circumstances of war on the veld  to die, but the English are not only not savages and heathens, but  they are one of the most civilised and humane Christian nations.    Concentration Camps were formed in every part of the country, and the  women and children placed in tents on the open veld, near the railway  lines where possible, or in close proximity to the towns.    The work of devastation, carried out by some British officers with  loathing and distaste, and by others with fiendish exultation, was not  completed in a few weeks or months. It was carried on right through  from the time when the policy was decided on until peace was declared,  and in the end nothing was left but the blackened ruins of once  prosperous homes.           *       *       *       *       *    If ever there was a war of surprises, it was the Anglo-Boer war.           *       *       *       *       *    Instead of hostilities being brought to a speedy termination by the  demolition of the farms, the Boer forces gathered and increased in  strength and numbers by the addition to their ranks of men who had  left the commandos and were again living on their farms.    Wives and children gone, homes devastated, there was nothing left for  the men to live for.    Instead of being brought to submission by the drastic measures taken  to compel them to surrender, they were transformed into raging lions,  with but one object in view, the expulsion of their enemy from the  land of their birth.    Not alone in the towns did the secret service do its work. As the  camps grew in size and close supervision became more difficult, the  spies crept in and out, bearing with them the information wanted by  the Boer leaders, concerning the condition of the inmates.    In nine cases out of ten the earnest request of the women to their men  was to fight to the bitter end--not to surrender on their account, but  to let them die in captivity sooner than yield for the sake of them  and their children.    Perhaps I may be allowed to say here that when Hansie was in the Irene  Camp as volunteer nurse she knew nothing of the work of the spies.    Love and pity drew her to the scene of suffering.           *       *       *       *       *    The British did not count the cost when they began the system of  gathering in the Boer families, any more than they did when they began  their \"walk over\" to Pretoria.    Not only had they to support women and children for an indefinite  period after the devastation of the farms, but the entire maintenance  of the scattered Boer forces fell to their lot. During nearly two  years the Boers lived on the enemy, took their convoys, wrecked their  trains, helped themselves to horses, clothing, ammunition,  provisions--everything, in fact, that they required for the  continuation of the war. To tell the truth, there was hardly a Mauser  rifle to be found in the possession of the Boers at the end of the  war, they having destroyed the rifles with which they began the war,  for want of Mauser ammunition, and using only the Lee Metfords of the  enemy.    Sickness broke out in the camps--scarlet fever, measles,  whooping-cough, enteric, pneumonia, and a thousand ills brought by  exposure, overcrowding, underfeeding, and untold hardships.    Expectant mothers, tender babes, the aged and infirm, torn from their  homes and herded together under conditions impossible to describe,  exposed to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#17)"],[1," slave life; where pride and pomp roll luxuriously at ease; where the  toil of a thousand men supports a single family in easy idleness and  sin. This is the great house; it is the home of the LLOYDS! Some idea of  its splendor has already been given--and, it is here that we shall find  that height of luxury which is the opposite of that depth of poverty  and physical wretchedness that we have just now been contemplating. But,  there is this difference in the two extremes;{82} viz: that in the  case of the slave, the miseries and hardships of his lot are imposed  by others, and, in the master's case, they are imposed by himself. The  slave is a subject, subjected by others; the slaveholder is a subject,  but he is the author of his own subjection. There is more truth in the  saying, that slavery is a greater evil to the master than to the slave,  than many, who utter it, suppose. The self-executing laws of eternal  justice follow close on the heels of the evil-doer here, as well as  elsewhere; making escape from all its penalties impossible. But, let  others philosophize; it is my province here to relate and describe; only  allowing myself a word or two, occasionally, to assist the reader in the  proper understanding of the facts narrated.          CHAPTER VII. _Life in the Great House_    COMFORTS AND LUXURIES--ELABORATE EXPENDITURE--HOUSE SERVANTS--MEN  SERVANTS AND MAID SERVANTS--APPEARANCES--SLAVE ARISTOCRACY--STABLE AND  CARRIAGE HOUSE--BOUNDLESS HOSPITALITY--FRAGRANCE OF RICH DISHES--THE  DECEPTIVE CHARACTER OF SLAVERY--SLAVES SEEM HAPPY--SLAVES  AND SLAVEHOLDERS ALIKE WRETCHED--FRETFUL DISCONTENT  OF SLAVEHOLDERS--FAULT-FINDING--OLD BARNEY--HIS  PROFESSION--WHIPPING--HUMILIATING SPECTACLE--CASE EXCEPTIONAL--WILLIAM  WILKS--SUPPOSED SON OF COL. LLOYD--CURIOUS INCIDENT--SLAVES PREFER RICH  MASTERS TO POOR ONES.      The close-fisted stinginess that fed the poor slave on coarse corn-meal  and tainted meat; that clothed him in crashy tow-linen, and hurried him  to toil through the field, in all weathers, with wind and rain beating  through his tattered garments; that scarcely gave even the young  slave-mother time to nurse her hungry infant in the fence corner; wholly  vanishes on approaching the sacred precincts of the great house,  the home of the Lloyds. There the scriptural phrase finds an exact  illustration; the highly favored inmates of this mansion are literally  arrayed \"in purple and fine linen,\" and fare sumptuously every day! The  table groans under the heavy and blood-bought luxuries gathered with  painstaking care, at home and abroad. Fields, forests, rivers and seas,  are made tributary here. Immense wealth, and its lavish expenditure,  fill the great house with all that can please the eye, or tempt the  taste. Here, appetite, not food, is the great _desideratum_. Fish, flesh  and fowl, are here in profusion. Chickens, of{84} all breeds; ducks,  of all kinds, wild and tame, the common, and the huge Muscovite; Guinea  fowls, turkeys, geese, and pea fowls, are in their several pens, fat and  fatting for the destined vortex. The graceful swan, the mongrels, the  black-necked wild goose; partridges, quails, pheasants and pigeons;  choice water fowl, with all their strange varieties, are caught in this  huge family net. Beef, veal, mutton and venison, of the most select  kinds and quality, roll bounteously to this grand consumer. The teeming  riches of the Chesapeake bay, its rock, perch, drums, crocus, trout,  oysters, crabs, and terrapin, are drawn hither to adorn the glittering  table of the great house. The dairy, too, probably the finest on the  Eastern Shore of Maryland--supplied by cattle of the best English stock,  imported for the purpose, pours its rich donations of fragant cheese,  golden butter, and delicious cream, to heighten the attraction of the  gorgeous, unending round of feasting. Nor are the fruits of the  earth forgotten or neglected. The fertile garden, many acres in  size, constituting a separate establishment, distinct from the common  farm--with its scientific gardener, imported from Scotland (a Mr.  McDermott) with four men under his direction, was not behind, either in  the abundance or in the delicacy of its contributions to the same full  board. The tender asparagus, the succulent celery, and the delicate  cauliflower; egg plants, beets, lettuce, parsnips, peas, and French  beans, early and late; radishes, cantelopes, melons of all kinds; the  fruits and flowers of all climes and of all descriptions, from the hardy  apple of the north, to the lemon and orange of the south, culminated at  this point. Baltimore gathered figs, raisins, almonds and juicy grapes  from Spain. Wines and brandies from France; teas of various flavor, from  China; and rich, aromatic coffee from Java, all conspired to swell  the tide of high life, where pride and indolence rolled and lounged in  magnificence and satiety.    Behind the tall-backed and elaborately wrought chairs, stand the  servants, men and maidens--fifteen in number--discriminately selected,  not only with a view to their industry and faithfulness,{85} but with  special regard to their personal appearance, their graceful agility and  captivating address. Some of these are armed with fans, and are fanning  reviving breezes toward the over-heated brows of the alabaster ladies;  others watch with eager eye, and with fawn-like step anticipate and  supply wants before they are sufficiently formed to be announced by word  or sign.    These servants constituted a sort of black aristocracy on Col. Lloyd's  plantation. They resembled the field hands in nothing, except in color,  and in this they held the advantage of a velvet-like glossiness, rich  and beautiful. The hair, too, showed the same advantage. The delicate  colored maid rustled in the scarcely worn silk of her young mistress,  while the servant men were equally well attired from the over-flowing  wardrobe of their young masters; so that, in dress, as well as in form  and feature, in manner and speech, in tastes and habits, the distance  between these favored few, and the sorrow and hunger-smitten multitudes  of the quarter and the field, was immense; and this is seldom passed  over.    Let us now glance at the stables and the carriage house, and we shall  find the same evidences of pride and luxurious extravagance. Here are  three splendid coaches, soft within and lustrous without. Here, too,  are gigs, phaetons, barouches, sulkeys and sleighs. Here are saddles and  harnesses--beautifully wrought and silver mounted--kept with every care.  In the stable you will find, kept only for pleasure, full thirty-five  horses, of the most approved blood for speed and beauty. There are two  men here constantly employed in taking care of these horses. One of  these men must be always in the stable, to answer every call from the  great house. Over the way from the stable, is a house built expressly  for the hounds--a pack of twenty-five or thirty--whose fare would have  made glad the heart of a dozen slaves. Horses and hounds are not the  only consumers of the slave's toil. There was practiced, at the  Lloyd's, a hospitality which would have{86} astonished and charmed any  health-seeking northern divine or merchant, who might have chanced  to share it. Viewed from his own table, and _not_ from the field, the  colonel was a model of generous hospitality. His house was, literally,  a hotel, for weeks during the summer months. At these times, especially,  the air was freighted with the rich fumes of baking, boiling, roasting  and broiling. The odors I shared with the winds; but the meats were  under a more stringent monopoly except that, occasionally, I got a cake  from Mas' Daniel. In Mas' Daniel I had a friend at court, from whom  I learned many things which my eager curiosity was excited to know. I  always knew when company was expected, and who they were, although I was  an outsider, being the property, not of Col. Lloyd, but of a servant of  the wealthy colonel. On these occasions, all that pride, taste and money  could do, to dazzle and charm, was done.    Who could say that the servants of Col. Lloyd were not well clad and  cared for, after witnessing one of his magnificent entertainments? Who  could say that they did not seem to glory in being the slaves of such a  master? Who, but a fanatic, could get up any sympathy for persons  whose every movement was agile, easy and graceful, and who evinced a  consciousness of high superiority? And who would ever venture to suspect  that Col. Lloyd was subject to the troubles of ordinary mortals? Master  and slave seem alike in their glory here? Can it all be seeming?  Alas! it may only be a sham at last! This immense wealth; this gilded  splendor; this profusion of luxury; this exemption from toil; this life  of ease; this sea of plenty; aye, what of it all? Are the pearly gates  of happiness and sweet content flung open to such suitors? _far from  it!_ The poor slave, on his hard, pine plank, but scantily covered with  his thin blanket, sleeps more soundly than the feverish voluptuary who  reclines upon his feather bed and downy pillow. Food, to the indolent  lounger, is poison, not sustenance. Lurking beneath all their  dishes, are invisible spirits of evil, ready to feed the self-deluded  gormandizers{87} which aches, pains, fierce temper, uncontrolled  passions, dyspepsia, rheumatism, lumbago and gout; and of these the  Lloyds got their full share. To the pampered love of ease, there is no  resting place. What is pleasant today, is repulsive tomorrow; what is  soft now, is hard at another time; what is sweet in the morning, is  bitter in the evening. Neither to the wicked, nor to the idler, is there  any solid peace: _\"Troubled, like the restless sea.\"_    I had excellent opportunities of witnessing the restless discontent and  the capricious irritation of the Lloyds. My fondness for horses--not  peculiar to me more than to other boys"]]]
