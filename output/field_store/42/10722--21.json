The words were  repeated with blanched cheeks and quivering lips. I waked Mr. and Mrs.  Lewis, and told them that the President was shot, and that I must go to  the White House. I could not remain in a state of uncertainty. I felt  that the house would not hold me. They tried to quiet me, but gentle  words could not calm the wild tempest. They quickly dressed themselves,  and we sallied out into the street to drift with the excited throng. We  walked rapidly towards the White House, and on our way passed the  residence of Secretary Seward, which was surrounded by armed soldiers,  keeping back all intruders with the point of the bayonet. We hurried on,  and as we approached the White House, saw that it too was surrounded  with soldiers. Every entrance was strongly guarded, and no one was  permitted to pass. The guard at the gate told us that Mr. Lincoln had  not been brought home, but refused to give any other information. More  excited than ever, we wandered down the street. Grief and anxiety were  making me weak, and as we joined the outskirts of a large crowd, I began  to feel as meek and humble as a penitent child. A gray-haired old man  was passing. I caught a glimpse of his face, and it seemed so full of  kindness and sorrow that I gently touched his arm, and imploringly  asked:    \"Will you please, sir, to tell me whether Mr. Lincoln is dead or not?\"    \"Not dead,\" he replied, \"but dying. God help us!\" and with a heavy step  he passed on.    \"Not dead, but dying! then indeed God help us!\"    We learned that the President was mortally wounded--that he had been  shot down in his box at the theatre, and that he was not expected to  live till morning; when we returned home with heavy hearts. I could not  sleep. I wanted to go to Mrs. Lincoln, as I pictured her wild with  grief; but then I did not know where to find her, and I must wait till  morning. Never did the hours drag so slowly. Every moment seemed an age,  and I could do nothing but walk about and hold my arms in mental agony.    Morning came at last, and a sad morning was it. The flags that floated  so gayly yesterday now were draped in black, and hung in silent folds at  half-mast. The President was dead, and a nation was mourning for him.  Every house was draped in black, and every face wore a solemn look.  People spoke in subdued tones, and glided whisperingly, wonderingly,  silently about the streets.    About eleven o'clock on Saturday morning a carriage drove up to the  door, and a messenger asked for \"Elizabeth Keckley.\"    \"Who wants her?\" I asked.    \"I come from Mrs. Lincoln. If you are Mrs. Keckley, come with me  immediately to the White House.\"    I hastily put on my shawl and bonnet, and was driven at a rapid rate to  the White House. Everything about the building was sad and solemn. I was  quickly shown to Mrs. Lincoln's room, and on entering, saw Mrs. L.  tossing uneasily about upon a bed. The room was darkened, and the only  person in it besides the widow of the President was Mrs. Secretary  Welles, who had spent the night with her. Bowing to Mrs. Welles, I went  to the bedside.    \"Why did you not come to me last night, Elizabeth--I sent for you?\" Mrs.  Lincoln asked in a low whisper.    \"I did try to come to you, but I could not find you,\" I answered, as I  laid my hand upon her hot brow.    I afterwards learned, that when she had partially recovered from the  first shock of the terrible tragedy in the theatre, Mrs. Welles asked:    \"Is there no one, Mrs. Lincoln, that you desire to have with you in this  terrible affliction?\"    \"Yes, send for Elizabeth Keckley. I want her just as soon as she can be  brought here.\"    Three messengers, it appears, were successively despatched for me, but  all of them mistook the number and failed to find me.    Shortly after entering the room on Saturday morning, Mrs. Welles excused  herself, as she said she must go to her own family, and I was left alone  with Mrs. Lincoln.    She was nearly exhausted with grief, and when she became a little quiet,  I asked and received permission to go into the Guests' Room, where the  body of the President lay in state. When I crossed the threshold of the  room, I could not help recalling the day on which I had seen little  Willie lying in his coffin where the body of his father now lay. I  remembered how the President had wept over the pale beautiful face of  his gifted boy, and now the President himself was dead. The last time I  saw him he spoke kindly to me, but alas! the lips would never move  again. The light had faded from his eyes, and when the light went out  the soul went with it. What a noble soul was his--noble in all the noble  attributes of God! Never did I enter the solemn chamber of death with  such palpitating heart and trembling footsteps as I entered it that day.  No common mortal had died. The Moses of my people had fallen in the hour  of his triumph. Fame had woven her choicest chaplet for his brow. Though  the brow was cold and pale in death, the chaplet should not fade, for  God had studded it with the glory of the eternal stars.    When I entered the room, the members of the Cabinet and many  distinguished officers of the army were grouped around the body of their  fallen chief. They made room for me, and, approaching the body, I lifted  the white cloth from the white face of the man that I had worshipped as  an idol--looked upon as a demi-god. Notwithstanding the violence of the  death of the President, there was something beautiful as well as grandly  solemn in the expression of the placid face. There lurked the sweetness  and gentleness of childhood, and the stately grandeur of godlike  intellect. I gazed long at the face, and turned away with tears in my  eyes and a choking sensation in my throat. Ah! never was man so widely  mourned before. The whole world bowed their heads in grief when Abraham  Lincoln died.    Returning to Mrs. Lincoln's room, I found her in a new paroxysm of  grief. Robert was bending over his mother with tender affection, and  little Tad was crouched at the foot of the bed with a world of agony in  his young face. I shall never forget the scene--the wails of a broken  heart, the unearthly shrieks, the terrible convulsions, the wild,  tempestuous outbursts of grief from the soul. I bathed Mrs. Lincoln's  head with cold water, and soothed the terrible tornado as best I could.  Tad's grief at his father's death was as great as the grief of his  mother, but her terrible outbursts awed the boy into silence. Sometimes  he would throw his arms around her neck, and exclaim, between his broken  sobs, \"Don't cry so, Mamma! don't cry, or you will make me cry, too! You  will break my heart.\"    Mrs. Lincoln could not bear to hear Tad cry, and when he would plead to  her not to break his heart, she would calm herself with a great effort,  and clasp her child in her arms.    Every room in the White House was darkened, and every one spoke in  subdued tones, and moved about with muffled tread. The very atmosphere  breathed of the great sorrow which weighed heavily upon each heart. Mrs.  Lincoln never left her room, and while the body of her husband was being  borne in solemn state from the Atlantic to the broad prairies of the  West, she was weeping with her fatherless children in her private  chamber. She denied admittance to almost every one, and I was her only  companion, except her children, in the days of her great sorrow.    There were many surmises as to who was implicated with J. Wilkes Booth  in the assassination of the President. A new messenger had accompanied  Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln to the theatre on that terrible Friday night. It  was the duty of this messenger to stand at the door of the box during  the performance, and thus guard the inmates from all intrusion. It  appears that the messenger was carried away by the play, and so  neglected his duty that Booth gained easy admission to the box. Mrs.  Lincoln firmly believed that this messenger was implicated in the  assassination plot.    One night I was lying on a lounge near the bed occupied by Mrs. Lincoln.  One of the servants entering the room, Mrs. L. asked:    \"Who is on watch to-night?\"    \"The new messenger,\" was the reply.    \"What! the man who attended us to the theatre on the night my dear, good  husband was murdered! He, I believe, is one of the murderers. Tell him  to come in to me.\"    The messenger had overheard Mrs. Lincoln's words through the half-open  door, and when he came in he was trembling violently.    She turned to him fiercely: \"So you are on guard to-night--on guard in  the White House after helping to murder the President!\"    \"Pardon me, but I did not help to murder the President. I could never  stoop to murder--much less to the murder of so good and great a man as  the President.\"    \"But it appears that you _did_ stoop to murder.\"    \"No, no! don't say that,\" he broke in. \"God knows that I am innocent.\"    \"I don't believe you. Why were you not at the door to keep the assassin  out when he rushed into the box?\"    \"I did wrong, I admit, and I have bitterly repented it, but I did not  help to kill the President. I did not believe that any one would try to  kill so good a man in such a public place, and the belief made me  careless. I was attracted by the play, and did not see the assassin  enter the box.\"    \"But you should have seen him. You had no business to be careless. I  shall always believe that you are guilty. Hush! I shan't hear another  word,\" she exclaimed, as the messenger essayed to reply. \"Go now and  keep your watch,\" she added, with an imperious wave of her hand. With  mechanical step and white face the messenger left the room, and Mrs.  Lincoln fell back on her pillow, covered her face with her hands, and  commenced sobbing.    Robert was very tender to his mother in the days of her sorrow.
