And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for  the Sea Catch. All the same, I wish they'd hurry.\"    It was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went more than forty or  fifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the  shore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and  under them, but he could not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went  farther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick  nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were  following up a warm current of water, and then he respected them more.    One night they sank through the shiny water--sank like stones--and for  the first time since he had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick  followed, and the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow  was anything of a swimmer. They headed for a cliff by the shore--a cliff  that ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the  foot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a long, long swim, and  Kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they  led him through.    \"My wig!\" he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at  the farther end. \"It was a long dive, but it was worth it.\"    The sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of  the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long  stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make  seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland  behind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long  grass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all,  Kotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea  catch, that no men had ever come there.    The first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good,  and then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low  sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the  northward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that  would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between  the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to  the perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth  of the tunnel.    \"It's Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,\" said Kotick. \"Sea  Cow must be wiser than I thought. Men can't come down the cliffs, even  if there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to  splinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.\"    He began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was  in a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new  country, so that he would be able to answer all questions.    Then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced  through to the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have  dreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the  cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them.    He was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when  he hauled out just above Sea Lion's Neck the first person he met was the  seal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes  that he had found his island at last.    But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals  laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young  seal about his own age said, \"This is all very well, Kotick, but you  can't come from no one knows where and order us off like this. Remember  we've been fighting for our nurseries, and that's a thing you never did.  You preferred prowling about in the sea.\"    The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his  head from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a  great fuss about it.    \"I've no nursery to fight for,\" said Kotick. \"I only want to show you  all a place where you will be safe. What's the use of fighting?\"    \"Oh, if you're trying to back out, of course I've no more to say,\" said  the young seal with an ugly chuckle.    \"Will you come with me if I win?\" said Kotick. And a green light came  into his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all.    \"Very good,\" said the young seal carelessly. \"If you win, I'll come.\"    He had no time to change his mind, for Kotick's head was out and his  teeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal's neck. Then he threw  himself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook  him, and knocked him over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: \"I've done  my best for you these five seasons past. I've found you the island where  you'll be safe, but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks  you won't believe. I'm going to teach you now. Look out for yourselves!\"    Limmershin told me that never in his life--and Limmershin sees ten  thousand big seals fighting every year--never in all his little life  did he see anything like Kotick's charge into the nurseries. He flung  himself at the biggest sea catch he could find, caught him by the  throat, choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for  mercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the next. You see, Kotick  had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year, and  his deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best  of all, he had never fought before. His curly white mane stood up with  rage, and his eyes flamed, and his big dog teeth glistened, and he was  splendid to look at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past,  hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut,  and upsetting the young bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave  a roar and shouted: \"He may be a fool, but he is the best fighter on the  beaches! Don't tackle your father, my son! He's with you!\"    Kotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his mustache  on end, blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was  going to marry Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was  a gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there was a seal that  dared lift up his head, and when there were none they paraded grandly up  and down the beach side by side, bellowing.    At night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through  the fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered  nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. \"Now,\" he said, \"I've taught  you your lesson.\"    \"My wig!\" said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was  fearfully mauled. \"The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up  worse. Son, I'm proud of you, and what's more, I'll come with you to  your island--if there is such a place.\"    \"Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow's  tunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again,\" roared Kotick.    There was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the  beaches. \"We will come,\" said thousands of tired voices. \"We will follow  Kotick, the White Seal.\"    Then Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes  proudly. He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail.  All the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his  wounds.    A week later he and his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old  seals) went away north to the Sea Cow's tunnel, Kotick leading them,  and the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next  spring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick's  seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cow's tunnel that  more and more seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at  once, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to  turn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went  away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the  quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through,  getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the  holluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes.          Lukannon    This is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when  they are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of  very sad seal National Anthem.         I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!)       Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;       I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers' song--       The Beaches of Lukannon--two million voices strong.         The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,       The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,       The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame--       The Beaches of Lukannon--before the sealers came!         I met my mates in the morning (I'll never meet them more!);       They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.       And o'er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach       We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.         The Beaches of Lukannon--the winter wheat so tall--       The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!       The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!       The Beaches of Lukannon--the home where we were born!         I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.       Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;       Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,       And still we sing Lukannon--before the sealers came.         Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!       And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;       Ere,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#17)"],[1,"or year, but by a long series of appropriate  means. Then by what? Chiefly in and by love, which is specially adapted  thus to develop this maturity.    3. PHYSICAL STATURE.--Men and women generally increase in stature until the  twenty-fifth year, and it is safe to assume, that perfection of function is  not established until maturity of bodily development is completed. The  physical contour of these representations plainly exhibits the difference  in structure, and also implies difference of function. Solidity and  strength are represented by the organization of the male, grace and beauty  by that of the female. His broad shoulders represent physical power and the  right of dominion, while her bosom is the symbol of love and nutrition.    HOW TO DETERMINE A PERFECT HUMAN FIGURE.    [Illustration: Lady's Dress in the days of Greece.]    The proportions of the perfect human figure are strictly mathematical. The  whole figure is six times the length of the foot. Whether the form be  slender or plump, this rule holds good. Any deviation from it is a  departure from the highest beauty of proportion. The Greeks made all their  statues according to this rule. The face, from the highest point of the  forehead, where the hair begins, to the end of the chin, is one-tenth of  the whole stature. The hand, from the wrist to the end of the middle  finger, is the same. The chest is a fourth, and from the nipples to the top  of the head is the same. From the top of the chest to the highest point of  the forehead is a seventh. If the length of the face, from the roots of the  hair to the chin, be divided into three equal parts, the first division  determines the point where the eyebrows meet, and the second the place of  the nostrils. The navel is the central point of the human body, and if a  man should lie on his back with his arms and legs extended, the periphery  of the circle which might be described around him, with the navel for its  center, would touch the extremities of his hands and feet. The height from  the feet to the top of the head is the same as the {100} distance from the  extremity of one hand to the extremity of the other when the arms are  extended.    The Venus de Medici is considered the most perfect model of the female  forms, and has been the admiration of the world for ages. Alexander Walker,  after minutely describing this celebrated statue, says: \"All these  admirable characteristics of the female form, the mere existence of which  in woman must, one is temped to imagine, be, even to herself, a source of  ineffable pleasure, these constitute a being worthy, as the personification  of beauty, of occupying the temples of Greece; present an object finer,  alas, than Nature even seems capable of producing; and offer to all nations  and ages a theme of admiration and delight.\" Well might Thomson say:      So stands the statue that enchants the world,    So, bending, tries to vail the matchless boast--    The mingled beauties of exulting Greece.    We beg our readers to observe the form of the waist (evidently innocent of  corsets and tight dresses) of this model woman, and also that of the Greek  Slave in the accompanying outlines. These forms are such as unperverted  nature and the highest art alike require. To compress the waist, and  thereby change its form, pushing the ribs inward, displacing the vital  organs, and preventing the due expansion of the lungs, is as destructive to  beauty as it is to health. {101}    THE HISTORY, MYSTERY, BENEFITS AND INJURIES OF THE CORSET.    [Illustration: The Corset in the 18th Century.]    1. The origin of the corset is lost in remote antiquity. The figures of the  early Egyptian women show clearly an artificial shape of the waist produced  by some style of corset. A similar style of dress must also have prevailed  among the ancient Jewish maidens; for Isaiah, in calling upon the women to  put away their personal adornments, says: \"Instead of a girdle there shall  be a rent, and instead of a stomacher (corset) a girdle of sackcloth.\"    2. Homer also tells us of the cestus or girdle of Venus, which was borrowed  by the haughty Juno with a view to increasing her personal attractions,  that Jupiter might be a more tractable and orderly husband.    3. Coming down to the later times, we find the corset was used in France  and England as early as the 12th century.    4. The most extensive and extreme use of the corset occurred in the 16th  century, during the reign of Catherine de Medici of France and Queen  Elizabeth of England. With Catherine de Medici a thirteen-inch waist  measurement was considered the standard of fashion, while a thick waist was  an abomination. No lady could consider her figure of proper shape unless  she could span her waist with her two hands. To produce this result a  strong rigid corset was worn night and day until the waist was laced down  to the required size. Then over this corset was placed the steel apparatus  shown in the illustration on next page. This corset-cover reached from the  hip to the throat, and {102} produced a rigid figure over which the dress  would fit with perfect smoothness.    5. During the 18th century corsets were largely made from a species of  leather known as \"Bend,\" which was not unlike that used for shoe soles, and  measured nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. One of the most popular  corsets of the time was the corset and stomacher shown in the accompanying  illustration.    [Illustration: Steel Corset worn in Catherine's time.]    6. About the time of the French Revolution a reaction set in against tight  lacing, and for a time there was a return to the early classical Greek  costume. This style of dress prevailed, with various modifications, until  about 1810, when corsets and tight lacing again returned with threefold  fury. Buchan, a prominent writer of this period, says that it was by no  means uncommon to see \"a mother lay her daughter down upon the carpet, and,  placing her foot upon her back, break half a dozen laces in tightening her  stays.\"    7. It is reserved to our own time to demonstrate that corsets and tight  lacing do not necessarily go hand in hand. Distortion and feebleness are  not beauty. A proper proportion should exist between the size of the waist  and the breadth of the shoulders and hips, and if the waist is diminished  below this proportion, it suggests disproportion and invalidism rather than  grace and beauty.    8. The perfect corset is one which possesses just that degree of rigidity  which will prevent it from wrinkling, but will at the same time allow  freedom in the bending and twisting of the body. Corsets boned with  whalebone, horn or steel are necessarily stiff, rigid and uncomfortable.  After a few days' wear the bones or steels become bent and set in position,  or, as more frequently happens, they break and cause injury or discomfort  to the wearer.    9. About seven years ago an article was discovered for the stiffening of  corsets, which has revolutionized the corset industry of the world. This  article is manufactured from {103} the natural fibers of the Mexican Ixtle  plant, and is known as Coraline. It consists of straight, stiff fibers like  bristles bound together into a cord by being wound with two strands of  thread passing in opposite directions. This produces an elastic fiber  intermediate in stiffness between twine and whalebone. It cannot break, but  it possesses all the stiffness and flexibility necessary to hold the corset  in shape and prevent its wrinkling.    We congratulate the ladies of to-day upon the advantages they enjoy over  their sisters of two centuries ago, in the forms and the graceful and easy  curves of the corsets now made as compared with those of former times.    [Illustration: Forms of Corsets in the time of Elizabeth of England.]    {104}    TIGHT-LACING.    [Illustration: EGYPTIAN CORSET.]    [Illustration: THE NATURAL WAIST.  THE EFFECTS OF LACING.]    It destroys natural beauty and creates an unpleasant and irritable temper.  A tight-laced chest and a good disposition cannot go together. The human  form has been molded by nature, the best shape is undoubtedly that which  she has given it. To endeavor to render it more elegant by artificial means  is to change it; to make it much smaller below and much larger above is to  destroy its beauty; to keep it cased up in a kind of domestic cuirass is  not only to deform it, but to expose the internal parts to serious injury.  Under such compression as is commonly practiced by ladies, the {105}  development of the bones, which are still tender, does not take place  conformably to the intention of nature, because nutrition is necessarily  stopped, and they consequently become twisted and deformed.    Those who wear these appliances of tight-lacing often complain that they  cannot sit upright without them--are sometimes, indeed, compelled to wear  them during all the twenty-four hours; a fact which proves to what extent  such articles weaken the muscles of the trunk. The injury does not fall  merely on the internal structure of the body, but also on its beauty, and  on the temper and feelings with which that beauty is associated. Beauty is  in reality but another name for expression of countenance, which is the  index of sound health, intelligence, good feelings and peace of mind. All  are aware that uneasy feelings, existing habitually in the breast speedily  exhibit their signature on the countenance, and that bitter thoughts or a  bad temper spoil the human expression of its comeliness and grace.           *       *       *       *       *      {107}    The Care of the Hair.
