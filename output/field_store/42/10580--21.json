It chanced that among these last there was a negro who seemed gradually  to be sinking, despite the utmost efforts of Hutchinson to save him; and  this individual, named M'Pandala, had latterly evinced a disposition to  be friendly and communicative to Cupid, our Krooboy, who had been told  off for hospital duty in the house occupied by the enemy's wounded; and  at length--it was on the tenth day of our occupation of the island, and  I was by this time well enough to be out and about again, although still  unable to do much on account of my disabled arm--this negro made a  certain communication to Cupid which the latter deemed it his duty to  pass on to me without loss of time.  Accordingly, on the evening of that  day, after Cupid had been relieved--he was on day duty--he sought me out  and began--    \"Mr Fortescue, sar, you know dem M'Pandala, in dere?\" pointing with his  chin toward the house in which the wounded man was lodged.    \"No, Cupid,\" I answered.  \"I cannot truthfully say that I enjoy the  honour of the gentleman's acquaintance.  Who and what is he?\"    Cupid grinned.  \"Him one Eboe man,\" he answered, \"employed by dem  Portugee to cook for and look after dem captain's house.  He lib for  die, one time now; and 'cause I been good to him, and gib him plenty  drink when he thirsty, he tell me to-day one t'ing dat I t'ink de  captain be glad to know.  He say dat very soon--perhaps to-morrow or  next day, or de day after--one big cauffle of slabe most likely comin'  here for be ship away from de coas'; and now dat he am goin' to die he  feel sorry for dem slabe and feel glad if dem was set free.\"    \"Whew!\"  I whistled.  \"That is a bit of news well worth knowing--if it  can be relied upon.  Do you believe that the fellow is telling the  truth, Cupid?\"    \"Cartain, Mr Fortescue, sar,\" answered the Krooboy, with conviction.  \"He lib for die now; what he want to tell me lie for?  He no want debbil  to come after him and say, `Hi, you M'Pandala, why you tell dem white  men lie about slabe cauffle comin' down to de coas'?  You come along wid  me, sar!'  No, he not want dat, for cartain.\"    \"When did he tell you this, Cupid?\"  I demanded.    \"'Bout two hour ago,\" answered Cupid.  \"He say to me, `Cupid, I lib for  die to-night, and when you come on duty to-morrow you find me gone.  So  I want to tell you somet'ing now, before it too late.'  And den he tell  me de news, Mr Fortescue, sar, just as I tell it to you, only in de  Eboe language, which I understand, bein' well educate.\"    \"All right,\" said I.  \"In that case you had better come with me at once  to the captain, and we will tell him the yarn.  The sooner he hears it  the better.  Did he tell you where the cauffle was coming from, and  which way?\"    \"He say,\" answered Cupid, \"dat dem cauffle am comin' down from de Bakota  country, where 'most all de slabe sent from dis place come from; and  dere is only one way for dem to come here, t'rough de bush ober de oder  side ob de water.  Den dey bring dem across to de island in dem big  flat-bottom punt dat lay moored up by de top end ob de wharf.\"    We found the captain in the store with Mr Futtock, the boatswain,  overhauling the various articles salved from the wreck, and as soon as  he had seen all that he desired, and was ready to leave the building, I  got hold of him and repeated the yarn that Cupid had spun to me, the  Krooboy confirming and elaborating my statement from time to time as I  went on, and answering such questions as the skipper put to him.  When  at length we had brought the yarn to an end the captain stood for some  minutes wrapped in deep thought, and then said--    \"This is a very valuable piece of information that you have managed to  pick up, Cupid: and if it should prove to be well founded I will not  forget that we owe it to you.  It is too late now, Mr Fortescue, to do  anything in the matter to-night, for it will be dark in less than half  an hour; but the first thing to-morrow morning you and Cupid here had  better take the dinghy, pull across to the mainland, and endeavour to  find the road by which the cauffle will come--there ought not to be very  much difficulty in doing that, I should think.  And, having found it, it  will be well for the pair of you to proceed along the road on the look-  out for some suitable spot at which to ambush the party, after which the  rest should be easy.  There is, however, another matter that needs  consideration.  How are we to ascertain the precise moment at which to  expect the arrival of the slave-dealers?  Because it will be hardly  desirable to take a party out, day after day, and keep them in the bush  all day waiting for the cauffle to come along.  We are all doing  excellently well here; but two or three days spent in the bush would  very possibly mean half the party being down with fever.\"    Here Cupid, bursting with pride and importance at finding himself, as it  were, a member of a council over which the captain was presiding, struck  in--    \"You jus' leabe dat to me, sar.  Suppose you gib me leabe to go, I take  ration for, say, free day, and go off by myself into de bush to meet dem  cauffle.  Dhen when I hab met dem I soon find out when dem expec' to  arribe here, and I come back and tell you.\"    The skipper regarded the black doubtfully.    \"But,\" he objected, \"if you fall in with them, my man, the traders are  as likely as not to shoot you; or, if not that, at least to seize you  and chain you on to the cauffle.  Then how could you let us know when to  expect the beggars?\"    \"No fear ob dat, sar,\" answered Cupid with a grin.  \"I shall take care  dat dem do not know I, Cupid, am anywhere near dem.  Dem shall neber  suspec' my presence, sar; but I shall be dere, all de same, and shall  take partikler care to hear eberyt'ing dat dem say, so dat we may know  exactly when to expec' dem.  And when I hab learned dat piece of  information, I shall hurry back so as to let you know as early as  possible.  I don' t'ink dat dere is much fault to find wid dat plan,  sar.\"    \"No,\" answered the skipper, smiling at the black's eagerness and  excitement, \"provided, of course, that you are quite confident of your  ability to carry it through.\"    \"You trust me, sar; I'll carry it through all right, sar,\" answered  Cupid, in huge delight at being specially entrusted by the skipper with  this mission.  \"You hab but to gib me leabe to go, and I will undertake  to carry out de enterprise to your entire satisfaction.\"    \"Very well,\" said the skipper, now struggling manfully to suppress his  inclination to laugh outright at the man's high-flown phraseology; \"let  it be so, then.  Mr Fortescue, I leave it with you to arrange the  matter.\"  And he turned away.    On the following morning, Cupid having called me at daylight, I snatched  a hasty breakfast of cocoa and biscuit, and then wended my way to the  wharf, where the Krooboy, in light marching order, with three days'  rations--which he proposed to supplement on the way, if necessary--tied  up in a gaudy bandana handkerchief, awaited me in the dinghy.  Scrambling down into the boat with some circumspection--for my broken  arm, although knitting together again nicely, was still rather painful  at times, and very liable to break again in the same place if treated  roughly--I took my place in the stern-sheets, whereupon Cupid, giving  the little cockle-shell a powerful thrust off from the wharf wall, threw  out the two tiny oars by which the boat was usually propelled, and  proceeded with long powerful strokes to row across to the mainland, at  this point a bare half-mile distant.  As we went the black informed me  that, with the view of ascertaining a few additional items of  information of which he had thought during the night, he had looked into  the ward wherein his friend M'Pandala had been lodged, but had  discovered, as he indeed more than half feared, that the Eboe had  quietly slipped his moorings during the night and passed on into his own  particular \"happy hunting grounds.\"  But he added cheerfully that, after  all, it really did not greatly matter; he would probably be able to  obtain the required information in some other way.    Arrived at the other side of the inlet, it became necessary for us to  search the shore for the spot at which the bush road debouched, and this  we eventually found with some difficulty, for, like everything else  connected with the factory, it had been very carefully arranged with the  object of screening it from casual observation.  But once discovered,  our difficulties in that respect were at an end, for we found that it  ran down into a tiny indentation in the shore, just sufficiently  spacious to accommodate two of the large flats or punts at a time, with  firm ground, sloping gently down into the water, affording admirable  facilities for the rapid embarkation of large numbers of people.    Hauling the dinghy's stem up on this piece of firm sloping ground, and  making fast her painter to a convenient tree, as a further precaution,  Cupid and I set out along the firm, well-beaten path, some six feet in  width, which had been cleared through the dense and impenetrable bush  that hemmed us in on either hand, tormented all the while by the dense  clouds of mosquitoes and other stinging and biting insects that hovered  about us in clouds and positively declined to be driven away.    We walked thus about a mile and a half when we came out upon an open  space, some ten acres in extent, through which the path ran.  This  cleared space had evidently been caused by a bush fire at no very  distant date, for a few charred trunks and portions of trunks of trees  still reared themselves here and there; but the undergrowth had all been  burned away down to the bare earth,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#17)"],[1,"suggests itself with regard to the consciousness. In  what measure is it separable from the object? Do the consciousness and  its object form two things or only one?    Under observation these two terms constantly show themselves united.  We experience a sensation and have consciousness of it; it is the same  fact expressed in two different ways. All facts of our perception thus  present themselves, and they are one. But our reason may outstrip our  observation. We are able to make a distinction between the two  elements _being_ and _being perceived_. This is not an experimental  but an ideological distinction, and an abstraction that language makes  easy.    Can we go further, and suppose one of the parts thus analysed capable  of existing without the other? Can sensation exist as physical  expression, as an object; without being illuminated by the  consciousness? Can the consciousness exist without having an object?    Let us first speak of the existence of the object when considered as  separated from the consciousness. The problem is highly complicated.    It has sometimes been connected with the idealist thesis according to  which the object of consciousness, being itself a modality of the  consciousness, cannot exist apart from it--that is to say, outside the  periods in which it is perceived. It would therefore result from this  that this separation between existence and perception might be made,  when it is admitted (contrary to the idealist hypothesis) that the  object perceived is material and the consciousness which perceives it  mental. In this case, it will be thought, there is no link of  solidarity between the consciousness and its continuity. But I am not  of that opinion. The union of the consciousness and its object is one  of fact, which presents itself outside any hypothesis on the nature of  the object. It is observation which demonstrates to us that we must  perceive an object to be assured of its existence; the reason,  moreover, confirms the necessity of this condition, which remains true  whatever may be the \"stuff\" of the object.    Having stated this, the question is simply to know whether this  observation of fact should be generalised or not. We may, it seems to  me, decline to generalise it without falling into a contradiction in  terms. It may be conceived that the objects which we are looking at  continue to exist, without change, during the moments when we have  lost sight of them. This seems reasonable enough, and is the opinion  of \"common\" sense.[30]    The English philosophers, Bain and Mill, have combated this  proposition with extraordinary ardour, like believers combating a  heresy. But notwithstanding their attacks it remains intelligible, and  the distinction between _being_ and _being perceived_ preserves its  logical legitimacy. This may be represented, or may be thought; but  can it be realised?    So far as regards external objects, I think we all, in fact, admit it.  We all admit a distinction, between the existence of the outer world  and the perception we have of it; its existence is one thing, and our  perception of it is another. The existence of the world continues  without interruption; our perception is continually interrupted by the  most fortuitous causes, such as change of position, or even the  blinking of the eyes; its existence is general, universal, independent  of time and space; our perception is partial, particular, local,  limited by the horizon of our senses, determined by the geographical  position of our bodies, riddled by the distractions of our  intelligence, deceived by the illusions of our minds, and above all  diminished by the infirmity of our intelligence, which is able to  comprehend so little of what it perceives. This is what we all admit  in practice; the smallest of our acts implies the belief in something  perceptible which is wider and more durable than our astonished  perceptions. I could not write these lines unless I implicitly  supposed that my inkstand, my paper, my pen, my room, and the  surrounding world subsist when I do not see them. It is a postulate of  practical life. It is also a postulate of science, which requires for  its explanations of phenomena the supposition in them of an indwelling  continuity. Natural science would become unintelligible if we were  forced to suppose that with every eclipse of our perceptions material  actions were suspended. There would be beginnings without sequences,  and ends without beginnings.    Let us note also that acquired notions on the working of our nervous  system allow us to give this postulate a most precise form: the  external object is distinct from the nervous system and from the  phenomena of perception which are produced when the nervous system is  excited; it is therefore very easy to understand that this object  continues to exist and to develop its properties, even when no brain  vibrates in its neighbourhood.    Might we not, with the view of strengthening this conclusion as to  the continuous existence of things, dispense with this postulate,  which seems to have the character of a grace, of an alms granted to  us? Might not this continuous existence of objects during the eclipses  of our acts of consciousness, be demonstrated? It does not seem to me  impossible. Let us suppose for a moment the correctness of the  idealist thesis: all our legitimate knowledge of objects is contained  within the narrow limits of actual sensation; then, we may ask, of  what use is the reason? What is the use of the memory? These functions  have precisely for their object the enlarging of the sphere of our  sensations, which is limited in two principal ways, by time and by  space. Thanks to the reason, we manage to see in some way that which  our senses are unable to perceive, either because it is too distant  from us, or because there are obstacles between us and the object, or  because it is a past event or an event which has not yet taken place  which is in question.    That the reason may be deceived is agreed. But will it be asserted  that it is always deceived? Shall we go so far as to believe that this  is an illegitimate mode of cognition? The idealist thesis, if  consistent, cannot refuse to extend itself to this extreme conclusion;  for a reasoned conclusion contains, when it has a meaning, a certain  assertion on the order of nature, and this assertion is not a  perception, since its precise object is to fill up the gaps in our  perceptions. Not being a perception, it must be rejected, if one is an  idealist.    The idealist will therefore keep strictly to the perception of the  moment, and this is so small a thing when deprived of all the  conjectures which enrich it, that the world, if reduced to this alone,  would be but the skeleton of a world. There would then be no more  science, no possibility of knowledge. But who could make up his mind  thus to shut himself up in perception?    I suppose, indeed, that there will here be quibbling. This objection  will be made: that in the hypothesis of a discontinuous existence of  things, reason may continue to do its work, provided the intervention  of a possible perception be supposed. Thus, I notice this morning, on  going into my garden, that the pond which was dry yesterday is full of  water. I conclude from this, \"It has rained in the night.\" To be  consistent with idealism, one must simply add: \"If some one had been  in the garden last night, he would have seen it rain.\" In this manner  one must re-establish every time the rights of perception.    Be it so. But let us notice that this addition has no more importance  than a prescribed formula in a notarial act; for instance, the  presence of a second notary prescribed by the law, but always  dispensed with in practice. This prescribed formula can always be  imagined or even understood. We shall be in accord with idealism by  the use of this easy little formula, \"If some one had been there,\" or  even by saying, \"For a universal consciousness....\" The difference of  the realist and idealist theory becomes then purely verbal. This  amounts to saying that it disappears. But there is always much  verbalism in idealism.    One more objection: if this witness--the consciousness--suffices to  give objects a continuity of existence, we may content ourselves with  a less important witness. Why a man? The eyes of a mollusc would  suffice, or those of infusoria, or even of a particle of protoplasm:  living matter would become a condition of the existence of dead  matter. This, we must acknowledge, is a singular condition, and this  conclusion condemns the doctrine.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 30: That is to say, the sense of the multitude.--ED.]          CHAPTER VIII    DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS--THE SEPARATION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS  FROM ITS OBJECT--THE UNCONSCIOUS      I ask myself whether it is possible, by going further along this road  of the separation between the consciousness and its object, to admit  that ideas may subsist during the periods when we are not conscious of  them. It is the problem of unconsciousness that I am here stating.    One of the most simple processes of reasoning consists in treating  ideas in the same manner as we have treated the external objects. We  have admitted that the consciousness is a thing superadded to the  external objects, like the light which lights up a landscape, but does  not constitute it and may be extinguished without destroying it. We  continue the same interpretation by saying that ideas prolong their  existence while they are not being thought, in the same way and for  the same motive that material bodies continue theirs while they are  not being perceived. All that it seems permissible to say is that this  conception is not unrealisable.    Let us now place ourselves at the point of view of the consciousness.  We have supposed up to the present the suppression of the  consciousness, and have seen that we can still"]]]
