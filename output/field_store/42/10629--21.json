That it places the boys in front where their less       developed voices and often smaller numbers will insure       better balance,[23] and where also the teacher can more       easily see what is going on in their midst.         2. It places all the boys in the same part of the room and       thus removes the chief objection that boys with unchanged       voices make to singing soprano and alto. There will probably       not be a great number of these unchanged voices in any       ordinary high school chorus, but there are almost certain to       be a few, and these few should not be attempting to sing       tenor or bass when their voice-range is still that of       soprano or alto.         3. By placing the _mezzo_ voices (of which variety there are       usually more than of any other) between the sopranos and       altos, they can be used on either the soprano or alto part,       as may be necessitated by the range and dynamic demands of       the composition in hand. In seating these _mezzo-soprano_       girls the teacher may furthermore allow those who, although       having _mezzo_ voices, prefer to sing the alto part, to sit       on the side next to the alto section and the others on the       side next to the soprano section. If there are any boys with       unchanged voices who are _mezzo_ in range, they may be       seated directly back of the bass section, thus keeping them       in the boys' division and yet giving them an opportunity of       singing with those who have the same range as themselves.    [Footnote 23: The essentials of this same plan of seating are  recommended to adult choruses for a like reason; _viz._, in order to  enable a smaller number of men's voices to balance a larger number of  sopranos and altos by placing the men in the most prominent position,  instead of seating them back of the women, as is so frequently done.]    As will be noted in the plan, the conductor stands directly in front  of the basses, the piano being placed on either side as may be most  convenient, the pianist, of course, facing the conductor. In directing  a large chorus, it is a great advantage to have two pianos, one on  either side.          CHAPTER IX    THE COMMUNITY CHORUS CONDUCTOR      [Sidenote: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COMMUNITY MUSIC]    The recent rise of community music has evoked no little controversy as  to whether art can be made \"free as air\" and its satisfactions thrown  open to all, poor as well as rich; or whether it is by its very nature  exclusive and aristocratic and therefore necessarily to be confined  largely to the few. We are inclined to the former belief, and would  therefore express the opinion that in our efforts to bring beauty into  the lives of all the people, we are engaged in one of the most  significant musico-sociological enterprises ever inaugurated. For this  reason we shall discuss at this point ways and means of securing  satisfactory results in one of the most interesting phases of  community music, _viz._, the community chorus. The development of the  community chorus (and indeed to a certain extent, the whole movement  to bring music and the other arts into the lives of the proletariat)  is due to a combination of artistic and sociological impulses; and it  undoubtedly owes its origin and success as much to the interest in the  living and social problems of the middle and lower classes, which the  recently developed science of sociology has aroused, as it does to  purely musical impulses.    Because of the fact that community music is a sociological phenomenon  as well as an artistic one, the director of a community chorus must  possess a combination of artistic and personal traits not necessarily  present in the case of other musicians. In particular, he must be a  good mixer as well as a good musician; and if one or the other of  these qualities has to be sacrificed in some degree in favor of the  other, we should be inclined to insist first of all upon the right  sort of personal traits in the leader of community music. In order to  be really successful in working among the common people, the leader  must be one of them in all sincerity of spirit, and must be genuinely  in sympathy with their point of view. This fact is especially  pertinent in those types of work in which one deals with large masses  of men and women. The director of community singing must therefore,  first of all, be a good mob leader. But if, having met the people upon  their own level, he can now call upon his artistic instincts and his  musical training, and by means of a purely esthetic appeal raise his  crowd a degree or two higher in their appreciation of music as a fine  art, eventually perhaps finding it possible to interest them in a  higher type of music than is represented by the songs sung in this  friendly and informal way, then he has indeed performed his task with  distinction, and may well be elated over the results of his labors.    [Sidenote: THE SOCIAL EFFECT OF COMMUNITY SINGING]    One of the fundamental reasons for encouraging the use of carols at  community Christmas tree celebrations, as well as other similar forms  of group singing, is its beneficial effect upon the attitude of the  people toward one another and toward their social group or their  country. Through singing together in this informal way, each  individual in the crowd is apt to be drawn closer to the others, to  feel more interested in his neighbors; and in the case of \"sings,\"  where the dominating note is patriotism, to become imbued with a  deeper spirit of loyalty to country. In very many cases, individuals  who formerly would have nothing to do with one another have been drawn  together and have become really friendly, as the result of sitting  together at a community \"sing.\" Referring to the effect of the first  \"Song and Light Festival\" in New York City, a well-known artist  remarked:[24]         The movement illustrates plainly to me the coming forth of a       new consciousness. Outside the park, strikes, sedition,       anarchy, hatred, malice, envy; within, beauty, peace, the       sense of brotherhood and harmony.... Community singing is       teaching men to find themselves, and to do it in unity and       brotherly love.    [Footnote 24: Kitty Cheatham, _Musical America_, October 7, 1916.]    This same sort of an effect has been noted by us and by innumerable  others in many other places, and various testimonies to the beneficial  social effect of community singing, neighborhood bands, school  orchestras, children's concerts, and similar types of musical activity  have come from all parts of the country since the inception of the  movement.    The impulse to bring music into the lives of all the people is not a  fad, but is the result of the working out of a deep-seated and  tremendously significant innate tendency--the instinct for  self-expression; the same instinct which in another form is making us  all feel that democracy is the only sure road to ultimate satisfaction  and happiness. It behooves the musician, therefore, to study the  underlying bases of the community music movement, and to use this new  tool that has been thus providentially thrown into his hands for the  advancement of art appreciation, rather than to stand aloof and scoff  at certain imperfections and crudities which inevitably are only too  evident in the present phase of the movement.    [Sidenote: QUALITIES OF THE COMMUNITY SONG LEADER]    If the social benefit referred to above,--_viz._, the growth of group  feeling and of neighborly interest in one's fellows, is to result from  our community singing, we must first of all have leaders who are able  to make people feel cheerful and at ease. The community song leader  must be able to raise a hearty laugh occasionally, and he must by the  magnetism of his personality be able to make men and women who have  not raised their voices in song for years past forget their shyness,  forget to be afraid of the sound of their own voices, forget to wonder  whether anyone is listening, and join heartily in the singing.    There is no one way of securing this result; in fact, the same leader  often finds it necessary to use different tactics in dealing with  different crowds, or for that matter, different methods with the same  crowd at different times. The crux of the matter is that the leader  must in some way succeed in breaking up the formality, the stiffness  of the occasion; must get the crowd to loosen up in their attitude  toward him, toward one another, and toward singing. This can often be  accomplished by making a pointed remark or two about the song, and  thus, by concentrating the attention upon the meaning of the words,  make the singers forget themselves. Sometimes having various sections  of the crowd sing different stanzas, or different parts of a stanza  antiphonally will bring the desired result. By way of variety, also,  the women may be asked to sing the verse while the entire chorus joins  in the refrain; or the men and women may alternate in singing stanzas;  or those in the back of the balcony may repeat the refrain as an echo;  or the leader and the crowd may sing antiphonally. In these various  ways, considerable rivalry may be aroused in the various"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22396"],[0,"King Arthur's Knights (#17)"],[1,"voice. 'I will  talk no more with thee.'    With that they withdrew a little from each other, and then, spurring  their horses, and with lances in rest, they hurled themselves towards  each other. With so great a crash did they come together that both  their spears were broken into a hundred pieces, and their breastplates,  girths and cruppers burst, and the two knights fell to the ground half  stunned with the shock.    But in a little while they avoided their struggling horses, and leaping  towards each other with their swords, they cut and hacked each the  other so fiercely that great pieces of their shields and armour flew  off.    Thus they fought till it was past noon, and would not stop, till at  last they both lacked wind, and thus they stood swaying, staggering,  panting, yet feinting and striking with what strength they had. The Red  Knight was a cunning fighter, and Beaumains learned much from him,  though it was at the cost of many a gaping wound.    When it was evensong they rested by mutual accord, and seated on two  molehills near the fighting place, they had their helms taken off by  their pages and their worse wounds bound up. Then Beaumains lifted up  his eyes to the lady at the window, and saw how her looks were tender  with pity for him.    So heartened was he at the sight that he started up swiftly, and bade  the Red Knight make him ready to do battle once more to the uttermost.  Then they rushed fiercely at each other, and the fight raged more hotly  than ever. At length, by cunning, the Red Knight suddenly struck  Beaumains' sword from his hand, and before he could recover it, the Red  Knight had with a great buffet thrown him to the ground, and had fallen  upon him to keep him down.    Then cried the Lady Linet piteously:    'O Sir Beaumains! Sir Beaumains! where is your great heart? My lady  sister beholds you, and she sobs and weeps, for surely she feels the  evil Red Knight hath her almost in his power!'    At that, so great a rage possessed Beaumains, that with one great  effort he thrust the Red Knight from him, and, leaping up, he seized  his sword again, and so fiercely did he beat upon his enemy that the  Red Knight sank to his knees, and then was thrust grovelling to the  ground.    Beaumains leaped astride him, and cut the fastenings of his helm. Then  the Red Knight shrieked for mercy.    'Thou recreant and coward!' said Beaumains. 'Did not any of those  knights that thou hast hung cry to thee for mercy? What pity and what  mercy didst thou give them? And thou deservest none from me, nor from  any man!'    With that he slew him at a stroke, and the people in the castle cried  out with joy.    Their leader being dead, his following of earls, barons and knights  came and did homage to Beaumains, and he commanded that instantly they  should betake themselves to the court of King Arthur and yield them  into his hands.    Then for ten days the Lady Linet made Beaumains rest him in the Red  Knight's tent, while she tended his many sore wounds. But ever  Beaumains desired to go into the castle to see the lady he loved, but  his hurts forbade him.    On the eleventh day he would no longer be denied, but having armed  himself, all except his helm, which his page carried, he rode up to the  castle gate. But as he came thither he saw many armed men, who pulled  up the drawbridge before him, so that he should not enter.    Therewith he saw a knight at a window, who called to him.    'Fair sir, I am Sir Gringamor, brother to the Lady Lyones,' said the  knight. 'I will that ye enter not yet. We know that you have proved  yourself a bold and brave fighter, but we know not who you are.  Therefore, unless you tell me your name and kindred, I may not suffer  my sister to see you.'    'I know naught of thee, sir knight,' cried Beaumains sternly. 'My  business is with the lady, from whom I think I deserve a little  kindness, for I have bought her deliverance and her love with some of  the best blood in my body. Must I go away then, thinking she cares more  for a name and noble lineage than for brave deeds and devotion? Tell  me, Sir Gringamor, is this the will of the Lady Lyones?'    'Ye have but to tell us thy name and of thy lineage, brave man,' said  Sir Gringamor.    'Nay, that I will not!' said Beaumains, for his heart was hot with  shame and anger. 'If I were but a churl, I should reckon myself a  nobler man than the recreant knight from whom I have rescued you and  your sister. But since he was a knight, it seems ye would reckon him as  of greater honour than the brave churl that slew him for his evil  deeds.'    'Nay, nay, it is not so!' came a sweet voice crying in tears, and Sir  Beaumains saw the tender face of the Lady Lyones at the window where  Sir Gringamor had been. 'My brave knight, think not ill of me, for this  is none of my will, for I am mocked and my pleasure denied in my own  castle by this my over-careful brother. I love thee, sir knight,  whatsoever thou art, for I feel that thou art gentle and brave, and as  good a man as any lady might love. And I beg you go not far from me,  for I will have my will erelong, and I tell you now that I trust you,  and I shall be true to you, and unto my death I shall love you and no  other. And whenever I may come to you I will, in spite of this my  brother.'    Saying these words, the lady sobbed as if her heart would break, and  hiding her face in her hands she was led away by her women.    With that Beaumains' heart smote him, and he was resolved to reveal his  name and lineage for the sake of the dear lady who loved him. But even  as he thought this, he was aware of a party of knights coming towards  him from the plain, and soon he recognised that they were of the  company of King Arthur's Round Table.    And the foremost knight, who bore his helm in his hand, rode forward to  him, crying:    'O Gareth, Gareth, my brother, how hast thou deceived us all!'    Then did Sir Beaumains clasp the other's hand right warmly, for this  was his own brother, Sir Gaheris, sent from King Arthur to bring him  home.    When Sir Gringamor knew of the coming of these knights, quickly he bade  the drawbridge to be lowered, and in a little while the knights were  being welcomed in the hall.    'Sir Gringamor,' said Sir Gaheris, 'I find that I come at a lucky  chance for the happiness of my brother. Already the fame of his brave  deeds has reached King Arthur, for the knights he hath overcome have  put themselves in the mercy of the king.'    'Sir Knight of the Round Table,' said Sir Gringamor, 'tell me who is  this brave knight that will not say his name?'    'He is Sir Gareth, my brother, the youngest son of the King of Orkney,'  replied Sir Gaheris, 'and fit for the highest lady in the land. He hath  played this trick upon us all, to test us. We did not know him, for he  hath grown up to manhood while we have been long away from home. But  ever he hath had an adventurous and witty mind.'    'Sir, I thank you,' said Sir Gringamor, and taking Sir Gareth by the  hand he led him into the bower where sat the Lady Lyones, who sprang to  meet Sir Gareth. To her Sir Gringamor told all that he had heard, and  then left Sir Gareth to tell her more of himself.    And in a little while, at the court of King Arthur, they were married  with great feastings and joustings and with all things to make merry.  And Linet was wedded at the same time to Sir Gaheris. For though the  Lady Linet was sharp of tongue, she was of great and good heart, and  well beloved of all who knew her well.          V    HOW SIR TRISTRAM KEPT HIS WORD      In the days when King Arthur had established his kingdom, he was called  Emperor of Britain and its three islands. Nevertheless, there were  kings who were rulers in their own lands, but they held their  sovereignty of Arthur and had done homage to him and sworn fealty. In  Wales there were two kings, in the north were eleven kings, and these  he had conquered in a great battle by Sherwood Forest; in Cornwall were  two kings, and in Ireland three kings, but all gave service to the  great King Arthur.    That part of Cornwall which was called the lands of Tintagel formed the  kingdom of a prince named Mark, and he owed certain yearly tribute or  truage to King Anguish of South Ireland. It befell one day that King  Anguish sent a messenger, who came to King Mark as he sat in hall, and  said:    'Sir king, my master bids me say that the truage which you owe unto him  is unpaid for seven years past, and if it be not paid he will demand of  you double the sum.'    Now King Mark was a man of a mean and covetous mind, and he loved not  to give money. Therefore, to put off the payment for a little while, he  made answer thus:    'Tell your master that we will pay him no truage; and if your lord says  he will have it, let him send a trusty knight of his land that will  fight for his right, and we will find another to do battle with him.'    When King Anguish heard the message he was wondrous wroth, and called  into him the brother of his queen, Sir Marhaus, a good knight of  prowess nobly proved, and, besides, a knight of the Round Table. The  king craved of him to go and do battle for the truage due from Mark of  Cornwall.    'Sir,' said Sir Marhaus, 'I will gladly go and do battle for you on  this saucy king or his knight. I ween ye shall have your truage to the  last groat, for I fear not the best knight of the Round Table, unless  it be Sir Lancelot, and I doubt not King Mark hath no knight of such  worth and prowess as I.'    So in all haste Sir Marhaus set forth in a ship, and in a little while  cast anchor fast by the shore where, on two high cliffs, the castle of  Tintagel frowned upon the sea. When King Mark understood that so noble  a knight as Sir Marhaus had come to do battle for the truage, he was  full of sorrow, and wept as he looked upon the bags of gold in his  treasure-chest. He knew of no knight of his court that durst"]]]
