All the festivals of the Church are preceded by a vigil, or eve, and,  considering the magnitude of the festival of Christmas, it is no  wonder that the ceremonial attaching to the eve of the Nativity  outvies all others. What sings old Herrick of it?           Come, bring with a noise,         My merrie, merrie boyes,       The Christmas Log to the firing;         While my good Dame, she         Bids ye all be free;       And drink to your hearts' desiring.           With the last yeere's brand,         Light the new block, And       For good successe in his spending,         On your Psalterie play,         That sweet luck may       Come while the Log is teending.[36]           Drink now the strong Beere,         Cut the white loafe heere,       The while the meat is a shredding;         For the rare Mince pie,         And the Plums stand by       To fill the Paste that's a-kneading.    [Footnote 36: Lighting, burning.]    Bringing in the Yule log, clog, or block--for it is indifferently  called by any of these names, was a great function on Christmas  eve--and much superstitious reverence was paid to it, in order to  insure good luck for the coming year. It had to be lit \"with the last  yeere's brand,\" and Herrick gives the following instructions in _The  Ceremonies for Candlemasse day_.         Kindle the Christmas Brand, and then         Till Sunne-set, let it burne;       Which quencht, then lay it up agen,         Till Christmas next returne.         Part must be kept, wherewith to teend         The Christmas Log next yeare;       And, where 'tis safely kept, the Fiend         Can do no mischief there.    But, even if lit with the remains of last year's log, it seems to be  insufficient, unless the advice to the maids who light it be followed.         Wash your hands, or else the fire       Will not teend to your desire;       Unwasht hands, ye Maidens, know,       Dead the Fire, though ye blow.    In some parts of Devonshire a curious custom in connection with the  Yule log is still kept up, that of burning the Ashton or ashen faggot.  It is well described by a writer in _Notes and Queries_.[37]    [Footnote 37: Sixth series, vol. ii. p. 508.]    \"Of the olden customs, so many of which are dying out, that of burning  an 'ashen faggot' on Christmas Eve, still holds its own, and is kept  up at many farm houses.    \"Among the various gleanings of the Devon Association Folk-Lore  Committee is recorded a notice of this custom. We are there informed  that, on Christmas eve, 1878, the customary faggot was burned at  _thirty-two_ farms and cottages in the Ashburton postal district  alone.    \"The details of the observance vary in different families; but some,  being common to all, may be considered as held necessary to the due  performance of the rite. For example, the faggot must contain as  large a log of ash as possible, usually the trunk of a tree, remnants  of which are supposed to continue smouldering on the hearth the whole  of the twelve days of Christmas. This is the Yule dog of our  forefathers, from which a fire can be raised by the aid of a pair of  bellows, at any moment day or night, in token of the ancient custom of  open hospitality at such a season. Then the faggot must be bound  together with as many binders of twisted hazel as possible.  Remembering that the Ash and Hazel were sacred trees with the  Scandinavians, their combined presence in forming the faggot may once  have contained some mystic signification. Also, as each binder is  burned through, a quart of cider is claimed by the Company. By this,  some hidden connexion between the pleasures of the party and the  loosening bands of the faggot is typified. While the fire lasts, all  sorts of amusements are indulged in--all distinction between master  and servant, neighbour and visitor, is for the time set aside.         \"The heir, with roses in his shoes,       That night might village partner choose;       The lord, underogating, share       The vulgar game of 'post and pair.'       All hailed, with uncontrolled delight,       And general voice, the happy night,       That to the cottage, as the crown,       Brought tidings of Salvation down.    \"In some houses, when the faggot begins to burn up, a young child is  placed on it, and his future pluck foretold by his nerve or timidity.  May not this be a remnant of the dedication of children to the Deity  by passing them through the sacred fire?    \"Different reasons are given for burning Ash. By some, it is said that  when our Saviour was born, Joseph cut a bundle of Ash, which, every  one knows, burns very well when green; that, by this, was lighted a  fire, by which He was first dressed in swaddling clothes.    \"The gipsies have a legend that our Saviour was born out in a field  like themselves, and brought up by an Ash fire. The holly, ivy, and  pine, they say, hid him, and so, now, are always green, whilst the ash  and the oak showed where He was hiding, and they remain dead all the  winter. Therefore the gipsies burn Ash at Christmas.    \"We can well understand how the pleasures of the ashen faggot are  looked forward to with delight by the hard-working agricultural  labourer, for whom few social enjoyments are provided. The harvest  home, in these days of machinery, seems lost in the usual routine of  work, and the shearing feast, when held, is confined to the farmer's  family, or shepherd staff, and is not a general gathering. Moreover,  these take place in the long busy days of summer, when extra hands and  strangers are about the farm doing job work. But, with Christmas,  things are different. Work is scarce; only the regular hands are on  the farm, and there is nothing to prevent following out the good old  custom of our ancestors, of feasting, for once, those among whom one's  lot is cast.         \"England was Merry England, when       Old Christmas brought his sports again.       'Twas Christmas broached the mightiest ale;       'Twas Christmas told the merriest tale:       A Christmas gambol oft could cheer       The poor man's heart through half the year.\"    To add to the festivity and light, large candles are burnt, the bigger  the better; but, as the custom of keeping Christmas descended from  \"Children of a larger growth\" to those of lesser, so did the size of  the candles decrease in proportion, until they reached the minimum at  which we now know them. In the Isle of Man they had a custom which  has, probably, dropped into desuetude, of all going to church on  Christmas eve, each bearing the largest candle procurable. The  churches were well decorated with holly, and the service, in  commemoration of the Nativity, was called _Oiel Verry_. Waldron, in  his _Description of the Isle of Man_, says, \"On the 24th of December,  towards evening, all the servants in general have a holiday; they go  not to bed all night, but ramble about till the bells ring in all the  churches, which is at twelve o'clock: prayers being over, they go to  hunt the wren; and, after having found one of these poor birds, they  kill her and lay her on a bier, with the utmost solemnity, bringing  her to the parish church, and burying her with a whimsical kind of  solemnity, singing dirges over her in the Manks language, which they  call her knell; after which Christmas begins.\"    There are many peculiar customs appertaining to Christmas eve. Burton,  in his _Anatomy of Melancholy_, says, \"'Tis their only desire, if it  may be done by art, to see their husband's picture in a glass; they'll  give anything to know when they shall be married; how many husbands  they shall have, by _Cromnyomantia_, a kind of divination, with onions  laid on the altar at Christmas eve.\" This seems to be something like  that which we have seen practised on St. Thomas's day--or that  described in Googe's _Popish Kingdome_.         In these same days, young wanton gyrles that meet for marriage be,       Doe search to know the names of them that shall their husbands be;       Four onyons, five, or eight, they take, and make in every one       Such names as they doe fancie most, and best to think upon.       Then near the chimney them they set, and that same onyon then       That firste doth sproute doth surely beare the name of their good man.    In Northamptonshire another kind of divination, with the same object,  used to be practised: the girl who was anxious to ascertain her lot in  the married state, went into the garden and plucked twelve sage  leaves, under the firm conviction that she would be favoured with a  glimpse of the shadowy form of her future husband as he approached her  from the opposite end of the ground; but she had to take great care  not to damage or break the sage stock, otherwise the consequences  would be fearful. But then, in this county, the ghosts of people who  had been buried at cross roads had liberty to walk about and show  themselves on Christmas eve, so that the country folk did not care to  stir out more than necessary on the vigil. At Walton-le-Dale, in  Lancashire, the inmates of most of the houses sat up on Christmas eve,  with their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#17)"],[1,"on the race-horse or the  gambling-table, to that noble life-race, that holy life-hazard, which  should win all glory to himself and all good to his country,--would not  that, to some purpose, be \"political economy of art\"?      109. And observe, there could be no monotony, no exhaustibleness, in the  scenes required to be thus portrayed. Even if there were, and you  wanted for every school in the kingdom, one death of Leonidas; one  battle of Marathon; one death of Cleobis and Bito; there need not  therefore be more monotony in your art than there was in the repetition  of a given cycle of subjects by the religious painters of Italy. But we  ought not to admit a cycle at all. For though we had as many great  schools as we have great cities (one day I hope we _shall_ have),  centuries of painting would not exhaust, in all the number of them, the  noble and pathetic subjects which might be chosen from the history of  even one noble nation. But, beside this, you will not, in a little  while, limit your youths' studies to so narrow fields as you do now.  There will come a time--I am sure of it--when it will be found that the  same practical results, both in mental discipline and in political  philosophy, are to be attained by the accurate study of mediaeval and  modern as of ancient history; and that the facts of mediaeval and modern  history are, on the whole, the most important to us. And among these  noble groups of constellated schools which I foresee arising in our  England, I foresee also that there will be divided fields of thought;  and that while each will give its scholars a great general idea of the  world's history, such as all men should possess--each will also take  upon itself, as its own special duty, the closer study of the course of  events in some given place or time. It will review the rest of history,  but it will exhaust its own special field of it; and found its moral and  political teaching on the most perfect possible analysis of the results  of human conduct in one place, and at one epoch. And then, the galleries  of that school will be painted with the historical scenes belonging to  the age which it has chosen for its special study.      110. So far, then, of art as you may apply it to that great series of  public buildings which you devote to the education of youth. The next  large class of public buildings in which we should introduce it, is one  which I think a few years more of national progress will render more  serviceable to us than they have been lately. I mean, buildings for the  meetings of guilds of trades.    And here, for the last time, I must again interrupt the course of our  chief inquiry, in order to state one other principle of political  economy, which is perfectly simple and indisputable; but which,  nevertheless, we continually get into commercial embarrassments for want  of understanding; and not only so, but suffer much hindrance in our  commercial discoveries, because many of our business men do not  practically admit it.    Supposing half a dozen or a dozen men were cast ashore from a wreck on  an uninhabited island, and left to their own resources, one of course,  according to his capacity, would be set to one business and one to  another; the strongest to dig and cut wood, and to build huts for the  rest: the most dexterous to make shoes out of bark and coats out of  skins; the best educated to look for iron or lead in the rocks, and to  plan the channels for the irrigation of the fields. But though their  labours were thus naturally severed, that small group of shipwrecked men  would understand well enough that the speediest progress was to be made  by helping each other,--not by opposing each other: and they would know  that this help could only be properly given so long as they were frank  and open in their relations, and the difficulties which each lay under  properly explained to the rest. So that any appearance of secrecy or  separateness in the actions of any of them would instantly, and justly,  be looked upon with suspicion by the rest, as the sign of some selfish  or foolish proceeding on the part of the individual. If, for instance,  the scientific man were found to have gone out at night, unknown to the  rest, to alter the sluices, the others would think, and in all  probability rightly think, that he wanted to get the best supply of  water to his own field; and if the shoemaker refused to show them where  the bark grew which he made the sandals of, they would naturally think,  and in all probability rightly think, that he didn't want them to see  how much there was of it, and that he meant to ask from them more corn  and potatoes in exchange for his sandals than the trouble of making them  deserved. And thus, although each man would have a portion of time to  himself in which he was allowed to do what he chose without let or  inquiry,--so long as he was working in that particular business which he  had undertaken for the common benefit, any secrecy on his part would be  immediately supposed to mean mischief; and would require to be accounted  for, or put an end to: and this all the more because whatever the work  might be, certainly there would be difficulties about it which, when  once they were well explained, might be more or less done away with by  the help of the rest; so that assuredly every one of them would advance  with his labour not only more happily, but more profitably and quickly,  by having no secrets, and by frankly bestowing, and frankly receiving,  such help as lay in his way to get or to give.      111. And, just as the best and richest result of wealth and happiness to  the whole of them would follow on their perseverance in such a system of  frank communication and of helpful labour;--so precisely the worst and  poorest result would be obtained by a system of secrecy and of enmity;  and each man's happiness and wealth would assuredly be diminished in  proportion to the degree in which jealousy and concealment became their  social and economical principles. It would not, in the long run, bring  good, but only evil, to the man of science, if, instead of telling  openly where he had found good iron, he carefully concealed every new  bed of it, that he might ask, in exchange for the rare ploughshare, more  corn from the farmer, or, in exchange for the rude needle, more labour  from the sempstress: and it would not ultimately bring good, but only  evil, to the farmers, if they sought to burn each other's cornstacks,  that they might raise the value of their grain, or if the sempstresses  tried to break each other's needles, that each might get all the  stitching to herself.      112. Now, these laws of human action are precisely as authoritative in  their application to the conduct of a million of men, as to that of six  or twelve. All enmity, jealousy, opposition, and secrecy are wholly, and  in all circumstances, destructive in their nature--not productive; and  all kindness, fellowship, and communicativeness are invariably  productive in their operation,--not destructive; and the evil principles  of opposition and exclusiveness are not rendered less fatal, but more  fatal, by their acceptance among large masses of men; more fatal, I say,  exactly in proportion as their influence is more secret. For though the  opposition does always its own simple, necessary, direct quantity of  harm, and withdraws always its own simple, necessary, measurable  quantity of wealth from the sum possessed by the community, yet, in  proportion to the size of the community, it does another and more  refined mischief than this, by concealing its own fatality under aspects  of mercantile complication and expediency, and giving rise to multitudes  of false theories based on a mean belief in narrow and immediate  appearances of good done here and there by things which have the  universal and everlasting nature of evil. So that the time and powers of  the nation are wasted, not only in wretched struggling against each  other, but in vain complaints, and groundless discouragements, and empty  investigations, and useless experiments in laws, and elections, and  inventions; with hope always to pull wisdom through some new-shaped slit  in a ballot-box, and to drag prosperity down out of the clouds along  some new knot of electric wire; while all the while Wisdom stands  calling at the corners of the streets, and the blessing of Heaven waits  ready to rain down upon us, deeper than the rivers and broader than the  dew, if only we will obey the first plain principles of humanity, and  the first plain precepts of the skies: \"Execute true judgment, and show  mercy and compassion, every man to his brother; and let none of you  imagine evil against his brother in your heart.\"[14]    [Note 14: It would be well if, instead of preaching continually  about the doctrine of faith and good works, our clergymen would simply  explain to their people a little what good works mean. There is not a  chapter in all the book we profess to believe, more specially and  directly written for England than the second of Habakkuk, and I never in  all my life heard one of its practical texts preached from. I suppose  the clergymen are all afraid, and know their flocks, while they will sit  quite politely to hear syllogisms out of the epistle to the Romans,  would get restive directly if they ever pressed a practical text home to  them. But we should have no mercantile catastrophes, and no distressful  pauperism, if we only read often, and took to heart, those plain  words:--\"Yea, also, because he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home,  who enlargeth his desire as hell, and cannot be satisfied,--Shall not  all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against  him, and say, 'Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his: and to  him that _ladeth himself with thick clay_'?\" (What a glorious history in  one metaphor, of the life of a man greedy of fortune!) \"W"]]]
