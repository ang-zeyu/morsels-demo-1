Was it a  signal or merely a device to threaten a possible enemy?    There were sails, now furled as this ship bored on, answering to the  steady throb of what could only be an engine. And his puzzlement held. A  Viking longboat powered by motor? The mixture was incongruous.    The crew were uniform as to face. All of them wore the flexible pearly  armor, the skull-strip helmets. Though there were individual differences  in ornaments and the choice of weapons. The majority of the men did  carry curve-pointed swords, though those were broader and heavier than  those the Terran had seen ashore. But several had axes with  sickle-shaped heads, whose points curved so far back that they nearly  met to form a circle.    Spaced at regular intervals on deck were boxlike objects fronting what  resembled gun ports. And smaller ones of the same type were on the  raised deck at the stern and mounted in the prow, their muzzles, if the  square fronts might be deemed muzzles, flanking the blinking dragon  head. Catapults of some type? Ross wondered.    \"Rosss--\" His name was given the hiss Loketh used, but it was not the  Wrecker youth who joined him now at the stern of the ship. \"Ho ... that  was strong magic, that fighting knowledge of yours!\"    Vistur rubbed his chest reminiscently. \"You have big magic, sea man. But  then you serve the Maid, do you not? Your swordsman has told us that  even the great fish understand and obey her.\"    \"Some fish,\" qualified Ross.    \"Such fish as that, perhaps?\" Vistur pointed to the curling wake of  foam.    Startled, Ross stared in that direction. Torgul's command was the  centermost in a trio of ships, and those cruised in a line, leaving  three trails of troubled wave behind them. Coming up now to port in the  comparative calm between two wakes was a dark object. In the limited  light Ross could be sure of nothing save that it trailed the ships,  appeared to rest on or only lightly in the water, and that its speed was  less than that of the vessels it doggedly pursued.    \"A fish--that?\" Ross asked.    \"Watch!\" Vistur ordered.    But the Hawaikan's sight must have been keener than the Terran's. Had  there been a quick movement back there? Ross could not be sure.    \"What happened?\" He turned to Vistur for enlightenment.    \"As a salkar it leaps now and then above the surface. But that is no  salkar. Unless, Ross, you who say you are from the sea have servants  unlike any finned one we have drawn in by net or line before this day.\"    The dolphins! Could Tino-rau or Taua or both be in steady pursuit of the  ships? But Karara ... Ross leaned against the rail, stared until his  eyes began to water from the strain of trying to make out the nature of  the black blot. No use, the distance was too great. He brought his fist  down against the wood, trying to control his impatience. More than half  of him wanted to burst into Torgul's quarters, demand that the Captain  bring the ship about to pick up or contact that trailer or trailers.    \"Yours?\" again Vistur asked.    Ross had tight rein on himself now. \"I do not know. It could well be.\"    It could well be also that the smart thing would be to encourage the  Rovers to believe that he had a force of sea dwellers much larger than  the four Time castaways. The leader of an army--or a navy--had more  prestige in any truce discussion than a member of a lost scouting party.  But the thought that the dolphins could be trailing held both promise  and worry--promise of allies, and worry over what had happened to  Karara. Had she, too, disappeared after Ashe into the hold of the  Foanna?    The day did not continue to lighten. Though there was no cottony mist as  had enclosed them the night before, there was an odd muting of sea and  sky, limiting vision. Shortly Ross was unable to sight the follower or  followers. Even Vistur admitted he had lost visual contact. Had the blot  been hopelessly outdistanced, or was it still dogging the wakes of the  Rover ships?    Ross shared the morning meal with Captain Torgul, a round of leathery  substance with a salty, meaty flavor, and a thick mixture of what might  be native fruit reduced to a tart paste. Once before he had tasted alien  food when in the derelict spaceship it had meant eat or starve. And this  was a like circumstance, since their emergency ration supplies had been  lost in the net. But though he was apprehensive, no ill effects  followed. Torgul had been uncommunicative earlier; now he was looser of  tongue, volunteering that they were almost to their port--the fairing of  Kyn Add.    The Terran had no idea how far he might question the Hawaikan, yet the  fuller his information the better. He discovered that Torgul appeared  willing to accept Ross's statement that he was from a distant part of  the sea and that local customs differed from those he knew.    Living on and by the sea the Rovers were quick-witted, adaptive, with a  highly flexible if loose-knit organization of fleet-clans. Each of these  had control over certain islands which served them as \"fairings,\" ports  for refitting and anchorage between voyages, usually ruggedly wooded  where the sea people could find the raw material for their ships.  Colonies of clans took to the sea, not in the slim, swift cruisers like  the ship Ross was now on, but in larger, deeper vessels providing living  quarters and warehouses afloat. They lived by trade and raiding,  spending only a portion of the year ashore to grow fast-sprouting crops  on their fairing islands and indulge in some manufacture of articles the  inhabitants of the larger and more heavily populated islands were not  able to duplicate.    Their main article of commerce was, however, a sea-dwelling creature  whose supple and well-tanned hide formed their defensive armor and  served manifold other uses. This could only be hunted by men trained and  fearless enough to brave more than one danger Torgul did not explain in  detail. And a cargo of such skins brought enough in trade to keep a  normal-sized fleet-clan for a year.    There was warfare among them. Rival clans tried to jump each other's  hunting territories, raid fairings. But until the immediate past, Ross  gathered, such encounters were relatively bloodless affairs, depending  more upon craft and skillful planning to reduce the enemy to a position  of disadvantage in which he was forced to acknowledge defeat, rather  than ruthless battle of no quarter.    The shore-side Wrecker lords were always considered fair game, and there  was no finesse in Rover raids upon them. Those were conducted with a  cold-blooded determination to strike hard at a long-time foe. However,  within the past year there had been several raids on fairings with the  same blood-bath result of a foray on a Wrecker port. And, since all the  fleet-clans denied the sneak-and-strike, kill-and-destroy tactics which  had finished those Rover holdings, the seafarers were divided in their  opinion as to whether the murderous raids were the work of Wreckers  suddenly acting out of character and taking to the sea to bring war back  to their enemies, or whether there was a rogue fleet moving against  their own kind for some purpose no Rover could yet guess.    \"And you believe?\" Ross asked as Torgul finished his resume of the new  dangers besetting his people.    Torgul's hand, its long, slender fingers spidery to Terran eyes, rubbed  back and forth across his chin before he answered:    \"It is very hard for one who has fought them long to believe that  suddenly those shore rats are entrusting themselves to the waves,  venturing out to stir us with their swords. One does not descend into  the depths to kick a salkar in the rump; not if one still has his wits  safely encased under his skull braid. As for a rogue fleet ... what  would turn brother against brother to the extent of slaying children and  women? Raiding for a wife, yes, that is common among our youth. And  there have been killings over such matters. But not the killing of a  woman--never of a child! We are a people who have never as many women as  there are men who wish to bring them into the home cabin. And no clan  has as many children as they hope the Shades will send them.\"    \"Then who?\"    When Torgul did not answer at once Ross glanced at the Captain, and what  the Terran thought he saw showing for an instant in the other's eyes was  a revelation of danger. So much so that he blurted out:    \"You think that I--we--\"    \"You have named yourself of the sea, stranger, and you have magic which  is not ours. Tell me this in truth: Could you not have killed Vistur  easily with those two blows if you had wished it?\"    Ross took the bold course. \"Yes, but I did not. My people kill no more  wantonly than yours.\"    \"The coast rats I know, and the Foanna, as well as any man may know  their kind and ways, and my people--But you I do not know, sea stranger.  And I say to you as I have said before, make me regret that I suffered  you to claim battle rights and I shall speedily correct that mistake!\"    \"Captain!\"    That cry had come from the cabin door behind Ross. Torgul was on his  feet with the swift movements of a man called many times in the past for  an instant response to emergency.    The Terran was close on the Rover's heels as they reached the deck. A  cluster of crewmen gathered on the port side near the narrow bow. That  odd misty quality this day held provided a murk hard to pierce, but the  men were gesturing at a low-riding object rolling with the waves.    That was near enough for even Ross to be able to distinguish a small  boat akin to the one in which he, Karara, and Loketh had dared the sea  gate of the Foanna.    Torgul took up a great curved shell hanging by a thong on the mainmast.  Setting its narrow end to his lips, he blew. A weird booming note, like  the coughing of a sea monster, carried over the waves. But there was no  answer from"]]]
