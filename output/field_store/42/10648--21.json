Of the latter there are many editions.[29]    How much has been written on the Art of Reading, and what scanty  knowledge of that art have the most industrious of readers! Outside the  Universities, reading is apt nowadays to be looked upon as a light form  of recreation, generally to be indulged in on a rainy day. 'There's  nothing to do but sit indoors and read,' one frequently hears remarked in  country houses when the weather is too inclement to permit of motoring.  Novel-reading has indeed become a part of our fashionable life.    How often, too, does one come across readers of both sexes who possess,  seemingly, a wide knowledge of books, even of the great books of the  world. Yet in nine cases out of ten such knowledge is of the most  superficial kind, acquired by 'dipping into' such and such an author to  ascertain whether he be to his or her taste. Frankly, the great author is  almost invariably _not_ to the modern reader's taste; but the scanty  knowledge acquired by perusing the first chapter, the headings of the  remaining chapters, and the last chapter, enables the reader (save the  mark!) to discourse at large on this particular writer among his own  _coterie_. Perchance one of his friends has similarly insulted the great  author, and they are enabled to discuss the book for nearly a minute by  the clock, each thinking the other a devilish well-read fellow. Truly it  has been said that 'just as profligacy is easy within the strict limits  of the law, a boundless knowledge of books may be found with a narrow  education.'[30]    More rarely one comes across a man who, being the fortunate possessor of  a truly wonderful memory, is enabled to retain the bulk of the  information which he has acquired by wide reading. There is a story told  of a certain don at one of our older universities who, being possessed of  an insatiable thirst for knowledge coupled with an excellent memory and  an inexhaustible capacity for work, passed as a well-read if not a very  learned man. There seemed to be few topics upon which he could not  discourse on equal terms even with those who had made that subject their  own.    Now it happened that there were two young Fellows at the same college  who, wearied of his constant superiority in conversation, determined to  take Brown (for such was his name) 'down a peg or two.' So each night at  dinner in hall they skilfully turned the conversation to unusual topics,  hoping to light upon some chink in the redoubtable Brown's intellectual  armour. Once they tried him on the rarer British hemipterous homoptera,  but soon discovered that he was a very fair entomologist. Next evening  the conversation veered to ancient Scandinavian burial rites, but here  again he could give them points. The Byzantine coinage of Cyprus was, of  course, well known to him while he had himself worked on the oolitic  foraminifera of the blue marl at Biarritz. His experiments on the red  colouring matter of _drosera rotundifolia_ had formed the subject of a  monograph, and he was particularly interested in the hagiological  folk-lore of Lower Brittany.    It seemed almost hopeless. Try as they would they could find no subject  with which he was unacquainted. Every night some fresh outlandish topic  was introduced. Brown looked very bored, and proceeded to tell them all  there was to be said upon the subject. But one night a casual remark put  them on the right track. Someone happened to ask Brown a question about  Indian music. He answered shortly, and remarked that it was a subject  upon which a good deal of work was yet to be done. The conspirators  looked across the table at each other, left the common-room early, and  retired to Jones's rooms.    'Did you notice?' said Jones.    'Yes,' said Smith; 'he evidently doesn't know much about oriental music.'    'But he will by to-morrow,' replied the astute Jones. 'As soon as ever he  gets to his rooms to-night, he'll read up everything he possibly can on  Indian music, and he'll continue in the Library to-morrow. By dinner-time  he'll be stuffed full of tom-toms and shawms and dulcimers, or whatever  they play in India.'    'We must ride him off,' said Smith. 'How about Chinese music? He won't  know anything about that.'    This seemed such a promising topic that they got out the encyclopaedia and  found to their joy that there was quite a lengthy and learned  disquisition on the subject. So they read it again and again, even  learning the more abstruse sentences by heart. Next day they were  observed to chuckle whenever they caught each other's eye, and at lunch  they were unusually cheerful and more than ordinarily attentive to the  unsuspecting Brown.    That night at dinner they could hardly restrain their impatience, and  Smith introduced the topic, rather clumsily, as soon as the fish  appeared. Brown stared at them and said nothing. Jones, plucking up  courage, presently asked him a question about the dominant fifth of the  scale used by the natives of Quang-Tung. He answered evasively. They  could hardly conceal their delight, and their voices rose so that  presently the whole table was looking at them. At some of their recondite  utterances Brown fairly winced, and it soon became evident to all what  was afoot. Upstairs in the common-room they pursued their unhappy victim.  The senior tutor and the dean, secretly enjoying the fun, stood near. At  last, flushed with victory, Jones proceeded to administer  the _coup de grace_.    'You really ought to read something about Chinese music, Brown, it's a  most interesting topic, and I'm sure you'd like to be able to talk about  it. There are quite a number of good books on the subject. For a start  you couldn't do better than study the article in the \"Encyclopaedia  Academica.\" It's clear and concise, evidently written by a man who knows  what he's talking about.'    'I _have_ read it,' said Brown patiently; 'in fact I--er--_wrote_ it,  _but I'm afraid it's quite out of date now_.'           *       *       *       *       *    We are not all the lucky possessors of such a capacity for acquiring  knowledge. Wide reading may be good from an educational point of view,  but unless we are able to assimilate what we read better a thousand times  to restrict our reading. Gibbon's advice is bad, for it indicates merely  the system he employed in compiling his monumental work. 'We ought not,'  he remarks, 'to attend to the order of our books so much as (to the  order) of our thoughts.' So, in the midst of Homer he would skip to  Longinus; a passage in Longinus would send him to Pliny, and so on.  General reading upon this plan, with no idea of collection in view, would  in time reduce most of us to idiocy.    Let our reading be, above all things, well ordered and systematic. Let us  imitate Ancillon rather than Gibbon. Ancillon never read a book  throughout without reading in his progress many others of an exegetic  nature; so that 'his library table was always covered with a number of  books for the most part open.'[31] An excellent habit, provided that we  can resist the temptation to be side-tracked. The list of books by this  industrious student, however, shows by their curious variety that he at  least was not sufficiently strong-minded to resist wandering, during the  compilation of his historical works, in the byways of literature.    If we read the good solid books at all, let us at least read them with  the aim of acquiring the maximum amount of information they afford. To  read sketchily and diversely is not only a most painful waste of time,  but it abuses our brains. Suppose now that our bookman has decided to  'read up' the French Revolution, a subject to which we all turn at some  period of our lives. He has been led thereto, perhaps, by having lighted  upon a translation of someone's memoirs, the recollections of some  insignificant valet-de-chambre or dissolute cure (for such memoirs  abound), more interesting by reason of its piquancy than its historical  accuracy. He reads of persons and events that he recollects vaguely to  have heard of before, and so he goes on and on.    At the end, he has an ambiguous and temporary knowledge of names and  events. He has become acquainted with certain facts that he may possibly  remember; such as that the name of the French King was Louis and that his  Queen was Marie Antoinette, that they tried to escape and got as far as  Varennes (_wherever that may be_), but were brought back and executed;  that there were various politicians named Mirabeau, Danton, Robespierre,  Desmoulins, and a curious party called the Girondins, et cetera. As to  the causes which led up to the Revolution, the condition of the country  and people, the ministry of Turgot, the characters of the King and Queen,  Necker's policy, the Abbe Sieyes, the Tennis Court, the composition of  the Assembly, and the host of essential facts, his knowledge is precisely  _nil_. The terms Right Centre, Extreme Left, the Jacobins, the White  Terror, Assignats, Hebertists and Dantonists, the Montagnards, the Old  Cordelier, are so much 'Hebrew-Greek' to him. At the end of six months he  will not be at all sure whether it was Louis XIV., XV., or XVI. who was  beheaded.    Surely his reading of these dubious memoirs has been a most mistaken  course and a lamentable waste of time? He has gained nothing that has  benefited him intellectually, and he has loaded his mind with an  indigestible hotch-potch of unclassified information. How then should he  have approached the subject? Obviously he should have begun at the  threshold, or rather at the outer gate. To plunge straight away into  Louis Blanc's twelve volumes or Lamartine's 'History of the Girondins'  would be as great a mistake as the reading of the unprofitable memoirs. A  good beginning is half done. So, having prepared the way by a short study  of the economic condition of France immediately prior to the Revolution,  that he may"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22718"],[0,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1 (#17)"],[1,"symbols, and the outer of the piers were  channelled and conventionally cut; and although the fancy of the  sculptor is marvellously subtle and full of grace, his greatest art was  reserved for the capitals of the inner columns and the inner faces of  the piers, which meditating priests would see and study. The symbolism  authorised by Holy Church, the history of precursors of Our Lord, the  incidents of His life and the more dramatic doings of the Saints, all  these are carved with greatest love of detail and of art; and in them  the least arduous priest could find themes for a whole year of  meditation, the least enthusiastic of travellers, a thousand quaint and  interesting fancies and imaginations. It is not so much the beauty of  the whole effect that is entrancing in these Cloisters, nor that most  subtle influence, the good or evil spirit of a past which lingers round  so many ancient spots, as that mediaeval thought and mediaeval genius that  found expression in these myriad fine examples of the sculptor's art.    [Illustration: \"A NAVE OF GREAT AND SLENDER HEIGHT.\"--ARLES.]    [Illustration: \"THE BEAUTY OF THE WHOLE.\"--ARLES.]    Alexandre Dumas has written of Arles: \"Roman monuments form the soil;  and about them, at their feet, in their shadow, in their crevasses, a  second Gothic city has sprung--one knows not how--by the vegetative  force of the religious civilisation of Saint Louis. Arles is the  Mecca of archaeologists.\" It is also the Mecca of those who love to  study people and customs, for, in spite of the railroad, and the  consequent influx of \"foreign French,\" it has preserved the old  graeco-roman-saracenic type which has made its beautiful women so  justly famous, and, underneath its Provencal gaieties, their classic  origins may easily be traced. One should see the Roman Theatre, the  solitary Aliscamps, by moonlight, the busy market in the early day,  the Cathedral at a Mass, and a fete at any time,--for        \"When the fete-days come, farewell the swath and labour,        And welcome revels underneath the trees,        And orgies in the vaulted hostelries,      Bull-baitings, never-ending dances, and sweet pleasures.\"      [Sidenote: Entrevaux.]    The most celebrated fortified town in France is the Cite of Carcassonne,  yet, even in the days of its practical strength, it was scarcely a type.  It was rather a marvel, a wonder,--the \"fairest Maid of Languedoc,\" \"the  Invincible.\" And now the citadel is almost deserted. The inhabitants are  so few that weeds grow in their streets, and one who walks there in the  still mid-day feels that all this completion of architecture, these  walls, perfect in every stone, may be an enchanted vision, a mirage; he  more than half believes that the cool of the sunset will dispel the  illusion, and he will find himself on a pleasant little hill of  Languedoc, looking down upon the commonplace \"Lower City\" of  Carcassonne.    At Entrevaux there is no suggestion of illusion. This is not a  show-place that once was real; it is one of a hundred little  agglomerations of the French Middle Ages. They had no great name to  uphold; no riches to expend in impregnable walls and towers. They clung  fearfully together for self-preservation, built ramparts that were as  strong as might be, and dared not laugh at the \"fortunes of war.\" Except  that there is safety outside the walls, and a tiny post and telegraph  office within, they are now as they were in those dangerous days. The  fortress of Carcassonne is dead; but in the back country of Provence,  Entrevaux is living, and scarcely a jot or tittle of its Mediaevalism is  lost. Among high rocks that close around it on every side, where,  according to the season, the Chalvagne trickles or plunges into the  river Var, and dominated by a fort that perches on a sharp peak, is the  strangest of old Provencal towns.    [Illustration: THE GOTHIC WALK, CLOISTER.--ARLES.]    The founding of the tiny episcopal city was after this wise. Toward the  close of the XIV century, in a time of plagues, Jewish persecutions, the  growth of heresies, and the uncurbed ravages of free-booters, the city  of Glandeves, seat of an ancient Bishopric, was destroyed. The living  remnant abandoned its desolate ruins. Searching for a stronger, safer  home, they chose a site on the left bank of the Var, and commenced the  building of Entrevaux. The Bishop accompanied his flock, and although he  retained the old title of Glandeves, in memory of the antiquity of the  See and its lost city, the Cathedral-church was established at  Entrevaux.    The first edifice, Saint-Martin's, built shortly after the founding of  the town, has long been destroyed; and the second, begun in 1610, to the  honour of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, held episcopal rank  until the See was disestablished by the great Concordat. Although this  Cathedral was built in the XVII century, a date perilously near that of  decadence in French ecclesiastical architecture, it was situated in so  obscure a corner of Provence that its plan was unaffected by innovating  ideas; it is of the old native type, a building of stout walls and heavy  buttresses, a single tower, square and straight, and a tunnel-vaulted  room, the place of congregation. This interior, with no beautiful  details that may not be found in other churches, has as many of the  defects of the Italian school as the treasury could afford,--marble  columns, frescoes, gilding, and other rococo decorations which show that  the people of Entrevaux had no higher and no better tastes than those of  Nice; and that the old, simple purity of the church's form was rather a  matter of ignorance or necessity than of choice. The attraction of the  episcopal church pales before the quaint delight of the episcopal city,  and it is as part of the general civic defence that it shares in the  interest of Entrevaux.    [Illustration: \"THIS INTERIOR.\"--ENTREVAUX.]    [Illustration: THE ROMANESQUE WALK, CLOISTER.--ARLES.]    [Illustration: \"ONE OF THREE SMALL DRAWBRIDGES.\"--ENTREVAUX.]    [Illustration: \"THE PORTCULLIS.\"--ENTREVAUX.]    Leaving the train at the nearest railroad station, the traveller  followed the winding Var, and he had scarcely walked four miles when he  saw, across the river, the sharp peak with its fort, and the long lines  of walls that zigzag down the hillside till they reach the crowded roofs  that are clustered closely, in charming irregularity, near the bank.  Along the water's edge, the only part of the town that is not protected  by rocks and hills, there is another line of stout walls and two heavy,  jutting bastions. From a mediaeval point of view Entrevaux looks strong  indeed. The only means of entrance, now as in those olden days, is by  one of three small drawbridges, and so narrow is every street of the  town that no wagon is allowed to cross, for if it made the passage of  the bridge it would be caught hard and fast between the houses. As the  traveller put foot on the drawbridge he felt as though he were a petty  trader or wandering minstrel, or some other figure of the Middle Ages,  entering for a few hours' traffic or a noon-day's rest, and when he  paused under the low arch of the portcullis-gate, people stared at him  as they do at a stranger in little far-off towns. Once inside, he turned  into a street, and was immediately obliged to step into a door-way, for  a man leading a horse was approaching, and they needed all its breadth.  Houses, several stories high, bordered these incredibly dark, narrow  ways, and some of the upper windows had the diminutive balconies so dear  to the South. It was a bright, hot day, but the sun seldom peeped into  these streets; and in the shops the light was dull at mid-day. As he  thought of the men and women of Mediaevalism, who did not dare to wander  in the fields beyond the town, because their safety lay within its  ramparts, suddenly, the little public squares of walled towns appeared  in all the real significance of their light and breadth and sunshine.  Space is precious in Entrevaux, and open places are few. There is one  where the hotels and cafes are found, another across the drawbridge  behind the Cathedral-tower, and a tiny one before the church itself.  This is the most curious of them all; for, far from being a \"Place de la  Cathedrale,\" it is a true \"Place d'Armes.\" Near the portals, on whose  wooden doors the mitre and insignia of papal favour are carved, a few  steps lead to a narrow ledge where archers could stand and shoot from  the loop-holes in the walls. As the traveller sat on this ledge and  wondered what scenes had been enacted here, how many deadly shots had  sped from out the holes, what crowds of excited townsfolk had gathered  in the church, what grave words of exhortation and of blessing had been  spoken from the altar or the threshold by anxious prelate, robed and  mitred for the Mass of Supplication to a God of Battles, an humble  funeral appeared,--a priest, a peasant bearing a black wooden Cross with  the name of the deceased painted on it, a rope-bound coffin carried by  hot and sorrowing women, and a little procession of friends. The pomps  and vanities of the past disappeared as a mist from the traveller's  mind, and he saw Entrevaux as it really is, without the comforts of this  world's goods, without the greatness of a Bishopric, a small Provencal  village whose perfection of quaintness--so charming to him who passes  on--means hardship and discomfort to those who have been born and must  live and die there.    [Illustration: \"A FORT THAT PERCHES ON A SHARP PEAK.\"--ENTREVAUX.]    [Illustration: \"A TRUE PLACE D'ARMES.\"--ENTREVAUX.]    And yet so potent is that charm, when the traveller re-crossed the  drawbridge and looked up at the sharp teeth of the portcullis that may  still fall and bite, when he had passed out on the high-road and turned  again and again to watch the fading sunlight on the tangled mass"]]]
