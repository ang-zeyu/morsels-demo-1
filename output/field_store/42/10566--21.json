(#17)"],[1,"ernaculars, public inscriptions and private official documents  continued to be composed in Sanskrit during the last two thousand  years. And though the language of the sacred writings of Buddhists and  _G_ainas was borrowed from the vulgar dialects, the literature of  India never ceased to be written in Pa_n_inean Sanskrit, while the few  exceptions, as, for instance, the use of Prakrit by women and inferior  characters in the plays of Kalidasa and others, are themselves not  without an important historical significance.    Even at the present moment, after a century of English rule and  English teaching, I believe that Sanskrit is more widely understood in  India than Latin was in Europe at the time of Dante.    Whenever I receive a letter from a learned man in India, it is written  in Sanskrit. Whenever there is a controversy on questions of law and  religion, the pamphlets published in India are written in Sanskrit.  There are journals written in Sanskrit which must entirely depend for  their support on readers who prefer that classical language to the  vulgar dialects. There is _The Pandit_, published at Benares,  containing not only editions of ancient texts, but treatises on modern  subjects, reviews of books published in England, and controversial  articles, all in Sanskrit.    Another paper of the same kind is the _Pratna-Kamra-nandini_, \"the  Delight of lovers of old things,\" published likewise at Benares, and  full of valuable materials.    There is also the _Vidyodaya_, \"the Rise of Knowledge,\" a Sanskrit  journal published at Calcutta, which sometimes contains important  articles. There are probably others, which I do not know.    There is a monthly serial published at Bombay, by M. Moreshwar Kunte,  called the _Shad-darshana-Chintanika_, or \"Studies in Indian  Philosophy,\" giving the text of the ancient systems of philosophy,  with commentaries and treatises, written in Sanskrit, though in this  case accompanied by a Marathi and an English translation.    Of the Rig-Veda, the most ancient of Sanskrit books, two editions are  now coming out in monthly numbers, the one published at Bombay, by  what may be called the liberal party, the other at Prayaga (Allahabad)  by Dayananda Sarasvati, the representative of Indian orthodoxy. The  former gives a paraphrase in Sanskrit, and a Marathi and an English  translation; the latter a full explanation in Sanskrit, followed by a  vernacular commentary. These books are published by subscription, and  the list of subscribers among the natives of India is very  considerable.    There are other journals, which are chiefly written in the spoken  dialects, such as Bengali, Marathi, or Hindi; but they contain occasional  articles in Sanskrit, as, for instance, the Hari_sk_andra_k_andrika,  published at Benares, the _Tattvabodhini_, published at Calcutta, and  several more.    It was only the other day that I saw in the _Liberal_, the journal of  Keshub Chunder Sen's party,[92] an account of a meeting between  Brahmavrata Samadhyayi, a Vedic scholar of Nuddea, and Kashinath  Trimbak Telang, a M.A. of the University of Bombay. The one came from  the east, the other from the west, yet both could converse fluently in  Sanskrit.[93]    Still more extraordinary is the number of Sanskrit texts, issuing from  native presses, for which there seems to be a large demand, for if we  write for copies to be sent to England, we often find that, after a  year or two, all the copies have been bought up in India itself. That  would not be the case with Anglo-Saxon texts in England, or with Latin  texts in Italy!    But more than this, we are told that the ancient epic poems of the  Mahabharata and Ramaya_n_a are still recited in the temples for the  benefit of visitors, and that in the villages large crowds assemble  around the Kathaka, the reader of these ancient Sanskrit poems, often  interrupting his recitations with tears and sighs, when the hero of  the poem is sent into banishment, while when he returns to his  kingdom, the houses of the village are adorned with lamps and  garlands. Such a recitation of the whole of the Mahabharata is said to  occupy ninety days, or sometimes half a year.[94] The people at large  require, no doubt, that the Brahman narrator (Kathaka) should  interpret the old poem, but there must be some few people present who  understand, or imagine they understand, the old poetry of Vyasa and  Valmiki.    There are thousands of Brahmans[95] even now, when so little  inducement exists for Vedic studies, who know the whole of the  Rig-Veda by heart and can repeat it; and what applies to the Rig-Veda  applies to many other books.    But even if Sanskrit were more of a dead language than it really is,  all the living languages of India, both Aryan and Dravidian, draw  their very life and soul from Sanskrit.[96] On this point, and on the  great help that even a limited knowledge of Sanskrit would render in  the acquisition of the vernaculars, I, and others better qualified  than I am, have spoken so often, though without any practical effect,  that I need not speak again. Any candidate who knows but the elements  of Sanskrit grammar will well understand what I mean, whether his  special vernacular may be Bengali, Hindustani, or even Tamil. To a  classical scholar I can only say that between a civil servant who  knows Sanskrit and Hindustani, and another who knows Hindustani only,  there is about the same difference in their power of forming an  intelligent appreciation of India and its inhabitants, as there is  between a traveller who visits Italy with a knowledge of Latin, and a  party personally conducted to Rome by Messrs. Cook & Co.    Let us examine, however, the objection that Sanskrit literature is a  dead or an artificial literature, a little more carefully, in order to  see whether there is not some kind of truth in it. Some people hold  that the literary works which we possess in Sanskrit never had any  real life at all, that they were altogether scholastic productions,  and that therefore they can teach us nothing of what we really care  for, namely, the historical growth of the Hindu mind. Others maintain  that at the present moment, at all events, and after a century of  English rule, Sanskrit literature has ceased to be a motive power in  India, and that it can teach us nothing of what is passing now through  the Hindu mind and influencing it for good or for evil.    Let us look at the facts. Sanskrit literature is a wide and a vague  term. If the Vedas, such as we now have them, were composed about 1500  B.C., and if it is a fact that considerable works continue to be  written in Sanskrit even now, we have before us a stream of literary  activity extending over three thousand four hundred years. With the  exception of China there is nothing like this in the whole world.    It is difficult to give an idea of the enormous extent and variety of  that literature. We are only gradually becoming acquainted with the  untold treasures which still exist in manuscripts, and with the titles  of that still larger number of works which must have existed formerly,  some of them being still quoted by writers of the last three or four  centuries.[97]    The Indian Government has of late years ordered a kind of  bibliographical survey of India to be made, and has sent some learned  Sanskrit scholars, both European and native, to places where  collections of Sanskrit MSS. are known to exist, in order to examine  and catalogue them. Some of these catalogues have been published, and  we learn from them that the number of separate works in Sanskrit, of  which mss. are still in existence, amounts to about 10,000.[98] This  is more, I believe, than the whole classical literature of Greece and  Italy put together. Much of it, no doubt, will be called mere rubbish;  but then you know that even in our days the writings of a very eminent  philosopher have been called \"mere rubbish.\" What I wish you to see is  this, that there runs through the whole history of India, through its  three or four thousand years, a high road, or, it is perhaps more  accurate to say, a high mountain-path of literature. It may be remote  from the turmoil of the plain, hardly visible perhaps to the millions  of human beings in their daily struggle of life. It may have been  trodden by a few solitary wanderers only. But to the historian of the  human race, to the student of the development of the human mind, those  few solitary wanderers are after all the true representatives of India  from age to age. Do not let us be deceived. The true history of the  world must always be the history of the few; and as we measure the  Himalaya by the height of Mount Everest, we must take the true measure  of India from the poets of the Veda, the sages of the Upanishads, the  founders of the Vedanta and Sankhya philosophies, and the authors of  the oldest law-books, and not from the millions who are born and die  in their villages, and who have never for one moment been roused out  of their drowsy dream of life.    To large multitudes in India, no doubt, Sanskrit literature was not  merely a dead literature, it was simply non-existent; but the same  might be said of almost every literature, and more particularly of the  literatures of the ancient world.    Still, even beyond this, I am quite prepared to acknowledge to a  certain extent the truth of the statement, that a great portion of  Sanskrit literature has never been living and national, in the same  sense in which the Greek and Roman literatures reflected at times the  life of a whole nation; and it is quite true besides, that the  Sanskrit books which are best known to the public at large, belong to  what might correctly be called the Renaissance period of Indian  literature, when those who wrote Sanskrit had themselves to learn the  language, as we learn Latin, and were conscious that they were writing  for a learned and cultivated public only, and not for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#17)"],[1,"ydrogen. The volume occupied  by the water formed by the union of the two gases is so small that it  may be disregarded in the calculation. Since oxygen and hydrogen combine  in the ratio 1: 2 by volume, it is evident that the contraction in  volume due to the combination is equal to the volume occupied by the  oxygen in the air contained in the tube, plus twice this volume of  hydrogen. In other words, one third of the total contraction is equal to  the volume occupied by the oxygen in the inclosed air. The following  example will make this clear:    Volume of air in tube                                        50.0 cc.  Volume after introducing hydrogen                            80.0  Volume after combination of oxygen and hydrogen              48.5  Contraction in volume due to combination (80 cc.-48.5 cc.)   31.5  Volume of oxygen in 50 cc. of air (1/3 of 31.5)              10.5    All these methods agree in showing that 100 volumes of dry air contain  approximately 21 volumes of oxygen.    2. _Determination of nitrogen._ If the gas left after the removal of  oxygen from a portion of air is passed over heated magnesium, the  nitrogen is withdrawn, argon and the other rare elements being left. It  may thus be shown that of the 79 volumes of gas left after the removal  of the oxygen from 100 volumes of air, approximately 78 are nitrogen and  0.93 argon. The other elements are present in such small quantities that  they may be neglected.    3. _Determination of carbon dioxide._ The percentage of carbon dioxide  in any given volume of air may be determined by passing the air over  calcium hydroxide or some other compound which will combine with the  carbon dioxide. The increase in the weight of the hydroxide equals the  weight of the carbon dioxide absorbed. The amount present in the open  normal air is from 3 to 4 parts by volume in 10,000 volumes of air, or  about 0.04%.    4. _Determination of water vapor._ The water vapor present in a given  volume of air may be determined by passing the air over calcium chloride  (or some other compound which has a strong affinity for water), and  noting the increase in the weight of the chloride. The amount present  varies not only with the locality, but there is a wide variation from  day to day in the same locality because of the winds and changes in  temperature.    ~Processes affecting the composition of the air.~ The most important of  these processes are the following.    1. _Respiration._ In the process of respiration some of the oxygen in  the inhaled air is absorbed by the blood and carried to all parts of the  body, where it combines with the carbon of the worn-out tissues. The  products of oxidation are carried back to the lungs and exhaled in the  form of carbon dioxide. The amount exhaled by an adult averages about 20  l. per hour. Hence in a poorly ventilated room occupied by a number of  people the amount of carbon dioxide rapidly increases. While this gas is  not poisonous unless present in large amounts, nevertheless air  containing more than 15 parts in 10,000 is not fit for respiration.    2. _Combustion._ All of the ordinary forms of fuel contain large  percentages of carbon. On burning, this carbon combines with oxygen in  the air, forming carbon dioxide. Combustion and respiration, therefore,  tend to diminish the amount of oxygen in the air and to increase the  amount of carbon dioxide.    3. _Action of plants._ Plants have the power, when in the sunlight, of  absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, retaining the carbon and  returning at least a portion of the oxygen to the air. It will be  observed that these changes are just the opposite of those brought about  by the processes of respiration and combustion.         ~Poisonous effect of exhaled air.~ The differences in the       percentages of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and moisture present in       inhaled air and exhaled air are shown in the following       analyses.                           INHALED AIR     EXHALED AIR         Oxygen            21.00%          16.00%         Carbon dioxide     0.04            4.38         Moisture         variable        saturated         The foul odor of respired air is due to the presence of a       certain amount of organic matter. It is possible that this       organic matter rather than the carbon dioxide is responsible       for the injurious effects which follow the respiration of       impure air. The extent of such organic impurities present may       be judged, however, by the amount of carbon dioxide present,       since the two are exhaled together.         ~The cycle of carbon in nature.~ Under the influence of sunlight,       the carbon dioxide absorbed from the air by plants reacts with       water and small amounts of other substances absorbed from the       soil to form complex compounds of carbon which constitute the       essential part of the plant tissue. This reaction is attended       by the evolution of oxygen, which is restored to the air. The       compounds resulting from these changes are much richer in their       energy content than are the substances from which they are       formed; hence a certain amount of energy must have been       absorbed in their formation. The source of this energy is the       sun's rays.         If the plant is burned, the changes which took place in the       formation of the compounds present are largely reversed. The       carbon and hydrogen present combine with oxygen taken from the       air to form carbon dioxide and water, while the energy absorbed       from the sun's rays is liberated in the form of energy of heat.       If, on the other hand, the plant is used as food, the compounds       present are used in building up the tissues of the body. When       this tissue breaks down, the changes which it undergoes are       very similar to those which take place when the plant is       burned. The carbon and hydrogen combine with the inhaled oxygen       to form carbon dioxide and water, which are exhaled. The energy       possessed by the complex substances is liberated partly in the       form of energy of heat, which maintains the heat of the body,       and partly in the various forms of muscular energy. The carbon       originally absorbed from the air by the plant in the form of       carbon dioxide is thus restored to the air and is ready to       repeat the cycle of changes.    ~The composition of the air is constant.~ Notwithstanding the changes  constantly taking place which tend to alter the composition of the air,  the results of a great many analyses of air collected in the open fields  show that the percentages of oxygen and nitrogen as well as of carbon  dioxide are very nearly constant. Indeed, so constant are the  percentages of oxygen and nitrogen that the question has arisen, whether  these two elements are not combined in the air, forming a definite  chemical compound. That the two are not combined but are simply mixed  together can be shown in a number of ways, among which are the  following.    1. When air dissolves in water it has been found that the ratio of  oxygen to nitrogen in the dissolved air is no longer 21: 78, but more  nearly 35: 65. If it were a chemical compound, the ratio of oxygen to  nitrogen would not be changed by solution in water.    2. A chemical compound in the form of a liquid has a definite boiling  point. Water, for example, boils at 100 deg.. Moreover the steam which is  thus formed has the same composition as the water. The boiling point of  liquid air, on the other hand, gradually rises as the liquid boils, the  nitrogen escaping first followed by the oxygen. If the two were  combined, they would pass off together in the ratio in which they are  found in the air.    ~Why the air has a constant composition.~ If air is a mixture and changes  are constantly taking place which tend to modify its composition, how,  then, do we account for the constancy of composition which the analyses  reveal? This is explained by several facts. (1) The changes which are  caused by the processes of combustion and respiration, on the one hand,  and the action of plants, on the other, tend to equalize each other. (2)  The winds keep the air in constant motion and so prevent local changes.  (3) The volume of the air is so vast and the changes which occur are so  small compared with the total amount of air that they cannot be readily  detected. (4) Finally it must be noted that only air collected in the  open fields shows this constancy in composition. The air in a poorly  ventilated room occupied by a number of people rapidly changes in  composition.    ~The properties of the air.~ Inasmuch as air is composed principally of a  mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, which elements have already been  discussed, its properties may be inferred largely from those of the two  gases. One liter weighs 1.2923 g. It is thus 14.38 times as heavy as  hydrogen. At the sea level it exerts an average pressure sufficient to  sustain a column of mercury 760 mm. in height. This is taken as the  standard pressure in determining the volumes of gases as well as the  boiling points of liquids. Water may be made to boil at any temperature  between 0 deg. and considerably above 100 deg. by simply varying the pressure.  It is only when the pressure upon it is equal to the normal pressure of  the atmosphere at the sea level, as indicated by a barometric reading of  760 mm., that it boils at 100 deg..    ~Preparation of liquid air.~ Attention has been called to the fact that  both oxygen and nitrogen can be obtained in the liquid state by strongly  cooling the gases and applying great pressure to them. Since air is  largely a mixture of these two gases, it can be liquefied by the same  methods.         The methods for liquefying air have been simplified greatly in       that the low temperature required is obtained by allowing a       portion of the compressed air to expand.
