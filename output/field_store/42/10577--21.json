It is taken from the Manchurian  Eared Pheasant of northern China.  Unless the demand for these feathers  is overcome in some way there will undoubtedly come a day in the  not-distant future when the name of this bird must be added to the  lengthening list of species that have been sacrificed to the greed of  the shortsightedness of man.    _Goura._--The fashionable and expensive hat decoration which passes  under the trade name of Goura consists of the slender feathers, usually  four or five inches long with a greatly enlarged tip, that grows out  fanlike along a line down the centre of the head {158} and nape of  certain large Ground Pigeons that inhabit New Guinea and adjacent  islands.  Perhaps the best-known species is the Crowned Pigeon.    There is a special trade name for the feathers of almost every kind of  bird known in the millinery business.  Thus there is Coque for Black  Cock, Cross Aigrettes for the little plumes of the Snowy Egret, and  Eagle Quills from the wings not only of Eagles, but of Bustards,  Pelicans, Albatrosses, Bush Turkeys, and even Turkey Buzzards.  The  feathers of Macaws in great numbers are used in the feather trade, as  well as hundreds of thousands of Hummingbirds, and other  bright-coloured birds of the tropics.    [Illustration: Crowned Pigeon That Furnishes the Goura of the Feather  Trade]    _Women's Love for Feathers._--One of the most coveted and easily  acquired feminine adornments has been feathers.  At first these were  probably taken almost wholly from birds killed for food, but later,  when civilization became more complex and resourceful, millinery  dealers searched the ends of the earth to supply the demands of  discriminating women.  The chief reason why it has been so difficult  {160} to induce educated and cultivated women of this age to give up  the heartless practice of wearing feathers seems to be the fact that  the desire and necessity for adornment developed through the centuries  has become so strong as to be really an inherent part of their natures.  It is doubtful if many people realize how strong and all-powerful this  desire for conforming to fashion in the matter of dress sits enthroned  in the hearts of tens of thousands of good women.    [Illustration: An Egret, bearing \"aigrettes,\" in attendance on her  young]    There was a time when I thought that any woman with human instincts  would give up the wearing of feathers at once upon being told of the  barbaric cruelties involved in their acquisition.  But I have learned  to my amazement that such is not the case.  Not long ago I received one  of the shocks of my life.  Somewhat over two years ago a young woman  came to work in our office.  I supposed she had never heard, except  casually, of the great scourge of the millinery trade in feathers.  Since that time, however, she has been in daily touch with all the  important efforts made in this country and abroad to {161} legislate  the traffic out of existence, to guard from the plume hunters the  colonies of Egrets and other water birds, and to educate public  sentiment to a proper appreciation of the importance of bird  protection.  She has typewritten a four-hundred-page book on birds and  bird protection, has acknowledged the receipt of letters from the  wardens telling of desperate rifle battles that they have had with  poachers, and written letters to the widow of one of our agents shot to  death while guarding a Florida bird rookery.  In the heat of campaigns  she has worked overtime and on holidays.  I have never known a woman  who laboured more conscientiously or was apparently more interested in  the work.  Frequently her eyes would open wide and she would express  resentment when reports reached the office of the atrocities  perpetrated on wild birds by the heartless agents of the feather trade.  Recently she married and left us.  Last week she called at the office,  looking very beautiful and radiant.  After a few moments' conversation  she approached the subject which {162} evidently lay close to her  heart.  Indicating a cluster of paradise aigrettes kept in the office  for exhibition purposes, she looked me straight in the face and in the  most frank and guileless manner asked me to sell them to her for her  new hat!  The rest of the day I was of little service to the world.    What was the good of all the long years of unceasing effort to induce  women to stop wearing bird feathers, if this was a fair example of  results?  Of all the women I knew, there was no one who had been in a  position to learn more of the facts regarding bird slaughter than this  one; yet it seems that it had never entered her mind to make a personal  application of the lesson she had learned.  The education and restraint  of legislative enactments were all meant for other people.    _Ostrich Feathers Are Desirable._--How is this deep-seated desire and  demand for feathers to be met?  Domestic fowls will in part supply it;  but for the finer ornaments we must turn to the Ostrich, the only bird  in the world which has been domesticated {163} exclusively for its  feather product.  These birds were formerly found wild in Arabia,  southwestern Persia, and practically the whole of Africa.  In  diminishing numbers they are still to be met with in these regions,  especially in the unsettled parts of Africa north of the Orange River.  From early times the plumes of these avian giants have been in demand  for head decorations, and for centuries the people of Asia and Africa  killed the birds for this purpose.  They were captured chiefly by means  of pitfalls, for a long-legged bird which in full flight can cover  twenty-five feet at a stride is not easily overtaken, even with the  Arabs' finest steeds.    So far as there is any record, young Ostriches were first captured and  enclosed with a view of rearing them for profit in the year 1857.  This  occurred in South Africa.  During the years which have since elapsed,  the raising of Ostriches and the exportation of their plumes has become  one of the chief business enterprises of South Africa.  Very naturally  people in other parts of the world wished to engage in a {164} similar  enterprise when they saw with what success the undertaking was crowned  in the home country of the Ostrich.  A few hundred fine breeding birds  and a considerable number of eggs were purchased by adventurous spirits  and exported, with the result that Ostrich farms soon sprang up in  widely separated localities over the earth.  The lawmakers of Cape  Colony looked askance at these competitors and soon prohibited Ostrich  exportation.  Before these drastic measures were taken, however, a  sufficient number of birds had been removed to other countries to  assure the future growth of the industry in various regions of the  world.  It was in 1882 that these birds were first brought to the  United States for breeding purposes.  To-day there are Ostrich farms at  Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, California; Hot Springs,  Arkansas; Jacksonville, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona, and elsewhere.    There is money to be made in the Ostrich business, for the wing and  tail plumes of this bird are as popular to-day for human adornment as  they were in the {165} days of Sheerkohf, the gorgeous lion of the  mountain.  Even low-grade feathers command a good price for use in the  manufacture of boas, feather bands, trimming for doll's hats, and other  secondary purposes.  When the time comes for plucking the feathers, the  Ostriches are driven one at a time into a V-shaped corral just large  enough to admit the bird's body and the workman.  Here a long, slender  hood is slipped over his head and the wildest bird instantly becomes  docile.  Evidently he regards himself as effectively hidden and secure  from all the terrors of earth.  There is no pain whatever attached to  the taking of Ostrich feathers, for they are merely clipped from the  bird by means of scissors.  A month or two later when the stubs of the  quills have become dry they are readily picked from the wings without  injury to the new feathers.    The Ostrich industry is good and it is worthy of encouragement.  No  woman need fear that she is aiding in any way the destruction of birds  by wearing Ostrich plumes.  There are many more of the birds {166} in  the world to-day than there were when their domestication first began,  and probably no wild African or Asiatic Ostriches are now shot or  trapped for their plumes.  The product seen in our stores all comes  from strong, happy birds hatched and reared in captivity.  Use of their  feathers does not entail the sacrifice of life, nor does it cause the  slightest suffering to the Ostrich; taking plumes from an Ostrich being  no more painful to the bird than shearing is to a sheep and does not  cause it half the alarm a sheep often exhibits at shearing time.    The call for feather finery rings so loudly in the hearts of women that  it will probably never cease to be heard, and it is the Ostrich--the  big, ungainly yet graceful Ostrich--which must supply the demand for  high-grade feathers of the future.          {167}    CHAPTER IX    BIRD-PROTECTIVE LAWS AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT--HOW LAWS ARE MADE    Laws for the protection of wild birds and animals have been enacted in  greater numbers in the United States than in any other country in the  world.  In a Government Bulletin on American Game Protection, Dr. T. S.  Palmer states that the earliest game laws were probably the hunting  privileges granted in 1629 by the West India Company to persons  planting colonies in the New Netherlands, and the provisions granting  the right of hunting in the Massachusetts Bay Colonial Ordinance of  1647.  As soon as the United States Government was formed, in 1776, the  various States began to make laws on the subject, and these have  increased"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21012"],[0,"The Loyalists of America and Their Times, Vol. 1 of 2. (#17)"],[1,"edition of his  History, that \"the Browns were banished _because they were Churchmen.  Thus was Episcopacy professed in Massachusetts, and thus was it exiled.  The blessings of the promised land were to be kept for Puritan  dissenters_.\"[37] This statement of Mr. Bancroft is confirmed and the  conduct of Endicot more specifically stated by earlier New England  historians. In the \"Ecclesiastical History of Massachusetts,\" reprinted  by the Massachusetts Historical Society, the whole affair is minutely  related. The following passages are sufficient for my purpose:    \"An opposition of some consequence arose from several persons of  influence, who had been active in promoting the settlement of the place.  At the head of this were Mr. Samuel Brown and Mr. John Brown, the one a  lawyer and the other a merchant, who were attached to the form and usage  of the Church of England. The ministers [Higginson and Skelton],  assisted by Mr. Endicot, endeavoured to bring them over to the practice  of the Puritans, but without success.\" \"These gentlemen, with others,  were conscientious Churchmen, and desired to use the Liturgy, and for  this purpose met in their own houses. The magistrates, or rather Mr.  Endicot, sent to demand a reason for their separation. They answered,  that as they were of the Church established by law in their native  country, it was highly proper they should worship God as the Government  required, from whom they had received their Charter. Surely they might  be allowed that _liberty of conscience_ which all conceived to be  reasonable when they were on the other side of the water. But these  arguments were called _seditious_ and _mutinous_.\"    \"Mr. Bentley imputes the errors of the ministers to the temper of  Endicot, who was determined to execute his own plan of Church  government. Inexperienced in the passions of men, and unaccustomed to  consult even his friends, he was resolved to suffer no opposition; and  as the Salem Church had disdained the authority of the Church of  England, his feelings were hurt and his temper raised against those who  preferred a Liturgy, and whose object might be, as he conceived, to  cause a schism in the community.\"[38]    The Mr. Bentley referred to above was the historian of the town of  Salem, in a book entitled \"Description and History of Salem, by the Rev.  William Bentley,\" and reprinted in the \"Collection of the Massachusetts  Historical Society,\" Vol. VI., pp. 212-277. Referring to Endicot's  conduct to the Browns, Mr. Bentley says:    \"Endicot had been the cause of all the rash proceedings against the  Browns. He was determined to execute his own plan of Church government.  Inexperienced in the passions of men, and unaccustomed to consult even  his friends, he was resolved to admit of no opposition. They _who could  not be terrified into silence_ were _not commanded to withdraw, but they  were seized and banished as criminals_. The fear of injury to the colony  induced its friends in England to give private satisfaction, and then to  write a reproof to him who had been the cause of the outrages; and  Endicot never recovered his reputation in England.\" (p. 245.)    It is thus clear beyond reasonable doubt that the sole offence of the  Browns, and those who remained with them, was that they adhered to the  worship which they had always practised, and which was professed by all  parties when they left England, and because they refused to follow Mr.  Endicot in the new Church polity and worship which he adopted from the  Congregational Plymouth physician, after his arrival at Salem, and which  he was determined to establish as the only worship in the new  Plantation. It was Endicot, therefore, that commenced the change, the  innovation, the schism, and the power given him as Manager of the  trading business of the Company he exercised for the purpose of  establishing a Church revolution, and banishing the men who adhered to  the old ways of worship professed by the Company when applying for the  Royal Charter, and still professed by them in England. It is not  pretended by any party that the Browns were not interested in the  success of the Company as originally established, and as professed when  they left England; it is not insinuated that they opposed in any way or  differed from Endicot in regard to his management of the general affairs  of the Company; on the contrary, it is manifest by the statement of all  parties that the sole ground and question of dispute between Endicot and  the Browns was the refusal of the latter to abandon the Episcopal and  adopt the Congregational form of worship set up by Endicot and thirty  others, by joining of hands and subscribing to a covenant and confession  of faith around the well-pump of Naumkeag, then christened Salem.    The whole dispute, then, narrowed to this one question, let us inquire  in what manner the Browns and their friends declined acting with Endicot  in establishing a new form of worship instead of that of the Church of  England?    It does not appear that Endicot even consulted his local Council, much  less the Directors of the Company in England, as to his setting up a new  Church and new form of worship in the new Plantation at Salem. Having  with the new accession of emigrants received the appointment of  Governor, he appears to have regarded himself as an independent ruler.  Suddenly raised from being a manager and captain to being a Governor, he  assumed more despotic power than did King Charles in England, and among  the new emigrants placed under his control, and whom he seems to have  regarded as his subjects--himself their absolute sovereign, in both  Church and State. In his conferences with Fuller, the Congregational  doctor from New Plymouth, he found the Congregational worship to answer  to his aspirations as in it he could on the one hand gratify his hatred  of King and Church, and on the other hand become the founder of the new  Church in a new Plantation. He paused not to consider whether the  manager of a trading Company of adventurers had any authority to abolish  the worship professed by the Company under whose authority he was  acting; how far fidelity required him to give effect to the worship of  his employers in carrying out their instructions in regard to the  religious instruction of their servants and the natives; but he  forthwith resolved to adopt a new confession of faith and to set up a  new form of worship. On the arrival of the first three chaplains of the  Company, in June of 1629, several months after his own arrival, Endicot  seems to have imparted his views to them, and two of them, Higginson and  Skelton, fell in with his scheme; but Mr. Bright adhered to his Church.  It was not unnatural for Messrs. Higginson and Skelton to prefer  becoming the fathers and founders of a new Church than to remain  subordinate ministers of an old Church. The Company, in its written  agreement with them, or rather in its instructions accompanying them to  Endicot, allowed them discretion in their new mission field as to their  mode of teaching and worship; but certainly no authority to ignore it,  much less authority to adopt a new confession of faith and a new form of  worship.    Within three months after the arrival of these chaplains of the Company  at Salem, they and Endicot matured the plan of setting up a new Church,  and seemed to have persuaded thirty-one of the two hundred emigrants to  join with them--a minority of less than one-sixth of the little  community; but in that minority was the absolute Governor, and against  whose will a majority was nothing, even in religious matters, or in  liberty of conscience. Government by majorities and liberty of  conscience are attributes of freedom.    Let it be observed here, once for all, that Endicot and his friends are  not, in my opinion, censurable for changing their professed religious  opinions and worship and adopting others, if they thought it right to do  so. If, on their arrival at Massachusetts Bay, they thought and felt  themselves in duty bound to renounce their old and set up a new form of  worship and Church discipline, it was doubtless their right to do so;  but in doing so it was unquestionably their duty not to violate their  previous engagements and the rights of others. They were not the  original owners and occupants of the country, and were not absolutely  free to choose their own form of government and worship; they were  British subjects, and were commencing the settlement of a territory  granted them by their Sovereign; they were sent there by a Company  existing and acting under Royal Charter; Endicot was the chief agent of  that Company, and acting under their instructions. As such, duty  required him to consult his employers before taking the all-important  step of setting aside the worship they professed and establishing a new  one, much less to proscribe and banish those who had adventured as  settlers upon the old professed worship, and declined adopting the new.  And was it not a violation of good faith, as well as liberty of  conscience, to deny to the Browns and their friends the very worship on  the profession of which by all parties they had embarked as settlers in  New England? To come to New England as Churchmen, and then abolish the  worship of the Church and set up a new form of worship, without even  consulting his employers, was what was done by Endicot; and to come as  Churchmen to settle in New England, and then to be banished from it for  being Churchmen, was what was done to the Browns by Endicot.    This act of despotism and persecution--apart from its relations to the  King, and the Company chartered by him--is the more reprehensible from  the manner of its execution and the circumstances connected with it.    It appears from the foregoing statements and authorities, that the  Browns were not only gentlemen of the highest respectability, Puritan  Churchmen, and friends of the"]]]
