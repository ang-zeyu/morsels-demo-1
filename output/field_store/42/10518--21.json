This course had been systematically carried on  some time before it was fully understood.\"    Every animal has a definite language which is quite sufficient to  express the desires and emotions of its nature, and to make them  intelligible, not only to its own species, but also to other animals and  sometimes to human beings. Those which do not actually speak by means of  a voice, make signs or mimic understood things so as to be perfectly  intelligible. If animals had no language, they could not instruct their  young. The young of animals in a civilised country are far wiser than  the old ones in wild, uninhabited countries. This can be explained only  by the knowledge which the young receive from their parents.    It is not uncommon for animals belonging to widely different species to  speak the same language, and thus become great friends. A friend in  Texas once owned a cow whose sole companion was a small black goat. One  day the young goat followed the cow home from her grazing place, and  from that time on they were constant companions, even occupying the same  stall in winter, sharing the same food, and always sleeping near each  other.    If one shoots a monkey in South Africa, and wounds it, allowing it to  escape, there usually come droves of its kinspeople, screaming and  chattering the most diabolical language, seeking to revenge the wrong  done their tribe. Nothing demonstrates plainer that they have a common  language; otherwise, how could they understand that one of their number  had been wounded? It is because of the communication of ideas by a  common language among animals that hunters so fear to allow a wounded  animal to escape at the beginning of their hunting season in certain  localities. A wounded bear who escapes, for example, will spoil the  entire season for hunters by spreading the alarm among his people.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    ROOSEVELT'S COLOBUS. THESE HORSE-TAILED MONKEYS CHATTER TOGETHER IN A  LANGUAGE EXCLUSIVELY THEIR OWN, YET THEY SEEM TO HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN  MAKING THEMSELVES UNDERSTOOD BY OTHER MONKEY-TRIBES.]    [Illustration: A TAMED DEER OF TEXAS, WHOSE CONSTANT COMPANION AND  PLAYMATE WAS A RABBIT DOG. BETWEEN THE TWO THERE DEVELOPED, NECESSARILY,  A COMMON LANGUAGE.]    Near our country home in Texas my sister found a very young red deer one  morning just outside the garden, and bringing it into the yard, soon had  a wonderful pet in this dainty spotted child of the woods. We knew that  its mother was not far away, and so we placed salt and food just where  the baby was found, to attract the mother's attention. In a few days,  we saw the mother, and shortly afterwards five grown deer were seen  eating the food we had placed for the mother. Evidently the news had  been carried through the pine forests that it was safe for deer to come  near our home. My sister's pet grew rapidly, and became a great friend  of our yard dog. They often played by running races together, the deer  would leap over the fence and the dog would chase him with great  delight. Surely, they must have had a spoken common language!    No one claims that in the language of animals there are principles of  construction such as we find in the human languages. The term Barbarian  means those whose language is only a \"bar-bar,\" and this is really all  that the sound of an unknown tongue implied to the cultured Athenians.  The neighing of horses, the howling of dogs and wolves, the mewing of  cats, the bleating of sheep, the lowing of cows, the chattering of  monkeys and baboons is nothing more nor less than their language. And it  is quite as intelligible to us as is the chattering of the Hottentots of  Africa. Because we do not speak the languages of our animal friends does  not take away from the genuineness of the languages; we might as well  claim that because our horse does not comprehend what we are saying,  that we are not speaking a language!    Animals and men, under normal conditions, have been friends and  companions since the beginning of time; and in order that they may  convey ideas to each other, it is necessary for them to have some sort  of means of communication.    As a matter of fact, animal language is quite often intelligible to man.  Their language might be likened to that of a young child that cannot  pronounce distinctly the words we commonly use; and yet we get the  meaning from the intonation and gesture.    Any man who has ever owned a horse understands the meanings of his  various actions and vocal expressions. There is the neigh of joy, upon  returning home after a hard day's work, the neigh of distress, when he  has strayed from his companions, the neigh of salutation that passes  between two horses when they meet, and the neigh of terror when enemies  are near. There is also the neigh of affection that is often given to  his master when they first meet in the morning. Thus, spoken words are  not necessary to express elemental feelings.    Elephants readily understand most of the words uttered by their masters.  Menault tells of an elephant that was employed to pile up heavy logs.  The manager, suspecting the keeper of stealing the grain set aside for  the elephant, accused him of theft, which he denied most vehemently in  the presence of the elephant. The result was remarkable. The animal  suddenly laid hold of a large wrapper which the man wore round his  waist, and tearing it open, let out some quarts of rice which the fellow  had stowed away under the voluminous covering.    Animals have the power to make themselves understood by man, especially  when they are in distress and wish man to help them. And they often  combine to help one another. I was on a sheep ranch in western Texas  once when one of the sheep came bleating up to the camp late in the  afternoon. She uttered the most distressing calls. A friend, whom I was  visiting, assured me that something unusual was wrong. Together we  followed the sheep back to where she had been feeding in the pasture,  she going forward in short spurts and continually looking back to see if  we were coming. She finally led us to an old well, and we heard the  plaintive voice of her young lamb that had fallen in. As the well had no  water in it, and was only about six feet deep, we secured a ladder and  in a few minutes the lamb was restored to its mother. She seemed  delighted at the successful outcome of the accident. She had come and  told us her troubles and got aid.    Cats are gifted linguists. By mewing they can just as plainly express a  desire to have a door opened or closed as if they requested it in so  many words. A friend has furnished me with an interesting account of her  cat's ability to make herself understood. It seems that the cat, with  her three small kittens, at one time slept in a box prepared for her in  the kitchen. But one night when it was particularly cold, some one left  the kitchen window open, and late in the night the cat went to her  mistress's bed and mewed continuously until her mistress arose and went  to the kitchen and closed the window. The cat was perfectly satisfied,  as she had made her great need understood.    The ability that animals have to make their own language understood by  man is not the only linguistic power they possess; as already mentioned,  they are also capable of understanding something of human speech. There  is no doubt that all domesticated animals understand the human language;  the horse, dog, ox, and sheep comprehend a large part of what is said to  them, though of course they may not understand the precise words used.    I once owned a rabbit dog, \"Nimrod,\" and if he never understood another  word of the English language, there is no doubt that he knew what the  word \"rabbit\" meant. No matter in what manner or way I used the word,  Nimrod was ready for a hunt, and yelped with glee at the thought of the  chase that he was to have. I tested him over and over again by saying  \"rabbit hunt\" gently; it thrilled him with delight, and while he was not  very well educated in other things, he always lived up to his name.    The Rev. J. G. Wood speaks of the great individuality of character which  he has observed in dogs, and that they unquestionably understand the  human language. \"There was in my pet greyhound 'Brenda,' there was in my  dear lurcher 'Smoker,' and there is now in my dear lurcher 'Bar,' and in  my three setters 'Chance,' 'Quail,' and 'Quince,' a refinement of  feeling and sagacity infinitely beyond that existing in multitudes of  the human race, whether inhabiting the deserts or the realms of  civilisation.    \"I cannot better define it than by saying that, if I give these dogs a  hastily angered word in my room, though they have never been beaten,  they will, with an expression of the most dejected sorrow, go into a  corner behind some chair, sofa, or table, and lie there. Perhaps I may  have been guilty of a hasty rebuke to them for jogging my table or elbow  while I was writing, and then continued to write on. Some time after,  not having seen my companions lying on the rug before the fire, I have  remembered the circumstance, and, in a tone of voice to which they are  used, I have said, 'There, you are forgiven.' In an instant the  greyhound Brenda would fly into my lap, and cover me with kisses, her  heart tumultuously beating. After she grew old, her joy at my return  home after a long absence has at times nearly killed her; and when I was  away, the bed she loved best was one of my old shooting-jackets, but  never when I was at home.\"    The impassable gulf which the writers of old created between mankind and  the animal kingdom was based mainly upon the belief that animals had no  language, but this has been proved a mistake and no longer exists.

I would give a world, were it mine, to lay this heavy burden of mine  down somewhere, and be as light in disgrace as you are.\"    Ferrers sighed deeply, and Louis said softly, \"'Come unto Him all ye  that are heavy laden, and He will give you rest. His yoke is easy and  His burden is light.'\"    Here they parted. The last whispers of the Saviour's gracious invitation,  those \"comfortable words,\" lingered in Ferrers' ears as he entered the  house, and returned at night; but he did not throw himself and his burden  at the Saviour's feet. And what hindered him? It was pride, pride--though  forced to feel himself a sinner, pride still retained its hold, more  feebly than before, but still as a giant.          CHAPTER IX.      The holidays were fast approaching. Ten days of the three weeks'  examination had passed, and every energy was exerted, and every  feeling of emulation called out, among those who had any hope of  obtaining the honors held out to the successful candidates. It was  surprising to see what could be, and what was, done. Even idle boys  who had let their fair amount of talent lie dormant during the half  year, now came forth, and, straining every nerve, were seen late and  early at work which should have been gradually mastered during the  last five months; denying themselves both recreation and sleep, with  an energy, which, had it been earlier exerted in only half the degree,  would have been highly laudable. Some of the latter, who possessed  great talent, were successful, but generally the prizes fell to the  lot of those who had throughout been uniformly steady, and who had  gained an amount of thorough information which the eager study of a  few weeks could not attain. Now there were beating hearts and anxious  faces, and noisy summing up of the day's successes or losses, when the  daily close of school proclaimed a truce to the emulous combatants.  A few there were who appeared totally indifferent as to the issue of  the contest, and who hailed the term of examination as entailing no set  tasks to be said the ensuing day under certain penalties, and, revelling  in extended play-hours, cared nothing for disgrace, having no character  to lose.    Reginald bid fair to carry off all, or nearly all, the second-class  honors; still, there were in his class several whose determined  efforts and talents gave him considerable work in winning the battle.    Amongst all this spirited warfare, it is not to be supposed  that Louis was tranquil; for, though naturally of an indolent  temperament, there was in him a fund of latent emulation, which  only wanted a stimulus such as the present to rouse him to action.  Louis was a boy of no mean ability, and now, fired with the hope of  distinguishing himself, and gaining a little honor that might efface  the remembrance of past idleness, and give some pleasure to his dear  parents, he applied himself so diligently and unremittingly to his  studies during the last month, as to astonish his masters.    I do not mean to particularize the subjects for examination given by  Dr. Wilkinson to the two upper classes, for this simple reason, that  my classical and mathematical ignorance might cause mistakes more  amusing to the erudite reader than pleasant to the author. It shall  be sufficient to say, that whatever these subjects had been, the day's  examination had gone through in a manner equally creditable to masters  and pupils; and after a few turns in the fresh air when tea was over,  a knot, comprising the greater part of the above-mentioned classes,  assembled round their head man to congratulate him on his undoubted  successes, and to talk over the events of the day elsewhere. Reginald  and Louis could spare little time for talking, and were walking up and  down the playground, questioning and answering each other with the most  untiring diligence, though both of them had been up since four o'clock  that morning. There were a few who had risen still earlier, and who now  lay fast asleep on forms in the school-room, or endeavored to keep their  eyes open by following the example of our hero and his brother.    \"John's fast asleep,\" said Salisbury, laughing; \"he has a capital way  of gaining time--by getting up at half-past three, and falling asleep  at seven.\"    \"How does he stand for the prizes?\" asked Smith.    \"I'm sure I can't tell you; I suppose Mortimer's sure of the first  classics and history--and he ought, for he's coming to us next half.  John's next to him.\"    \"I hear little Mortimer's winning laurels,\" remarked Trevannion.    \"Oh! for _him_,\" said Harris, a second-class boy, \"because he's  been such a dunce before;--I suspect Ferrers helps him.\"    \"Ferrers!\" cried all at once, and there was a laugh--\"Do you hear,  Ferrers?\"    \"Of course I do,\" replied Ferrers.    \"He's not good-natured enough,\" remarked another.    \"He needs no help,\" said Ferrers.    \"You're sure of the mathematical prize, Ferrers; and Hamilton,  of course, gets that for Latin composition.\"    Ferrers did not reply--his thoughts had flown to Louis, from whom they  were now seldom absent; and, though he had been generally successful,  yet the settled gloom and anxiety of his manner led many to suppose  that he entertained fears for the issue of his examination. There were  others who imagined that there was some deeper cause of anxiety preying  on his mind, or that he was suffering from illness and fatigue--and one  or two made mysterious remarks on his intimacy with Louis, and wondered  what all foreboded.    \"I wonder who'll get the medal,\" said one.    \"Hamilton, of course,\" replied Smith.    \"You're out there,\" said Frank Digby. \"My magic has discovered that  either the Lady Louisa or myself will obtain it. I admire your  selfishness, young gentlemen--you assign to yourselves every thing,  and leave us out of the question. If I can't be a genius, I mean to  be a good boy.\"    Many bitter remarks were then made on Louis' late good behavior, and a  few upon his manner towards Ferrers, which, by some, was styled meanness  of the highest degree.    Ferrers could not endure it--he left the circle and walked about the  playground alone, full of remorse, thinking over every plan he had  formed for making amends to Louis for all. He looked up once or twice  with a gasping effort, and, oh! in the wrinkled and contracted forehead  what trouble might be read. \"Oh! that it were a dream,\" he at last  uttered, \"that I could wake and find it a warning.\"    There was a soft, warm hand in his, and Louis' gentle voice replied,  \"Do not grieve now about me, Ferrers, it will soon be over.\"    Ferrers started and drew his hand away.    \"You are not angry with me, are you?\" said Louis; \"I saw you alone,  and I was afraid you wanted comfort--I did not like to come before,  for fear the boys should make remarks, Reginald especially.\"    Ferrers looked at Louis a minute without speaking, and then, pushing  him off, walked quickly to the house, and did not show himself any more  that evening.           *       *       *       *       *    Breakfast had long been finished, and the school was once more  assembled; the second class was waiting impatiently on the raised  end of the school-room for the doctor's entrance, or for a summons  to his presence; and near, at their several desks, busily writing  answers to a number of printed questions, sat the first class. It  was nearly an hour past the time, and impatient eyes were directed  to the clock over the folding-doors, which steadily marked the  flying minutes.    \"Where can the doctor be?\" had been asked many times already,  but no one could answer.    \"We shall have no time--we shall not get done before night,\"  muttered several malcontents. \"What can keep the doctor?\"    At this moment the folding-doors were quickly flung open, and  Dr. Wilkinson entered, and rapidly made his way towards the upper  end of the school-room, but in such a state of unwonted agitation  that the boys were by common consent hushed into silence, and every  occupation was suspended to watch their master's movements. \"How  strange he looks!\" whispered one; \"something's the matter.\"  Dr. Wilkinson took no notice of the open eyes and mouths of his  awe-struck pupils--all his aim seemed to be to reach his seat with  the greatest speed.    \"What's the row?\" muttered Salisbury, in an under-tone to Hamilton,  having some idea that the latter could afford a clue to the clearing  up of the mystery. \"Do you know of any thing, Hamilton?\" Hamilton  shook his head, and fairly stood up to see what was going on.    Dr. Wilkinson at length reached his place, and there stood a few  minutes to collect himself. He then looked around, and asked, in a  quick, low tone, for Louis Mortimer. Louis was almost behind him,  and in some terror presented himself; though he was unconscious of  any misdemeanor, he did not know what new suspicion might have attached  to him. His gentle \"Here, sir,\" was distinctly heard in every part of  the large room, in the breathless silence which now ruled. Dr. Wilkinson  looked on him, but there was no anger in his gaze--his eyes glistened,  and though there might be indignation mixed with the many emotions  struggling for expression in his countenance, Louis felt, as he raised  his timid eyes, that there was nothing now to fear. The doctor seemed  incapable of speaking; after one or two vain efforts he placed both  hands on Louis' head, and uttered a deep \"God bless you!\"    It would be impossible to describe the flood of rapture which this  action poured upon poor Louis. The endurance of the last few weeks was  amply repaid by the consciousness that somehow--and he did not consider  how--his innocence was established, and now, in the presence of his  school-fellows, publicly acknowledged.
