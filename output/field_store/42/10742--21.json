His drum is one of the most welcome and beautiful sounds of spring.  Scarcely have the trees expanded their buds, when, in the still April  mornings, or toward nightfall, you hear the hum of his devoted wings. He  selects, not, as you would predict, a dry and resinous log, but a  decayed and crumbling one, seeming to give the preference to old  oak-logs that are partly blended with the soil. If a log to his taste  cannot be found, he sets up his altar on a rock, which becomes resonant  beneath his fervent blows. Who has seen the partridge drum? It is the  next thing to catching a weasel asleep, though by much caution and tact  it may be done. He does not hug the log, but stands very erect, expands  his ruff, gives two introductory blows, pauses half a second, and then  resumes, striking faster and faster till the sound becomes a continuous,  unbroken whir, the whole lasting less than half a minute. The tips of  his wings barely brush the log, so that the sound is produced rather by  the force of the blows upon the air and upon his own body as in flying.  One log will be used for many years, though not by the same drummer. It  seems to be a sort of temple and held in great respect. The bird always  approaches on foot, and leaves it in the same quiet manner, unless  rudely disturbed. He is very cunning, though his wit is not profound. It  is difficult to approach him by stealth; you will try many times before  succeeding; but seem to pass by him in a great hurry, making all the  noise possible, and with plumage furled he stands as immovable as a  knot, allowing you a good view.    The sharp-rayed track of the partridge adds another figure to the  fantastic embroidery upon the winter snow. Her course is a clear, strong  line, sometimes quite wayward, but generally very direct, steering for  the densest, most impenetrable places,--leading you over logs and  through brush, alert and expectant, till, suddenly, she bursts up a few  yards from you, and goes humming through the trees,--the complete  triumph of endurance and vigor. Hardy native bird, may your tracks never  be fewer, or your visits to the birch-tree less frequent!      THE PARTRIDGE        List the booming from afar,        Soft as hum of roving bee,      Vague as when on distant bar        Fall the cataracts of the sea.        Yet again, a sound astray,        Was it the humming of the mill?      Was it cannon leagues away?        Or dynamite beyond the hill?        'T is the grouse with kindled soul,        Wistful of his mate and nest,      Sounding forth his vernal roll        On his love-enkindled breast.        List his fervid morning drum,        List his summons soft and deep,      Calling Spice-bush till she come,        Waking Bloodroot from her sleep.        Ah! ruffled drummer, let thy wing        Beat a march the days will heed,      Wake and spur the tardy spring,      Till minstrel voices jocund ring,        And spring is spring in very deed.          THE CROW      The crow may not have the sweet voice which the fox in his flattery  attributed to him, but he has a good, strong, native speech  nevertheless. How much character there is in it! How much thrift and  independence! Of course his plumage is firm, his color decided, his wit  quick. He understands you at once and tells you so; so does the hawk by  his scornful, defiant _whir-r-r-r-r_. Hardy, happy outlaws, the crows,  how I love them! Alert, social, republican, always able to look out for  himself, not afraid of the cold and the snow, fishing when flesh is  scarce, and stealing when other resources fail, the crow is a character  I would not willingly miss from the landscape. I love to see his track  in the snow or the mud, and his graceful pedestrianism about the brown  fields.    He is no interloper, but has the air and manner of being thoroughly at  home, and in rightful possession of the land. He is no sentimentalist  like some of the plaining, disconsolate song-birds, but apparently is  always in good health and good spirits. No matter who is sick, or  dejected, or unsatisfied, or what the weather is, or what the price of  corn, the crow is well and finds life sweet. He is the dusky embodiment  of worldly wisdom and prudence. Then he is one of Nature's  self-appointed constables and greatly magnifies his office. He would  fain arrest every hawk or owl or grimalkin that ventures abroad. I have  known a posse of them to beset the fox and cry \"Thief!\" till Reynard hid  himself for shame. Do I say the fox flattered the crow when he told him  he had a sweet voice? Yet one of the most musical sounds in nature  proceeds from the crow. All the crow tribe, from the blue jay up, are  capable of certain low ventriloquial notes that have peculiar cadence  and charm. I often hear the crow indulging in his in winter, and am  reminded of the sound of the dulcimer. The bird stretches up and exerts  himself like a cock in the act of crowing, and gives forth a peculiarly  clear, vitreous sound that is sure to arrest and reward your attention.  This is, no doubt, the song the fox begged to be favored with, as in  delivering it the crow must inevitably let drop the piece of meat.    The crow has fine manners. He always has the walk and air of a lord of  the soil. One morning I put out some fresh meat upon the snow near my  study window. Presently a crow came and carried it off, and alighted  with it upon the ground in the vineyard. While he was eating it,  another crow came, and, alighting a few yards away, slowly walked up to  within a few feet of this fellow and stopped. I expected to see a  struggle over the food, as would have been the case with domestic fowls  or animals. Nothing of the kind. The feeding crow stopped eating,  regarded the other for a moment, made a gesture or two, and flew away.  Then the second crow went up to the food, and proceeded to take his  share. Presently the first crow came back, when each seized a portion of  the food and flew away with it. Their mutual respect and good-will  seemed perfect. Whether it really was so in our human sense, or whether  it was simply an illustration of the instinct of mutual support which  seems to prevail among gregarious birds, I know not. Birds that are  solitary in their habits, like hawks or woodpeckers, behave quite  differently toward each other in the presence of their food.    The crow will quickly discover anything that looks like a trap or snare  set to catch him, but it takes him a long time to see through the  simplest contrivance. As I have above stated, I sometimes place meat on  the snow in front of my study window to attract him. On one occasion,  after a couple of crows had come to expect something there daily, I  suspended a piece of meat by a string from a branch of the tree just  over the spot where I usually placed the food. A crow soon discovered  it, and came into the tree to see what it meant. His suspicions were  aroused. There was some design in that suspended meat, evidently. It was  a trap to catch him. He surveyed it from every near branch. He peeked  and pried, and was bent on penetrating the mystery. He flew to the  ground, and walked about and surveyed it from all sides. Then he took a  long walk down about the vineyard as if in hope of hitting upon some  clew. Then he came to the tree again, and tried first one eye, then the  other, upon it; then to the ground beneath; then he went away and came  back; then his fellow came, and they both squinted and investigated, and  then disappeared. Chickadees and woodpeckers would alight upon the meat  and peck it swinging in the wind, but the crows were fearful. Does this  show reflection? Perhaps it does, but I look upon it rather as that  instinct of fear and cunning so characteristic of the crow. Two days  passed thus: every morning the crows came and surveyed the suspended  meat from all points in the tree, and then went away. The third day I  placed a large bone on the snow beneath the suspended morsel. Presently  one of the crows appeared in the tree, and bent his eye upon the  tempting bone. \"The mystery deepens,\" he seemed to say to himself. But  after half an hour's investigation, and after approaching several times  within a few feet of the food upon the ground, he seemed to conclude  there was no connection between it and the piece hanging by the string.  So he finally walked up to it and fell to pecking it, flickering his  wings all the time, as a sign of his watchfulness. He also turned up his  eye, momentarily, to the piece in the air above, as if it might be some  disguised sword of Damocles ready to fall upon him. Soon his mate came  and alighted on a low branch of the tree. The feeding crow regarded him  a moment, and then flew up to his side, as if to give him a turn at the  meat. But he refused to run the risk. He evidently looked upon the whole  thing as a delusion and a snare, and presently went away, and his mate  followed him. Then I placed the bone in one of the main forks of the  tree, but the crows kept at a safe distance from it. Then I put it back  to the ground, but they grew more and more suspicious; some evil intent  in it all, they thought. Finally a dog carried off the bone, and the  crows ceased to visit the tree.           *       *       *       *       *    From my boyhood I have seen the yearly meeting of the crows in September  or October, on a high grassy hill or a wooded ridge. Apparently, all  the crows from a large area assemble at these times; you may see them  coming, singly or in loose bands, from all directions to the rendezvous,  till there are hundreds of them together. They make black an acre or two  of ground. At intervals they all rise in the air, and wheel about, all  cawing at once. Then to the ground again, or to the tree-tops, as the  case may be; then, rising again, they send forth the voice of the  multitude.

It was written in the diary that night: \"I remember no  day in my life so full of toil, distress, and exhaustion, and yet so  full of happiness and keen gratification.\"    [Sidenote: The Amber Glasses Again]    The culminating day should not be allowed to pass without another  tribute to the efficiency of the amber glasses. Notwithstanding the  glare of the sun at twenty thousand feet and upward, no one had the  slightest irritation of the eyes. There has never been an April of  travel on the Yukon in eight years that the writer has not suffered from  inflammation of the eyes despite the darkest smoke-colored glasses that  could be procured. A naked candle at a road-house would give a stab of  pain every time the eyes encountered it, and reading would become almost  impossible. The amber glasses, however, while leaving vision almost as  bright as without them, filter out the rays that cause the irritation  and afford perfect protection against the consequences of sun and glare.  There is only one improvement to make in the amber glasses, and that is  some device of air-tight cells that shall prevent them from fogging when  the cold on the outside of the glass condenses the moisture of  perspiration on the inside of the glass. We use double-glazed sashes  with an air space between on all windows in our houses in Alaska and  find ourselves no longer incommoded by frost on the panes; some  adaptation of this principle should be within the skill of the optician  and would remove a very troublesome defect in all snow-glasses.    If some one would invent a preventive against shortness of breath as  efficient as amber glasses are against snow-blindness, climbing at great  altitudes would lose all its terrors for one mountaineer. So far as it  was possible to judge, no other member of the party was near his  altitude limit. There seemed no reason why Karstens and Walter in  particular should not go another ten thousand feet, were there a  mountain in the world ten thousand feet higher than Denali, but the  writer knows that he himself could not have gone much higher.    FOOTNOTE:    [4] The dotted line on the photograph opposite page 346 of Mr. Belmore  Browne's book, \"The Conquest of Mt. McKinley,\" does not, in the writer's  opinion, represent the real course taken by Professor Parker, Mr.  Belmore Browne, and Merl La Voy in their approach to the summit, and it  is easy to understand the confusion of direction in the fierce storm  that descended upon the party. If, as the dots show, the party went to  the summit of the right-hand peak, they went out of their way and had  still a considerable distance to travel. \"Perhaps five minutes of easy  walking would have taken us to the highest point,\" says Mr. Browne. It  is probably more than a mile from the summit of the snow peak shown in  the picture to the actual summit of the mountain. One who took that  course would have to descend from the peak and then ascend the horseshoe  ridge, and the highest point of the horseshoe ridge is perhaps two  hundred feet above the summit of this snow peak. In the opinion that  Professor Parker expressed to the writer, the dotted lines should bear  much more to the left, making directly for the centre of the horseshoe  ridge, which is the obvious course. But it should again be said that men  in the circumstances and condition of this party when forced to turn  back, may be pardoned for mistaking the exact direction in which they  had been proceeding.          CHAPTER VI    THE RETURN      The next day was another bright, cloudless day, the second and last of  them. Perhaps never did men abandon as cheerfully stuff that had been  freighted as laboriously as we abandoned our surplus baggage at the  eighteen-thousand-foot camp. We made a great pile of it in the lee of  one of the ice-blocks of the glacier--food, coal-oil, clothing, and  bedding--covering all with the wolf-robe and setting up a shovel as a  mark; though just why we cached it so carefully, or for whom, no one of  us would be able to say. It will probably be a long time ere any others  camp in that Grand Basin. While yet such a peak is unclimbed, there is  constant goading of mountaineering minds to its conquest; once its top  has been reached, the incentive declines. Much exploring work is yet to  do on Denali; the day will doubtless come when all its peaks and ridges  and glaciers will be duly mapped, but our view from the summit agreed  with our study of its conformation during the ascent, that no other  route will be found to the top. When first we were cutting and climbing  on the ridge, and had glimpses, as the mists cleared, of the glacier on  the other side and the ridges that arose from it, we thought that  perhaps they might afford a passage, but from above the appearance  changed and seemed to forbid it altogether. At times, almost in despair  at the task which the Northeast Ridge presented, we would look across at  the ice-covered rocks of the North Peak and dream that they might be  climbed, but they are really quite impossible. The south side has been  tried again and again and no approach discovered, nor did it appear from  the top that such approach exists; the west side is sheer precipice; the  north side is covered with a great hanging glacier and is devoid of  practicable slopes; it has been twice attempted. Only on the northeast  has the glacier cut so deeply into the mountain as to give access to the  heights.    June 8th was Sunday, but we had to take advantage of the clear, bright  day to get as far down the mountain as possible. The stuff it was still  necessary to pack made good, heavy loads, and we knew not what had  happened to our staircase in our absence.    [Sidenote: The Record]    Having said Morning Prayer, we left at 9.30 A. M., after a night in  which all of us slept soundly--the first sound sleep some had enjoyed  for a long time. Contentment and satisfaction are great somnifacients.  The Grand Basin was glorious in sunshine, the peaks crystal-clear  against a cloudless sky, the huge blocks of ice thrown down by the  earthquake and scattered all over the glacier gleamed white in the  sunshine, deep-blue in the shadow. We wound our way downward, passing  camp site after camp site, until at the first place we camped in the  Grand Basin we stopped for lunch. Then we made the traverse under the  cliffs to the Parker Pass, which we reached at 1.30 P. M. The sun was  hot; there was not a breath of wind; we were exceedingly thirsty and we  decided to light the primus stove and make a big pot of tea and  replenish the thermos bottles before attempting the descent of the  ridge. While this was doing a place was found to cache the minimum  thermometer and a tin can that had held a photographic film, in which we  had placed a record of our ascent. Above, we had not found any  distinctive place in which a record could be deposited with the  assurance that it would be found by any one seeking it. One feels sure  that in the depth of winter very great cold must occur even at this  elevation. Yet we should have liked to leave it much higher. Without  some means, which we did not possess, of marking a position, there  would, however, have been little use in leaving it amid the boulders  where we hunted unsuccessfully for Professor Parker's instrument. We had  hoped to be able to grave some sign upon the rocks with the geological  hammer, but the first time it was brought down upon the granite its  point splintered in the same exasperating way that the New York dealer's  fancy ice-axes behaved when it was attempted to put them to practical  use. \"Warranted cast steel\" upon an implement ought to be a warning not  to purchase it for mountain work. Tool-steel alone will serve.    Our little record cache at the Parker Pass, placed at the foot of the  west or upward-facing side of the great slab which marks the natural  camping site, should stand there for many years. It is not a place where  snow lies deep or long, and it will surely be found by any who seek it.  We took our last looks up into the Grand Basin, still brilliant in the  sunshine, our last looks at the summit, still cloudless and clear. There  was a melancholy even in the midst of triumph in looking for the last  time at these scenes where we had so greatly hoped and endeavored--and  had been so amply rewarded. We recalled the eager expectation with which  we first gazed up between these granite slabs into the long-hidden  basin, a week before, and there was sadness in the feeling that in all  probability we should never have this noble view again.    [Sidenote: Harper Glacier]    Before the reader turns his back upon the Grand Basin once for all, I  should like to put a name upon the glacier it contains--since it is the  fashion to name glaciers. I should like to call it the Harper Glacier,  after my half-breed companion of three years, who was the first human  being to reach the summit of the mountain. This reason might suffice,  but there is another and most interesting reason for associating the  name Harper with this mountain. Arthur Harper, Walter's father, the  pioneer of all Alaskan miners, \"the first man who thought of trying the  Yukon as a mining field so far as we know,\" as William Ogilvie tells us  in his \"Early Days on the Yukon\"[5] (and none had"]]]
