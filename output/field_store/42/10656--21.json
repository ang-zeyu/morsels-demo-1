The martyr is seen coming forth from his  shrine in full pontifical robes, and making his way towards the altar as  if to celebrate mass. This window is noticeable as containing the only  representation that now exists of the shrine itself--for the picture in  the Cottonian MSS. evidently shows us, not the shrine, but its outer  shell, or covering. \"The medallion,\" says Austin, \"is the more  interesting, from being an undoubted work of the thirteenth century; and  having been designed for a position immediately opposite to and within a  few yards of the shrine itself, and occupying the place of honour in the  largest and most important window, without doubt represents the main  features of the shrine faithfully.\"    On the north side of the Trinity Chapel, immediately opposite the tomb of  the Black Prince, is that of King Henry IV., who died in 1413, and his  second consort, Joan of Navarre, who followed him in 1437. This king had  made liberal offerings towards the rebuilding of the nave of the  cathedral, and it has been conjectured that one of the figures on the  organ-screen represents him: his will ordered that he should be laid to  rest in the church at Canterbury, and here accordingly he was buried on  the Trinity Sunday after his death. The tomb, with its rich canopy, is a  beautiful piece of work, and the figures of the king and queen are  probably faithful representations. A curious story was circulated by the  Yorkists, to the effect that Henry was never buried here, but that his  body was thrown into the water between Gravesend and Barking, during the  voyage of the funeral _cortege_ to Faversham, and that only an empty  coffin was laid in the Trinity Chapel. That this point might be cleared  up, the tomb was opened in 1832 in the presence of the Dean, and there the  king was found in perfect preservation, and bearing a close resemblance to  the effigy on the monument--\"the nose elevated, the beard thick and  matted, and of a deep russet colour, and the jaws perfect, with all the  teeth in them, except one foretooth.\"    In the wall of the north aisle, just opposite the king's tomb, is a small  chapel, built according to the directions contained in his will \"that ther  be a chauntre perpetuall with twey prestis for to sing and prey for my  soul.\" The roof shows the first piece of fan-vaulting admitted into the  cathedral. On the eastern wall an account is scratched of the cost of a  reredos which once stood here, but has been entirely destroyed: it tells  us that the cost of \"ye middil image was xix^s 11^d.\" This chapel was  doubtless used at one time as a storehouse of sacred relics. Two recesses  in the west wall have lately been chosen to receive certain archiepiscopal  vestments which were discovered in a tomb on the south side of Trinity  Chapel, which was long believed to be that of Archbishop Theobald.    To the east of Henry IV.'s monument is the tomb of Dean Wotton, adorned  with his kneeling figure. He was the first Dean of Canterbury after the  reorganization by Henry VIII. Opposite to him is an unsightly brick  erection which was once intended as a temporary covering for the remains  of Odo Coligny, Cardinal of Chatillon and brother of Admiral Coligny, who  was one of the victims of the massacre of St. Bartholomew. The Cardinal  fled from France in 1568, on account of his leanings towards the tenets of  the Huguenots, and was welcomed by Queen Elizabeth. It is believed that  he died from the effects of a poisoned apple given to him by a servant. It  seems curious that the French Huguenots who settled in Canterbury never  provided him with a more fitting monument.    Between this tomb and that of the Black Prince is the monument of  Archbishop Courtenay, who was primate from 1381 to 1396, and was  celebrated for his severity towards Wycliffe and his followers. He was  a large contributor to the fund for the re-building of the nave, which  perhaps accounts for the distinguished position of his tomb; the fact also  that he was executor to the Black Prince may be responsible for his being  buried at his feet. It is not, however, certain that his body actually  lies here, though the ledger book of the cathedral states that he was  buried within the walls of the church. It is known, however, that he died  at Maidstone, and that he ordered in his will that his remains should rest  there, and a slab in the pavement of All Saints', Maidstone, shows traces  of a brass representing the figure of an archbishop, whence it has been  concluded that Courtenay was in fact buried there, and that his monument  in Canterbury is only a cenotaph.    [Illustration: TRINITY CHAPEL, LOOKING INTO THE CORONA, \"BECKET'S CROWN,\"  WITH CHAIR OF ST. AUGUSTINE.]    #Becket's Crown.#--The circular apse at the extreme east end of the church  is known as Becket's Crown. The name has caused a good deal of discussion.  The theory once generally received was to the effect that the portion of  Becket's skull which was cut away by Richard le Breton was preserved here  as a relic of special sanctity. We know that the Black Prince bequeathed,  by his will, tapestry hangings for the High Altar and for three others,  viz., \"l'autier la ou Mons'r Saint Thomas gist--l'autier la ou la teste  est--l'autier la ou la poynte de l'espie est.\" The first and last are  evidently the altars at the shrine and in the Chapel of the Martyrdom, and  it has been contended that the altar \"where the head is\" was the altar of  which traces may still be seen in the pavement of the corona, or Becket's  Crown. Against this notion we must place the authority of Erasmus, whose  words plainly show that the martyr's head was displayed in the crypt:  \"_hinc digressi subimus cryptoporticum: illic primum exhibetur calvaria  martyris perforata_ (the martyr's pierced tonsure): _reliqua tecta sunt  argento, summa cranii pars nuda patet osculo_.\" While Willis considers  that the term corona was a common one for an apse at the end of a  church, citing \"Ducange's Glossary,\" which defines \"Corona Ecclesiae\" as  _Pars templi choro postica, quod ea pars fere desinat in circulum_; \"at  all events,\" he concludes, \"it was a general term and not peculiar to  Christ Church, Canterbury. The notion that this round chapel was called  Becket's Crown, because part of his skull was preserved here as a relic,  appears wholly untenable. There is at least no doubt that a relic of  some sort was preserved here, because we know from a record of the  offerings--Oblaciones S. Thomae--during ten years in the first half of the  thirteenth century, that the richest gifts were made at the shrine and in  the corona. And we know that the spot was one of peculiar sanctity from  the fact that the shrines of St. Odo and St. Wilfrid were finally  transferred thither. _Corpus S. Odonis in feretro, ad coronam versus  austrum. Corpus S. Wilfridi in feretro ad coronam versus aquilonem._\"    [Illustration: CHAIR OF ST. AUGUSTINE.]    On the north side of the corona is the tomb of Cardinal Pole, the last  Archbishop of Canterbury who acknowledged the supremacy of the Pope. He  held office from 1556 to 1558, and died the day after Queen Mary. Here  stands also the patriarchal chair, made out of three pieces of Purbeck  marble. It is called St. Augustine's chair, and is said to be the throne  on which the old kings of Kent were crowned; according to the tradition,  Ethelbert, on being converted, gave the chair to Augustine, from whom it  has descended to the Archbishops of Canterbury. It is needless to say  that this eminently attractive legend has been attacked and overthrown  by modern criticism. It is pointed out that the original archiepiscopal  throne was of one piece only, and that Purbeck marble did not come into  use until some time after Augustine's death. From its shape it is  conjectured that the chair dates from the end of the twelfth century or  the beginning of the thirteenth, and that it may have been constructed for  the ceremony of the translation of St. Thomas' relics. It is in this  chair, and not in the archiepiscopal throne in the choir, that the  archbishops are still enthroned. From the corona we have a view of the  full length of the cathedral, which measures 514 feet, and is one of the  longest of English cathedrals. Of the windows in Becket's Crown, the  centre one is ancient, while the rest are modern and afford a most  instructive contrast.    #St. Andrew's Tower, or Chapel.#--Leaving the Trinity Chapel, and  descending the steps, we find on our right the door of St. Andrew's Chapel  which is now used as a vestry. Formerly, it was the sacristy, a place from  which the pilgrims of humble rank were excluded, but where those of wealth  and high station were allowed to gaze at a great array of silken vestments  and golden candlesticks, and also the Martyr's pearwood pastoral staff with  its black horn crook, and his cloak and bloodstained kerchief. Here also  was a chest \"cased with black leather, and opened with the utmost  reverence on bended knees, containing scraps and rags of linen with which  (the story must be told throughout) the saint wiped his forehead and blew  his nose\" (Stanley). Erasmus describes this exhibition with a touch of  scorn. \"_Fragmenta linteorum lacera plerumque macci vestigium servantia.  His, ut aiebant, vir pius extergebat sudorem e facie_,\" etc. The walls of  this chapel show many traces of fresco decoration: the pattern seems to  have consisted of a clustering vine tree spread over the roof. In the  north wall is a Norman chamber which originally served as the Treasury;  the door is still secured by three locks, the keys of which were held by  different officials. St. Andrew's Chapel is part of Ernulf's work, and the  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284"],[0,"Animal Heroes (#17)"],[1," house, where it was kept safe from flies. Now they were  down to flour and tea. He was in despair, when his eye lighted on the  Chickens about the stable; but what's the use? In his feeble state he  might as well try to catch a Deer or a Hawk. Suddenly he remembered his  gun and very soon was preparing a fat Hen for the pot. He boiled it  whole as the easiest way to cook it, and the broth was the first really  tempting food they had had for some time.    They kept alive for three wretched days on that Chicken, and when it  was finished Thor again took down his gun--it seemed a much heavier gun  now. He crawled to the barn, but he was so weak and shaky that he  missed several times before he brought down a fowl. Corney had taken  the rifle away with him and three charges of gun ammunition were all  that now remained.    Thor was surprised to see how few Hens there were now, only three or  four. There used to be over a dozen. Three days later he made another  raid. He saw but one Hen and he used up his last ammunition to get that.    His daily routine now was a monotony of horror. In the morning, which  was his \"well time,\" he prepared a little food for the household and  got ready for the night of raging fever by putting a bucket of water on  a block at the head of each bunk. About one o'clock, with fearful  regularity, the chills would come on, with trembling from head to foot  and chattering teeth, and cold, cold, within and without. Nothing  seemed to give any warmth--fire seemed to have lost its power. There  was nothing to do but to lie and shake and suffer all the slow torture  of freezing to death and shaking to pieces. For six hours it would keep  up, and to the torture, nausea lent its horrid aid throughout; then  about seven or eight o'clock in the evening a change would come; a  burning fever set in; no ice could have seemed cool to him then;  water--water--was all he craved, and drank and drank until three or  four in the morning, when the fever would abate, and a sleep of total  exhaustion followed.    \"If you run out of food take the canoe to Ellerton's,\" was the  brother's last word. Who was to take the canoe?    There was but half a Chicken now between them and starvation, and no  sign of Corney.    For three interminable weeks the deadly program dragged along. It went  on the same yet worse, as the sufferers grew weaker--a few days more  and the Boy also would be unable to leave his couch. Then what?    Despair was on the house and the silent cry of each was, \"Oh, God! will  Corney never come?\"      V    THE HOME OF THE BOY    On the day of that last Chicken, Thor was all morning carrying water  enough for the coming three fevers. The chill attacked him sooner than  it was due and his fever was worse than ever before.    He drank deeply and often from the bucket at his head. He had filled  it, and it was nearly emptied when about two in the morning the fever  left him and he fell asleep.    In the gray dawn he was awakened by a curious sound not far away--a  splashing of water. He turned his head to see two glaring eyes within a  foot of his face--a great Beast lapping the water in the bucket by his  bed.    Thor gazed in horror for a moment, then closed his eyes, sure that he  was dreaming, certain that this was a nightmare of India with a Tiger  by his couch; but the lapping continued. He looked up; yes, it still  was there. He tried to find his voice but uttered only a gurgle. The  great furry head quivered, a sniff came from below the shining  eyeballs, and the creature, whatever it was, dropped to its front feet  and went across the hut under the table. Thor was fully awake now; he  rose slowly on his elbow and feebly shouted \"Sssh-hi,\" at which the  shining eyes reappeared under the table and the gray form came forth.  Calmly it walked across the ground and glided under the lowest log at a  place where an old potato pit left an opening and disappeared. What was  it? The sick boy hardly knew--some savage Beast of prey, undoubtedly.  He was totally unnerved. He shook with fear and a sense of  helplessness, and the night passed in fitful sleep and sudden starts  awake to search the gloom again for those fearful eyes and the great  gray gliding form. In the morning he did not know whether it were not  all a delirium, yet he made a feeble effort to close the old cellar  hole with some firewood.    The three had little appetite, but even that they restrained since now  they were down to part of a Chicken, and Corney, evidently he supposed  they had been to Ellerton's and got all the food they needed.    Again that night, when the fever left him weak and dozing, Thor was  awakened by a noise in the room, a sound of crunching bones. He looked  around to see dimly outlined against the little window, the form of a  large animal on the table. Thor shouted; he tried to hurl his boot at  the intruder. It leaped lightly to the ground and passed out of the  hole, again wide open.    It was no dream this time, he knew, and the women knew it, too; not  only had they heard the creature, but the Chicken, the last of their  food, was wholly gone.    Poor Thor barely left his couch that day. It needed all the querulous  complaints of the sick women to drive him forth. Down by the spring he  found a few berries and divided them with the others. He made his usual  preparations for the chills and the thirst, but he added this--by the  side of his couch he put an old fish-spear--the only weapon he could  find, now the gun was useless--a pine-root candle and some matches. He  knew the Beast was coming back again--was coming hungry. It would find  no food; what more natural, he thought, than take the living prey lying  there so helpless? And a vision came of the limp brown form of the  little Fawn, borne off in those same cruel jaws.    Once again he barricaded the hole with firewood, and the night passed  as usual, but without any fierce visitor. Their food that day was flour  and water, and to cook it Thor was forced to use some of his barricade.  Loo attempted some feeble joke, guessed she was light enough to fly now  and tried to rise, but she got no farther than the edge of the bunk.  The same preparations were made, and the night wore on, but early in  the morning, Thor was again awakened rudely by the sound of lapping  water by his bed, and there, as before, were the glowing eyeballs, the  great head, the gray form relieved by the dim light from the dawning  window.    Thor put all his strength into what was meant for a bold shout, but it  was merely a feeble screech. He rose slowly and called out: \"Loo,  Margat! The Lynx--here's the Lynx again!\"    \"May God help ye, for we can't,\" was the answer.    \"Sssh-hi!\" Thor tried again to drive the Beast away. It leaped on to  the table by the window and stood up growling under the useless gun.  Thor thought it was going to leap through the glass as it faced the  window a moment; but it turned and glared toward the Boy, for he could  see both eyes shining. He rose slowly to the side of his bunk and he  prayed for help, for he felt it was kill or be killed. He struck a  match and lighted his pine-root candle, held that in his left hand and  in his right took the old fish-spear, meaning to fight, but he was so  weak he had to use the fish-spear as a crutch. The great Beast stood on  the table still, but was crouching a little as though for a spring. Its  eyes glowed red in the torchlight. Its short tail was switching from  side to side and its growling took a higher pitch. Thor's knees were  smiting together, but he levelled the spear and made a feeble lunge  toward the brute. It sprang at the same moment, not at him, as he first  thought--the torch and the boy's bold front had had effect--it went  over his head to drop on the ground beyond and at once to slink under  the bunk.    This was only a temporary repulse. Thor set the torch on a ledge of the  logs, then took the spear in both hands. He was fighting for his life,  and he knew it. He heard the voices of the women feebly praying. He saw  only the glowing eyes under the bed and heard the growling in higher  pitch as the Beast was nearing action. He steadied himself by a great  effort and plunged the spear with all the force he could give it.    It struck something softer than the logs: a hideous snarl came forth.  The boy threw all his weight on the weapon; the Beast was struggling to  get at him; he felt its teeth and claws grating on the handle, and in  spite of himself it was coming on; its powerful arms and claws were  reaching for him now; he could not hold out long. He put on all his  force, just a little more it was than before; the Beast lurched, there  was a growling, a crack, and a sudden yielding; the rotten old  spear-head had broken off, the Beast sprang out--at him--past  him--never touched him, but across through the hole and away, to be  seen no more.    Thor fell on the bed and lost all consciousness.    He lay there he knew not how long, but was awakened in broad daylight  by a loud, cheery voice:    \"Hello! Hello!--are ye all dead? Loo! Thor! Margat!\"    He had no strength to answer, but there was a trampling of horses  outside, a heavy step, the door was forced open, and in strode Corney,  handsome and hearty as ever. But what a flash of horror and pain came  over his face on entering the silent shanty!    \"Dead?\" he gasped. \"Who's dead--where are you? Thor?\" Then, \"Who is it?  Loo? Margat?\"    \"Corney--Corney,\" came feebly from the bunk. \"They're in there. They're  awful sick. We have nothing to eat.\"    \"Oh, what a fool I be!\" said Corney again and again. \"I made sure ye'd  go to Ellerton's and get all ye wanted.\"    \"We had no chance, Corney; we were all three brought down at once,  right after you left. Then the Lynx came and cleared up the Hens, and  all in the house, too.\"    \"Well, ye got even with her,\" and Corney pointed to the trail of blood  across the mud floor and out under"]]]
