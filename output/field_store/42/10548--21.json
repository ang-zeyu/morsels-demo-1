At the same time the Balkan States received due  warning regarding their dealings with Turkey, and were made to take a  pledge that whenever they had troubles with the Porte the powers and  not themselves were to be the arbiters. All the world knows how  Turkey, by constant wire-pulling, secured immunity from Europe for not  fulfilling the obligations incumbent on her by the Treaty of Berlin,  and how one of the Balkan States, namely, Greece, was left alone and  unprotected, to be chastised by Turkey in 1897 for not leaving to the  powers the settlement of the Cretan question which had brought about  the war.    The European powers, having done practically nothing during  thirty-five years for the betterment of the conditions under which the  non-Moslem populations had to live in Turkey, were overwhelmed to hear  in the Autumn of 1912 the news of a series of alliances concluded at  Sofia on June 12 between Bulgaria and Servia, and between Bulgaria and  Greece, for the purpose of settling once for all the perennial Balkan  question. European diplomacy was slow, as usual, in grasping the  meaning of the new alliance, and when, on Oct. 5, 1912, Montenegro  suddenly declared war on Turkey, with Servia, Bulgaria, and Greece  following suit on the 18th, there was consternation in London, Paris,  Berlin, Vienna, Rome, and, to a certain degree, in Petrograd.    An idea of the unpreparedness of European diplomacy in the face of the  sudden Balkan war can be had by simply glancing at the records of the  British House of Commons of the first weeks after the war was  declared.    Sir Edward Grey, then and now Foreign Secretary of State for Great  Britain, making the first announcement of the rupture between Turkey  and the Balkan States, said--exposing the views not only of his  Government but of the European concert as well--that Europe, being  taken unawares, would not permit any alteration of the Balkan  frontiers as the result of the war. After the first victories of the  Balkan allies we see Great Britain changing her policy. \"The Balkan  victors shall not be deprived of the fruits of their victories,\"  Premier Asquith was declaring in Parliament less than a fortnight  after Sir Edward spoke. In both these instances the British statesmen  were voicing the policy of the European concert taken as a whole. In  the first place, the Foreign Secretary was led into believing that  Turkey might prove victorious against the Balkan coalition, and the  warning about the immutability of the Balkan frontiers was only for  Turkey, in case her victorious armies were to cross the boundaries  into Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro, and Greece.    When events marked the utter collapse of the Turkish campaign, Premier  Asquith came out with the declaration that Europe had agreed on a  policy safeguarding the interests of the victorious Balkan allies.  This policy was maintained as long as the Balkan victories were  confined in their first progress toward Ottoman territory, at the same  time leaving the great European interests unharmed. But when Servian  troops arrived at Durazzo, and Montenegro entered Scutari while Greece  kept pushing on to Avlona and Bulgaria stood before Tchataldja, the  European concert was no longer unanimous in safeguarding the interests  of the victors.    Austria, seeing her secular dream of a descent on Saloniki definitely  destroyed, and feeling at the same time the imperative need of making  impossible a Servian occupation of the Adriatic littoral, raised her  voice in favor of the creation of an autonomous Albania at the expense  of Servia, Montenegro, and Greece.    Italy, and then Germany, joined their ally in support of Albania.  Russia, at the same time not wishing to give any greater impetus to  the Bulgarian campaign, dexterously manipulated Rumania, which raised  at that time her first claims on Dobrudja. France, who for the last  twenty-five years has subjected her Near Eastern policy to the  exigencies of the Petrograd statesmen, agreed to the Albanian  proposals of the four powers, and finally Great Britain, fearing  complications, declared abruptly through Sir Edward Grey that the  Balkan war was one of conquest, and for that reason subject to  European intervention. In this way European diplomacy stepped into the  Balkan conflict and took charge of the final settlement of the first  war.    The resolution to interfere in the war once taken, the European powers  lost no time in finding a way to end the conflict, and with this  object in mind they forced on the belligerents two successive  armistices, culminating in the two peace conferences of London. These  armistices served two purposes from the diplomatic point of view;  first, they exhausted financially the little Balkan countries; and,  secondly, they prepared public opinion for the acceptance of any peace  terms. The second conference in London succeeded in forcing a peace  treaty on the Balkan States. With the exception of Bulgaria, who hoped  to retain most of the Turkish territory won by the Balkan coalition,  every one was dissatisfied with the way the London conference ended.    Turkey, on one hand, was losing more territory than at first imagined,  as the result of her defeat, and the loss of Adrianople was especially  hard for every Turk.    Greece was obliged to sign a peace treaty giving her vague and  indefinite boundaries and leaving out the question of the Aegean  Islands and Epirus, to be settled at a later date by another  conference of the Ambassadors of the six great powers in London.    Servia also had to wait for the realization of her fondest hope, which  was to obtain a free commercial access to the Adriatic by way of  Durazzo or San Giovanni di Medua. That question also was to be decided  by the Ambassadorial conference. Montenegro was to lose Scutari, for  which she had shed her heart's blood, without getting at the same time  any adequate compensation. Such was the Peace of London, from the  strictly Balkan point of view, and its conclusion in May, 1913, was  the signal for the disruption of the Balkan League and the forerunner  of the second war. One month later Bulgaria, having fallen under  Austrian influences, quarreled with Servia and Greece over the  division of certain Macedonian territories, and on June 16 (29, new  style) all of a sudden attacked her erstwhile allies, thereby bringing  about the second Balkan conflict, with Greece, Servia, and Montenegro  united against her. The outcome of this war, the entry of Rumania and  Turkey into the field against Bulgaria, the tearing up of the London  Treaty, and the settlement of Bucharest are too well known to need an  extensive mention here.    The Treaty of London once torn to pieces by the second Balkan war, it  remained for the great powers to find a new way of forcing their terms  on the recalcitrant Balkan States, and this they succeeded in doing by  adroitly using Rumania as the representative of European diplomacy.  Thus the Rumanian Army, without any provocation from Bulgaria, took  the field against her neighbor, and acted as a mediator and arbiter of  the second Balkan conflict.    The Greek, Servian, Montenegrin, and Bulgarian delegates who went to  Bucharest at the close of the war knew beforehand that behind the  actions of the Rumanian Government stood united the whole of European  diplomacy, again striving to put down once for all these insolent  little States who thought themselves emancipated from European  guardianship. These delegates knew quite well that there was no  escape, but they went, trying and hoping for the best. The Rumanian  \"Green Papers,\" published a short time after the Treaty of Bucharest  and covering a period between Sept. 20, 1912, and Aug. 1, 1913, give a  vivid and true story of the whole proceedings, showing once more what  a powerful instrument diplomacy is in the hands of the strong for  cheating the weak.    On Aug. 1, 1914, we see the Balkan Peninsula presenting the following  aspect:    From the erstwhile European Turkey, of six vilayets, or departments,  namely, those of Adrianople, Saloniki, Monastir, Uskub, Jannina, and  Scutari, only one, and that mutilated, remains, the Vilayet of  Adrianople. Greece, Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro, and Albania  appropriated the rest. Gone is Crete, and gone are the twenty-six  Aegean Islands, twelve of them permanently united to their Hellenic  motherland, while Italy temporarily occupies fourteen as a result of  the Tripolitan war of 1911. Thus Turkey, from an area of 168,500  square kilometers, and 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 inhabitants, forming her  European dominions, was reduced to about 30,000 square kilometers and  nearly 3,000,000 inhabitants, including the population of  Constantinople, amounting, according to the only available foreign  statistics, to 1,203,000 inhabitants. Of course Turkey has in Asia an  area of more than 2,000,000 square kilometers, with a population  approximating 20,000,000, but that, properly speaking, does not enter  into Balkan considerations.    Greece, after her two victorious wars, approximates 120,000 square  kilometers in territory, with more than 5,000,000 population.    Rumania has 139,690 square kilometers of area and 7,601,660 of  population.    Servia has an area of 87,300 square kilometers and a population of  4,256,000.    Bulgaria's area is 114,000 square kilometers, with 4,766,900 of  population.    Montenegro has an area of 14,180 square kilometers and half a million  in population, and, lastly, Albania, the newborn State, with its  scant hope of future political life, has an area of about 17,600  square kilometers, with an approximate population of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#17)"],[1,"urt. With a  supreme effort I got to it. We rallied. I was playing like a  professor. Then whizz!    The Doherty Slosh had beaten me on the post.    \"Game _and_--\" said Mr. Chase, twirling his racket into the air and  catching it by the handle. \"Good game that last one.\"    I turned to see what Phyllis thought of it. At the eleventh hour I had  shown her of what stuff I was made.    She had disappeared.    \"Looking for Miss Derrick?\" said Chase, jumping the net, and joining  me in my court; \"she's gone into the house.\"    \"When did she go?\"    \"At the end of the fifth game,\" said Chase.    \"Gone to dress for dinner, I suppose,\" he continued. \"It must be  getting late. I think I ought to be going, too, if you don't mind.  The professor gets a little restive if I keep him waiting for his  daily bread. Great Scott, that watch can't be right! What do you make  it? Yes, so do I. I really think I must run. You won't mind? Good  night, then. See you to-morrow, I hope.\"    I walked slowly out across the fields. That same star, in which I had  confided on a former occasion, was at its post. It looked placid and  cheerful. _It_ never got beaten by six games to love under the eyes of  its particular lady star. _It_ was never cut out ignominiously by  infernally capable lieutenants in his Majesty's navy. No wonder it was  cheerful.    It must be pleasant to be a star.          A COUNCIL OF WAR    XIV      \"The fact is,\" said Ukridge, \"if things go on as they are now, old  horse, we shall be in the cart. This business wants bucking up. We  don't seem to be making headway. What we want is time. If only these  scoundrels of tradesmen would leave us alone for a spell, we might get  things going properly. But we're hampered and worried and rattled all  the time. Aren't we, Millie?\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"You don't let me see the financial side of the thing,\" I said,  \"except at intervals. I didn't know we were in such a bad way. The  fowls look fit enough, and Edwin hasn't had one for a week.\"    \"Edwin knows as well as possible when he's done wrong, Mr. Garnet,\"  said Mrs. Ukridge. \"He was so sorry after he had killed those other  two.\"    \"Yes,\" said Ukridge. \"I saw to that.\"    \"As far as I can see,\" I continued, \"we're going strong. Chicken for  breakfast, lunch, and dinner is a shade monotonous, but look at the  business we're doing. We sold a whole heap of eggs last week.\"    \"It's not enough, Garny, my boy. We sell a dozen eggs where we ought  to be selling a hundred, carting them off in trucks for the London  market. Harrod's and Whiteley's and the rest of them are beginning to  get on their hind legs, and talk. That's what they're doing. You see,  Marmaduke, there's no denying it--we _did_ touch them for a lot of  things on account, and they agreed to take it out in eggs. They seem  to be getting tired of waiting.\"    \"Their last letter was quite pathetic,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    I had a vision of an eggless London. I seemed to see homes rendered  desolate and lives embittered by the slump, and millionaires bidding  against one another for the few specimens Ukridge had actually managed  to dispatch to Brompton and Bayswater.    \"I told them in my last letter but three,\" continued Ukridge  complainingly, \"that I proposed to let them have the eggs on the  _Times_ installment system, and they said I was frivolous. They said  that to send thirteen eggs as payment for goods supplied to the value  of twenty-five pounds one shilling and sixpence was mere trifling.  Trifling! when those thirteen eggs were absolutely all we had over  that week after Mrs. Beale had taken what she wanted for the kitchen.  I tell you what it is, old boy, that woman literally eats eggs.\"    \"The habit is not confined to her,\" I said.    \"What I mean to say is, she seems to bathe in them.\"    An impressive picture to one who knew Mrs. Beale.    \"She says she needs so many for puddings, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge. \"I  spoke to her about it yesterday. And, of course, we often have  omelets.\"    \"She can't make omelets without breakings eggs,\" I urged.    \"She can't make them without breaking us,\" said Ukridge. \"One or two  more omelets and we're done for. Another thing,\" he continued, \"that  incubator thing won't work. _I_ don't know what's wrong with it.\"    \"Perhaps it's your dodge of letting down the temperature.\"    I had touched upon a tender point.    \"My dear fellow,\" he said earnestly, \"there's nothing the matter with  my figures. It's a mathematical certainty. What's the good of  mathematics if not to help you work out that sort of thing? No,  there's something wrong with the machine itself, and I shall probably  make a complaint to the people I got it from. Where did we get the  incubator, Millie?\"    \"Harrod's, I think, dear. Yes, it was Harrod's. It came down with the  first lot of things from there.\"    \"Then,\" said Ukridge, banging the table with his fist, while his  glasses flashed triumph, \"we've got 'em! Write and answer that letter  of theirs to-night, Millie. Sit on them.\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"And tell 'em that we'd have sent 'em their confounded eggs weeks ago  if only their rotten, twopenny-ha'penny incubator had worked with any  approach to decency.\"    \"Or words to that effect,\" I suggested.    \"Add in a postscript that I consider that the manufacturer of the  thing ought to rent a padded cell at Earlswood, and that they are  scoundrels for palming off a groggy machine of that sort on me. I'll  teach them!\"    \"Yes, dear.\"    \"The ceremony of opening the morning's letters at Harrod's ought to be  full of interest and excitement to-morrow,\" I said.    This dashing counter stroke served to relieve Ukridge's pessimistic  mood. He seldom looked on the dark side of things for long at a time.  He began now to speak hopefully of the future. He planned out  ingenious, if somewhat impracticable, improvements in the farm. Our  fowls were to multiply so rapidly and consistently that within a short  space of time Dorsetshire would be paved with them. Our eggs were to  increase in size till they broke records, and got three-line notices  in the \"Items of Interest\" column of the _Daily Mail_. Briefly, each  hen was to become a happy combination of rabbit and ostrich.    \"There is certainly a good time coming,\" I said. \"May it be soon.  Meanwhile, there remain the local tradesmen. What of them?\"    Ukridge relapsed once more into pessimism.    \"They are the worst of the lot,\" he said. \"I don't mind about the  London men so much. They only write. And a letter or two hurts nobody.  But when it comes to butchers and bakers and grocers and fishmongers  and fruiterers, and what not, coming up to one's house and dunning one  in one's own garden--well, it's a little hard, what?\"    It may be wondered why, before things came to such a crisis, I had not  placed my balance at the bank at the disposal of the senior partner  for use on behalf of the firm. The fact was that my balance was at  the moment small. I have not yet in the course of this narrative gone  into my pecuniary position, but I may state here that it was an  inconvenient one. It was big with possibilities, but of ready cash  there was but a meager supply. My parents had been poor, but I had a  wealthy uncle. Uncles are notoriously careless of the comfort of their  nephews. Mine was no exception. He had views. He was a great believer  in matrimony, as, having married three wives--not, I should add,  simultaneously--he had every right to be. He was also of opinion that  the less money the young bachelor possessed, the better. The  consequence was that he announced his intention of giving me a  handsome allowance from the day that I married, but not an instant  before. Till that glad day I would have to shift for myself. And I am  bound to admit that--for an uncle--it was a remarkably sensible idea.  I am also of opinion that it is greatly to my credit, and a proof of  my pure and unmercenary nature, that I did not instantly put myself up  to be raffled for, or rush out into the streets and propose marriage  to the first lady I met. I was making enough with my pen to support  myself, and, be it ever so humble, there is something pleasant in a  bachelor existence, or so I had thought until very recently.    I had thus no great stake in Ukridge's chicken farm. I had contributed  a modest five pounds to the preliminary expenses, and another five  pounds after the roop incident. But further I could not go with  safety. When his income is dependent on the whims of editors and  publishers, the prudent man keeps something up his sleeve against a  sudden slump in his particular wares. I did not wish to have to make a  hurried choice between matrimony and the workhouse.    Having exhausted the subject of finance--or, rather, when I began to  feel that it was exhausting me--I took my clubs and strolled up the  hill to the links to play off a match with a sportsman from the  village. I had entered some days previously a competition for a trophy  (I quote the printed notice) presented by a local supporter of the  game, in which up to the present I was getting on nicely. I had  survived two rounds, and expected to beat my present opponent, which  would bring me into the semi-final. Unless I had bad luck, I felt that  I ought to get into the final, and win it. As far as I could gather  from watching the play of my rivals, the professor was the best of  them, and I was convinced that I should have no difficulty with him.  But he had the most extraordinary luck at golf, though he never  admitted it. He also exercised quite an uncanny influence on his  opponent. I have seen men put completely off their stroke by his good  fortune.    I disposed of my man without difficulty. We parted a little coldly. He  decapitated his brassy on the occasion of his striking Dorsetshire  instead of his ball, and he was slow in recovering from the complex  emotions which such an episode induces.    In the clubhouse I met the"]]]
