(2) Of  far more importance is the danger of the varicocele gradually  encroaching by pressure upon the testis, perhaps to cause a partial  atrophy of that gland. This condition is a comparatively rare one, and  inasmuch as it seldom occurs in both testes, the possibility of  causing sterility on the part of a man is remote.    The extension of the scrotum and the \"bearing-down\" sensation may be  relieved through the wearing of a suspensory bandage. Such a bandage  may be obtained at any drug store or surgical instrument house, and if  properly fitted, will usually relieve any such discomfort as described  above. If the varicocele is quite large, the subject will do well to  consult a competent surgeon and to take his advice.    5. _Is the emptying of the seminal vesicles thru nocturnal emission a  universal phenomenon among continent men?_    The nocturnal emission is not a universal method of emptying the  seminal vesicles. Some continent men never have nocturnal emissions.  The reason may be sought in one of two directions: (1) The usual cause  of absence of nocturnal emissions is to be found in the fact that in  the man in question the seminal vesicles are periodically drained by  _involuntary diurnal emissions_, occurring usually when the  individual is at stool. These emissions are likely to occur once in  two to four weeks and take the place of the nocturnal emission. (2)  Rarely we find virile, continent men whose vesicular secretion is so  scanty that they are never conscious of its emission.    6. (a) _Should a man who for three to six years of his boyhood  practiced masturbation think of wedlock?_    (b) _If one has not lived a pure life but has reformed, may he ask a  pure woman to be his wife?_    Such questions as these are very frequently asked and with most  serious motives. A vast majority of boys and young men who practice  self-abuse, do so either wholly ignorant of the fact that it is wrong  or cognizant only in a vague way of the evil of the practice.    To consign a man to the Hades of homelessness and the sorrow of  childlessness because through ignorance he lapsed from purity during a  few months or years of his life, would be meting out a retribution far  in excess of the sin. If nature intended such a retribution to be  meted out she would have led the way by causing an atrophy or some  other form of disease in the subject who had abused his sexual organs.  But nature does not do that. If the young man who, from his twelfth to  his eighteenth year, has practiced masturbation, is shown the error of  his way and breaks the habit absolutely, nature quickly comes to his  rescue and rehabilitates his virility completely, unless he has been  guilty of extreme excess in the habit. This rehabilitation of virility  after self-abuse is usually experienced in from one to three years,  according to the case and the extent of the practice.    The complete mastery of a habit after it has through years been  forging its chains about the youth, is in itself no small victory and  should go a long way towards extenuating his lapse. The young man who  can conquer himself and learn to lead a pure life, free from his early  habit and above reproach not only in his acts toward womankind but  also in all his thoughts of woman deserves his well-earned reward. He  deserves the respect of all pure women and should be able to win the  love of one whom he may with clear conscience ask to be his wife, and  with whom he may confidently expect to build a typical home.    7. _Should a man have intercourse for any purpose other than for  procreation?_    In the normal course of events, if intercourse is indulged in for  procreation only, it would come as often as once, perhaps twice in a  month; that is, either just before the menstrual period of the woman  or just after, the woman being most easily impregnated at these two  periods.    A man who has led a continent life before marriage should have no  difficulty in controlling his sexual appetite to that extent. If the  sexual intercourse occurs as infrequently as once or twice in a month,  the man, by living thus continently, will find it much more easy to  maintain his continence during the twelve-month period after his wife  becomes pregnant before he can properly have intercourse with her  again, than would be the case if he had had sexual relations much more  frequently.    That the man desires intercourse much more frequently than as above  outlined and that the woman, in the vast majority of cases, does not  desire intercourse except for procreation and about as frequently as  above indicated is, without any reasonable doubt, due to hereditary  tendencies. Under primeval conditions, and in fact, until  comparatively recent times, the vast majority of mankind were  polygamous, the strong men of the race--those who procreated their  kind--having as many wives as they could support and protect, the weak  men of the race being crowded aside, sometimes castrated, to become  the burden bearers for the strong.    Under conditions of polygamy the woman is rarely subjected to sexual  intercourse for other than procreative purposes, and even granting  that the man has intercourse for procreation only, if he had twelve  wives, he would be having it twelve times as frequently as any one of  them. That these experiences on the part of a long line of maternal  ancestors should lead the women of today to desire sexual intercourse  for procreation only, is easy to understand; that the impulses  transmitted along the paternal line of ancestors should lead the men  of today to desire intercourse far more frequently than this can,  under monogamous conditions be indulged, is also easy to understand.    8. _How frequently may sexual intercourse be indulged, in the marriage  state?_    If one is to overstep the bounds mentioned above, i.e., to indulge in  sexual intercourse once or twice in a month for procreation only and  not at all during the period of pregnancy and childbed period, the  limit is then set, not by strictly normal and anthropological  considerations, but by the health of the individuals. The author has  seen young married couples who had carried their sexual intercourse to  such extremes as seriously to deplete the physical vigor and menace  the health of both parties. Just how frequent indulgence will have  this effect in any particular case is impossible to say. In some cases  twice a week may have this effect; in other cases once in twenty-four  hours might be borne for a considerable time. In any case the  condition is an unnatural one and is certain to bring a natural  retribution in some form--either broken health, or sterility of the  wife, and depleted powers of the husband, or weak and sickly children,  separated by long intervals.    9. _How long is it possible for a young man to waste his vital fluid  and yet be able to raise healthy children?_    This question cannot be answered in other than most general terms. The  author has known one case of a young man who, for several years,  practiced masturbation several times a day, so far depleting his  powers that he could not walk erect, his muscles were flabby, his  testes were very soft and small, his eyes shifty, his hands clammy and  his mind incoherent in its working. He seemed to be a candidate for  the asylum and would probably have gone there if radical means had not  been adopted to break him of the habit. He was broken, however,  absolutely, and never performed the act after his nineteenth birthday.  Within three years he had completely recovered his virility. He had  nearly doubled in weight and in lung capacity and a large part of his  increased weight was in great bulk of muscle of high tonicity--muscle  which he had gained by heavy physical work upon a ranch. His sexual  organs had completely regained their tonicity and without doubt, their  virility. He had so far recovered mentally that he finished a course  of professional study and entered with great success upon the practice  of his chosen profession.    On the other hand, a middle-aged man consulted the author regarding  the sterility of his wife. After examination, it was found that the  husband had practiced masturbation about twice a week from the age of  puberty to his twenty-fourth year, when he was married. He assured the  author that at the time of his marriage his testicles were, as far as  he had known, similar to the testicles of other young men, and that  during his married life he had never had intercourse with his wife  more frequently than once in a month, but that during that time he had  noticed a gradual atrophy of the testes. At the time of the  examination only small atrophied remains of these testes could be  discovered. The sterility of the wife was due, without any question,  to the absolute impotence of the husband, and so far as the history of  the case would suggest, there was no other assignable cause of this  impotence than the eight years of masturbation.    From these two cases, it must be evident that no rules can be laid  down. In one case the subject recovered fully from a case of extreme  masturbation; in the other-case, a habit that would not be called  extreme resulted in impotence. It must be evident that the practice is  a dangerous one after puberty, as no individual can tell to which of  the above cases his may be similar.    10. _Granting that masturbation is harmful through loss of semen, is  there any compensation for this loss of semen in case of intercourse  with a woman?_    There is no doubt that an emission of semen following sexual  excitement is a draught upon the virile powers of the male animal. If  this sexual excitement is the artificial one cultivated by the  masturbator, the depletion seems to be more marked than is the case  with the normal, natural stimulation incident to sexual intercourse.  Some have suggested that the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24717"],[0,"Danger! A True History of a Great City's Wiles and Temptations (#17)"],[1,"was observed by her  daughter purloining the ear-rings from her boudoir drawer on the day in  question, and that immediately she was informed of the larceny she had  sought out Hemmings and ascertained that he had fled to Pittsburgh. On  inquiry, she had also traced the missing jewelry to a pawn-office kept  by Mr. Barnard, at No. 404 Third avenue, where the articles were pledged  by Hemmings. She also went to Pittsburg with Detective Young, and the  pawn-ticket of the ear-rings was found on Hemmings, which she took from  him. Mrs. Bethune further stated that the officer then handcuffed the  prisoner and brought him on to this city.    The witness was then subjected to a rigid cross-examination by Mr. Howe,  who propounded questions as follows:    Mr. Howe: Are you married to Mr. Bethune?    Mrs. Bethune (imploringly to Judge Russel): Am I compelled to answer  that question?    Judge Russel: Mr. Howe, I have already ruled that these kind of  questions are improper.    Mr. Howe (with pertinacity): Your honor, I desire to show that this  witness is not the wife of Mr. Bethune; and I contend that, in justice  to my client, the question should be answered.    Judge Russel: I rule it out.    Mr. Howe: I take exception to the ruling of the court, and will now put  another question, namely:    Is Mr. Bethune your husband? (Sensation in court.)    Judge Russel ruled the question inadmissible, and exception was taken.    Detective John Young, of the Eighteenth Precinct Police, was next  called, and deposed: I am connected with the Metropolitan Police of this  city; I was sent with a requisition issued by Governor Fenton to  Pittsburgh to arrest George Hemmings for grand larceny; I went there  with Mr. and Mrs. Bethune; I took Hemmings into custody at the  Pittsburgh Theatre; he made a violent resistance, and scuffled with me;  I was necessitated to handcuff him in the cars; he became very abusive  and threatening; in fact, so much so, that I was compelled to hit him on  the head with the butt-end of my pistol; at the time of his arrest he  had upon him the ticket of the ear-rings.    Alexander Barnard, a pawnbroker at No. 404 Third avenue, was the next  witness, and said: I know the prisoner at the bar; he pledged me with  two diamond ear-rings on the 20th of last October, which Mr. Lynch  subsequently identified as his property.    Cross-examined by Mr. Howe: Hemmings has frequently pawned articles of  jewelry with me; he pledged them in the name of Mrs. Bethune.    Mr. Howe here requested that the pawnbroker should be directed to  produce his book in order that the jury might see the dates, the  production of which the counsel insisted would entirely contradict Mrs.  Bethune's testimony.    The book was subsequently produced, and Mr. Barnard testified, on  further cross-examination by Mr. Howe, that Hemmings had pledged with  him a watch belonging to Mrs. Bethune on the 17th of November, being  _nearly one month_ after the date the ear-rings were pledged.    Mrs. Lynch proved that the ear-rings were her property, and that she had  loaned them to Mrs. Bethune.    Mrs. Bethune now took the witness stand, and she was asked by Mr. Howe  how long she had known Hemmings, the prisoner at the bar?    Mrs. Bethune: About twelve years.    Mr. Howe: Where did you first become acquainted with him?    Mrs. Bethune: At Philadelphia; I was employed in the United States Mint,  and we boarded together in the same house.    Mr. Howe: Did you subsequently come on to New York with him?    Witness (hesitatingly): I did.    Mr. Howe: Were you on terms of peculiar intimacy with him?    Mrs. Bethune: I was not (sensation in the court): we were friends.    Mr. Howe: Was it not at your solicitation that he was taken to live in  the same house with yourself and Mr. Bethune?    Mrs. Bethune: Yes, it was; but I merely took him in out of charity, as  he was poor and had no clothes (sensation in court).    Mr. Howe: Did you ever stay at the Washington Hotel in this city with  him?    Judge Russel here interposed, and informed Mrs. Bethune that she need  not answer that question.    Mr. Howe: Did you not visit him when he was employed at A. T. Stewart's  store in this city?    Mrs. Bethune: I did; but I got him employed there.    Mr. Howe (aside): Compassionate woman (laughter). Now, Mrs. Bethune,  through whom did you get him employed at that store?    Mrs. Bethune: Through Mr. Griswold, a gentleman of my acquaintance.    Mr. Howe: Did you not know at the time you had Hemmings in your house  that he was a married man?    Mrs. Bethune: I did. (Sensation.)    Mr. Howe: Have you not been to the Whitney House with Hemmings?    The court also decided that witness need not answer that question,  whereupon counsel took exception.    Mr. Howe: Have you not frequently been to the Chanler House in this city  with Mr. Hemmings?    Question overruled.    Mr. Howe: Did you not receive visits from Hemmings in East Fourth  street, in this city?    Mrs. Bethune: Am I bound to answer that question?    Judge Russel: I overrule that question, and you need not answer it.    Mr. Howe: Did you ever live in a house in Lombard street, Philadelphia,  kept by a Miss Graham, and did you ever meet Hemmings there.    Mrs. Bethune (indignantly): I did not.    Mr. Howe: Did you ever introduce Hemmings to any person at Saratoga as  your brother?    Mrs. Bethune (reluctantly): Yes, I have. (Sensation.)    Mr. Howe: How many times have you given Hemmings your jewelry to pledge  that he might have money?    Mrs. Bethune: I never gave him permission to pledge any of my jewelry.    Mr. Howe: Do you mean to swear that he has never pledged any of your  jewelry prior to the present occasion?    Mrs. Bethune: Yes, he has, but not with my consent. (Sensation.)    Mr. Howe: Was that whilst he was living in your house?    Mrs. Bethune: It was.    Mr. Howe: Why did you not have him arrested for so doing?    Mrs. Bethune: Because he cried, and I forgave him. (Sensation.)    Mr. Howe: Yes, you forgave your \"BROTHER\" (roars of laughter). Now,  madam! will you swear that you did not give Hemmings your watch to  pledge on the 17th of November last, nearly one month after he pledged  the ear-rings?    Mrs. Bethune: I did not; I will swear that I never gave him anything to  pledge after he pawned the ear-rings; I did not give him the ear-rings;  I paid Kate Fisher the money with which to open the theatre, and not to  Hemmings; I did not pay her in the Chanler House, in Hemmings' presence;  I paid her on the street, the reason Hemmings went to Saratoga with me,  was to take care of Mr. Bethune's horses (immoderate laughter); I will  swear that I had not seen Hemmings since he took the ear-rings until I  had him arrested; I did not arrest him right away, because I was sick;  the ear-rings were not mine, they belonged to Mr. Lynch; I borrowed them  from Mrs. Lynch.    Mr. Howe: What was your name when you became acquainted with Hemmings?    Mrs. Bethune: Eliza Garrett.    This closed the case for the prosecution, and Mr. Howe, for the defense,  called Dr. J. Kennedy, who testified as follows:    I am a physician, and reside in East Tenth street in this city; I have  seen the prisoner before. In October last, I saw him in a house in East  Fourth street.    Mr. Howe: What were you doing at that house?    Dr. Kennedy: I was attending a lady there, professionally.    Mr. Howe: Would you know that lady again?  Dr. Kennedy: I should.  Mr. Howe (to Mrs. Bethune): Madam, will you oblige me by standing up and  raising your veil?    The lady complied with Mr. Howe's request, and amidst breathless silence  Mr. Howe, addressing Dr. Kennedy, said, \"Doctor, is that the lady?\"    Dr. Kennedy: It is. (Flutter in the court-room.)    Mr. Howe: How many times did you visit her?    Dr. Kennedy: Eight or ten times.    Mr. Howe: Was Hemmings in the room with her?    Dr. Kennedy: He was. (Sensation.)    Mr. Howe then applied for attachments against two witnesses who had been  subpoenaed to prove that Mrs. Bethune had been at the Whitney House and  the Washington Hotel with Hemmings, but Judge Russel declined to grant  any time, and peremptorily ordered Mr. Howe to proceed with his defense  to the jury.    Mr. Howe then arose and addressed the court. He said:    Gentlemen of the Jury: I approach the consideration of this case with  some degree of embarrassment, which is necessarily forced upon me, from  the fact, that whilst discharging, as I shall endeavor to do, to the  best of my ability, my duties as an advocate to the young man accused of  this larceny, I regret that I am called upon to animadvert in terms of  censure and reproach, upon one who leaves a name which is dear and  hallowed to us all--the originator of our being--a name that we all  revere and respect when we view it in the beauteous and lovely purity  which is thrown around it. But I think, gentlemen, it is not unfair when  that name is divested of its purity, and becomes shrouded with that  which is base and vile--when the guard which we naturally and  intuitively throw around it is dispelled, and, instead of the beauteous  statue of monumental alabaster, we see a black, foetid, loathsome thing  before us, from which we shrink with indignation and horror, knowing it  is that which drags our young men down to degradation, disgrace and  death--I say, in entering upon this prisoner's defense, such is the  distinction between pure and hallowed and virtuous women (against whom  none dare point) and her who forgets herself--forgets the holy ties due  to her sex, and her own self-respect: and who assumes the place of wife  to a man without that sanction which God has instituted and commanded,  and who, entrapping others, comes to court to-day--not the pure being to  demand your respect--but one whom we can but contemplate with loathing  and disgust, and who has proved herself utterly unworthy of belief.  Gentlemen, I simply wish to direct your attention"]]]
