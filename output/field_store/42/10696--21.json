Mr. Williams said:    I prepared the original bill in this case, which contains in different  words the exception contained in the amendment reported by the  Committee. I do not regard the exception as of any real practical  consequence, because I suppose if the President and any head of a  Department should disagree so as to make their relations unpleasant,  and the President should signify a desire that the head of a Department  retire from the Cabinet, THAT WOULD FOLLOW WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE ACT OF  REMOVAL ON THE PART OF THE PRESIDENT.    Mr. Fessenden said:    The Constitution imposes upon the President of the United States the  duty of executing the laws; it does not impose that duty upon the  Secretaries. They are creatures of the law and not of the Constitution  directly. Some, and perhaps the greater part, of their functions are as  advisers of the President and to aid him in executing the laws in  their several Departments. There are some duties that are specifically  conferred upon them by Congress. Their relation to the President, as has  been well said by gentlemen, is that mostly of confidential advisers.  With the exception of the particular duties imposed upon them by law,  and on the Secretary of the Treasury more than on the others, they  do nothing of their own motion, but act by order of the President in  discharging the particular duties of their office. * * * That being the  peculiar condition of affairs it has always been considered since  the foundation of the Government, as a matter of course, as a general  rule--there may have been one or two exceptions, and I think there have  been, but I am not very positive on that point--that the President  might select such persons as he pleased to be members of his Cabinet. Of  course the confirmation of the Senate is necessary; but the general idea  of the Senate has been, whether they liked the men or not, to confirm  them without any difficulty, because in executing the great and varied  interests of this great country it is exceedingly important that there  should be the utmost harmony between those who are charged with that  execution.    The bill passed as reported and went to the House. That body amended it  by making Cabinet officers non-removable by the President without the  consent of the Senate, and sent the bill back to the Senate, when Mr.  Sherman said:    It (the Tenure-of-Office bill) ought to have been passed, and probably  would have been passed, long ago, if a different condition of affairs  had existed before. But when you propose to extend that principle  to Cabinet officers, a very different state of affairs arises, and  different circumstances apply to this subject. Now I say, that if a  Cabinet officer should attempt to hold his office for a moment beyond  the time when he retained the entire confidence of the President, I  would not vote to retain him, NOR WOULD I COMPEL THE PRESIDENT TO LEAVE  ABOUT HIM IN THESE HIGH POSITIONS A MAN IN WHOM HE DID NOT ENTIRELY  TRUST, both personally and politically. It would be unwise to require  him to administer the Government without agents of his own choosing.  It seems to me, therefore, that it would be unwise for the Senate to  engraft in this bill a provision that would enable a Cabinet officer  to hold on to his office in violation of the will of his Chief. * *  * Suppose the personal relations between a Cabinet officer and the  President became so unpleasant that they could have no personal  intercourse. The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Howe), says in such a case  the Cabinet officer would resign. Suppose he should hold on to his  power and position--what then? There is no power to remove him, and  the President can have no intercourse with him. Would you compel such a  state of affairs? It seems to me that it would be unwise to do so. That  the Senate had no such purpose is shown by its vote twice to make this  exception. That this provision does not apply to the present case, is  shown by the fact that its language is so framed as NOT TO APPLY TO THE  PRESENT PRESIDENT. * * * It would not prevent the present President from  removing the present Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, or the  Secretary of State.    A considerable number of Senators participated in the debate, which  was able and exhaustive to an exceptional degree, on both sides, and  occupied several days in the various stages of the proceeding.    Mr. Edmunds closed the debate in the Senate with the following remarks:    I do not rise to prolong the debate, but only to express the hope that  the debate on this question may terminate--that we may come to a vote.  * * * While I should be glad to occupy some time in reply to some things  that have fallen in the course of this debate, I feel it to be due to  the business of the Senate to abstain. I hope the Senate will disagree  to this amendment, (made by the House) and adhere to the bill as it  stands.    The vote was then taken, and resulted in 17 for agreeing to the House  amendment, and 28 against it.    The action of the Senate was reported to the House and Conference  Committees were appointed by the two houses.    On the 18th of February, the following substitute for the first section  of the bill was reported by the Committee of Conference and adopted by  both Houses, and the bill went to the President:    Provided, That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, of  the Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmaster General and the Attorney  General, shall hold their offices respectively FOR AND DURING THE TERMS  OF THE PRESIDENT BY WHOM THEY MAY HAVE BEEN APPOINTED, and for one month  thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and consent of the  Senate.    On Monday, March 2nd, 1867, the President returned the bill to the  Senate, in which house it had originated, with his objections thereto,  as follows:    To the Senate of the United States:    I have carefully examined the bill to regulate the tenure of certain  civil offices. The material portion of the bill is contained in the  first section, and is of the effect following, namely:    \"That every person holding any civil office to which he has been  appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and every  person who shall hereafter be appointed to any such office, and shall  become duly qualified to act therein, is and shall be entitled to  hold such office until a successor shall have been appointed by  the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and duly  qualified; and that the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of  War, of the Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmaster General, and the  Attorney General, shall hold their offices respectively for and during  the term of the President by whom they may have been appointed, and  for one month thereafter, subject to removal by and with the advice and  consent of the Senate.\"    These revisions are qualified by a reservation in the fourth section,  \"that nothing contained in the bill shall be construed to extend the  term of any office the duration of which is limited by law.\" In effect  the bill provides that the President shall not remove from their places  any of the civil officers whose terms of service are not limited by law  without the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States. The  bill, in this respect, conflicts, in my judgment, with the Constitution  of the United States. The question, as Congress is well aware, is by no  means a new one. That the power of removal is constitutionally vested  in the President of the United States is a principle which has been not  more distinctly declared by judicial authority and judicial commentators  than it has been uniformly practiced upon by the legislative and  executive departments of the Government. The question arose in the House  of Representatives so early as the 16th day of June, 1789, on the bill  for establishing an executive department, denominated \"The Department of  Foreign Affairs.\" The first clause of the bill, after recapitulating the  functions of that officer and defining his duties, had these words: \"To  be removable from office by the President of the United States.\" It was  moved to strike out these words, and the motion was sustained with  great ability and vigor. It was insisted that the President could not  constitutionally exercise the power of removal exclusive of the Senate;  that the Federalist so interpreted the Constitution when arguing for its  adoption by the several States; that the Constitution had nowhere  given the President power of removal, either expressly or by strong  implication; but on the contrary, had distinctly provided for removals  from office by impeachment only. A construction which denied the power  of removal by the President was further maintained by arguments drawn  from the danger of the abuse of the power; from the supposed tendency  of an exposure of public officers to capricious removal; to impair the  efficiency of the civil service; from the alleged injustice and hardship  of displacing incumbents, dependent upon their official stations,  without sufficient consideration; from a supposed want of responsibility  on the part the President, and from an imagined defect of guarantees  against a vicious President, who might incline to abuse the power.    On the other hand, an exclusive power of removal by the President was  defended as a true exposition of the text of the Constitution."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#17)"],[1,"stitions, he told me that he saw the devil, in all  his hideousness, on the road, just before dark, near his farm, a little  north of Palmyra. You can see that Harris was a fit subject to carry out  the scheme of organizing a new religion.    \"The absolute secrecy of the whole inception and publication of the  Mormon Bible stopped positive knowledge. We only knew what Joseph Smith  would permit Martin Harris to publish, in reference to the whole thing.    \"The issuing of the Book of Mormon scarcely made a ripple of excitement  in Palmyra.    \"ALBERT CHANDLER.\"*         * Mr. Chandler moved to Michigan in 1835, and has been connected  with several newspapers in that state, editing the Kalamazoo Gazette,  and founding and publishing the Coldwater Sentinel. He was elected  the first mayor of Coldwater, serving several terms. He was in his  eighty-fifth year when the above letter was written.      The book was published early in 1830. On paper the sale of the first  edition showed a profit of $3250 at $1.25 a volume, that being the  lowest price to be asked on pain of death, according to a \"special  revelation\" received by Smith. By the original agreement Harris was to  have the exclusive control of the sale of the book. But it did not sell.  The local community took it no more seriously than they did Joe himself  and his family. The printer demanded his pay as the work progressed,  and it became necessary for Smith to spur Harris on by announcing a  revelation (Sec. 19, \"Doctrine and Covenants\"), saying, \"I command thee  that thou shalt not covet thine own property, but impart it freely to  the printing of the Book of Mormon.\" Harris accordingly disposed of his  share of the farm and paid Grandin.    To make the book \"go,\" Smith now received a revelation which permitted  his father, soon to be elevated to the title of Patriarch, to sell it on  commission, and Smith, Sr., made expeditions through the country, taking  in pay for any copies sold such farm produce or \"store goods\" as he  could use in his own family. How much he \"cut\" the revealed price of the  book in these trades is not known, but in one instance, when arrested in  Palmyra for a debt of $5.63, he, under pledge of secrecy, offered seven  of the Bibles in settlement, and the creditor, knowing that the old man  had no better assets, accepted the offer as a joke.*         * \"Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism,\" Tucker, p. 63.        CHAPTER VII. -- THE SPAULDING MANUSCRIPT    The history of the Mormon Bible has been brought uninterruptedly to this  point in order that the reader may be able to follow clearly each  step that had led up to its publication. It is now necessary to give  attention to two subjects intimately connected with the origin of this  book, viz., the use made of what is known as the \"Spaulding manuscript,\"  in supplying the historical part of the work, and Sidney Rigdon's share  in its production.    The most careful student of the career of Joseph Smith, Jr., and of his  family and his associates, up to the year 1827, will fail to find any  ground for the belief that he alone, or simply with their assistance,  was capable of composing the Book of Mormon, crude in every sense as  that work is. We must therefore accept, as do the Mormons, the statement  that the text was divinely revealed to Smith, or must look for some  directing hand behind the scene, which supplied the historical part and  applied the theological. The \"Spaulding manuscript\" is believed to have  furnished the basis of the historical part of the work.    Solomon Spaulding, born in Ashford, Connecticut, in 1761, was graduated  from Dartmouth College in 1785, studied divinity, and for some years  had charge of a church. His own family described him as a peculiar  man, given to historical researches, and evidently of rather unstable  disposition. He gave up preaching, conducted an academy at Cherry  Valley, New York, and later moved to Conneaut, Ohio, where in 1812 he  had an interest in an iron foundry. His attention was there attracted to  the ancient mounds in that vicinity, and he set some of his men to work  exploring one of them. \"I vividly remember how excited he became,\"  says his daughter, when he heard that they had exhumed some human  bones, portions of gigantic skeletons, and various relics. From these  discoveries he got the idea of writing a fanciful history of the ancient  races of this country.    The title he chose for his book was \"The Manuscript Found.\" He  considered this work a great literary production, counted on being able  to pay his debts from the proceeds of its sale, and was accustomed to  read selections from the manuscript to his neighbors with evident pride.  The impression that such a production would be likely to make on the  author's neighbors in that frontier region and in those early days, when  books were scarce and authors almost unknown, can with difficulty be  realized now. Barrett Wendell, speaking of the days of Bryant's early  work, says:--    \"Ours was a new country...deeply and sensitively aware that it lacked a  literature. Whoever produced writings which could be pronounced adorable  was accordingly regarded by his fellow citizens as a public benefactor,  a great public figure, a personage of whom the nation could be proud.\"*  This feeling lends weight to the testimony of Mr. Spaulding's neighbors,  who in later years gave outlines of his work.         * \"Literary History of America.\"      In order to find a publisher Mr. Spaulding moved with his family to  Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. A printer named Patterson spoke well of the  manuscript to its author, but no one was found willing to publish  it. The Spauldings afterward moved to Amity, Pennsylvania, where Mr.  Spaulding died in 1816. His widow and only child went to live with Mrs.  Spaulding's brother, W. H. Sabine, at Onondaga Valley, New York, taking  their effects with them. These included an old trunk containing Mr.  Spaulding's papers. \"There were sermons and other papers,\" says his  daughter, \"and I saw a manuscript about an inch thick, closely written,  tied up with some stories my father had written for me, one of which he  called 'The Frogs of Windham.' On the outside of this manuscript were  written the words 'Manuscript Found.' I did not read it, but looked  through it, and had it in my hands many times, and saw the names I  had heard at Conneaut, when my father read it to his friends.\" Mrs.  Spaulding next went to her father's house in Connecticut, leaving her  personal property at her brother's. She married a Mr. Davison in 1820,  and the old trunk was sent to her at her new home in Hartwick, Otsego  County, New York. The daughter was married to a Mr. McKinstry in  1828, and her mother afterward made her home with her at Monson,  Massachusetts, most of the time until her death in 1844.    When the newly announced Mormon Bible began to be talked about in Ohio,  there were immediate declarations in Spaulding's old neighborhood of a  striking similarity between the Bible story and the story that Spaulding  used to read to his acquaintances there, and these became positive  assertions after the Mormons had held a meeting at Conneaut. The opinion  was confidently expressed there that, if the manuscript could be found  and published, it would put an end to the Mormon pretence.    About the year 1834 Mrs. Davison received a visit at Monson from D.  P. Hurlbut, a man who had gone over to the Mormons from the Methodist  church, and had apostatized and been expelled. He represented that he  had been sent by a committee to secure \"The Manuscript Found\" in order  that it might be compared with the Mormon Bible. As he brought a letter  from her brother, Mrs. Davison, with considerable reluctance, gave him  an introduction to George Clark, in whose house at Hartwick she had left  the old trunk, directing Mr. Clark to let Hurlbut have the manuscript,  receiving his verbal pledge to return it. He obtained a manuscript from  this trunk, but did not keep his pledge.*         * Condensed from an affidavit by Mrs. McKinstry, dated April 3,  1880, in Scribner's Magazine for August, 1880.      The Boston Recorder published in May, 1839, a detailed statement by Mrs.  Davison concerning her knowledge of \"The Manuscript Found.\" After giving  an account of the writing of the story, her statement continued as  follows:--    \"Here [in Pittsburg] Mr. Spaulding found a friend and acquaintance in  the person of Mr. Patterson, who was very much pleased with it, and  borrowed it for perusal. He retained it for a long time, and informed  Mr. Spaulding that, if he would make out a title-page and preface, he  would publish it, as it might be a source of profit. This Mr. Spaulding  refused to do. Sidney Rigdon, who has figured so largely in the history  of the Mormons, was at that time connected with the printing office of  Mr. Patterson, as is well known in that region, and, as Rigdon himself  has frequently stated, became acquainted with Mr. Spaulding's manuscript  and copied it. It was a matter of notoriety and interest to all  connected with the printing establishment. At length the manuscript was  returned to its author, and soon after we removed to Amity where Mr.  Spaulding deceased in 1816. The manuscript then fell into my hands, and  was carefully preserved.\"    This statement stirred up the Mormons greatly, and they at once  pronounced the letter a forgery, securing from Mrs. Davison a statement  in which she said that she did not write it. This was met with a counter  statement by the Rev. D. R. Austin that it was made up from notes of  a conversation with her, and was correct. In confirmation of this  the Quincy [Massachusetts] Whig printed a letter from John Haven of  Holliston, Massachusetts, giving a report of a conversation between his  son Jesse and Mrs. Davison concerning this letter, in which she stated  that the letter was substantially correct, and that some of the names "]]]
