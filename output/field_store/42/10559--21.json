Then she once more cried out:    \"Sister Ann, do you see anyone coming?\"    \"I see,\" said her sister, \"a cloud of dust a little to the left.\"    \"Do you think it is my brothers?\" continued the wife.    \"Alas, no, dear sister,\" replied she, \"it is only a flock of sheep!\"    \"Will you come down or not, madam?\" said Blue Beard, in the greatest  rage imaginable.    [Illustration]    \"Only one moment more,\" answered she. And then she called out for the  last time:    \"Sister Ann! do you see no one coming?\"    \"I see,\" replied her sister, \"two men on horseback coming to the house;  but they are still at a great distance.\"    \"God be praised!\" cried she; \"it is my brothers. Give them a sign to  make what haste they can.\"    At the same moment Blue Beard cried out so loud for her to come down,  that his voice shook the whole house. The poor lady, with her hair  loose and her eyes swimming in tears, came down, and fell on her knees  before Blue Beard, and was going to beg him to spare her life, but he  interrupted her, saying: \"All this is of no use, for you shall die;\"  then, seizing her with one hand by the hair, and raising the simitar he  held in the other, he was going with one blow to strike off her head.    The unfortunate woman, turning toward him, desired to have a single  moment allowed her to compose herself.    \"No, no,\" said Blue Beard; \"I will give you no more time, I am  determined. You have had too much already.\"    Again he raised his arm. Just at this instant a loud knocking was  heard at the gates, which made Blue Beard wait for a moment to see  who it was. The gates were opened, and two officers entered with  their swords in their hands. Blue Beard, seeing they were his wife's  brothers, endeavored to escape, but they pursued and seized him  before he had got twenty steps, and, plunging their swords into  his body, laid him dead at their feet.    The poor wife, who was almost as dead as her husband, was unable at  first to rise and embrace her brothers, but she soon recovered.    As Blue Beard had no heirs, she found herself the possessor of his great  riches. She used part of her vast fortune in giving a marriage dowry to  her sister Ann, who soon after was married. With another part she bought  captains' commissions for her two brothers; and the rest she presented  to a most worthy gentleman whom she married soon after, and whose kind  treatment soon made her forget Blue Beard's cruelty.          LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD    [Illustration]      Once upon a time there lived a little girl, who was so sweet and pretty  and good that everybody loved her. Her old grandmother, who was very  fond of her, made her a little red cloak and hood, which suited her so  well that everyone called her \"Little Red Riding-Hood.\"    One day, Little Red Riding-Hood's mother told her to take a basket with  some butter and eggs and fresh-baked cake to her grandmother, who was  ill. The little girl, who was always willing and obliging, ran at once  to fetch her red cloak, and, taking her basket, set out on her journey.    On her way she met a wolf, who wished very much to eat her up; but who  dared not do so because some wood-cutters were working close by. So he  only said:    \"Good-morning, Little Red Riding-Hood; where are you off to so early?\"    Little Red Riding-Hood, who did not know how dangerous it was to talk to  a wolf, replied:    \"I am going to see my grandmother, who is ill in bed, to take her some  butter and eggs and a fresh-baked cake that my mother has made for her!\"    \"Where does your grandmother live?\" asked the wolf.    \"In the little white cottage at the other side of the wood,\" answered  Red Riding-Hood.    \"Well,\" said the wolf, \"I am going that way, too. If you will let me, I  will walk part of the way with you.\" So Little Red Riding-Hood, who  suspected no harm, set off with the wolf for her companion.    Presently Red Riding-Hood stopped to gather a nosegay of wild flowers  for her grandmother, and the wolf, who had thought of a plan to get the  little girl for his dinner, said \"Good morning,\" and trotted away.    [Illustration]    As soon as he was out of sight, he began to run as fast as he could. In  a short time he reached the grandmother's cottage and knocked at the  door.    \"Who is there?\" asked the old grandmother, as she lay in bed.    \"It is Little Red Riding-Hood,\" answered the wolf. \"I have brought you  some butter and eggs and a fresh-baked cake which mother has made for  you.\"    \"Pull the bobbin and the latch will go up,\" said the old grandmother. So  the wolf pulled the bobbin and opened the door, and sprang upon the poor  old grandmother and ate her all up in a twinkling.    Then he put on her night-cap and got into bed, and lay down to wait for  Red Riding-Hood.    Very soon there came a little soft tap at the door.    \"Who is there?\" called out the wolf.    \"It is Little Red Riding-Hood, grandmother dear. I have brought you some  butter and eggs and a fresh-baked cake which mother has made for you.\"    Then the wolf called out, disguising his voice as much as he could:    \"Pull the bobbin and the latch will go up.\" So Little Red Riding-Hood  pulled the bobbin and went inside.    [Illustration]    \"Good morning, dear grandmother,\" she said. \"How are you feeling today?\"    \"Very bad indeed, my dear,\" answered the wolf, trying to hide himself  under the bedclothes.    \"How strange and hoarse your voice sounds, grandmother,\" said the little  girl.    \"I have got a bad cold, my dear,\" said the wicked wolf.    \"Grandmother, what very bright eyes you have!\" went on Red Riding-Hood,  surprised to see how strange her grandmother looked in her nightclothes.    \"The better to see you with, my dear,\" said the wolf.    \"Grandmother, what very big ears you have!\"    \"The better to hear you with, my child.\"    \"Grandmother, what very long arms you have!\"    \"The better to hug you with, my dear.\"    \"But, grandmother, what great big teeth you have,\" said Red Riding-Hood,  who was beginning to get frightened.    \"The better to eat you with,\" roared the wolf, suddenly jumping out of  bed. He seized hold of poor Little Red Riding-Hood, and was just about  to eat her up, when there was a great noise outside, and the door burst  open and in rushed the wood-cutters, who had seen the wolf talking to  the little girl in the wood, and came to see what mischief he was up to.    They killed the wicked wolf quite dead; and so Little Red Riding-Hood  was saved, and ran home to tell her mother all about her terrible  adventure.    [Illustration]          SINDBAD THE SAILOR    [Illustration]      Sindbad the sailor, after all his adventures and wanderings, settled  down in happiness and prosperity in Bagdad. Here are the stories which  he told to his friends of his seven marvelous voyages.      THE FIRST VOYAGE    My father died while I was young and left me a fortune. Having no one to  restrain me, I fell into bad ways, by which I not only wasted my time,  but injured my health, and destroyed my property.    When I recovered, I collected together what was left of my fortune, and  bought merchandise, which I loaded on board a vessel for the port of  Balsora.    [Illustration]    During the voyage we touched at several islands, where we sold or  exchanged our goods. We were one day becalmed near a small island. As  its appearance was inviting, we determined to dine upon it. But while we  were laughing and preparing for dinner, the island began to move, and at  the same moment the people in the ship called out that we were on the  back of a monstrous whale. Some jumped into the boat, and others swam to  the ship; but before I could get off the animal dived into the sea, and  I had only time to catch hold of a piece of wood that had been brought  from the ship to serve as a table. Upon this piece of timber I was  carried away by the current. The others reached the vessel, but a gale  sprang up and the ship sailed without me. I floated during that and the  next night, but the following morning was thrown on a small island.    I found fresh water and fruit. I looked about for some house, but found  none. There were a number of colts grazing together, but no traces of  other animals. When evening approached I took some more fruit and  climbed in a tree to sleep. About midnight the sound of trumpets and  drums seemed to pass around the island, which continued until morning,  when again it seemed to be uninhabited. On the next day I found that the  island was small, and that no other land was in sight. I therefore gave  myself up as lost. Nor were my fears lessened when I found that the  shore abounded with enormous serpents and other sea monsters. I found,  however, that they were timid, and that the rattling of sticks would  make them dive into the water.    [Illustration: _Sindbad the Sailor_  We Rowed as Fast as we Could]    I climbed the tree next night, and the drums and trumpets returned as  before. On the third day, I had the satisfaction of seeing a body of  men, who, on landing, were astonished to see me there. Having related  to them how I came hither, they told me they were grooms of King  Mihrage; that the island belonged to genii, who visited it every night  with drums and trumpets; that the genii had allowed their sovereign to  train his colts upon the island; and that they, being sent every six  months to select some, had arrived for that purpose.    The grooms carried me to King Mihrage, who allowed me apartments in his  palace.

The number of vertebrae composing the vertebral column  (exclusive of the cephalic) seemed to me a tolerably secure guide in the  determination of species,--being aware, however, that some doubted the  method, believing that the number of the vertebrae might vary, first,  with the individual, secondly with the age of the specimen. I still  continue to be of my original opinion, that the number of vertebrae  comprising the vertebral column, properly so called, may safely be  trusted in determining the species of the Cetacea; and with this view I  drew up the following Table, excepting from it the genus _Dugong_, which  I have never considered to be a Cetacean:--    _Tabular View of the Number of the Vertebrae in certain Cetacea._    (Cephalic vertebrae excluded.)    ---------------------------------------------------------------------  |                              Authorities.                         |  |                 ---------------------------------------------------  |  SPECIES.       |  CUVIER.

Van Beneden.  He praises, and deservedly, no doubt, the exertions of M. Eschricht to  collect a proper Museum of the Cetacea. It appears, according to M.  Eschricht, that at no age whatever do we find in true whales (meaning, I  presume, the _Mysticetus borealis_ and _australis_) any distinct  vertebrae in the cervical region as in other mammals. A fusion of all  into one bone or cartilage seems to take place even in the youngest  foetus. In the foetus examined by me of this species (a specimen removed  from the uterus of a true _Mysticetus_ killed in the Greenland seas), I  do not recollect the precise appearance of the cervical vertebrae; but  the skeleton is in existence, and shall be referred to. To the skeleton  of the Rorqual now in the Museum at Antwerp, and which seems to me of  the same species as the one I dissected in Scotland (and of which the  skeleton, prepared with infinite care by my brother and myself, was  presented by me to the Town Council of Edinburgh, and is now preserved  in the Zoological Gardens of the same city), he gives the following  vertebrae:--      Skeleton of the Rorqual at Antwerp--Cervical  7    Dorsal                                       14-15    Lumbar                                       15    Caudal                                       25[C]                                                 --------    Total                                        61 or 62    In the skeleton of the Great Rorqual now in the Zoological Gardens at  Edinburgh, and originally dissected and prepared by my brother and  myself, these vertebrae are--      Cervical             7    Dorsal              15    Lumbar and Caudal   43                        --    Total               65    In that of the Lesser Rorqual I dissected in 1830, the skeleton of which  I think is still preserved in the Museum of the University of Edinburgh,  we found--             Vertebrae.

I shall return to the Dugong, as not being a Cetacean, in a future  Section: its skeleton has been examined in a masterly way by De  Blainville, an anatomist and observer of the highest order, since the  time I wrote and published my Memoir on the Dugong.    The first great step in the anatomy of the Cetacea is unquestionably due  to Cuvier; but his dissections were almost confined to the genus  _Delphinus_, or the common Porpoise of our coasts. I repeated all his  dissections, and found them, as they almost always were, scrupulously  exact; but when I came to examine Cetacea with whalebone instead of  teeth, I was surprised to find how different, in fact, the anatomy of  the two great families was. Scarcely in any great natural family do we  find Cuvier's favourite theory of anatomical and physiological  co-relations so entirely at fault as in the Cetacea. The teeth or  whalebone, as natural-history characters, lead to no results; the whole  structure of the interior defies all _a-priori_ reasoning. The brain in  whalebone-whales does not fill the interior of the cranium; so that the  capacity of the one is no measure of the solid bulk of the other. Their  food is various, having no relation to the teeth or buccal appendages;  vascular structures surround the spinal marrow, and extend in the  _Balaenopterae_ into the cavity of the cranium, which"]]]
