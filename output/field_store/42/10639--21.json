How unable so small a companye of people, soe poorely sent over, were to  make way for such as shoulde followe, may easily be judged.    The first supplie beinge two shippes, the John & Francis & Phenix, with  one hundred & twenty persons, worse every way provided for then the  former, arrived heere about eight or nine months after & found the  Collony consistinge of no more then forty persons (of those) tenn only  able men, the rest at point of death, all utterly destitute of howses,  not one as yet built, so that they lodged in cabbins & holes within the  grounde; victualls they had none, save some small reliefe from the  Indians, as some yet living weare feelinge witnesses, neither were we  for our future and better maintenance permitted to manure or till any  grounde, a thing in a new Plantation principally to be regarded, but  weare by the direction of Sir Thomas Smith, and his officers heere,  wholly imployed in cuttinge downe of masts, cedar, blacke wallnutt,  clapboarde, &c., and in digginge gould oare (as some thought) which  beinge sent for England proved dirt. These works to make retorne of  present proffit hindered others of more necessary consequence of  Plantation.    After this first supplie there were some few poore howses built, &  entrance made in cleeringe of grounde to the quantitye of foure acres  for the wholl Collony, hunger & sickness not permitting any great  matters to bee donne that yeare.    The second supplie was a ship called the Mary Margett, which arrived  here nine months after, about the time of Michaellmas, in her sixty  persons, most gentlemen, few or no tradesmen, except some Polanders to  make Pitch, tarre, potashes, &c., to be retorned for present gaine, soe  meanly likewise were these furnished forth for victualles, that in lesse  then two monthes after their arrivall, want compelled us to imploye our  time abroad in trading with the Indians for corne; whereby though for a  time we partly relieved our necessities, yet in Maye followinge we weare  forced (leavinge a small guarde of gentlemen & some others about the  president at James Towne) to disperse the wholl Collony, some amongst  the Salvadges but most to the Oyster Banks, where they lived uppon  oysters for the space of nine weekes, with the allowance only of a pinte  of Indian corne to each man for a week, & that allowance of corne  continued to them but two weekes of the nine, which kinde of feeding  caused all our skinns to peele off, from head to foote, as if we had  beene flead. By this time arrived Captaine Samuell Argall in a small  Barque, with him neither supplie of men nor victualls from the Company;  but we understandinge that he had some small provisions of bread and  wine, more then would serve his owne companie, required him and the  master of the Barque to remaine ashoare whilst we might bring his sailes  ashoare the better to assure us of his ship & such provisions as coulde  be spared, whereunto he seemed willingly to condescend. Those  provisions, at a small allowance of Biskett, cake, and a small measure  of wine or beere to each person for a Daye some what relieved us for the  space of a month, at the end of which time arrived the thirde supplie,  called Sir Thomas Gates, his fleet, which consisted of seaven shippes &  neere five hundred persons with whom a small proportion of victuall, for  such a number, was landed; howses few or none to entertain them, so that  being quartered in the open feilde they fell uppon that small quantitye  of corne, not beinge above seaven acres, which we with great penury &  sufferance had formerly planted, and in three days, at the most, wholly  devoured it.    These numbers, thus meanly provided, not being able to subsist and live  together weare soone after devided into three parties and dispersed  abroad for their better reliefe. The first under commande of Captaine  Francis West to feat at the head of the River; a second under commande  of Captaine John Smith, then President, at James Towne, & the other,  with Capt. John Martin, in the River at Nansamun, which divisions gave  occasions to the Indiens treacherously to cutt off divers of our men &  boates, and forced the rest at the end of sixe weekes, havinge spent  those small provisions they had with them, to retire to James Town &  that in the depth of winter, when by reason of the colde, it was not  possible for us to endure to wade in the water (as formerly) to gather  oysters to satisfie our hungry stomacks, but constrained to digge in the  grounde for unwholesome rootes whereof we were not able to get so many  as would suffice us, in respect of the frost at that season & our  poverty & weakness, so that famine compelled us wholly to devoure those  Hogges, Dogges & horses that weare then in the Collony, together with  rates, mice, snakes, or what vermin or carryon soever we could light on,  as alsoe Toadstooles, Jewes eares, or what els we founde growing upon  the grounde that would fill either mouth or belly; and weare driven  through unsufferable hunger unnaturallie to eat those thinges which  nature most abhorred, the flesh and excrements of man, as well of our  owne nation as of an Indian, digged by some out of his grave after he  had laien buried three daies & wholly devoured him; others, envyinge the  better state of boddie of any whom hunger had not yet so much wasted as  there owne, lay waight and threatened to kill and eat them; one amonge  the rest slue his wife as she slept in his bosome, cutt her in peeces,  powdered her & fedd uppon her till he had clean devoured all partes  saveinge her heade, & was for soe barbarouse a fact and cruelty justly  executed. Some adventuringe to seeke releife in the woods, dyed as they  fought it, & weare eaten by others who found them dead. Many putt  themselves into the Indians' handes, though our enemies, and were by  them slaine. In this extremitye of famine continued the Collony till the  twenteth of Maye, when unexpected, yet happely, arrived Sir Thomas Gates  & Sir George Somers in two small Barques[FF] which they had built in the  Sommer Islands after the wreake of the Sea adventure wherin they sett  forth from Englande, with them one hundred persons barely provided of  vittel for themselves. They founde the Collony consistinge then of but  sixty persons most famished and at point of death, of whom many soone  after died; the lamentable outcries of theirs soe moved the hartes of  those worthies, not being in any sorte able long to releive their wantes  they soone resolved to imbarque themselves & this poore remainder of the  Collonye, in those two pinnaces & two other small Barques then in the  River, to sett saile for Newfoundland where they might releive their  wants & procure one safer passage for Englande. Every man, glad of this  resolution, laboured his uttmost to further it, so that in three weekes  we had fitted those barques and pinnaces (the best we could) & quitted  James Towne, leaving the poore buildings in it to the spoile of the  Indians, hopeinge never to retorne to re-possess them. When we had not  sailed downe the River above twelve miles but we espied a boat which  afterwards we understoode came from the right Honourable Lorde La Ware,  who was then arived at Point Comfort with three good shipps, wherin he  brought two hundred and fifty persons with some store of Provisions for  them; but by reason he founde the Collony in so great want was forced to  put both his owne people & the rest of the Collony to a very meane  allowance, which was seven pounde of English meale for a man a weeke, &  five pounds for every woman, without the addition of any victuall  whatsoever, except, in the stead of meale, we took valuablie either  pease or oatmeale. Uppon the arrival of that boat, Sir Thomas Gates  understandinge from the Lord La Ware, that his Lordship was arrived with  commission from the Company to be Gov^r & Capt. Gen^l of Virginia, & had  brought men & provisions for the subsistinge & advancing of the  Plantation, he the very next daye, to the great griefe of all his  Company (only except Capt. John Martin), as winde and weather gave  leave, retorned his whole company with charge to take possession againe  of those poore ruinated habitations at James Towne which he had formerly  abandoned; himselffe in a boate proceeded downeward to meete his  Lordship who, making all speede up, arrived shortly after at James  Towne. The time of the yeare being then most unseasonable, by  intemperate heat, at the end of June his people suddenly fallinge  generally into most pestilent diseases of Callentures and feavors, not  lesse then one hundred & fifty of them died within few moneths after, &  that chiefly for want of meanes to comfort them in their weak estates.  The residue alsoe disabled by reason of sicknes could performe nothing  that yeare to the advancement of the Collony, yet with the help of those  people which had arrived with Sir Thomas Gates, together with some of  the ancient Planters, who by use weare growen practique in a hard way of  livinge, two small forts weare erected neare the rivers mouth at  Kicoughtun, encompassed with small younge trees, haveinge for housing in  the one, two formerlie built by the Indians & covered with bark by them,  in the other a tent with some few thatcht cabbins which our people built  at our comming thether.
