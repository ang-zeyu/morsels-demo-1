The co-operation of Greece might still have been obtained if the Allies  could even then have sent to Salonica forces large enough to assure her  that the struggle would be waged on more equal terms.[3]  There had  always been an influential group among the principal military leaders  at Athens who held that it was to the vital interest of their country  that Bulgaria should be attacked, and who, to secure the help of the  Entente Powers against Bulgarian pretensions in the future, were  prepared to run great immediate risks.  As it was, the dilatoriness of  the Allies imposed upon M. Zaimis a policy of inaction.    This policy, besides being imposed by circumstances, also accorded with  the new Premier's character.    M. Zaimis stands out in the political world of Greece as a singular  anomaly: a politician who never made speeches and never gave  interviews: a silent man in a country where every citizen is a born  orator: an unambitious man in a country where ambition is an endemic  disease.  To find a parallel to his position, one must go back to the  days when nations, in need of wise guidance, implored reluctant sages  to undertake the task of guiding them.  This thankless task M. Zaimis  performed several times to everybody's temporary satisfaction.  On the  present, as on other occasions, he enjoyed the confidence of the  Entente Powers, {68} as well as the confidence of the King and the  people of Greece.  Even the journals of M. Venizelos, and the  Anglo-French Press which M. Venizelos inspired, paid the customary  tribute to M. Zaimis's integrity and sagacity.  The homage was due to  the fact that M. Zaimis was neither a Venizelist nor an  anti-Venizelist, but simply a Zaimist.  In domestic affairs he belonged  to no party; in foreign affairs to no school: he neither sought nor  shunned a change of course.    That explains why he succeeded in ruling Greece for four weeks, and  also why he failed to rule her longer.    M. Venizelos had not abandoned his standpoint.  Of M. Zaimis's person  he spoke with much respect; but of his policy he spoke just as one  might have expected M. Venizelos to speak: M. Zaimis had broken the  Servian Treaty and would go down to history as a man who had  dishonoured the signature of Greece.  With regard to the Entente  Powers, M. Venizelos thought that M. Zaimis meant honestly--the fact  that he was as well known to them as M. Venizelos himself, having  served as their High Commissioner in Crete for two years (1906-08),  exempted him from the imputation of duplicity--and since the Entente  Powers tolerated him, he would do likewise.  He only taunted the Zaimis  Government in Parliament for not obtaining for its policy a price from  those whom that policy unintentionally helped: Greece, to be sure, did  not remain neutral to serve Germany's but her own interests,  nevertheless, as Germany benefited by that neutrality, she should be  asked to give a _quid pro quo_.[4]    It was not the first time that M. Venizelos expressed this idea.  At  the Crown Council of 3 March he had suggested, if his own policy of  intervention was not adopted, to ask from Germany compensations for the  continuance of neutrality; and he urged that the King should personally  bargain with the Kaiser's Minister.  Again on 21 September, when  sounding the Entente Powers on the {69} possibility of sending troops  to Salonica, he advised the King simultaneously to sound the German  Emperor on the price of neutrality.[5]  King Constantine had always  shrunk from entering into any understanding whatever with Germany.  And, although the advice may have been given in good faith, it is easy  to guess the use to which its acceptance might be turned by M.  Venizelos, who, even as it was, did not hesitate to whisper of  \"pledges\" given to Germany.  So M. Zaimis endured the taunt and avoided  the trap.    This state of truce lasted for a month.  Then strife broke out afresh.  Early in November a member of the Government insulted the Opposition.  The Opposition demanded his dismissal.  This was refused and matters  were pushed to a crisis--whether by the adversaries of M. Venizelos,  anxious to get rid of a Chamber with a hostile majority, or by M.  Venizelos himself, anxious to get rid of a Cabinet that had succeeded  in establishing friendly relations with the Entente, it is impossible  to say.  Both conjectures found favour at the time, and both seem  probable.[6]  In any case, M. Venizelos made of that incident an  occasion for an attack on the Government's foreign policy, which,  ending in an adverse vote, led to the resignation of M. Zaimis and the  formation of a new Ministry under M. Skouloudis (7 November).    There ensued a dissolution of the Chamber (11 November) and a fresh  appeal to the people; the King, on the advice of M. Skouloudis,  inviting M. Venizelos to the polls, as who should say: When you got  your majority in June, the nation was with you; many things of the  gravest national concern have happened since; let us see if the nation  is with you now.  M. Venizelos declined the invitation: \"The  elections,\" he said, \"will be a farce.  All my supporters are detained  voteless under arms, and the only votes cast will be those of the older  and more timid men.\"  How many supporters he had under arms the near  future was to show.  Meanwhile, he and his partizans reinforced this  reason for abstention from the polls with other arguments.    {70} King Constantine, they alleged, was guilty of unconstitutional  behaviour.  He had twice disagreed with a Government supported by a  majority of the representatives of the people, and twice within a few  months had dissolved a Parliament duly chosen by the people.  Was such  a thing ever heard in a constitutional State?  The Constitution had  been violated: openly, insolently violated.    In Greece this cry has always been among the Opposition's common  stock-in-trade: it is enough for a Minister to misapply fifty drachmas  to acquire the title of a violator of the Constitution, and nobody ever  is the wiser or the worse for it.  M. Venizelos himself had often been  accused by his opponents of aiming at the subversion of Parliamentary  Government.  But in this instance the cry was destined to have, as we  shall see, epoch-making results, and for this reason it merits serious  examination.    The King's supporters denied that any violation of the Constitution had  taken place.  The Constitution of Greece, they pointed out, gives the  Crown explicitly the right to dismiss Ministers and to dissolve  Chambers.[7]  M. Venizelos himself had, no longer ago than 5 March, at  the second sitting of the Crown Council, declared himself an adversary  of the doctrine that the Parliamentary majority is absolute, and  recognized the right of the Crown to choose another Government; \"On the  other hand,\" he said, \"the necessary consequence of the formation of a  Cabinet not enjoying a majority in the Chamber is the dissolution of  the Chamber.\" [8]  It was in pursuance {71} of this advice that the  King, who, as M. Venizelos on that occasion emphatically stated, \"has  always absolutely respected the Constitution,\" [9] dissolved the  Chamber.    The only question, therefore, is about the dissolution of the Chamber  elected on 13 June, 1915, which gave M. Venizelos a majority of 56.  This action, it was alleged, violated the spirit, though not the  letter, of Constitutional Law, because the dissolved Chamber  represented the will of the people.  But, the other side retorted, it  was precisely because there was ground for believing that the  Parliamentary majority had ceased to represent the will of the people  that the King proceeded to a dissolution; and in so doing he had  excellent precedent.  His father had dissolved several Chambers  (specifically in 1902 and 1910) on the same ground, not only without  incurring any censure, but earning much applause from the Venizelist  Party.[10]  In fact, the last of those dissolutions had been carried  out by M. Venizelos himself under the following circumstances: The  General Elections of August, 1910, had given a majority to the old  parties: King George, however, in the belief that public opinion really  favoured M. Venizelos, called him to power, though he was only the  leader of a Parliamentary minority.  M. Venizelos formed a Government,  but, as the majority in Parliament obstructed his policy, he persuaded  the Sovereign to dissolve it,[11] declaring in the House (11/24  October, 1910): that \"it is impossible to limit the prerogative of the  Crown to dissolve any Chamber.\"  Obviously, what was {72} lawful for  King George could not be unlawful for King Constantine; and the fact  that M. Venizelos's majority of 56 had since the recent elections  dwindled to 16, was reason sufficient for the belief that he no longer  represented the will of the people, even if it were conceded that the  issue of war had been clearly put before the electors who had voted for  him in June, and that, at best, a majority of 56 in an assembly of 314  was an adequate expression of the will of the people on so grave an  issue.  Events had moved so fast in those months and the situation  changed so abruptly that King Constantine would have been guilty of a  dereliction of duty had he not, by exercising his indisputable  prerogative, given the nation an opportunity to reconsider its opinion.    Sophisms suited to the fury of the times apart, the whole case of M.  Venizelos against his Sovereign rested, avowedly, on the theory,  improvised for the nonce, that the Greek Constitution is a replica of  the British--a monarchical democracy in which the monarch is nothing  more than a passive instrument in the hands of a Government with a  Parliamentary majority.[12]  It is not so, and it was never meant to be  so.

LANDSCAPES.      The landscapes by Rembrandt, unhappily few in number, possess the  strong mark of truth for which his works are so strikingly fascinating.  They are chiefly small, the largest not exceeding three feet. One of his  best is in the collection of the Marquis of Lansdowne, representing a  mill seen under the influence of an uncertain twilight; the warm light  of the western sky sheds its lustre on the sails of the mill, which  stands on high ground; but the other portions of the picture are of  dark half-tint, except a reflection of the light on the water towards  the foreground. It was exhibited in the British Gallery, in 1815, and  attracted great attention. Another picture peculiar to the genius of  Rembrandt is in the collection of Sir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart.; it  represents a night scene on the skirts of a wood, with a group of  figures seated round a fire, the red gleam of which is reflected in a  stream that flows along the foreground. A few cattle are partially seen  in the obscure portions of the picture, with a peasant passing with a  lantern. Other smaller works are in the collections of Sir Robert Peel,  Samuel Rogers, Esq., Sir Abraham Hume, and the Marquis of Hertford. His  largest picture of this class was formerly in the Louvre, and is now in  the public gallery at Hesse-Cassel. In the landscapes of Rembrandt we  meet with the same breadth, and hues of a deep tone, without being black  or heavy; they are also painted with a full pencil, and rich juicy  vehicle. Rembrandt, like Titian, Rubens, and others who were historical  painters, seizes upon the great characteristics of nature without  entering into the painful fidelity of topographical littleness; the  same generalizing principles pervade every variety of subject. Fuseli,  speaking of portrait painting as mere likenesses, adds--\"To portrait  painting thus circumstanced, we subjoin, as the last branch of  uninteresting subjects, that kind of landscape which is entirely  occupied with the tame delineation of a given spot--an enumeration of  hill and dale, clumps of trees, shrubs, water, meadows, cottages, and  houses--what is commonly called views. These, if not assisted by nature,  dictated by taste, or chosen for character, may delight the owner of the  acres they enclose, the inhabitants of the spot, perhaps the antiquary  or the traveller, but to any other eye, they are little more than  topography. The landscape of Titian, of Mola, of Salvator, of the  Poussins, Claude, Rubens, Elsheimer, Rembrandt, and Wilson, spurns all  relation with this kind of map-work. To them nature disclosed her bosom  in the varied light of rising, meridian, and setting suns--in twilight,  night, and dawn.\"    [Illustration: FAC-SIMILE OF A DRAWING BY REMBRANDT IN BRITISH MUSEUM]          DRAWINGS BY REMBRANDT.      In looking over the numerous portfolios of drawings in public and  private libraries, we are struck with the accumulated mass of mediocre  talent. Many of them are often well composed, and even well drawn, but  they are completely destitute of what constitutes true merit--they  possess no distinguishing mark whereby we can discern one master from  another; they are struck off with wonderful dexterity, as far as the eye  or hand is concerned, but the mind is totally wanting; neither do they  possess the peculiar features of natural truth, whose lines are filled  with variety, sometimes sharp, sometimes round--in parts faint and  delicate, and in other places strong and cutting. On the other hand,  when the drawings of great painters are examined, the master mind shines  forth in every touch, and we recognise the works of Michael Angelo,  Raffaelle, Coreggio, and others, at a glance. The drawings of Rembrandt  possess this quality in a superlative degree, and the slightest  indication seems sufficient to mark the character and leading features  of the object represented. His drawings are generally in pen outline,  with a wash of bistre, or other warm colour; sometimes he makes use of  black and red chalk; they are seldom finished with colours, but have  often portions rendered lighter and broader by means of a wash of white.  From his great practice in using the point in etching, he not only  gives the greatest precision and certainty, but his outline assumes the  gentlest delicacy or overpowering boldness. Everything from his hand  seems to possess a largeness of form, and the greatest breadth of light  and shade that can be given; this it is that gives them the stamp of  truth, so that it is difficult to distinguish between those drawn  immediately from nature, and such as are emanations from his  imagination. On looking into the catalogue of his effects, we perceive  large folios of his drawings, which, though at the sale they produced  but small sums, are now marked with their true value. I may notice here  a small drawing of \"The Death of the Virgin,\" that brought, at the sale  of the late Baron Verstolk, one hundred and sixty guineas. One cannot  but regret that the excellent collection of the drawings by Rembrandt  and other masters, selected by the late Sir Thomas Lawrence, with great  taste and at large sums, should have been lost to the country, though  offered in his will at comparatively a small price. Nevertheless, we  possess several fine specimens in the British Museum Print-room.          THE ETCHINGS OF REMBRANDT.      No painter has gained so much celebrity by his etchings as Rembrandt,  both on account of their number and excellence. Claude, Parmegiano,  Berghem, Paul Potter, Adrian Ostade, and others, have all been dextrous  in using the etching point. Rembrandt's performances have all the  interest and beauty of finished works; his making use of the dry point,  which was unknown before his application of it, gives his etchings that  richness and softness peculiar to himself, for the process in the  hands of others has never since been attended with the same triumphant  success. The etchings consist of three hundred and sixty-five plates,  accompanied by two hundred and thirty-seven variations. I can only here  give their titles and dates: the amateur is referred to the descriptive  catalogues of Gersaint, Daulby, Bartsch, Claussin, and Wilson. The  catalogue by the latter gentleman is the one adopted by the British  Museum; I have, however, numbered them according to the Catalogue  Raisonne of Rembrandt's Works by Smith, who made use of the arrangement  of the Chevalier Claussin. I have also marked those that are of the  greatest excellence with a star before the number.
