He  will do all sorts of funny tricks, all by himself; and if he sees  anyone watching him, he will try to show how clever he is--just like a  child playing \"smarty!\"    Once in a lumber camp in the West the men caught and tamed a black  bear. After a time the bear was allowed to walk about the camp, quite  free, as he did not think of running away. One day the men had stopped  work to have their dinner. The bear walked by, and the men petted him  and said nice things to him. Then what do you think happened! The bear  felt so proud of being praised that he went to a sloping log, and  walked along it right to the top. You must know that in a lumber camp  there are lots and lots of huge logs, or trees which the men have cut  down. And one of these logs happened to rest on a slope, that is, with  one end higher than the other.    When the bear reached the top of the log, he sat across it. Then he  held on to the log with his front paws, bent his body, and slid down  the log--just as a boy slides down the banister! Of course the men  laughed, and cheered him. Then just guess what that bear did!    He walked up to the top of the log again, and sat across it, as  before. But now he held on to the log with his knees, not his paws,  and sat straight up without bending, and slid down the log in that  way--just as a boy might hold on to the banister with his knees, not  using his hands at all, and slide down the banister in that way, just  to show how smart he could be!    You may be sure those men cheered the bear, and gave him lots to eat.    There is another kind of black bear that is also funny, though in  another way. He is called the _Himalayan black bear_, because he lives  in India near some huge mountains called the Himalayas. In many ways  he is very much like the black bear of America, but he has a _white  chin_ and _long side-whiskers on his jaws_. Some people think that of  all kinds of bears he is the most handsome.    Although he often goes up very high on the side of the mountains, he  sometimes comes down to the country below, where there are many  villages. But the bear is quite friendly, and never hurts the people  in the villages, although he is strong enough to kill a man. So the  people are also very kind and friendly to him, and never try to hurt  him. When you grow up you may read that there are some people in India  who are always kind to _all_ animals, tame or wild.[2]    [Footnote 2: _To the Teacher._--Please explain to the class that the  sect called Jains do not hurt the smallest creature, and will suffer  the sting of a wasp rather than kill it.]    [Illustration: Himalayan Black Bear]    I am telling you this because you will see very soon what we gain by  being friendly even to a wild animal. The Himalayan black bear, like  the other black bear, is also very fond of honey, and of everything  sweet. In the country where he lives there grows a berry called mawa,  which is very sweet--even sweeter than the strawberry; and the people  of the villages make jam from it.    These berries grow quite wild, on bushes here and there in the fields,  and even in the jungles near by. When the berries are ripe, the people  send out their children to gather them from the bushes in the fields;  and the children carry baskets so as to bring back as many berries as  they can.    But when the berries are ripe, the bears also want to eat them! So it  sometimes happens that half a dozen children are picking the berries  from a thick bush, when suddenly a bear comes round the bush and  starts gobbling up the berries as fast as he can!    Do the children get frightened and run away? Not a bit! They want  _their_ share of the berries, too!    By this time the bush may be getting empty, and the children have not  quite filled their baskets. The bear keeps on gobbling up the berries,  and even pushing past the children to get at a bunch. What then? Why,  the children raise their hands, and _just spank the wild bear_!    \"Go away, you have had enough!\" they say. \"Can't you go to another  bush? There must be others right in the jungle, where _we_ can't go!\"    And, can you imagine it, a wild bear there has never hurt a child!  When the children spank him and push him away, telling him that he has  had enough from that bush, he _does_ go away to some other bush. Of  course, the spanking does not really hurt him.    I have told this to you, my dear, just to show you that there is never  any real reason for quarreling and fighting, among children, or even  among men. _If children and wild bears can get along together_, why  cannot children and children, or men and men, or nations and nations?  Surely there are enough berries and other good things for all, if we  only look around!    Remember this always, even when you grow up, if you want to be good  men and women, and good citizens of your country.          CHAPTER XIV    Bears: The Tricky Trap      Now I am going to tell you something funny about the bear. You have  seen lots of wild animals in the zoo, and you may sometimes have  wondered how these animals were caught. In another book I shall tell  you all about the different ways of catching different kinds of wild  animals; but now I shall only tell you how a wild bear is caught. Of  course, there are two or three ways of catching him alive, but I shall  describe to you now just one way.    You must know by this time that everybody in the world--whether man,  woman, or child--has _some fault_. Some have a bad temper, others are  rude, and still others are obstinate; and many, especially children,  are too greedy! And so it is among animals: they all have one fault or  another.    So the people who want to catch a wild animal find out first what  fault that kind of animal has--whether he is greedy, or obstinate, or  bad tempered. And they _catch the animal because of that very fault_!    A bear is very obstinate; in fact the bear, the pig, the donkey, and  the mule are among the most obstinate of animals. So, because the bear  is very obstinate, he will never give up when he meets anything that  blocks his way; and if he has made up his mind to do anything, he will  never give up, even if he finds he _cannot_ do it and that it is very  foolish to try to do it.    So the people remember the bear's obstinacy, and catch him in this  way:    They find a large tree which has a bough fifteen or twenty feet from  the ground; then they tie a pot of honey on the bough, quite two or  three yards away from the fork where the bough joins the trunk. So, if  a bear wants to get at the honey, he will have to climb up the trunk,  and then walk along the bough to the place where the pot is tied.    But the people also take a heavy stone, tie a stout rope around it,  and hang up the stone by the rope from another bough higher up. They  place the stone in such a way that it swings right in front of the  honey and a little above it. Then the people hide in thickets near by.    Presently a bear smells the honey from a distance, and comes to find  it. On reaching the place he sees the pot of honey on the tree. As  the bear is a good climber, he soon scrambles up the trunk of the tree  and walks along the bough toward the honey.    But just as he is coming to it, he sees something right before his  path. It is the block of stone! And he cannot get at the honey without  pushing the stone aside. So, what does he do? Why, quite naturally he  pushes the stone aside with his paw. But, as I have told you, the  stone is hung up by a rope; and so it _swings_ any way you may push  it.    Then what happens? Why, as soon as the bear pushes the stone aside  with his paw, the stone _swings back_ and hits him on the paw. The  bear gives a growl, and again pushes the stone aside, and this time  harder than before.    Then what happens? The stone swings back and hits the bear harder than  before! In fact, the stone will always swing back just as hard as it  is pushed.    But the bear does not know that! So with another growl he pushes the  stone again--and now much harder than before. Then of course the stone  comes back much harder, and whacks him again.    [Illustration: A Bear Fighting a Block of Stone]    This makes the bear really angry. He hits at the stone, and sends it  flying through the air in a big curve. But when the stone has gone  up and up in that curve, it begins to come down, down, the same  way--and gives the bear a thumping whack on the jaw.    Now, if the bear were not such an obstinate animal, he would go away  after that third blow, and try to forget the honey. But the bear will  never, never, give in! Instead, he gets quite mad with rage. He thinks  some enemy is hiding behind the stone!    \"Who is hitting me?\" he growls. \"Come out of that, and fight fair!\"    With that he hits a frantic blow at the stone; for the bear is a good  boxer. He sends the stone swinging through the air again, and farther  than before. Again the stone swings back and gives the bear a hard  whack.    In this way the fight goes on. Of course the stone cannot get hurt; so  it is the bear that gets hurt, every time. And as he will never give  in, he goes on fighting with the stone, and gets hurt more and more,  till at last he is knocked right off the tree, and falls stunned to  the ground.    Then the clever people rush in from their hiding place, throw a net  over the bear, and carry him away. And that is how the zoo gets some  of its bears.          CHAPTER XV    Bright Birds      Now I shall tell you something about birds; not ordinary birds, but a  special sort.    Of course, birds are not exactly animals of the kind that I have been  telling you about, as they have only two legs, instead of four. But  they have two wings, which are more useful to them than two more legs.    If they had four legs they could run fast; but with the two wings they  can fly, which is ever so much faster and better than running. And  they still have two legs with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24855"],[0,"Concrete Construction: Methods and Costs (#17)"],[1,"about 10 ft. above  ground. As the concrete filled in the hopper was raised and the chute  cut off. The hopper was kept full all the time and was discharged by  bottom gate and spout into wheelbarrows. In a fourth case the apparatus  shown by the sketch, Fig. 14, was used. The continuous mixer discharged  onto an 18-in. rubber conveyor belt on conical rollers and 18 ft. long.  The inner end of the conveyor frame was carried on the ground at the  edge of the pit and the outer end was supported by ropes from the top of  a gallows frame standing on the pit bottom. The belt discharged over end  into a vertical steel chute 12 ins. in diameter and 8 ft. long; this  chute was fastened to the conveyor frame. Encircling and overlapping the  12-in. chute was a second slightly larger chute suspended by means of  two ropes from the gallows frame. The bottom of this second chute was  kept about 6 ins. below the top edges of a pyramidal hopper like the one  described above. In operation the chutes and the hopper were kept filled  with concrete so that the only drop of the concrete was 3 ft. from the  conveyor belt into the topmost chute.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Belt Conveyor and Chute for Handling Concrete.]    Concrete may be handled in long flat chutes by stationing men along the  chute with shovels which they work like paddles to keep the mixture  moving. In one case concrete was so handled in a chute 200 ft. long  having a slope of 1 in 10 ft. The chute was a V-shaped trough made of  1×12-in. boards in sections 16 ft. long. The men paddling were stationed  10 ft. apart, so that with wages at $1.50 per day the cost would be 1½  cts. per cu. yd. for every 10 ft. the concrete was conveyed. In  connection with this particular work we are informed that a Eureka  continuous mixer was used. The gravel was dumped near the mixer and a  team hitched to a drag scraper delivered the gravel alongside the mixer.  Four men shoveled the gravel into the measuring hopper, but only two men  worked at a time, shoveling for a period of 15 minutes and then resting  for a corresponding period while the other two men worked. In this  manner the four men shoveled enough gravel to make 100 cu. yds. of  concrete per day. A fifth man opened the cement bags and kept the cement  hopper filled.    ~METHODS OF CHARGING MIXERS.~--By charging is meant the process of  delivering raw materials from stock into the mixer. Several methods are  practiced and will be considered in the following order: (1) By gravity  from overhead bins; (2) by wheelbarrow or hand cart (a) to charging  chute and (b) to elevating charging hoppers; (3) by charging cars  operated by cable or other means; (4) by shoveling directly into mixer;  (5) by derricks or other hoists.    ~Charging by Gravity from Overhead Bins.~--Chuting the sand and stone from  overhead bins to the charging hopper is a simple, rapid and economical  method of charging mixers. The bottoms of the bins should always be high  enough above the charging floor to give ample head room for men to move  about erect, and the length of chute may be anything reasonable more  than this that conditions such as the side hill delivery of material may  necessitate. When the mixer is located to one side of the bins the slope  of the chute will have to be watched. Broken stone or pebbles will move  on a comparatively flat slope but sand, particularly if damp, requires a  steep chute. The measuring hopper is best kept entirely independent of  the mixer so that it can be filled with a new charge while the mixer is  turning and discharging the preceding batch. One man can attend the sand  and cement chutes if they be conveniently arranged, and one man can open  and empty the cement bags if they be stacked close at hand. A third man  will level off the sand and stone in the measuring hopper and help in  the chuting. A gang of this size will easily measure up a charge every 2  minutes when no delays occur.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Side Hill Mixing Plant.]    A number of plants charging by gravity from overhead bins are described  in succeeding chapters and are referenced in the index. As a general  example a side hill plant of conventional construction is shown by Fig.  15. The trestle work was made of 12×12-in. timbers and was approximately  40 ft. in height. Three tracks occupy the top platform. Under each track  was a material bin; one on each side for gravel and a middle bin for  sand. The sand bin was divided by a partition into two compartments.  These bins discharged into two measuring hoppers one gravel bin and one  compartment of the sand bin into each hopper. Two cement chutes from the  top platform provided for the delivery of the cement to the mixers,  either directly from cars or from the cement storage house. The mixing  was done in two Smith No. 5 mixers, one under each measuring hopper, and  these mixers discharged by chutes into buckets on flat cars. Thus the  concrete materials brought directly from a siding in car load lots to  the top of the platform were handled entirely by gravity to the cars  delivering the mixed concrete to the work. The gang operating the mixing  plant, with the wages paid, was composed as follows: 1 foreman and  engineer at $3 per day, 1 fireman at $2 per day and 15 laborers at $1.50  per day. With this gang the two mixers turned out 400 cu. yds. of  concrete per day and, frequently, 800 cu. yds. in 24 hours. Taking these  figures the labor cost from raw materials in cars on the platform to  mixed concrete in cars on the delivery track was as follows:    1 foreman and engineer at $3            $ 3.00  1 fireman at $2                           2.00  15 laborers at $1.50                     22.50                                           -----  Total labor                             $27.50    Assuming 400 cu. yds. output, this gives a cost of $27.50 ÷ 400 = 6.875  cts. per cu. yd.    ~Charging with Wheelbarrows.~--The economics of wheelbarrow haulage are  discussed in some detail in Chapter III. For machine mixer work the  problem of loading, transporting and dumping is complicated by the  greater rapidity with which the mixing is done and by the necessity,  usually, of using inclines to reach the charging hopper level. The  incline cuts down the output of the wheelers or in other words makes  necessary a larger gang to handle the same amount of material.  Conditions being the same, the height of the charging chute of the mixer  determines the height of incline and the size of the charging gang, so  that a mixer with a high charging level costs more to charge with  wheelbarrows than does one with a low charging level. Exact figures of  the increased cost of a few feet extra elevation of the wheelbarrow  incline are not available, but some idea may be had from a brief  calculation. The materials for a cubic yard of concrete will weigh about  3,700 lbs., so that to raise the materials for 100 cu. yds. of concrete,  including weight of barrows, 1 ft. calls for about 400,000 ft. lbs. of  work. A man will do about 800,000 ft. lbs. of useful work in a day, so  that each foot of additional height of incline means an additional  half-day's work for one man.    Wheeling to elevating charging hoppers obviates the use of inclines.  Figure 19 shows a mixer equipped with such a hopper, and the arrangement  provided for other makes of mixer is much similar. When the hopper is  lowered ready to receive its load its top edge over which the  wheelbarrows are dumped is from 12 to 14 ins. above ground level. The  wheeling is all done on the level. The elevating bucket is operated by  the mixer engine and is usually detachable. Where mixers have to be  moved frequently, requiring the erection and moving of the incline each  time, an elevating charging hopper is particularly useful; it can be  hoisted clear of the ground and moved with the mixer, so that it is  ready to use the moment that the mixer is set at its new station.    While the ordinary wheelbarrow is generally used for charging, better  work can be done under some conditions by using special charging barrows  of larger capacity and dumping from the end and ahead of the wheel. Two  forms of charging barrow are shown by Figs. 16 and 17. The Acme barrow  will hold 4 cu. ft. and the Ransome barrow is made in 3 to 6 cu. ft.  capacities. Where inclines are necessary these barrows can often be  hauled up the incline by power. A sprocket chain in the plane of the  incline and operated by the mixer engine is an excellent arrangement. A  prong riveted to the rear face of the barrow and projecting downward is  \"caught into\" the chain, which pulls the barrow to the top, the man  following to dump and return for another load.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Forward Dump Charging Barrow, Sterling  Wheelbarrow Co.]    [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Forward Dump Charging Barrow, Ransome Concrete  Machinery Co.]    ~Charging with Cars.~--Cars moved by cable, team or hand are a  particularly economic charging device when the mixer is located a little  distance from the stock piles or bins. Either separate cars for cement,  sand and stone, each holding the proper amount of its material for a  batch, can be used, or a single car containing enough of all three  materials for a batch. The last arrangement is ordinarily more  economical in time and labor, and in plant required. In either case the  car serves as the measuring hopper, there being no further proportioning  of the materials after they have been loaded into the car, and it must  be arranged for measuring. Usually all that is necessary, where one car  is used, is to mark the levels on the sides to which it is to be filled  with sand and then stone; the car is run to the sand stock and filled to  the level marked for sand and then to the stone stock and filled to the  level marked for stone. The cement may be added to the charge either  before or after it is run to the mixer as convenience in storing the"]]]
