Now  here (b) he leaped out after the snow ceased, for the tracks are sharp,  and sat looking around. See the two long marks of his hind feet and in  front the two smaller prints of his front feet; behind is the mark made  by his tail, showing that he was sitting on it.    Then he had taken alarm at something and dashed off at speed (c), for  now his hind feet are tracking ahead of the front feet, as in most  bounding forefoots, and the faster he goes, the farther ahead those hind  feet get.    See now how he dodged about here and there, this way and that, among the  trees, as though trying to escape some dreaded enemy (c, d, e, f).    But what enemy? There are no other tracks, and still the wild jumping  went on.    I began to think that the Rabbit was crazy, flying from an imaginary  foe; possibly that I was on the track of a March Hare. But at \"g\" I  found on the trail for the first time a few drops of blood. That told me  that the Rabbit was in real danger but gave no clue to its source.    At \"h\" I found more blood and at \"j\" I got a new thrill, for there,  plain enough on each side of the Rabbit track, were finger-like marks,  and the truth dawned on me that these were the prints of great wings.  The Rabbit was fleeing from an eagle, a hawk, or an owl. Some twenty  yards farther \"k\" I found in the snow the remains of the luckless Rabbit  partly devoured. Then I knew that the eagle had not done it, for he  would have taken the Rabbit's body away, not eaten him up there. So it  must have been a hawk or an owl. I looked for something to tell me  which, and I got it. Right by the Rabbit's remains was the large  twin-toed track (l) that told me that an owl had been there, and that  therefore he was the criminal. Had it been a hawk the mark would have  been as shown in the left lower corner, three toes forward and one back,  whereas the owl usually sets his foot with two toes forward and two  backward, as in the sketch. This, then, I felt sure was the work of an  owl. But which owl? There were two, maybe three kinds in that valley. I  wished to know exactly and, looking for further evidence, I found on a  sapling near by a big soft, downy, owlish feather (m) with three brown  bars across it; which told me plainly that a Barred Owl or Hoot Owl had  been there recently, and that he was almost certainly the killer of the  Cottontail.    This may sound like a story of Sherlock Holmes among the animals--a  flimsy tale of circumstantial evidence. But while I was making my notes,  what should come flying through the woods but the Owl himself, back to  make another meal, no doubt. He alighted on a branch just above my head,  barely ten feet up, and there gave me the best of proof, next to eye  witness of the deed, that all I had gathered from the tracks and signs  in the snow was quite true.    I had no camera in those days, but had my sketch book, and as he sat, I  made a drawing which hangs to-day among my pictures that are beyond  price.    Here, then, is a chapter of wild life which no man saw, which man could  not have seen, for the presence of a man would have prevented it. And  yet we know it was true, for it was written by the Rabbit himself.    If you have the seeing eye, you will be able to read many strange and  thrilling happenings written for you thus in the snow, the mud, and even  the sand and the dust.      TALE 57    The Singing Hawk    Listen, Guide and young folk, I want to add another bird to your list  to-day; another secret of the woods to your learning.    I want you to know the Singing Hawk. Our nature writers nearly always  make their hawks scream, but I want you to know a wonderful Hawk, right  in your own woods, that really and truly sings, and loves to do it.    It is a long time ago since I first met him. I was going past a little  ravine north of Toronto, on a bright warm mid-winter day, when a loud  call came ringing down the valley and the bird that made it, a large  hawk, appeared, sailing and singing, _kee-o, kee-o, kee-o, kee-o, kee-o,  kee-ye-o, ky-ye-o, ky-oodle, ky-oodle, kee-o, kee-o_ and on; over and  over again, in a wild-wood tone that thrilled me. He sailed with set  wings to a near-by tree, and ceased not his stirring call; there was no  answer from the woods, but there was a vibrant response in my heart. It  moved me through and through. How could it do so much, when it was so  simple? I did not know how to tell it in words, but I felt it in my  boyish soul. It expressed all the wild-wood life and spirit, the joy of  living, the happy brightness of the day, the thrill of the coming  spring, the glory of flight; all, all it seemed to voice in its simple  ringing, \"_kee-o, kee-o, kee-o, kee-yi-o_\"; never before had I seen a  bird so evidently rejoicing in his flight; then singing, it sailed away  from sight; but the song has lingered ever since in the blessed part of  my memory. I often heard it afterward, and many times caught the  Blue-jay in a feeble imitation of its trumpet note. I never forgot the  exact timbre of that woodland call; so when at length, long after, I  traced it to what is known in books as the \"Red-shouldered Hawk,\" it was  a little triumph and a little disappointment. The books made it all so  commonplace. They say it has a loud call like \"kee-o\"; but they do not  say that it has a bugle note that can stir your very soul if you love  the wild things, and voices more than any other thing on wings the glory  of flight, the blessedness of being alive.    To-day, as I write, is December 2, 1917; and this morning as I walked in  my homeland, a sailing, splendid hawk came pouring out the old refrain,  \"_kee-yi-o, kee-yi-o, kee-oh_.\" Oh, it was glorious! I felt little  prickles in the roots of my hair as he went over; and I rejoiced above  all things to realize that he sang just as well as, yes maybe a little  better than that first one did, that I heard in the winter woods some  forty years ago.      TALE 58    The Fingerboard Goldenrod    \"Oh, Mother Carey! All-mother! Lover of us little plants as well as the  big trees! Listen to us little slender Goldenrods.    \"We want to be famous, Mother Carey, but our stems are so little and our  gold is so small, that we cannot count in the great golden show of  autumn, for that is the glory of our tall cousins. They do not need us,  and they do not want us. Won't you give us a little job all our own, our  very own, for we long to be doing something?\"    [Illustration: The Compass Goldenrod Pointing Toward the North]    Then Mother Carey smiled so softly and sweetly and said: \"Little slender  Goldenrods, I am going to give you something to do that will win you  great honour among all who understand. In the thick woods the moss on  the trunk shows the north side; when the tree is alone and in the open,  the north side is known by its few branches; but on the open prairie,  there is no plant that stands up like a finger post to point the north  for travellers, while the sun is hid.\"    \"This, then do, little slender Goldenrods; face the noon sun, and as you  stand, throw back your heads proudly, for you are in service now. Throw  back your heads till your golden plumes are pointing backward to the  north--so shall you have an honourable calling and travellers will be  glad that I have made you a fingerboard on the plains.\"    So the slender Goldenrod and his brothers rejoiced and they stood up  straight, facing the noon sun, and bent backward, throwing out their  chests till their golden caps and plumes were pointed to the north.    And many a traveller, on cloudy days and dark nights, has been cheered  by the sight of the Compass Goldenrod, pointing to the north and helping  him to get home.    This does not mean that every one of them points to the north all the  time. They do their best but there are always some a little wrong. Yet  you can tell the direction at night or on dark days if you look at a bed  of them that grew out in full sunlight.    \"Yon is the north,\" they keep on singing, all summer long, and even when  winter comes to kill the plant, and end its bloom, the brave little  stalk stands up there, in snow to its waist, bravely pointing out the  north, to those who have learned its secret. And not only in winter  storms, but I have even found them still on guard after the battle, when  the snow melted in springtime. Once when I was a boy, I found a whole  bank of them by a fence, when the snow went off in April, and I wrote  in their honour this verse:            Some of them bowed are, and broken            And battered and lying low          But the few that are left stand like spearmen staunch            Each pointing his pike at the foe.      TALE 59    Woodchuck Day, February Second Sixth Secret of the Woods    [Illustration: WOODCHUCK DAY: COLD WEATHER    \"To be, or not to be\"]    It was Monapini that told Ruth Pilgrim, and Ruth Pilgrim told the little  Pilgrims, and the little Pilgrims told the little Dutchmen, and the  little Dutchmen told it to all the little Rumours, and the grandchild of  one of these little Rumours told it to me, so you see I have it straight  and on good authority, this Sixth Secret of the Woods.    The story runs that every year the wise Woodchuck retires to sleep in  his cozy home off the subway that he made, when the leaves begin to  fall, and he has heard the warning. Mother Carey has sung the death-song  of the red leaves; sung in a soft voice that yet reaches the farthest  hills:            \"Gone are the summer birds.           Hide, hide, ye slow-foots.           Hide, for the blizzard comes.\"    And Mother Earth, who is Maka Ina, cries to her own: \"Come, hide in my  bosom, my little ones.\" And the wise Woodchuck waits not till the  blizzard comes, but hides while he may make good housing, and sleeps for  three long moons.

Leland, in his \"Itinerary,\" was  equally struck with its beauty, although, as the frontispiece shows,  the surroundings were very different before Wyatt's exploits, and  probably in Leland's time preserved still more of their mediaeval  aspect. He says: \"The great and large embatelid waulle of the palace  having 3 gates to entre into it thus namyd: the close gate as  principale by north ynto the town, Saint Anne's gate by est, and  Harnham gate by south toward Harham bridge. The close wall was never  ful finished as in one place evidently apperith I redde that in Bishop  Rogers days as I remembere a convention was between him and the Canons  of Saresbyri de Muro clausi.\"    Whether the builders of our great churches were conscious of the  beauty of their surroundings, or whether no little of that loveliness  is but the slow result of centuries of care and the accident of  natural growth, need not be discussed. That to an American especially  this peculiar beauty tells with great force we can readily believe,  and Mrs. Van Rensselaer, whose paper on Salisbury has been quoted  before in this book, expresses admirably the feeling, which, whether  it be true or only imaginary, is no doubt the impression of such a  place as the Close of Salisbury on many an educated visitor.  \"Salisbury,\" she writes, \"is the very type and picture of the Church  of the Prince of Peace. Nowhere else does a work of Christian  architecture so express purity and repose and the beauty of holiness,  while the green pastures that surround it might well be those of which  the Psalmist writes. When the sun shines on the pale grey stones, and  the level grass, and the silent trees, and throws the long shadow of  the spire across them, it is as though a choir of seraphs sang in  benediction of that peace of God which passeth understanding. The men  who built and planted here were sick of the temples of Baalim, tired  of being cribbed and cabined, weary of quarrelsome winds and voices.  They wanted space and sun, and stillness, comfort and rest, and  beauty, and the quiet ownership of their own; and no men ever more  perfectly expressed, for future times to read, the ideal they had in  mind.\"    The =Bell Tower=, a striking feature of the close as it was before  1789, is shown on page 19, in the facsimile of an engraving originally  published in 1761, and re-engraved in the superb County History in  1804(?). This shows the campanile standing at the north-west corner of  the inclosure.    In style it was about the same period as the chapter house and  cloisters. The plan appears to have been square, although one writer,  frequently quoted, calls it multangular; the stone tower was in two  massive stories with lancet windows in the lower, and windows with  plate tracery above, with a spire apparently of wood crowning the  whole. Leland speaks of it as \"a notable and strong square tower for  great belles, and a pyramis on it, in the cemiterie.\" It was evidently  massive enough to have stood for centuries, and the single pillar of  Purbeck marble, \"lying in its natural bed,\" which was the central  support that carried the bells, the belfry, and the spire, is  specially mentioned by Price as perfectly sound, but he owns that the  leaden spire, and a wooden upper story, were decayed, and puts forward  a design of a sham classic dome which he hopes might be erected in its  place. When the cathedral was visited in 1553 by the Royal Commission  there remained a peal of ten bells, and the re-casting in 1680 of the  seventh and eighth by the Purdues, local founders, is recorded among  the muniments. The sixth is now the clock bell of the cathedral, but  the fate of the others is absolutely unknown.       [Illustration: DEATH AND THE GALLANT.]    Several of Wyatt's iconoclastic blunders have been already mentioned;  we now come to his chief iniquity. The =Hungerford Chapel=, demolished  by Wyatt, stood at the east end of the building on the north side of  the Lady Chapel, with which it was connected by openings cut in the  main wall. This chapel was one of those of which Fuller so quaintly  wrote, \"A chantry was what we call in grammar an adjective, unable to  stand of itself, and was therefore united for better support to some  ... church.\" An addition to the building in a much later style, it was  founded by Margaret (daughter and sole heir of William, Lord  Botreaux,) in 1464; she was interred within its walls in 1477. Her  history, too full to note here, is a sad one, the loss of her movable  goods by \"fyre\" in Amesbury Abbey being but a small incident among her  many troubles. A peculiarly interesting inventory of the ornaments and  furniture that she gave to this chantry has been preserved; it is  printed in Dugdale's \"Baronage,\" vol. ii., p. 207, and also in \"The  Wiltshire Archaeological Magazine,\" vol. xi. The chapel, in the  somewhat florid late Perpendicular style, had a large east window of  five lights, and three of triple lights in its north wall. The outside  was adorned with shields and devices of the family, and crested with  battlements. Within it had a richly-groined roof, and underneath a  large arch cut in the north wall of the Lady Chapel, and therefore  opening into the hall of the chantry, stood the monument of Lord  Hungerford, surmounted by an ornamental four-arched canopy. This altar  tomb, now devoid of the gold and colour that once enriched it, is in  the nave. Its armour, \"like a lobster,\" with its peculiar pattern, its  large shoulders and elbow-pieces, and its jewelled girdle, is quoted  by Meyrick as a very fine example of its period. Above were eight  niches of demi-quatrefoiled arches, with a fascia of quatrefoils  surmounted by a cornice of oak leaves. Between the monument and the  doorway was a series of wall-paintings of great interest. One, \"Death  and the Gallant,\" has been engraved, and the dialogue below it  preserved. As the verses are archaic in spelling, it may be best to  follow a more modern version (\"Wilts Archaeological Magazine,\" vol.  ii., p. 95):        \"Alas, Death alas! a blissful thing thou were      If thou wouldst spare us in our lustiness,      And come to wretches that be of heavy cheer      When they thee ask to lighten their distress.      But out, alas, thine own self-willedness      Harshly refuses them that weep and wail      To close their eyes that after thee do call.        Graceless Gallant in all thy lust and pride      Remember this, that thou shalt one day die,      Death shall from thy body thy soul divide--      Thou mayst him escape not certainly,      To the dead bodies (here) cast down thine eye;      Behold them well, consider too and see,      For such as they are, such shalt thou too be.\"    Of this Mr. Francis Douce, in his volume \"The Dance of Death,\" says it  was \"undoubtedly a portion of the Macaber Dance, as there was close to  it another compartment belonging to the same subject. This painting  was made about the year 1460, and from the remaining specimen its  destruction is greatly to be regretted, as judging from the dress of  the young gallant the dresses of the time would be correctly  exhibited.\"    There were other wall paintings, including a large St. Christopher  with the Christ Child on his shoulder, and an Annunciation, said to  have been a fine work. An interesting memorial of the chapel as it  stood in the middle of the seventeenth century, is to be found in an  MS. pocket-book, still preserved in the British Museum (Harl. MS.  939), which belonged to a Captain Symons, of the Royalist Army. When  he visited Salisbury in 1644 he made many notes and sketches of the  armorial bearings in this chantry.    =The Beauchamp Chapel.=--The interior view here reproduced from  \"Gough's Sepulchral Monuments of Great Britain\" although not very  clear is curiously interesting, conveying as it does trustworthy  evidence of the building so wantonly swept away.       [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE DEMOLISHED BEAUCHAMP CHAPEL.]    Of the Beauchamp Chapel, on the south side of the Lady Chapel, there  appears to be no exterior view extant, but from sketches of its  interior, and descriptions, it must have been a fine specimen of its  period, and worthy of its designer, the builder of St. George's  Chapel, Windsor. It was larger and more elaborate in detail than the  Hungerford chantry, but like it in plan, and similarly lighted by one  large east window, and three in the side wall. The remains of its  founder, Bishop Beauchamp, reposed in a plain tomb in the centre. In  the wall on the north side were exquisite canopies above the tombs of  the father and mother of the bishop. An altar tomb of Sir John Cheyne,  now in the nave, stood formerly at the south-west corner (see page  48). There was a custom that on Christmas Day and all holy days the  wives of the mayor and aldermen and gentry of the city, came to  prayers in the Beauchamp chapel in the evening with flambeaux and  torches, excepting on Innocents' Day, when they went to their own  parish churches. In an interesting Guide to the Cathedral, now in the  British Museum, annotated in the last century by some visitor, we  find an entry concerning this chapel, \"The ceiling is of Irish oak,  and never known to have spiders or cobwebs in it.\"    Much of the carved work in both these chantries was employed elsewhere  in the buildings. The plea put forward for their removal was founded  on a report by Francis Price thirty-six years before, wherein he  considered them unsafe. When the Hungerford Chantry was added one of  the outside buttresses of the Lady Chapel aisle was removed to make  room for it; the opening pierced through the main walls of the  cathedral into both the chapels were also sources of weakness. Wyatt  seized upon these facts,"]]]
