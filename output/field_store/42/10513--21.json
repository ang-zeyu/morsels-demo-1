[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19734"],[0,"The Fairy Book (#17)"],[1,"the cow chewed the thistle, Tom, terrified at her great teeth, which  seemed ready to crush him to pieces, roared, \"Mother, mother!\" as loud  as he could bawl.    \"Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?' said the mother.    \"Here, mother, here in the red cow's mouth.\"    The mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised at  such odd noises in her throat, opened her mouth and let him drop out.  His mother clapped him into her apron, and ran home with him. Tom's  father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle with, and  being one day in the field he slipped into a deep furrow. A raven  flying over picked him up with a grain of corn, and flew with him to  the top of a giant's castle by the sea-side, where he left him; and  old Grumbo, the giant, coming soon after to walk upon his terrace,  swallowed Tom like a pill, clothes and all. Tom presently made the  giant very uncomfortable, and he threw him up into the sea. A great  fish then swallowed him. This fish was soon after caught, and sent as  a present to King Arthur. When it was cut open, everybody was  delighted with little Tom Thumb. The king made him his dwarf; he was  the favourite of the whole court; and, by his merry pranks, often  amused the queen and the knights of the Round Table. The king, when he  rode on horseback, frequently took Tom in his hand; and if a shower of  rain came on, he used to creep into the king's waist-coat-pocket, and  sleep till the rain was over. The king also sometimes questioned Tom  concerning his parents; and when Tom informed his majesty they were  very poor people, the king led him into his treasury, and told him he  should pay his friends a visit, and take with him as much money as he  could carry. Tom procured a little purse, and putting a threepenny  piece into it, with much labour and difficulty got it upon his back;  and after travelling two days and nights, arrived at his father's  house. His mother met him at the door, almost tired to death, having  in forty-eight hours travelled almost half a mile with a huge silver  threepence upon his back. Both his parents were glad to see him,  especially when he had brought such an amazing sum of money with him.  They placed him in a walnut-shell by the fireside, and feasted him for  three days upon a hazel-nut, which made him sick, for a whole nut  usually served him for a month. Tom got well, but could not travel  because it had rained: therefore his mother took him in her hand, and  with one puff blew him into King Arthur's court; where Tom entertained  the king, queen, and nobility at tilts and tournaments, at which he  exerted himself so much that he brought on a fit of sickness, and his  life was despaired of. At this juncture the queen of the fairies came  in a chariot, drawn by flying mice, placed Tom by her side, and drove  through the air, without stopping till they arrived at her palace;  when, after restoring him to health and permitting him to enjoy all  the gay diversions of Fairyland, she commanded a fair wind, and,  placing Tom before it, blew him straight to the court of King Arthur.  But just as Tom should have alighted in the courtyard of the palace,  the cook happened to pass along with the king's great bowl of  furmenty (King Arthur loved furmenty), and poor Tom Thumb fell plump  into the middle of it, and splashed the hot furmenty into the cook's  eyes. Down went the bowl.    \"Oh dear! oh dear!\" cried Tom.    \"Murder! murder!\" bellowed the cook; and away poured the king's nice  furmenty into the kennel.    The cook was a red-faced, cross fellow, and swore to the king that Tom  had done it out of mere mischief; so he was taken up, tried, and  sentenced to be beheaded. Tom hearing this dreadful sentence, and  seeing a miller stand by with his mouth wide open, he took a good  spring, and jumped down the miller's throat, unperceived by all, even  by the miller himself.    Tom being lost, the court broke up, and away went the miller to his  mill. But Tom did not leave him long at rest: he began to roll and  tumble about, so that the miller thought himself bewitched, and sent  for a doctor. When the doctor came, Tom began to dance and sing; the  doctor was as much frightened as the miller, and sent in great haste  for five more doctors and twenty learned men. While all these were  debating upon the affair, the miller (for they were very tedious)  happened to yawn, and Tom, taking the opportunity, made another jump,  and alighted on his feet in the middle of the table. The miller,  provoked to be thus tormented by such a little creature, fell into a  great passion, caught hold of Tom, and threw him out of the window  into the river. A large salmon swimming by snapped him up in a minute.  The salmon was soon caught and sold in the market to a steward of a  lord. The lord, thinking it an uncommon fine fish, made a present of  it to the king, who ordered it to be dressed immediately. When the  cook cut open the salmon, he found poor Tom, and ran with him directly  to the king; but the king, being busy with state affairs, desired that  he might be brought another day. The cook resolving to keep him safely  this time, as he had so lately given him the slip, clapped him into a  mouse-trap, and left him to amuse himself by peeping through the wires  for a whole week; when the king sent for him, he forgave him for  throwing down the furmenty, ordered him new clothes, and knighted  him:--        \"His shirt was made of butterflies' wings,      His boots were made of chicken skins;      His coat and breeches were made with pride:      A tailor's needle hung by his side;      A mouse for a horse he used to ride.\"    Thus dressed and mounted, he rode a-hunting with the king and  nobility, who all laughed heartily at Tom and his fine prancing steed.  As they rode by a farmhouse one day, a cat jumped from behind the  door, seized the mouse and little Tom, and began to devour the mouse;  however, Tom boldly drew his sword and attacked the cat, who then let  him fall. The king and his nobles, seeing Tom falling, went to his  assistance, and one of the lords caught him in his hat; but poor Tom  was sadly scratched, and his clothes were torn by the claws of the  cat. In this condition he was carried home, when a bed of down was  made for him in a little ivory cabinet. The queen of the fairies came  and took him again to Fairyland, where she kept him for some years;  and then, dressing him in bright green, sent him flying once more  through the air to the earth, in the days of King Thunstone. The  people flocked far and near to look at him; and the king, before whom  he was carried, asked him who he was, whence he came, and where he  lived? Tom answered:--        \"My name Is Tom Thumb,      From the Fairies I come;      When King Arthur shone,      This court was my home.      In me he delighted,      By him I was knighted;      Did you never hear of      Sir Thomas Thumb?\"    The king was so charmed with this address, that he ordered a little  chair to be made, in order that Tom might sit on his table, and also a  palace of gold a span high, with a door an inch wide, for little Tom  to live in. He also gave him a coach drawn by six small mice, This  made the queen angry, because she had not a new coach too: therefore,  resolving to ruin Tom, she complained to the king that he had behaved  very insolently to her. The king sent for him in a rage. Tom, to  escape his fury, crept into an empty snail-shell, and there lay till  he was almost starved; when, peeping out of the hole, he saw a fine  butterfly settle on the ground: he now ventured out, and getting  astride, the butterfly took wing, and mounted into the air with  little Tom on his back. Away he flew from field to field, from tree to  tree, till at last he flew to the king's court. The king, queen, and  nobles, all strove to catch the butterfly, but could not. At length  poor Tom, having neither bridle nor saddle, slipped from his seat, and  fell into a watering-pot, where he was found almost drowned. The queen  vowed he should be guillotined; but while the guillotine was getting  ready, he was secured once more in a mouse-trap; when the cat, seeing  something stir, and supposing it to be a mouse, patted the trap about  till she broke it, and set Tom at liberty. Soon afterwards a spider,  taking him for a fly, made at him. Tom drew his sword and fought  valiantly, but the spider's poisonous breath overcame him:--        \"He fell dead on the ground where late he had stood,      And the spider suck'd up the last drop of his blood.\"    King Thunstone and his whole court went into mourning for little Tom  Thumb. They buried him under a rosebush, and raised a nice white  marble monument over his grave, with the following epitaph:--        \"Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur's knight,      Who died by a spider's cruel bite.      He was well known in Arthur's court,      Where he afforded gallant sport;      He rode at tilt and tournament,      And on a mouse a-hunting went;      Alive he fill'd the court with mirth,      His death to sorrow soon gave birth.      Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head,      And cry, 'Alas! Tom Thumb is dead.'\"          RUMPELSTILZCHEN.      There was once a miller who was very poor, but he had a beautiful  daughter. Now, it happened that he came to speak to the king, and, to  give himself importance, he said to him, \"I have a daughter who can  spin straw into gold.\"    The king said to the miller, \"That is a talent that pleases me well;  if she be as skilful as you say, bring her to-morrow to the palace,  and I will put her to the proof.\"    When the maiden was brought to him, he led her to a room full of  straw, gave her a wheel and spindle, and said, \"Now set to work, and  if by the morrow this straw be not spun into gold, you shall die.\" He  locked the door, and left the maiden alone.    The poor girl sat down disconsolate, and could not for her life think  what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19737"],[0,"The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture, Elucidated (#17)"],[1,"work on the under-part, furnished a small kind of seat or ledge,  constructed for the purpose of inclining against rather than sitting on;  and this was called the _misericorde_ or _miserere_. The _formulae_ or  forms when down, and the misericordes when the forms were turned up, were  used as the season required for penitential inclinations[174-*]. In front  of these stalls was a desk, ornamented on the exterior with panelled  tracery; and over the stalls, especially of those of cathedral churches,  canopies of tabernacle work richly carved were sometimes disposed. In  Winchester Cathedral we have perhaps the most early, chaste, and beautiful  example of the canons' stalls, with canopies over, that are to be met  with, although a greater excess of minute carved ornament may be found in  the canopies which overhang the stalls in other cathedrals. In old  conventual churches, now no longer used as such, the stalls have been  often removed from their original position to other parts of the church,  and they appear to have varied in number according to that of the  fraternity.    [Illustration: Misericorde, All Souls' College, Oxford.]    [Illustration: Brass Reading Desk, Merton College Chapel, Oxford.]    In the choirs of cathedral and conventual churches, and in the chancels of  some other churches, a movable desk, at which the epistle and gospel were  read, was placed: this was often called the eagle desk, from its being  frequently sustained on a brazen eagle with expanded wings, elevated on a  stand, emblematic of St. John the evangelist. Eagle desks are generally  found either of the fifteenth or seventeenth century; notices of them  occur, however, much earlier. In the Louterell Psalter, written circa A. D.  1300, an eagle desk supported on a cylindrical shaft, banded midway down  by an annulated moulding in the style of the thirteenth century, is  represented; and in an account of ornaments belonging to Salisbury  Cathedral, A. D. 1214, we find mentioned _Tuellia una ad Lectricum Aquilae_.  Besides the brass eagle desks which still remain in use in several of our  cathedrals, and in the chapels of some of the colleges at Oxford and  Cambridge, fine specimens are preserved in Redcliffe Church, Bristol, of  the date 1638; in Croydon Church, Surrey; and in the church of the Holy  Trinity at Coventry; other instances might also be enumerated. Sometimes  we meet with ancient brass reading-desks which have not the eagle in  front, but both the sides are sloped so as to form a double desk: of  these, examples of the fifteenth century may be found in Yeovil Church,  Somersetshire, and in the chapel of Merton College, Oxford. Ancient wooden  reading-desks, either single or double, are also occasionally found; some  of these are richly carved, others are comparatively plain, but all  partake more or less of the architectonic style of the age in which they  were severally constructed, and from which their probable dates may be  ascertained. In Bury Church, Huntingdonshire, is a wooden desk with a  single slope, and the vertical face presented in front is covered with  arches and other carved ornaments: this perhaps may be referable to the  latter part of the fourteenth century. A rich double desk, of somewhat  later date, with the shaft supported by buttresses of open-work tracery,  is preserved in Ramsey Church, Huntingdonshire. In Aldbury Church,  Hertfordshire, is an ancient double lecturn or reading desk, of wood, of  the fifteenth century, much plainer in design than those at Bury and  Ramsey; the shaft is angular, with small buttresses at the angles, and  with a plain angular-shaped moulded capital and base, which latter is set  on a cross-tree. In Hawstead Church, Suffolk, is a wooden desk with little  ornament, supported on an angular shaft with an embattled capital, and  moulded base with leaves carved in relief: this is apparently of the  latter part of the fourteenth century. The ancient wooden desks found in  some of our churches must not, however, be confounded with a more numerous  class constructed and used subsequent to the Reformation.    Proceeding up the chancel or choir, we ascend by three steps to the  platform, on which the high altar anciently stood: this was so called to  distinguish it from other altars, of which there were often several, in  the same church; high mass was celebrated at it, whereas the other altars  were chiefly used for the performance of low or private masses. The most  ancient altars were of wood, afterwards they were constructed of stone;  those of the primitive British churches are spoken of by St. Chrysostom.  By a decree of the council of Paris, held A. D. 509, no altar was to be  built but of stone. Amongst the excerptions of Ecgbert, archbishop of York  A. D. 750, was one that no altars should be consecrated with chrism but  such as were made of stone; and by the council of Winchester, held under  Lanfranc A. D. 1076, altars were enjoined to be of stone. The customary  form of such was a mass of stone supporting an altar table or slab, and  resembling the tombs of the martyrs, at which the primitive Christians  held their meetings; from which circumstance it became customary to  enclose in every altar relics of some saint, and without such relics an  altar was esteemed incomplete.    [Illustration: Ancient Pix, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.]    Pertaining to the high altar, which was covered with a frontal and cloths,  and anciently enclosed at the sides with curtains suspended on rods of  iron projecting from the wall, was a crucifix, which succeeded to the  simple cross placed on the altars of the Anglo-Saxon churches; a  pair[180-*] of candlesticks, generally with spikes instead of sockets, on  which lights or tapers were fixed; a pix, in which the host was kept  reserved for the sick; a pair of cruets, of metal, in which were contained  the wine and water preparatory to their admixture in the eucharistic cup;  a sacring bell; a pax table, of silver or other metal, for the kiss of  peace, which took place shortly before the host was received in communion;  a stoup or stok, of metal, with a sprinkle for holy water; a censer or  thurible[181-*], and a ship, (a vessel so called,) to hold frankincense; a  chrismatory[181-+], an offering basin, a basin which was used when the  priest washed his hands, and a chalice and paten. Costly specimens of the  ancient pix, containing small patens for the reception of the host, are  preserved amongst the plate belonging to New College and Corpus Christi  College, Oxford. A pix of a much plainer description, but without its  cover, of the metal called latten, was until recently preserved in the  church of Enstone, Oxfordshire: the body of this was of a semi-globular  form, supported on an angular stem, with a knob in the midst, and in  appearance not unlike a chalice. The monstrance, in which the host was  exhibited to the people, and which has been sometimes confounded with the  pix[182-*], does not appear to have been introduced into our churches  before the fifteenth century; on the suppression of the monasteries and  chantries we find it noticed in the inventories then taken of church  furniture, as in that of the Priory of Ely, where it is called \"a stonding  monstral for the sacrament;\" and in that of St. Augustine's Monastery,  Canterbury, where it is described as \"one monstrance, silver gilt, with  four glasses.\"    [Illustration: Sedilia, Crick Church, Northamptonshire.]    Near the high altar we frequently find, in the south wall of the chancel,  a series of stone seats, sometimes without but generally beneath plain or  enriched arched canopies, often supported by slender piers which serve to  divide the seats. In most instances these seats are three in number, but  they vary from one to five, and are the _sedilia_ or seats formerly  appropriated during high mass to the use of the officiating priest and his  attendant ministers, the deacon and sub-deacon, who retired thither  during the chanting of the _Gloria in excelsis_, and some other parts of  the service[183-*]. The sedilia sometimes preserve the same level, but  generally they graduate or rise one above another, and that nearest the  altar, being the highest, was occupied by the priest; the other two by the  deacon and sub-deacon in succession[183-+]. We do not often meet with  sedilia of so early an era as the twelfth century; there are, however,  instances of such, as in the church of St. Mary, at Leicester, where is a  fine Norman triple sedile, divided into graduating seats by double  cylindrical piers with sculptured capitals, and the recessed arches they  support are enriched on the face with a profusion of the zigzag moulding.  In the south wall of the choir of Broadwater Church, Sussex, is a stone  bench beneath a large semicircular Norman arch, the face of which is  enriched with the chevron or zigzag moulding. In Avington Church,  Berkshire, is a stone beneath a plain segmental arch. Norman sedilia also  occur in the churches of Earls Barton, Northamptonshire, and of  Wellingore, Lincolnshire. From the commencement of the thirteenth century  up to the Reformation sedilia became a common appendage to a church, and  the styles are easily distinguished by their peculiar architectonic  features. Some are without canopies, and are excessively plain. On the  south side of the chancel of Minster Lovel Church, Oxfordshire, is a  stone bench without a canopy or division, and plain stone benches thus  disposed are found in the chancel of Bloxham Church, Oxfordshire, and of  Rowington Church, Warwickshire. In Sedgeberrow Church, Gloucestershire,  are two sedilia without canopies; and in Standlake Church, Oxfordshire,  the sedilia, three in number, are without canopies or ornament. In  Spratten Church, Northamptonshire, is a stone bench for three persons  under a plain recessed pointed arch. In Priors Hardwick Church,  Warwickshire, is a sedile for the priest,"]]]
