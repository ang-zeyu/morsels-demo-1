Martin del Rio states 500 were executed in Geneva in  the short space of three months in 1515; and during the next  five years 40 were burned at Ravensburgh. Great numbers suffered  in France at the same period. At Calahorra, in Spain, in 1507,  a vast _auto-da-fe_ was exhibited, when 39 women, denounced  as sorceresses, were committed to the flames--religious  carnage attested by the unsuspected evidence of the judges and  executioners themselves.      [76] Hutchinson's _Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft_,    chap ii.    It is opportune here to examine the common beliefs of demonology  and sorcery as they existed in Europe. Christian demonology is a  confused mixture of pagan, Oriental, and Christian ideas. The  Christian Scriptures have seemed to suggest and sanction a  constant personal interference of the 'great adversary,' who is  always traversing the earth 'seeking whom he may devour;' and his  popular figure is represented as a union of the great dragon,  the satyrs, and fauns. Nor does he often appear without one or  other of his recognised marks--the cloven foot, the goat's  horns, beard, and legs, or the dragon's tail. With young and  good-looking witches he is careful to assume the recommendations  of a young and handsome man, whilst it is not worth while to  disguise so unprepossessing peculiarities in his incarnate  manifestations to _old_ women, the enjoyment of whose souls is  the great purpose of seduction.    Sir Thomas Browne ('Vulgar Errors'), a man of much learning and  still more superstitious fancy, speciously explains the  phenomenon of the cloven foot. He suggests that 'the ground of  this opinion at first might be his frequent appearing in the  shape of a goat, which answers this description. This was the  opinion of the ancient Christians concerning the apparitions of  _panites_, fauns, and satyrs: and of this form we read of one  that appeared to Anthony in the wilderness. The same is also  confirmed from exposition of Holy Scripture. For whereas it is  said \"Thou shalt not offer unto devils,\" the original word is  _Seghuirim_, i. e. rough and hairy goats; because in that shape  the devil most often appeared, as is expounded by the rabbins, as  Tremellius hath also explained; and as the word _Ascimah_, the  God of Emath, is by some explained.' Dr. Joseph Mede, a pious and  learned divine, author of the esteemed 'Key to the Apocalypse,'  pronounces that 'the devil could not appear in human shape while  man was in his integrity, because he was a spirit fallen from his  first glorious perfection, and therefore must appear in such  shape which might argue his imperfection and abasement, which was  the shape of a beast; otherwise [he plausibly contends] no reason  can be given why he should not rather have appeared to Eve in the  shape of a woman than of a serpent. But since the fall of man the  case is altered; now we know he can take upon him the shape of a  man. He appears in the shape of man's imperfection rather for age  or deformity, as like an old man (for so the witches say); and,  perhaps, it is not altogether false, which is vulgarly affirmed,  that the devil appearing in human shape has always a deformity  of some uncouth member or other, as though he could not yet take  upon him human shape entirely, for that man is not entirely and  utterly fallen as he is.' Whatever form he may assume, the  cloven foot must always be visible under every disguise; and  Othello looks first for that fabulous but certain sign when he  scrutinises his treacherous friend.    Reginald Scot's reminiscences of what was instilled into him in  the nursery may possibly occur to some even at this day. 'In our  childhood,' he complains, 'our mothers' maids have so terrified  us with an ugly devil having horns on his head, fire in his  mouth, a tail in his breech, eyes like a bison, fangs like a dog,  a skin like a _niger_, a voice roaring like a lion, whereby we  start and are afraid when we hear one cry Boh!' Chaucer has  expressed the belief of his age on the subject. It seems to have  been a proper duty of a parish priest to bring to the notice of  his ecclesiastical superior, with other crimes, those of sorcery.  The Friar describes his 'Erchedeken' as one--        That boldely didde execucioun      In punyschying of fornicacioun,      Of wicchecraft....    This ecclesiastic employed in his service a subordinate  'sompnour,' who, in the course of his official duty, one day  meets a devil, whose 'dwellynge is in Helle,' who condescends to  enlighten the officer on the dark subject of demon-apparitions:--        When us liketh we can take us on      Or ellis make you seme that we ben schape      Som tyme like a man or like an ape;      Or like an aungel can I ryde or go:      It is no wonder thing though it be so,      A lowsy jogelour can deceyve the;      And, parfay, yet can I more craft than he.    To the question why they are not satisfied with _one_ shape for  all occasions, the devil answers at length:--        Som tyme we ben Goddis instrumentes      And menes to don his commandementes,      Whan that him liste, upon his creatures      In divers act and in divers figures.      Withouten him we have no might certayne      If that him liste to stonden ther agayne.      And som tyme at our prayer, have we leve      Only the body and not the soule greve;      Witnesse on Job, whom we didde ful wo.      And som tyme have we might on bothe two,      That is to say of body and soule eeke      And som tyme be we suffred for to seeke      Upon a man and don his soule unrest      And not his body, and al is for the best.      Whan he withstandeth our temptacioun      It is a cause of his savacioun.      Al be it so it was naught our entente      He schuld be sauf, but that we wolde him hente.      And som tyme we ben servaunt unto man      As to the Erchebisschop Saynt Dunstan;      And to the Apostolis servaunt was I.        *       *       *       *       *        Som tyme we fegn, and som tyme we ryse      With dede bodies, in ful wonder wyse,      And speke renably, and as fayre and wel      As to the Phitonissa dede Samuel:      And yit wil som men say, it was not he.      I do no fors of your divinitie.[77]      [77] _Canterbury Tales._ T. Wright's Text. Chaucer, the    English Boccaccio in verse, attacks alike with his sarcasms    the Church and the female sex.    Jewish theology, expanded by their leading divines, includes a  formidable array of various demons; and the whole of nature in  Christian belief was peopled with every kind        'Of those demons that are found       In fire, air, flood, or under ground.'    Various opinions have been held concerning the nature of devils  and demons. Some have maintained, with Tertullian, that they are  'the souls of baser men.' It is a disputed question whether they  are mortal or immortal; subject to, or free from, pain. 'Psellus,  a Christian, and sometime tutor to Michael Pompinatius, Emperor  of Greece, a great observer of the nature of devils, holds they  are corporeal, and live and die: ... that they feel pain if they  be hurt (which Cardan confirms, and Scaliger justly laughs him to  scorn for); and if their bodies be cut, with admirable celerity  they come together again. Austin approves as much; so doth  Hierome, Origen, Tertullian, Lactantius, and many eminent fathers  of the Church; that in their fall their bodies were changed into  a more aerial and gross substance.' The Platonists and some  rabbis, Porphyrius, Plutarch, Zosimus, &c., hold this opinion,  which is scornfully denied by some others, who assert that they  only deceive the eyes of men, effecting no real change. Cardan  believes 'they feed on men's souls, and so [a worthy origin]  belike that we have so many battles fought in all ages,  countries, is to make them a feast and their sole delight: but if  displeased they fret and chafe (for they feed belike on the souls  of beasts, as we do on their bodies) and send many plagues  amongst us.'    Their exact numbers and orders are differently estimated by  different authorities. It is certain that they fill the air, the  earth, the water, as well as the subterranean globe. The air,  according to Paracelsus, is not so full of flies in summer as it  is at all times of invisible devils. Some writers, professing to  follow Socrates and Plato, determine nine sorts. Whatever or  wherever the supralunary may be, our world is more interested in  the sublunary tribes. These are variously divided and subdivided.  One authority computes six distinct kinds--Fiery, Aerial,  Terrestrial, Watery, Subterranean and Central: these last  inhabiting the central regions of the interior of the earth. The  Fiery are those that work 'by blazing stars, fire-drakes; they  counterfeit suns and moons, stars oftentimes. The Aerial live,  for the most part, in the air, cause many tempests, thunder and  lightning, tear oaks, fire steeples, houses; strike men and  beasts; make it rain stones, as in Livy's time, wool, frogs, &c.;  counterfeit armies in the air, strange noises ... all which Guil.  Postellus useth as an argument (as, indeed, it is) to persuade  them that will not believe there be spirits or devils. They  cause whirlwinds on a sudden and tempestuous storms, which,  though our meteorologists generally refer to natural causes, yet  I am of Bodine's mind, they are more often caused by those aerial  devils in their several quarters; for they ride on the storms as  when a desperate man makes away with himself, which, by hanging  or drowning, they frequently do, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829"],[0,"No Animal Food; and Nutrition and Diet; with Vegetable Recipes (#17)"],[1,"our, 4 ozs. sugar, 4 ozs.
