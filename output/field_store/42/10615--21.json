We have seen what young Japan, against all odds, has been able to  accomplish in a few years. All the more should a talented race like the  Persians, situated to begin with in a far less remote position than  Japan, and therefore more favourably for the acquisition of foreign ways,  be able to emulate, and even in a short time surpass, the marvellous  success attained by the little Islanders of the Far East.    It is grit that is at present lacking in Persia. The country has a  wavering policy that is extremely injurious to her interests. One cannot  fail to compare her to a good old ship in a dangerous sea. The men at her  helm are perplexed, and cannot quite see a clear way of steering. The  waves run high and there are plenty of reefs and rocks about. A black  gloomy sky closes the horizon, forecasting an approaching cyclone. The  ship is leaking on all sides, and the masts are unsteady; yet when we  look at the number of rocks and reefs and dangers which she has steered  clear through already, we cannot fail to have some confidence in her  captain and crew. Maybe, if she is able to resist the fast-approaching  and unavoidable clash of the wind and sea (figuratively England is the  full-blown wind, Russia the sea)--she may yet reach her destination,  swamped by the waves, dismantled, but not beyond repair. Her damage, if  one looks at her with the eye of an expert, is after all not so great,  and with little present trouble and expense she will soon be as good as  new. Not, however, if she is left to rot much longer.    Such is Persia at present. The time has come when she must go back into  the shelter of a safe harbour, or face the storm.          CHAPTER XII         The Persian army--The Persian soldier as he is and as he might       be--When and how he is drilled--Self-doctoring under       difficulties--Misappropriation of the army's salary--Cossack       regiments drilled by Russian officers--Death of the Head       Mullah--Tribute of the Jews--The position of Europeans--A gas       company--How it fulfilled its agreement.      A painful sight is the Persian army. With the exception of the good  Cossack cavalry regiment, properly fed, dressed, armed and drilled by  foreign instructors such as General Kossackowski, and Russian officers,  the infantry and artillery are a wretched lot. There is no excuse for  their being so wretched, because there is hardly a people in Asia who  would make better soldiers than the Persians if they were properly  trained. The Persian is a careless, easy-going devil, who can live on  next to nothing; he is a good marksman, a splendid walker and horseman.  He is fond of killing, and cares little if he is killed--and he is a  master at taking cover. These are all good qualities in a soldier, and if  they were brought out and cultivated; if the soldiers were punctually  paid and fed and clothed and armed, there is no reason why Persia should  not have as good an army as any other nation. The material is there and  is unusually good; it only remains to use it properly.    [Illustration: Persian Soldiers--The Band.]    [Illustration: Recruits Learning Music.]    I was most anxious to see the troops at drill, and asked a very high  military officer when I might see them.    \"We do not drill in summer,\" was the reply, \"it is too hot!\"    \"Do you drill in winter?\"    \"No, it is too cold.\"    \"Are the troops then only drilled in the autumn and spring?\"    \"Sometimes. They are principally drilled a few days before the Shah's  birthday, so that they may look well on the parade before his Majesty.\"    \"I suppose they are also only dressed and shod on the Shah's birthday?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What type and calibre rifle is used in the Persian army?\"    \"Make it plural, as plural as you can. They have every type under the  sun. But,\" added the high military officer, \"we use of course 'bullet  rifles' (_fusils a balle_) not 'small shot guns'!\"    This \"highly technical explanation\" about finished me up.    As luck or ill-luck would have it, I had an accident which detained me  some four weeks in Teheran. While at the Resht hotel, it may be  remembered how, walking barefooted on the matting of my room, an  invisible germ bored its way into the sole of my foot, and I could not  get it out again. One day, in attempting to make its life as lively as  the brute made my foot, I proceeded to pour some drops of concentrated  carbolic acid upon the home of my invisible tenant. Unluckily, in the  operation my arm caught in the blankets of my bed, and in the jerk the  whole contents of the bottle flowed out, severely burning all my toes and  the lower and upper part of my foot, upon which the acid had quickly  dripped between the toes.    With the intense heat of Teheran, this became a very bad sore, and I was  unable to stand up for several days. Some ten days later, having gone for  a drive to get a little air, a carriage coming full gallop from a side  street ran into mine, turning it over, and I was thrown, injuring my leg  very badly again; so with all these accidents I was detained in Teheran  long enough to witness the Shah's birthday, and with it, for a few days  previous, the \"actual drilling of the troops.\"    I have heard it said, but will not be responsible for the statement, that  the troops are nearer their full complement on such an auspicious  occasion than at any other time of the year, so as to make a \"show\"  before his Majesty. Very likely this is true. When I was in Teheran a  great commotion took place, which shows how things are occasionally done  in the land of Iran. The ex-Minister of War, Kawam-ed-douleh, who had  previously been several times Governor of Teheran, was arrested, by order  of the Shah, for embezzling a half year's pay of the whole Persian army.  Soldiers were sent to his country residence and the old man, tied on a  white mule, was dragged into Teheran. His cap having been knocked  off--it is a disgrace to be seen in public without a hat--his relations  asked that he should be given a cap, which concession was granted, on  payment of several hundred tomans. A meal of rice is said to have cost  the prisoner a few more hundred tomans, and so much salt had purposely  been mixed with it that the thirsty ex-Minister had to ask for copious  libations of water, each tumbler at hundreds of tomans.    Several other high officials were arrested in connection with these army  frauds, and would probably have lost their heads, had it not been for the  special kindness of the Shah who punished them by heavy fines, repayment  of the sums appropriated, and exile. It is a well-known fact in Persia  that whether the frauds begin high up or lower down in the scale of  officials, the pay often does not reach the private soldier, and if it  does is generally reduced to a minimum.    The food rations, too, if received by the men at all, are most irregular,  which compels the soldiers to look out for themselves at the expense of  the general public. This is a very great pity, for with what the Shah  pays for the maintenance of the army, he could easily, were the money not  appropriated for other purposes, keep quite an efficient little force,  properly instructed, clothed, and armed.    The drilling of the soldiers, which I witnessed just before the Shah's  birthday, partook very much of the character of a theatrical performance.  The drilling, which hardly ever lasted more than a couple of hours a day,  was limited to teaching the soldiers how to keep time while marching and  presenting arms. The brass bands played _fortissimo_--but not  _benissimo_--all the time, and various evolutions were gone through in  the spacious _place d'armes_ before the Italian General, in Persian  employ, and a bevy of highly-dressed Persian officers. There was a great  variety of ragged uniforms, and head-gears, from kolah caps to brass and  tin helmets, and the soldiers' ages ranged from ten to sixty.    The soldiers seemed very good-humoured and obedient, and certainly, when  I saw them later before the Shah in their new uniforms, they looked quite  different and had not the wretched appearance they present in daily life.    But these infantry soldiers do not bear comparison with the  Russian-drilled Persian Cossacks. The jump is enormous, and well shows  what can be done with these men if method and discipline are used. Of  course perfection could not be expected in such a short time, especially  considering the difficulties and interference which foreign officers have  to bear from the Persians, but it is certainly to be regretted that such  excellent material is now practically wasted and useless.    There were several other excitements before I left Teheran. The head  Mullah--a most important person--died, and the whole population of  Teheran turned out to do him honour when his imposing funeral took place.  Curiously enough, the entire male Jewish community marched in the funeral  procession--an event unprecedented, I am told, in the annals of Persian  Mussulman history. The head Mullah, a man of great wisdom and justice,  had, it was said, been very considerate towards the Jews and had  protected them against persecution: hence this mark of respect and grief  at his death.    The discovery of the ex-Minister of War's frauds, the death of the head  Mullah, the reported secret attempts to poison the Shah, the prospects of  a drought, the reported murder of two Russians at Resht, and other minor  sources of discontent, all coming together, gave rise to fears on the  part of Europeans that a revolution might take place in Teheran. But such  rumours are so very frequent in all Eastern countries that generally no  one attaches any importance to them until it is too late. Europeans are  rather tolerated than loved in Persia, and a walk through the native  streets or bazaars in Teheran is quite sufficient to convince one of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22125"],[0,"The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance (#17)"],[1," Christ and the Adulteress.
