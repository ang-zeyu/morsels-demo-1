He must have had a steady hand at a trigger  who could have got a shot off half as fast.    'I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's,' whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands,  and splitting with a laugh. 'He shan't know who sends it. It's twice the  size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to  Bob's will be!'    The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one; but write  it he did, somehow, and went downstairs to open the street-door, ready  for the coming of the poulterer's man. As he stood there, waiting his  arrival, the knocker caught his eye.    'I shall love it as long as I live!' cried Scrooge, patting it with his  hand. 'I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it  has in its face! It's a wonderful knocker!--Here's the turkey. Hallo!  Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!'    It _was_ a turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird.  He would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of  sealing-wax.    'Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,' said Scrooge. 'You  must have a cab.'    The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid  for the turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the  chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by  the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and  chuckled till he cried.    Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;  and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are  at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a  piece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.    He dressed himself 'all in his best,' and at last got out into the  streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them  with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walking with his hands behind  him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile. He looked so  irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured  fellows said, 'Good-morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!' And Scrooge  said often afterwards that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,  those were the blithest in his ears.    He had not gone far when, coming on towards him, he beheld the portly  gentleman who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and  said, 'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?' It sent a pang across his heart  to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but  he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.    'My dear sir,' said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old  gentleman by both his hands, 'how do you do? I hope you succeeded  yesterday. It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!'    'Mr. Scrooge?'    'Yes,' said Scrooge. 'That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant  to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness----'  Here Scrooge whispered in his ear.    'Lord bless me!' cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away.  'My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?'    'If you please,' said Scrooge. 'Not a farthing less. A great many  back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that  favour?'    'My dear sir,' said the other, shaking hands with him, 'I don't know  what to say to such munifi----'    'Don't say anything, please,' retorted Scrooge. 'Come and see me. Will  you come and see me?'    'I will!' cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it.    'Thankee,' said Scrooge. 'I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty  times. Bless you!'    He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people  hurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned  beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the  windows; and found that everything could yield him pleasure. He had  never dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much  happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's  house.    He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and  knock. But he made a dash and did it.    'Is your master at home, my dear?' said Scrooge to the girl. 'Nice girl!  Very.'    'Yes, sir.'    'Where is he, my love?' said Scrooge.    'He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you  upstairs, if you please.'    'Thankee. He knows me,' said Scrooge, with his hand already on the  dining-room lock. 'I'll go in here, my dear.'    He turned it gently, and sidled his face in round the door. They were  looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these  young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see  that everything is right.    'Fred!' said Scrooge.    Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had  forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the  footstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.    'Why, bless my soul!' cried Fred, 'who's that?'    [Illustration: _\"It's I, your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will  you let me in, Fred?\"_]    'It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,  Fred?'    Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off. He was at home in  five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same.  So did Topper when _he_ came. So did the plump sister when _she_ came.  So did every one when _they_ came. Wonderful party, wonderful games,  wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!    But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there! If  he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That  was the thing he had set his heart upon.    And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter  past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.  Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the  tank.    His hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on  his stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to  overtake nine o'clock.    'Hallo!' growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could  feign it. 'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?'    'I am very sorry, sir,' said Bob. 'I _am_ behind my time.'    'You are!' repeated Scrooge. 'Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir,  if you please.'    'It's only once a year, sir,' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. 'It  shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.'    'Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,' said Scrooge. 'I am not going to  stand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore,' he continued,  leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that  he staggered back into the tank again--'and therefore I am about to  raise your salary!'    Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary  idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the  people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.    'A merry Christmas, Bob!' said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could  not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. 'A merrier Christmas,  Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise  your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will  discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of  smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle  before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!'    [Illustration: _\"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge. \"I  am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.\"_]    Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;  and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as  good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old  City knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old  world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them  laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that  nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did  not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as  these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they  should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less  attractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for  him.    He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the  Total-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of  him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed  the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as  Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!

Great were the rejoicings of the Chaddites at their triumph over St.  Hilary's. Something in the way of a celebration seemed necessary to  immortalize the occasion, and that evening, after a hurried conference  among the elder girls, it was given out that, with Miss Maitland's  permission, an impromptu fancy-dress ball would take place in the  recreation room at 8.30 precisely.    \"We're just to come in any kind of costumes we can manage to contrive,\"  said Lettice Talbot, who, wild with excitement, had carried the  thrilling tidings to the younger contingent. \"Miss Maitland is going to  dress up, and so is Miss Parkinson. The cook is making some lemonade; I  hope it will be cold in time, but even if it isn't it will be rather  nice hot. Oh, would you advise me to go as a flower-girl, or do you  think Queen Elizabeth would be better?\"    \"I should suggest a Merry-andrew at the present moment,\" said Ruth  Latimer, as Lettice, unable to contain her glee, went hopping round the  room. \"You could easily put a different coloured stocking on each leg,  cut sheets of tissue paper to make a short, frilled, sticking-out  skirt, borrow the toasting-fork from the kitchen and hang it with  ribbons for your bauble, and there you are!\"    \"Jolly!\" exclaimed Lettice. \"I'll do it. Will you lend me your scarlet  sponge-bag? It would make the very cap I want.\"    It was fortunate that Vivian Holmes and her fellow-workers had reserved  the announcement of the proposed fete until after preparation,  otherwise very few lessons would have been learnt at St. Chad's. The  girls finished supper with record speed, and filed out of the  dining-hall at least ten minutes earlier than usual, all anxious to  flee upstairs and begin the delightful but arduous task of robing  themselves in character.    Miss Maitland was the owner of what she called a \"theatrical  property-box\". It held a store of most invaluable possessions, which  she had collected from time to time and put by to serve for charades or  tableaux. There were old evening dresses and cloaks, feathers, shawls,  a few hats, artificial flowers, bright-coloured scarves, beads,  bangles, and cracker jewellery, even some false moustaches and beards,  a horse pistol, and a pair of top-boots. These she placed entirely at  the disposal of the girls, telling Vivian Holmes to distribute them so  as to allow as many as possible to have a share. Vivian was strictly  impartial, and doled out the treasures with the stern justice of a  Roman tribune. They did not go very far, however, among forty  Chaddites; so, of necessity, at least half of the costumes had to be  composed hastily of anything that came to hand.    The apparelling was a lively process, to judge from the sounds of mirth  that issued from the various cubicles; and so many different articles  were borrowed, lent, and exchanged that it was a wonder their  respective owners ever managed to claim them again. Strict secrecy was  observed, the occupants of each bedroom denying even a peep to their  next-door neighbours, who, though full of their own preparations, could  not fail to exhibit curiosity when such exclamations as, \"Oh, how  lovely!\" or, \"It's simply screaming!\" were wafted down the passage.    Nowhere was the excitement keener than in No. 8, though Honor and Janie  had the fun all to themselves. The latter had decided to go as a friar.  She had contrived a capital monk's habit out of her waterproof, tied  round the waist with the cord that held back the window curtains. The  hood formed the cowl, a dictionary made a very passable breviary, and a  hockey stick served as a pilgrim's staff.    \"You're just like a palmer returning from the Holy Land,\" declared  Honor.    \"Or the 'Friar of Orders Grey',\" said Janie, \"who--        \"'Walked forth to tell his beads,      And he met with a lady fair      Clad in a pilgrim's weeds!'    \"I ought to have a rosary, but there isn't anything that would do in  the least for it.\"    \"Never mind! One must imagine it is in your pocket. Even palmers  couldn't tell their beads all day long. You look a most unsuitable  figure to dance! I'm afraid they would turn you out of your monastery,  if they caught you.\"    Honor was determined to enact the part of Dick Turpin. She had corked  herself the most ferocious moustaches, and made a cocked hat out of  brown paper; and was now only waiting for a certain cloak, the horse  pistol, and the pair of top-boots, which Vivian had promised to bring  her if Barbara Russell, one of the elder girls, did not want them.    \"I heard Barbara say she meant to be a shepherdess,\" she said, \"so she  couldn't possibly wear top-boots. I don't believe anybody else has  thought of a highwayman. I wish Vivian would be quick!\"    She was in a ferment of excitement. A festivity such as this was an  event in her life. She could hardly bear to wait, and would have been  down the passage in search of the missing properties, only she did not  wish to exhibit her beautiful moustaches before the right time.    \"Vivian won't be long,\" Janie assured her. \"She is the most dependable  person I know; when she says she'll do a thing, she does it. Oh, here  she is now!\"    Honor sprang to the door, but her face fell as she saw the monitress  arrive empty-handed.    \"I'm dreadfully sorry!\" announced Vivian. \"Barbara decided, after all,  to be Oliver Cromwell, so of course she wanted the cloak, boots, and  pistol. I've brought you a few bangles and a wreath of flowers, if  they'll be of any use to you; I've nothing else left. I must fly! I've  to get into my own costume.\"    Poor Honor! It was a bitter disappointment. She had counted so much on  representing Dick Turpin that to have to forgo the part seemed little  short of a tragedy.    \"I can't do a highwayman in nothing but a pair of corked moustaches!\"  she exclaimed dolefully.    \"It is a pity,\" sympathized Janie, \"but of course it can't be helped.  If we're very quick we shall just have time to think of something else.  Could you manage a fairy, with the bangles and the wreath and a white  petticoat?\"    \"A fairy! No! Do I look like a fairy? I'm so cross, it would have to be  a goblin. I know what I'll do; I shall go as an Arab.\"    \"With the towels wound round you, I suppose?\"    \"They're not big enough; I must use my sheets,\" and Honor, suiting her  action to her words, ruthlessly disarranged her bed.    If the towels were too small, the sheets proved too large. In spite of  Janie's efforts (much hampered by her cassock and cowl) they refused to  drape elegantly. Honor lost all patience at last, and, seizing her  scissors, ripped the offending sheets in halves with uncompromising  fingers.    \"Oh, Honor, what have you done? How could you? Oh, what will Miss  Maitland say?\" shrieked Janie, almost in tears.    \"I don't care!\" declared Honor recklessly.    In her present excited state she would have torn up her best dress with  equal readiness. She was elated with her success in the cricket  field--what the Scotch call \"fey\"; and so long as she gratified her  present whim, she had no thought at all for the future.    \"I must have some costume,\" she continued, \"and we ought to go  downstairs at once. They're my own sheets, so what does it matter? It  isn't as if they were school property; I brought them from home with  the rest of my linen--they're marked 'H. Fitzgerald' in the corner.\"    \"You'll get into a shocking scrape, all the same,\" said Janie, who was  horror-stricken at her friend's lawlessness.    There was no time, however, to think about consequences. The gong was  giving the signal for the parade to begin, and various gigglings and  exclamations in the passage warned them that the other girls were  already issuing from their rooms. Honor hastily finished her Arab  toilet, and without further delay the pair joined the rest of the  masqueraders in the hall.    Here a brilliant scene awaited them. Considering the scanty materials  at command, quite marvellous results had been accomplished. The  costumes were most gay and varied, and many of them showed extreme  ingenuity on the part of their wearers. Lettice Talbot had carried out  Ruth Latimer's idea for a Merry-andrew with great success, and was  evidently endeavouring to sustain the character by firing off bad puns,  or facetious remarks on the appearance of her friends. Dorothy  Arkwright, in a blue evening dress and a black velvet hat with  feathers, made a dignified Duchess of Devonshire; and Pauline Reynolds,  whose long, golden hair hung below her waist, came arrayed as Fair  Rosamond. There were several Italian peasants, a Cavalier, a Roundhead,  and a matador. Agnes Bennett, one of the elder girls, impersonated the  Pied Piper of Hamelin. By pinning two dressing-gowns (one of red and  one of buff) together, she had well imitated the \"queer long coat from  heel to head, half of yellow and half of red\", worn by the mysterious  stranger; and, with her pipe, hung with ribbons, at her lips, seemed  ready to charm either rats into the Weser, or children into the  hillside. Edith Hammond-Smith was a fairy, and Claudia a pierrot; while  Flossie Taylor, in an Eastern shawl, and with bangles tied on for  ear-rings, looked a gorgeous Cleopatra.    Chatty Burns, in a tartan plaid, made a typical \"Highland lassie\".  Effie Lawson, with her hair plaited in a tight pigtail, and her  eyebrows corked aslant, had, with the aid of a coloured bedspread and a  Japanese umbrella, turned herself into a very creditable \"Heathen  Chinee\"; and Maisie Talbot, who found materials waxing scarce after she  had finished arraying Lettice, had flung a skin rug over her shoulders,  painted her face in streaks of red and black, and come as a savage.  Adeline Vaughan had an original and rather striking costume. "]]]
