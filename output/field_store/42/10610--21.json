A green sheet or cloth is spread over the tomb and  a lamp is kept burning by it, while offerings of incense and flowers  are made. When the new cotton crop has been gathered they lay some  new cotton by their bow and mallet and make an offering of _malida_  or cakes of flour and sugar to it. They believe that two angels, one  good and one bad, are perched continually on the shoulders of every  man to record his good and evil deeds. And when an eclipse occurs they  say that the sun and moon have gone behind a pinnacle or tower of the  heavens. For exorcising evil spirits they write texts of the Koran  on paper and burn them before the sufferer. The caste bury the dead  with the feet pointing to the south. On the way to the grave each  one of the mourners places his shoulder under the bier for a time,  partaking of the impurity communicated by it. Incense is burnt daily  in the name of a deceased person for forty days after his death, with  the object probably of preventing his ghost from returning to haunt  the house. Muhammadan beggars are fed on the tenth day. Similarly,  after the birth of a child a woman is unclean for forty days, and  cannot cook for her husband during that period. A child's hair is  cut for the first time on the tenth or twelfth day after birth, this  being known as Jhalar. Some parents leave a lock of hair to grow on  the head in the name of the famous saint Sheikh Farid, thinking that  they will thus ensure a long life for the child. It is probably in  reality a way of preserving the Hindu _choti_ or scalp-lock.        4. Occupation.      The hereditary calling [83] of the Bahna is the cleaning or scutching  of cotton, which is done by subjecting it to the vibration of a  bow-string. The seed has been previously separated by a hand-gin,  but the ginned cotton still contains much dirt, leaf-fibre and other  rubbish, and to remove this is the Bahna's task. The bow is somewhat  in the shape of a harp, the wide end consisting of a broad piece of  wood over which the string passes, being secured to a straight wooden  bar at the back. At the narrow end the bar and string are fixed to an  iron ring. The string is made of the sinew of some animal, and this  renders the implement objectionable to Hindus, and may account for  the Bahnas being Muhammadans. The club or mallet is a wooden implement  shaped like a dumb-bell. The bow is suspended from the roof so as to  hang just over the pile of loose cotton; and the worker twangs the  string with the mallet and then draws the mallet across the string,  each three or four times. The string strikes a small portion of the  cotton, the fibre of which is scattered by the impact and thrown off  in a uniform condition of soft fluff, all dirt being at the same time  removed. This is the operation technically known as teasing. Buchanan  remarked that women frequently did the work themselves at home, using  a smaller kind of bow called _dhunkara_. The clean cotton is made up  into balls, some of which are passed on to the spinner, while others  are used for the filling of quilts and the padded coats worn in the  cold weather. The ingenious though rather clumsy method of the Bahna  has been superseded by the ginning-factory, and little or no cotton  destined for the spindle is now cleaned by him. The caste have been  forced to take to cultivation or field labour, while many have become  cartmen and others are brokers, peons or constables. Nearly every  house still has its _pinjan_ or bow, but only a desultory use is  made of this during the winter months. As it is principally used by a  Muhammadan caste it seems a possible hypothesis that the cotton-bow  was introduced into India by invaders of that religion. The name of  the bow, _pinjan_, is, however, a Sanskrit derivative, and this is  against the above theory. It has already been seen that the fact of  animal sinew being used for the string would make it objectionable to  Hindus. The Bahnas are subjected to considerable ridicule on account  of their curious mixture of Hindu and Muhammadan ceremonies, amounting  in some respects practically to a caricature of the rites of Islam;  and further, they share with the weaver class the contempt shown to  those who follow a calling considered more suitable for women than  men. It is related that when the Mughal general Asaf Khan first made an  expedition into the north of the Central Provinces he found the famous  Gond-Rajput queen Durgavati of the Garha-Mandla dynasty governing with  success a large and prosperous state in this locality. He thought a  country ruled by a woman should fall an easy prey to the Muhammadan  arms, and to show his contempt for her power he sent her a golden  spindle. The queen retorted by a present of a gold cotton-cleaner's  bow, and this so enraged the Mughal that he proceeded to attack the  Gond kingdom. The story indicates that cotton-carding is considered  a Muhammadan profession, and also that it is held in contempt.        5. Proverbs about Bahnas.      Various sayings show that the Bahna is not considered a proper  Muhammadan, as                      Turuk to Turuk                  Aur Bahna Turuk,      or 'A Muhammadan (Turk) is a Muhammadan and the Bahna is also a  Muhammadan'; and again--                      Achera, [84] Kachera, Pinjara,                  Muhammad se dur, Din se niyara,      or 'The Kachera and Pinjara are lost to Muhammad and far from the  faith'; and again--                      Adho Hindu adho Musalman                  Tinkhon kahen Dhunak Pathan,      or 'Half a Hindu and half a Muhammadan, that is he who is a Dhunak  Pathan.' They have a grotesque imitation of the Muhammadan rite of  _halal_, or causing an animal's blood to flow on to the ground with  the repetition of the _kalma_ or invocation; thus it is said that when  a Bahna is about to kill a fowl he addresses it somewhat as follows:                      Kahe karkarat hai?                  Kahe barbarat hai?                  Kahe jai jai logon ka dana khat hai?                  Tor kiamat mor niamat,                  Bismillah hai tuch,      or \"Why do you cackle? Why do you crow? Why do you eat other people's  grain? Your death is my feast; I touch you in the name of God.\" And  saying this he puts a knife to the fowl's throat. The vernacular verse  is a good imitation of the cackling of a fowl. And again, they slice  off the top of an egg as if they were killing an animal and repeat the  formula, \"White dome, full of moisture, I know not if there is a male  or female within; in the name of God I kill you.\" A person whose memory  is not good enough to retain these texts will take a knife and proceed  to one who knows them. Such a man will repeat the texts over the knife,  blowing on it as he does so, and the Bahna considers that the knife  has been sanctified and retains its virtue for a week. Others do not  think this necessary, but have a special knife, which having once been  consecrated is always kept for killing animals, and descends as an  heirloom in the family, the use of this sacred knife being considered  to make the repetition of the _kalma_ unnecessary. These customs are,  however, practised only by the ignorant members of the caste in Raipur  and Bilaspur, and are unknown in the more civilised tracts, where  the Bahnas are rapidly conforming to ordinary Muhammadan usage. Such  primitive Bahnas perform their marriages by walking round the sacred  post, keep the Hindu festivals, and feed Brahmans on the tenth day  after a death. They have a priest whom they call their Kazi, but elect  him themselves. In some places when a Bahna goes to the well to draw  water he first washes the parapet of the well to make it ceremonially  clean, and then draws his water. This custom can only be compared  with that of the Raj-Gonds who wash the firewood with which they are  about to cook their food, in order to make it more pure. Respectable  Muhammadans naturally look down on the Bahnas, and they retaliate  by refusing to take food or water from any Muhammadan who is not  a Bahna. By such strictness the more ignorant think that they will  enhance their ceremonial purity and hence their social consideration;  but the intelligent members of the caste know better and are glad to  improve themselves by learning from educated Muhammadans. The other  menial artisan castes among the Muhammadans have similar ideas, and  it is reported that a Rangrez boy who took food in the house of one  of the highest Muhammadan officers of Government in the Province was  temporarily put out of caste. Another saying about the Bahnas is--                      Sheikhon ki Sheikhi,                      Pathanon ki tarr,                  Turkon ki Turkshahi,                      Bahnon ki bharrr ...      or 'Proud as a Sheikh, obstinate as a Pathan, royal as a Turk, buzzing  like a Bahna.' This refers to the noise of the cotton-cleaning bow,  the twang of which as it is struck by the club is like a quail flying;  and at the same time to the Bahna's loquacity. Another story is that  a Bahna was once going through the forest with his cotton-cleaning bow  and club or mallet, when a jackal met him on the path. The jackal was  afraid that the Bahna would knock him on the head, so he said, \"With  thy bow on thy shoulder and thine arrow in thy hand, whither goest  thou, O King of Delhi?\" The Bahna was exceedingly pleased at this and  replied, 'King of the forest, eater of wild plums, only the great can  recognise the great.' But when the jackal had got to a safe distance  he turned round and shouted, \"With your cotton-bow on your shoulder and  your club in your hand, there you go, you sorry Bahna.\" It is said also  that although the Bahnas as good Muhammadans wear beards, they do not  cultivate them very successfully, and many of them only have a growth  of hair below the chin and none on the under-lip, in the fashion known  as a goat's beard. This kind of beard is thus "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22042"],[0,"Christmas: Its Origin and Associations (#17)"],[1,"rior-king in partial retirement from public affairs,  and under the influence of his mistress, Alice Perrers, while John of  Gaunt took a leading part in the government of the state. In 1376  Edward the Black Prince died, and the same year King Edward III. kept  his last Christmas at Westminster, the festival being made memorable  by all the nobles of the realm attending to swear fealty to the son of  the Black Prince, who, by the King's desire, took precedence of his  uncles at the banquet as befitted the heir apparent to the crown. The  King died on the 21st of June, 1377, having reigned for just over half  a century.    The old chronicler, Stowe, refers to a      TERRIBLE CHRISTMAS TEMPEST,    which he says occurred in 1362: \"The King held his Christmas at  Windsore, and the XV. day following a sore and vehement south-west  winde brake forth, so hideous that it overthrew high houses, towers,  steeples, and trees, and so bowed them, that the residue which fell  not, but remained standing, were the weaker.\"    King Edward the Third's wardrobe accounts witness to the      COSTLY CHRISTMAS ROBES    that were worn at this period. And these accounts also show that Alice  Perrers was associated with the King's daughter and granddaughter in  the Christmas entertainments. There are items in 1376 stating that the  King's daughter Isabella (styled Countess of Bedford), and her  daughter (afterwards wife of Vere, Earl of Oxford), were provided with  rich garments trimmed with ermine, in the fashion of the robes of the  Garter, and with others of shaggy velvet, trimmed with the same fur,  for the Christmas festival; while articles of apparel equally costly  are registered as sent by the King to his chamber at Shene, to be  given to Alice Perrers. And at a festival at Windsor the King caused  twelve ladies (including his daughters and Alice Perrers) to be  clothed in handsome hunting suits, with ornamented bows and arrows, to  shoot at the King's deer; and a very attractive band of foresters they  made. We have also seen that eighty costly tunics were provided for  the Christmas sports and disguisings at Guildford.    We now come to a      COMICALLY CRUEL CHRISTMAS INCIDENT,    recorded by Sir John Froissart, and which he says gave \"great joye\" to  the hilarious \"knightes and squyers\" who kept the festival with \"the  Erle of Foiz\":--    \"So it was on a Christmas day the Erle of Foiz helde a great feest,  and a plentifull of knightes and squyers, as it is his usage; and it  was a colde day, and the erle dyned in the hall, and with him great  company of lordes; and after dyner he departed out of the hall, and  went up into a galarye of xxiiii stayres of heyght, in which galarye  ther was a great chymney, wherin they made fyre whan therle was ther;  and at that tyme there was but a small fyre, for the erle loved no  great fyre; howbeit, he hadde woode ynoughe there about, and in Bierne  is wode ynoughe. The same daye it was a great frost and very colde:  and when the erle was in the galarye, and saw the fyre so lytell, he  sayde to the knightes and squiers about hym, Sirs, this is but a small  fyre, and the day so colde: than Ernalton of Spayne went downe the  stayres, and beneth in the courte he sawe a great meny of asses, laden  with woode to serve the house: than he went and toke one of the  grettest asses, with all the woode, and layde hym on his backe, and  went up all the stayres into the galary, and dyde cast downe the asse  with all the woode into the chymney, and the asses fete upward;  wherof the erle of Foiz had great joye, and so hadde all they that  were there, and had marveyle of his strength howe he alone came up all  the stayres with the asse and the woode in his necke.\"    [Illustration]    Passing on to      THE REIGN OF RICHARD THE SECOND,    the son of Edward the Black Prince and Joan of Kent, who came to the  throne (in tutelage) on the death of his grandfather, Edward III.  (1377), we find that costly banquetings, disguisings, pageants, and  plays continued to be the diversions of Christmastide at court. From  the rolls of the royal wardrobe, it appears that at the Christmas  festival in 1391, the sages of the law were made subjects for  disguisements, this entry being made: \"Pro XXI _coifs_ de tela linea  pro hominibus de lege contrafactis pro Ludo regis tempore natalis  Domini anno XII.\" That is, for twenty-one linen coifs for  counterfeiting men of the law in the King's play at Christmas. And  Strutt[25] says that in the same year (1391) the parish clerks of  London put forth a play at Skinners' Wells, near Smithfield, which  continued three days: the king, queen, and many of the nobility, being  present at the performance.    [Illustration: [On one side is the legend, MONETA NOVA ADRIANI  STVLTORV PAPE, the last E being in the field of the piece, on which is  represented the Pope, with his double cross and tiara, with a fool in  full costume approaching his bauble to the pontifical cross, and two  persons behind, who form part of his escort. On the reverse is a  \"mother fool,\" with her bauble, attended by a grotesque person with a  cardinal's hat, with the oft-recurring legend, STVLTORV INFINITVS EST  NVMERVS.]]    But the miracle plays and mysteries performed by the Churchmen  differed greatly from the secular plays and interludes which at this  period \"were acted by strolling companies of minstrels, jugglers,  tumblers, dancers, bourdours, or jesters, and other performers  properly qualified for the different parts of the entertainment, which  admitted of a variety of exhibitions. These pastimes are of higher  antiquity than the ecclesiastical plays; and they were much relished  not only by the vulgar part of the people, but also by the nobility.  The courts of the kings of England, and the castles of the great earls  and barons, were crowded with the performers of the secular plays,  where they were well received and handsomely rewarded; vast sums of  money were lavishly bestowed upon these secular itinerants, which  induced the monks and other ecclesiastics to turn actors themselves,  in order to obtain a share of the public bounty. But to give the  better colouring to their undertaking, they took the subjects of their  dialogues from the holy writ, and performed them in the churches. The  secular showmen, however, retained their popularity notwithstanding  the exertions of their clerical rivals, who diligently endeavoured to  bring them into disgrace, by bitterly inveighing against the  filthiness and immorality of their exhibitions. On the other hand, the  itinerant players sometimes invaded the province of the churchmen, and  performed their mysteries, or others similar to them, as we find from  a petition presented to Richard II. by the scholars of St. Paul's  School, wherein complaint is made against the secular actors, because  they took upon themselves to act plays composed from the Scripture  history, to the great prejudice of the clergy, who had been at much  expense to prepare such performances for public exhibition at the  festival of Christmas.\"    [Illustration: A COURT FOOL.]    In his Christmas feasts Richard the Second outdid his predecessors in  prodigal hospitality. He delighted in the neighbourhood of Eltham,  and spent much of his time in feasting with his favourites at the  royal palace there. In 1386 (notwithstanding the still prevalent  distress, which had continued from the time of the peasant revolt)  Richard kept the Christmas festivities at Eltham with great  extravagance, at the same time entertaining Leon, King of Armenia, in  a manner utterly unjustified by the state of the royal exchequer,  which had been replenished by illegal methods. And, on the completion  of his enlargements and embellishments of Westminster Hall, Richard  reopened it with \"a most royal Christmas feast\" of twenty-eight oxen  and three hundred sheep, and game and fowls without number, feeding  ten thousand guests for many days. Yet but a few years afterwards  (such is the fickleness of fortune and the instability of human  affairs) this same king, who had seen the \"Merciless Parliament,\" who  had robbed Hereford of his estates, who had been robed in cloth of  gold and precious stones, and who had alienated his subjects by his  own extravagance, was himself deposed and sentenced to lifelong  banishment, his doom being pronounced in the very hall which he had  reared to such magnificence for his own glory. Thus ingloriously  Richard disappears from history, for nothing certain is known of the  time, manner, or place of his death, though it is conjectured that he  was speedily murdered. How history repeats itself! Richard's  ignominious end recalls to mind the verse in which an English poet  depicts the end of an Eastern king who was too fond of revelling:--     \"That night they slew him on his father's throne,    The deed unnoticed and the hand unknown:    Crownless and sceptreless Belshazzar lay,    A robe of purple round a form of clay!\"    [Illustration]      GRAND CHRISTMAS TOURNAMENT.    An example of the tournaments which were favourite diversions of kings  and nobles at this period is found in that held at Christmastide in  London in 1389. Richard II., his three uncles, and the greater barons  having heard of a famous tournament at Paris at the entry of Isabel,  Queen of France, resolved to hold one of equal splendour at London, in  which sixty English knights, conducted to the scene of action by sixty  ladies, should challenge all foreign knights. They therefore sent  heralds into all parts of England, Scotland, Germany, Italy, Flanders,  Brabant, Hainault, and France to proclaim the time, place, and other  circumstances of the proposed gathering, and to invite all valorous  knights and squires to honour it with their presence. This, says the  historian, excited a strong desire in the knights and squires of all  these countries to attend to see the manners and equipages of the  English,"]]]
