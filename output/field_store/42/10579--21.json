You had better write  by the next post, if you are bent on doing it.  You can write at my  desk.\"    So saying he departed, leaving me very perplexed and a good deal out of  humour with my wonderful advertisement.    However, I sat down and answered it.  Six of my uncle's sheets of paper  were torn up before I got the first sentence to my satisfaction, and six  more before the letter was done.  I never wrote a letter that cost me  such an agony of labour.  How feverishly I read and re-read what I had  written!  What panics I got into about the spelling of \"situation,\" and  the number of l's in \"ability\"!  How carefully I rubbed out the pencil-  lines I had ruled, and how many times I repented I had not put a \"most\"  before the \"obediently\"!  Many letters like that, thought I, would  shorten my life perceptibly.  At last it was done, and when my uncle  came in I showed it to him with fear and trembling, and watched his face  anxiously as he read it.    \"Humph!\" said he, looking at me, \"and suppose you do get the place, you  won't stick to it.\"    \"Oh yes, I will,\" said I; \"I'll work hard and get on.\"    \"You'd better,\" said my uncle, \"for you'll have only yourself to depend  on.\"    I posted my letter, and the next few days seemed interminable.  Whenever  I spoke about the subject to my uncle he took care not to encourage me  over much.  And yet I fancied, gruff as he was, he was not wholly  displeased at my \"cheek\" in answering Merrett, Barnacle, and Company's  advertisement.    \"Successful!\" growled he.  \"Why, there'll be scores of other boys after  the place.  You don't expect your letter's the best of the lot, do you?  Besides, they'd never have a boy up from the country when there are so  many in London ready for the place, who are used to the work.  Mark my  word, you'll hear no more about it.\"    And so it seemed likely to be.  Day after day went by and the post  brought no letter; I was beginning to think I should have to settle down  as a newspaper-boy or a page after all.    At the end of the week I was so disheartened that I could stay in the  house no longer, but sallied out, I cared not whither, for a day in the  fresh air.    As I was sauntering along the road, a cart overtook me, a covered  baker's cart with the name painted outside, \"Walker, Baker, Packworth.\"    A brilliant idea seized me as I read the legend.  Making a sign to the  youth in charge to stop, I ran up and asked, \"I say, what would you give  me a lift for to Packworth?\"    \"What for?  S'pose we say a fifty-pun' note,\" was the facetious reply.  \"I could do with a fifty-pun' note pretty comfortable.\"    \"Oh, but really, how much?  I want to go to Packworth awfully, but it's  such a long way to walk.\"    \"What do you weigh, eh?\"    \"I don't know; about seven stone, I think.\"    \"If you was eight stun I wouldn't take you, there!  But hop up!\"    And next moment I found myself bowling merrily along in the baker's cart  all among the loaves and flour-bags to Packworth.    My jovial driver seemed glad of a companion, and we soon got on very  good terms, and conversed on a great variety of topics.    Presently, as we seemed to be nearing the town, I ventured to inquire,  \"I say, do you know Jack Smith at Packworth?\"    The Jehu laughed.    \"Know him--old Jack Smith?  Should think I do.\"    \"You do?\" cried I, delighted, springing to my feet and knocking over a  whole pyramid of loaves.  \"Oh, I _am_ glad.  It's him I want to see.\"    \"Is it now?\" said the fellow, \"and what little game have you got on with  him?  Going a grave-diggin', eh?\"    \"Grave-digging, no!\"  I cried.  \"Jack Smith and I were at school  together--\"    The driver interrupted me with a loud laugh.    \"Oh, my eye, that's a good 'un; you at school with old Jack Smith!  Oh,  that'll do, that'll do!\" and he roared with laughter.    \"But I really was,\" repeated I, \"at Stonebridge House.\"    \"You was?  How long before you was born was it; oh my eye, eh?\"    \"It was only last year.\"    \"Last year, and old Jack lost the last tooth out of his head last year  too.\"    \"What! has he had his teeth out?\" cried I, greatly concerned.    \"Yes, and all his hair off since you was at school with him,\" cried my  companion, nearly rolling off the box with laughter.    \"What do you mean?\"  I cried, in utter bewilderment at this catalogue of  my friend's misfortunes.    \"Oh, don't ask me.  Old Jack Smith!\"    \"He's not old,\" said I, \"not very, only about sixteen.\"    This was too much for my driver, who clapped me on the back, and as soon  as he could recover his utterance cried, \"My eyes, you _will_ find him  growed!\"    \"Has he?\" said I, half envious, for I wasn't growing very quickly.    \"Ain't he!  He's growed a lump since you was at school together,\" roared  my eccentric friend.    \"What is he doing?\"  I asked, anxious to hear something more definite of  poor Jack.    \"Oh, the same old game, on'y he goes at it quieter nor he used.  Last  Sunday that there bell-ringing regular blowed him out, the old covey.\"    A light suddenly dawned upon me.    \"Bell-ringing; old covey.  That's not the Jack Smith I mean!\"    \"What!\" roared my companion, \"you don't mean him?\"    \"No, who?\" cried I, utterly bewildered.    \"Why, old Jack Smith, the sexton, what was eighty-two last Christmas!  You wasn't at school with him!  Oh, I say; here, take the reins: I can't  drive straight no longer!\" and he fairly collapsed into the bottom of  the cart.    This little diversion, amusing as it was, did not have the effect of  allaying my anxiety to hear something about my old schoolfellow.    My driver, however, although he knew plenty of Smiths in the town, knew  no one answering to Jack's description; and, now that Packworth was in  sight, I began to feel rather foolish to have come so far on such a  wild-goose chase.    Packworth is a large town with about 40,000 inhabitants; and when,  having bidden farewell to the good-natured baker, I found myself in its  crowded bustling streets, any chance of running against my old chum  seemed very remote indeed.    I went to the post-office where my two letters had been addressed, the  one I wrote a year ago, just after Jack's expulsion, and the other  written last week from Brownstroke.    \"Have you any letters addressed to `J'?\"  I asked.    The clerk fumbled over the contents of a pigeon-hole, from which he  presently drew out my last letter and gave it to me.    \"Wait a bit,\" said he, as I was taking it up, and turning to leave the  office.  \"Wait a bit.\"    He went back to the pigeon-hole, and after another sorting produced,  very dusty and dirty, my first letter.  \"That's for `J' too,\" said he.    Then Jack had never been to Packworth, or got my letter, posted at such  risk.  He must have given me a false address.  Surely, if he lived here,  he would have called for the letter.  Why did he tell me to write to  Post-Office, Packworth, if he never meant to call for my letters?    A feeling of vexation crossed my mind, and mingled with the  disappointment I felt at now being sure my journey here was a hopeless  one.    I wandered about the town a bit, in the vague hope of something turning  up.  But nothing did.  Nothing ever does when a fellow wants it.  So I  turned tail, and faced the prospect of a solitary ten-mile walk back to  Brownstroke.    I felt decidedly down.  This expedition to Packworth had been a  favourite dream of mine for many months past, and somehow I had never  anticipated there would be much difficulty, could I once get there, in  discovering my friend Smith.  But now he seemed more out of reach than  ever.  There were my two neglected letters, never called for, and not a  word from him since the day I left Stonebridge House.  I might as well  give up the idea of ever seeing him again, and certainly spare myself  the trouble of further search after him.    I was walking on, letters in hand, engaged in this sombre train of  thought, when suddenly, on the road before me, I heard a clatter of  hoofs accompanied by a child's shriek.  At the same moment round a  corner appeared a small pony galloping straight towards where I was,  with a little girl clinging wildly round its neck, and uttering the  cries I had heard.    The animal had evidently taken fright and become quite beyond control,  for the reins hung loose, and the little stirrup was flying about in all  directions.    Fortunately, the part of the road where we were was walled on one side,  while the other bank was sloping.  I had not had much practice in  stopping runaway horses, but it occurred to me that if I stood right in  the pony's way, and shouted at him as he came up, he might, what with me  in front and the wall and slope on either side, possibly give himself a  moment for reflection, and so enable me to make a grab at his bridle.    And so it turned out.  I spread out my arms and yelled at him at the top  of my voice, with a vehemence which quite took him aback.  He pulled up  dead just as he reached me, so suddenly, indeed, that the poor child  slipped clean off his back, and then, before he could fling himself  round and continue his bolt in another direction, I had him firmly by  the snaffle.    The little girl, who may have been twelve or thirteen, was not hurt, I  think, by her fall.  But she was dreadfully frightened, and sat crying  so piteously that I began to get quite alarmed.  I tied the pony up to  the nearest tree, and did what I could to relieve the young lady's  tribulation, a task in which I was succeeding very fairly when a female,  the child's nurse, arrived on the scene in a panic.  Of course my little  patient broke out afresh for the benefit of her protectress, and an  affecting scene ensued, in the midst of which, finding I was not wanted,  and feeling a little foolish to be standing by when so much crying and  kissing was going on, I proceeded on my way, half wishing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#17)"],[1,"the rest sprang at the  lion, and was caught by him.  Planting both his front paws on the body  of the unhappy cur, the lion stood for a moment glaring at his foes, and  in that moment Grosvenor pulled trigger, the bullet striking the great  beast full in his massive chest.  For perhaps a quarter of a minute the  lion stood absolutely motionless, his eyes blazing defiance; then he  suddenly collapsed, and, with a half-whine, half-roar, slowly rolled  over on his side, his great head sank to earth, his limbs stretched  themselves stiffly out, and with a violent shudder he yielded up his  life.    Grosvenor chose this moment to inject a fresh cartridge into the chamber  of his rifle.  But something went wrong with the weapon, and while he  was still fidgeting with it, forgetful of the fact that Jantje was  standing behind him with a second rifle, fully charged, in his hand, the  lioness, with a mighty, snarling roar that sent the dogs scuttling in  all directions, crouched with the evident intention of springing upon  the slayer of her lord.  For a moment Dick, who was interestedly  watching the scene, took no action, for, according to the arrangement  come to between them, the lioness belonged of right to Grosvenor.  Then,  realising that his friend was in peril, he shouted excitedly:    \"Shoot, Phil, shoot, or the brute will be upon you!\" at the same time  lifting his own weapon to his shoulder.    \"Can't,\" returned Grosvenor, still struggling with his rifle; \"the  beastly thing's--\"    Crack!  Dick instantly pressed the trigger; and as he did so the lioness  rose into the air with a curious writhing movement, falling short of the  spot where Grosvenor stood by about a foot.  As she fell she rolled  headlong, but instantly recovered herself, standing upon three legs,  with the fourth broken close to the shoulder, while Grosvenor, stepping  back hurriedly in the long grass to avoid her, was tripped up and fell  flat upon his back.  Fearing that, despite her broken leg, the lioness  might spring upon his prostrate friend and badly maul him, Dick  impetuously sprang forward, injecting a new cartridge as he ran, but  stopped short, convulsed with laughter, at the sight of his friend, his  long legs flourishing in the air, rolling with frantic energy out of the  reach of the lioness.  Then, as Grosvenor finally scrambled to his feet,  minus his rifle, which he had dropped during his hurried retreat--while  Jantje had incontinently bolted, carrying Grosvenor's second rifle with  him, as the lioness sprang--Dick again levelled his piece and bowled the  great tawny brute over with a bullet behind the ear, which penetrated  the brain.    Thus satisfactorily terminated the adventurers' first experience with  big game, each of the sportsmen bagging a lion and lioness, while the  cub might be regarded as the joint property of the two.  A very  satisfactory feature of the day's sport was that nobody had received so  much as a scratch, the actual casualties amounting to two Kafir dogs  slain.  As for the Kafirs, they fell upon the carcasses and with  incredible rapidity and skill stripped off the hides and pegged them out  preparatory to treating them in the native fashion, afterwards removing  the heads and carefully depositing each in the near vicinity of an ants'  nest, in order that the insects might remove--as they very speedily  would--every atom of flesh from the bones.  Then, having rendered this  service to the champions who had delivered them from their formidable  enemies, they departed, dancing, to the village, singing a triumphant  song to the glory of the white men, in which each incident of the recent  hunt was graphically described with appropriate gesture.        CHAPTER SEVEN.    THE MAKOLO COUNTRY.    A full week was spent by the travellers among those friendly villagers,  during which Dick Maitland assiduously tended the wounded man, who by  the end of that time, thanks in part to his own healthy flesh and blood,  the result of simple, frugal living, and, more largely, to the young  doctor's skilful treatment, had advanced so far toward recovery that  nature might safely be left to complete the cure.  The week had been not  altogether unprofitably spent in other respects, the two white men  assiduously devoting themselves, with Mafuta's assistance, to the study  of the native language, varied occasionally, on Dick's part, by a little  botanising--during which he discovered some half a dozen plants that  seemed to possess valuable properties--and the taming of the lion cub,  which, after the first two or three days of captivity, responded with  ever-growing alacrity to his young master's advances, until by the end  of six weeks he had learned to answer to the name of Leo, to come at  Dick's call or whistle, and, in short, had become as tame as a dog.  This result, and the gentleness of disposition which Leo manifested,  Dick attributed largely to the fact that the animal was never allowed to  taste blood, or raw flesh of any kind, his food--after a milk diet for  the first three weeks of his captivity--consisting entirely of well-  roasted flesh.    The natives witnessed the preparations for the departure of their white  friends with every manifestation of sincere regret, assisting to drive  up and inspan the oxen, presenting a fine milch cow for Leo's especial  benefit, as well as quantities of mealies, bananas, and other garden  produce, warning the travellers of various difficulties and dangers that  lurked on the next hundred miles or so of their route, and carefully  instructing them how they might best be avoided, and in many other ways  making plain the sorrow with which they bade them farewell.  Finally,  when the oxen were inspanned and the wagon was on the very point of  moving off, Mafuta, who had hitherto been missing, presented himself in  full marching order, armed with shield, assagais, and knobkerrie, with  plumed head-dress, and cows' tails bound about his legs below the knees,  and curtly informed Dick that it was his fixed intention to join the  party!  Although both Dick and Grosvenor did their utmost to dissuade  him, by representing to him the great length and exceeding danger of the  journey upon which they were bound, and the possibility that they might  never return, it was all of no avail, he alternately insisted and  entreated, declaring that he wanted no wages or reward of any kind.  Dick had pulled his brother back out of the grave, and he felt it to be  his duty, as well as his pleasure, to devote himself henceforward to the  service of the white man who had done this wonderful thing; and finally,  when Dick, loath to take the man away from his kith and kin, definitely  refused to take him, the Kafir countered by saying, in effect: \"Very  well; the veldt is free to all, and if you will not permit me to join  your party, I can at least follow you at a distance, and be at hand  whenever you require my services.\"  After which, of course, there was no  more to be said, and Mafuta was allowed to have his own way, to the  great joy of his brethren of the village.    Nor was it very long before the travellers had abundant reason to  congratulate themselves upon their decision in this respect, for Mafuta  not only proved to be a most intelligent and devoted servant, but also a  splendid guide, knowing the exact localities of the various streams and  waterholes on their route, as far as the Zambezi, also the most  favourable crossing places, where the best grass and the most game were  to be found, and, most important of all, perhaps, the exact boundaries  of the fly country.  Indeed but for this last knowledge it is almost  certain that in their anxiety to take the shortest possible cuts they  would probably have lost practically all their cattle, and thus have  been obliged to bring their adventure to a premature end.    On their ninth day out from Mafuta's village they struck the Hanyani  River, without meeting with any adventure worthy of record, and  following its right bank for a couple of days, bore away in an easterly  direction, skirting the northern slope of Mount Inyota, where they  struck another small stream flowing to the northward and eastward; and  as this was, broadly speaking, the direction in which they wished to  travel, and as Mafuta assured them that it discharged into the Zambezi,  they decided to follow it, and did so, finding eventually that it united  its flow with another stream, which they followed, still without any  particular adventure save such as daily occurred while hunting; and  three weeks from the day on which Mafuta joined them the travellers  found themselves gazing with delight upon the broad bosom of the  Zambezi, its waters sparkling in the golden light of the westering sun.    Here again Mafuta's knowledge proved to be of the utmost value, for he  was able to guide the party to a spot where the river was fordable, and  where they succeeded in effecting a crossing that same evening before  sunset.  Once safely arrived on the left bank of the river, Grosvenor  and Dick decided to camp for a few days, in order to give the oxen a  rest, the grass being good.  Also there was a small native village a few  miles higher upstream, where canoes and their crews might be hired, and  within easy paddling distance of which there was a spot where  hippopotami still abounded, affording a prospect of good sport, of which  Grosvenor was particularly anxious to avail himself.  Accordingly, while  the Hottentot Jantje, and 'Nkuku, the Kafir voorlouper, remained in  charge of the wagon and oxen, Ramoo Samee, the groom, accompanied his  masters to the native village, to look after the horses and attend to  the cooking while his employers shot hippopotami and crocodiles from the  two canoes which they chartered; Mafuta, meanwhile, taking four days'  rations, and going off upon a prospecting expedition in search of  elephant and buffalo.
