For the battle everything was adverse on the side of the  Lacedaemonians, while to the enemy everything was rendered favorable by  fortune. It was after dinner that the last council of war was held by  Cleombrotus; and, as the officers had drunk a little at noon, it was  said that the wine in some degree inspired them. And as, when both  sides were fully armed, and it was now evident that a battle would  take place, the people who had provisions for sale, with some of the  baggage-carriers and others who were unwilling to fight, were  proceeding first of all to quit the camp of the Boeotians, the  mercenaries under Hiero the Phocian peltasts, and the Heraclean and  Phliasian cavalry, making a circuit, fell upon them as they were going  off, turned them back, and pursued them to the Boeotian camp; so  that they made the army of the Boeotians larger and more numerous  than before.    Besides, as there was a plain between the armies, the Lacedaemonians  drew up their cavalry before their main body and the Thebans drew up  theirs over against them; but the cavalry of the Thebans had been  exercised in wars with the Orchomenians and Thespians, while that of  the Lacedaemonians was at that time in a very inefficient condition;  for the richest men maintained the horses, and, when notice of an  expedition was given, the men appointed came to ride them, and each  taking his horse, and whatever arms were given him, proceeded at once  to the field; and thus the weakest and least spirited of all the men  were mounted on horseback. Such was the cavalry on either side. Of the  foot, it was said that the Lacedaemonians advanced with each enomoty  drawn up three deep, this arrangement making them not more than twelve  deep in all. The Theban infantry, in close array, were not less than  fifty deep, considering that if they could defeat the body of the  enemy posted around the king, the rest of the army would be an easy  conquest.    As soon as Cleombrotus began to lead forward against the enemy, and  even before the troops about him were aware that he was putting them  in motion, the cavalry had already engaged, and those of the  Lacedaemonians were at once defeated, who, as they fled, fell in among  their own heavy-armed infantry, on which the troops of the Thebans  were also pressing. But that the troops round Cleombrotus had at first  the advantage in the contest, any one may be convinced by certain  proof; for they would not have been able to take him and carry him off  alive unless those who fought in front of him had been at that time  victorious. When, however, Deimon the polemarch, Sphodrias, one of the  attendants at the royal tent, and Cleonymus, his son, were killed, and  the horse-guard, those who are called supporters of the polemarch,  and the rest, being overpowered by the mass of the enemy, were forced  to fall back, the Lacedaemonians on the left, seeing the right wing  thus repulsed, also gave way; yet, tho many were killed, and they were  quite defeated, they were able, when they had repassed the trench  which was in front of the camp, to form themselves under arms in the  place from which they had set out. Their camp was nevertheless not on  level ground, but rather somewhat on an acclivity.    Some of the Lacedaemonians, at the time, who thought their disaster an  insupportable disgrace, exclaimed that they ought to prevent the enemy  from erecting a trophy, and endeavor to recover the dead, not by  making a truce, but by fighting another battle. However, the  polemarchs, seeing that of the Lacedaemonians in all nearly a thousand  had lost their lives; and that of the Spartans, who were in the field  to the number of about seven hundred, about four hundred had fallen;  and observing, also, that all the auxiliaries were too dispirited to  renew the combat, and some of them not even concerned at what had  happened, called a council of the chief officers, and deliberated what  course they ought to pursue; and as all were of opinion that \"they  ought to fetch off the dead by truce,\" they accordingly despatched a  herald to treat respecting a truce. The Thebans soon afterward erected  a trophy, and gave up the dead under truce.    After these occurrences, the messenger who was sent with the news of  the calamity to Lacedaemon arrived there on the last day of the  gymnopaediae and after the chorus of men had made their entry. The  ephors, when they heard of the calamity, were greatly concerned, as, I  think, they naturally must have been; yet they did not order that  chorus to withdraw, but allowed them to finish the entertainment. They  then sent the names of the dead to their several relatives, and gave  notice to the women to make no lamentations, but to bear their  affliction in silence. The day after, a person might have seen those  whose relatives had died appearing in public with looks of  cheerfulness and joy; however, of those whose relatives were said to  be alive, he would have seen but few, and those going about with  gloomy and dejected countenances.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 52: From Book VI of the \"Hellenica.\" At Leuctra, which lies  near Thebes in Boetia, Epaminondas commanding the Boeotians,  overwhelmed the Spartans under Cleombrotus. From this event dates the  decline of Sparta.]          IV    OF THE ARMY OF THE SPARTANS[53]      The regulations which I have mentioned are beneficial alike in peace  and in war; but if any one wishes to learn what the lawgiver contrived  better than other legislators with reference to military proceedings,  he may attend to the following particulars:    In the first place, then, the ephors give the cavalry and infantry  public notice of the years during which they must join the army, as  well as the artizans; for the Lacedaemonians provide themselves in the  field with an abundance of all those things which people use in a  city; and of whatever instruments an army may require in common,  orders are given to bring some on wagons and others on beasts of  burden, as by this arrangement anything left behind is least likely to  escape notice.    For engagements in the field he made the following arrangements: He  ordered that each soldier should have a purple robe and a brazen  shield; for he thought that such a dress had least resemblance to that  of women, and was excellently adapted for the field of battle, as it  is soonest made splendid, and is longest in growing soiled. He  permitted also those above the age of puberty to let their hair grow,  as he thought that they thus appeared taller, more manly, and more  terrible in the eyes of the enemy.    When they were thus equipped, he divided them into six morae of cavalry  and heavy-armed infantry. Each of these morae of the citizens has one  polemarch, four centurions, eight captains of fifty, and sixteen  enomotarchs. The men of these morae are sometimes, according to the  command issued, formed in enomotiae, sometimes by threes, sometimes by  sixes. As to what most people imagine, that the arrangement of the  Lacedaemonians under arms is extremely complex, they conceive the exact  contrary to what is the fact; for in the Lacedaemonian order the  officers are placed in the front ranks, and each rank is in a  condition to perform everything which it is necessary for it to  perform. So easy is it to understand this arrangement that no one who  can distinguish one man from another would fail of learning it; for it  is assigned to some to lead, and enjoined on others to follow.  Shiftings of place, by which the companies are extended or deepened,  are ordered by the word of the enomotarch, as by a herald; and in  these there is nothing in the least difficult to learn.    But how it is possible for men in this arrangement, even if they are  thrown into confusion, to fight with an enemy presenting themselves on  any quarter alike, it is not so easy to understand, except for those  who have been brought up under the institution of Lycurgus. The  Lacedaemonians do with the greatest ease what appears extremely  difficult to other men that are even accustomed to arms. For when they  march in column, one enomotia follows in the rear of another; and if,  when they are in this order, a body of the enemy shows itself in  front, orders are given to each enomotarch to bring up his enomotia to  the front on the left; and this movement is made throughout the whole  army, until it presents itself"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#17)"],[1,"horse, with a Spanish lance in his hand, had  played a hero's dauntless part.    At the commencement of the siege there had been a discussion as to  whether they should occupy the great fortress of Sacsahuaman, or not.  Juan Pizarro had dissuaded the Spanish from the attempt, for, he said:  \"Our forces are too weak to hold both places.  The city is the most  important, and should it happen that we need the fortress we can take  it any time.\"  Without opposition the Indian High Priest had occupied  it with a large body of men.    It was evident, at last, that the Spaniards would {98} either have to  retreat from their town or seize the fortress, which, now that they had  been driven from the walls, commanded their position in the square.  Most of the cavaliers were for retreat.  There is no doubt that the  horse could certainly have cut their way through the ranks of the  besiegers, and have escaped, together with most of the foot as well.    Hernando was quite as persistent as his indomitable brother Francisco,  however, and he talked equally as well to the soldiers.  He made them a  stirring address which he closed by declaring that he had been sent  there to hold the town, and hold it he would if he had to hold it  alone; that he would rather die there in the square with the  consciousness that he had kept his trust than abandon the place.  Juan  and Gonzalo seconded his stirring appeal.  It was resolved that the  fortress should be taken.  Hernando proposed to lead the assault in  person, but Juan interposed with the remark that he had objected to its  seizure in the first instance, and to him rightfully belonged the  leadership of the forlorn hope to repair the error.  Hernando consented.    Juan and Gonzalo, with their commands and fifty of their best horse,  were detailed for the purpose.  By Hernando's instructions they cut  through the Indians and galloped headlong down the road in the  direction of Lima.  The Indians were deceived by the seeming dash of  the horsemen through the lines and, supposing them to be in retreat,  turned their attention to the Spaniards left in the square.  The  conflict which had been intermitted for a space began again with the  utmost fury.    In the midst of it, Juan Pizarro, who had galloped about a league from  the town and then made a long {99} detour, suddenly appeared at  Sacsahuaman.  The Spaniards immediately rushed to the assault.  This  diversion caused the Indians, who had been literally forcing the  Spaniards in the town up against the wall, and in the last ditch, as it  were, to give ground.  Thereupon the dauntless Hernando charged upon  them, drove them out of the square, and succeeded in establishing  communications with Juan and Gonzalo on the hill.  He directed Juan to  hold his position and make no attack, but Juan thought he saw an  opportunity to gain the fortress, and at vespers the Spaniards rushed  at the walls.    There were Indians not only within but without the walls, and the  fighting was soon of the most sanguinary description.  Juan Pizarro had  been wounded previously in a skirmish and on account of this wound was  unable to wear his morion.  Hernando had especially cautioned him to be  careful on this account; but the impetuous valor of the Pizarros was  not to be restrained by considerations of any personal safety, and Juan  was in the front rank of the storming party.  They had cut their way  through to the fort and were battling for entrance when a stone hurled  from the tower struck Juan in the head, knocking him senseless.  The  wound was of such a character that two weeks afterward he died of it in  great agony.  He was the first to pay the penalty.  History has  preserved little concerning him, but some chroniclers have found him  the highest-minded of the brothers--possibly because less is known  about him!  At any rate, he was a valiant soldier.    Gonzalo succeeded to the leadership, and although he and his men fought  heroically, they were at last forced back from the fortress in spite of  the fact that {100} they had gained the outer walls.  The fighting had  transferred itself from the city to the hills, which was a sad tactical  error on the part of the Peruvians, for they had force enough to  overwhelm Hernando and his men in the city, while they held Juan and  Gonzalo in play at Sacsahuaman, in which case all the Spaniards would  eventually have fallen into their hands.    As night fell Hernando left the city and came up to the hill.  The  Spaniards busied themselves in making scaling-ladders, and in the  morning, with the aid of the ladders, the assault was resumed with  desperate fury.  Wall after wall was carried, and finally the fighting  ranged around the citadel.  The Inca had sent five thousand of his best  men to reenforce the defenders, but the Spaniards succeeded in  preventing their entrance to the fort which was now in a sorry plight.  The ammunition--arrows, spears, stone, _et cetera_--of the garrison was  almost spent.  The Spanish attack was pressed as rigorously as at the  beginning.  The High Priest--priests have ever been among the first to  incite people to war, and among the first to abandon the field of  battle--fled with a great majority of his followers, and escaped by  subterranean passages from the citadel, leaving but a few defenders to  do or die.    First among them was a chief, whose name, unfortunately, has not been  preserved.  He was one of those, however, who had drunk of the cup and  pledged himself in the mountains of Yucay.  Driven from wall to wall  and from tower to tower, he and his followers made a heroic defense.  The Spanish chroniclers say that when this hero, whose exploits recall  the half-mythical legends of the early Roman Republic, when men were as  demi-gods, saw one of his men falter, he {101} stabbed him and threw  his body upon the Spaniards.  At last he stood alone upon the last  tower.  The assailants offered him quarter, which he disdained.  Shouting his war-cry of defiance, he dashed his sole remaining weapon  in the faces of the escaladers and then hurled himself bodily upon them  to die on their sword-points.  Let him be remembered as a soldier, a  patriot, and a gentleman.    The fortress was gained!  Dismayed by the fearful loss that they had  sustained, the Peruvians, who had fought so valiantly, if so  unsuccessfully, withdrew temporarily.  Hernando Pizarro was master of  the situation.  He employed the few days of respite given him in  gathering supplies and strengthening his position.  It was well that he  did so, for in a short time the Peruvians once more appeared around the  city, to which they laid a regular siege.    There was more sharp fighting, but nothing like the Homeric combats of  the first investment.  The Peruvians had risen all over the land.  Detached parties of Spaniards had been cut off without mercy.  Francisco Pizarro was besieged in Lima.  Messengers and ships were  despatched in every direction, craving assistance.  Francisco did not  know what had happened in Cuzco, and the brothers in that city began to  despair of their being extricated from their terrible predicament.  Help came to them from an unexpected source.    We left Almagro marching toward Chili.  His was no lovely promenade  through a pleasant, smiling, fertile, wealthy land.  He traversed vast  deserts under burning skies.  He climbed lofty mountains in freezing  cold and found nothing.  In despair, he turned back to Peru.  The  limits assigned to Pizarro were {102} not clear.  Almagro claimed that  the city of Cuzco was within his province, and determined to return and  take it.  On the way his little army, under the command of a very able  soldier named Orgonez, met and defeated a large army of Peruvians.  This, taken with the arrival of the harvest time, which must of  necessity be gathered if the people were not to starve, caused the  subsequent dissipation of the Peruvian army.  The Inca maintained a  fugitive court in the impregnable and secret fastnesses of the  mountains, but the Peruvians never gave any more trouble to the  Spaniards.  They had spent themselves in this one fierce but futile  blow.  I am glad for the sake of their manhood that at least they had  fought one great battle for their lands and liberties.    [Illustration: \"He Threw His Sole Remaining Weapon in the Faces of the  Escaladers\"]      VII. \"The Men of Chili\" and the Civil Wars    Almagro, assisted by treachery on the part of some of the Spaniards who  hated the Pizarros, made himself master of the city, and, breaking his  plighted word, seized Hernando and Gonzalo.    Meanwhile Francisco, the Marquis, had despatched a certain captain  named Alvarado with a force to relieve Cuzco.  Almagro marched out with  his army and defeated the superior force of Alvarado in the battle of  Abancay, in July, 1537, in which, through the generalship of Orgonez,  Alvarado's troops were captured with little or no loss in Almagro's  army.  Almagro had left Gonzalo Pizarro behind in Cuzco, but had taken  Hernando, heavily guarded, with him.  Orgonez had urged Almagro to put  both of them to death.  \"Dead men,\" he pithily remarked, \"need no  guards.\"  On the principle of \"In for a penny, in for a pound,\" {103}  Almagro was already deep enough in the bad graces of Francisco Pizarro,  and he might as well be in deeper than he was, especially as the  execution of Hernando would remove his worst enemy.  But Almagro does  not appear to have been an especially cruel man.  He was an easy-going,  careless, jovial, pleasure-loving soldier, and he spared the lives of  the two brothers.  Gonzalo escaped, and assembling a force, immediately  took the field.    [Illustration: Fernando Cortes.
