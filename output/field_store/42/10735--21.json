Who knows whether the little acrobat was showing his mate what a  splendid fellow he was, how strong of wing and skillful in the tricks of  flight? Be that as it may, the mate of Mis was satisfied in some way or  other, and went with him on a voyage of discovery one afternoon, when  the sky was nicely cloudy and the light pleasantly dull.    Now, like all good parents, Mis and his mate were a bit particular about  what sort of neighborhood they should choose for their home; for the  bringing up of a family, even if it is a small one, is most important.    A peaceful place and a sunny exposure they must have; there must be good  hunting near at hand; and one more thing, too, was necessary. Now, the  house-lot they finally decided upon met all four of these needs, though  it sounds like a joke to tell you where it was. But then, when a clown  goes merrily forth to find him a home, we must not be surprised if he is  funny about it. It was where the sun could shine upon it; though how Mis  and his mate knew that, all on a dull, dark afternoon, I'm sure I can't  tell. Maybe because there wasn't a tree in sight. And as for peace, it  was as undisturbed as a deserted island. It was, in fact, a sort of  island in a sea of air, and at certain times of the day and night there  was game enough in this sea to satisfy even such hunters as they.    Perhaps they chuckled cosily together when they decided to take their  peace and sunshine on the flat roof of a very high building in a very  large city. Their house-lot was covered with pebbles, and it suited them  exactly. So well that they moved in, just as it was.    Yes, those two ridiculous birds set up housekeeping without any house.  Mother Nomer just settled herself on the bare pebbles in a satisfied  way, and that was all there was to it. Not a stick or a wisp of hay or a  feather to mark the place! And as she sat there quietly, a queer thing  happened. She disappeared from sight. As long as she didn't move, she  couldn't be seen. Her dappled feathers didn't look like a bird. They  looked like the light and dark of the pebbles of the flat roof. Ah, so  _that_ was the one thing more that was necessary for her home, besides  sunshine and peace and good hunting. It must be where she could sit and  not show; where she could hide by just looking like what was near her,  like a sand-colored grasshopper on the sand in the sun,[2] or a  walking-stick on a twig,[2] or a butterfly on the bark of a tree.[2]    Yes, Mis's mate knew, in some natural wise way of her own, the secret of  making use of what we call her \"protective coloration.\" This is one of  the very most important secrets Mother Nature has given her children,  and many use it--not birds alone, but beasts and insects also. They use  it in their own wild way and think nothing about it. We say that it is  their instinct that leads them to choose places where they cannot easily  be seen. If you do not understand exactly what instinct is, do not feel  worried, for there are some things about that secret of Mother Nature  that even the wisest men in the world have not explained. But this we do  know, that when her instincts led Mother Nomer to choose the pebbly roof  as a background for her mottled feathers, she did just naturally very  much the same thing that the soldiers in the world-war did when they  made use of great guns painted to look like things they were not, and  ships painted to look like the waves beneath them and the clouds in the  sky above. Only, the soldiers did not use their protective coloration  naturally and by instinct. They did this by taking thought; and very  proud they felt, too, of being able to do this by hard study. They  talked about it a great deal and the French taught the world a new word,  _camouflage_, to call it by. And their war-time camouflage _was_  wonderful, even though it was only a clumsy imitation of what Mother  Nature did when the feathers of Mother Nomer were made to grow dappled  like little blotches of light and dark; or, to put it the other way  about, when the bird was led, by her instinct, to choose for the  nesting-time a place where she did not show.    Of course, it was not just the gravel on the flat roof that would match  her feathers; for there isn't a house in the land that is nearly so old  as one thousand years, and birds of this sort have been building much  longer than that. No, so far as color went, Mother Nomer might have  chosen a spot in an open field, where there were little broken sticks or  stones to give it a mottled look--such a place, indeed, as her ancestors  used to find for their nesting in the old days when there were no  houses. Such a place, too, as most of this kind of bird still seek; for  not all of them, by any means, are roof-dwellers in cities.    Our bird with the dappled feathers, however, sat in one little spot on  that large roof for about sixteen days and nights, with time enough off  now and then to get food and water, and to exercise her wings. When she  was away, Mis came and sat on the same spot. If you had been there to  see them come and go, you would have wondered why they cared about that  particular spot. It looked like the rest of the sunny roof--just little  humps of light and dark. Ah, yes! but two of those little humps of light  and dark were not pebbles: they were eggs; and if you couldn't have  found them, Mis and his mate could, though I think even they had to  remember where they were instead of eye-spying them.    By the time sixteen days were over, there were no longer eggs beneath  the fluffy feathers that had covered them. Instead, there were two  little balls of down, though you couldn't have seen them either, unless  you had been about near enough to touch them; for the downy children of  Mis were as dappled as his mate and her eggs, and they had, from the  moment of their hatching, the instinct for keeping still if danger came  near.    [Illustration: _Peaceful enough, indeed, had been the brooding days._]    Peaceful enough, indeed, had been the brooding days of Mother Nomer.  Something of the noise and bustle, to be sure, of the city streets came  up to her; but that was from far below, and things far off are not worth  worrying about. Sometimes, too, the sound of voices floated out from  the upper windows of the building, quite near; but the birds soon became  used to that.    When the twins were but a few days old, however, their mother had a real  scare. A man came up to take down some electric wires that had been  fastened not far from the spot that was the Nomer home. He tramped  heavily about, throwing down his tools here and there, and whistling  loudly as he worked. All this frightened little Mother Nomer. There is  no doubt about that, for her heart beat more and more quickly. But she  didn't budge. She couldn't. It was a part of her camouflage trick to sit  still in danger. The greater the danger, the stiller to sit! She even  kept her eyes nearly shut, until, when the man had cut the last and  nearest end of wire and put all his things together in a pile ready to  take down, he came to look over the edge of the roof-wall. As he bent to  do this, he brushed suddenly against her.    Then Mother Nomer sprang into the air; and the man jumped, in such  surprise that, had it not been for the wall, he would have fallen from  the roof. It would be hard to tell which was the more startled for a  moment--man or bird. But Mother Nomer did not fly far. She fell back to  the roof some distance from her precious babies and fluttered pitifully  about, her wings and tail spread wide and dragging as she moved lamely.  She did not look like a part of the pebbly roof now. She showed  plainly, for she was moving. She looked like a wounded bird, and the  man, thinking he must have hurt her in some way, followed her to pick  her up and see what the trouble was. Three times he almost got her.  Almost, but not quite. Crippled as she seemed, she could still fumble  and flutter just out of reach; and when at last the man had followed her  to a corner of the roof far from her young, Mother Nomer sprang up, and  spreading her long, pointed wings, took flight, whole and sound as a  bird need be.    The man understood and laughed. He laughed at himself for being fooled.  For it wasn't the first time a bird had tricked him so. Once, when he  was a country boy, a partridge, fluttering as if broken-winged, had led  him through the underbrush of the wood-lot; and once a bird by the  river-side stumbled on before him, crying piteously, \"Pete! Pete!  Pete-weet!\" and once--Why, yes, he should have remembered that this is  the trick of many a mother-bird when danger threatens her young.    So he went back, with careful step, to where he had been before. He  looked this way and that. There was no nest. He saw no young. The little  Nomer twins were not the son and daughter of Mis, the clown, and Mother  Nomer, the trick cripple, for nothing! They sat there, the little  rascals, right before his eyes, and budged not; they could practice the  art of camouflage, too.    [Illustration: _The little rascals could practise the art of  camouflage._]    But as he stood and looked, a wistful light came into the eyes of the  man. It had been many years since he had found nesting birds and watched  the ways of them. His memory brought old pictures back to him. The  crotch in the tree, where the robin had plastered her nest, modeling the  mud with her feathered breast; the brook-edge willows, where the  blackbirds built; the meadow, with its hidden homes of bobolinks; and  the woods where the whip-poor-wills called o' nights. His thoughts made  a boy of him again, and he forgot everything else in the world in his  wish to see the little birds he felt sure must be among the pebbles  before him. So he crept about carefully, here and there, and at last  came upon the children of Mis.

Some time after his death some one said of  him in the presence of the duc d'Ayen, that he had been an unfortunate  man, for he had been all his life the butt of public hatred and  universal contempt. \"Rather say,\" replied the duke, \"that he has been a  fortunate man; for if justice had been rendered to him according to his  deserts, he would have been hanged at least a dozen times.\"    The duc d'Ayen was right: M. de la Vrilliere was a brazen-faced rogue;  a complete thief, without dignity, character, or heart. His cupidity  was boundless: the _lettres de cachet_ emanated from his office, and he  carried on an execrable trade in them. If any person wished to get rid  of a father, brother, or husband, they only had to apply to M. de la  Vrilliere. He sold the king's signature to all who paid ready money for  it. This man inspired me with an invincible horror and repugnance. For  his part, as I was not disgusting, he contented himself with hating me;  he was animated against me by his old and avaricious mistress, madame  de Langeac, alias Subutin. Langeac could not endure me. She felt that  it was better to be the mistress of Louis XV than that of the _petit la  Vrilliere _, for so her lover was called at court. I knew that she was  no friend of mine, and that her lover sided with the Choiseuls against  me; and was consequently the more delighted to see the little scoundrel  come to receive the order for avenging me. He entered with an air of  embarrassment; and whilst he made me a salute as low as to the king,  this latter, in a brief severe tone, ordered him to send the sieur  Ledoux to Saint Lazare forthwith. He departed without reply, and half an  hour afterwards returned, to say that it was done. The king then said to  him,    \"Do you know this lady?\"    \"No, sire.\"    \"Well, I desire you henceforward to have the greatest consideration for  her as my best friend, and whoever wishes to prove his zeal for me, will  honor and cherish her.\"    The king then invited him to sup with us, and I am sure that during the  whole repast I was the hardest morsel he had to digest.    Some days afterwards I made acquaintance with a person much more  important than the little duke, and destined to play a great part in the  history of France. I mean M. de Maupeou, the late chancellor, who, in  his disgrace, would not resign his charge. M. de Maupeou possessed one  of those firm and superior minds, which, in spite of all obstacles,  change the face of empires. Ardent, yet cool; bold, but reflective; the  clamors of the populace did not astonish, nor did any obstacles arrest  him. He went on in the direct path which his will chalked out. Quitting  the magistracy, he became its most implacable enemy, and after a deadly  combat he came off conqueror. He felt that the moment had arrived for  freeing royalty from the chains which it had imposed on itself. It was  necessary, he has said to me a hundred times, for the kings of France  in past ages to have a popular power on which they could rely for the  overturning of the feudal power. This power they found in the high  magistracy; but since the reign of Louis XIII the mission of the  parliaments had finished, the nobility was reduced, and they became no  less formidable than the enemy whom they had aided in subduing.    \"Before fifty years,\" pursued M. de Maupeou, \"kings will be nothing in  France, and parliaments will be everything.\"    Talented, a good speaker, even eloquent, M. de Maupeou possessed  qualities which made the greatest enterprises successful. He was  convinced that all men have their price, and that it is only to find  out the sum at which they are purchasable.* As brave personally as a  marechal of France, his enemies (and he had many) called him a coarse  and quarrelsome man. Hated by all, he despised men in a body, and jeered  at them individually; but little sensible to the charms of our sex, he  only thought of us by freaks, and as a means of relaxation. This is M.  de Maupeou, painted to the life. As for his person, you know it as well  as I do. I have no need to tell you, that he was little, ugly, and his  complexion was yellow, bordering upon green. It must be owned, however,  that his face, full of thought and intelligence, fully compensated for  all the rest.         *This gentleman would have been an able coadjutor for Sir       Robert Walpole.--Trans.    You know how, as first president of the parliament of Paris, he  succeeded his father as vice-chancellor. At the resignation of the  titular M. de Lamoignon*, the elder Maupeou received his letters of  nomination, and as soon as they were registered, he resigned in favor of  his son. The Choiseuls had allowed the latter to be nominated, relying  on finding him a creature. I soon saw that the Choiseuls were mistaken.         *In September, 1768.  (au.)    It was in the month of October, that Henriette, always my favorite, came  to me with an air of unusual mystery, to say, that a black* and ugly  gentleman wished to see me; that on the usual reply that I was not  visible, he had insisted, and sent, at the same time, a cautiously  sealed note. I took it, opened, and read these words:--        *i.e., black-haired and/or dressed in black (Gutenberg ed.)    \"The chancellor of France wishes to have the honor of presenting his  respectful homage to madame la comtesse du Barry.\"    \"Let him come in,\" I said to Henriette.    \"I will lay a wager, madame, that he comes to ask some favor.\"    \"I believe,\" replied I, \"that he is more frequently the solicited than  the solicitor.\"    Henriette went out, and in a few minutes led in, thro' the private  corridors which communicated with my apartment, his highness monseigneur  Rene Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou, chevalier and chancellor of  France. As soon as he entered I conceived a good opinion of him, altho'  I had only seen him walk. His step was firm and assured, like that of a  man confident in the resources of his own talents.    \"Madame la comtesse du Barry,\" he said, \"would have a right to complain  of me, if I did not come and lay my person at her feet. I had the more  impatience to express to her my devotion, as I feared she had been  prejudiced against me.\"    \"How, monseigneur?\"    \"The gate by which I entered the ministry--\"    \"Is not agreeable to me, as being that of my enemies, but I feel assured  that you will not side with them against me.\"    \"Certainly not, madame; it is my wish to give you pleasure in every  thing, and I flatter myself I may merit your friendship.\"    After many other compliments, the Chancellor asked me, with much  familiarity, when my presentation was to take place, and why it had  not yet occurred. I replied, that the delay arose from the intrigues  of Choiseul, and the king shrunk from the discontent of a handful of  courtiers.    \"I am sorry for it,\" said M. de Maupeou; \"in the first place, madame,  because of the interest I take in you, and also because for his majesty,  it would be a means of striking terror into the opposing party. You  know, madame, how annoying parliaments are to all your friends, and  with what bitterness those of Bretagne and Paris, at this moment, are  pursuing the duc d'Aiguillon.\"    \"Do you think,\" I replied with emotion, \"that matters are unfavorable  towards him?\"    \"I hope not, but he must be warmly supported.\"    \"Ah! I will aid him with all my influence. He is no doubt innocent of  the crimes imputed to him.\"    \"Yes, certainly. He has done no other wrong than to defend the authority  of the crown against the enmity of the parliaments.\"    We continued some time to talk of parliaments and parliament men: then  we agreed that M. de Maupeou should see me again, accompanied by the duc  d'Aiguillon, who should have the credit of presenting him, and he left  me with as much mystery as he had entered.    When the king came to see me, I said to him, \"I have made acquaintance  with your chancellor: he is a very amiable man, and I hope that he will  not conduct himself improperly towards me.\"    \"Where did you see him?\"    \"Here, sire, and but a short time since.\"    \"He came then to visit you?\"    \"Yes, in person, that he might obtain the favor of being permitted to  pay his court to me.\"    \"Really what you tell me seems perfectly unaccountable. He has then  burst from the hands of the Choiseuls? It is amusing. Poor Choiseul,  when soliciting for Maupeou, he most tremendously deceived himself.\"    \"At least, sire, you must own that he has given you no fool.\"    \"True. The chancellor is a man full of talents, and I do not doubt but  that he will restore to my crown that power which circumstances have  deprived it of. However, if you see him familiarly, advise him not to  persuade me to extreme measures. I wish all should work for the best,  without violent courses and without painful struggles.\"    These last words proved to me the natural timidity of the king.    \"I knew very well,\" added the king, \"that Maupeou would not prove a man  for the Choiseuls. The main point is, that he should be mine, and I am  content.\"    Louis XV was then satisfied with the chancellor, but he was not equally  so with the comte Jean.    \"I do not like,\" said he to me, \"your Du Barry monkey. He is a  treacherous fellow, who has betrayed his party, and I hope some of these  mornings we shall hear that the devil has wrung his neck.\"        CHAPTER IX           The king of Denmark--The courtesans of Paris--The duc de       Choiseul and the bishop of Orleans--Witty repartees of the       king of Denmark--His visit to madame du Barry--\"The court of       king Petaud,\" a satire--Letter of the duc d'Aiguillon to       Voltaire--The duchesse de Grammont mystified--Unpublished       letter of Voltaire's    From this moment, and in spite of all that comte Jean could say  against it, a new counsellor was admitted to my confidence.
