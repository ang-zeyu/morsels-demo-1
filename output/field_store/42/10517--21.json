Still it was hoped,  against hope, that some adjustment might be made to avert the calamities  of a practical application of the theory of an \"irrepressible conflict.\"  Few, if any, then doubted the right of a State to withdraw its grants  delegated to the Federal Government, or, in other words, to secede from  the Union; but in the South this was generally regarded as the remedy of  last resort, to be applied only when ruin or dishonor was the  alternative. No rash or revolutionary action was taken by the Southern  States, but the measures adopted were considerate, and executed  advisedly and deliberately. The Presidential election occurred (as far  as the popular vote, which determined the result, was concerned) in  November, 1860. Most of the State Legislatures convened soon afterward  in regular session. In some cases special sessions were convoked for the  purpose of calling State Conventions--the recognized representatives of  the sovereign will of the people--to be elected expressly for the  purpose of taking such action as should be considered needful and proper  under the existing circumstances.    These conventions, as it was always held and understood, possessed all  the power of the people assembled in mass; and therefore it was conceded  that they, and they only, could take action for the withdrawal of a  State from the Union. The consent of the respective States to the  formation of the Union had been given through such conventions, and it  was only by the same authority that it could properly be revoked. The  time required for this deliberate and formal process precludes the idea  of hasty or passionate action, and none who admit the primary power of  the people to govern themselves can consistently deny its validity and  binding obligation upon every citizen of the several States. Not only  was there ample time for calm consideration among the people of the  South, but for due reflection by the General Government and the people  of the Northern States.    President Buchanan was in the last year of his administration. His  freedom from sectional asperity, his long life in the public service,  and his peace-loving and conciliatory character, were all guarantees  against his precipitating a conflict between the Federal Government and  any of the States; but the feeble power that he possessed in the closing  months of his term to mold the policy of the future was painfully  evident. Like all who had intelligently and impartially studied the  history of the formation of the Constitution, he held that the Federal  Government had no rightful power to coerce a State. Like the sages and  patriots who had preceded him in the high office that he filled, he  believed that \"our Union rests upon public opinion, and can never by  cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it can not  live in the affections of the people, it must one day perish. Congress  may possess many means of preserving it by conciliation, but the sword  was not placed in their hand to preserve it by force.\"--(Message of  December 3, 1860.)    Ten years before, Mr. Calhoun addressing the Senate with all the  earnestness of his nature and with that sincere desire to avert the  danger of disunion which those who knew him best never doubted, had  asked the emphatic question, \"How can the Union be saved?\" He answered  his question thus:        \"There is but one way by which it can be [saved] with any      certainty; and that is by a full and final settlement, on the      principles of justice, of all the questions at issue between the      sections. The South asks for justice--simple justice--and less      she ought not to take. She has no compromise to offer but the      Constitution, and no concession or surrender to make....        \"Can this be done? Yes, easily! Not by the weaker party; for it      can of itself do nothing--not even protect itself--but by the      stronger.... But will the North agree to do this? It is for her      to answer this question. But, I will say, she can not refuse if      she has half the love of the Union which she professes to have,      nor without exposing herself to the charge that her love of      power and aggrandizement is far greater than her love of the      Union.\"    During the ten years that intervened between the date of this speech and  the message of Mr. Buchanan cited above, the progress of sectional  discord and the tendency of the stronger section to unconstitutional  aggression had been fearfully rapid. With very rare exceptions, there  were none in 1850 who claimed the right of the Federal Government to  apply coercion to a State. In 1860 men had grown to be familiar with  threats of driving the South into submission to any act that the  Government, in the hands of a Northern majority, might see fit to  perform. During the canvass of that year, demonstrations had been made  by _quasi_-military organizations in various parts of the North, which  looked unmistakably to purposes widely different from those enunciated  in the preamble to the Constitution, and to the employment of means not  authorized by the powers which the States had delegated to the Federal  Government.    Well-informed men still remembered that, in the Convention which framed  the Constitution, a proposition was made to authorize the employment of  force against a delinquent State, on which Mr. Madison remarked that  \"the use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of  war than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered  by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which  it might have been bound.\" The Convention expressly refused to confer  the power proposed, and the clause was lost. While, therefore, in 1860,  many violent men, appealing to passion and the lust of power, were  inciting the multitude, and preparing Northern opinion to support a war  waged against the Southern States in the event of their secession, there  were others who took a different view of the case. Notable among such  was the \"New York Tribune,\" which had been the organ of the  abolitionists, and which now declared that, \"if the cotton States wished  to withdraw from the Union, they should be allowed to do so\"; that \"any  attempt to compel them to remain, by force, would be contrary to the  principles of the Declaration of Independence and to the fundamental  ideas upon which human liberty is based\"; and that, \"if the Declaration  of Independence justified the secession from the British Empire of three  millions of subjects in 1776, it was not seen why it would not justify  the secession of five millions of Southerners from the Union in 1861.\"  Again, it was said by the same journal that, \"sooner than compromise  with the South and abandon the Chicago platform,\" they would \"let the  Union slide.\" Taunting expressions were freely used--as, for example,  \"If the Southern people wish to leave the Union, we will do our best to  forward their views.\"    All this, it must be admitted, was quite consistent with the  oft-repeated declaration that the Constitution was a \"covenant with  hell,\" which stood as the caption of a leading abolitionist paper of  Boston. That signs of coming danger so visible, evidences of hostility  so unmistakable, disregard of constitutional obligations so wanton,  taunts and jeers so bitter and insulting, should serve to increase  excitement in the South, was a consequence flowing as much from reason  and patriotism as from sentiment. He must have been ignorant of human  nature who did not expect such a tree to bear fruits of discord and  division.

In November, 1860, after the result of the Presidential election was  known, the Governor of Mississippi, having issued his proclamation  convoking a special session of the Legislature to consider the propriety  of calling a convention, invited the Senators and Representatives of the  State in Congress, to meet him for consultation as to the character of  the message he should send to the Legislature when assembled.    While holding, in common with my political associates, that the right of  a State to secede was unquestionable, I differed from most of them as to  the probability of our being permitted peaceably to exercise the right.  The knowledge acquired by the administration of the War Department for  four years, and by the chairmanship of the Military Committee of the  Senate at two different periods, still longer in combined duration, had  shown me the entire lack of preparation for war in the South. The  foundries and armories were in the Northern States, and there were  stored all the new and improved weapons of war. In the arsenals of the  Southern States were to be found only arms of the old and rejected  models.

Not infrequently, however, the rush of the  bull and the blow dealt to the horse is of such force as to overthrow both  animal and rider, but the latter is usually rescued from danger by the  _chulos_ and _banderilleros_, who, by means of their red cloaks (_capas_),  divert the bull from the fallen _picador_, who either escapes from the ring  or mounts a fresh horse. The number of horses killed in this manner is one  of the chief features of the fight, a bull's prowess being reckoned  accordingly. About 6000 horses are killed every year in Spain. At the sound  of a trumpet the _picadores_ retire from the ring, the dead horses are  dragged out, and the second division of the fight, the _suerte de  banderillear_, or planting the darts, begins. The _banderillas_ are barbed  darts about 18 in. long, ornamented with coloured paper, one being held in  each hand of the bull-fighter, who, standing 20 or 30 yds. from the bull,  draws its attention to him by means of violent gestures. As the bull  charges, the _banderillero_ steps towards him, dexterously plants both  darts in the beast's neck, and draws aside in the nick of time to avoid its  horns. Four pairs of _banderillas_ are planted in this way, rendering the  bull mad with rage and pain. Should the animal prove of a cowardly nature  and refuse to attack repeatedly, _banderillas de fuego_ (fire) are used.  These are furnished with fulminating crackers, which explode with terrific  noise as the bull careers about the ring. During this division numerous  manoeuvres are sometimes indulged in for the purpose of tiring the bull  out, such as leaping between his horns, vaulting over his back with the  _garrocha_ as he charges, and inviting his rushes by means of elaborate  flauntings of the cloak (_floreos_, flourishes).    Another trumpet-call gives the signal for the final division of the fight,  the _suerte de matar_ (killing). This is carried out by the _espada_,  alone, his assistants being present only in the case of emergency or to get  the bull back to the proper part of the ring, should he bolt to a distance.  The _espada_, taking his stand before the box of the president, holds aloft  in his left hand sword and _muleta_ and in his right his hat, and in set  phrases formally dedicates (_brinde_) the death of the bull to the  president or some other personage of rank, finishing by tossing his hat  behind his back and proceeding bareheaded to the work of killing the bull.  This is a process accompanied by much formality. The _espada_, armed with  the _estoque_, a sword with a heavy flat blade, brings the bull into the  proper position by means of passes with the _muleta_, a small red silk flag  mounted on a short staff, and then essays to kill him with a single thrust,  delivered through the back of the neck close to the head and downward into  the heart. This stroke is a most difficult one, requiring long practice as  well as great natural dexterity, and very frequently fails of its object,  the killing of the bull often requiring repeated thrusts. The stroke  (_estocada_) is usually given _a volapie_ (half running), the _espada_  delivering the thrust while stepping forward, the bull usually standing  still. Another method is _recibiendo_ (receiving), the _espada_ receiving  the onset of the bull upon the point of his sword. Should the bull need a  _coup de grace_, it is given by a _chulo_, called _puntillero_, with a  dagger which pierces the spinal marrow. The dead beast is then dragged out  of the ring by the triple mule-team, while the _espada_ makes a tour of  honour, being acclaimed, in the case of a favourite, with the most  extravagant enthusiasm. The ring is then raked over, a second bull is  introduced, and the spectacle begins anew. Upon great occasions, such as a  coronation, a _corrida_ in the ancient style is given by amateurs, who are  clad in gala costumes without armour of any kind, and mounted upon steeds  of good breed and condition. They are armed with sharp lances, with which  they essay to kill the bull while protecting themselves and their steeds  from his horns. As the bulls in these encounters have not been weakened by  many wounds and tired out by much running, the performances of the  gentlemen fighters are remarkable for pluck and dexterity.

BULLFINCH (_Pyrrhula vulgaris_), the ancient English name  given to a bird  belonging to the family _Fringillidae_ (see FINCH), of a bluish-grey and  black colour above, and generally of a bright tile-red beneath, the female  differing chiefly in having its under-parts chocolate-brown. It is a shy  bird, not associating with other species, and frequents well-wooded  districts, being very rarely seen on moors or other waste lands. It builds  a shallow nest composed of twigs lined with fibrous roots, on low trees or  thick underwood, only a few feet from the ground, and lays four or five  eggs of a bluish-white colour speckled and streaked with purple. The young  remain with their parents during autumn and winter, and pair in spring, not  building their nests, however, till May. In spring and summer they feed on  the buds of trees and bushes, choosing, it is said, such only as contain  the incipient blossom, and thus doing immense injury to orchards and  gardens. In autumn and winter they feed principally on wild fruits and on  seeds. The note of the bullfinch, in the wild state, is soft and pleasant,  but so low as scarcely to be audible; it possesses, however, great powers  of imitation, and considerable memory, and can thus be taught to whistle a  variety of tunes. Bullfinches are very abundant in the forests of Germany,  and it is there that most of the piping bullfinches are trained. They are  taught continuously for nine months, and the lesson is repeated throughout  the first moulting, as during that change the young birds are apt to forget  all that they have previously acquired. The bullfinch is a native of the  northern countries of Europe, occurring in Italy and other southern parts  only as a winter visitor. White and black varieties are occasionally met  with; the latter are often produced by feeding the bullfinch exclusively on  hempseed, when its plumage gradually changes to black. It rarely breeds in  confinement, and hybrids between it and the canary have been produced on  but few occasions.    BULLI, a town of Camden county, New South Wales, Australia, 59 m. by rail  S. of Sydney. Pop. (1901) 2500. It is the headquarters of the Bulli Mining  Company, whose coal-mine on the flank of the Illawarra Mountains is worked  by a tunnel, 2 m. long, driven into the heart of the mountain. From this  tunnel the coal is conveyed by rail for 11/2 m. to a pier, whence it is  shipped to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane by a fleet of steam colliers. The  beautiful Bulli Pass, 1000 ft. above the sea, over the Illawarra range, is  one of the most attractive tourist resorts in Australia.    BULLINGER, HEINRICH (1504-1575), Swiss reformer, son of Dean Heinrich  Bullinger by his wife Anna (Wiederkehr), was born at Bremgarten, Aargau, on  the 18th of July 1504. He studied at Emmerich and Cologne, where the  teaching of Peter Lombard led him, through Augustine and Chrysostom, to  first-hand  study of the Bible. Next the writings of Luther and Melanchthon  appealed to him. Appointed teacher (1522) in the cloister school of Cappel,  he lectured on Melanchthon's _Loci Communes_ (1521). He heard Zwingli at  Zuerich in 1527, and next year accompanied him to the disputation at Berne.  He was made pastor of Bremgarten in 1529, and married Anna Adlischweiler, a  nun, by whom he had eleven children. After the battle [v.04 p.0791] of  Cappel (11th of October 1531), in which Zwingli fell, he left Bremgarten.  On the 9th of December 1531 he was chosen to succeed Zwingli as chief  pastor of Zuerich. A strong writer and thinker, his spirit was essentially  unifying and sympathetic, in an age when these qualities won little  sympathy. His controversies on the Lord's Supper with Luther, and his  correspondence with Lelio Sozini (see SOCINUS), exhibit, in different  connexions, his admirable mixture of dignity and tenderness. With Calvin he  concluded (1549) the _Consensus Tigurinus_ on the Lord's Supper. The  (second) Helvetic Confession (1566) adopted in Switzerland, Hungary,  Bohemia and elsewhere, was his work. The volumes of the _Zurich Letters_,  published by the Parker Society, testify to his influence on the English  reformation in later stages. Many of his sermons were translated into  English (reprinted, 4 vols., 1849). His works, mainly expository and  polemical, have not been collected. He died at Zuerich on the 17th of  September 1575.    See Carl Pestalozzi, _Leben_ (1858); Raget Christoffel, _H. Bullinger_  (1875); Justus Heer, in Hauck's _Realencyklopadie_ (1897).    (A.

The word appears in an English act of 1336 in the  French form \"puissent sauvement porter a les exchanges ou bullion ...  argent en plate, vessel d'argent, &c.\"; and apparently it is connected with  _bouillon_, the sense of \"boiling\" being transferred in English to the  melting of metal, so that _bullion_ in the passage quoted meant  \"melting-house\" or \"mint.\" The first recorded instance of the use of the  word for precious metal as such in the mass is in an act of 1451. From the  use of gold and silver as a medium of exchange, it followed that they  should approximate in all nations to a common degree of fineness; and  though this is not uniform even in coins, yet the proportion of alloy in  silver, and of carats alloy to carats fine in gold, has been reduced to  infinitesimal differences in"]]]
