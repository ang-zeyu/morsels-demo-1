She told me that one great grief of hers was that she had no good  likeness of her children as they were at that dreadful time. I  was embarrassed and silent. 'What can I do to help you?' I was  thinking over and over again, 'Shall I show the picture? Yes,  right or wrong, I must.'    I didn't know how to begin to tell her about it. I prayed for  words. Then I began in curt crisp sentences to tell her. 'You may  not like it. You must not be disappointed,' I said. 'Why?' she  asked. But I did not try to explain. I would let the picture  plead its own point of view. When we were back I asked Dick for  it, and I knocked at her room door and gave if to her.    Then I went out and watched a team ploughing, till Dick called me  in.    At lunch the guests were very quiet and subdued, but seemed quite  cheerful. Afterwards, before I started for home, she came and  talked to me alone.    'Is this the scene of the picture?' she asked me, as she led me  across the yard. 'This grass plot between these rocks and those  trees?'    'Yes, it's just here apparently,' I said. 'You see that great  tree there. One can hardly mistake it.'    'I remember the spot long ago,' she said. 'I came down to my  sister's to leave the children with her for a country holiday  just before that time. We were staying at that place we went to  this morning; they called it Happy Valley, and we drove over to  this place where there was a store. It was only a month or two  before the time May Day, I think. I remember my children playing  hide-and-seek here with the piccaninnies; yes, playing other  games too.' Her lips quivered, but she went on quite steadily.    'Those piccaninnies in that picture do you know any of their  faces?'    'Yes,' I said, 'I knew two that were burnt, and did not get  better; two I used to come and see. And Dick says he recognizes  two or three little chaps that have died since he came here to  live after the \"Rebellion\" was over.'    'And how do you explain it?' she asked gently, 'this vision of  dead children so charmingly colored, so color-blind from a South  African point of view?'    I thought before I spoke.    'It is, I believe, a real Vision,' I said. 'The one who painted  it, whoever he was, saw more than we most of us see. Possibly he  was the seventh son of a seventh son. Very apparently he had a  pure heart. The picture was painted on Innocents' Day. I have  verified the date. You see he has called it \"Innocents.\" It was  painted in the children's old playing-place. He saw them in their  new life with the beauty of things South African like a good  dream about them, and the stupidity of things South African  passed from them like a bad one.'    She did not speak for quite a long time. I feared I had hurt her  somehow. But at last she spoke and reassured me.    'Yes, I think you understand how the picture came to be and what  it means. I used to be dreadfully bitter about the Mashonas. I  try not to be now. Couldn't you build on my account a little  school or a little church in that forlorn place? There are some  villages near by, aren't there? Couldn't you call it for me the  Mission of the Innocents? I'd like to ask my host if he'll give  you the picture for the church should you build it for me. In my  house I should be shy about hanging it. I am afraid people might  scoff at it behind my back in their South African way, and I  couldn't bear that easily. I know in my heart of hearts it's true  that Picture as true as it's beautiful. They're all happy now,  likely enough happy together. They were not likely to have been  happy in the same ways had they grown up in South Africa.'        JULIAN    I. THE SOP        Julian Borne was going to leave the Mission that had been his  home for three years. He was a spruce-looking person with quite  pleasantly colored red hair and a turned-up moustache. A Bishop  had commended him, and a Canon Superintendent had delighted to  honor him. His immediate superior, a weather-beaten Missionary,  had, however, partially dissented from the chorus of approval. He  had discriminated. He credited Julian with fine gifts of  organization, but he submitted that he had proved himself lacking  in qualities of heart far too often. His discrimination had been  received coldly by the Canon Superintendent, and liberally  discounted on the scores of dullness, crankiness, want of vision,  yes jealousy. Now at last something had happened to disturb the  Canon Superintendent in his optimism, in his forecast of Julian's  brilliant usefulness to the Mission.    Julian had suddenly decided to leave his work. He had the offer  of a congenial berth and a rising salary in the Cathedral city.  He put the thing very kindly to the Canon Superintendent. He  would help the Mission of course, wouldn't he just, when he  should climb into the seats of the mighty? He would be a  volunteer henceforward the Cause could count upon him with a  sound commercial position for his jumping-off ground. Yet the  fact remained that he was leaving his work, having loved this  present world.    It was the day of farewell to the surroundings of the last three  years. Julian was to ride into town that afternoon.    He went to lunch with Dick Hunter, the weather-beaten one, and  talked to him as he imagined he wanted to be talked to. He had  always liked his host's Bohemian ways very well, he was only  impatient of his preoccupation with native postulants. There was  his usual fly-swarm of them, that day as other days, about his  threshold, and lunch was late, as usual. At last they began.  Julian had the first two courses to himself for the most part,  while his host was busy once again outside. Then came a third  course. 'I had this for you,' said the host rather pathetically,  as he settled down to his bread and cheese. 'It seemed the right  thing for the farewell banquet of a Mission. It's the food of the  country.'    Sure enough under the cover was a platter of brown millet with a  savory side dish of beans for relish. Julian flushed up. 'No  thanks, I've never tried millet pap yet, and I don't mean to,' he  said.    His host smiled, 'As you will,' said he. 'You won't mind my  having some, will you?' He helped himself sparingly, then he  called the Mashona boy to take the dishes away. Julian the  callous felt a shade remorseful.    'Here, let me try what it's like,' he said. His host took a piece  of the millet-food on a fork, and dipped it in the side dish. He  gave the result to Julian on a plate. 'For old sake's sake,' he  murmured. Julian nibbled away rather delicately. 'It's not so  awful,' he said.    He was riding into Rosebery that afternoon when the incident  recurred to him.    He had a great grip of his subjects whatever they were so long as  they were payable propositions, to use his own phrase.    The textual study of the Bible had been accounted such a  proposition until recently. Bible-words they were now that buzzed  in his ears.    'He it is to whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it. And  when He had dipped the sop. . .'    The sop, the dipping, yes, he remembered now. He had read the  words in Church two or three evenings ago.    'He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.' He started.  'And after the sop, Satan entered.' He shuddered.    He wished that incident at lunch-time had never occurred. Of  course it was pure chance, but still it was bizarre.    Was it pure chance? 'I'm not so sure,' reflected Julian. 'I wish  Hunter'd mind his own business.'    That farewell banquet at the Mount Pleasant Mission had left an  ill taste behind.        II. THE SYMBOL OF THE SPURNED        Some five years after, Julian Borne came up to Rosebery by the  early train. He awoke at dawn and threw up the window. He was  traveling in a sleeping compartment deluxe. He had appearances to  keep up now.    The sun had tilted up a golden arc and the withered landscape  took a lavish glory.    Julian's eyes fell on some shabby thatched roofs that the blaze  was brightening. 'Mount Pleasant Mission!' he said to himself.  'and to think I wasted three good years of my life there. Three  bob a day with rations and no drinks. Good Lord!' He filled his  pipe as the poverty-stricken homestead passed out of sight. 'Yet  it wasn't all waste,' he went on. 'I got to know the country and  its questions. I got to know how to manage men.' He laughed a  little to himself complacently. 'No, I couldn't manage Hunter.  They told me last week he was nearly dead with blackwater. I  wonder if he's dead by now. Not one head of cattle to bless  himself with, I'll bet, and no banking account ever opened in his  name. He was quite unmanageable.'    'Ah! But I managed some of them. What about the Canon  Superintendent?' A white-haired vision, creasy-chinned and rosy,  passed before his eyes. 'Toad!' he muttered and kicked the  foot-warmer. 'Even so,' he growled. 'Butter for the clergy, palm-oil  for the laity, big stick for the incorruptible!' His face grew  hard as he thought over some contemplated applications. His face  was little changed in five years save for the wrinkles about the  eyes.    The train drew up at the platform. Julian found a good many  acquaintances as he passed along it. But he was not disposed to  make himself too cheap. Some got a wintry nod, others a summer  smile. One high official who represented big interests got two  minutes' talk and a drink. Then Julian jumped into his mule-cart,  and drove away. He reflected with satisfaction on the quantity  and quality of the greetings that morning. Meanwhile his Cape-boy  coachman whipped up the mules and took him along the main street  in style.    Julian had not been in Rosebery for six months now. He had made  great strides in those months the most momentous of his life.  From being a coming man he had reached the summit of arrival. He  had arrived without a doubt. His company's shares had risen  super-excellently. He had made a big coup at the end"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22914"],[0,"The Sceptical Chymist (#17)"],[1,"ch. The Distillation of Eeles, though it yielded me some Oyle,  and Spirit, and Volatile Salt, besides the _Caput mortuum_, yet were  all these so disproportionate to the Phlegm that came from them (and  in which at first they boyl'd as in a Pot of Water) that they seem'd  to have bin nothing but coagulated Phlegm, which does likewise  strangely abound in Vipers, though they are esteem'd very hot in  Operation, and will in a Convenient Aire survive some dayes the loss  of their Heads and Hearts, so vigorous is their Vivacity. Mans Bloud  it self as Spirituous, and as Elaborate a Liquor as 'tis reputed, does  so abound in Phlegm, that, the other Day, Distilling some of it on  purpose to try the Experiment (as I had formerly done in Deers Bloud)  out of about seven Ounces and a half of pure Bloud we drew neere six  Ounces of Phlegm, before any of the more operative Principles began  to arise, and Invite us to change the Receiver. And to satisfie my  self that some of these Animall Phlegms were void enough of Spirit to  deserve that Name, I would not content my self to taste them only, but  fruitlesly pour'd on them acid Liquors, to try if they contain'd any  Volatile Salt or Spirit, which (had there been any there) would  probably have discover'd it self by making an Ebullition with the  affused Liquor. And now I mention Corrosive Spirits, I am minded to  Informe you, That though they seem to be nothing else but Fluid Salts,  yet they abound in Water, as you may Observe, if either you Entangle,  and so Fix their Saline Part, by making them Corrode some idoneous  Body, or else if you mortifie it with a contrary Salt; as I have very  manifestly Observ'd in the making a Medecine somewhat like _Helmont's  Balsamus Samech_, with Distill'd Vinager instead of Spirit of Wine,  wherewith he prepares it: For you would scarce Beleeve (what I have  lately Observ'd) that of that acid Spirit, the Salt of Tartar, from  which it is Distill'd, will by mortifying and retaining the acid Salt  turn into worthless Phlegm neere twenty times its weight, before it be  so fully Impregnated as to rob no more Distill'd Vinager of its Salt.  And though Spirit of Wine Exquisitely rectify'd seem of all Liquors to  be the most free from Water, it being so Igneous that it will Flame  all away without leaving the least Drop behinde it, yet even this  Fiery Liquor is by _Helmont_ not improbably affirm'd, in case what he  relates be True, to be Materially Water, under a Sulphureous Disguise:  For, according to him, in the making that excellent Medecine,  _Paracelsus_ his _Balsamus Samech_, (which is nothing but _Sal  Tartari_ dulcify'd by Distilling from it Spirit of Wine till the Salt  be sufficiently glutted with its Sulphur, and suffer [Errata: and till  it suffer] the Liquor to be drawn off, as strong as it was pour'd on)  when the Salt of Tartar from which it is Distill'd hath retain'd, or  depriv'd it of the Sulphureous parts of the Spirit of Wine, the rest,  which is incomparably the greater part of the Liquor, will remigrate  into Phlegm. I added that Clause [_In case what he Relates be True_]  because I have not as yet sufficiently try'd it my self. But not only  something of Experiment keeps me from thinking it, as many Chymists  do, absurd, (though I have, as well as they, in vain try'd it with  ordinary Salt of Tartar;) but besides that _Helmont_ often Relates it,  and draws Consequences from it; A Person noted for his Sobernesse and  Skill in Spagyrical Preparations, having been askt by me, Whether the  Experiment might not be made to succeed, if the Salt and Spirit were  prepar'd according to a way suitable to my Principles, he affirm'd to  me, that he had that way I propos'd made _Helmont's_ Experiment  succeed very well, without adding any thing to the Salt and Spirit.  But our way is neither short nor Easie.    I have indeed (sayes _Carneades_) sometimes wonder'd to see how much  Phlegme may be obtain'd from Bodies by the Fire. But concerning that  Phlegme I may anon have Occasion to note something, which I therefore  shall not now anticipate. But to return to the Opinion of _Thales_,  and of _Helmont_, I consider, that supposing the _Alkahest_ could  reduce all Bodies into water, yet whether that water, because insipid,  must be Elementary, may not groundlesly be doubted; For I remember  the Candid and Eloquent _Petrus Laurembergius_ in his Notes upon  _Sala's_ Aphorismes affirmes, that he saw an insipid _Menstruum_ that  was a powerfull Dissolvent, and (if my Memory do not much mis-informe  me) could dissolve Gold. And the water which may be Drawn from  Quicksilver without Addition, though it be almost Tastless, You will I  believe think of a differing Nature from simple Water, especially if  you Digest in it Appropriated Mineralls. To which I shall add but  this, that this Consideration may be further extended. For I see no  Necessity to conceive that the Water mention'd in the Beginning of  _Genesis_, as the Universal Matter, was simple and Elementary Water;  since though we should Suppose it to have been an Agitated Congeries  or Heap consisting of a great Variety of Seminal Principles and  Rudiments, and of other Corpuscles fit to be subdu'd and Fashion'd by  them, it might yet be a Body Fluid like Water, in case the Corpuscles  it was made up of, were by their Creator made small enough, and put  into such an actuall Motion as might make them Glide along one  another. And as we now say, the Sea consists of Water, notwithstanding  [Errata: (notwithstanding] the Saline, Terrestrial, and other Bodies  mingl'd with it,) such a Liquor may well enough be called Water,  because that was the greatest of the known Bodies whereunto it was  like; Though, that a Body may be Fluid enough to appear a Liquor, and  yet contain Corpuscles of a very differing Nature, You will easily  believe, if You but expose a good Quantity of Vitriol in a strong  Vessel to a Competent Fire. For although it contains both Aqueous,  Earthy, Saline, Sulphureous, and Metalline Corpuscles, yet the whole  Mass will at first be Fluid like water, and boyle like a seething pot.    I might easily (Continues _Carneades_) enlarge my self on such  Considerations, if I were Now Oblig'd to give You my Judgment of the  _Thalesian_, and _Helmontian_, _Hypothesis_. But Whether or no we  conclude that all things were at first Generated of Water, I may  Deduce from what I have try'd Concerning the Growth of Vegetables,  nourish'd with water, all that I now propos'd to my Self or need at  present to prove, namely that Salt, Spirit, Earth, and ev'n Oyl  (though that be thought of all Bodies the most opposite to Water) may  be produc'd out of Water; and consequently that a Chymical Principle  as well as a Peripatetick Element, may (in some cases) be Generated  anew, or obtain'd from such a parcel of Matter as was not endow'd with  the form of such a principle or Element before.    And having thus, _Eleutherius_, Evinc'd that 'tis possible that such  Substances as those that Chymists are wont to call their _Tria Prima_,  may be Generated, anew: I must next Endeavour to make it Probable,  that the Operation of the Fire does Actually (sometimes) not only  divide Compounded Bodies into smal Parts, but Compound those Parts  after a new Manner; whence Consequently, for ought we Know, there may  Emerge as well Saline and Sulphureous Substances, as Bodies of other  Textures. And perhaps it will assist us in our Enquiry after the  Effects of the Operations of the Fire upon other Bodies, to Consider a  little, what it does to those Mixtures which being Productions of the  Art of Man, We best know the Composition of. You may then be pleas'd  to take Notice that though Sope is made up by the Sope-Boylers of Oyle  or Grease, and Salt, and Water Diligently Incorporated together, yet  if You expose the Mass they Constitute to a Graduall Fire in a Retort,  You shall then indeed make a Separation, but not of the same  Substances that were United into Sope, but of others of a Distant and  yet not an Elementary Nature, and especially of an Oyle very sharp and  Faetid, and of a very Differing Quality from that which was Employ'd to  make the Sope: fo [Errata: so] if you Mingle in a due Proportion, _Sal  Armoniack_ with Quick-Lime, and Distill them by Degrees of Fire, You  shall not Divide the _Sal Armoniack_ from the Quick-Lime, though the  one be a Volatile, and the other a Fix'd Substance, but that which  will ascend will be a Spirit much more Fugitive, Penetrant, and  stinking, then _Sal Armoniack_; and there will remain with the  Quick-Lime all or very near all the Sea Salt that concurr'd to make up  the _Sal Armoniack_; concerning which Sea Salt I shall, to satisfie  You how well it was United to the Lime, informe You, that I have by  making the Fire at length very Vehement, caus'd both the Ingredients  to melt in the Retort it self into one Mass and such Masses are apt to  Relent in the Moist Air. If it be here Objected, that these Instances  are taken from factitious Concretes which are more Compounded then  those which Nature produces; I shall reply, that besides that I have  Mention'd them as much to Illustrate what I propos'd, as to prove it,  it will be Difficult to Evince that Nature her self does not make  Decompound Bodies, I mean mingle together such mixt Bodies as are  already Compounded of Elementary, or rather of more simple ones. For  Vitriol (for Instance) though I have sometimes taken it out of  Minerall Earths, where Nature had without any assistance of Art  prepar'd it to my Hand, is really, though Chymists are pleas'd to  reckon it among Salts, a De-compounded Body Consisting (as I shall  have occasion to declare anon) of a Terrestriall Substance, of a  Metal, and also of at least one Saline Body, of a peculiar and not  Elementary Nature. And we see also in Animals, that their blood may  be compos'd of Divers very Differing Mixt Bodies, since we find it  observ'd that"]]]
