[Note 63: A line of Griboyedoff's. (Woe from Wit.)]    XII    Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,  The bard his answer waits at home,  But lo! his braggart neighbour hath  Triumphant with the answer come.  Now for the jealous youth what joy!  He feared the criminal might try  To treat the matter as a jest,  Use subterfuge, and thus his breast  From the dread pistol turn away.  But now all doubt was set aside,  Unto the windmill he must ride  To-morrow before break of day,  To cock the pistol; barrel bend  On thigh or temple, friend on friend.    XIII    Resolved the flirt to cast away,  The foaming Lenski would refuse,  To see his Olga ere the fray--  His watch, the sun in turn he views--  Finally tost his arms in air  And lo! he is already there!  He deemed his coming would inspire  Olga with trepidation dire.  He was deceived. Just as before  The miserable bard to meet,  As hope uncertain and as sweet,  Olga ran skipping from the door.  She was as heedless and as gay--  Well! just as she was yesterday.    XIV    \"Why did you leave last night so soon?\"  Was the first question Olga made,  Lenski, into confusion thrown,  All silently hung down his head.  Jealousy and vexation took  To flight before her radiant look,  Before such fond simplicity  And mental elasticity.  He eyed her with a fond concern,  Perceived that he was still beloved,  Already by repentance moved  To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;  But trembles, words he cannot find,  Delighted, almost sane in mind.    XV    But once more pensive and distressed  Beside his Olga doth he grieve,  Nor enough strength of mind possessed  To mention the foregoing eve,  He mused: \"I will her saviour be!  With ardent sighs and flattery  The vile seducer shall not dare  The freshness of her heart impair,  Nor shall the caterpillar come  The lily's stem to eat away,  Nor shall the bud of yesterday  Perish when half disclosed its bloom!\"--  All this, my friends, translate aright:  \"I with my friend intend to fight!\"    XVI    If he had only known the wound  Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,  And if Tattiana mine had found--  If the poor maiden could have guessed  That the two friends with morning's light  Above the yawning grave would fight,--  Ah! it may be, affection true  Had reconciled the pair anew!  But of this love, e'en casually,  As yet none had discovered aught;  Eugene of course related nought,  Tattiana suffered secretly;  Her nurse, who could have made a guess,  Was famous for thick-headedness.    XVII    Lenski that eve in thought immersed,  Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,  But he who by the Muse was nursed  Is ever thus. With frowning brow  To the pianoforte he moves  And various chords upon it proves,  Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:  \"I'm happy, say, is it not so?\"--  But it grew late; he must not stay;  Heavy his heart with anguish grew;  To the young girl he said adieu,  As it were, tore himself away.  Gazing into his face, she said:  \"What ails thee?\"--\"Nothing.\"--He is fled.    XVIII    At home arriving he addressed  His care unto his pistols' plight,  Replaced them in their box, undressed  And Schiller read by candlelight.  But one thought only filled his mind,  His mournful heart no peace could find,  Olga he sees before his eyes  Miraculously fair arise,  Vladimir closes up his book,  And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit  With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat  And flowed harmoniously. He took  And spouted it with lyric fire--  Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.    XIX    Destiny hath preserved his lay.  I have it. Lo! the very thing!  \"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,  Ye golden days of my young spring?  What will the coming dawn reveal?  In vain my anxious eyes appeal;  In mist profound all yet is hid.  So be it! Just the laws which bid  The fatal bullet penetrate,  Or innocently past me fly.  Good governs all! The hour draws nigh  Of life or death predestinate.  Blest be the labours of the light,  And blest the shadows of the night.    XX    \"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,  Bright day will then begin to burn,  But the dark sepulchre I may  Have entered never to return.  The memory of the bard, a dream,  Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;  Men will forget me, but my urn  To visit, lovely maid, return,  O'er my remains to drop a tear,  And think: here lies who loved me well,  For consecrate to me he fell  In the dawn of existence drear.  Maid whom my heart desires alone,  Approach, approach; I am thine own.\"    XXI    Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,(64)  He wrote ('tis the romantic style,  Though of romance therein I fail  To see aught--never mind meanwhile)  And about dawn upon his breast  His weary head declined at rest,  For o'er a word to fashion known,  \"Ideal,\" he had drowsy grown.  But scarce had sleep's soft witchery  Subdued him, when his neighbour stept  Into the chamber where he slept  And wakened him with the loud cry:  \"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.  Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like.\"    [Note 64: The fact of the above words being italicised suggests  the idea that the poet is here firing a Parthian shot at some  unfriendly critic.]    XXII    He was in error; for Eugene  Was sleeping then a sleep like death;  The pall of night was growing thin,  To Lucifer the cock must breathe  His song, when still he slumbered deep,  The sun had mounted high his steep,  A passing snowstorm wreathed away  With pallid light, but Eugene lay  Upon his couch insensibly;  Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.  But finally he oped his eyes  And turned aside the drapery;  He gazed upon the clock which showed  He long should have been on the road.    XXIII    He rings in haste; in haste arrives  His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,  Who dressing-gown and slippers gives  And linen on him doth bestow.  Dressing as quickly as he can,  Eugene directs the trusty man  To accompany him and to escort  A box of terrible import.  Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:  He enters: to the mill he drives:  Descends, the order Guillot gives,  The fatal tubes Lepage contrived(65)  To bring behind: the triple steeds  To two young oaks the coachman leads.    [Note 65: Lepage--a celebrated gunmaker of former days.]    XXIV    Lenski the foeman's apparition  Leaning against the dam expects,  Zaretski, village mechanician,  In the meantime the mill inspects.  Oneguine his excuses says;  \"But,\" cried Zaretski in amaze,  \"Your second you have left behind!\"  A duellist of classic mind,  Method was dear unto his heart  He would not that a man ye slay  In a lax or informal way,  But followed the strict rules of art,  And ancient usages observed  (For which our praise he hath deserved).    XXV    \"My second!\" cried in turn Eugene,  \"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;  To this arrangement can be seen,  No obstacle of which I know.  Although unknown to fame mayhap,  He's a straightforward little chap.\"  Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,  But to Vladimir Eugene saith:  \"Shall we commence?\"--\"Let it be so,\"  Lenski replied, and soon they be  Behind the mill. Meantime ye see  Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot  In consultation stand aside--  The foes with downcast eyes abide.    XXVI    Foes! Is it long since friendship rent  Asunder was and hate prepared?  Since leisure was together spent,  Meals, secrets, occupations shared?  Now, like hereditary foes,  Malignant fury they disclose,  As in some frenzied dream of fear  These friends cold-bloodedly draw near  Mutual destruction to contrive.  Cannot they amicably smile  Ere crimson stains their hands defile,  Depart in peace and friendly live?  But fashionable hatred's flame  Trembles at artificial shame.    XXVII    The shining pistols are uncased,  The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,  Bullets are down the barrels pressed,  For the first time the hammer clicks.  Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,  The powder in the pan is laid,  The sharp flint, screwed securely on,  Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,  Guillot behind a pollard stood;  Aside the foes their mantles threw,  Zaretski paces thirty-two  Measured with great exactitude.  At each extreme one takes his stand,  A loaded pistol in his hand.    XXVIII    \"Advance!\"--            Indifferent and sedate,  The foes, as yet not taking aim,  With measured step and even gait  Athwart the snow four paces came--  Four deadly paces do they span;  Oneguine slowly then began  To raise his pistol to his eye,  Though he advanced unceasingly.  And lo! five paces more they pass,  And Lenski, closing his left eye,  Took aim--but as immediately  Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!  The poet's hour hath sounded--See!  He drops his pistol silently.    XXIX    He on his bosom gently placed  His hand, and fell. His clouded eye  Not agony, but death expressed.  So from the mountain lazily  The avalanche of snow first bends,  Then glittering in the sun descends.  The cold sweat bursting from his brow,  To the youth Eugene hurried now--  Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!  He was no more! The youthful bard  For evermore had disappeared.  The storm was hushed. The blossom fair  Was withered ere the morning light--  The altar flame was quenched in night.    XXX    Tranquil he lay, and strange to view  The peace which on his forehead beamed,  His breast was riddled through and through,  The blood gushed from the wound and steamed  Ere this but one brief moment beat  That heart with inspiration sweet  And enmity and hope and love--  The blood boiled and the passions strove.  Now, as in a deserted house,  All dark and silent hath become;  The inmate is for ever dumb,  The windows whitened, shutters close--  Whither departed is the host?  God knows! The very trace is lost.

Thereupon, with  his usual audacity, he presented himself at the house, walked in,  and although he was clothed in tatters, introduced himself, told his  father's name and circumstances, and wept bitterly.    The good man was much astonished, and not less grieved, to see the son  of his old friend in such woful plight. He rose up, however, embraced  the youth, and asked the reason of his coming.    \"I freighted a vessel,\" said the false hunchback, \"for the purpose  of trading to a certain land. Having gone there, I disposed of my  merchandise, and, taking another cargo, I was on my voyage home.  Suddenly a great storm arose, and the vessel was wrecked, and I escaped  on a plank, and after a time arrived here. But I am ashamed, since I  have lost all my wealth, and I cannot show my face in this plight in my  own city. My excellent father would have consoled me with his pity. But  now that I have carried him and my mother to Ganges,[75] every one will  turn against me; they will rejoice in my misfortunes, they will accuse  me of folly and recklessness--alas! alas! I am truly miserable.\"    My dear master was deceived by the cunning of the wretch. He offered him  hospitality, which was readily enough accepted, and he entertained him  for some time as a guest. Then, having reason to be satisfied with his  conduct, Hemgupt admitted him to his secrets, and finally made him a  partner in his business. Briefly, the villain played his cards so well,  that at last the merchant said to himself:    \"I have had for years an anxiety and a calamity in my house. My  neighbours whisper things to my disadvantage, and those who are bolder  speak out with astonishment amongst themselves, saying, 'At seven or  eight, people marry their daughters, and this indeed is the appointment  of the law: that period is long since gone; she is now thirteen or  fourteen years old, and she is very tall and lusty, resembling a married  woman of thirty. How can her father eat his rice with comfort and sleep  with satisfaction, whilst such a disreputable thing exists in his  house? At present he is exposed to shame, and his deceased friends are  suffering through his retaining a girl from marriage beyond the period  which nature has prescribed.' And now, while I am sitting quietly at  home, the Bhagwan (Deity) removes all my uneasiness: by his favour such  an opportunity occurs. It is not right to delay. It is best that I shall  give my daughter in marriage to him. Whatever can be done to-day is  best; who knows what may happen to-morrow?\"    Thus thinking, the old man went to his wife and said to her, \"Birth,  marriage, and death are all under the direction of the gods; can anyone  say when they will be ours? We want for our daughter a young man who is  of good birth, rich and handsome, clever and honourable. But we do not  find him. If the bridegroom be faulty, thou sayest, all will go wrong.  I cannot put a string round the neck of our daughter and throw her into  the ditch. If, however, thou think well of the merchant's son, now my  partner, we will celebrate Ratnawati's marriage with him.\"    The wife, who had been won over by the hunchback's hypocrisy, was also  pleased, and replied, \"My lord! when the Deity so plainly indicates his  wish, we should do it; since, though we have sat quietly at home, the  desire of our hearts is accomplished. It is best that no delay be made:  and, having quickly summoned the family priest, and having fixed upon a  propitious planetary conjunction, that the marriage be celebrated.\"    Then they called their daughter--ah, me! what a beautiful being she was,  and worthy the love of a Gandharva (demigod). Her long hair, purple with  the light of youth, was glossy as the bramra's[76] wing; her brow was  pure and clear as the agate; the ocean-coral looked pale beside her  lips, and her teeth were as two chaplets of pearls. Everything in her  was formed to be loved. Who could look into her eyes without wishing  to do it again? Who could hear her voice without hoping that such music  would sound once more? And she was good as she was fair. Her father  adored her; her mother, though a middle-aged woman, was not envious or  jealous of her; her relatives doted on her, and her friends could  find no fault with her. I should never end were I to tell her precious  qualities. Alas, alas! my poor Ratnawati!    So saying, the jay wept abundant tears; then she resumed:    When her parents informed my mistress of their resolution, she replied,  \"Sadhu-it is well!\" She was not like most young women, who hate nothing  so much as a man whom their seniors order them to love. She bowed  her head and promised obedience, although, as she afterwards told  her mother, she could hardly look at her intended, on account of his  prodigious ugliness. But presently the hunchback's wit surmounted her  disgust. She was grateful to him for his attention to her father and  mother; she esteemed him for his moral and religious conduct; she pitied  him for his misfortunes, and she finished with forgetting his face,  legs, and back in her admiration of what she supposed to be his mind.    She had vowed before marriage faithfully to perform all the duties of a  wife, however distasteful to her they might be; but after the nuptials,  which were not long deferred, she was not surprised to find that she  loved her husband. Not only did she omit to think of his features  and figure; I verily believe that she loved him the more for his  repulsiveness. Ugly, very ugly men prevail over women for two reasons.  Firstly, we begin with repugnance, which in the course of nature turns  to affection; and we all like the most that which, when unaccustomed to  it, we most disliked. Hence the poet says, with as much truth as is in  the male:              Never despair, O man! when woman's spite            Detests thy name and sickens at thy sight:            Sometime her heart shall learn to love thee more            For the wild hatred which it felt before, &c.    Secondly, the very ugly man appears, deceitfully enough, to think little  of his appearance, and he will give himself the trouble to pursue  a heart because he knows that the heart will not follow after him.  Moreover, we women (said the jay) are by nature pitiful, and this our  enemies term a \"strange perversity.\" A widow is generally disconsolate  if she loses a little, wizen-faced, shrunken shanked, ugly, spiteful,  distempered thing that scolded her and quarrelled with her, and beat her  and made her hours bitter; whereas she will follow her husband to Ganges  with exemplary fortitude if he was brave, handsome, generous----    \"Either hold your tongue or go on with your story,\" cried the warrior  king, in whose mind these remarks awakened disagreeable family  reflections.    \"Hi! hi! hi!\" laughed the demon; \"I will obey your majesty, and make  Madan-manjari, the misanthropical jay, proceed.\"    Yes, she loved the hunchback; and how wonderful is our love! quoth the  jay. A light from heaven which rains happiness on this dull, dark earth!  A spell falling upon the spirit, which reminds us of a higher existence!  A memory of bliss! A present delight! An earnest of future felicity!  It makes hideousness beautiful and stupidity clever, old age young and  wickedness good, moroseness amiable, and low-mindedness magnanimous,  perversity pretty and vulgarity piquant. Truly it is sovereign alchemy  and excellent flux for blending contradictions is our love, exclaimed  the jay.    And so saying, she cast a triumphant look at the parrot, who only  remarked that he could have desired a little more originality in her  remarks.    For some months (resumed Madan-manjari), the bride and the bridegroom  lived happily together in Hemgupt's house. But it is said:              Never yet did the tiger become a lamb;    and the hunchback felt that the edge of his passions again wanted  blunting. He reflected, \"Wisdom is exemption from attachment, and  affection for children, wife, and home.\" Then he thus addressed my poor  young mistress:    \"I have been now in thy country some years, and I have heard no tidings  of my own family, hence my mind is sad, I have told thee everything  about myself; thou must now ask thy mother leave for me to go to my own  city, and, if thou wishest, thou mayest go with me.\"    Ratnawati lost no time in saying to her mother, \"My husband wishes to  visit his own country; will you so arrange that he may not be pained  about this matter?\"    The mother went to her husband, and said, \"Your son-in-law desires leave  to go to his own country.\"    Hemgupt replied, \"Very well; we will grant him leave. One has no power  over another man's son. We will do what he wishes.\"    The parents then called their daughter, and asked her to tell them her  real desire-whether she would go to her father-in-law's house, or would  remain in her mother's home. She was abashed at this question, and could  not answer; but she went back to her husband, and said, \"As my father  and mother have declared that you should do as you like, do not leave me  behind.\"    Presently the merchant summoned his son-in-law, and having bestowed  great wealth upon him, allowed him to depart. He also bade his daughter  farewell, after giving her a palanquin and a female slave. And the  parents took leave of them with wailing and bitter tears; their hearts  were like to break. And so was mine.    For some days the hunchback travelled quietly along with his wife, in  deep thought. He could not take her to his city, where she would find  out his evil life, and the fraud which he had passed upon her father.  Besides which, although he wanted her money, he by no means wanted her  company for life. After turning on many projects in his evil-begotten  mind, he hit upon the following:    He"]]]
