There was great rejoicing in the King's house, and in the King's heart,  too, for he had given up hope of ever seeing any of his sons again.    The King was so charmed with the Princess that he said it was a pity  that she couldn't marry his oldest son so that she might one day be  Queen.    \"The Youngest Prince is a capable young man,\" the King said, \"and  there's no denying that he managed this business of killing the dragon  very neatly. But he is after all only the Youngest Prince with very  little hope of succeeding to the kingdom. If you hadn't married him in  such haste one of his older brothers might easily have fallen in love  with you.\"    \"I don't regret my haste,\" the Princess said. \"Besides he is now my  father's heir. But that doesn't matter for I should be happy with the  Youngest Prince if he were only a shepherd.\"          THE LITTLE SINGING FROG    [Illustration]    _The Story of a Girl Whose Parents Were Ashamed of Her_          THE LITTLE SINGING FROG      There was once a poor laborer and his wife who had no children. Every  day the woman would sigh and say:    \"If only we had a child!\"    Then the man would sigh, too, and say:    \"It would be pleasant to have a little daughter, wouldn't it?\"    At last they went on a pilgrimage to a holy shrine and there they prayed  God to give them a child.    \"Any kind of a child!\" the woman prayed. \"I'd be thankful for a child of  our own even if it were a frog!\"    God heard their prayer and sent them a little daughter--not a little  girl daughter, however, but a little frog daughter. They loved their  little frog child dearly and played with her and laughed and clapped  their hands as they watched her hopping about the house. But when the  neighbors came in and whispered: \"Why, that child of theirs is nothing  but a frog!\" they were ashamed and they decided that when people were  about they had better keep their child hidden in a closet.    So the frog girl grew up without playmates of her own age, seeing only  her father and mother. She used to play about her father as he worked.  He was a vine-dresser in a big vineyard and of course it was great fun  for the little frog girl to hop about among the vines.    Every day at noontime the woman used to come to the vineyard carrying  her husband's dinner in a basket. The years went by and she grew old and  feeble and the daily trip to the vineyard began to tire her and the  basket seemed to her to grow heavier and heavier.    \"Let me help you, mother,\" the frog daughter said. \"Let me carry  father's dinner to him and you sit home and rest.\"    So from that time on the frog girl instead of the old woman carried the  dinner basket to the vineyard. While the old man ate, the frog girl  would hop up into the branches of a tree and sing. She sang very sweetly  and her old father, when he petted her, used to call her his Little  Singing Frog.    Now one day while she was singing the Tsar's Youngest Son rode by and  heard her. He stopped his horse and looked this way and that but for the  life of him he couldn't see who it was who was singing so sweetly.    \"Who is singing?\" he asked the old man.    But the old man who, as I told you before, was ashamed of his frog  daughter before strangers, at first pretended not to hear and then, when  the young Prince repeated his question, answered gruffly:    \"There's no one singing!\"    But the next day at the same hour when the Prince was again riding by he  heard the same sweet voice and he stopped again and listened.    \"Surely, old man,\" he said, \"there is some one singing! It is a lovely  girl, I know it is! Why, if I could find her, I'd be willing to marry  her at once and take her home to my father, the Tsar!\"    \"Don't be rash, young man,\" the laborer said.    \"I mean what I say!\" the Prince declared. \"I'd marry her in a minute!\"    \"Are you sure you would?\"    \"Yes, I'm sure!\"    \"Very well, then, we'll see.\"    The old man looked up into the tree and called:    \"Come down, Little Singing Frog! A Prince wants to marry you!\"    So the little frog girl hopped down from among the branches and stood  before the Prince.    \"She's my own daughter,\" the laborer said, \"even if she does look like a  frog.\"    \"I don't care what she looks like,\" the Prince said. \"I love her  singing and I love her. And I mean what I say: I'll marry her if she'll  marry me. My father, the Tsar, bids me and my brothers present him our  brides to-morrow. He bids all the brides bring him a flower and he says  he'll give the kingdom to the prince whose bride brings the loveliest  flower. Little Singing Frog, will you be my bride and will you come to  Court to-morrow bringing a flower?\"    \"Yes, my Prince,\" the frog girl said, \"I will. But I must not shame you  by hopping to Court in the dust. I must ride. So, will you send me a  snow-white cock from your father's barnyard?\"    \"I will,\" the Prince promised, and before night the snow-white cock had  arrived at the laborer's cottage.    Early the next morning the frog girl prayed to the Sun.    \"O golden Sun,\" she said, \"I need your help! Give me some lovely clothes  woven of your golden rays for I would not shame my Prince when I go to  Court.\"    The Sun heard her prayer and gave her a gown of cloth of gold.    Instead of a flower she took a spear of wheat in her hand and then when  the time came she mounted the white cock and rode to the palace.    [Illustration: _This, the Bride of the Youngest Prince, Is My Choice_]    The guards at the palace gate at first refused to admit her.    \"This is no place for frogs!\" they said to her. \"You're looking for a  pond!\"    But when she told them she was the Youngest Prince's bride, they were  afraid to drive her away. So they let her ride through the gate.    \"Strange!\" they murmured to one another. \"The Youngest Prince's bride!  She looks like a frog and that was certainly a cock she was riding,  wasn't it?\"    They stepped inside the gates to look after her and then they saw an  amazing sight. The frog girl, still seated on the white cock, was  shaking out the folds of a golden gown. She dropped the gown over her  head and instantly there was no frog and no white cock but a lovely  maiden mounted on a snow-white horse!    Well, the frog girl entered the palace with two other girls, the  promised brides of the older princes. They were just ordinary girls both  of them. To see them you wouldn't have paid any attention to them one  way or the other. But standing beside the lovely bride of the Youngest  Prince they seemed more ordinary than ever.    The first girl had a rose in her hand. The Tsar looked at it and at her,  sniffed his nose slightly, and turned his head.    The second girl had a carnation. The Tsar looked at her for a moment and  murmured:    \"Dear me, this will never do!\"    Then he looked at the Youngest Prince's bride and his eye kindled and he  said:    \"Ah! This is something like!\"    She gave him the spear of wheat and he took it and held it aloft. Then  he reached out his other hand to her and had her stand beside him as he  said to his sons and all the Court:    \"This, the bride of the Youngest Prince, is my choice! See how beautiful  she is! And yet she knows the useful as well as the beautiful for she  has brought me a spear of wheat! The Youngest Prince shall be the Tsar  after me and she shall be Tsarina!\"    So the little frog girl of whom her parents were ashamed married the  Youngest Prince and when the time came wore a Tsarina's crown.    [Illustration]          THE NIGHTINGALE IN THE MOSQUE    [Illustration]    _The Story of the Sultan's Youngest Son and the Princess Flower o' the  World_          THE NIGHTINGALE IN THE MOSQUE      There was once a Sultan who was so pious and devout that he spent many  hours every day in prayer.    \"For the glory of Allah,\" he thought to himself, \"I ought to build the  most beautiful mosque in the world.\"    So he called together the finest artisans in the country and told them  what he wanted. He spent a third of his riches on the undertaking, and  when the mosque was finished everybody said:    \"See now, our Sultan has built the most beautiful mosque in the world  for the greater glory of Allah!\"    On the first day when the Sultan went to pray in the new mosque, a  Dervish who was sitting cross-legged at the entrance spoke to him in a  droning sing-song voice and said:    \"Nay, but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough! There is something it  lacks and your prayers will be unavailing!\"    The words of the holy man grieved the Sultan and he had the mosque torn  down and another built in its place even more beautiful.    \"This is certainly the most beautiful mosque in the world!\" the people  said, and the Sultan's heart was very happy on the first day as he went  in to pray.    But again the Dervish, seated at the entrance, said to him in his  droning, sing-song voice:    \"Nay, but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough! There is something it  lacks and your prayers will be unavailing!\"    At the holy man's words the Sultan had the second mosque torn down and a  third one built, the most beautiful of them all. But when it was  finished for a third time the Dervish droned out:    \"Nay, but your mosque is not yet beautiful enough! There is something it  lacks and your prayers will be unavailing!\"    \"What can I do?\" the Sultan cried. \"I have spent all my riches and now I  have no means wherewith to build another mosque!\"    He fell to grieving and nothing any one could say would comfort him.    His three sons came to him and said:    \"Father, is there not something we can do for you?\"    The Sultan sighed and shook his head.    \"Nothing, my sons, unless indeed you were to find out for me why my  third mosque is not the most beautiful in the world.\"    \"Brothers,\" the youngest suggested, \"let us go to the Dervish and ask  him why it is that the third mosque is not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#17)"],[1," and impetus  carried all before them. Not a blow was struck. Horse and rider  went down before them, or were swept aside. They were scarcely  conscious that they were through, before they encountered the  second line.    Here the fight was much more severe. Fergus cut down two of his  opponents and, with a pistol shot, rid Karl of an antagonist who  was pressing him hard; and after a minute of wild confusion they  were through the line, and riding at headlong speed towards the  Prussians. Pistols cracked out behind them, but before the  Austrians had time to turn and aim they were already fifty yards  away, and going at a speed that soon left their pursuers behind. As  soon as the latter saw this they drew off, and trotted back to  Lobositz.    Fergus rode up to the officer commanding the cavalry.    \"I bear the king's orders to you, general, to retire at once with  your command.\"    It was time, for a body of Austrian cavalry, of much greater  strength, could be seen galloping towards them from the high ground  half a mile distant. In half a minute the Prussians were in motion  but, as they returned, the storm of fire from the two villages  burst out again with redoubled violence. Men and horses rolled over  but, closing up quickly, the squadrons swept on.    The general remained stationary until his last squadron thundered  by, and then galloped forward again and took his place at their  head. Fergus had followed him, when there was a sudden crash, and  he was thrown with tremendous force over his horse's head, and  there lay stunned with the shock.    When he recovered he staggered to his feet, and saw that he was  surrounded by Austrian cavalry; these having halted just where he  fell, as pursuit of the Prussians was hopeless, and the balls from  the Prussian batteries were falling thick.    \"You are our prisoner, sir,\" an officer said to him.    \"So I see,\" Fergus said bitterly. \"It is hard luck, just at the  beginning of the campaign.\"    \"It is the fortune of war,\" the Austrian said with a smile; \"and  indeed, I don't think that you have any reason to grumble for, had  that shot struck a few inches farther back, it would have carried  off both your legs.\"    A sharp order was now given to retire. One of the troopers was  ordered to give his horse to Fergus, and to mount behind a comrade;  and they rode back to the Austrian main position, on the rising  ground. Fergus was at once taken to the marshal in command of the  Austrians.    \"What is your name, sir?\" the latter asked.    \"Fergus Drummond. I have the honour to be an aide-de-camp on  Marshal Keith's staff.\"    \"A Scotchman, I suppose?\" the marshal said, breaking into English.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"What force is there opposed to us?\"    \"That I cannot say, sir. I only joined the army two days ago, and  have been on the march ever since.\"    \"Who is its commander?\"    \"Marshal Keith, sir; but the king himself is with it.\"    \"I will see that you are made comfortable, presently, Mr. Drummond.    \"Captain Wingratz, will you conduct this officer to the rear, and  place a couple of soldiers to see that he is not annoyed or  interfered with, in any way?\"    Fergus was led away. Captain Wingratz called up two troopers and,  choosing an elevated spot of ground, told them to dismount and  allow no one to speak to the officer.    \"From here,\" he said courteously to Drummond, \"you will get a view  of the field of battle.\"    Fergus sat down on the grass, and remained a spectator of the fight  to the end of the day. He marked at once that the combat had rolled  down the hill, and that the Prussians were making their way in  force towards Lobositz. Then he saw heavy masses of infantry, from  the Austrian right, move forward to aid in its defence. For two  hours the battle raged round the village, the whole of the guns on  both sides aiding in the fight. Then volumes of smoke and flame  rose, and the Austrians were seen retiring. Sulowitz still kept up  a heavy fire, and he saw a strong body from the Austrian left move  down there; while the centre advanced to cover the retreat of the  defenders of Lobositz, and to check the advancing masses of the  Prussians; and he thought, for a time, that a general engagement  was about to take place. Then he saw the Prussian advance cease,  the roar of cannon gradually died away, and the battle was at an  end.    For an hour he remained, apparently unnoticed, then Captain  Wingratz rode up with another officer.    \"I am sorry to have neglected you so long, Lieutenant Drummond; but  you see it was the fault of your own people, who have kept us so  busy. This is Lieutenant Kerr, a compatriot of yours, who will take  special charge of you.\"    \"I am sorry that our meeting cannot take place under more  favourable circumstances,\" Kerr said, holding out his hand. \"It  might well have been the other way.    \"Now come with me to my tent. I have no doubt that you are hungry;  I can assure you that I am.\"    The two walked together for about a quarter of a mile, the Austrian  officer having left as soon as he had introduced them.    \"There were three of us here this morning,\" Kerr said, as they  entered the tent. \"The other two are missing. One I know is killed;  the other badly wounded, but whether he is dead or a prisoner I  cannot say.    \"By the way, are you not the officer who cut his way through the  squadron of our regiment, and went on and joined your cavalry, who  at once fell back? I was in Lobositz, myself. My squadron was not  ordered out. As I hear that you were found by our cavalry as they  followed the Prussians, it struck me that it might be you; although  from Lobositz we could only see that it was a staff uniform that  the officer wore.\"    \"Yes, it was I. I was carrying an order for the cavalry to retire.\"    \"That was what we supposed, as soon as you were seen coming down  the valley; and as it would have suited us much better for the  Prussian cavalry to have stayed where it was for a little longer,  the general sent out a squadron to intercept you. It was a splendid  thing to do, on your part. Of course, there were a number of us  watching from the earthworks, and I can assure you that there was a  general inclination to cheer as you cut your way through our  fellows. I am sure that if I had known that it was a countryman I  should have done it, though the action was at the expense of my own  regiment.    \"Our squadron suffered heavily as they rode back again, for that  battery from the Homolka turned its attention to them, as soon as  you had gone through. They had an officer and nearly thirty men  killed and wounded before they got back into shelter.    \"How long have you been out here?\"    \"Only about two months.\"    \"Really! You are lucky in getting onto Keith's staff.\"    \"He is a cousin of my mother's,\" Fergus said.    \"And he made you lieutenant, and aide-de-camp, at once.\"    \"No. I was first a cornet, but I was promoted at Dresden. The king  had given strict orders about plundering, and it happened that I  came upon some marauders at their work, and had the good fortune to  rescue a gentleman of some importance from their hands; and the  king, who was furious at his orders being disobeyed, himself  promoted me.    \"I had been lucky enough to get myself wounded in the affair. As I  lost a good deal of blood, I looked no doubt a good deal worse than  I was, and I expect that had a good deal to do with my getting the  step.\"    \"Well, you are a lucky fellow. I was eight years a cornet before I  got promoted.\"    \"I think my bad luck, in getting captured, balances my good fortune  in being promoted so soon.\"    \"To some extent perhaps it does, but you will get the benefit when  you return. No doubt Fritz was watching you, as you rode. He must  have seen our cavalry coming down the slope, before the man in  command of your squadrons could have done so; and must have felt  that they were lost, unless his orders were received. He must have  been relieved, indeed, when he saw you reach them.\"    This had indeed been the case. The king and marshal had both been  watching through their glasses the Prussian cavalry, and marked how  the ground behind them was dotted thickly with the bodies of horses  and men.    \"Will they never stop?\" the king said impatiently. \"These cavalry  men are always getting into scrapes with their impetuosity. Gorlitz  must have known that he was only sent forward to ascertain the  position of the Austrians, and not to fight their whole army. He  ought to have turned, as soon as that crossfire of their batteries  opened upon them.\"    \"He knew that your majesty and the whole army would be watching  him, sire,\" Keith said quietly; \"and I fancy that, under such  circumstances, few cavalry men would draw rein till they had done  something worthy of themselves.\"    At this moment the fog wreath moved away.    \"See,\" the king exclaimed, \"there is a great body of Austrian  cavalry moving along behind Sulowitz. That rise behind the village  must hide them from our men.    \"Where is your messenger, Keith?\"    \"There he goes, sire. He is well out of the valley now and, by the  pace he is riding at, he won't be long before he reaches them.\"    \"He won't reach them at all,\" the king said curtly, a minute later.  \"See, there is a squadron of horse riding out from Lobositz, to cut  him off. No doubt they guess what his errand is.\"    \"I see them, sire, and he must see them, too. He is checking his  horse, for his orderly is coming up to him.\"    \"Then the cavalry will be lost,\" the king said. \"The enemy's  batteries are playing havoc with them, and they will have the  Austrians down upon them in a few minutes.    \"Ah! I expect Gorlitz sees them now. Our men are halting, and  forming up. I suppose he means to charge the Austrians when they  come up, but there are three to one against him. He is lost.\"    \"There is hope yet, sire,\" Keith said, as he again turned his glass  on Fergus. \"My aide-de-camp is"]]]
