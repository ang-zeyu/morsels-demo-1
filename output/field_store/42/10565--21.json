Can't say as how I'd like to find out the truth. Look here,  Fenner, we've heard a lot about Captain Bayliss wantin' to make trouble  for _Don_ Cazar. Does everybody believe that?\"    \"Everybody wot ain't blind, deef, or outta their natural-born wits,\"  Fenner replied. \"Bayliss come out here two years ago. 'Fore that, Major  Kenny, he was in command between here an' Tucson. Had him an outpost right  on th' edge o' th' Range. Him an' _Don_ Cazar, they never talked no war,  'cept 'gainst Apaches an' th' _bandidos_. Was there a raid, th' major, he  took out th' troops; and _Don_ Cazar, he took out his riders an' th'  Pimas. 'Tween 'em they give everybody wot wanted a spot of trouble all  they could chew off an' a lot more'n they could swallow. Kept things quiet  even if a man hadda rest his hand on his rifle 'bout twenty-four hours  outta every day.    \"But this here Bayliss--he's been like a mule with a burr under his tail  ever since he hit th' territory. Wants to have th' say 'bout  everything--includin' wot goes on at th' Range--which he ain't never goin'  t' have as long as _Don_ Cazar kin sit th' saddle an' ride. Back in '62  when th' Rebs came poundin' in here, they spoke soft an' nice to _Don_  Cazar. They wanted him to back their play an' see 'em straight on to  Californy. He was from Texas an' them Texas boys jus' naturally thought as  how he'd saddle up an' ride right 'long wi' 'em. Only he said it loud an'  clear--that such ruckusin' round only meant th' whole country here'd go to  pot. When th' army pulled out, th' Apaches got it into their heads as how  they finally licked us good an' proper an' this here was their country fur  th' takin'. Nearly was, too.    \"Then th' Rebs got up on their high horse an' said as how iffen _Don_  Cazar warn't with 'em, then he was agin 'em, an' they would jus' move in  on _him_. He tol' 'em to go ahead an' try. An' seem' as how they was only  one company hereabouts--Howard's Rangers--they didn't try. That's when  Johnny Shannon had his big bust-up with his pa an'--\"    \"His father!\" Drew could not help that exclamation.    \"Wal, _Don_ Cazar ain't Johnny's real pa, o' course. But he shore thinks  th' world an' all of Johnny, raising him up from a li'l cub. Johnny warn't  more'n four o' thereabouts when _Don_ Cazar went back to Texas an' got  him. _Don_ Cazar's been like a pa to Johnny since, an' a mighty good one,  too. But when th' Rangers was round here in '62 Johnny--he had a big row  an' run off to join 'em. Jus' a half-growed kid, not big 'nough to raise a  good brush o' hair on his chin yet. When th' Yankee boys from Californy  came marchin' in an' th' Rebs had to skedaddle--Johnny, he went with 'em.  Didn't see Johnny round here agin till last fall when he came ridin' in  lookin' mighty beat out an' down in th' mouth. But when th' Union men  came, they was thinkin' th' same 'bout _Don_ Cazar. Wanted him to jump  right in an' swim 'longside o' them. But he said as how th' safety of his  people was what was important. He was fightin' Apaches an' holdin' th'  land, an' that was what meant th' most to his thinkin'. Then the Yankees  did a lot of fancy cussin' out 'bout him, trying to make out that he was a  Reb' cause Johnny lit off with th' Southerners.    \"Till they began to discover nothin' much goes on round here lessen _Don_  Cazar has a finger in th' pot. An' they had to swaller a lotta them hot  an' hasty words--stuck heavy in quite a few craws, I reckon.\" Fenner  grinned. \"Only, th' _Don_, he's got agin him now a big list of little men  who'd like to be big chiefs. Every once in a while they gits together an'  makes war talk. Never quite got up guts 'nough to paint their faces an'  hit th' trail, not yet. But did somebody like Bayliss look like he was  beginnin' to make things move, then he'd have a lotta willin' hands to  help him shove. Up to now Johnny's been their best bet at gittin' th'  Range into trouble.\"    Drew turned his head to look Fenner in the eye. \"Now you think we are!\" He  did not know why he uttered that as a challenge; the words just came out  that way.    \"Not any more'n any of us wot can be drawed into a fight in town. You keep  away from Bayliss. He can't come huntin' you without tippin' his hand so  wide he'd never be able to play agin. Hey, here comes somebody poundin'  leather so hard he's gonna beat it right intuh th' ground!\" Fenner pulled  up Tar, flung up his hand to signal the wagons to a halt.    Dust rolled in a cloud with two or three riders at its center. They were  pushing the pace all right. Drew jerked his carbine from its saddle boot,  saw Anse beat him to that action by a scant second or two. But the  newcomers were already drawing rein, bringing their foam-lathered horses  to a pawing stop. A buckskin-clad man mounted on a powerful grulla gelding  faced Fenner, his whole tense body and snapping eyes backing the demand he  made:    \"Where's Johnny?\"    \"Back at town, Rennie, at Doc's. He ain't bad. Got him a head crease wot  knocked him silly for a bit. Doc says a day o' two in bed and then he kin  come home.\"    \"How did it happen?\" That second question was as sharp as the first.    \"Nobody's got it straight outta him yet. Army patrol picked him up on th'  road close to town--looked like he'd been footin' it quite a spell. An' by  that time he didn't know wot he was doin'. Nye got him to Doc's an' they  put him to bed. He ain't said much, 'cept Kitchell jumped him down Long  Canyon way----\"    \"Kitchell!\" Hunt Rennie repeated the name and nodded. \"But ... Long Canyon  ...\" There was a shade of puzzlement in his voice. \"All right, carry on,  Crow. I'll try to get back to the Stronghold before you pull south--if  Johnny's all right. Maybe I can bring him back with me.\"    The grulla made what was close to a standing leap into a gallop and Rennie  flashed along the line of wagons in the opposite direction toward Tubacca.  Fenner signaled once more and the train began the slower trip southward.    Drew sat watching the dust arise again as the trio of riders pounded away.  He could no longer make out individual riders, just the rising dust.  Rennie on his way to Johnny Shannon ... What had Fenner said-\"li'l cub ...  warn't more 'n four.\" Drew Rennie at four--hard to sort out one very early  memory from another. There had been that time Uncle Murray had caught him  down at the creek, making paper boats. How could a child that young know  one kind of paper from another? But Hunt Rennie's son was judged to have  torn up a letter with deliberate malice, not just taken paper found  conveniently on the veranda. Was he four then, or even younger? But he  could remember the punishment very vividly. And the time he'd run off to  see the circus come into town, he and Shelly ... Cousin Jeff, Cousin  Merry, they had tried to beg him off from Grandfather's punishment that  time, not that they had succeeded. Drew Rennie at four, at six, at twelve,  at sixteen--riding out at night with Castleman's Company, weaving a path  south through enemy-occupied territory to join General Morgan--few of those  would-be cavalrymen over twenty-one. Yes, he could remember for Drew  Rennie all the way back.    \"Hey, you plannin' to claim this here range?\" Anse's horse trotted up, and  Drew was suddenly aware that the trailer of the last wagon had already  pulled past him. He tightened rein, and the well-trained horse broke into  a canter.    \"Not hardly.\" He tried to meet Anse's attempt at humor halfway. \"Don't  look too promisin'.\"    \"Lissen here\"--Anse rode so close their spurs were near to hitting--\"you  sure you got hold of th' right end of th' runnin' iron now?\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Well, 'bout Shannon. You heard what Fenner said--Rennie's like a pa to  him. An' maybe ...\" His voice died away.    \"And maybe that's that? He has my place, and it's really his now?\" Drew  asked bleakly. \"Could be.\"    Yes, it could well be that this was a good time to bow out. Maybe he  should not have ridden out of Tubacca at all. Maybe he should have cut out  of the game yesterday.... Or never come down into the valley weeks ago ...  or left Red Springs.... Those \"maybes\" stretched as far back and as neatly  in line as the railroad tracks they had been talking about earlier, one  slipping smoothly into another as if cast in one strong string of doubts.  Just as he had had that moment of disappointment the first time he had  seen Hunt Rennie, so he felt that identical void now, only twice as wide  and deep.    What had he expected, anyway? Some kind of instant recognition on his  father's part? That all the welcoming would be on the other side, breaking  right through the barrier he had been building for years? His feelings  were so illogical he could have laughed at them, only he had no laughter  left. He had not tried to open the door, so why did he care that it  remained firmly shut?    \"Did you ever think about California, Anse? Sounds like a place a man  would like to see.\"    He was conscious that the Texan's horse quickened pace, only to be reined  in again.    \"You thinkin' about cuttin' out? Yesterday----\"    \"Yesterday----\" Drew tried to think back to how he had felt yesterday about  Topham's warning and how he himself had held the absurd belief that if  _Don_ Cazar was going to be in trouble, Drew himself wanted to be there.  That was yesterday. But still he pointed his horse south--to the place  where Hunt Rennie would return, bringing Johnny Shannon.    The Kentuckian fell back on the old \"wait and see.\" He had learned long  since that time took care of a lot of worries. Now he made himself grin at  Anse.    \"Was worryin' about wet feet before my boots were in the river again,\" he  confessed.    \"Don't let it git to be no habit,\" the Texan warned. \"You try ridin'  _with_ th' bumps awhile, not agin"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#17)"],[1,"would be 3' 9\", the  number of board feet in the board.    If the board to be measured is longer than any figure given, divide  the length into two parts and add the result of the two parts obtained  separately. For example, for a board 23' long and 13\" wide,--take  12'x13\" = 13'; add to it, 11'x13\" = 11' 11\"; total, 24'11\".    [Illustration: Fig. 197. Steel Square with Rafter Table.]    A good general rule is to think first whether or not the problem can  be done in one's head without the assistance of the square.    The table is made, as its name, Board-Measure (B. M.) implies, for  measuring boards, which are commonly 1\" thick. For materials more than  1\" thick, multiply the B. M. of one surface by the number of inches  thick the piece measures.    The rafter-table is found on the back of the body of the square, Fig.  197. Auxiliary to it are the twelfth inch graduations, on the outside  edges, which may represent either feet or inches.    [Illustration: Fig. 198. The \"Run\" and \"Rise\" of a Rafter.]    By the \"run\" of the rafter is meant the horizontal distance when it is  set in place from the end of its foot to a plumb line from the ridge  end, i. e., one half the length of the building, Fig. 198. By the  \"rise\" of the rafter is meant the perpendicular distance from the  ridge end to the level of the foot of the rafter. By the pitch is  meant the ratio of the rise to twice the run, i. e., to the total  width of the building. In a 1/2 pitch, the rise equals the run, or 1/2  the width of the building; in a 1/3 pitch the rise is 1/3 the width  of the building; in a 3/4 pitch the rise is 3/4 the width of the  building.    [Illustration: Fig. 199. Lumberman's Board Rule.]    To find the length of a rafter by the use of the table, first find the  required pitch, at the left end of the table. Opposite this and under  the graduation on the edge representing the run in feet, will be found  the length of the rafter; e.g., a rafter having a run of 12' with a  1/4 pitch, is 13' 5\" long, one with a run of 11' and a 1/3 pitch,  is 13' 2-8/12\", one with a run of 7' and a 5/8 pitch, is 11' 2-6/12\"  long, etc.    When the run is in inches, the readings are for 1/12 of the run in  feet: e.g., a rafter with a run of 12\" and a 1/4 pitch is 13-5/12\",  one with a run of 11\" and a 1/3 pitch, is 13-3/12\". Where the run is  in both feet and inches, find the feet and the inches separately; and  add together; e.g., a rafter with a run of 11' 6\", and a 1/2 pitch, is  15' 6-8/12\" + 8-6/12\" = 16' 3-2/12\".    [Illustration: Fig. 200. Try-Square. Fig. 201. Miter-Square. Fig. 202.  Sliding-T Bevel.]    The _lumberman's board-rule_, Fig. 199. To measure wood by it, note  the length of the board in feet at the end of the measure. The dot  nearest the width (measured in inches) gives the B. M. for lumber 1\"  thick.    The _try-square_, Fig. 200, which is most commonly used for measuring  the accuracy of right angles, is also convenient for testing the  width of a board at various places along its length, for making short  measurements, and as a guide in laying out lines with a pencil or  knife at right angles to a surface or edge. The sizes are various and  are indicated by the length of the blade. A convenient size for the  individual bench and for ordinary use has a blade 6\" long. It is also  well to have in the shop one large one with a 12\" blade.    [Illustration: Fig. 203. Using the Try-Square.]    [Illustration: Fig. 204. Scribing with Knife by Try-Square.]    In testing the squareness of work with the try-square, care must be  taken to see that the head rests firmly against the surface from which  the test is made, and then slipped down till the blade touches the  edge being tested, Fig. 203. The edge should be tested at a number  of places in the same way: that is, it should not be slid along the  piece. The try-square is also of great use in scribing lines across  boards, Fig. 204. A good method is to put the point of the knife at  the beginning of the desired line, slide the square, along until it  touches the knife-edge; then, resting the head of the square firmly  against the edge, draw the knife along, pressing it lightly against  the blade, holding it perpendicularly. To prevent the knife from  running away from the blade of the try-square, turn its edge slightly  towards the blade.    The _miter-square_, Fig. 201, is a try-square fixed at an angle of  45 deg.    The _sliding T bevel_, Fig. 202, has a blade adjustable to any angle.  It may be set either from a sample line, drawn on the wood, from  a given line on a protractor, from drawing triangles, from the  graduations on a framing square, or in other ways. It is used  similarly to the T-square.    [Illustration: Fig. 205. Winding-Sticks, 12 inches Long.]    _Winding-sticks_, Fig. 205, consist of a pair of straight strips of  exactly the same width thruout. They are used to find out whether  there is any twist or \"wind\" in a board. This is done by placing them  parallel to each other, one at one end of the board, and the other at  the other end. By sighting across them, one can readily see  whether the board be twisted or not, Fig. 206. The blades of two  framing-squares may be used in the same manner.    [Illustration: Fig. 206. Method of Using the Winding-Sticks.]    _Compasses_ or _dividers_, Fig. 207, consist of two legs turning on  a joint, and having sharpened points. A convenient form is the wing  divider which can be accurately adjusted by set-screws. A pencil can  be substituted for the removable point. They are used for describing  circles and arcs, for spacing, for measuring, for subdividing  distances, and for scribing. In scribing a line parallel with a given  outline, one leg follows the given edge, or outline, and the point  of the other, marks the desired line. Used in this way they are very  convenient for marking out chamfers, especially on curved edges, a  sharp pencil being substituted for the steel point.    The _beam-compass_, Fig. 208, consists of two _trammel-points_ running  on a beam which may be made of any convenient length. It is used for  describing large circles. A pencil may be attached to one point.    _Calipers_, outside and inside, Figs. 209, 210, are necessary for the  accurate gaging of diameters, as in wood-turning.    [Illustration: Fig. 207. Winged Dividers.]    [Illustration: Fig. 208. Beam-Compass or Trammel Points.]    [Illustration: Fig. 209. Outside Calipers.]    [Illustration: Fig. 210. Inside Calipers.]    The _marking-gage_, Fig. 211, consists of a head or block sliding on a  beam or bar, to which it is fixed by means of a set-screw. On the face  of the head is a brass shoe to keep the face from wearing. Projecting  thru the beam is a steel spur or point, which should be filed to a  flat, sharp edge, a little rounded and sharpened on the edge toward  which the gage is to be moved, Fig. 212. It should project about 1/8\"  from the beam. If the spur be at all out of place, as it is likely to  be, the graduations on a beam will be unreliable. Hence it is best to  neglect them entirely when setting the gage and always to measure with  the rule from the head to the spur, Fig. 213.    [Illustration: Fig. 211. Marking-Gage.]    [Illustration: Fig. 212. Spur of Marking-Gage.]    In use the beam should be tilted forward, so as to slide on its  corner, Fig. 214. In this way the depth of the gage line can be  regulated. Ordinarily, the finer the line the better. The head must  always be kept firmly pressed against the edge of the wood so that the  spur will not run or jump away from its desired course. Care should  also be taken, except in rough pieces, to run gage lines no farther  than is necessary for the sake of the appearance of the finished work.  To secure accuracy, all gaging on the surface of wood, should be done  from the \"working face\" or \"working edge.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 213. Setting a Marking-Gage.]    [Illustration: Fig. 214. Using the Marking-Gage.]    It is sometimes advisable, as in laying out chamfers, not to mark  their edges with a marking-gage, because the marks will show after the  chamfer is planed off. A pencil mark should be made instead. For  this purpose a pencil-gage may be made by removing the spur of a  marking-gage, and boring in its place a hole to receive a pencil stub  with a blunt point, or a small notch may be cut in the back end of  the beam, in which a pencil point is held while the gage is worked as  usual except that its position is reversed. For work requiring less  care, the pencil may be held in the manner usual in writing, the  middle finger serving as a guide, or a pair of pencil compasses may  be used, one leg serving as a guide. A special gage is made for gaging  curved lines, Fig. 215.    [Illustration: Fig. 215. Marking-Gage for Curves.]    The _cutting-gage_, Fig. 216, is similar to a marking-gage, except  that it has a knife-point inserted instead of a spur. It is very  useful in cutting up soft, thin wood even as thick as 1/4\".    [Illustration: Fig. 216. Cutting-Gage.]    The _slitting-gage_ is used in a similar way, but is larger and has a  handle.    The _mortise-gage_, Fig. 217, is a marking-gage with two spurs,  with which two parallel lines can be drawn at once, as in laying out  mortises. One form is made entirely of steel having, instead of spurs,  discs with sharpened edges.    The _scratch-awl_, Fig. 218, has a long, slender point which is useful  not only for marking lines, but for centering.    [Illustration: Fig. 217. Roller Mortise-Gage.]    The _auger-bit-gage_, Fig. 219, is a convenient tool for measuring the  depth of holes bored, but for ordinary purposes a block of wood sawn  to the proper length thru which a hole is bored, is a satisfactory  substitute.    _Screw- and wire-gages_, Fig. 220, are useful in measuring the lengths  and sizes of screws and wire when fitting or ordering.    The _spirit-level_, and the _plumb-line_ which it has largely  replaced, are"]]]
