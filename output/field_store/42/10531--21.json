Whatever could be done in the way of endowment or of  social preferment in behalf of the English church was done eagerly. But  happily this church had a better resource than royal governors in the  well-equipped and sustained, and generally well-chosen, army of  missionaries of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Not fewer  than fifty-eight of them were placed by the society in this single  province. And if among them there were those who seemed to \"preach  Christ of envy and strife,\" as if the great aim of the preacher of the  gospel were to get a man out of one Christian sect into another, there  were others who showed a more Pauline and more Christian conception of  their work, taking their full share of the task of bringing the  knowledge of Christ to the unevangelized, whether white, red, or  black.[80:2]    The diversity of organization which was destined to characterize the  church in the province of New York was increased by the inflow of  population from New England. The settlement of Long Island was from the  beginning Puritan English. The Hudson Valley began early to be occupied  by New Englanders bringing with them their pastors. In 1696 Domine  Selyns, the only Dutch pastor in New York City, in his annual report  congratulates himself, \"Our number is now full,\" meaning that there are  four Dutch ministers in the whole province of New York, and adds: \"In  the country places here there are many English preachers, mostly from  New England. They were ordained there, having been in a large measure  supplied by the University of Cambridge [Mass.].\" The same letter gives  the names of the three eminent French pastors ministering to the  communities of Huguenot refugees at New Rochelle and New York and  elsewhere in the neighborhood. The Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, more  important to the history of the opening century than any of the rest,  were yet to enter.    The spectacle of the ancient Dutch church thus dwindling, and seemingly  content to dwindle, to one of the least of the tribes, is not a cheerful  one, nor one easy to understand. But out of this little and dilapidated  Bethlehem was to come forth a leader. Domine Frelinghuysen, arriving in  America in 1720, was to begin a work of training for the ministry, which  would result, in 1784, in the establishment of the first American  professorship of theology;[81:1] and by the fervor of his preaching he  was to win the signal glory of bringing in the Great Awakening.

That the sectarian  proselyting zeal manifested in some of the missionaries' reports made an  unfavorable impression on the society is indicated by the peremptory  terms of a resolution adopted in 1710: \"That a stop be put to the  sending any more missionaries among Christians, except to such places  whose ministers are, or shall be, dead or removed\" (_ibid._, p. 69). A  good resolution, but not well kept.    [81:1] Corwin, p. 207. Undue stress should not be laid upon this formal  fact. The early New England colleges were primarily and mainly  theological seminaries and training-schools for the ministry. Their  professors were all theological professors. It is stated in Dwight's  \"Life of Edwards\" that James Pierpont, of New Haven, Edwards's  father-in-law, who died in 1714, lectured to the students of Yale  College, as professor of moral philosophy.          CHAPTER VIII.    THE PLANTING OF THE CHURCH IN NEW ENGLAND--PILGRIM AND PURITAN.      The attitude of the Church of England Puritans toward the Separatists  from that church was the attitude of the earnest, patient, hopeful  reformer toiling for the removal of public abuses, toward the restless  \"come-outer\" who quits the conflict in despair of succeeding, and,  \"without tarrying for any,\" sets up his little model of good order  outside. Such defection seemed to them not only of the nature of a  military desertion and a weakening of the right side, but also an  implied assertion of superior righteousness which provoked invidious  comparison and mutual irritation of feeling. The comparison must not be  pressed too far if we cite in illustration the feeling of the great mass  of earnest, practical antislavery men in the American conflict with  slavery toward the faction of \"come-outer\" abolitionists, who,  despairing of success within the church and the state, seceded from  both, thenceforth predicting failure for every practical enterprise of  reform on the part of their former workfellows, and at every defeat  chuckling, \"I told you so.\"    If we should compare the English Separatist of the seventeenth century  with this American Separatist of the nineteenth, we should be in still  greater danger of misleading. Certainly there were those among the  Separatists from the Church of England who, in the violence of their  alienation and the bitterness of their sufferings, did not refrain from  sour and acrid censoriousness toward the men who were nearest them in  religious conviction and pursuing like ends by another course. One does  not read far in the history of New England without encountering  reformers of this extreme type. But not such were the company of true  worshipers who, at peril of liberty and life, were wont to assemble each  Lord's day in a room of the old manor-house of Scrooby, of which William  Brewster was lessee, for Christian fellowship and worship, and for  instruction in Christian truth and duty from the saintly lips of John  Robinson. The extreme radicals of their day, they seem to have been  divinely preserved from the besetting sins of radicalism--its  narrowness, its self-righteousness, its censoriousness and intolerance.  Those who read the copious records of the early New England colonization  are again and again surprised at finding that the impoverished little  company of Separatists at Leyden and Plymouth, who were so sharply  reprobated by their Puritan brethren of the Church of England for their  schismatic attitude, their over-righteousness and exclusiveness, do  really excel, in liberality and patient tolerance and catholic and  comprehensive love toward all good men, those who sat in judgment on  them. Something of this is due to the native nobleness of the men  themselves, of whom the world was not worthy; something of it to their  long discipline in the passive virtues under bitter persecution in their  native land and in exile in Holland and in the wilderness; much of it  certainly to the incomparably wise and Christ-like teaching of Robinson  both at Scrooby and at Leyden, and afterward through the tender and  faithful epistles with which he followed them across the sea; and all of  it to the grace of God working in their hearts and glorified in their  living and their dying.    It would be incompatible with the limits of this volume to recite in  detail the story of the Pilgrims; it has been told more amply and with  fuller repetition than almost any other chapter of human history, and is  never to be told or heard without awakening that thrill with which the  heartstrings respond to the sufferings and triumphs of Christ's blessed  martyrs and confessors. But, more dispassionately studied with reference  to its position and relations in ecclesiastical history, it cannot be  understood unless the sharp and sometimes exasperated antagonism is kept  in view that existed between the inconsiderable faction, as it was  esteemed, of the Separatists, and the great and growing Puritan party at  that time in disfavor with king and court and hierarchy, but soon to  become the dominant party not only in the Church of England, but in the  nation. It is not strange that the antagonism between the two parties  should be lost sight of. The two are identified in their theological  convictions, in their spiritual sympathies, and, for the most part, in  their judgment on questions concerning the externals of the church; and  presently their respective colonies, planted side by side, not without  mutual doubts and suspicions, are to grow together, leaving no visible  seam of juncture,         Like kindred drops commingling into one.[84:1]    To the Puritan reformer within the Church of England, the act of the  Pilgrims at Scrooby in separating themselves from the general mass of  English Christians, mingled though that mass might be with a multitude  of unworthy was nothing less than the sin of schism. One"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20191"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Durham (#17)"],[1," and is the parish church of the ancient  borough of Elvet. The first church was erected by Bishop Carileph,  though the earliest parts of the existing building are of the time of  Bishop Pudsey, who also built the bridge across the river, known as the  Elvet Bridge. To this date (about 1190) belongs the eastern part of the  nave arcade, the arches of which are semi-circular and rest upon tall  round piers. Early in the fourteenth century a new chancel was built,  the aisles rebuilt and extended to the west end, and two new arches  added to the west end of the nave arcades. In the early part of the  fifteenth century a clerestory and open parapet were added, and a new  oak roof placed over the nave. This was most probably a hammer-beam  roof, and was coloured and gilded and decorated with angels holding  shields. The only parts remaining at the present day are the grotesque  carved corbels, and the angels. The tower was also constructed at this  time. In 1834, owing to subsidence of the ground, it became necessary to  rebuild the south aisle and a large part of the chancel, which caused  the destruction of much architectural beauty. The open parapet was  removed, the clerestory windows replaced by the present inferior ones,  and the fine oak roof destroyed. The east end of the chancel was rebuilt  in 1864. Special attention should be directed to the fine oak stall-work  in the chancel, boldly carved in the style of the early part of the  fifteenth century. The tower, which forms a beautiful and conspicuous  landmark, is reached by a stone staircase of unusual character. It is  placed in the thickness of the wall, and is covered in with twenty-four  gravestones of thirteenth and fourteenth century date, on which may yet  be seen portions of inscriptions and symbols. Built into the tower was  part of a Saxon cross, which has now been removed for preservation to  the dean and chapter library. This cross is interesting as evidence of  the existence on the same site of a pre-Norman church. The tower was  carefully restored in 1863. It contains a peal of six bells, which were  re-cast in 1694, and bear the following inscriptions:--        1. GLOVIA(?) IN ALTISSMISS(?)

Margaret's# Parish Church is situated on the steep hill called  Crossgate. It is opposite to and across the river from the Castle, and  from its churchyard a fine western view of the cathedral is obtained.  The church was built during the early part of the episcopate of Bishop  Pudsey (1154) and was formerly a chapel under the church of S. Oswald.  Here again alterations and restorations have obliterated much that  originally existed. The church at present consists of a nave and aisles,  a chancel with aisles, a western tower, and north and south porches. The  existing portions of the original church are the chancel arch, and the  south arcade of four bays, together with part of the clerestory and the  north wall of the chancel. The arcade consists of low massive circular  piers, with cushion capitals and plain chamfered abaci, which support  semi-circular arches of one order also chamfered.    The north arcade is also Norman, and very similar in character to that  of S. Oswald. No doubt it is of the same date, and probably built by the  same architect. The chancel arch has two orders, recessed square and  chamfered, with a plain chamfered hood mould. On both north and south  sides of the arch is a squint. With the exception of two which are  Norman, the windows are nearly all of modern date. One is in the north  wall of the chancel and is widely splayed. It is not seen on the outside  owing to the vestry which now covers it. The other, a very interesting  specimen, is situated over the western bay of the south arcade, and is a  portion of the original clerestory and the earliest known clerestory  window in the county. The roof of the nave is of oak, and a good  specimen of Perpendicular work. The tower is of fifteenth-century date,  and exceedingly plain externally, but vaulted in the interior. It opens  on to the church by an arch which has been inserted in the west wall.  There is an interesting font of Frosterley marble, which is apparently  of the same date as the chancel. The vestry which is raised above the  level of the church floor is of the fifteenth century, and has on its  gable the original gable cross.    [Illustration: The Cathedral and Castle, from the North.]    The Parish Church of #S. Giles# occupies a very elevated position at  the north-east end of the city, and commands one of the finest views of  the cathedral, castle, and city, which it is possible to obtain. It was  built by Bishop Flambard and finished as early as 1112; but the north  wall of the nave, containing two small Norman windows, widely splayed  inwards, and a walled-up doorway is all that remains of this early  church. The chancel is of later Norman of the time of Pudsey. Both  within and without a bold chamfered string course runs round the  chancel. On the south side is a semi-circular headed window, with a  carved dripstone and nook shafts, the capitals of which bear a similar  character to those in the Galilee Chapel of the cathedral. In the north  wall of the chancel is the priests' door, now walled up, and the corbels  and springers of the original chancel arch built by Pudsey. The present  arch was erected in 1876. In 1414 considerable alterations were made  during the episcopate of Bishop Langley, when the walls of the nave were  raised, the upper stage of the tower built, and the west window  inserted. The font is a fine stone bowl resting on a shaft, and is  undoubtedly of the time of Flambard. The chancel contains some monuments  of the Tempest and Heath families, who were the ancestors of the  Marchioness of Londonderry, patroness of the church and parish of S.  Giles. The tower contains three bells, the first and second of which are  pre-Reformation and the third bears the date 1646.    On the north side of Gilesgate near to the North-Eastern goods station,  are the ruins of the little #Chapel of S. Mary Magdalen#, of which  only a small portion remains. At the west end of the north and south  walls are two doorways, the latter walled up. Portions of the east  window are still in position, but it would appear to have been of  earlier date than the surrounding walls, and probably had been brought  from some other building. In the interior are the remains of a  Frosterley marble font, and a gable cross of thirteenth-century date is  in the custody of the dean and chapter. The chapel was 43 feet by 161/2  feet wide. It is supposed to have been founded by Sir John Fitz  Alexander. In 1370 it was almost entirely rebuilt, and again in 1449, on  a site near the original one. The reason for this was the moisture of  the ground, which caused the foundations to become insecure. The  government was in the hands of the almoner of the cathedral, who  distributed doles to the poor. The chapel was used as a place of worship  until nearly the end of the seventeenth century, when, owing to its  ruinous condition, services were finally discontinued.           *       *       *       *       *        [Illustration: PLAN AND DIMENSIONS.]    PRINCIPAL DIMENSIONS OF THE CATHEDRAL                                           Feet.
