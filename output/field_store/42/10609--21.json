Colonel Smith  fixes their earliest origin to the westward of the Asiatic mountains,  where the Bactrian and Persian plains commence, and the Scythian steppes  stretch to the north. Thence they have been spread over Europe, Asia,  and part of Africa, many have again become wild, and others are the  pampered dependents of amateur sportsmen. Many Russian noblemen keep  packs of them in the Steppes.    The Scotch greyhound (Cania Scoticus), generally white, with black  clouds, is said to be the most intellectual of all, and formerly to have  had so good a scent, as to be employed as a blood-hound. Maida, whose  name is immortalized as the favourite of Sir Walter Scott, was a  Scottish greyhound.    The Irish is the largest of all the western breeds, and is supposed to  owe this distinction to mingling with the great Danish dog. To it  Ireland owes the extirpation of wolves, and itself now scarcely exists  but in name.    An instance is recorded of a black greyhound, in Lancashire, who adopted  a life of freedom, and lived upon depredation. Many attempts were made  to shoot her, but she eluded them all; she was at last ensnared in a  barn, where she had placed her puppies; they were destroyed, and she  partially reclaimed, so as to be useful in coursing; but she always  retained that wild look which told of her frolic. A Mr. Kirkpatrick  possessed a greyhound which always took care of the meat in the kitchen,  and defended it from cats and other dogs.    The rough, large-boned, ill-looking Lurcher, is said to have descended  from the rough greyhound and the shepherd's dog. It is now rare, but  there are some of its sinister-looking mongrel progeny still to be seen.  They always bear the reputation of being poachers' dogs, and are deeply  attached to their owners. They have a fine scent; and a man confessed to  Mr. Bewick, that he could, with his pair of lurchers, procure as many  rabbits as he pleased. They never give tongue, but set about their work  silently and cautiously, and hunt hares and partridges, driving the  latter into the nets of the unlawful sportsmen. They will even pull down  deer.    There are still many English hearts which beat quicker at the cry of the  hound; there are some old ones which throb at the recollection of the  well-appointed field, when the bugle summoned them to the chase, when  gallant steeds carried them over gate, hedge, ditch, and river; they  even glory when they refer to fearful tumbles, barely escaping with  life, and some meeting with a death next in honour, according to their  notions, to that of a soldier in action. There are some young ones who  listen with entranced ears to the deeds of their forefathers, and amidst  the toil of the dark counting-house, wish that such times could come for  them. They never will come again; railroads have been invented, men's  minds have been diverted into other channels; and fox-hunting, with its  concomitant evils and its attendant pleasures, is gradually disappearing  from fox-hunting England. Some, on whom the spirit of Nimrod has  descended with such force, as to render them impatient under the  privation, go to distant lands, and there perform feats worthy of the  mighty hunter; but it is neither with hawk nor hound, and before many  generations have passed, our beautiful race of hunting dogs will exist  but in name.    There are more varieties of these hounds than I can here enumerate; but  all possess a larger development of brain than the greyhound; their nose  is broader, as well as their jaws; their ears are large and hanging;  their tail is raised and truncated, and they have a firm, bold, and  erect gait, an appearance of strength, independence, and (if I may be  allowed to use the expression) candour, which is vainly looked for in  other dogs. They came to us from the East, probably at a later period  than those dogs which more resemble the wolf.    The once-esteemed Blood-hound is now rare, and I copy Mr. Bell's  description of the breed, in possession of his namesake:--\"They stand  twenty-eight inches high at the shoulder; the muzzle broad and full, the  upper lip large and pendulous, the vertex of the head protuberant, the  expression stern, thoughtful, and noble; the breast broad; the limbs  strong and muscular, and the original colour a deep tan, with large  black clouds. They are silent when following their scent; and in this  respect differ from other hounds, who are generally gifted with fine,  deep voices. Numbers, under the name of sleuth-hounds, used to be kept  on the Borders, and kings and troopers, perhaps equally marauders, have,  in olden times, found it difficult to evade them. The noble Bruce had  several narrow escapes from them, and the only sure way to destroy their  scent was to spill blood upon the track. In all the common routine of  life they are good-natured and intelligent, and make excellent  watch-dogs. A story is related of a nobleman, who, to make trial whether  a young hound was well instructed, desired one of his servants to walk  to a town four miles off, and then to a market-town, three miles from  thence. The dog, without seeing the man he was to pursue, followed him  by the scent to the above mentioned places, notwithstanding the  multitude of market people that went along the same road, and of  travellers that had occasion to come; and when the blood-hound came to  the cross market-town, he passed through the streets without taking  notice of any of the people there, and ceased not till he had gone to  the house where the man he sought rested himself, and where he found him  in an upper room, to the wonder of those who had accompanied him in this  pursuit.\"[4]    The stately Stag-hound, with his steady, cautious qualities, is little  less valuable than the blood-hound for following a scent. Marvellous  feats are related of his perseverance and strength in pursuit of his  game; but since the reign of George the Third, the breed has not been  kept up. That monarch was particularly fond of this description of  hunting; but now, having fallen into disuse, it is not likely to be  revived. Stag-hounds are somewhat smaller than the blood-hound; rougher,  with a wider nose, shorter head, loose hanging ears, and a rush tail,  nearly erect. A most remarkable stag hunt is recorded as having taken  place in Westmoreland, which extended into Scotland. All the dogs were  thrown out except two, who followed their quarry the whole way. The stag  returned to the park whence it started, where it leapt over the wall  and expired, having made a circuit of at least 120 miles. The hounds  were found dead at a little distance, having been unable to leap the  wall.    The fox-hounds are still smaller than the stag-hounds, are generally  white in colour, with clouds of black and tan. They have been known to  run at full speed for ten hours, during which the hunters were obliged  to change their horses three times, or abandon the pursuit.    The Harrier and the Beagle are still smaller varieties: as the name  indicates, the former are used exclusively for hunting the hare, and  have nearly superseded the beagle, which is chiefly valuable for its  very musical note. There was a fancy breed of them in the time of Queen  Elizabeth, so small, that they could be carried in a man's glove, and  were called singing dogs. They used to be conveyed to the field in  paniers.    Turnspits are descended from ill-made hounds, which they resemble in  body, but have very short, and even crooked legs. They are rough or  smooth. They are said also to be derived from terriers, and it seems to  me that the perpetuation of malformation in several breeds will produce  the turnspit. They derive their name from having been used to turn the  kitchen spit, being put into an enclosed wheel, placed at the end for  the purpose. It is a curious fact, that now the office is abolished, the  race has become nearly extinct. I extract the following from Captain  Brown's \"Popular Natural History,\" to prove, that if turnspits had  crooked legs, they had not crooked wits:--\"I have had in my kitchen,\"  said the Duke de Liancourt, to M. Descartes, \"two turnspits, which took  their turns regularly every other day in the wheel; one of them, not  liking his employment, hid himself on the day he should have wrought,  when his companion was forced to mount the wheel in his stead; but  crying and wagging his tail, he intimated that those in attendance  should first follow him. He immediately conducted them to a garret,  where he dislodged the idle dog, and killed him immediately.\" The  following occurrence at the Jesuit's College at Fleche, shows that  others of the species have kept the turnspit to this disagreeable duty.  When the cook had prepared the meat for roasting, he found that the dog  which should have wrought the spit had disappeared. He attempted to  employ another, but it bit his leg and fled. Soon after, however, the  refractory dog entered the kitchen, driving before him the truant  turnspit, which immediately, of its own accord, went into the wheel. A  company of turnspits were assembled in the Abbey Church of Bath, where  they remained very quietly. At one part of the service, however, the  word \"spit\" was pronounced, rather loudly. This reminded the dogs of  their duty, and they all rushed out in a body, to go to their respective  dwellings.    From the word \"Spanish\" being often prefixed to the name of the Pointer,  it is supposed that these dogs came to us from the Peninsula; but as all  dogs came from the East, their more ancient origin is to be ascribed to  the Phoenicians, who brought them, not only to that country, but probably  to England, although many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],[0,"The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#17)"],[1,"M'Bride of the 18th Hussars. Lad's father and  mother dead. M'Bride stands in place of guardian.\"    \"A likely story,\" the adjutant muttered to himself. \"What is your name,  lad?\"    \"I enlist as Edward Smith,\" Edgar said, \"age sixteen.\"    \"Parents dead?\"    \"I lost them when I was a child, sir.\"    \"Who were they?\"    \"My father was a sergeant in the 30th Foot, sir.\"    The adjutant was watching him narrowly.    \"Either he is telling the truth,\" he said to himself, \"or he is one of  the calmest young liars I have ever come across.\"    \"And there is no one who has any legal right to control you or to object  to your enlisting?\"    \"No one, sir.\"    \"You cannot play, I suppose?\"    \"I have been learning the trumpet for some little time, sir, and can  sound a few of the calls.\"    \"Well, I suppose that will do, sergeant. You had better take him across  to the doctor. If he passes him put him up for the night, and bring him  here to-morrow at twelve o'clock to be sworn in.\"    \"Rather a tough case that,\" he said to himself as the trumpet-major left  with the young recruit. \"There is not a doubt the boy is lying, and yet  I could have declared he was speaking the truth. Of course he may be the  son of a non-commissioned officer, and have been brought up and educated  by someone. He looks a gentleman all over, and speaks like one. Well, it  is no business of mine;\" and the adjutant gave the matter no further  thought.    The next day Edgar was sworn in. The colonel, hearing from the adjutant  that he had questioned the boy, and that there was no impediment to his  enlisting, passed him without a remark, and Edgar was at once taken to  the regimental tailor and measured for his uniform, and half an hour  later was marched out with four or five of the other trumpeters beyond  the confines of the camp, and was there set to work at the calls. His  work was by no means light. He was at once sent into the riding-school,  and he found it a very different thing to satisfy the riding-master and  his sergeants than it had been to learn to sit a horse at home. However,  his previous practice in that way rendered the work much easier for him  than it would otherwise have been, and he was not very long in passing  out from the squad of recruits. Then he had two or three hours a day of  practice with the trumpet, an hour a day at gymnastics, and in the  afternoon two hours of school. The last item was, however, but child's  play, and as soon as the instructor saw that the lad could without  difficulty take a first-class, he employed him in aiding to teach  others.    The evening was the only time he had to himself; then, if he chose to  take the trouble to dress, he could go out into the town or stroll  through the camp or take a walk. If disinclined for this there was the  cavalry canteen, with a large concert-room attached, where  entertainments were given by music-hall singers brought down from  London. The trumpeters and bandsmen had a barrack-room to themselves.  Edgar, who had a healthy appetite, found the food of a very different  description to that to which he had been accustomed. Although up at six  o'clock in the morning, even in the winter, as it was, there was nothing  to eat until eight. Then there was a mug of a weak fluid called tea, and  an allowance of bread. The dinner, which was at one, consisted of an  amount of meat scarcely sufficient for a growing boy; for although had  the allowance consisted entirely of flesh, it would have been ample, it  was so largely reduced by the amount of bone and fat that the meat was  reduced to a minimum. However, when eked out with potatoes and bread it  sufficed well enough.    Tea at six consisted, like breakfast, of a mug of tea and bread. Edgar  found, however, that the Spartan breakfasts and teas could be  supplemented by additions purchased at the canteen. Here pennyworths of  butter, cheese, bacon, an egg, a herring, and many similar luxuries were  obtainable, and two pence of his pay was invariably spent on breakfast,  a penny sufficing for the addition to his tea.    He found that he soon got on well with his comrades. It was like going  to a fresh school. There was at first a good deal of rough chaff, but as  soon as it was found that he could take this good-temperedly, and that  if pushed beyond a fair limit he was not only ready to fight but was  able to use his fists with much more science than any of the other  trumpeters, he was soon left alone, and indeed became a favourite with  the bandsmen. Two months after he joined he was appointed to a troop. He  found, however, that he did not have to accompany them generally on  parade. The regiment, like all others at home, was very short of its  complement of horses, and only one trumpeter to each squadron was  mounted. Edgar, however, cared little for this. He considered his first  two years' work as merely a probation which had to be gone through  before he could take his place in the ranks as a trooper.    He found his pay sufficient for his needs. Although he had in the old  days been in the habit of drinking beer, he had made a resolution to  abstain from it altogether on joining the regiment. He determined to  gain his stripes at the earliest possible opportunity, and knew well  enough, from what he had heard Captain Clinton say, that drink was the  curse of the army, and that men, although naturally sober and steady,  were sometimes led into it, and thereby lost all chance of ever rising.  He had never smoked, and it was no privation to him to abstain from  tobacco, and he had therefore the whole of his pay, after the usual  deduction for stoppages, at his disposal for food, and had always a  little in his pocket to lend to any comrade who had the bad luck to be  put on heavy stoppages by the loss of some of his necessaries.    In this respect he himself suffered somewhat heavily at first.  Accustomed at school to leave his things carelessly about without the  slightest doubt as to their safety, he was astonished and shocked to  find that a very much laxer code of morality prevailed in the army, and  that any necessaries left about instantly disappeared. The first week  after joining he lost nearly half the articles that had been served out  to him, and was for some months on heavy stoppages of pay to replace  them. The lesson, however, had its effect, and he quickly learnt to keep  a sharp look-out over his things. He was soon dismissed from school,  obtaining his first-class at the examination, which took place two  months after he joined, and this gave him time to attend the  fencing-school, and to give more time to gymnastics.    When once accustomed to his work he found his life an easy and pleasant  one, and had far more time at his disposal than had been the case at  school. He resolutely avoided dwelling on the past, and whenever he  found himself thinking of what had so long been home, he took up a book,  or went out for a walk, or engaged in some occupation that served to  distract his thoughts. He missed the games. Football was occasionally  played, but there was no observance of rules, and after trying it once  or twice he gave it up in disgust. He often joined in a game at fives,  and practised running and jumping, so as to be able to take part in the  regimental sports in the spring.    When Easter had passed and the weather became bright and pleasant he  often took long walks alone, for it was seldom he could find anyone  willing to accompany him. He had learnt drawing at Cheltenham, and as he  found that it would be useful for him when he obtained the rank of a  non-commissioned officer to make sketches and maps to send in with  reports of any country reconnoitred, he accustomed himself to do this on  his walks, jotting down the features of the country, noticing the spots  where roads came in, the width of the bridges across the canals and the  nature of their banks, and taking sketches of what appeared to him  positions that would be occupied to check a pursuing force, or to be  taken up by an advanced one.    At this time, too, he joined a class for signalling, and found it highly  interesting, and before the end of the summer could send a message or  read one with flags or flash-lights. As soon as the summer really began  he took to cricket, and here he speedily attracted the attention of the  officers. He had been the best bowler in the second eleven, and would  have been in the first the next season at Cheltenham. But it was some  little time before his proficiency as a bowler became known, although  it was soon seen that his batting was far above the average.    \"That youngster handles his bat well, Moffat,\" one of the lieutenants  said to the captain, who was the most energetic cricketer among the  officers, and who with one or two of the sergeants generally made up the  team when the regimental eleven played against that of another corps.    \"Yes, he plays in good form, doesn't he? Who is the young fellow at the  wicket now, sergeant?\"    \"He is trumpeter of D troop, sir. He only joined three months ago, but  he could play a bit when he came, and got posted to a troop before two  others who joined four or five months before him.\"    \"The man who is bowling now is not up to much, sergeant. Suppose you  take the ball for an over or two; I should like to see how that young  fellow would stand up to your bowling.\"    The sergeant, who was one of the regimental bowlers, took the ball.  Edgar, who had been driving the previous bowler in all directions, at  once played carefully, and for an over or two contented himself with  blocking the balls, then one came a little wide and he cut it to leg for  four.    Captain Moffat took off his coat and waistcoat and took the end facing  the sergeant, and began to bowl some slow twisting balls, that were in  strong contrast to the fast delivery of the sergeant. Edgar felt now  that he was being tried, and played very cautiously. There were"]]]
