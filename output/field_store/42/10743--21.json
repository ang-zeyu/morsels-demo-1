The Kid gave a sudden howl.  Psmith's hat, suddenly imbued with life, sprang into the air and  vanished, whirling into the night.    The thought did not come to them consciously at the moment, there  being little time to think, but it was evident as soon as, diving  out of the circle of light into the sheltering darkness, they  crouched down and waited for the next move, that a somewhat skilful  ambush had been effected. The other members of the gang, who had  fled with such remarkable speed, had by no means been eliminated  altogether from the game. While the questioning of Mr. Repetto had  been in progress, they had crept back, unperceived except by Mr.  Repetto himself. It being too dark for successful shooting, it had  become Mr. Repetto's task to lure his captors into the light, which  he had accomplished with considerable skill.    For some minutes the battle halted. There was dead silence. The  circle of light was empty now. Mr. Repetto had vanished. A  tentative shot from nowhere ripped through the air close to where  Psmith lay flattened on the pavement. And then the pavement began  to vibrate and give out a curious resonant sound. To Psmith it  conveyed nothing, but to the opposing army it meant much. They knew  it for what it was. Somewhere--it might be near or far--a policeman  had heard the shots, and was signalling for help to other policemen  along the line by beating on the flag-stones with his night-stick,  the New York constable's substitute for the London police-whistle.    The noise grew, filling the still air. From somewhere down the road  sounded the ring of running feet.    \"De cops!\" cried a voice. \"Beat it!\"    Next moment the night was full of clatter. The gang was \"beating  it.\"    Psmith rose to his feet and dusted his clothes ruefully. For the  first time he realised the horrors of war. His hat had gone for  ever. His trousers could never be the same again after their close  acquaintance with the pavement.    The rescue party was coming up at the gallop.    The New York policeman may lack the quiet dignity of his London  rival, but he is a hustler.    \"What's doing?\"    \"Nothing now,\" said the disgusted voice of Billy Windsor from the  shadows. \"They've beaten it.\"    The circle of lamplight became as if by mutual consent a general  rendezvous. Three grey-clad policemen, tough, clean-shaven men with  keen eyes and square jaws, stood there, revolver in one hand,  night-stick in the other. Psmith, hatless and dusty, joined them.  Billy Windsor and the Kid, the latter bleeding freely from his left  ear, the lobe of which had been chipped by a bullet, were the last  to arrive.    \"What's bin the rough house?\" inquired one of the policemen, mildly  interested.    \"Do you know a sportsman of the name of Repetto?\" inquired Psmith.    \"Jack Repetto! Sure.\"    \"He belongs to the Three Points,\" said another intelligent officer,  as one naming some fashionable club.    \"When next you see him,\" said Psmith, \"I should be obliged if you  would use your authority to make him buy me a new hat. I could do  with another pair of trousers, too; but I will not press the  trousers. A new hat, is, however, essential. Mine has a six-inch  hole in it.\"    \"Shot at you, did they?\" said one of the policemen, as who should  say, \"Dash the lads, they're always up to some of their larks.\"    \"Shot at us!\" burst out the ruffled Kid. \"What do you think's bin  happening? Think an aeroplane ran into my ear and took half of it  off? Think the noise was somebody opening bottles of pop? Think  those guys that sneaked off down the road was just training for a  Marathon?\"    \"Comrade Brady,\" said Psmith, \"touches the spot. He--\"    \"Say, are you Kid Brady?\" inquired one of the officers. For the  first time the constabulary had begun to display any real  animation.    \"Reckoned I'd seen you somewhere!\" said another. \"You licked  Cyclone Al. all right, Kid, I hear.\"    \"And who but a bone-head thought he wouldn't?\" demanded the third  warmly. \"He could whip a dozen Cyclone Al.'s in the same evening  with his eyes shut.\"    \"He's the next champeen,\" admitted the first speaker.    \"If he puts it over Jimmy Garvin,\" argued the second.    \"Jimmy Garvin!\" cried the third. \"He can whip twenty Jimmy Garvins  with his feet tied. I tell you--\"    \"I am loath,\" observed Psmith, \"to interrupt this very impressive  brain-barbecue, but, trivial as it may seem to you, to me there is  a certain interest in this other little matter of my ruined hat. I  know that it may strike you as hypersensitive of us to protest  against being riddled with bullets, but--\"    \"Well, what's bin doin'?\" inquired the Force. It was a nuisance,  this perpetual harping on trifles when the deep question of the  light-weight Championship of the World was under discussion, but  the sooner it was attended to, the sooner it would be over.    Billy Windsor undertook to explain.    \"The Three Points laid for us,\" he said. \"Jack Repetto was bossing  the crowd. I don't know who the rest were. The Kid put one over on  to Jack Repetto's chin, and we were asking him a few questions when  the rest came back, and started into shooting. Then we got to cover  quick, and you came up and they beat it.\"    \"That,\" said Psmith, nodding, \"is a very fair _precis_ of the  evening's events. We should like you, if you will be so good, to  corral this Comrade Repetto, and see that he buys me a new hat.\"    \"We'll round Jack up,\" said one of the policemen indulgently.    \"Do it nicely,\" urged Psmith. \"Don't go hurting his feelings.\"    The second policeman gave it as his opinion that Jack was getting  too gay. The third policeman conceded this. Jack, he said, had  shown signs for some time past of asking for it in the neck. It was  an error on Jack's part, he gave his hearers to understand, to  assume that the lid was completely off the great city of New York.    \"Too blamed fresh he's gettin',\" the trio agreed. They could not  have been more disapproving if they had been prefects at Haileybury  and Mr. Repetto a first-termer who had been detected in the act of  wearing his cap on the back of his head.    They seemed to think it was too bad of Jack.    \"The wrath of the Law,\" said Psmith, \"is very terrible. We will  leave the matter, then, in your hands. In the meantime, we should  be glad if you would direct us to the nearest Subway station. Just  at the moment, the cheerful lights of the Great White Way are what  I seem to chiefly need.\"        CHAPTER XVII    GUERILLA WARFARE    Thus ended the opening engagement of the campaign, seemingly in a  victory for the _Cosy Moments_ army. Billy Windsor, however, shook  his head.    \"We've got mighty little out of it,\" he said.    \"The victory,\" said Psmith, \"was not bloodless. Comrade Brady's ear,  my hat--these are not slight casualties. On the other hand, surely  we are one up? Surely we have gained ground? The elimination of  Comrade Repetto from the scheme of things in itself is something. I  know few men I would not rather meet in a lonely road than Comrade  Repetto. He is one of Nature's sand-baggers. Probably the thing  crept upon him slowly. He started, possibly, in a merely tentative  way by slugging one of the family circle. His nurse, let us say, or  his young brother. But, once started, he is unable to resist the  craving. The thing grips him like dram-drinking. He sandbags now not  because he really wants to, but because he cannot help himself. To  me there is something consoling in the thought that Comrade Repetto  will no longer be among those present.\"    \"What makes you think that?\"    \"I should imagine that a benevolent Law will put him away in his  little cell for at least a brief spell.\"    \"Not on your life,\" said Billy. \"He'll prove an alibi.\"    Psmith's eyeglass dropped out of his eye. He replaced it, and  gazed, astonished, at Billy.    \"An alibi? When three keen-eyed men actually caught him at it?\"    \"He can find thirty toughs to swear he was five miles away.\"    \"And get the court to believe it?\" said Psmith.    \"Sure,\" said Billy disgustedly. \"You don't catch them hurting a  gangsman unless they're pushed against the wall. The politicians  don't want the gangs in gaol, especially as the Aldermanic  elections will be on in a few weeks. Did you ever hear of Monk  Eastman?\"    \"I fancy not, Comrade Windsor. If I did, the name has escaped me.  Who was this cleric?\"    \"He was the first boss of the East Side gang, before Kid Twist took  it on.\"    \"Yes?\"    \"He was arrested dozens of times, but he always got off. Do you  know what he said once, when they pulled him for thugging a fellow  out in New Jersey?\"    \"I fear not, Comrade Windsor. Tell me all.\"    \"He said, 'You're arresting me, huh? Say, you want to look where  you're goin'; I cut some ice in this town. I made half the big  politicians in New York!' That was what he said.\"    \"His small-talk,\" said Psmith, \"seems to have been bright and  well-expressed. What happened then? Was he restored to his friends  and his relations?\"    \"Sure, he was. What do you think? Well, Jack Repetto isn't Monk  Eastman, but he's in with Spider Reilly, and the Spider's in with  the men behind. Jack'll get off.\"    \"It looks to me, Comrade Windsor,\" said Psmith thoughtfully, \"as if  my stay in this great city were going to cost me a small fortune in  hats.\"    Billy's prophecy proved absolutely correct. The police were as good  as their word. In due season they rounded up the impulsive Mr.  Repetto, and he was haled before a magistrate. And then, what a  beautiful exhibition of brotherly love and auld-lang-syne  camaraderie was witnessed! One by one, smirking sheepishly, but  giving out their evidence with unshaken earnestness, eleven greasy,  wandering-eyed youths mounted the witness-stand and affirmed on  oath that at the time mentioned dear old Jack had been making "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26076"],[0,"Birds from Coahuila, Mexico (#17)"],[1,"Warbler is an uncommon visitant or migrant in  Coahuila. Miller (1955a:172) remarked that Marsh took a fall migrant on  September 1 in Chuperosa Canyon in the Sierra del Carmen. Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:202) secured a female Black and White Warbler \"in an  orchard on the outskirts of Saltillo\" on April 20 and a male \"near the  top of Diamante Pass on April 23.\"    _Vermivora celata celata_ (Say).--_Specimens examined:_ total 2: sex ?  31091 from the Rio Grande (=17 mi. S Dryden, Terrell Co., Texas, in  Coahuila), 600 ft., March 19, 1952, measurements: wing, 57 mm.; tail,  47 mm.; weight, 7.7 gms.; and [Male] 31092 from 4 mi. W Hacienda La  Mariposa, 2300 ft., March 25, 1952, measurements: wing, 62 mm.; tail,  48 mm.; weight, 9.2 gms.    This subspecies of the Orange-crowned Warbler is an uncommon migrant in  Coahuila. In Brewster County, Texas, Van Tyne and Sutton (1937:83)  found _V. c. celata_ \"not common as a spring transient.\" Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:239) recorded _V. c. celata_ from  Coahuila. The quality of the pale yellow color and the sizes of Nos.  31091-31092 suggest that they are representatives of _V. c. celata_.    _Vermivora celata orestera_ Oberholser.--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:202)  found _V. c. orestera_ \"only on infrequent occasions ... in the open  woods surrounding the summit of Diamante Pass\" where they obtained one  specimen.    _Vermivora virginiae_ (Baird).--Miller (1955a:172) took a male  Virginia's Warbler in Boquillas Canyon in the Sierra del Carmen \"in  scattered scrubby oak growth with grass and cactus beneath.\" This  species in the Sierra del Carmen is considered \"casual\" by Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:241).    **_Vermivora crissalis_ (Salvin and Godman).--_Specimen examined:_ one,  [Male] 31590, from 20 mi. S Ocampo, 7000 ft., April 5, 1954, weight, 10  gms.    The Colima Warbler is common locally in Coahuila. Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:203) found this species fairly common on the steep, rugged slopes  above the summit of Diamante Pass and saw none below an elevation of  approximately 7500 feet. Bangs (1925:251) stated that Nelson and  Goldman secured a specimen of the Colima Warbler at Sierra Guadalupe on  April 25.    *_Vermivora superciliosa mexicana_ (Bonaparte).--_Specimen examined:_  one, [Male] 31591, from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9350 ft.,  April 10, 1954.    Hartlaub's Warbler is uncommon in Coahuila and seems to occur only in  the southeastern section of the State; No. 31591 is the first record of  the species in Coahuila. The size of the testes (5x2 mm.) of No. 31591  and the fact that the bird was singing when first seen suggest the  possibility that _V. s. mexicana_ breeds in southeastern Coahuila.  Breeding there is not unexpected because the species has been found  breeding in Nuevo Leon (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore,  1957:242).    _Parula americana_ (Linnaeus).--Miller (1955a:172) obtained a migrant  Parula Warbler in an oak grove at 7000 feet on April 16 in the Sierra  del Carmen, and remarked that it was \"apparently the first record of  this species in Coahuila.\"    *_Parula pitiayumi nigrilora_ Coues.--The AOU Check-list Committee  (1957:486) recorded this subspecies of the Olive-backed Warbler as a  resident at Sabinas.    *_Peucedramus taeniatus arizonae_ Miller and Griscom.--This subspecies  of the Olive Warbler is locally common in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:172)  found _P. t. arizonae_ common in the pine timber above 6800 feet in the  Sierra del Carmen and suggested that this warbler breeds in these  mountains. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:203) found the Olive Warbler in a  thick pine wood at an elevation of 9500 to 10,000 feet and remarked  that this species was \"decidedly uncommon in the Diamante Pass area.\"  They (_loc. cit._) obtained a female (not identified to subspecies) on  April 23 that had a \"well developed brood patch and was unquestionably  incubating eggs.\" Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:40) took a single female  at Diamante Pass on March 6 which also was not identified to  subspecies. Dickerman saw Olive Warblers in the Sierra de la Madera on  December 13, 1953, and 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas on April  10, 1954.    _Dendroica petechia morcomi_ Coale.--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:246) reported this subspecies of the Yellow Warbler as  having been recorded from Coahuila.    _Dendroica auduboni auduboni_ (Townsend).--_Specimens examined:_ total  2: [Male] 31094 (skeleton only) from Fortin (=33 mi. N, 1 mi. E San  Geronimo), 3300 ft., March 29, 1952; and [Male] 31093 from 4 mi. W  Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft., March 25, 1952, weight, 12.3 gms.    Audubon's Warbler is a common winter visitant and migrant in Coahuila.  Miller (1955a:173) recorded _D. a. auduboni_ as a migrant from April 7  to 26 in the Sierra del Carmen; he found no suggestion of breeding by  the Audubon's Warbler in the northwestern section of the State. One  individual that Miller (_loc. cit._) obtained was extensively black and  approached the characters of the subspecies _nigrifrons_ of Chihuahua.  He (_loc. cit._) suggested that the black individual was taken from  \"part of a cline of blackness and size in which _D. a. auduboni_ of the  northwest and _D. a. nigrifrons_ of Mexico are extremes.\" Burleigh and  Lowery (1942:203) remarked that Audubon's Warbler \"is doubtless a  common winter bird in the area around Saltillo.\" Two specimens obtained  by Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._) \"might be considered intermediate\"  between _auduboni_ and _memorabilis_. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:40)  saw Audubon's Warbler \"in some numbers near San Pedro ... [on] January  29 and 30.\" Dickerman saw Audubon's Warblers 13 mi. E San Antonio de  las Alazanas on April 10, 1954. Miller (1955a:173) also obtained, in  the Sierra del Carmen, a hybrid between _D. coronata_ and _D.  auduboni_.    _Dendroica auduboni memorabilis_ Oberholser.--Oberholser (1921:246)  recorded _D. a. memorabilis_ from Saltillo on April 17. This subspecies  seems to winter commonly in western Mexico and less commonly in the  Central Plateau and Sierra Madre Oriental (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore, 1957:249-250).    _Dendroica nigrescens_ (Townsend).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male]  31095, from Fortin (=33 mi. N, 8 mi. W San Geronimo), 3300 ft., March  28, 1952, weight, 9.3 gms.    The Black-throated Gray Warbler is an uncommon spring and possibly fall  migrant in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:173) found _D. nigrescens_ uncommon  in the Sierra del Carmen. He saw and heard a spring migrant singing on  April 12 at 7000 feet and obtained a male on April 16.    _Dendroica townsendi_ (Townsend).--Townsend's Warbler is a spring and  fall migrant in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:173) recorded _D. townsendi_ on  September 2 at Jardin del Sur in Chuperosa Canyon in the Sierra del  Carmen. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:203) saw two individuals of  Townsend's Warbler at Diamante Pass on April 14. Amadon and Phillips  (1947:578) secured this species \"in mesquite about twenty miles west of  Saltillo on August 28.\" Dickerman saw Townsend's Warblers in the Sierra  de la Madera on December 13, 1953; 20 mi. S Ocampo on April 4, 1954;  and 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas on April 10, 1954.    _Dendroica virens_ (Gmelin).--Dickerman saw one Black-throated Green  Warbler 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9350 feet, on April 10,  1954, in a white pine-Douglas fir-aspen association. This seems to be  the first record of this species in Coahuila.    *_Dendroica chrysoparia_ Sclater and Salvin.--Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:251) listed the Golden-cheeked Warbler from  Hipolito on July 3.    _Dendroica occidentalis_ (Townsend).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male]  31592, from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, April 10, 1954.    The Hermit Warbler seems to be an uncommon spring and probably fall  migrant in Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:252)  reported _D. occidentalis_ from the State. No. 31592, whose testes were  not enlarged, was obtained in a pine-spruce-aspen association.    _Geothlypis trichas brachidactylus_ (Swainson).--Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:261) listed this subspecies of the  Yellowthroat as recorded from Coahuila.    _Geothlypis trichas occidentalis_ Brewster.--Burleigh and Lowery  (1942:204) found the Yellowthroat \"only on the outskirts of Saltillo,  where ... [this species] was not uncommon in the thickets, especially  around a small stand of marsh grass bordering a pond.\" Three males that  Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._) obtained were tentatively identified  as _G. t. occidentalis_. Dickerman saw one male Yellowthroat at San  Marcos (=20 mi. S Cuatro Cienegas) on May 4, 1954.    _Geothlypis nelsoni nelsoni_ Richmond.--Burleigh and Lowery (1942:204)  noted the Hooded Yellowthroat \"only on the open slopes above the summit  of Diamante Pass at an elevation of about 8,000 feet\" where they  obtained an adult male.    *_Icteria virens virens_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimens examined:_ total 3:  [Male] [Male] 32105-32106 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft.,  June 19, 1952; and [Female] 32107 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June  20, 1952.    From the paucity of records in the literature, I judge that the  Yellow-breasted Chat is uncommon in Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:265) listed _I. v. virens_ from Coahuila.  Findley saw a Yellow-breasted Chat 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de  Sabinas on June 22, 1952. The sizes of the testes (7x4 mm.; 12 mm.) of  Nos. 32105-32106, the size of the largest ovum (2 mm.) of No. 32107,  and the dates (June 19, 20) on which these specimens were obtained  indicate breeding by _I. v. virens_ in northeastern Coahuila, an area  southwest of the previously documented breeding range.    **_Icteria virens auricollis_ (Deppe).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore (1957:264) listed this subspecies of the Yellow-breasted Chat as  recorded from"]]]
