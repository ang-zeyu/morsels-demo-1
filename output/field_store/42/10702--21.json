In  1911 the proportion had very nearly fallen to four females for every  five males.    ~Increase and Incidence in N.W.F. Province.~--The incidence of the  population in the area covered by the five districts of the N.W.F.  Province is 164 per square mile. The district figures are given in the  map in the margin. The increase between 1901 and 1911 in these districts  was 7-1/2 p.c. There have been no severe outbreaks of plague like those  which have decimated the population of some of the Panjab districts.    [Illustration: Fig. 29. Map showing density of population in N.W.F.  Province.]    General figures for the territory of the Maharaja of Kashmir are  meaningless. In the huge Indus valley the incidence is only 4 persons  per sq. mile. In Jammu and Kashmir it is 138. The map taken from the  Census Report gives the details. The increase in the decade was on  paper 8-1/2 p.c., distributed between 5-1/4 in Jammu, 12 in Kashmir, and  14 in the Indus valley. A great part of the increase in the last must be  put down to better enumeration.    [Illustration: Fig. 30. Map showing density of population in Kashmir.]    ~Health and duration of life.~--The climate of the Panjab plains has  produced a vigorous, but not a long-lived, race. The mean age of the  whole population in the British districts is only 25. The normal  birth-rate of the Panjab is about 41 per 1000, which exceeds the English  rate in the proportion of 5 to 3. In 1910 the recorded birth-rate in the  N.W.F. Province was 38 per 1000. Till plague appeared the Panjab  death-rate averaged 32 or 33 per 1000, or more than double that of  England. The infantile mortality is enormous, and one out of every four  or five children fails to survive its first year. The death-rate in the  N.W.F. Province was 27 per 1000 in 1910. In the ten years ending 1910  plague pushed up the average death-rate in the Panjab to 43-1/2 per  1000. Even now malarial fever is a far worse foe than plague. The  average annual deaths in the ten years ending 1910 were:      Fevers              450,376    Plague              202,522    Other diseases      231,473                        -------    Total               884,371                        -------    Fever is very rife in October and November, and these are the most  unhealthy months in the year, March and April being the best. The  variations under fevers and plague from year to year are enormous. In  1907 the latter claimed 608,685 victims, and the provincial death-rate  reached the appalling figure of 61 per 1000. Next year the plague  mortality dropped to 30,708, but there were 697,058 deaths from fever.  There is unfortunately no reason to believe that plague has spent its  force or that the people as a whole will in the near future generally  accept the protective measures of inoculation and evacuation.  Vaccination, the prejudice against which has largely disappeared, has  robbed the small-pox goddess of many offerings. As a general cause of  mortality the effect of cholera in the Panjab is now insignificant. But  it is still to be feared in the Kashmir valley, especially in the  picturesque but filthy summer capital. Syphilis is very common in the  hill country in the north-east of the province. Blindness and leprosy  are both markedly on the decrease. Both infirmities are common in  Kashmir, especially the former. The rigours of the climate in a large  part of the State force the people to live day and night for the seven  winter months almost entirely in dark and smoky huts, and it is small  wonder that their eyesight is ruined.    ~Occupations.~--The Panjab is preeminently an agricultural country, and  the same is true in an almost greater degree of the N.W.F. Province and  Kashmir. The typical holding is that of the small landowner tilling from  3 to 10 acres with his own hands with or without help from village  menials. The tenant class is increasing, but there are still three  owners to two tenants. Together they make up 50 p.c. of the population  of the Panjab, and 5 p.c. is added for farm labourers. Altogether,  according to the census returns 58 p.c. of the population depends for  its support on the soil, 20.5 on industries, chiefly the handicrafts of  the weaver, potter, leather worker, carpenter, and blacksmith, 9.4 on  trade, 2.5 on professions, and 9.6 on other sources of livelihood.    ~Measures taken to protect agriculturists.~--In a country owned so largely  by small farmers, the first task of the Government must be to secure  their welfare and contentment. Before plague laid its grasp on the rich  central districts it was feared that they were becoming congested, and  the canal colonization schemes referred to in a later chapter were  largely designed to relieve them. But there is a much subtler foe to  whose insidious attacks small owners are liable, the temptation to abuse  their credit till their acres are loaded with mortgages and finally  lost. So threatening had this economic disease for years appeared that  at last in 1900 the Panjab Alienation of Land Act was passed, which  forbade sales by people of agricultural tribes to other classes without  the sanction of the district officer, and greatly restricted the power  of mortgaging. The same restrictions are in force in the N.W.F.  Province. The Act is popular with those for whose benefit it was  devised, and has effected its object of checking land alienation and  probably to some extent discouraged extravagance. It has been  supplemented by a still more valuable measure, the Co-operative Credit  Societies Act. The growth of these societies in the Panjab has been very  remarkable, a notable contrast to the very slow advance of the similar  movement in England. In 1913-14 there were 3261 village banks with  155,250 members and a working capital of 133-3/4 _lakhs_ or L885,149,  besides 38 central banks with a capital of 42-3/4 _lakhs_ or about  L285,000. Village banks held deposits amounting to nearly 37 _lakhs_,  more than half of which was received from non-members, and lent out  71-1/2 _lakhs_ in the year to their members.    ~Tribal Composition.~--Table I based on the Census returns shows the  percentages of the total population belonging to the chief tribes. The  classification into \"land-holding, etc.\" is a rough one.    [Illustration: Fig. 31. Jat Sikh Officers (father and son).]    ~Jats.~--The Panjab is _par excellence_ the home of the Jats. Everywhere  in the plains, except in the extreme north-west corner of the province,  they form a large element in the population. In the east they are  Hindus, in the centre Sikhs and Muhammadans, and in the west  Muhammadans. The Jat is a typical son of the soil, strong and sturdy,  hardworking and brave, a fine soldier and an excellent farmer, but  slow-witted and grasping. The Sikh Jat finds an honourable outlet for  his overflowing energy in the army and in the service of the Crown  beyond the bounds of India. When he misses that he sometimes takes to  dacoity. Unfortunately he is often given to strong drink, and, when his  passions or his greed are aroused, can be exceedingly brutal. Jat in the  Western Panjab is applied to a large number of tribes, whose ethnical  affinities are somewhat dubious.    ~Rajputs.~--Rajputs are found in considerable numbers all over the  province except in a few of the western and south-western districts. As  farmers they are much hampered by caste rules which forbid the  employment of their women in the fields, and the prohibition of widow  remarriage is a severe handicap. They are generally classed as poor  cultivators, and this is usually, but by no means universally, a true  description. The Dogra Rajputs of the low hills are good soldiers. They  are numerous in Kangra and in the Jammu province of Kashmir.    ~Brahmans.~--The Brahmans of the eastern plains and north-eastern hills  are mostly agriculturists, and the Muhial Brahman of the north-western  districts is a landowner and a soldier. In the hills the Brahman is  often a shopkeeper. The priestly Brahman is found everywhere, but his  spiritual authority has always been far less in the Panjab than in most  parts of India.    ~Biluches.~--When the frontier was separated off the Biluch district of  Dera Ghazi Khan with its strong tribal organization under chiefs or  _tumandars_ was left in the Panjab. The Biluches are a frank, manly,  truthful race, free from fanaticism and ready as a rule to follow their  chiefs. They are fine horsemen. Unfortunately it is difficult to get  them to enlist.    ~Pathans.~--Both politically and numerically the Pathans are the  predominant tribe in the N.W.F. Province, and are of importance in parts  of the Panjab districts of Attock and Mianwali. The Pathan is a democrat  and often a fanatic, more under the influence of _mullahs_ than of the  _maliks_ or headmen of his tribe. He has not the frank straightforward  nature of the Biluch, is untiring in pursuit of revenge, and is not free  from cruelty. But, when he has eaten the _Sarkar's_ salt, he is a very  brave and dashing soldier, and he is a faithful host to anyone whom he  has admitted under his roof.    ~Awans.~--The home of the Awan in the Panjab is the Salt Range and the  parts of Attock and Mianwali, lying to the north of it, and this tract  of country is known as the Awankari. In the N.W.F. Province they are,  after the Pathans, by far the largest tribe, and are specially numerous  in Peshawar and Hazara.    ~Shekhs.~--Of the Shekhs about half are Kureshis, Sadikis, and Ansaris of  foreign origin and high social standing. The rest are new converts to  Islam, often of the sweeper caste originally.    ~Saiyyids.~--Saiyyids are unsatisfactory landowners, and are kept going by  the offerings of their followers. They are mostly Shias. It is not  necessary to believe that they are all descended from the Prophet's  son-in-law, Ali.

(See remarks on the importance of having  strong stocks early in the Spring.)          CHAPTER VII.    ON THE ADVANTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE FOUND IN AN IMPROVED HIVE.      In this chapter, I shall enumerate certain very desirable, if not  necessary, qualities of a good hive. I have neither the taste nor the  time for the invidious work of disparaging other hives. I prefer  inviting the attention of bee-keepers to the importance of these  requisites; some of which, as I believe, are contained in no hive but my  own. Let them be most carefully examined, and if they commend themselves  to the enlightened judgment and good common sense of cultivators, let  them be employed to test the comparative merits of the various kinds of  hives in common use.    1. A good hive should give the Apiarian a perfect control over all the  combs: so that any of them may be taken out at pleasure; and this,  without cutting them, or enraging the bees.    This advantage is possessed by no hive in use, except my own; and it  forms the very foundation of an improved and profitable system of  bee-culture. Unless the combs are at the entire command of the Apiarian,  he can have no effectual control over his bees. They swarm too much or  too little, just as suits themselves, and their owner is almost entirely  dependent upon their caprice.    2. It ought to afford suitable protection against extremes of heat and  cold, sudden changes of temperature, and the injurious effects of  dampness.    In winter, the interior of the hive should be dry, and not a particle of  frost should ever find admission; and in summer, the bees should not be  forced to work to disadvantage in a pent and almost suffocating heat.  (See these points discussed in the Chapter on Protection.)    3. It should permit all necessary operations to be performed without  hurting or killing a single bee.    Most hives are so constructed that it is impossible to manage them,  without at times injuring or destroying some of the bees. The mere  destruction of a few bees, would not, except on the score of humanity,  be of much consequence, if it did not very materially increase the  difficulty of managing them. Bees remember injuries done to any of their  number, for some time, and generally find an opportunity to avenge them.    4. It should allow every thing to be done that is necessary in the most  extensive management of bees, without incurring any serious risk of  exciting their anger. (See Chapter on the Anger of Bees.)    5. Not a single unnecessary step or motion ought to be required of a  single bee.    The honey harvest, in most locations, is of short continuance; and all  the arrangements of the hive should facilitate, to the utmost, the work  of the busy gatherers. Tall hives, therefore, and all such as compel  them to travel with their heavy burdens through densely crowded combs,  are very objectionable. The bees in my hive, instead of forcing their  way through thick clusters, can easily pass into the surplus honey  boxes, not only from any comb in the hive, but without traveling over  the combs at all.    6. It should afford suitable facilities for inspecting, at all times,  the condition of the bees.    When the sides of my hive are of glass, as soon as the outer cover is  elevated, the Apiarian has a view of the interior, and can often at a  glance, determine its condition. If the hive is of wood, or if he wishes  to make a more thorough examination, in a few minutes every comb may be  taken out, and separately inspected. In this way, the exact condition of  every colony may always be easily ascertained, and nothing left, as in  the common hives, to mere conjecture. This is an advantage, the  importance of which it would be difficult to over estimate. (See  Chapters on the loss of the queen, and on the Bee Moth.)    7. While the hive is of a size adapted to the natural instincts of the  bee, it should be capable of being readily adjusted to the wants of  small colonies.    If a small swarm is put into a large hive, they will be unable to  concentrate their animal heat, so as to work to the best advantage, and  will often become discouraged, and abandon their hive. If they are put  into a small hive, its limited dimensions will not afford them suitable  accommodations for increase. By means of my movable partition, my hive  can, in a few moments, be adapted to the wants of any colony however  small, and can, with equal facility, be enlarged from time to time, or  at once restored to its full dimensions.    8. It should allow the combs to be removed without any jarring.    Bees manifest the utmost aversion to any sudden jar; for it is in this  way, that their combs are loosened and detached. However firmly fastened  the frames may be in my hive, they can all be loosened in a few moments,  without injuring or exciting the bees.    9. It should allow every good piece of comb to be given to the bees,  instead of being melted into wax. (See Chapter on Comb.)    10. The construction of the hive should induce the bees to build their  combs with great regularity.    A hive which contains a large proportion of irregular comb, can never be  expected to prosper. Such comb is only suitable for storing honey, or  raising drones. This is one reason why so many colonies never flourish.  A glance will often show that a hive contains so much drone comb, as to  be unfit for the purposes of a stock hive.    11. It should furnish the means of procuring comb to be used as a guide  to the bees, in building regular combs in empty hives; and to induce  them more readily to take possession of the surplus honey receptacles.    It is well known that the presence of comb will induce bees to begin  work much more readily than they otherwise Would: this is especially the  case in glass vessels.    12. It should allow the removal of drone combs from the hive, to prevent  the breeding of too many drones. (See remarks on Drones.)    13. It should enable the Apiarian, when the combs become too old, to  remove them, and supply their place with new ones.    No hive can, in this respect, equal one in which, in a few moments, any  comb can be removed, and the part which is too old, be cut off. The  upper part of a comb, which is generally used for storing honey, will  last without renewal for many years.    14. It ought to furnish the greatest possible security against the  ravages of the Bee-Moth.    Neither before nor after it is occupied, ought there to be any cracks  or crevices in the interior. All such places will be filled by the bees  with propolis or bee-glue; a substance, which is always soft in the  summer heat of the hive, and which forms a most congenial place of  deposit for the eggs of the moth. If the sides of the hive are of glass,  and the corners are run with a melted mixture, three parts rosin, and  one part bees-wax, the bees will waste but little time in gathering  propolis, and the bee-moth will find but little chance for laying her  eggs, even if she should succeed in entering the hive.    My hives are so constructed, that if made of wood, they may be  thoroughly painted inside and outside, without being so smooth as to  annoy the bees; for they travel over the frames to which the combs are  attached; and thus whether the inside surface is glass or wood, it is  not liable to crack, or warp, or absorb moisture, after the hive is  occupied by the bees. If the hives are painted inside, it should be done  sometime before they are used. If the interior of the wooden hive is  brushed with a very hot mixture of the rosin and bees-wax, the hives may  be used immediately.    15. It should furnish some place accessible to the Apiarian, where the  bee-moth can be tempted to deposit her eggs, and the worms, when full  grown, to wind themselves in their cocoons. (See remarks on the  Bee-Moth.)    16. It should enable the Apiarian, if the bee-moth ever gains the upper  hand of the bees, to remove the combs, and expel the worms. (See  Bee-Moth.)    17. The bottom board should be permanently attached to the hive; for if  this is not done, it will be inconvenient to move the hive when bees are  in it, and next to impossible to prevent the depredations of moths and  worms.    Sooner or later, there will be crevices between the bottom board and the  sides of the hive, through which the moths will gain admission, and  under which the worms, when fully grown, will retreat to spin their  webs, and to be changed into moths, to enter in their turn, and lay  their eggs. Movable bottom hoards are a great nuisance in the Apiary,  and the construction of my hive, which enables me entirely to dispense  with them, will furnish a very great protection against the bee-moth.  There is no place where they can get in, except at the entrance for the  bees, and this may be contracted or enlarged, to suit the strength of  the colony; and from its peculiar shape, the bees are enabled to defend  it against intruders, with the greatest advantage.    18. The bottom-board should slant towards the entrance, to assist the  bees in carrying out the dead, and other useless substances; to aid them  in defending themselves against robbers; to carry off all moisture; and  to prevent the rain and snow from beating into the hive. As a farther  precaution against this last evil, the entrance ought to be under a  covered way, which should not, at once lead into the interior.    19. The bottom-board should be so constructed that it may be readily  cleared of dead bees in cold weather, when the bees are unable to attend  to this business themselves.    If suffered to remain, they often become mouldy, and injure the health  of the colony. If the bees drag them out, as they will do, if the  weather moderates, they often fall with them on the snow, and are so  chilled that they never rise again; for a bee generally retains its hold  in flying away with the dead, until"]]]
