[1] The Man in the Moon, according to an old popular legend.        CANTO XXI. Eighth Circle: fifth pit: barrators.--A magistrate of  Lucca.--The Malebranche.--Parley with them.    So from bridge to bridge we went, speaking other things, which my  Comedy careth not to sing, and held the summit, when we stopped  to see the next cleft of Malebolge and the next vain  lamentations; and I saw it wonderfully dark.    As in the Arsenal of the Venetians, in winter, the sticky pitch  for smearing their unsound vessels is boiling, because they  cannot go to sea, and, instead thereof, one builds him a new  bark, and one caulks the sides of that which hath made many a  voyage; one hammers at the prow, and one at the stern; another  makes oars, and another twists the cordage; and one the foresail  and the mainsail patches,--so, not by fire, but by divine art, a  thick pitch was boiling there below, which belimed the bank on  every side. I saw it, but saw not in it aught but the bubbles  which the boiling raised, and all of it swelling up and again  sinking compressed.    While I was gazing down there fixedly, my Leader, saying, \"Take  heed! take heed!\" drew me to himself from the place where I was  standing. Then I turned as one who is slow to see what it behoves  him to fly, and whom a sudden fear unnerves, and delays not to  depart in order to see. And I saw behind us a black devil come  running up along the crag. Ah! how fell he was in aspect, and how  rough he seemed to me in action, with wings open, and light upon  his feet! His shoulder, which was sharp and high, was laden by a  sinner with both haunches, the sinew of whose feet he held  clutched. \"O Malebranche[1] of our bridge,\" he said, \"lo, one of  the Ancients of Saint Zita[2] put him under, for I return again  to that city, which I have furnished well with them; every man  there is a barrator,[3] except Bonturo:[4] there, for money, of  No they make Ay.\" He hurled him down, and along the hard crag he  turned, and never mastiff loosed was in such haste to follow a  thief.    [1] Malebranche means Evil-claws.    [2] One of the chief magistrates of Lucca, whose special  protectress was Santa Zita.    [3] A corrupt official, selling justice or office for bribes; in  general, a peculator or cheat.    [4] Ironical.      That one sank under, and came up back uppermost, but the demons  that had shelter of the bridge cried out, \"Here the Holy Face[1]  avails not; here one swims otherwise than in the Serchio;[2]  therefore, if thou dost not want our grapples, make no show above  the pitch.\" Then they struck him with more than a hundred prongs,  and said, \"Covered must thou dance here, so that, if thou canst,  thou mayst swindle secretly.\" Not otherwise cooks make their  scullions plunge the meat with their hooks into the middle of the  cauldron, so that it may not float.    [1] An image of Christ upon the cross, ascribed to Nicodemus,  still venerated at Lucca.    [2] The river that runs not far from Lucca.      The good Master said to me, \"In order that it be not apparent  that thou art here, crouch down behind a splinter, that may  afford some screen to thee, and at any offense that may be done  to me be not afraid, for I have knowledge of these things,  because another time I was at such a fray.\"    Then he passed on beyond the head of the bridge, and when he  arrived upon the sixth bank, he had need of a steadfast front.  With such fury and with such storm, as dogs run out upon the poor  wretch, who of a sudden begs where he stops, they came forth from  under the little bridge, and turned against him all their forks.  But he cried out, \"Be no one of you savage; ere your hook take  hold of me, let one of you come forward that he may hear me, and  then take counsel as to grappling me.\" All cried out, \"Let  Malacoda[1] go!\" Whereon one moved, and the rest stood still; and  he came toward him, saying, \"What doth this avail him?\"  \"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to see me come here,\" said my Master,  \"safe hitherto from all your hindrances, except by Will Divine  and fate propitious? Let us go on, for in Heaven it is willed  that I show another this savage road.\" Then was his arrogance so  fallen that he let the hook drop at his feet, and said to the  rest, \"Now let him not be struck.\"    [1] Wicked tail.      And my Leader to me, \"O thou that sittest cowering among the  splinters of the bridge, securely now return to me.\" Whereat I  moved and came swiftly to him. And the devils all pressed  forward, so that I feared they would not keep their compact. And  thus I once saw the foot-soldiers afraid, who came out under  pledge from Caprona,[1] seeing themselves among so many enemies.  I drew with my whole body alongside my Leader, and turned not  mine eyes from their look, which was not good. They lowered their  forks, and, \"Wilt thou that I touch him on the rump?\" said one to  the other, and they answered, \"Yes, see thou nick it for him.\"  But that demon who was holding speech with my Leader turned very  quickly and said, \"Stay, stay, Scarmiglione!\"    [1] In August, 1290, the town of Caprona, on the Arno,  surrendered to the Florentine troops, with whom Dante was  serving.      Then he said to us, \"Further advance along this crag there cannot  be, because the sixth arch lies all shattered at the bottom. And  if to go forward still is your pleasure, go on along this rocky  bank; near by is another crag that affords a way. Yesterday, five  hours later than this hour, one thousand two hundred and  sixty-six years were complete since the way was broken here.[1] I  am sending thitherward some of these of mine, to see if any one  is airing himself; go ye with them, for they will not be wicked.  Come forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,\" began he to say, \"and  thou, Cagnazzo; and do thou, Barbariccia, guide the ten. Let  Libicocco come also, and Draghignazzo, tusked Ciriatto, and  Graffiacane, and Farfarello, and mad Rubicante. Search round  about the boiling pitch; let these be safe far as the next crag,  that all unbroken goes over these dens.\"    [1] By the earthquake at the death of the Saviour.      \"O me! Master, what is it that I see?\" said I; \"pray let us go  alone without escort, if thou knowest the way, for I desire it  not for myself. If thou art as wary as thou art wont to be, dost  thou not see that they show their teeth, and threaten harm to us  with their brows?\" And he to me, \"I would not have thee afraid.  Let them grin on at their will, for they are doing it at the  boiled wretches.\"    Upon the left bank they wheeled round, but first each had pressed  his tongue with his teeth toward their leader for a signal, and  he had made a trumpet of his rump.        CANTO XXII. Eighth Circle: fifth pit: barrators.--Ciampolo of  Navarre.--Fra Gomita.--Michaci Zanche.--Fray of the Malebranche.    I have seen of old horsemen moving camp, and beginning an  assault, and making their muster, and sometimes setting forth on  their escape; I have seen runners through your land, O Aretines,  and I have seen freebooters starting, tournaments struck and  jousts run, at times with trumpets, and at times with bells, with  drums, and with signals from strongholds, and with native things  and foreign,--but never with so strange a pipe did I see horsemen  or footmen set forth, or ship by sign of land or star.    We went along with the ten demons. Ah, the fell company! but in  the church with saints, and in the tavern with gluttons. Ever on  the pitch was I intent, to see every aspect of the pit, and of  the people that were burning in it.    As dolphins, when, by the arching of their back, they give a sign  to sailors that they take heed for the safety of their vessel,  so, now and then, to alleviate his pain, one of the sinners  showed his back and hid in less time than it lightens. And as at  the edge of the water of a ditch the frogs stand with only their  muzzle out, so that they conceal their feet and the rest of their  bulk, thus stood on every side the sinners; but as Barbariccia  approached so did they draw back beneath the boiling. I saw, and  still my heart shudders at it, one waiting, just as it happens  that one frog stays and another jumps. And Graffiacane, who was  nearest over against him, hooked him by his pitchy locks, and  drew him up so that he seemed to me an otter. I knew now the name  of every one of them, so had I noted them when they were chosen,  and when they had called each other I had listened how. \"O  Rubicante, see thou set thy claws upon him so thou flay him,\"  shouted all the accursed ones together.    And I, \"My Master, see, if thou canst, that thou find out who is  the luckless one come into the hands of his adversaries.\" My  Leader drew up to his side, asked him whence he was, and he  replied, \"I was born in the kingdom of Navarre; my mother placed  me in service of a lord, for she had borne me to a ribald,  destroyer of himself and of his substance. Afterward I was of the  household of the good King Thibault;[1] there I set myself to  practice barratry, for which I pay reckoning in this heat.\"      [1] Probably Thibault II., the brother-in-law of St Louis, who  accompanied him on his last disastrous crusade, and died on his  way home in 1270.    And Ciriatto, from whose mouth protruded on either side a tusk,  as in a boar, made him feel how one of them rips. Among evil cats  the mouse had come; but Barbariccia clasped him in his arms, and  said, \"Stand off, while I enfork him,\" and to my Master turned  his face. \"Ask,\" said he, \"if thou desirest to know more from  him, before some other undo him.\" The Leader, \"Now, then, tell of  the other sinners; knowst thou any one under the pitch who is  Italian?\" And he, \"I parted short while since from one who was a  neighbor to it; would that with him I still were covered so that  I might not fear claw or hook.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#17)"],[1," found in  nature in such a way as to be outside the singular, as the Platonists  held, although some say Plato believed that the separate man was only  in the Divine intellect. And hence it was not necessary for it to be  assumed by the Word, since it had been with Him from eternity.    Reply Obj. 3: Although human nature was not assumed in the concrete,  as if the suppositum were presupposed to the assumption, nevertheless  it is assumed in an individual, since it is assumed so as to be in an  individual.  _______________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 4, Art. 5]    Whether the Son of God Ought to Have Assumed Human Nature in All  Individuals?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God ought to have assumed  human nature in all individuals. For what is assumed first and by  itself is human nature. But what belongs essentially to a nature  belongs to all who exist in the nature. Therefore it was fitting that  human nature should be assumed by the Word of God in all its  supposita.    Obj. 2: Further, the Divine Incarnation proceeded from Divine Love;  hence it is written (John 3:16): \"God so loved the world as to give  His only-begotten Son.\" But love makes us give ourselves to our  friends as much as we can, and it was possible for the Son of God to  assume several human natures, as was said above (Q. 3, A. 7), and  with equal reason all. Hence it was fitting for the Son of God to  assume human nature in all its supposita.    Obj. 3: Further, a skilful workman completes his work in the shortest  manner possible. But it would have been a shorter way if all men had  been assumed to the natural sonship than for one natural Son to lead  many to the adoption of sons, as is written Gal. 4:5 (cf. Heb. 2:10).  Therefore human nature ought to have been assumed by God in all its  supposita.    _On the contrary,_ Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) that the  Son of God \"did not assume human nature as a species, nor did He  assume all its hypostases.\"    _I answer that,_ It was unfitting for human nature to be assumed by  the Word in all its supposita. First, because the multitude of  supposita of human nature, which are natural to it, would have been  taken away. For since we must not see any other suppositum in the  assumed nature, except the Person assuming, as was said above (A. 3),  if there was no human nature except what was assumed, it would follow  that there was but one suppositum of human nature, which is the  Person assuming. Secondly, because this would have been derogatory to  the dignity of the incarnate Son of God, as He is the First-born of  many brethren, according to the human nature, even as He is the  First-born of all creatures according to the Divine, for then all men  would be of equal dignity. Thirdly, because it is fitting that as one  Divine suppositum is incarnate, so He should assume one human nature,  so that on both sides unity might be found.    Reply Obj. 1: To be assumed belongs to the human nature of itself,  because it does not belong to it by reason of a person, as it belongs  to the Divine Nature to assume by reason of the Person; not, however,  that it belongs to it of itself as if belonging to its essential  principles, or as its natural property in which manner it would  belong to all its supposita.    Reply Obj. 2: The love of God to men is shown not merely in the  assumption of human nature, but especially in what He suffered in  human nature for other men, according to Rom. 5:8: \"But God  commendeth His charity towards us; because when as yet we were  sinners . . . Christ died for us,\" which would not have taken place  had He assumed human nature in all its supposita.    Reply Obj. 3: In order to shorten the way, which every skilful  workman does, what can be done by one must not be done by many. Hence  it was most fitting that by one man all the rest should be saved.  _______________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 4, Art. 6]    Whether It Was Fitting for the Son of God to Assume Human Nature of  the Stock of Adam?    Objection 1: It would seem that it was not fitting for the Son of God  to assume human nature of the stock of Adam, for the Apostle says  (Heb. 7:26): \"For it was fitting that we should have such a high  priest . . . separated from sinners.\" But He would have been still  further separated from sinners had He not assumed human nature of the  stock of Adam, a sinner. Hence it seems that He ought not to have  assumed human nature of the stock of Adam.    Obj. 2: Further, in every genus the principle is nobler than what is  from the principle. Hence, if He wished to assume human nature, He  ought to have assumed it in Adam himself.    Obj. 3: Further, the Gentiles were greater sinners than the Jews, as  a gloss says on Gal. 2:15: \"For we by nature are Jews, and not of the  Gentiles, sinners.\" Hence, if He wished to assume human nature from  sinners, He ought rather to have assumed it from the Gentiles than  from the stock of Abraham, who was just.    _On the contrary,_ (Luke 3), the genealogy of our Lord is traced back  to Adam.    _I answer that,_ As Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 18): \"God was able  to assume human nature elsewhere than from the stock of Adam, who by  his sin had fettered the whole human race; yet God judged it better  to assume human nature from the vanquished race, and thus to vanquish  the enemy of the human race.\" And this for three reasons: First,  because it would seem to belong to justice that he who sinned should  make amends; and hence that from the nature which he had corrupted  should be assumed that whereby satisfaction was to be made for the  whole nature. Secondly, it pertains to man's greater dignity that the  conqueror of the devil should spring from the stock conquered by the  devil. Thirdly, because God's power is thereby made more manifest,  since, from a corrupt and weakened nature, He assumed that which was  raised to such might and glory.    Reply Obj. 1: Christ ought to be separated from sinners as regards  sin, which He came to overthrow, and not as regards nature which He  came to save, and in which \"it behooved Him in all things to be made  like to His brethren,\" as the Apostle says (Heb. 2:17). And in this  is His innocence the more wonderful, seeing that though assumed from  a mass tainted by sin, His nature was endowed with such purity.    Reply Obj. 2: As was said above (ad 1) it behooved Him Who came to  take away sins to be separated from sinners as regards sin, to which  Adam was subject, whom Christ \"brought out of his sin,\" as is written  (Wis. 10:2). For it behooved Him Who came to cleanse all, not to need  cleansing Himself; just as in every genus of motion the first mover  is immovable as regards that motion, and the first to alter is itself  unalterable. Hence it was not fitting that He should assume human  nature in Adam himself.    Reply Obj. 3: Since Christ ought especially to be separated from  sinners as regards sin, and to possess the highest innocence, it was  fitting that between the first sinner and Christ some just men should  stand midway, in whom certain forecasts of (His) future holiness  should shine forth. And hence, even in the people from whom Christ  was to be born, God appointed signs of holiness, which began in  Abraham, who was the first to receive the promise of Christ, and  circumcision, as a sign that the covenant should be kept, as is  written (Gen. 17:11).  _______________________    QUESTION 5    OF THE PARTS OF HUMAN NATURE WHICH WERE ASSUMED  (In Four Articles)    We must now consider the assumption of the parts of human nature; and  under this head there are four points of inquiry:    (1) Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed a true body?    (2) Whether He ought to have assumed an earthly body, i.e. one of  flesh and blood?    (3) Whether He ought to have assumed a soul?    (4) Whether He ought to have assumed an intellect?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [III, Q. 5, Art. 1]    Whether the Son of God Ought to Have Assumed a True Body?    Objection 1: It would seem that the Son of God did not assume a true  body. For it is written (Phil. 2:7), that He was \"made in the  likeness of men.\" But what is something in truth is not said to be in  the likeness thereof. Therefore the Son of God did not assume a true  body.    Obj. 2: Further, the assumption of a body in no way diminishes the  dignity of the Godhead; for Pope Leo says (Serm. de Nativ.) that \"the  glorification did not absorb the lesser nature, nor did the  assumption lessen the higher.\" But it pertains to the dignity of God  to be altogether separated from bodies. Therefore it seems that by  the assumption God was not united to a body.    Obj. 3: Further, signs ought to correspond to the realities. But the  apparitions of the Old Testament which were signs of the  manifestation of Christ were not in a real body, but by visions in  the imagination, as is plain from Isa. 60:1: \"I saw the Lord  sitting,\" etc. Hence it would seem that the apparition of the Son of  God in the world was not in a real body, but only in imagination.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 13): \"If the body  of Christ was a phantom, Christ deceived us, and if He deceived us,  He is not the Truth. But Christ is the Truth. Therefore His body was  not a phantom.\" Hence it is plain that He assumed a true body.    _I answer that,_ As is said (De Eccles. Dogm. ii). The Son of God was  not born in appearance only, as if He had an imaginary body; but His  body was real. The proof of this is threefold. First, from the  essence of human nature to which it pertains to have a true body.  Therefore granted, as already proved (Q. 4, A. 1), that it was  fitting for the Son of God to assume human nature, He must  consequently have assumed a real body. The second reason is taken  from what was done in the mystery of the Incarnation. For if His body  was not real but imaginary, He neither underwent a real death, nor of  "]]]
