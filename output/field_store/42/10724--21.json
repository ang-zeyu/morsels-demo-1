In a little  while they will come here and think I am dead and be happy. What do you  think about it?\"    Ka-wate said, \"I have no thoughts at all.\"    So Coyote explained his plan....    So Coyote lay as dead, and all the Hares and small animals saw him lying  in the river, and rejoiced that he was dead. The Hares decided to go in  a body and see the dead Coyote. Rejoicing over his death, they struck  him with their hands and kicked him. There were crowds of Hares and they  decided to have a great dance. Now and then a dancing Hare would stamp  upon Coyote who lay as if dead. During the dance the Hares clapped their  hands over their mouth and gave a whoop like a war-whoop.    Then Coyote rose quickly and took two clubs which the ka-wate had given  him, and together they killed all of the Hares. There was a great number  and they were piled up like stones.    Coyote said, \"Where shall I find fire to cook the hares? Ah,\" he said,  pointing across to a high rock, \"that rock gives good shade and it is  cool. I will find fire and cook my meat in the shade of that rock.\"    So they carried all the hares to that point and Coyote made a large fire  and threw them into it. When he had done this he was very warm and  tired. He lay down close to the rock in the shade.    After a while he said to Ka-wate, \"We will run a race. The one who wins  will have all the hares.\"    She said, \"How could I beat you? Your feet are so much larger than  mine.\"    Coyote said, \"I will allow you the start of me.\" He made a torch of the  inner shreds of cedar bark and wrapped it with yucca thread and lighted  it. Then he tied this torch to the end of his tail. He did this to see  that the ka-wate did not escape him.    Ka-wate started first, but when out of sight of Coyots, she slipped into  the house of Badger. Then Coyote started with the fire attached to his  tail. Wherever he touched the grass, he set fire to it. But Ka-wate  hurried back to the rock, carried all the hares on top except four tiny  ones, and then climbed up on the rock.    Coyote was surprised not to overtake her. He said, \"She must be very  quick. How could she run so fast?\" Then he returned to the rock, but did  not see her.    He was tired and sat down in the shade of the rock. \"Why does n't she  come?\" he said. \"Perhaps she will not come before night, her feet are so  small.\"    Ka-wate sat on the rock above and heard all he said. She watched him  take a stick and look into the mound for the hares. He pulled out a  small one which he threw away. But the second was smaller than the  first. Then a third and a fourth, each tiny, and all he threw away. \"I  do not care for the smaller ones,\" he said. \"There are so many here, I  will not eat the little ones.\" But he hunted and hunted in the mound of  ashes for the hares. All were gone.    He said, \"That woman has robbed me.\" Then he picked up the four little  ones and ate them. He looked about for Ka-wate but did not see her  because he did not look up. Then as he was tired and lay down to rest,  he looked up and saw her, with the cooked hares piled beside her.    Coyote was hungry. He begged her to throw one down. She threw a very  small one. Then Coyote became angry. And he was still more angry because  he could not climb the rock. She had gone where he could not go.          How the Rattlesnake Learned to Bite  Pima (Arizona)    After people and the animals were created, they all lived together.  Rattlesnake was there, and was called Soft Child because he was so soft  in his motions. The people liked to hear him rattle and little rest did  he get because they continually poked and scratched him so that he would  shake the rattles in his tail. At last Rattlesnake went to Elder Brother  to ask help. Elder Brother pulled a hair from his own lip, cut it in  short pieces, and made it into teeth for Soft Child.    \"If any one bothers you,\" he said, \"bite him.\"    That very evening Ta-api, Rabbit, came to Soft Child as he had done  before and scratched him. Soft Child raised his head and bit Rabbit.  Rabbit was angry and scratched again. Soft Child bit him again. Then  Rabbit ran about saying that Soft Child was angry and had bitten him.  Then he went to Rattlesnake again, and twice more he was bitten.    The bites made Rabbit very sick. He asked for a bed of cool sea sand.  Coyote was sent to the sea for the cool, damp sand. Then Rabbit asked  for the shade of bushes that he might feel the cool breeze. But at last  Rabbit died. He was the first creature which had died in this new world.    Then the people were troubled because they did not know what to do with  the body of Rabbit. One said, \"If we bury him, Coyote will surely dig  him up.\"    Another said, \"If we hide him, Coyote will surely find him.\"    And another said, \"If we put him in a tree, Coyote will surely climb  up.\"    So they decided to burn the body of Rabbit, and yet there was no fire on  earth.    Blue Fly said, \"Go to Sun and get some of the fire which he keeps in his  house,\" So Coyote scampered away, but he was sure the people were trying  to get rid of him so he kept looking back.    Then Blue Fly made the first fire drill. Taking a stick like an arrow he  twirled it in his hands, letting the lower end rest on a flat stick that  lay on the ground. Soon smoke began to arise, and then fire came. The  people gathered fuel and began their duty.    But Coyote, looking back, saw fire ascending. He turned and ran back as  fast as he could go. When the people saw him coming, they formed a ring,  but he raced around the circle until he saw two short men standing  together. He jumped over them, and seized the heart of Rabbit. But he  burned his mouth doing it, and it is black to this day.          Coyote and the Rattlesnake  Sia (New Mexico)    Coyote's house was not far from Rattlesnake's home. One morning when  they were out walking together, Coyote said to Rattlesnake,    \"To-morrow come to my house.\"    In the morning Rattlesnake went to Coyote's house. He moved slowly along  the floor, shaking his rattle. Coyote sat at one side, very much  frightened. The movements of the snake and the rattle frightened him.  Coyote had a pot of rabbit meat on the fire, which he placed in front of  the snake, saying,    \"Companion, eat.\"    \"I will not eat your meat. I do not understand your food,\" said  Rattlesnake.    \"What food do you eat?\"    \"I eat the yellow flowers of the corn.\"    Coyote at once began to search for the yellow corn flowers. When he  found some, Rattlesnake said,    \"Put some on top of my head so that I may eat it.\"    Coyote stood as far off as he could and placed the pollen on the snake's  head.    The snake said, \"Come nearer and put enough on my head so that I may  find it.\"    Coyote was very much afraid, but after a while he came nearer and did as  he was told.    Then the snake went away, saying,    \"Companion, to-morrow you come to my house.\"    \"All right,\" said Coyote. \"To-morrow I will come.\"    Coyote sat down and thought about the morrow. He thought a good deal  about what the snake might do. So he made a small rattle by placing tiny  pebbles in a gourd and fastened it to the end of his tail. He shook it a  while and was much pleased with it.    The next morning he started for the snake's house. He shook the rattle  on the end of his tail and smiled, and said to himself,    \"This is good. When I go into Rattlesnake's house, he will be very much  afraid of me.\"    Coyote did not walk into Snake's house, but moved like a snake. But  Coyote could not shake his rattle as the snake shook his. He had to hold  it in his hand. But when he shook his rattle, the snake seemed much  afraid, and said,    \"Companion, I am afraid of you.\"    Now Rattlesnake had a stew of rats on the fire, and he placed some  before Coyote. But Coyote said,    \"I do not understand your food. I cannot eat it because I do not  understand it.\"    Rattlesnake insisted upon his eating, but Coyote refused. He said,    \"If you put some of the flower of the corn on my head, I will eat. I  understand that food.\"    The snake took some corn pollen, but he pretended to be afraid of Coyote  and stood off some distance. Coyote said,    \"Come nearer and place it on top my head.\"    Snake replied, \"I am afraid of you.\"    Coyote said, \"Come nearer. I am not bad.\"    Then the snake came closer and put the pollen on top of Coyote's head.    But Coyote did not have the long tongue of the snake and he could not  get the pollen off the top of his head. He put out his tongue first on  one side of his nose and then on the other, but he could only reach to  the side of his nose. His efforts made the snake laugh, but the snake  put his hand over his mouth so Coyote should not see him laugh. Really,  the snake hid his head in his body.    At last Coyote went home. As he left the snake's house, he held his tail  in his hand and shook the rattle.    Snake cried, \"Oh, companion! I am so afraid of you!\" but really the  snake shook with laughter.    When Coyote reached his home he said to himself,    \"I was such a fool. Rattlesnake had much food to eat and I would not  take it. Now I am very hungry.\"    Then he went out in search of food.          Origin of the Saguaro and Palo Verde Cacti  Pima (Arizona)    Once upon a time an old Indian woman had two grandchildren. Every day  she ground wheat and corn between the grinding stones to make porridge  for them. One day as she put the water-olla on the fire outside the  house to heat the water, she told the children not to quarrel because  they might upset the olla. But the children began to quarrel. They upset  the olla and spilled the water and their grandmother spanked them.    Then the children were angry and ran away. They ran far away over the  mountains. The grandmother heard them whistling and she ran after them  and followed them from place to place, but she could not catch up with  them.    At last the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25049"],[0,"My Reminiscences of the Anglo-Boer War (#17)"],[1,"exhorting them to come in.    The majority of our Boer officers, however, remained faithful to their  vow, though since the country was partly occupied by the British it  was difficult to get in touch with the Commandant-General or the  Government, and the general demoralisation prevented many officers  from asserting their authority.    Generals Sarel Oosthuizen and H. L. Lemmer, both now deceased, were  sent to the north of Pretoria, to collect the burghers from the  western districts, and to generally rehabilitate their commandos. They  were followed by Assistant-Commandant General J. H. De la Rey and  State Attorney Smuts (our legal adviser). It was at this point,  indeed, that the supreme command of the western districts was assumed  by General De la Rey, who, on his way to the north, attacked and  defeated an English garrison at Selatsnek.    The \"reorganisation\" of our depleted commandos proceeded very well;  about 95 per cent. of the fighting Boers rejoined, and speedily the  commandos in the western districts had grown to about 7,000 men.    But just a few weeks after his arrival in the West Krugersdorp  district, poor, plucky Sarel Oosthuizen was severely wounded in the  battle of Dwarsvlei, and died of his wounds some time after.    General H. Lemmer, a promising soldier, whom we could ill spare, was  killed soon after while storming Lichtenburg under General De la Rey,  an engagement in which we did not succeed. We had much trouble in  replacing these two brave generals, whose names will live for all time  in the history of the Boer Republics.    It is hardly necessary to dwell on the splendid work done by  Assistant-Commandant-General De la Rey in the western districts.  Commandant-General Botha was also hard worked at this stage, and was  severely taxed reorganising his commandos and filling up the  lamentable vacancies caused by the deaths of Lemmer and Oosthuizen.    I have already pointed out that General De la Rey had taken with him  the remainder of the burghers from the western districts. The  following commandos were now left to us:--Krugersdorp and Germiston,  respectively, under the then Commandants J. Kemp and C. Gravett, and  the Johannesburg police, with some smaller commandos under the four  fighting generals, Douthwaith, Snyman (of Mafeking fame), Liebenberg,  and Du Toit. The last four generals were \"sent home\" and their  burghers with those of Krugersdorp, Germiston, Johannesburg, Boksburg  and the Mounted Police, were placed under my command, while I myself  was promoted to the rank of General. I had now under me 1,200 men, all  told--a very fair force.    I can hardly describe my feelings on hearing of my promotion to such a  responsible position. For the first time during the War I felt a sort  of trepidation. I had all sorts of misgivings; how should I be able  to properly guard the interests of such a great commando? Had I a  right to do so? Would the burghers be satisfied? It was all very well  to say that they would have to be satisfied, but if they had shown  signs of dissatisfaction I should have felt bound to resign. I am not  in the habit of blinking at facts; they are stern things. What was to  become of me if I had to tender my resignation? I was eager and rash,  like most young officers, for although the prospects of our cause were  not brilliant and our army had suffered some serious reverses, I still  had implicit faith in the future, and above all, in the justice of the  cause for which we were fighting. And I knew, moreover, that the  burghers we now had left with us were determined and firm.    There was only one way open to me: to take the bull by the horns. I  thought it my duty to go the round of all the commandos, call the  burghers together, tell them I had been appointed, ask them their  opinion on the appointment, and give them some particulars of the new  organisation.    I went to the Krugersdorp Commando first. All went well, and the  burghers comprising the force received me very cordially. There was a  lot of questioning and explanations; one of the commandants was so  moved by my address that he requested those who were present to  conclude the meeting by singing Psalm 134, verse 3, after which he  exhorted his fellow burghers in an impassioned speech to be obedient  and determined.    The worst of it was that he asked me to wind up by offering a prayer.  I felt as if I would gladly have welcomed the earth opening beneath  me. I had never been in such a predicament before. To refuse, to have  pleaded exoneration from this solemn duty, would have been fatal, for  a Boer general is expected, amongst other things, to conduct all  proceedings of a religious character. And not only Boer generals are  required to do this thing, but all subordinate officers, and an  officer who cannot offer a suitable prayer generally receives a hint  that he is not worthy of his position. In these matters the burghers  are backed up by the parsons.    There was, therefore, no help for it; I felt like a stranger in  Jerusalem, and resolved to mumble a bit of a prayer as well as I  could. I need not say it was short, but I doubt very much whether it  was appropriate, for all sorts of thoughts passed through my head, and  I felt as if all the bees in this world were buzzing about my ears. Of  course I had to shut my eyes; I knew that. But I had, moreover, to  screw them up, for I knew that everybody was watching me. I closed my  eyes very tightly, and presently there came a welcome \"Amen.\"    My old commando was now obliged to find a new commandant and I had to  take leave of them in that capacity. I was pleased to find the  officers and men were sorry to lose me as their commandant, but they  said they were proud of the distinction that had been conferred upon  me. Commandant F. Pienaar, who took my place, had soon to resign on  account of some rather serious irregularities. My younger brother, W.  J. Viljoen, who, at the time of writing, is, I believe, still in this  position, replaced him.    At the end of June my commandos marched from Balmoral to near  Donkerhoek in order to get in touch with the British. Only a few  outpost skirmishes took place.    My burghers captured half a score of Australians near Van der Merwe  Station, and three days afterwards three Johannesburgers were  surprised near Pienaarspoort. As far as our information went the  Donkerhoek Kopjes were in possession of General Pole-Carew, and on our  left General Hutton, with a strong mounted force, was operating near  Zwavelpoort and Tigerspoort. We had some sharp fighting with this  force for a couple of days, and had to call in reinforcements from the  Middelburg and Boksburg commandos.    The fighting line by this time had widely extended and was at least  sixty miles in length; on my right I had General D. Erasmus with the  Pretoria commando, and farther still to the right, nearer the  Pietersburg railway, the Waterberg and Zoutpansberg commandos were  positioned. General Pole-Carew tried to rush us several times with his  cavalry, but had to retire each time. Commandant-General Botha finally  directed us to attack General Hutton's position, and I realised what  this involved. It would be the first fight I had to direct as a  fighting general. Much would depend on the issue, and I fully  understood that my influence with, and my prestige among, the burghers  in the future was absolutely at stake.    General Hutton's main force was encamped in a \"donk\" at the very top  of the randt, almost equidistant from Tigerspoort, Zwavelpoort and  Bapsfontein. Encircling his laager was another chain of \"randten\"  entirely occupied and fortified, and we soon realised what a large and  entrenched stretch of ground it was. The Commandant-General,  accompanied by the French, Dutch, American and Russian attaches, would  follow the attack from a high point and keep in touch with me by means  of a heliograph, thus enabling Botha to keep well posted about the  course of the battle, and to send instructions if required.    During the night of the 13th of July we marched in the following  order: On the right were the Johannesburg and Germiston commandos; in  the centre the Krugersdorp and the Johannesburg Police; and on the  left the Boksburg and Middelburg commandos. At daybreak I ordered a  general storming of the enemy's entrenchments. I placed a Krupp gun  and a Creusot on the left flank, another Krupp and some pom-poms to  the right, while I had an English 15-pounder (an Armstrong) mounted in  the centre. Several positions were taken by storm with little or no  fighting. It was my right flank which met with the only stubborn  resistance from a strongly fortified point occupied by a company of  Australians.    Soon after this position was in our possession, and we had taken 32  prisoners, with a captain and a lieutenant. When Commandant Gravett  had taken the first trenches we were stubbornly opposed in a position  defended by the Irish Fusiliers, who were fighting with great  determination. Our burghers charged right into the trenches; and a  hand-to-hand combat ensued. The butt-ends of the guns were freely  used, and lumps of rock were thrown about. We made a few prisoners and  took a pom-pom, which, to my deep regret, on reinforcements with guns  coming up to the enemy, we had to abandon, with a loss of five men.  Meanwhile, the Krugersdorpers and Johannesburg Police had succeeded in  occupying other positions and making several prisoners, while half a  dozen dead and wounded were left on the field.    The ground was so exposed that my left wing could not storm the  enemy's main force, especially as his outposts had noticed our march  before sunrise and had brought up a battery of guns, and in this flat  field a charge would have cost too many lives.    We landed several shells into the enemy's laager, and if we had been  able to get nearer he would certainly have been compelled to run.    When darkness"]]]
