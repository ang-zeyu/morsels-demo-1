Like a swift fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud,           A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,           He passeth from life to his rest in the grave:'\"      \"THE LONG NINE\" AND THE REMOVAL TO SPRINGFIELD    Two years was the term for which Lincoln was elected to the Legislature.  The year following the death of Ann Rutledge he threw himself into a  vigorous campaign for re-election. He had found much to do at Vandalia.  The greatest thing was the proposed removal of the State capital to  Springfield. In this enterprise he had the co-operation of a group of  tall men, known as \"the Long Nine,\" of whom he was the tallest and came  to be the leader.    Lincoln announced his second candidacy in this brief, informal letter in  the county paper:                                  \"NEW SALEM, June 13, 1836.            \"TO THE EDITOR OR THE JOURNAL:            \"In your paper of last Saturday I see a          communication over the signature of 'Many          Voters' in which the candidates who are          announced in the _Journal_ are called upon to          'show their hands.'            \"Agreed. Here's mine:            \"I go in for all sharing the privileges of the          government who assist in bearing its burdens.          Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to          the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear          arms (by no means excluding females).            \"If elected, I shall consider the whole people          of Sangamon my constituents, as well those that          oppose as those that support me.            \"While acting as their Representative, I shall          be governed by their will on all subjects upon          which I have the means of knowing what their          will is; and upon all others I shall do what my          own judgment teaches me will best advance          their interests. Whether elected or not, I go          for distributing the proceeds of public lands          to the several States to enable our State, in          common with others, to dig canals and construct          railroads without borrowing and paying interest          on it.            \"If alive on the first Monday in November, I          shall vote for Hugh L. White for President.                                \"Very respectfully,                                         \"A. LINCOLN.\"    The earliest railroads in the United States had been built during the  five years just preceding this announcement, the first one of all, only  thirteen miles long, near Baltimore, in 1831. It is interesting to  observe the enthusiasm with which the young frontier politician caught  the progressive idea, and how quickly the minds of the people turned  from impossible river \"improvements\" to the grand possibilities of  railway transportation.    Many are the stories of the remarkable Sangamon campaign in 1836. Rowan  Herndon, Abe's fellow pilot and storekeeper, told the following:      WINNING VOTES, WIELDING THE \"CRADLE\" IN A WHEAT FIELD    \"Abraham came to my house, near Island Grove, during harvest. There were  some thirty men in the field. He got his dinner and went out into the  field, where the men were at work. I gave him an introduction, and the  boys said that they could not vote for a man unless he could take a  hand.    \"'Well, boys,' said he, 'if that is all, I am sure of your votes' He  took the 'cradle' and led all the way round with perfect ease. The boys  were satisfied, and I don't think he lost a vote in the crowd.    \"The next day there was speaking at Berlin. He went from my house with  Dr. Barnett, who had asked me who this man Lincoln was. I told him that  he was a candidate for the Legislature. He laughed and said:    \"'Can't the party raise any better material than that?'    \"I said, 'Go to-morrow and hear him before you pronounce judgment.'    \"When he came back I said, 'Doctor, what do you say now?'    \"'Why, sir,' said he, 'he is a perfect \"take-in.\" He knows more than  all of them put together.'\"      TALKED TO A WOMAN WHILE HIS RIVAL MILKED    Young Lincoln happened to call to speak to a leading farmer in the  district, and found his rival, a Democratic candidate, there on the same  errand. The farmer was away from home, so each of the candidates did his  best to gain the good-will of the farmer's \"better half,\" who was on her  way to milk the cow. The Democrat seized the pail and insisted on doing  the work for her. Lincoln did not make the slightest objection, but  improved the opportunity thus given to chat with their hostess. This he  did so successfully that when his rival had finished the unpleasant  task, the only acknowledgment he received was a profusion of thanks from  the woman for the opportunity he had given her of having \"_such a  pleasant talk with Mr. Lincoln_!\"      HOW THE LIGHTNING STRUCK FORQUER, IN SPITE OF HIS LIGHTNING-ROD    Abe distinguished himself in his first political speech at Springfield,  the county seat. A leading citizen there, George Forquer, was accused  of changing his political opinions to secure a certain government  position; he also had his fine residence protected by the first  lightning-rod ever seen in that part of the country.    The contest was close and exciting. There were seven Democratic and  seven Whig candidates for the lower branch of the Legislature. Forquer,  though not a candidate, asked to be heard in reply to young Lincoln,  whom he proceeded to attack in a sneering overbearing way, ridiculing  the young man's appearance, dress, manners and so on. Turning to Lincoln  who then stood within a few feet of him, Forquer announced his intention  in these words: \"This young man must be taken down, and I am truly sorry  that the task devolves upon me.\"    The \"Clary's Grove Boys,\" who attended the meeting in a body--or a  gang!--could hardly be restrained from arising in their might and  smiting the pompous Forquer, hip and thigh.    But their hero, with pale face and flashing eyes, smiled as he shook his  head at them, and calmly answered the insulting speech of his opponent.  Among other things he said:    \"The gentleman commenced his speech by saying 'this young man,' alluding  to me, 'must be taken down.' I am not so young in years as I am in the  tricks and trades of a politician, but\"--pointing at Forquer--\"live long  or die young, I would rather die now than, like the gentleman, change my  politics, and with the change receive an office worth three thousand  dollars a year, and then feel obliged to erect a lightning-rod over my  house to protect a guilty conscience from an offended God!\"    This stroke blasted Forquer's political prospects forever, and satisfied  the Clary's Grove Boys that it was even better than all the things they  would have done to him.      ABE LINCOLN AS A \"BLOATED ARISTOCRAT\"    On another occasion Lincoln's wit suddenly turned the tables on an  abusive opponent. One of the Democratic orators was Colonel Dick Taylor,  a dapper, but bombastic little man, who rode in his carriage, and  dressed richly. But, politically, he boasted of belonging to the  Democrats, \"the bone and sinew, the hard-fisted yeomanry of the land,\"  and sneered at those \"rag barons,\" those Whig aristocrats, the \"silk  stocking gentry!\" As Abe Lincoln, the leading Whig present, was dressed  in Kentucky jeans, coarse boots, a checkered shirt without a collar or  necktie, and an old slouch hat, Colonel Taylor's attack on the \"bloated  Whig aristocracy\" sounded rather absurd.    Once the colonel made a gesture so violent that it tore his vest open  and exposed his elegant shirt ruffles, his gold watch-fob, his seals and  other ornaments to the view of all. Before Taylor, in his embarrassment,  could adjust his waistcoat, Lincoln stepped to the front exclaiming:    \"Behold the hard-fisted Democrat! Look at this specimen of 'bone and  sinew'--and here, gentlemen,\" laying his big work-bronzed hand on his  heart and bowing obsequiously--\"here, at your service, is your  'aristocrat!' Here is one of your 'silk stocking gentry!'\" Then  spreading out his great bony hands he continued, \"Here is your 'rag  baron' with his lily-white hands. Yes, I suppose I am, according to my  friend Taylor, a 'bloated aristocrat!'\"    The contrast was so ludicrous, and Abe had quoted the speaker's stock  phrases with such a marvelous mimicry that the crowd burst into a roar,  and Colonel Dick Taylor's usefulness as a campaign speaker was at an  end.    Small wonder, then, that young Lincoln's wit, wisdom and power of  ridicule made him known in that campaign as one of the greatest orators  in the State, or that he was elected by such an astonishing plurality  that the county, which had always been strongly Democratic, elected Whig  representatives that year.    After Herculean labors \"the Long Nine\" succeeded in having the State  capital removed from Vandalia to Springfield. This move added greatly to  the influence and renown of its \"prime mover,\" Abraham Lincoln, who was  feasted and \"toasted\" by the people of Springfield and by politicians  all over the State. After reading \"Blackstone\" during his political  campaigns, young Lincoln fell in again with Major John T. Stuart, whom  he had met in the Black Hawk War, and who gave him helpful advice and  lent him other books that he might \"read law.\"      THE LINCOLN-STONE PROTEST    Although he had no idea of it at the time, Abraham Lincoln took part in  a grander movement than the removal of a State capital. Resolutions were  adopted in the Legislature in favor of slavery and denouncing the hated  \"abolitionists\"--or people who spoke and wrote for the abolition of  slavery. It required true heroism for a young man thus to stand out  against the legislators of his State, but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#17)"],[1,"in any way with the religious instruction any native has  received from any source, I told him that was a matter for him to decide  himself; that each man was responsible for his own conduct. The boy  thought awhile--and he did not set his traps. Now that young man had  never received any instruction at a mission; all his teaching had been  from other Esquimaux. This same question of working on Sunday was the  cause of some of the difficulty between the missionary at Long Beach and  the miners at Shungnak. The sluicing or \"cleaning-up\" season is short,  and mining operators generally consider that they cannot afford to lose  an hour of it. The Kobuks employed by these miners quit their work on  Sunday, and that brought the operations to a standstill. There was  something to be said on the miners' side, but I rejoiced that the  Esquimau boys showed such steadfastness to their teaching. \"If you  cannot use them six days in the week, if it has to be seven or none,  then do as the miners on the Yukon side do, consider the country  uninhabited, and make your arrangements as though there were no Kobuks.\"  That was my advice, and this may be read in connection with Mr.  Stefanson's caustic comments on the same rigidity of observance.    We left Long Beach with a grateful feeling for the hospitality with  which we had been received and with a substantial respect for the  earnest missionary effort that was being put forth there. We were able  to replenish our grub supply and also to exchange our two toboggans for  one large sled, for we were out of the toboggan country again and they  had already become a nuisance, slipping and sliding about on the trail.  Our host was up early with a good breakfast for us, and speeded the  parting guest, which on the trail is certainly an essential part of true  hospitality, with all the honours; the natives lined up on the bank and  the younger ones running along with us for a few hundred yards.    [Sidenote: THE JADE MOUNTAINS]    Soon after we left the mission we went up a series of terraces to a  desolate, barren, wind-swept flat, the portage across which cut off a  great bend of the river and saved us many miles of travel. To our right  rose the Jade Mountains, whence the supply of this stone which used to  be of importance for arrow-heads and other implements was obtained and  carried far and wide. A light crust on the snow broke through at every  step, though the snow was not deep enough and the ground too uneven to  make snow-shoes useful; so we all had more or less sore feet that night  when we regained the river and made our camp near the mouth of the  Ambler, another tributary from the north.    The next day was an exceedingly long, tedious day. The Kobuk River,  which in its upper reaches is a very picturesque stream, began now to be  as monotonous as the lower Yukon. It had grown to considerable size, and  the bends to be great curves of many miles at a stretch, one of which,  a decided bend to the north of the general westerly direction of the  river, we were three full hours in passing down. It was while traversing  this bend that we witnessed a singular mirage that lent to the day all  the enlivenment it had. Before us for ten or twelve miles stretched the  broad white expanse of the river bed, shimmering in the mellow sunlight,  and far beyond, remote but clear, rose the sharp white peaks of the  mountains that divide the almost parallel valleys of the Kobuk and the  Noatak. As we travelled, these distant peaks began to take the most  fantastic shapes. They flattened into a level table-land, and then they  shot up into pinnacles and spires. Then they shrank together in the  middle and spread out on top till they looked like great domed  mushrooms. Then the broad convex tops separated themselves entirely from  their stalk-like bases and hung detached in the sky with daylight  underneath. And then these mushroom tops stretched out laterally and  threw up peaks of their own until there were distinct duplicate ranges,  one on the earth and one in the sky. It was fascinating to watch these  whimsical vagaries of nature that went on for hours. A change in one's  own position, from erect to stooping, caused the most convulsive  contortions, and when once I lay down on the trail that I might view the  scene through the lowest stratum of the agitated air, every peak shot up  suddenly far into the sky like the outspreading of one's fingers, to  subside as suddenly as I rose to my feet again. The psalmist's query  came naturally to the mind, \"Why hop ye so ye hills?\" and our Kobuk boy  Roxy, whose enjoyment of fine landscapes and strange sights was always  a pleasure to witness, answered the unspoken question. \"God make  mountains dance because spring come,\" he said prettily enough.    Then we crossed another portage and cut off ten miles of river by it,  and when we reached the river again I wanted to stop, for it grew  towards evening and here was good camping-ground. But we had lately met  some travelling Kobuks and they had told Roxy of a cabin \"just little  way\" farther on, and I yielded to the rest of the company, who would  push on to it and thus avoid the necessity of making camp. That native  \"just little way\" is worse than the Scotch \"mile and a bittock\"; indeed,  the natives have poor notion of distance in general, and miles have as  vague meaning to them as kilometres have to the average Anglo-Saxon.    [Sidenote: A BELATED CAMP]    On and on we pushed, mile after mile, and still no cabin. In the  gathering dusk we would continually think we saw it; half-fallen trees  or sloping branches simulating snow-covered gables. At last it grew  quite dark, and when there was general agreement that we must seek the  cabin no longer, but camp, there was no place to camp in. Either the  bank was inaccessible or there was lack of dry timber. We went on thus,  seeking rest and finding none, until seven-thirty, and then made camp by  candle-light, in a poor place at that, having trudged thirty-five miles  that day. A night-made camp is always an uncomfortable camp, and an  uncomfortable camp means a miserable night, which to-morrow must pay  for. We did not get to bed till nearly midnight, and it was  nine-forty-five when we started out next morning, and we made only  fifteen miles that day.    The Kobuk valley continued to open out wider and wider and the mountains  right and left to recede. The Jade Mountains were now dim and distant  behind us, and new ranges were coming into view. The people on this  lower river are very few. It was just about one hundred miles from Long  Beach when we reached the next native village, a miserable collection of  pole dwellings, half underground, with perhaps a score of inhabitants.  Certainly the conditions of life deteriorated as we descended this  river. The country seems to afford nothing but fish; we were amongst the  ichthyophagi pure and simple. Roxy, bred and born on the upper Kobuk and  never so far down before, is very scornful about it. \"Me no likee this  country,\" he says; \"no caribou, no ptarmigan, no rabbits, no timber, no  nothin'.\" The weather had grown raw and cold again, with a constant  disagreeable wind that took all the fun out of travelling. We passed a  place where a white man was pessimistically picking away at a vein of  coal in the river bluff. \"Yes, we been here all winter,\" he said,  \"working on the blamed ledge. I always knowed it was goin' to pinch out,  and now it's begun to pinch. My partner's gone to Candle for more grub,  but I told him it weren't no use. It's pinchin' out right now. I knowed  it afore we started work, but the blamed fool wouldn't listen to me.  'It'll pinch out,' I told him a dozen times; 'you mark my word it'll  pinch out,' I told him, and now it's begun to pinch; and I hope he'll be  satisfied.\" We were reminded of the many coal-mines from time to time  located on the Yukon, in all or nearly all of which the vein has  \"pinched out.\" The deposits on the coast may be all the fancy of the  magazine writer paints, and may hold the \"incalculable wealth\" that is  attributed to them, but the coal on the interior rivers seems in scant  measure and of inferior quality.    The same night we reached the native village at the mouth of the  Squirrel River, another northern tributary--the Kobuk receives most of  its waters from the north--and we spent the night and the next day,  which was Sunday, in one of the half-underground huts of the place, in  company with twelve other people. Here we found Roxy's brother, dubbed  \"Napoleon\" by some white man. They had not seen one another for years,  yet all the greeting was a mutual grunt. The Kobuks are not  demonstrative in their affections, but it would not be right to conclude  the affection lacking. I have seen an old Esquimau woman taking part in  a dance the night after her husband was buried, yet it would have been  unjust to have concluded that she was callous and indifferent. It is  very easy to misunderstand a strange people, and very hard to understand  them thoroughly.    [Sidenote: THE CANINE INTRUDER]    The roof of the tent was dome-shaped and it was lit by a seal-gut  skylight. In the morning while I was conducting Divine service and  attempting most lamely by the mouth of a poor interpreter to convey some  instruction, a dog fight outside adjourned to the roof and presently  both combatants came tumbling through the gut window into the midst of  the congregation. They were unceremoniously picked up and flung out of  the door, a few stitches with a needleful of sinew repaired the window,  and the proceedings were resumed. These gut windows have their  convenience as well as their inconvenience. When the hut gets too warm  and close even for Esquimaux, the seal gut is folded back and the outer  air rushes in to the great refreshment of the occupants; when the hut is  cool enough the gut is replaced.
