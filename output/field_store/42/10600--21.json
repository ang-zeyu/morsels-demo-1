I merely plead that you will extend to  them the royal prerogative of mercy--especially to two of their number,  Francisco and Mariano.\"    \"On what ground do you ask mercy for these?\" demanded Achmet sternly.    \"On the ground that courageous and worthy men, although tempted to rebel  in order to regain their liberty, are not deserving of death; that the  Portuguese girl your Highness was so generous as to send me, and who was  captured along with them, has interested me deeply in their history, and  also on the ground that one is the father and the other the brother of  your scrivano Lucien Rimini.\"    \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the Dey in surprise, \"Lucien never told me that,  although his own hand made out the order for their execution!\"    \"That,\" answered the consul, with a smile, \"is because I advised him to  leave the pleading of their cause to me.\"    \"Believing, no doubt,\" returned the Dey, with a laugh, \"that your powers  of persuasion are superior to his.  Well, Monsieur le Consul, you may be  right; nevertheless, let me tell you that short though the time be in  which Lucien has been my scrivano, there is that in his modest air and  ready will, as well as his talent, which constitutes a sufficient plea  to induce me to pardon his relations.\"    \"It rejoices me,\" said the consul, \"to find that, as I expected, your  highness's--\"    \"Yes, yes; say no more on that head,\" interrupted the Dey.  \"Here!  Lucien,\" he added, calling aloud to his secretary, who, clad in superb  Oriental costume, appeared at the door which led into his office, \"make  out an order to cancel the sentence against your father and brother, and  let them be sent to the palace immediately.  I will speak with thee  again on the matter.--Meanwhile, will Monsieur le Consul come and behold  the present which I am preparing for my royal master the Sublime Porte?\"    There was a touch of sarcasm in the tone in which he used the words  \"royal master,\" which the consul understood well enough, for he was  aware that although nominally subject to Turkey, Algiers was to all  intents and purposes an independent power, and that the present referred  to was almost all the benefit derived by the Sultan from his piratical  vassal.    It was costly enough, no doubt, viewed simply in the light of a gift,  and afforded a subject of great interest to the consul when permitted to  survey it--an honour, by the way, which the Dey would not have conferred  on the consul of any of the other nations represented at the Algerine  court, for the British consul at that time was, as we have said, a  special favourite.  It consisted of two magnificent milk-white Arab  horses, richly caparisoned; their saddles and bridles being profusely  ornamented with diamonds and other gems, and their shoes being made of  pure gold; several boxes of rare and costly jewels; six women-slaves  with skins of the most beautiful ebony tint; a number of black-maned  lions, several parrots, and a few monkeys.    \"Your highness is resolved to please the Sultan by means of variety,\"  observed the consul, with a smile, after commenting on the gift in  detail.    \"That,\" replied Achmet, \"would have little power to please if the jewels  were not numerous and costly.  But happily our treasury can afford it,  although we have not been very successful in war of late.\"    He looked at the consul with a sly smile as he spoke, but the latter  deemed it wise to be lost in admiration of some of the jewels in  question.    After examining the \"present,\" the consul retired, and Achmet went to  his private apartments to enjoy a cup of coffee and a pipe.    The room in which he sat was similar to that already described as being  the reception-room of the bridal party, only the decorations were if  possible more elaborate and sumptuous.  Here, seated on rich cushions,  with, not his most beautiful, but his wisest wife beside him, Achmet--  once a petty officer of janissaries--gave himself up to the enjoyment of  the hour.  Christian slaves--once the happy butterflies of European and  other lands--attended on him, filled his pipe, brought him hot coffee,  and watched his every movement.  They were richly dressed, more richly  and gaily, perchance, than they had ever been in the days of freedom,  when they had been wont to chat and laugh with careless hilarity.  But  they were mute enough now.  A few of them had tasted the bastinado and  been tamed; most of them had been wise enough to tame themselves.  If  Shakespeare had been a Turk he would probably have written a very  different version of the Taming of the Shrew!    When coffee was finished, the Dey ordered the attendants to withdraw,  and then settling himself comfortably on the cushions, and puffing two  white streams of smoke slowly through his nose, in order to gather the  fullest enjoyment therefrom, he thus addressed himself to his  better-proportion--we had almost said \"half,\" but forgot for the moment  that there were several Sultanas!    \"Ashweesha, thou art a wise woman.  I might almost style thee my  guardian angel, for not only hast thou often guided me on the right  road, but sometimes thou hast prevented me from straying into the  wrong.\"    Ashweesha, who was a sweet and passably good-looking woman of about  thirty, raised her large dark eyes to the face of Achmet with a look of  gratitude, but did not reply.  Indeed, her husband did not seem to  expect an answer, for he continued to smoke for some time in silence,  with his eyes fixed abstractedly on a tame gazelle--the kitten of the  harem--which tried to attract his attention.    \"Thou art sad, or anxious, to-night,\" said Ashweesha, at length breaking  silence.    \"Both sad and anxious,\" replied the Dey slowly.  \"My position is indeed  one of power, but not of comfort or safety.\"    A shade rested for a moment like a flitting cloud on the face of  Ashweesha.  Gladly would she have exchanged her high estate, with all  its costly and gorgeous array, for a life of humble toil accompanied  with peace and security--for she was of gentle nature--but this was  denied her.    \"Listen,\" said the Dey, laying aside his pipe and talking earnestly; \"it  may well chance, as it has happened before, that thy counsel may lighten  my care.  I am sad because two of my chief officers are snakes in the  grass.  They are venomous too, and their bite will prove deadly if it be  not avoided.  Canst thou guess their names, Ashweesha?\"    \"Sidi Omar and Sidi Hassan,\" said Ashweesha.    Achmet looked surprised.    \"Thou art partly right, though I did not expect thy swift reply.  Is it  a guess, or hast thou obtained information?\"    \"I have heard of it from one who is our friend.\"    \"Indeed.  Well, thou art right as to Omar, and it is that which makes me  sad.  Thou art right also in regard to Sidi Hassan, but I care little  for him.  He is but a tool in the hands of one whose power is great--  Hamet, our Aga of cavalry.  Omar I had hoped better things of; but fear  him not.  The Aga, however, is a dangerous foe, and unscrupulous.  I do  not clearly see my way to guard against his wiles.  My chief safeguard  is that he and Omar are bitter enemies.  I know not what to do.\"    \"The bow-string,\" suggested Ashweesha.    The reader must not think this suggestion inconsistent with the  character of one whom we have described as gentle and sweet.  The  Sultana had been trained in a peculiar school, and was as much  accustomed to hear of disagreeable and troublesome people being  strangled as Europeans are to the drowning of inconvenient kittens.    The Dey laughed.    \"Alas! my gentle one,\" he said, \"all powerful and despotic though I be,  there are a few officers around me whom I dare not get rid of in this  way--at least not just now.  But it amuses me to hear thee recommend  such strong measures, thou who art always on the side of mercy.\"    \"Truly,\" said Ashweesha, with a flash in her dark eyes that proved the  presence of other elements besides sweetness in her disposition, \"my  leanings are always towards mercy, save when you have to deal with those  who possess no mercy.  If you do not apply the bow-string to Hamet in  good time, rest assured that he will apply it to you.\"    The Dey became more serious at this, yet still smiled as he gazed in the  flushed countenance of his spouse and adviser.    \"Thou art right, Ashweesha,\" said he, in a meditative tone, \"and it is  for the purpose of finding out, if possible, when it is the right time  to strike that I now take counsel with thee.  What wouldst thou advise?\"    \"Sidi Hassan, you say, has been sent to be the British consul's  janissary?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"For what purpose?\" asked the Sultana.    \"Partly to keep him out of the way of the mischief which is always  brewing more or less in this warlike city; partly to flatter his vanity  by placing him in the service of one for whom he knows that I entertain  great respect, personally, as well as on account of the powerful nation  which he represents; and partly to remind him gently of my power to  order him on any service that I please, and to cut off his insolent head  if so disposed.\"    \"That is so far well,\" said Ashweesha, letting her delicate  henna-stained fingers play idly with the gorgeous pearls which fell like  a lustrous fountain from her neck, \"but it is possible that he may  reflect on the propriety of trying to secure, at no distant date, a  master who will reward him more liberally without conveying covert  threats.  But much good,\" she hastened to add, observing that her lord  did not much relish her last remark, \"much good may result from his  being placed under the British consul's roof; for the consul's wife is a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#17)"],[1," the girl, with a look of grave simplicity.    \"Did I speak?\" returned Lawrence, a little confused.    \"Yes--you say, `Ay, ay.  Well, well.  _What_ a pittie!'\"    \"Oh!--ah!--yes--I was only _thinking_, Manuela.  What will you have?\"    \"Som muttin,\" replied the girl, with a pursing of the little mouth that  indicated a tendency to laugh.    \"It is not mutton.  It's beef, I think.\"    \"Well, bee-eef very naice--an' som' gravvie too, plee-ese.\"    She went off at this point into a rippling laugh, which, being  infectious in its nature, also set her companion off, but the entrance  of the landlord checked them both.  He sat down at a small table near to  them, and, being joined by a friend, called for a bottle of wine.    \"Hotter than ever,\" he remarked to Lawrence.    \"Yes, very sultry indeed.\"    \"Shouldn't wonder if we was to have a sharpish touch or two to-night.\"    To which his friend, who was also an American if not an Englishman, and  appeared to be sceptical in his nature, replied, \"Gammon!\"    This led to a conversation between the two which is not worthy of  record, as it was chiefly speculative in regard to earthquakes in  general, and tailed off into guesses as to social convulsions present,  past or pending.  One remark they made, however, which attracted the  attention of our hero, and made him wish to hear more.  It had reference  to some desperate character whose name he failed to catch, but who was  said to be in the neighbourhood again, \"trying to raise men to join his  band of robbers,\" the landlord supposed, to which the landlord's friend  replied with emphasis that he had come to the right place, for, as far  as his experience went, San Ambrosio was swarming with men that seemed  fit for anything--from \"pitch-and-toss to manslaughter.\"    Not wishing, apparently, to hear anything more about such disagreeable  characters and subjects, Manuela rose at the conclusion of the meal and  retired to her apartment, while Lawrence continued to sip his coffee in  a balcony which overlooked the vineyard behind the hotel.    It was evening, and, although unusually warm, the weather was very  enjoyable, for a profound calm reigned around, and the hum of the  multitudes in the distant square seemed hushed as the church bells rang  the hour for evening prayers.  As the twilight deepened, and the stars  came faintly into sight in the dark-blue vault above, the thoughts of  Lawrence became strangely saddened, and, gradually quitting the scene of  peaceful beauty on which he gazed, sped over the Cordillera of the Andes  to that home of his boyhood which now lay in ashes.  The frame of mind  thus induced naturally led him to dwell on past scenes in which his  mother had taken a part, and he was still meditating, more than half  asleep, on the joys which were never to return, when he was roused into  sudden and thorough consciousness by something--he could not tell what--  a sort of sensation--which caused him to leap from his chair.    At the same moment there arose from the streets a cry, or wail.  Suddenly a rumbling noise was heard.  Lawrence bounded towards the  nearest door.  Full well he knew what it meant.  Before he could escape  there was a tremendous upheaval of the solid earth, and in one instant,  without further warning, the entire town fell with one mighty crash!  Lawrence just saw the walls and roof collapsing--then all was dark, and  consciousness forsook him.        CHAPTER TEN.    RECOUNTS SOME TERRIBLE AND SOME VIGOROUS DEEDS.    How long our hero lay in this state he could not tell, but on recovering  his faculties he became conscious of the fact that he was in total  darkness, lying on his back, with a tremendous weight pressing on his  chest.  For a few moments he remained still, quite unable to recollect  what had occurred, or where he was.    Suddenly memory resumed its office--the earthquake! the fall of the  hotel!--and, with a gush of horror, he realised the terrible truth that  he was buried alive.    The reader must have been in the position we describe to understand  fully the feelings of the poor youth at that moment.  His first impulse  was to make a violent effort to shake off the intolerable weight that  almost suffocated him; but his efforts, strong though he was, proved in  vain.  It felt as if a mountain held him down.  Then the thought of  Manuela rushed in upon him, and he uttered a loud cry.  The sound of his  voice in the confined space was terrible.  It seemed to rush in upon his  brain with awful din.  In his agony, a feeling of frantic despair came  over him, and, with the strength of a giant, he struggled to be free,  but still without success.  Exhausted as much by his horror as by his  efforts, he lay for some minutes quite still, his brain keenly alive and  thirsting, as it were, for some sound that might convey hope.  No sound  was to be heard, save the intense beating of his own pulsations which  seemed to throb into his ears, and down into his very extremities.    As he lay listening, it came strangely into his thoughts, with something  like a feeling of regret, that it would be very hard for him to die!  So  much strong life as he possessed must, he thought, take long to destroy!  But again, the memory of poor Manuela, perhaps in a similar condition,  and certainly not far from him, banished the thoughts of self, and he  listened once more intently.    All was still as the grave.  The effort at self-control, however, calmed  him a little, and, in a gentler mood, he tried to move his arms.  The  left arm was fixed as in a vice, and gave him so much pain, that he  feared it had been broken.  The right arm was also fast, but he felt  that he could move his hand.    It was a feeble straw for the buried man to clutch at, yet it was strong  enough to buoy up Hope in a stout heart.  His courage returned, and with  calm, resolute patience he set to work, uttering the fervent prayer,  \"Help me, O God!\"    Where there was space for a hand to move freely, he knew there must be  space to remove rubbish, though it might be ever so little.  In a few  minutes some handful of earth were thrust aside.  Then, by drawing his  arm upwards and pushing it downwards, he loosened the rubbish around it,  and by slow degrees set it partially free.  If he had been entombed in  solid earth, this, he was well aware, could not have been possible; but,  rightly judging that in a mass of mingled bricks, mortar, and beams  there must be spaces more or less open, he worked away, with patience  and in hope.  The result was that he was able at last to touch with his  right hand the object which lay so crushingly on his chest.  It was an  enormous beam.  The utter impossibility of even moving it filled him for  a moment with despair, but again he cried to God for help.  The cry was  answered, truly and effectively, yet without a miracle, for the very act  of trust in the Almighty calmed his mind and set it free to consider  intelligently.    He could not hope to lift the beam.  It was far too heavy.  Being so  heavy, he knew it would have killed him outright if it had not been  checked in its descent, and partially supported somehow.  Might he not,  then, scrape away the rubbish on which he lay until he should, as it  were, sink away from the beam?  He tried at once, and managed to get his  right hand slightly under him.  He could reach his haunch.  It was a  terribly slow process, but by degrees the busy hand reached the waist,  drawing the rubbish out by small portions at a time.  It seemed to him  as if hours were spent in these painful efforts.  Still no appreciable  difference was made in his position, and he had by that time pushed his  hand as far up under his back towards his neck as it was possible to  turn it.  Finding that he could scrape away no more in that direction,  he now sought to deepen the hollows already made.  In doing so he got  hold of a brick, which he wrenched out with a desperate effort.  The  result was instantaneous relief, for he seemed to subside, not much,  indeed, but sufficiently to permit of his breathing freely.    With a fervent exclamation of thankfulness he turned slightly round, and  drew his left arm out from the rubbish.  He felt it anxiously.  It was  bruised a good deal, but not broken.    Although so greatly relieved that he felt for a few moments almost as if  he had been delivered from death, the poor youth was still in a terrible  case.  The space in which he was confined did not admit of his sitting  up, much less standing.  What seemed to be a solid mass of the fallen  wall was above him, prevented from crushing him by the beam before  mentioned, while around him were masses of brick and mortar densely  packed.    Again exerting his lungs, the youth shouted with all his might, and then  paused to listen; but there was no reply.  Then he shouted the name of  Manuela, in the hope that she might hear, and answer, if still alive.  But no answering voice replied.    Believing now that nothing could save him but a fixed purpose and a  prolonged desperate effort on an intelligent plan, he prayed again for  help, and then proceeded to enlarge his tomb by scraping the rubbish  back under the beam, from beneath which he had drawn himself, and  packing it tightly down.  This enlarged the space, enabling him to get  upon his knees.  To work upward through the fallen wall would, he knew,  be an impossibility.  He therefore worked horizontally for some time,  throwing the rubbish between his legs behind him, as, we presume, the  moles are accustomed to do.  Then he passed his hand along over his  head, and found that the solid wall was no longer above him,--only  disjointed bricks and beams.    With renewed hope and redoubled effort he now worked his way upwards,  although well-nigh suffocated by dust, as well as by smoke arising from  fires which had broken out in many places all over the ruined town.  Suddenly, while thus engaged, he heard voices faintly."]]]
