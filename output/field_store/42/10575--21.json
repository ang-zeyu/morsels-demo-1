They had  evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking  shillings about to the men.  I followed him some distance, but he  subsided into an ale-house:  so I went back to the yard, and, happening  to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over  the launch.  He is to stand at water's edge and wave his handkerchief  to us when they start.  We shall be lying off in the stream, and it  will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\"    \"You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or  not,\" said Jones; \"but if the affair were in my hands I should have had  a body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came  down.\"    \"Which would have been never.  This man Small is a pretty shrewd  fellow.  He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him  suspicious lie snug for another week.\"    \"But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their  hiding-place,\" said I.    \"In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred  to one against Smith knowing where they live.  As long as he has liquor  and good pay, why should he ask questions?  They send him messages what  to do.  No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\"    While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the  long series of bridges which span the Thames.  As we passed the City  the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St.  Paul's.  It was twilight before we reached the Tower.    \"That is Jacobson's Yard,\" said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts  and rigging on the Surrey side.  \"Cruise gently up and down here under  cover of this string of lighters.\"  He took a pair of night-glasses  from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \"I see my sentry at  his post,\" he remarked, \"but no sign of a handkerchief.\"    \"Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\" said  Jones, eagerly.  We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and  stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.    \"We have no right to take anything for granted,\" Holmes answered. \"It  is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be  certain.  From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they  can hardly see us.  It will be a clear night and plenty of light.  We  must stay where we are.  See how the folk swarm over yonder in the  gaslight.\"    \"They are coming from work in the yard.\"    \"Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little  immortal spark concealed about him.  You would not think it, to look at  them.  There is no a priori probability about it.  A strange enigma is  man!\"    \"Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\" I suggested.    \"Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,\" said Holmes.  \"He remarks  that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate  he becomes a mathematical certainty.  You can, for example, never  foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what  an average number will be up to.  Individuals vary, but percentages  remain constant.  So says the statistician. But do I see a  handkerchief?  Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.\"    \"Yes, it is your boy,\" I cried.  \"I can see him plainly.\"    \"And there is the Aurora,\" exclaimed Holmes, \"and going like the devil!  Full speed ahead, engineer.  Make after that launch with the yellow  light.  By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have  the heels of us!\"    She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two  or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we  saw her.  Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore,  going at a tremendous rate.  Jones looked gravely at her and shook his  head.    \"She is very fast,\" he said.  \"I doubt if we shall catch her.\"    \"We MUST catch her!\" cried Holmes, between his teeth.  \"Heap it on,  stokers!  Make her do all she can!  If we burn the boat we must have  them!\"    We were fairly after her now.  The furnaces roared, and the powerful  engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart.  Her sharp,  steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to  right and to left of us.  With every throb of the engines we sprang and  quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows  threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us.  Right ahead a  dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of  white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going.  We  flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind  this one and round the other.  Voices hailed us out of the darkness,  but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her  track.    \"Pile it on, men, pile it on!\" cried Holmes, looking down into the  engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,  aquiline face.  \"Get every pound of steam you can.\"    \"I think we gain a little,\" said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.    \"I am sure of it,\" said I.  \"We shall be up with her in a very few  minutes.\"    At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with  three barges in tow blundered in between us.  It was only by putting  our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could  round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred  yards.  She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain  twilight was setting into a clear starlit night.  Our boilers were  strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with  the fierce energy which was driving us along.  We had shot through the  Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up  again after rounding the Isle of Dogs.  The dull blur in front of us  resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora.  Jones  turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the  figures upon her deck.  One man sat by the stern, with something black  between his knees over which he stooped.  Beside him lay a dark mass  which looked like a Newfoundland dog.  The boy held the tiller, while  against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to  the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life.  They may have had some  doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as  we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no  longer be any question about it.  At Greenwich we were about three  hundred paces behind them.  At Blackwall we could not have been more  than two hundred and fifty.  I have coursed many creatures in many  countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such  a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames.  Steadily  we drew in upon them, yard by yard.  In the silence of the night we  could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery.  The man in the  stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though  he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure  with a glance the distance which still separated us.  Nearer we came  and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop.  We were not more than four  boat's lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace.  It  was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and  the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other.  At our hail the man  in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists  at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,  powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could  see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the  right side.  At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was  movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck.  It straightened itself  into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a great,  misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.  Holmes had  already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this  savage, distorted creature.  He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster  or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough  to give a man a sleepless night.  Never have I seen features so deeply  marked with all bestiality and cruelty.  His small eyes glowed and  burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from  his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.    \"Fire if he raises his hand,\" said Holmes, quietly.  We were within a  boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry.  I  can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs  far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his  hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light  of our lantern.    It was well that we had so clear a view of him.  Even as we looked he  plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like  a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out  together.  He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of  choking cough fell sideways into the stream.  I caught one glimpse of  his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters.  At the  same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put  it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank,  while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet.  We were  round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank.  It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide  expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of  decaying vegetation.  The launch with a dull"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#17)"],[1,"jes, now become so familiar. These  kopjes are of varying heights, from fifty to five hundred feet, and  consist mainly of large boulders, with, however, a plentiful  sprinkling of smaller rocks not too heavy for handling. The steepness  and roughness of the surface make climbing a matter {p.143} of hands  as well as of feet, and are therefore a source of particular  difficulty and exposure to an assailant; while, on the other hand, the  broken heaps of huge stones afford to the defence much natural  protection, and can be further improved by building shelter places,  which it was the habit of the Boer to do, forming semicircular  breastworks. In this way, with natural and artificial cover, was  obtained a strong line of defence, depending in extent upon the length  and formation of the kopje.    Superficial advantages at once strike the eye and impress the mind,  and it was to the kopje therefore that the Boer first looked as the  natural feature upon which to found his tactical and strategic scheme  of offence. Its command over the plain country, by permitting fire  tier above tier, compensated in part for any lack of development due  to limited length or other causes, and afforded also several lines of  defence to be successively occupied. But the height, while it imposes  difficulties upon the attacker, has also drawbacks of its own. A  downward, plunging fire demands definite precision and accuracy of  {p.144} aim, and in mark firing error in elevation is more commonly  found than swerving to the right or left. The ordinary shot is more  apt to fire over a man's head, or strike the ground ahead of him, than  to miss him to one side or the other. When, therefore, it had been  found by a few experiences--Talana Hill, Elandslaagte, Belmont and  Graspan, in all of which the kopje bore a principal part in the scheme  of defence--that the British soldier could not be stopped by them  alone, the Boers, without abandoning the kopjes, reinforced them where  the ground allowed by utilising the beds of the streams, which except  in time of flood are nearly waterless. Men looking over the edge of a  steep trench glance nearly along the ground in front of them, and if  that be clear, unless they are singularly inexpert, their shots sweep  along the surface so little above it that they are sure to catch men  in front, so far as their height is concerned. This was done at Modder  River, two-thirds of the way--forty-five miles--from Orange River, and  also at Colenso; while at the disastrous battle of Magersfontein the  Boers had strengthened one {p.145} flank of their line by an  artificial trench, which was backed by a kopje.    A peculiarity of the Boer tactical methods should here be described,  originating in their habits of life and curiously adapted to the  purely defensive scheme upon which they rely. Their aim is to consume  the opponent's strength by compelling him to frontal attacks upon well  covered men, who at the proper moment shall slip away, leaving the  enemy an empty position and the prospect of another similar experience  at each succeeding stage. To effect this, their horses were hobbled in  the rear of the line, protected by the kopje, if one, or by such other  means as offered; it is said even that many of the better to do,  coming from a distance, would ride one horse to the place as to a  hunting meet, and reserve a better and fresher for the retreat, which,  in the earlier stages of Methuen's advance, was probably intended from  the first. So far do they push the endeavour to leave a barren result  to the victor that they carry away upon their horses, as far as may be  and at some risk, not only their wounded but their dead; and of the  {p.146} latter those that cannot be removed are concealed. The  singularity of this point of honour, and the tenacity of its  observance, seem more congruous to primeval than to modern warfare.    The above description gives a general idea of the conditions  confronting Methuen on the 21st of November, when he began his  advance. In it he fought four actions: at Belmont, November 23; at  Graspan on the 25th; at Modder River on the 28th; and finally at  Magersfontein, December 11. These places are distant from Orange  River, approximately, 18, 28, and 45 miles; Magersfontein being some  three miles beyond the Modder.    The gathering of Methuen's division had not been unwatched by the  Boers, and their forces, which, in two principal bodies of about 3,000  each, had been besieging Mafeking and Kimberley, and in other smaller  detachments were scattered along the railroad between the two places,  began to concentrate. On the 16th of October, 2,000 had occupied the  Modder River Station. On the 10th of November a reconnaissance from  Orange {p.147} River had found them occupying the ridges about  Belmont, in numbers estimated at 700. At about the same time Kimberley  noticed that the besiegers were increasing in numbers, while at  Mafeking they were observed to be decreasing. On the 20th it was known  that Cronje, whose reputation as a leader stood high, had been  detached with his commando from before Mafeking, leaving it to the  care of the local Boer troops, and going south. To these and other  unrecorded movements of the same kind, all entirely correct in  principle, are to be attributed the increasing numbers which Methuen  encountered in his successive actions. It is to be remarked here that  the Boers knew that inadequate transport material tied the British  general to the railroad; and it was the continuance of this belief,  when the difficulty had been obviated, that betrayed Cronje to his  ruin at a later date.    Leaving Orange River on the early morning of Tuesday, November 21, the  army, having rested during the extreme heat of the noons, camped on  the evening of the 22nd within five miles of the enemy's position.  This {p.148} was west of Belmont Station, and is described as a line  of kopjes extending east and west, and about two hundred feet high.  Lord Methuen's purpose in this and other actions was to cross the more  dangerous open ground of the approach by dark, arriving at the foot of  the kopjes before daylight. His line of advance being, in a general  sense, parallel to the hostile front, it had been his intention that  the left wing, after securing an eminence called Table Mountain on the  enemy's right, should swing its own left around, performing a  flanking, or else a general turning movement, pivoting upon the right  wing. In the obscurity, however, the latter lost direction and the  general found himself in consequence committed to a frontal attack.  Orders were therefore sent to the left wing, which had not lost its  direction, to conform its movements to those of the right, and the  attack was delivered in front. The Boers are estimated to have been  2,000 to 2,500 men, the kopjes affording them three lines of defence  in successive ridges.    Although the error in direction had necessitated a change in the  method of attack, the {p.149} time had been exact; the line had  started at 3 A.M., reaching the foot of the hills before daybreak.  This could scarcely have been much later than 4 A.M., for in the  southern hemisphere summer was near. The musketry fire of the Boers  opened soon after, \"and the troops instinctively moved toward the  enemy's position.\" The advance was covered by artillery, which,  however, was slow in its movements, \"the horses not having yet  recovered from a five weeks' voyage.\" Criticism has said that the  artillery was not sufficiently employed to silence the enemy's  riflemen, but Lord Methuen alleges that shrapnel does not kill men in  kopjes; \"it only frightens them, and I intend to get at my enemy.\" The  inferiority of shrapnel to shell, in use against kopjes, has been  asserted by many observers. For these various reasons the battle of  Belmont reduced itself to a magnificent charge by a much superior  force up a stony and precipitous hill against an enemy strongly  intrenched. \"At 6.10 the last height was cleared, the enemy in large  numbers galloping into the plain, their laager trekking across me  3,000 yards off, {p.150} my mounted troops unable to carry out their  orders on one side--left--because the retreat was covered by kopjes,  and on the other--right--because too far; the artillery dead beat and  unable to help me. A cavalry brigade and a horse artillery battery  from my right would have made good my success.\" The British loss at  Belmont was 53 killed, 275 wounded; that of the Boers is not  accurately known.    Two days later at Graspan the Boers were in about the same force and  the natural conditions similar in general character. The Boer line  extended east and west, and at the latter end--their right--were \"two  high hills.\" These were bombarded with shrapnel, the effect of which  was more thoroughly tested, one battery alone firing 500 rounds to  clear the summit, before the infantry were allowed to advance. The men  again fought their way to the top, but again the enemy got away. \"The  heights gained, I found I had taken the whole Boer force in flank, and  had entirely cut them off from their line of retreat. My guns played  on the masses of horsemen, but my few cavalry, dead beat, were  {p.151} powerless, and for the second time I longed for a cavalry  brigade and horse artillery battery to let me reap the fruits of a  hard-fought action.\" \"The loss in both these actions,\" Methuen says,  \"was great, and convinces me that if an enemy has his heart in the  right place he ought to hold his own against vastly superior forces,  and it does our men great credit that nothing stops them.\"    Both actions, in short, illustrate the same lessons, the Boers'  particular advantages for defence, their readiness in retreat, and, it  must be added, the prompt facility with which they resorted to it.  When the most that can be said has been said for their methods--and  much can be said--it still remains "]]]
