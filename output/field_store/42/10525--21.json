In point of health, nothing  is more congenial to sound physical condition than the occasional smell  of a stable, or the breath of a cow, not within the immediate contiguity  to the occupied rooms of the dwelling. On the score of neatness,  therefore, as we have placed them, no bar can be raised to their  adoption.          DESIGN IV.      This is perhaps a more ambitious house than either of the preceding,  although it may be adapted to a domain of the same extent and value. It  is plain and unpretending in appearance; yet, in its ample finish, and  deeply drawn, sheltering eaves, broad veranda, and spacious  out-buildings, may give accommodation to a larger family indulging a  more liberal style of living than the last.    By an error in the engraving, the main roof of the house is made to  appear like a double, or gambrel-roof, breaking at the intersection of  the gable, or hanging roof over the ends. This is not so intended. The  roofs on each side are a straight line of rafters. The Swiss, or hanging  style of gable-roof is designed to give a more sheltered effect to the  elevation than to run the end walls to a peak in the point of the roof.    By a defect in the drawing, the roof of the veranda is not sufficiently  thrown over the columns. This roof should project at least one foot  beyond them, so as to perfectly shelter the mouldings beneath from the  weather, and conform to the style of the main roof of the house.      [Illustration: FARM HOUSE. Pages 115-116.]    The material of which it is built may be of either stone, brick, or  wood, as the taste or convenience of the proprietor may suggest. The  main building is 44x36 feet, on the ground. The cellar wall may show 18  to 24 inches above the ground, and be pierced by windows in each end, as  shown in the plan. The height of the main walls may be two full stories  below the roof plates, or the chambers may run a foot or two into the  garret, at the choice of the builder, either of which arrangements may  be permitted.    The front door opens from a veranda 28 feet long by 10 feet in depth,  dropping eight inches from the door-sill. This veranda has a hipped  roof, which juts over the columns in due proportion with the roof of the  house over its walls. These columns are plain, with brackets, or braces  from near their tops, sustaining the plate and finish of the roof above,  which may be covered either with tin or zinc, painted, or closely  shingled.    The walls of the house may be 18 to 20 feet high below the plates; the  roof a pitch of 30 to 45deg, which will afford an upper garret, or  store, or small sleeping rooms, if required; and the eaves should  project two to three feet, as climate may demand, over the walls. A  plain finish--that is, ceiled underneath--is shown in the design, but  brackets on the ends of the rafters, beaded and finished, may be shown,  if preferred. The gables are _Swiss-roofed_, or _truncated_, thus giving  them a most sheltered and comfortable appearance, particularly in a  northerly climate. The small gable in front relieves the roof of its  monotony, and affords light to the central garret. The chimneys are  carried out with partition flues, and may be topped with square caps, as  necessity or taste may demand.    Retreating three feet from the kitchen side of the house runs, at right  angles, a wing 30x18 feet, one and a half stories high, with a veranda  eight feet wide in front. Next in rear of this, continues a wood-house,  30x18 feet, one story high, with ten feet posts, and open in front, the  ground level of which is 18 inches below the floor of the wing to which  it is attached. The roof of these two is of like character with that of  the main building.    Adjoining this wood-house, and at right angles with it, is a building  68x18 feet, projecting two feet outside the line of wood-house and  kitchen. This building is one and a half stories high, with 12 feet  posts, and roof in the same style and of equal pitch as the others.        [Illustration: GROUND PLAN.]    INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT.    The front door from the veranda of the house opens into a hall, 18x8  feet, and 11 feet high, amply lighted by sash windows on the sides, and  over the door. From the rear of this hall runs a flight of easy stairs,  into the upper or chamber hall. On one side of the lower hall, a door  leads into a parlor, 18 feet square, and 11 feet high, lighted by three  windows, and warmed by an open stove, or fireplace, the pipe passing  into a chimney flue in the rear. A door passes from this parlor into a  rear passage, or entry, thus giving it access to the kitchen and rear  apartments. At the back end of the front hall, a door leads into the  rear passage and kitchen; and on the side opposite the parlor, a door  opens into the sitting or family room, 18x16 feet in area, having an  open fireplace, and three windows. On the hall side of this room, a door  passes into the kitchen, 22x16 feet, and which may, in case the  requirements of the family demand it, be made the chief family or living  room, and the last one described converted into a library. In this  kitchen, which is lighted by two windows, is a liberal open fireplace,  with an ample oven by its side, and a sink in the outer corner. A flight  of stairs, also, leads to the rear chambers above; and a corresponding  flight, under them, to the cellar below. A door at each end of these  stairs, leads into the back entry of the house, and thus to the other  interior rooms, or through the rear outer door to the back porch. This  back entry is lighted by a single sash window over the outside door  leading to the porch. Another door, opposite that leading down cellar,  opens into the passage through the wing. From the rear hall, which is  16x5 feet, the innermost passage leads into a family bedroom, or  nursery, 16x14 feet, lighted by a window in each outside wall, and  warmed by an open fireplace, or stove, at pleasure. Attached to this  bedroom is a clothes-closet, 8x4 feet, with shelves, and drawers. Next  the outer door, in rear end of the hall, is a small closet opening from  it, 6x4 feet in dimensions, convertible to any use which the mistress of  the house may direct.      [Illustration: CHAMBER PLAN.]    Opening into the wing from the kitchen, first, is a large closet and  pantry, supplied with a table, drawers, and shelves, in which are stored  the dishes, table furniture, and edibles necessary to be kept at a  moment's access. This room is 14x8 feet, and well lighted by a window of  convenient size. If necessary, this room may have a partition, shutting  off a part from the everyday uses which the family requires. In this  room, so near to the kitchen, to the sink, to hot-water, and the other  little domestic accessories which good housewives know so well how to  arrange and appreciate, all the nice little table-comforts can be got  up, and perfected, and stored away, under lock and key, in drawer, tub,  or jar, at their discretion, and still their eyes not be away from their  subordinates in the other departments. Next to this, and connected by a  door, is the dairy, or milk-room, also 14x8 feet; which, if necessary,  may be sunk three or four feet into the ground, for additional coolness  in the summer season, and the floor reached by steps. In this are ample  shelves for the milkpans, conveniences of churning, &c., &c. But, if the  dairy be a prominent object of the farm, a separate establishment will  be required, and the excavation may not be necessary for ordinary  household uses. Out of this milk-room, a door leads into a wash-room,  18x14 feet. A passage from the kitchen also leads into this. The  wash-room is lighted by two windows in rear, and one in front. A sink is  between the two rear windows, with conductor leading outside, and a  closet beneath it, for the iron ware. In the chimney, at the end, are  boilers, and a fireplace, an oven, or anything else required, and a door  leading to a platform in the wood-house, and so into the yard. On the  other side of the chimney, a door leads into a bathing-room, 7x6 feet,  into which hot water is drawn from one of the boilers adjoining, and  cold water may be introduced, by a hand-pump, through a pipe leading  into the well or cistern.    As no more convenient opportunity may present itself, a word or two will  be suggested as to the location of the bath-room in a country house. In  city houses, or country houses designed for the summer occupancy of city  dwellers, the bathing-rooms are usually placed in the second or chamber  story, and the water for their supply is drawn from cisterns still above  _them_. This arrangement, in city houses, is made chiefly from the want  of room on the ground floor; and, also, thus arranged in the  city-country houses, _because_ they are so constructed in the city. In  the farm house, or in the country house proper, occupied by whom it may  be, such arrangement is unnecessary, expensive, and inconvenient.  Unnecessary, because there is no want of room on the ground; expensive,  because an upper cistern is always liable to leakages, and a consequent  wastage of water, wetting, and rotting out the floors, and all the  slopping and dripping which such accidents occasion; and inconvenient,  from the continual up-and-down-stair labor of those who occupy the bath,  to say nothing of the piercing the walls of the house, for the admission  of pipes to lead in and let out the water, and the thousand-and-one  vexations, by way of plumbers' bills, and expense of getting to and from  the house itself, always a distance of some miles from the mechanic.    The only defence for such location of the bath-room and cisterns is, the  convenience and privacy of access to them, by the females of the family.  This counts but little, if anything, over the place appropriated in  this, and the succeeding designs of this work. The access is almost, if  not quite as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#17)"],[1," the end.      The above arrangements are found with scarcely any variation  in all the charter-houses of western Europe.  The Yorkshire  Charter-house of Mount Grace, founded by Thomas Holland, the  young duke of Surrey, nephew of Richard II. and marshal of  England, during the revival of the popularity of the order,  about A.D. 1397, is the most perfect and best preserved English  example.  It is characterized by all the simplicity of the  order.  The church is a modest building, long, narrow and  aisleless.  Within the wall of enclosure are two courts.  The smaller of the two, the south, presents the usual  arrangement of church, refectory, &c., opening out of a  cloister.  The buildings are plain and solid.  The northern  court contains the cells, 14 in number.  It is surrotmded by a  double stone wall, the two walls being about 30 ft. or 40 ft.  apart.  Between these, each in its own garden, stand the cells;  low-built two-storied cottages, of two or three rooms on the  ground-floor, lighted by a larger and a smaller window to the  side, and provided with a doorway to the court, and one at the  back, opposite to one in the outer wall, through which the  monk may have conveyed the sweepings of his cell and the refuse  of his garden to the ``eremus'' beyond.  By the side of the  door to the court is a little hatch through which the daily  pittance of food was supplied, so contrived by turning at an  angle in the wall that no one could either look in or look  out.  A very perfect example of this hatch---an arrangement  belonging to all Carthusian houses--exists at Miraflores, near  Burgos, which remains nearly as it was completed in 1480.

Wood-house.               FIG. 13--Carthusian cell, Clermont.    There were only nine Carthusian houses in England.  The  earliest was that at Witham in Somersetshire, founded  by Henry II., by whom the order was first brought into  England.  The wealthiest and most magnificent was that of  Sheen or Richmond in Surrey, founded by Henry V. about A.D.  1414.  The, dimensions of the buildings at Sheen are stated  to have been remarkably large.  The great court measured  300 ft. by 250 ft.; the cloisters were a square of 500 ft.;  the hall was 110 ft. in length by 60 ft. in breadth.  The  most celebrated historically is the Charter house of London,  founded by Sir Walter Manny A.D. 1371, the name of which  is preserved by the famous public school established on the  site by Thomas Sutton A.D. 1611, now removed to Godalming.    Mendicant Friars.    An article on monastic arrangements would be incomplete without  some account of the convents of the Mendicant or Preaching  Friars, including the Black Friars or Dominicans, the Grey  or Franciscans, the White or Carmelites, the Eremite or  Austin, Friars.  These orders arose at the beginning of the  13th century, when the Benedictines, together with their  various reformed branches, had terminated their active  mission, and Christian Europe was ready for a new religious  revival.  Planting themselves, as a rule, in large towns,  and by preference in the poorest and most densely populated  districts, the Preaching Friars were obliged to adapt their  buildings to the requirements of the site.  Regularity of  arrangement, therefore, was not possible, even if they had  studied it.  Their churches, built for the reception of  large congregations of hearers rather than worshippers, form  a class by themselves, totally unlike those of the elder  orders in ground-plan and character.  They were usually long  parallelograms unbroken by transepts.  The nave very usually  consisted of two equal bodies, one containing the stalls  of the brotherhood, the other left entirely free for the  congregation.  The constructional choir is often wanting,  the whole church forming one uninterrupted structure, with  a continuous range of windows.  The east end was usually  square, but the Friars Church at Winchelsea had a polygonal  apse.  We not unfrequently find a single transept, sometimes of  great size, rivalling or exceeding the nave.  This arrangement  is frequent in Ireland, where the numerous small friaries  afford admirable exemplifications of these peculiarities of  ground-plan.  The friars' churches were at first destitute of  towers; but in the 14th and 15th centuries, tall, slender towers  were commonly inserted between the nave and the choir.  The  Grey Friars at Lynn, where the tower is hexagonal, is a good  example.  The arrangement of the monastic buildings is equally  peculiar and characteristic.  We miss entirely the regularity  of the buildings of the earlier orders.  At the Jacobins at  Paris, a cloister lay to the north of the long narrow church  of two parallel aisles, while the refectory--a room of immense  length, quite detached from the cloister--stretched across  the area before the west front of the church.  At Toulouse the  nave also has two parallel aisles, but the choir is apsidal,  with radiating chapel.  The refectory stretches northwards at  right angles to the cloister, which lies to the north of the  church, having the chapter-house and sacristy on the east.    Norwich.  Gloucester.    As examples of English friaries, the Dominican house at  Norwich, and those of the Dominicans and Franciscans at  Gloucester, may be mentioned.  The church of the Black  Friars of Norwich departs from the original type in the  nave (now St Andrew's Hall), in having regular aisles.  In  this it resembles the earlier examples of the Grey Friars at  Reading.  The choir is long and aisleless; an hexagonal tower  between the two, like that existing at Lynn, has perished.  Thc  cloister and monastic buildings remain tolerably perfect to the  north.  The Dominican convent at Gloucester still exhibits the  cloister-court, on the north side of which is the desecrated  church.  The refectory is on the west side and on the south  the dormitory of the 13th century.  This is a remarkably good  example.  There were 18 cells or cubicles on each side, divided  by partitions, the bases of which remain.  On the east side  was the prior's house, a building of later date.  At the Grey  or Franciscan Friars, the church followed the ordinary type in  having two equal bodies, each gabled, with a continuous range of  windows.  There was a slender tower between the nave and the choir.    Hulne.    Of the convents of the Carmelite or White Friars we have a  good example in the Abbey of Hulne, near Alnwick, the first  of the order in England, founded A.D. 1240.  The church  is a narrow oblong, destitute of aisles, 123 ft. long by  only 26 ft. wide.  The cloisters are to the south, with  the chapter-house, &c., to the east, with the dormitory  over.  The prior's lodge is placed to the west of the  cloister.  The guest-houses adjoin the entrance gateway, to  which a chapel was annexed on the south side of the conventual  area.  The nave of the church of the Austin Friars or Eremites  in London is still standing.  It is of Decorated date, and  has wide centre and side aisles, divided by a very light and  graceful arcade.  Some fragments of the south walk of the  cloister of the Grey Friars remained among the buildings of  Christ's Hospital (the Blue-Coat School), while they were still  standing.  Of the Black Friars all has perished but the  name.  Taken as a whole, the remains of the establishments of  the friars afford little warrant for the bitter invective of  the Benedictine of St Alban's, Matthew Paris:---``The friars  who have been founded hardly 40 years have built residences  as the palaces of kings.  These are they who, enlarging day  by day their sumptuous edifices, encircling them with lofty  walls, lay up in them their incalculable treasures, imprudently  transgressing the bounds of poverty and violating the very  fundamental rules of their profession.'' Allowance must here be  made for jealousy of a rival order just rising in popularity.    Cells.    Every large monastery had depending upon it one or more smaller  establishments known as cells. These cells were monastic  colonies, sent forth by the parent house, and planted on some  outlying estate.  As an example, we may refer to the small  religious house of St Mary Magdalene's, a cell of the great  Benedictine house of St Mary's, York, in the valley of the  Witham, to the south-east of the city of Lincoln.  This consists  of one long narrow range of building, of which the eastern part  formed the chapel and the western contained the apartments of  the handful of monks of which it was the home.  To the east  may be traced the site of the abbey mill, with its dam and  mill-lead.  These cells, when belonging to a Cluniac house,  were called Obedientiae. The plan given by Viollet-le-Duc  of the Priory of St Jean des Bons Hommes, a Cluniac cell,  situated between the town of Avallon and the village of  Savigny, shows that these diminutive establishments comprised  every essential feature of a monastery,---chapel, cloister,  chapter-room, refectory, dormitory, all grouped according to the  recognized arrangement.  These Cluniac obedientiae differed  from the ordinary Benedictine cells in being also places of  punishment, to which monks who had been guilty of any grave  infringement of the rules were relegated as to a kind of  penitentiary.  Here they were placed under the authority of a"]]]
