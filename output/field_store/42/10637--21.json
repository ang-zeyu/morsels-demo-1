A year  later La Tour {99} also seized the \"trading wigwam\" at Machias, in the  present State of Maine, but not before two of the English occupants  were killed.  La Tour had by this time removed from Cape Sable to the  mouth of the River St. John, where he had built a strong fort on,  probably, Portland Point, on the east side of the harbour of the  present city of St. John, and was engaged in a lucrative trade in furs  until a quarrel broke out between him and D'Aunay.    Soon after Razilly's death in the autumn of 1635, D'Aunay asserted his  right, as lieutenant-governor of Acadia and his late chief's deputy, to  command in the colony.  He obtained from Claude de Razilly, brother of  the governor, all his rights in Acadia, and removed the seat of  government from La Heve to Port Royal, where he built a fort on the  site of the present town of Annapolis.  It was not long before he and  La Tour became bitter enemies.    La Tour considered, with much reason, that he had superior rights on  account of his long services in the province that ought to have been  acknowledged, and that D'Aunay was all the while working to injure him  in France.  D'Aunay had certainly a great advantage over his opponent,  as he had powerful influence at the French Court, while La Tour was not  personally known and was regarded with some suspicion on account of his  father being a Huguenot, and friendly to England.  As a matter of fact,  the younger La Tour was no Protestant, but a luke-warm Catholic, who  considered creed subservient to his personal interests.  This fact  explains why the Capuchin friars always had a good word to say for  {100} his rival who was a zealous Catholic and did much to promote  their mission.    The French Government attempted at first to decide between the two  claimants and settle the dispute, but all in vain.  La Tour made an  attempt in 1640 to surprise D'Aunay at Port Royal, but the result was  that he as well as his bride, who had just come from France, were  themselves taken prisoners.  The Capuchin friars induced D'Aunay to set  them all at liberty on condition that La Tour should keep the peace in  future.  The only result was an aggravation of the difficulty and the  reference of the disputes to France, where D'Aunay won the day both in  the courts and with the royal authorities.  La Tour's commission was  revoked and D'Aunay eventually received an order to seize the property  and person of his rival, when he proved contumacious and refused to  obey the royal command, on the ground that it had been obtained by  false representations.  He retired to his fort on the St. John, where,  with his resolute wife and a number of faithful Frenchmen and Indians,  he set D'Aunay at defiance.  In this crisis La Tour resolved to appeal  to the government of Massachusetts for assistance.  In 1630, the town  of Boston was commenced on the peninsula of Shawmut, and was already a  place of considerable commercial importance.  Harvard College was  already open, schools were established, town meetings were frequent,  and a system of representative government was in existence.  Not only  so, the colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth  had formed themselves into {101} a confederacy \"for preserving and  propagating the truth and liberties of the Gospel, and for their own  mutual safety and welfare.\"    Much sympathy was felt in Boston for La Tour, who was a man of very  pleasing manners, and was believed to be a Huguenot at heart.  He  explained the affair at Machias and his relations with the French  Government to the satisfaction of the Boston people, though apparently  with little regard to truth.  The desire to encourage a man, who  promised to be a good customer of their own, finally prevailed over  their caution, and the cunning Puritans considered they got out of  their quandary by the decision that, though the colony could not  directly contribute assistance, yet it was lawful for private citizens  to charter their vessels, and offer their services as volunteers to  help La Tour.  The New Englanders had not forgotten D'Aunay's action at  Penobscot some years before, and evidently thought he was a more  dangerous man than his rival.    Some Massachusetts merchants, under these circumstances, provided La  Tour with four staunch armed vessels and seventy men, while he on his  part gave them a lien over all his property.  When D'Aunay had tidings  of the expedition in the Bay of Fundy, he raised a blockade of Fort La  Tour and escaped to the westward.  La Tour, assisted by some of the New  England volunteers, destroyed his rival's fortified mill, after a few  lives were lost on either side.  A pinnace, having on board a large  quantity of D'Aunay's furs, was captured, and the {102} booty divided  between the Massachusetts men and La Tour.    From his wife, then in France, where she had gone to plead his cause,  La Tour received the unwelcome news that his enemy was on his return to  Acadia with an overwhelming force.  Thereupon he presented himself  again in Boston, and appealed to the authorities for further  assistance, but they would not do more than send a remonstrance to  D'Aunay and ask explanations of his conduct.    At this critical moment, La Tour's wife appeared on the scene.  Unable  to do anything in France for her husband, she had found her way to  London, where she took passage on a vessel bound for Boston; but the  master, instead of carrying her directly to Fort La Tour, as he had  agreed, spent some months trading in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on  the coast of Nova Scotia.  D'Aunay was cruising off Cape Sable, in the  hope of intercepting her, and searched the vessel, but Madame La Tour  was safely concealed in the hold, and the vessel was allowed to go on  to Boston.  On her arrival there, Madame La Tour brought an action  against the master and consignee for a breach of contract, and  succeeded in obtaining a judgment in her favour for two thousand  pounds.  When she found it impossible to come to a settlement, she  seized the goods in the ship, and on this security hired three vessels  and sailed to rejoin her husband.  In the meantime an envoy from  D'Aunay, a Monsieur Marie, always supposed to be a Capuchin friar,  presented himself to the Massachusetts authorities, and after making a  strong {103} remonstrance against the course heretofore pursued by the  colony, proffered terms of amity in the future on the condition that no  further aid was given to La Tour.  After some consideration the  colonial government, of which Governor Endicott was now the head,  agreed to a treaty of friendship, which was not ratified by D'Aunay for  some time afterwards, when La Tour was a fugitive.  Then the terms were  sanctioned by the commissioners of the confederated colonies.    Having succeeded in obtaining the neutrality of the English colonists  through his agent Marie, D'Aunay then determined to attack La Tour's  fort on the St. John, as he had now under his control a sufficient  number of men and ships.  In the spring of the same year, however, when  La Tour was absent, D'Aunay mustered all his vessels and men, and laid  siege to the fort, but he met with most determined resistance from the  garrison, nerved and stimulated by the voice and example of the heroic  wife.  The besiegers were almost disheartened, when a traitor within  the walls--a \"mercenary Swiss,\" according to a contemporary  writer--gave them information which determined them to renew the  assault with still greater vigour.  D'Aunay and his men again attempted  to scale the walls, but were forced to retire with a considerable  force.  Then D'Aunay offered fair terms if the fort was immediately  given up.  Madame La Tour, anxious to spare the lives of her brave  garrison, which was rapidly thinning, agreed to the proposal, and  surrendered the fort; and then D'Aunay is said to have broken {104} his  solemn pledge, and hanged all the defenders except one, whose life was  spared on the condition of his acting as executioner.    One would fain not believe what the contemporary historian adds, that  D'Aunay forced Madame La Tour to remain with a rope round her own neck,  and witness the execution of the brave men who had so nobly assisted  her in defending the fort.  The poor lady did not long survive this  tragedy, as she died a prisoner a few weeks later.  All the acts of her  adventurous and tragic career prove her to have been a good woman and a  courageous wife, and may well be an inspiring theme for poetry and  romance.[2]    D'Aunay now reigned supreme in Acadia.  He had burdened himself heavily  with debt in his efforts to ruin his rival, but he had some  compensation in {105} the booty he found at St. John.  By the capture  of his fort La Tour lost jewels, plate, furniture, and goods valued at  ten thousand pounds, and was for a time a bankrupt.  His debts in  Boston were very heavy, and Major Gibbons, who had sent vessels to Fort  La Tour in 1643, was never able to recover the mortgage he had taken on  his estate.  Bereft of wife and possessions, La Tour left Acadia and  sought aid from Sir David Kirk, who was then governor of Newfoundland,  but to no purpose.  Various stories are told of his career for two  years or longer, and it is even reported that he robbed a Boston vessel  in his necessities, \"whereby it appeared, as the Scripture saith,\"  mournfully exclaims Governor Winthrop, \"that there is no confidence in  any unfaithful or carnal man.\"  Boston merchants and sailors had  suffered a good deal from both D'Aunay and La Tour, and such a story  would naturally obtain credence among men who found they had made a bad  investment in Fort La Tour and its appendages.  D'Aunay continued his  work of improving Port Royal and surrounding country, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22566"],[0,"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#17)"],[1,"mind,\" said Zeb, \"we don't want to get back, anyhow.\"    \"I'm not so sure of that,\" returned Dorothy. \"The mother dragon may come  down and catch us here.\"    \"It is possible,\" agreed the Wizard, \"if this proves to be the path she  usually takes. But I have been examining this tunnel, and I do not see  any signs of so large a beast having passed through it.\"    \"Then we're all right,\" said the girl, \"for if the dragon went the other  way she can't poss'bly get to us now.\"    \"Of course not, my dear. But there is another thing to consider. The  mother dragon probably knows the road to the earth's surface, and if she  went the other way then we have come the wrong way,\" said the Wizard,  thoughtfully.    \"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy. \"That would be unlucky, wouldn't it?\"    \"Very. Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth,\" said  Zeb. \"For my part, if we manage to get out of here I'll be glad it isn't  the way the dragon goes.\"    \"So will I,\" returned Dorothy. \"It's enough to have your pedigree flung  in your face by those saucy dragonettes. No one knows what the mother  might do.\"    They now moved on again, creeping slowly up another steep incline. The  lanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the remaining  oil from one into the other, so that the one light would last longer.  But their journey was almost over, for in a short time they reached a  small cave from which there was no further outlet.    They did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts were  gladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crack  in the roof of the cave, far overhead. That meant that their world--the  real world--was not very far away, and that the succession of perilous  adventures they had encountered had at last brought them near the  earth's surface, which meant home to them. But when the adventurers  looked more carefully around them they discovered that they were in a  strong prison from which there was no hope of escape.    \"But we're _almost_ on earth again,\" cried Dorothy, \"for there is the  sun--the most _beau'ful_ sun that shines!\" and she pointed eagerly at  the crack in the distant roof.    \"Almost on earth isn't being there,\" said the kitten, in a discontented  tone. \"It wouldn't be possible for even me to get up to that crack--or  through it if I got there.\"    \"It appears that the path ends here,\" announced the Wizard, gloomily.    \"And there is no way to go back,\" added Zeb, with a low whistle of  perplexity.    \"I was sure it would come to this, in the end,\" remarked the old  cab-horse. \"Folks don't fall into the middle of the earth and then get  back again to tell of their adventures--not in real life. And the whole  thing has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to talk  your language, and to understand the words you say.\"    \"And so can the nine tiny piglets,\" added Eureka. \"Don't forget them,  for I may have to eat them, after all.\"    \"I've heard animals talk before,\" said Dorothy, \"and no harm came of  it.\"    \"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with no  way of getting out?\" enquired the horse, seriously.    \"No,\" answered Dorothy. \"But don't you lose heart, Jim, for I'm sure  this isn't the end of our story, by any means.\"    The reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had not  enjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in his  pocket. So he sat down upon the floor of the cave, brought the piglets  out one by one, and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased.    \"My dears,\" he said to them, \"I'm afraid I've got you into a lot of  trouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy  cave.\"    \"What's wrong?\" asked a piglet. \"We've been in the dark quite a while,  and you may as well explain what has happened.\"    The Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers.    \"Well,\" said another piglet, \"you are a wizard, are you not?\"    \"I am,\" replied the little man.    \"Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole,\" declared the  tiny one, with much confidence.    \"I could if I happened to be a real wizard,\" returned the master sadly.  \"But I'm not, my piggy-wees; I'm a humbug wizard.\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried several of the piglets, together.    \"You can ask Dorothy,\" said the little man, in an injured tone.    \"It's true enough,\" returned the girl, earnestly. \"Our friend Oz is  merely a humbug wizard, for he once proved it to me. He can do several  very wonderful things--if he knows how. But he can't wiz a single thing  if he hasn't the tools and machinery to work with.\"    \"Thank you, my dear, for doing me justice,\" responded the Wizard,  gratefully. \"To be accused of being a real wizard, when I'm not, is a  slander I will not tamely submit to. But I am one of the greatest humbug  wizards that ever lived, and you will realize this when we have all  starved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of this  lonely cave.\"    \"I don't believe we'll realize anything, when it comes to that,\"  remarked Dorothy, who had been deep in thought. \"But I'm not going to  scatter my bones just yet, because I need them, and you prob'ly need  yours, too.\"    \"We are helpless to escape,\" sighed the Wizard.    \"_We_ may be helpless,\" answered Dorothy, smiling at him, \"but there are  others who can do more than we can. Cheer up, friends. I'm sure Ozma  will help us.\"    \"Ozma!\" exclaimed the Wizard. \"Who is Ozma?\"    \"The girl that rules the marvelous Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"She's a  friend of mine, for I met her in the Land of Ev, not long ago, and went  to Oz with her.\"    \"For the second time?\" asked the Wizard, with great interest.    \"Yes. The first time I went to Oz I found you there, ruling the Emerald  City. After you went up in a balloon, and escaped us, I got back to  Kansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes.\"    \"I remember those shoes,\" said the little man, nodding. \"They once  belonged to the Wicked Witch. Have you them here with you?\"    \"No; I lost them somewhere in the air,\" explained the child. \"But the  second time I went to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King's Magic Belt,  which is much more powerful than were the Silver Shoes.\"    \"Where is that Magic Belt?\" enquired the Wizard, who had listened with  great interest.    \"Ozma has it; for its powers won't work in a common, ordinary country  like the United States. Anyone in a fairy country like the Land of Oz  can do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma,  who used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry.\"    \"And were you?\" asked Zeb, astonished at what he heard.    \"Of course; in just a jiffy. And Ozma has an enchanted picture hanging  in her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends may  be, at any time she chooses. All she has to do is to say: 'I wonder what  So-and-so is doing,' and at once the picture shows where her friend is  and what the friend is doing. That's _real_ magic, Mr. Wizard; isn't it?  Well, every day at four o'clock Ozma has promised to look at me in that  picture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a certain sign and  she will put on the Nome King's Magic Belt and wish me to be with her in  Oz.\"    \"Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchanted  picture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?\" demanded Zeb.    \"Of course; when it is four o'clock,\" she replied, with a laugh at his  startled expression.    \"And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?\"  continued the boy.    \"That's it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt.\"    \"Then,\" said the Wizard, \"you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I am  very glad of it. The rest of us will die much more cheerfully when we  know you have escaped our sad fate.\"    \"_I_ won't die cheerfully!\" protested the kitten. \"There's nothing  cheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat has  nine lives, and so must die nine times.\"    \"Have you ever died yet?\" enquired the boy.    \"No, and I'm not anxious to begin,\" said Eureka.    \"Don't worry, dear,\" Dorothy exclaimed, \"I'll hold you in my arms, and  take you with me.\"    \"Take us, too!\" cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath.    \"Perhaps I can,\" answered Dorothy. \"I'll try.\"    \"Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?\" asked the cab-horse.    Dorothy laughed.    \"I'll do better than that,\" she promised, \"for I can easily save you  all, once I am myself in the Land of Oz.\"    \"How?\" they asked.    \"By using the Magic Belt. All I need do is to wish you with me, and  there you'll be--safe in the royal palace!\"    \"Good!\" cried Zeb.    \"I built that palace, and the Emerald City, too,\" remarked the Wizard,  in a thoughtful tone, \"and I'd like to see them again, for I was very  happy among the Munchkins and Winkies and Quadlings and Gillikins.\"    \"Who are they?\" asked the boy.    \"The four nations that inhabit the Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"I wonder  if they would treat me nicely if I went there again.\"    \"Of course they would!\" declared Dorothy. \"They are still proud of their  former Wizard, and often speak of you kindly.\"    \"Do you happen to know whatever became of the Tin Woodman and the  Scarecrow?\" he enquired.    \"They live in Oz yet,\" said the girl, \"and are very important people.\"    \"And the Cowardly Lion?\"    \"Oh, he lives there too, with his friend the Hungry Tiger; and Billina  is there, because she liked the place better than Kansas, and wouldn't  go with me to Australia.\"    \"I'm afraid I don't know the Hungry Tiger and Billina,\" said the Wizard,  shaking his head. \"Is Billina a girl?\"    \"No; she's a yellow hen, and a great friend of mine. You're sure to like  Billina, when you know her,\" asserted Dorothy.    \"Your friends sound like a menagerie,\" remarked Zeb, uneasily.  \"Couldn't you wish me in some safer place than Oz.\"    \"Don't worry,\" replied the girl. \"You'll just "]]]
