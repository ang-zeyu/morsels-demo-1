Byron's predilection for the       unbounded could not have been nearly so dangerous with more       humble birth and smaller means. But as it was, he was able to       put every fancy into practice, and this involved him in       innumerable scrapes. Besides, how could one of such high rank       be inspired with awe and respect by any rank whatever? He spoke       out whatever he felt, and this brought him into ceaseless       conflict with the world. It is surprising to remark,' continued       Goethe, 'how large a portion of the life of a rich Englishman       of rank is passed in duels and elopements. Lord Byron himself       says, that his father carried off three ladies. And let any man       be a steady son after that. Properly speaking, he lived       perpetually in a state of nature, and with his mode of       existence the necessity for self-defence floated daily before       his eyes. Hence his constant pistol-shooting. Every moment he       expected to be called out. He could not live alone. Hence, with       all his oddities, he was very indulgent to his associates. He       one evening read his fine poem on the Death of Sir John Moore,       and his noble friends did not know what to make of it. This did       not move him, but he put it away again. As a poet, he really       showed himself a lamb. Another would have commended them to the       devil.'\"    Yet Goethe had a curious theory in respect to criticism, and believed it  possible for a foreigner to understand the achievements of a language  not his own better than those to whom it is native--in which we think he  was partially correct. In the following he criticises CARLYLE.         \"'Sit down,' said he, 'and let us talk awhile. A new       translation of Sophocles has just arrived. It reads well, and       seems to be excellent; I will compare it with Solgar. Now, what       say you to Carlyle?' I told him what I had been reading upon       Fonque. 'Is not that very good?' said Goethe. 'Aye, there are       clever people over the sea, who know us and can appreciate       us?... We are weakest in the aesthetic department, and may wait       long before we meet such a man as Carlyle. It is pleasant to       see that intercourse is now so close between the French,       English, and Germans, that we shall be able to correct one       another. This is the greatest use of a world-literature, which       will show itself more and more. Carlyle has written a life of       Schiller, and judged him as it would be difficult for a German       to judge him. On the other hand, we are clear about Shakspeare       and Byron, and can, perhaps, appreciate their merits better       than the English themselves.\"    Carlyle is frequently referred to, and always thus. The clear-sighted,  great old man, already perceives how much his fame will owe to such an  apostle and preacher of his faith--for he sees also what Carlyle himself  will become. The mention of Lockhart is also very interesting.         \"I asked about Lockhart, and whether he still recollected him.       'Perfectly well!' returned Goethe. 'His personal appearance       makes so decided an impression that one cannot easily forget       him. From all I hear from Englishmen, and from my       daughter-in-law, he must be a young man from whom great things       in literature are to be expected. I almost wonder that Walter       Scott does not say a word about Carlyle, who has so decided a       German tendency that he must certainly be known to him. It is       admirable in Carlyle that, in his judgment of our German       authors, he has especially in view the mental and moral core       as that which is really influential. Carlyle is a moral force       of great importance. There is in him much for the future, and       we cannot foresee what he will produce and effect.'\"    Again:         \"'It is pleasant to see,' said Goethe, 'how the earlier       pedantry of the Scotch has changed into earnestness and       profundity. When I recollect how the 'Edinburgh Reviewers'       treated my works not many years since, and when I now consider       Carlyle's merits with respect to German literature, I am       astonished at the important step for the better. In Carlyle,'       said he, 'I venerate most of all the mind and the character       which lie at the foundation of his tendencies. The chief point       with him is the culture of his own nation; and, in the literary       productions of other countries, which he wishes to make known       to his contemporaries, he pays less attention to the arts of       talent, than to the moral elevation which can be attained       through such works. Yes,' said Goethe, 'the temper in which he       works is always admirable. What an earnest man he is! and how       he has studied us Germans! He is always more at home in our       literature than ourselves. At any rate we cannot vie with him       in our researches in English literature.'\"          MR. KELLOGG'S EXPLORATION OF MT. SINAI.      The last volume of _Bohn's Illustrated Library_ (published in New-York  by Bangs & Brother), is \"Scripture Lands, Described in a Series of  Historical, Geographical, and Topographical Sketches,\" by JOHN KITTO,  D.D., F.S.A., the well-known author of the Dictionary of the Bible, &c.  It embraces, in a convenient and condensed form, results of the most  important recent investigations by travellers and scholars in the  countries sacred for their connection with the history of true religion.  With other things by Americans, Dr. Kitto gives a prominent place to Mr.  MINER K. KELLOGG'S account of Mt. Sinai, which we reprint below; and we  cannot let the opportunity pass unimproved, of expressing a hope that  Mr. Kellogg will prepare for the press the voluminous notes which we  know him to possess of his various and interesting travels in the  ancient world, which he saw with the eye of an artist, the head of a  scholar, and the heart of a Christian. If he would, he might give us a  most delightful and instructive book upon the East, and one that would  be eminently popular, though Asia has been of all the continents the  most frequently described. Dr. Kitto says:    \"At the foot of the pass which leads up to the sacred shrine beneath the  awful mount, from whose summit Jehovah proclaimed his law to the  trembling hosts of Israel, Dr. Robinson says,--'We commenced the slow  and toilsome ascent along the narrow defile, about south by east,  between blackened, shattered cliffs of granite, some eight hundred feet  high, and not more than two hundred and fifty yards apart, which every  moment threatened to send down their ruins on our heads. Nor is this at  all times an empty threat; for the whole pass is filled with large  stones and rocks, the _debris_ of these cliffs. The bottom is a deep and  narrow water-course, where the wintry torrent sweeps down with fearful  violence. A path has been made for camels, along the shelving rocks,  partly by removing the topmost blocks, sometimes in the manner of a  Swiss mountain-road. But though I had crossed the most rugged passes of  the Alps, and made from Chamouni the whole circuit of Mont Blanc, I had  never found a path so rude and difficult as that we were now ascending.'    \"After toiling along for nearly two hours, our travellers continue their  narrative:    \"'Here the interior and lofty peaks of the great circle of Sinai began  to open upon us--black, rugged, desolate summits; and, as we advanced,  the dark and frowning front of Sinai itself (the present Horeb of the  monks) began to appear. We were gradually ascending, and the valley  gradually opening; but as yet all was a naked desert. Afterwards, a few  shrubs were sprinkled round about, and a small encampment of black tents  was seen on our right, with camels and goats browsing, and a few donkeys  belonging to the convent. The scenery through which we had now passed  reminded me strongly of the mountains around the Mer de Glace in  Switzerland. I had never seen a spot more wild and desolate.    \"'As we advanced, the valley still opened wider and wider with a gentle  ascent, and became full of shrubs and tufts of herbs, shut in on each  side by lofty granite ridges, and rugged, shattered peaks, a thousand  feet high, while the face of Horeb rose directly before us. Both my  companion and myself involuntarily exclaimed, \"here is room enough for a  large encampment!\"    \"'Reaching the top of the ascent or watershed, a fine broad plain lay  before us, sloping down gently towards the south-south-east, inclosed by  rugged and venerable mountains of dark granite, stern, naked, splintered  peaks, and ridges of indescribable grandeur; and terminated, at a  distance of more than a mile, by the bold and awful front of Horeb,  rising perpendicularly in frowning majesty, from twelve to fifteen  hundred feet in height. It was a scene of solemn grandeur, wholly  unexpected, and such as we had never seen; and the associations which at  the moment rushed upon our minds were almost overwhelming.'    \"They subsequently ascended the frowning summit of Horeb, and sketched  the scene from that point:--'The whole plain, er-Rahah, lay spread out  beneath our feet, with the adjacent wadys and mountains; while Wady  esh-Sheikh on the right, and the recess on the left, both connected with  and opening broadly from er-Rahah, presented an area which serves nearly  to double that of the plain.    \"'Our conviction was strengthened that here, or on some of the adjacent  cliffs, was the spot where the Lord \"descended in fire,\" and proclaimed  the law. Here lay the plain where the whole congregation might be  assembled; here was the mount that could be approached, if not  forbidden; and here the mountain brow, where alone the lightning and the  thick cloud would be visible, and the thunders and the voice of the  trump be heard, when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24923"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Vol. I. (#17)"],[1,"characters closely resembles that of the short-eared  Chinese breed of the _S. Indica_ type. Hence Nathusius considers the Japan  pig as only a domesticated variety of _S. Indica_: if this really be the  case, it is a wonderful instance of the amount of modification which can be  effected under domestication.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--Head of Japan or Masked Pig. (Copied from Mr.  Bartlett's paper in Proc. Zoolog. Soc. 1861, p. 263.)]    Formerly there existed in the central islands of the Pacific Ocean a  singular breed of pigs. These are described by the Rev. D. Tyerman and G.  Bennett[156] as of small size, hump-backed, with a disproportionately long  head, with short ears turned backwards, with a bushy tail not more than two  inches in length, placed as if it grew from the back. Within half a century  after the introduction into these islands of European and Chinese pigs, the  native breed, according to the above authors, became almost completely lost  by being repeatedly crossed with them. Secluded islands, as might have been  expected, seem favourable for the production or retention of peculiar  breeds; thus, in the Orkney Islands, the hogs have been described as very  small, with erect and sharp ears, and \"with an appearance altogether  different from the hogs brought from the south.\"[157]    Seeing how different the Chinese pigs, belonging to the _Sus Indica_ type,  are in their osteological characters and in external {71} appearance from  the pigs of the _S. scrofa_ type, so that they must be considered  specifically distinct, it is a fact well deserving attention, that Chinese  and common pigs have been repeatedly crossed in various manners, with  unimpaired fertility. One great breeder who had used pure Chinese pigs  assured me that the fertility of the half-breeds _inter se_ and of their  recrossed progeny was actually increased; and this is the general belief of  agriculturists. Again, the Japan pig or _S. pliciceps_ of Gray is so  distinct in appearance from all common pigs, that it stretches one's belief  to the utmost to admit that it is simply a domestic variety; yet this breed  has been found perfectly fertile with the Berkshire breed; and Mr. Eyton  informs me that he paired a half-bred brother and sister and found them  quite fertile together.    The modifications of the skull in the most highly cultivated races are  wonderful. To appreciate the amount of change, Nathusius' work, with its  excellent figures, should be studied. The whole of the exterior of the  skull in all its parts has been altered; the hinder surface, instead of  sloping backwards, is directed forwards, entailing many changes in other  parts; the front of the head is deeply concave; the orbits have a different  shape; the auditory meatus has a different direction and shape; the  incisors of the upper and lower jaws do not touch each other, and they  stand in both jaws above the plane of the molars; the canines of the upper  jaw stand in front of those of the lower jaw, and this is a remarkable  anomaly: the articular surfaces of the occipital condyles are so greatly  changed in shape, that, as Nathusius remarks (s. 133), no naturalist,  seeing this important part of the skull by itself, would suppose that it  belonged to the genus Sus. These and various other modifications, as  Nathusius observes, can hardly be considered as monstrosities, for they are  not injurious, and are strictly inherited. The whole head is much  shortened; thus, whilst in common breeds its length to that of the body is  as 1 to 6, in the \"cultur-races\" the proportion is as 1 to 9, and even  recently as 1 to 11.[158] The following woodcut[159] {72} of the head of a  wild boar and of a sow from a photograph of the Yorkshire Large Breed, may  aid in showing how greatly the head in a highly cultivated race has been  modified and shortened.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Head of Wild Boar, and of \"Golden Days,\" a pig of  the Yorkshire Large Breed; the latter from a photograph. (Copied from  Sidney's edit. of 'The Pig,' by Youatt.)]    Nathusius has well discussed the causes of the remarkable changes in the  skull and shape of the body which the highly cultivated races have  undergone. These modifications occur chiefly in the pure and crossed races  of the _S. Indica_ type; but their commencement may be clearly detected in  the slightly improved breeds of the _S. scrofa_ type.[160] Nathusius states  positively (s. 99, 103), as the result of common experience and of his  experiments, that rich and abundant food, given during youth, tends by some  direct action to make the head broader and shorter; and that poor food  works a contrary result. He lays much stress on the fact that all wild and  semi-domesticated pigs, in ploughing up the ground with their muzzles,  have; whilst young, to exert the powerful muscles fixed to the hinder part  of the head. In highly cultivated races this habit is no longer followed,  and consequently the back of the skull becomes modified in shape, entailing  other changes in other parts. There can hardly be a doubt that so great a  change in habits would {73} affect the skull; but it seems rather doubtful  how far this will account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and  for its concave front. It is well known (Nathusius himself advancing many  cases, s. 104) that there is a strong tendency in many domestic animals--in  bull- and pug-dogs, in the niata cattle, in sheep, in Polish fowls,  short-faced tumbler pigeons, and in one variety of the carp--for the bones  of the face to become greatly shortened. In the case of the dog, as H.  Mueller has shown, this seems caused by an abnormal state of the primordial  cartilage. We may, however, readily admit that abundant and rich food  supplied during many generations would give an inherited tendency to  increased size of body, and that, from disuse, the limbs would become finer  and shorter.[161] We shall in a future chapter also see that the skull and  limbs are apparently in some manner correlated, so that any change in the  one tends to affect the other.    Nathusius has remarked, and the observation is an interesting one, that the  peculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly cultivated races is  not characteristic of any one race, but is common to all when improved up  to the same standard. Thus the large-bodied, long-eared, English breeds  with a convex back, and the small-bodied, short-eared, Chinese breeds with  a concave back, when bred to the same state of perfection, nearly resemble  each other in the form of the head and body. This result, it appears, is  partly due to similar causes of change acting on the several races, and  partly to man breeding the pig for one sole purpose, namely, for the  greatest amount of flesh and fat; so that selection has always tended  towards one and the same end. With most domestic animals the result of  selection has been divergence of character, here it has been  convergence.[162]    The nature of the food supplied during many generations has apparently  affected the length of the intestines; for, according to Cuvier,[163] their  length to that of the body in the wild boar is as 9 to 1,--in the common  domestic boar as 13.5 to 1,--and in the Siam breed as 16 to 1. In this  latter breed the greater {74} length may be due either to descent from a  distinct species or to more ancient domestication. The number of mammae  vary, as does the period of gestation. The latest authority says[164] that  \"the period averages from 17 to 20 weeks,\" but I think there must be some  error in this statement: in M. Tessier's observations on 25 sows it varied  from 109 to 123 days. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me ten carefully  recorded cases with well-bred pigs, in which the period varied from 101 to  116 days. According to Nathusius the period is shortest in the races which  come early to maturity; but in these latter the course of development does  not appear to be actually shortened, for the young animal is born, judging  from the state of the skull, less fully developed, or in a more embryonic  condition,[165] than in the case of common swine, which arrive at maturity  at a later age. In the highly cultivated and early matured races, the  teeth, also, are developed earlier.    The difference in the number of the vertebrae and ribs in different kinds of  pigs, as observed by Mr. Eyton,[166] and as given in the following table,  has often been quoted. The African sow probably belongs to the _S. scrofa_  type; and Mr. Eyton informs me that, since the publication of his paper,  cross-bred animals from the African and English races were found by Lord  Hill to be perfectly fertile.      ----------------+--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------                    | English|         |         |             | French                    |  Long- |         |         |             | Domestic                    | legged | African | Chinese | Wild Boar,  | Boar, from                    |  Male. | Female. | Male.   | from Cuvier.| Cuvier.    ----------------+--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------    Dorsal          |        |         |         |             |    vertebrae        |  15    |    13   |   15    |     14      |    14                    |        |         |         |             |    Lumbar          |   6    |     6   |    4    |      5      |     5                    +--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------    Dorsal and      |        |         |         |             |    lumbar together |  21    |    19   |   19    |     19      |    19                    |        |         |         |             |    Sacral          |   5    |     5   |    4    |      4      |     4                    +--------+---------+---------+-------------+-----------    Total number    |        |         |         |             |    of vertebrae     |  26    |    24   |   23    |     23      |    23    --------------"]]]
