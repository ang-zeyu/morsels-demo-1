NOMADS AND SETTLERS.--THE FOUR STAGES OF CULTURE.      1. Men, whatever their pursuit or business, can live only in one of two  ways: they can stay where they are, or they can go from one place to  another. In the present state of the world, we generally do a little of  both. There is some place--city, village, or farm--where we have our  home and our work. But from time to time we go to other places, on  visits or on business, or travel for a certain length of time to great  distances and many places, for instruction and pleasure. Still, there is  usually some place which we think of as home and to which we return.  Wandering or roving is not our natural or permanent condition. But there  are races for whom it is. The Bedouin Arabs are the principal and best  known of such races. Who has not read with delight accounts of their  wild life in the deserts of Arabia and Northern Africa, so full of  adventure and romance,--of their wonderful, priceless horses who are to  them as their own children,--of their noble qualities, bravery,  hospitality, generosity, so strangely blended with love of booty and a  passion for robbing expeditions? They are indeed a noble race, and it is  not their choice, but their country which has made them robbers and  rovers--Nomads, as such wandering races are called in history and  geography. They cannot build cities on the sand of the desert, and the  small patches of pasture and palm groves, kept fresh and green by  solitary springs and called \"oases,\" are too far apart, too distant from  permanently peopled regions to admit of comfortable settlement. In the  south of Arabia and along the sea-shore, where the land is fertile and  inviting, they live much as other nations do, and when, a thousand years  ago, Arabs conquered vast and wealthy countries both in Europe and Asia,  and in Africa too, they not only became model husbandmen, but built some  of the finest cities in the world, had wise and strictly enforced laws  and took the lead in literature and science. Very different are the  scattered nomadic tribes which still roam the steppes of Eastern Russia,  of Siberia and Central Asia. They are not as gifted by far as the Arabs,  yet would probably quickly settle down to farming, were it not that  their wealth consists in flocks of sheep and studs of horses, which  require the pasture yielded so abundantly by the grassy steppes, and  with which they have to move from one place, when it is browsed bare, to  another, and still another, carrying their felt-tents and simple  utensils with them, living on the milk of their mares and the meat of  their sheep. The Red Indian tribes of the far West present still another  aspect of nomadic life--that of the hunter, fierce and entirely untamed,  the simplest and wildest of all.    2. On the whole, however, nomadic life is at the present day the  exception. Most of the nations that are not savages live in houses, not  in portable tents, in cities, not encampments, and form compact, solidly  bound communities, not loose sets of tribes, now friendly, now hostile  to one another. But it has not always been so. There have been times  when settled life was the exception and nomadic life the rule. And the  older the times, the fewer were the permanent communities, the more  numerous the roving tribes. For wandering in search of better places  must have been among the first impulses of intelligent humanity. Even  when men had no shelter but caves, no pursuit but hunting the animals,  whose flesh was their food and in whose skins they clothed themselves,  they must frequently have gone forth, in families or detachments, either  to escape from a neighborhood too much infested with the gigantic wild  beasts which at one time peopled the earth more thickly than men, or  simply because the numbers of the original cave-dwellers had become too  great for the cave to hold them. The latter must have been a very usual  occurrence: families stayed together until they had no longer room  enough, or quarrelled, when they separated. Those who went never saw  again the place and kindred they left, although they carried with them  memories of both, the few simple arts they had learned there and the  customs in which they had been trained. They would stop at some  congenial halting-place, when, after a time, the same process would be  repeated--and so again and again.    3. How was the first horse conquered, the first wild-dog tamed and  conciliated? How were cattle first enticed to give man their milk, to  depend on his care and follow his movements? Who shall tell? However  that may have happened, it is certain that the transition from a  hunter's wild, irregular and almost necessarily lawless existence to the  gentler pursuits of pastoral life must have been attended by a great  change in manners and character. The feeling of ownership too, one of  the principal promoters of a well-regulated state of society, must have  quickly developed with the possession of rapidly increasing wealth in  sheep and horses,--the principal property of nomadic races. But it was  not a kind of property which encouraged to settling, or uniting in close  communities; quite the contrary. Large flocks need vast pasture-grounds.  Besides, it is desirable to keep them apart in order to avoid confusion  and disputes about wells and springs, those rare treasures of the  steppes, which are liable to exhaustion or drying up, and which,  therefore, one flock-owner is not likely to share with another, though  that other were of his own race and kin. The Book of Genesis, which  gives us so faithful and lively a picture of this nomadic pastoral life  of ancient nations, in the account of the wanderings of Abraham and the  other Hebrew patriarchs, has preserved such an incident in the quarrel  between the herdsmen of Abraham and his nephew Lot, which led to their  separation. This is what Abraham said to Lot: \"Is not the whole land  before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take  the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the  right hand, then I will go to the left.\"[Y] So also it is said of Esau  that he \"went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob: for  their riches were more than they might dwell together, and the land  wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their  cattle.\"[Z] This was a facility offered by those immense plains,  unclaimed as yet by any one people in particular, and which must  oft-times have averted strife and bloodshed, but which ceased from the  moment that some one tribe, tired of wandering or tempted by some more  than usually engaging spot, settled down on it, marking that and the  country around it, as far as its power reached, for its own. There is  even now in the East something very similar to this mode of occupation.  In the Turkish Empire, which is, in many places, thinly peopled, there  are large tracts of waste land, sometimes very fertile, accounted as  nobody's property, and acknowledged to belong, legally and forever, to  the first man who takes possession of them, provided he cultivates them.  The government asks no purchase price for the land, but demands taxes  from it as soon as it has found an owner and begins to yield crops.    4. The pastoral nomad's life is, like the hunter's, a singularly free  one,--free both from restraint, and, comparatively, from toil. For  watching and tending flocks is not a laborious occupation, and no  authority can always reach or weigh very heavily on people who are here  to-day and elsewhere to-morrow. Therefore, it is only with the third  stage of human existence, the agricultural one, that civilization, which  cannot subsist without permanent homes and authority, really commences.  The farmer's homestead is the beginning of the State, as the hearth or  fireplace was the beginning of the family. The different labors of the  fields, the house, and the dairy require a great number of hands and a  well-regulated distribution of the work, and so keep several generations  of the settler's family together, on the same farm. Life in common makes  it absolutely necessary to have a set of simple rules for home  government, to prevent disputes, keep up order and harmony, and settle  questions of mutual rights and duties. Who should set down and enforce  these rules but the head of the family, the founder of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#17)"],[1,"(1580). Beze and Viret, together with  their leader Calvin, were eminent in pulpit exposition and  exhortation, and in Beze the preacher was conjoined with a poet. At  Calvin's request he undertook his translation of the Psalms, to  complete that by Marot, and in 1551 his sacred drama the _Tragedie  Francaise du sacrifice d'Abraham_, designed to inculcate the duty  of entire surrender to the divine will, and written with a grave and  restrained ardour, was presented at the University of Lausanne.          CHAPTER II  FROM THE PLEIADE TO MONTAIGNE      The classical Renaissance was not necessarily opposed to high ethical  ideals; it was not wholly an affair of the sensuous imagination; it  brought with it the conception of Roman virtue, and this might well  unite itself (as we see afterwards in Corneille) with Christian faith.  Among the many translators of the sixteenth century was Montaigne's  early friend--the friend in memory of all his life--ETIENNE DE LA  BOETIE (1530-63). It is not, however, for his fragments of Plutarch  or his graceful rendering of Xenophon's Economics (named by him the  _Mesnagerie_) that we remember La Boetie; it is rather for his  eloquent pleading on behalf of freedom in the _Discours de la  Servitude Volontaire_ or _Contr'un_, written at sixteen--revised  later--in which, with the rhetoric of youth, he utters his invective  against tyranny. Before La Boetie's premature death the morals of  antiquity as seen in action had been exhibited to French readers in  the pages of Amyot's delightful translation of Plutarch's Lives  (1559), to be followed, some years later, by his _OEuvres Morales  de Plutarque_. JACQUES AMYOT (1513-93), from an ill-fed, ragged boy,  rose to be the Bishop of Auxerre. His scholarship, seen not only in  his Plutarch, but in his rendering of the _Daphnis et Chloe_ of Longus,  and other works, was exquisite; but still more admirable was his sense  of the capacities of French prose. He divined with a rare instinct  the genius of the language; he felt the affinities between his Greek  original and the idioms of his own countrymen; he rather re-created  than translated Plutarch. \"We dunces,\" wrote Montaigne, \"would have  been lost, had not this book raised us from the mire; thanks to it,  we now venture to speak and write; ... it is our breviary.\" The life  and the ideas of the ancient world became the possession, not of  scholars only, but of all French readers. The book was a school of  manners and of thought, an inspirer of heroic deeds. \"To love  Plutarch,\" said the greatest Frenchman of the century, Henry of  Navarre, \"is to love me, for he was long the master of my youth.\"    It was such an interest in the life and ideas of antiquity as Amyot  conveyed to the general mind of France that was wanting to Ronsard  and the group of poets surrounding him. Their work was concerned  primarily with literary form; of the life of the world and general  ideas, apart from form, they took too little heed. The transition  from Marot to Ronsard is to be traced chiefly through the school of  Lyons. In that city of the South, letters flourished side by side  with industry and commerce; Maurice Sceve celebrated his mistress  Delie, \"object of the highest virtue,\" with Petrarchan ingenuities;  and his pupil LOUISE LABE, \"la belle Cordiere,\" sang in her sonnets  of a true passion felt, as she declares, \"en ses os, en son sang,  en son ame.\" The Lyonese poets, though imbued with Platonic ideas,  rather carry on the tradition of Marot than announce the Pleiade.  PIERRE DE RONSARD, born at a chateau a few leagues from Vendome, in  the year 1524, was in the service of the sons of Francis I. as page,  was in Scotland with James V., and later had the prospect of a  distinguished diplomatic career, when deafness, consequent on a  serious malady, closed for him the avenue to public life. He threw  himself ardently into the study of letters; in company with the boy  Antoine de Baif he received lessons from an excellent Hellenist, Jean  Daurat, soon to be principal of the College Coqueret. At the College  a group of students--Ronsard, Baif, Joachim du Bellay, Remi  Belleau--gathered about the master. The \"Brigade\" was formed, which,  by-and-by, with the addition of Jodelle and Pontus de Thyard, and  including Daurat, became the constellation of the Pleiade. The seven  associates read together, translated and imitated the classics; a  common doctrine of art banded them in unity; they thought scorn of  the vulgar ways of popular verse; poetry for them was an arduous and  exquisite toil; its service was a religion. At length, in 1549, they  flung out their manifesto--the _Defense et Illustration de la Langue  Francaise_ by Du Bellay, the most important study in literary  criticism of the century. With this should be considered, as less  important manifestoes, the later _Art Poetique_ of Ronsard, and his  prefaces to the _Franciade_. To formulate principles is not always  to the advantage of a movement in literature; but champions need a  banner, reformers can hardly dispense with a definite creed. Against  the popular conception of the ignorant the Pleiade maintained that  poetry was a high and difficult form of art; against the pedantry  of humanism they maintained that the native tongue of France admitted  of literary art worthy to take its place beside that of Greece or  Rome. The French literary vocabulary, they declared, has excellences  of its own, but it needs to be enriched by technical terms, by words  of local dialects, by prudent adoptions from Greek and Latin, by  judicious developments of the existing families of words, by the  recovery of words that have fallen into disuse.    It is unjust to the Pleiade to say that they aimed at overloading  poetic diction with neologisms of classical origin; they sought to  innovate with discretion; but they unquestionably aimed at the  formation of a poetic diction distinct from that of prose; they turned  away from simplicity of speech to ingenious periphrasis; they desired  a select, aristocratic idiom for the service of verse; they  recommended a special syntax in imitation of the Latin; for the elder  forms of French poetry they would substitute reproductions or  re-creations of classical forms. Rondeaux, ballades, virelais,  chants royaux, chansons are to be cast aside as _epiceries_; and their  place is to be taken by odes like those of Pindar or of Horace, by  the elegy, satire, epigram, epic, or by newer forms justified by the  practice of Italian masters. Rich but not over-curious rhymes are  to be cultivated, with in general the alternation of masculine and  feminine rhymes; the caesura is to fall in accordance with the meaning.  Ronsard, more liberal than Du Bellay, permits, on the ground of  classical example, the gliding from couplet to couplet without a pause.  \"The alexandrine holds in our language the place of heroic verse among  the Greeks and Romans\"--in this statement is indicated the chief  service rendered to French poetry by Ronsard and the rest of the  Pleiade; they it was who, by their teaching and example, imposed on  later writers that majestic line, possessing the most varied powers,  capable of the finest achievements, which has yielded itself alike  to the purposes of Racine and to those of Victor Hugo.    Ronsard and Du Bellay broke with the tradition of the Middle Ages,  and inaugurated the French classical school; it remained for Malherbe,  at a later date, to reform the reformation of the Pleiade, and to  win for himself the glory which properly belongs to his predecessors.  Unfortunately from its origin the French classical school had in it  the spirit of an intellectual aristocracy, which removed it from  popular sympathies; unfortunately, also, the poets of the Pleiade  failed to perceive that the masterpieces of Greece and Rome are  admirable, not because they belong to antiquity, but because they  are founded on the imitation of nature and on ideas of the reason.  They were regarded as authorities equal with nature or independent  of it; and thus while the school of Ronsard did much to renew literary  art, its teaching involved an error which eventually tended to the  sterilisation of art. That error found its correction in the  literature of the seventeenth century, and expressly in the doctrine  set forth by Boileau; yet under the correction some of the  consequences of the error remained. Ronsard and his followers, on  the other hand, never made the assumption, common enough in the  seventeenth century, that poetry could be manufactured by observance  of the rules, nor did they suppose that the total play of emotion  must be rationalised by the understanding; they left a place for the  instinctive movements of poetic sensibility.    During forty years Ronsard remained the \"Prince of Poets.\" Tasso  sought his advice; the Chancellor Michel de l'Hospital wrote in his  praise; Brantome placed him above Petrarch; Queen Elizabeth and Mary  Stuart sent him gifts; Charles IX. on one occasion invited him to  sit beside the throne. In his last hours he was still occupied with  his art. His death, at the close of 1585, was felt as a national  calamity, and pompous honours were awarded to his tomb. Yet Ronsard,  though ambitious of literary distinction, did not lose his true self  in a noisy fame. His was the delicate nature of an artist; his deafness  perhaps added to his timidity and his love of retirement; we think  of him in his garden, cultivating his roses as \"the priest of Flora.\"    His work as a poet falls into four periods. From 1550 to 1554 he was  a humanist without discretion or reserve. In the first three books  of the _Odes_ he attempted to rival Pindar; in the _Amours de  Cassandre_ he emulates the glory of Petrarch. From 1554 to 1560,  abandoning his Pindarism, he was in discipleship to Anacreon[1] and  Horace. It is the period of the less ambitious odes found in the fourth  and fifth books,"]]]
