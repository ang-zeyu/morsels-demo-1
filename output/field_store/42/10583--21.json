[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#17)"],[1,"sweetheart; and for you all the  little pleasure of your first term at school has gone.    But what of Jerry?  He comes to you in the morning as if nothing had  happened, with a \"How are you, old fellow?\"    You are so indignant you can't speak; all you are able to do is to glare  in scorn and anger.    \"Afraid you're not well,\" remarks the sneak; \"change of scene, you know.  I hope you'll soon be better.\"    Just as he is going you manage, though almost bursting with the effort,  to stammer out--\"What do you mean by telling tales of me to all the  fellows?\"  He looks perplexed, as if at a loss for your meaning.  \"Tell  tales of you?\" says he.  \"I don't know what you mean, old chap.\"    \"Yes, you do.  How did they all know all about me this morning, if you  hadn't told them?\"    Then, as if your meaning suddenly dawned upon him, he breaks into a  forced laugh, and exclaims--    \"Oh, the chaff between Tom and Jack!  I was awfully angry with Jack for  beginning it--awfully angry.  We happened to be talking last night, you  know, about home, and I just mentioned what you had told me, never  thinking the fellow would be such a cad as to let it out.\"    You are so much taken aback at the impudence of the fellow, that you let  him walk away without another word.  If you have derived no other  advantage from your first day at school, you have at least learned to  know the character of Jerry.  And you find it out better as you go on.    If you quarrel with him, and threaten him with condign punishment, he  will report you to the doctor, and you'll get an imposition.  If you sit  up beyond hours reading, he'll contrive to let the monitors know, and  your book will be confiscated; if you happen to be \"spinning a yarn\"  with a chum in your study, you will generally find, if you open the door  suddenly, that he is not very far from the keyhole; if you get up a  party to partake of a smuggled supper in the dormitory, he will conduct  a master to the scene, and get you into a row.  There's no secret so  deadly he won't get hold of; nothing you want kept quiet that he won't  spread all round the school.  In fact, there's scarcely anything he does  not put his finger into, and everything he puts his finger into he  spoils.    If, in a weak moment of benevolence, you take him back into your  confidence and friendship, no one will be more humble and forgiving and  affable; but he will just use your new favour as a weapon for paying  back old grudges, and sorely will you repent your folly.    In fact, there is only one place for Jerry--that place is Coventry.  That city is famous for one sneak already.  Let Jerry keep him company.  There he can tell tales, and peep and listen and wriggle to his heart's  content.  He'll please himself, and do no one any harm.    A sneak has not always the plea of self-interest for his meanness.  Often enough his tale-bearing or his mischief-making can not only do his  victims incalculable harm, but cannot do him any possible good.    What good did the snake in the fable expect who, having been rescued,  and warmed and restored to life by the merciful woodcutter, turned on  his deliverer and stung him?  No wonder the good fellow knocked him on  the head!  I knew another sneak once who seemed to make a regular  profession of this amiable propensity.  He seemed to consider his path  in life was to detect and inform on whatever, to his small mind, seemed  a culpable offence.  In the middle of school, all of a sudden his raspy  voice would lift itself up in ejaculations like these, addressed to the  master,--    \"Please, sir,\" (he always prefaced his remarks with \"Please, sir\"),  \"Please, sir, Tom Cobb's eating an apple!\"    \"Please, sir, Jenkins has made a blot!\"    \"Please, sir, Allen junior is cutting his name on the desk!\"    Perhaps the indignant Allen junior would here take occasion to  acknowledge his sense of this attention by a private kick under the  desk.  Then it would be--    \"All right, Joe Allen; _I'll sneak of you_, you see if I don't!\"    No one could do it better.    Amiable little pet, how we all loved him!    Sneaking seems to be a sort of disease with some people.  There's no  other way of accounting for it.  It sometimes seems as if the mere sight  of happiness or success in others is the signal for its breaking out.  As we have said, its two leading motives are cowardice and jealousy.  Just as the cur will wait till the big dog has passed by, and then,  slinking up behind, give a surreptitious snap at his heels, so the  sneak, instead of standing face to face with his rival, and instead of  entering into fair competition with him, creeps up unobserved and  inflicts his wound on the sly.    Thus it has been with all traitors and spies and deserters and mischief-  makers since the world began.  What a list one could give of the sneaks  of history, beginning at that arch-serpent who marred the happiness of  Eden, down to some of the informers and renegades of the present day!    Boys cannot be too early on their guard against sneaking habits.  No  truly English boy, we are glad to think, is likely to fall into them;  still, even among our own acquaintance, it is sad to think how many  there are who are not wholly free from the reproach.    The child in the nursery who begins to tell tales to his mother of his  little brothers and sisters will, if not corrected, grow up to be just  such another sneak as Jerry; and Jerry, unless he cures himself of his  vice, will become a mere odious meddler and scandalmonger in society,  and may arrive at the unenviable distinction of being the most detested  man of his generation.    Every disease has its cure.  Be honest, be brave, be kind, and have  always a good conscience, and you _cannot_ be a sneak.        CHAPTER NINE.    THE SULKY BOY.    We all know him.  He might be a good-looking fellow, perhaps, if it  weren't for the scowl over his eyes and the everlasting pout about his  lips.  He skulks about with his hands in his pockets, and his head hung  down.  We all make room for him, and give him a wide berth; no one is  anxious to be chosen upon the same side with him at chevy, or to get the  desk next his in school.  It's a fact we are all afraid of him, though  we all despise him.  He makes everybody unhappy, by being miserable  himself for no reason at all.    Sometimes, indeed, he can be jolly enough--when he chooses.  No one  could tell at such times that there was anything queer about him; but  then all of a sudden he shows in his true colours (and dingy enough  colours they are), and then it is all up with enjoyment till he takes  himself off, which he generally does before long.    All this is very sad; and if I say a word or two about sulkiness now, it  will be in the hope of inducing my readers to give no encouragement to  so ugly a vice.    There are two ways of showing anger, when one is unfortunate enough to  be under the necessity of being angry.  You can't always help it.  Some  people are never put out.  However much you rile them, they are always  good-humoured, always cool, always friendly.  You might as well try to  talk the sun behind a cloud as to get them in a rage.  Happy the few who  have this art!  They always get the best of it, they always win the  greatest respect, they always are the least likely people for any one to  quarrel with.    I don't count these among the two classes of angry people, because they  are not angry.  But angry people are generally either in a rage or in  the sulks.  Neither is pleasant to meet, yet for my own part I would  sooner have to do with the fellow in the rage.  There's no deception  about him; he's angry, and he lets you know it; he's got a grievance,  and he blurts out what it is; he hits straight out from the shoulder,  and you know what you've to expect.  With such a one it is generally  soon all over.  Just as the April shower, sharp enough while it lasts,  gives place in time to the sun, so Will Hothead generally gets all right  as soon as he has let the steam off; and when he shakes hands and makes  it up, you are pretty sure he thinks none the worse of you, and bears no  malice.    Don't imagine I'm trying to justify exhibitions of temper.  Far from it.  I say every boy who can't control his temper has yet to learn one of  the greatest lessons of life.  What I want to show is that even passion,  bad as it is, is not so bad as sulkiness.    For just consider what a miserable sort of boy this Tom Sulks, that we  all of us know, is.  Why, almost before he could speak he had learned to  pout.  If a toy was denied him, he neither bellowed like his little  brother nor raved like his little sister, but toddled off and sulked in  a corner all day long.  When he grew a little older, if he was not  allowed to play in the garden because it was damp, he refused to play in  the nursery, he refused to come down to the dining-room, he refused to  say his prayers at bedtime.  When he was old enough to go to school, he  would either play marbles the way he was used to (which was the wrong  way), or not at all.  If found fault with for not knowing his lesson, he  pushed his books from him, and endured to be stood in the corner, or  punished some other way, rather than learn his task.  The vice only  became worse and worse as time went on, and to-day Tom is an odious  fellow.  Look at him playing at cricket.  He steps across the wickets to  hit at a ball, but, instead, stops it with his foot.  \"How's that,  umpire?\" cries the bowler.  \"Out, leg before,\" is the answer.    Tom still keeps his place.    \"Out, do you hear, leg before?\"    \"It wasn't!\" growls Tom.    \"The umpire gives it out,\" is the unanswerable reply.    Thereupon Tom's face clouds over, his eyebrows gather, and his lips  shape themselves into a pout, as he drops his bat and walks from the  wicket without a word.  No one takes any notice of him, for the event is  too common, alas, to occasion surprise.  We know what his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#17)"],[1," toe without membrane. Color of foot, always black.     5. Beak. Long, slender, straight. (How long? Drawn as about a fifth  of the bird's length--say an inch, or a little over.) Upper mandible  slightly curved down at the point. In Titania arctica, the beak is  longer and more slender.     6. Voice. A sharp, short cry, not conceived by me enough to spell any  likeness of it.     7. Temper. Gentle, passing into stupid, (it seems to me); one, in  meditative travel, lets itself be knocked down by a gardener with his  spade.     8. Nest. Little said of it, the bird breeding chiefly in the North.  Among marshes, it is of weeds and grass; but among icebergs, of what?     9. Eggs. Pear-shape; narrow ends together in nest; never more than  four.    10. Brood. No account of.    11. Feathers. Mostly gray, passing into brown in summer, varied with  white on margin. Reddish chestnut or bay bodice--well oiled or  varnished.    12. Uses. Fortunately, at present, unknown.      V.    RALLUS AQUATICUS.    WATER-RAIL.    116. Thus far, we have got for representatives of our dabchick group,  eight species of little birds--namely, two Torrent-ouzels, three  Lily-ouzels, one Grebe, and two Titanias. And these we associate,  observe, not for any specialty of feature in them, but for common  character, habit, and size; so that, if perchance a child playing by  any stream, or on the sea-sands, perceives a companionable bird  dabbling in an equally childish and pleasant manner, he may not have to  look through half a dozen volumes of ornithology to find it; but may be  pretty sure it has been one of these eight. And having once fastened  the characters of these well in his mind, he may with ease remember  that the little grebe is the least of a family of chestnut-leaf-footed,  and sharp-billed creatures, which yet in size, color, and diving power,  go necessarily among Ducks, and cannot be classed with Dabblers; though  it must be always as distinctly kept in mind that a duck _proper_ has a  flat beak, and a fully webbed foot.    Again, he may recollect that with these leaf-footed ducks of the calm  and fresh waters, must be associated the leaf-footed or fringe-footed  ducks of the sea;--'phalaropes,' which by their short wings connect  themselves with many clumsy marine creatures, on their way to become  seals instead of birds; and that I have kept the two little Titanias  out of this class, not merely for their niceness, but because they are  not short-winged in any vulgar degree, but seem to have wings about as  long as a sandpiper's;--and indeed I had put the purple sandpiper,  Arquatella maritima, with them, in my own folio; only as the  Arquatella's feet are not chestnutty, she had better go with her own  kind in our notes on them.    117. But there are yet two birds, which I think well to put with our  eight dabchicks, though they are much larger than any of them,--partly  because of their disposition, and partly because of their plumage,--the  water-rail, and water-hen. Modern science, with instinctive horror of  all that is pretty to see, or easy to remember, entirely rejects the  plumage, as any element or noticeable condition of bird-kinds; nor have  I ever yet tried to make it one myself; yet there are certain qualities  of downiness in ducks, fluffiness in owls, spottiness in thrushes,  patchiness in pies, bronzed or rusty luster in cocks, and pearly  iridescence in doves, which I believe may be aptly brought into  connection with other defining characters; and when we find an entirely  similar disposition of plumage, and nearly the same form, in two birds,  I do not think that _mere_ difference in size should far separate them.    Bewick, accordingly, calls the water-rail the 'Brook-ouzel,' and puts  it between the little crake and the water-ouzel; but he does not say a  word of its living by brooks,--only 'in low wet places.' Buffon,  however, takes it with the land-rail; Gould and Yarrell put it between  the little crake and water-hen. Gould's description of it is by no  means clear to me:--he first says it is, in action, as much \"like a rat  as a bird;\" then that it \"bounds like a ball,\" (before the nose of the  spaniel); and lastly, in the next sentence, speaks of it as \"this  _lath_-like bird\"! It is as large as a bantam, but can run, like the  Allegretta, on floating leaves; itself, weighing about four ounces and  a half (Bewick), and rarely uses the wing, flying very slowly. I  imagine the 'lath-like' must mean, like the more frequent epithet  'compressed,' that the bird's body is vertically thin, so as to go  easily between close reeds.    118. We will try our twelve questions again.     1. Country. Equally numerous in every part of Europe, in Africa,  India, China, and Japan; yet hardly anybody seems to have seen it.  Living, however, \"near the perennial fountains\" (wherever those may  be;--it sounds like the garden of Eden!) \"during the greater part of  the winter, the birds pass Malta in spring and autumn, and have been  seen fifty leagues at sea off the coast of Portugal\" (Buffon); but  where coming from, or going to, is not told. Tunis is the most  southerly place named by Yarrell.     2. Food. Anything small enough to be swallowed, that lives in mud or  water.     3. Form and flight. I am puzzled, as aforesaid, between its likeness  to a ball, and a lath. Flies heavily and unwillingly, hanging its legs  down.     4. Foot. Long-toed and flexible.     5. Beak. Sharp and strong, some inch and a half long, showing  distinctly the cimeter-curve of a gull's, near the point.     6. Voice. No account of.     7. Temper. Quite easily tamable, though naturally shy. Feeds out of  the hand in a day or two, if fed regularly in confinement.     8. Nest. \"Slight, of leaves and strips of flags\" (Gould); \"of sedge  and grass, rarely found,\" (Yarrell). Size not told.     9. Eggs. Eight or nine! cream-white, with rosy yolk!! rather larger  than a blackbird's!!!    10. Brood. Velvet black, with white bills; hunting with the utmost  activity from the minute they are hatched.    11. Feathers. Brown on the back, a beautiful warm ash gray on the  breast, and under the wings transverse stripes of very dark gray and  white. The disposition of pattern is almost exactly the same as in the  Allegretta.    12. Uses. By many thought delicious eating. (Bewick.) The fact is, or  seems to me, that this entire group of marsh birds is meant to become  to us the domestic poultry of marshy land; and I imagine that by  proper irrigation and care, many districts of otherwise useless bog  and sand, might be made more profitable to us than many fishing-grounds.      VI.    PULLA AQUATICA.    WATER-HEN.    (_Gallinula Chloropus.--Pennant, Bewick, Gould, and Yarrell._)    119. 'Green-footed little cock, or hen,' that is to say, in English;  only observe, if you call the Fringe-foot a Phalarope, you ought in  consistency to call the Green-foot a Chlorope. Their feet are not only  notable for greenness, but for size: they are very ugly, having the  awkward and ill-used look of the feet of Scratchers, while a trace of  beginning membrane connects them with the fringe-foots.    Their proper name would be Marsh-cock, which would enough distinguish  them from the true Moor-cock or Black-cock. 'Moat-cock' would be  prettier, and characteristic; for in the old English days they used to  live much in the moats of manor-houses; mine is the name nearest to the  familiar one; only note there is no proper feminine of 'pullus,' and I  use the adjective 'pulla' to express the dark color.    It is a dark-_brown_ bird, according to the colored pictures--iron  _gray_, Buffon says, with white stripes of little order on the bodice,  clumsy feet and bill, but makes up for all ungainliness by its gentle  and intelligent mind; and seems meant for a useful possession to  mankind all over the world, for it lives in Siberia and New Zealand; in  Senegal and Jamaica; in Scotland, Switzerland, and Prussia; in Corfu,  Crete, and Trebizond; in Canada, and at the Cape. I find no account of  its migrations, and one would think that a bird which usually flies  \"dip, dip, dipping with its toes, and leaving a track along the water  like that of a stone at 'ducks and drakes'\" (Yarrell), would not  willingly adventure itself on the Atlantic. It must have a kind of  human facility in adapting itself to climate, as it has human  domesticity of temper, with curious fineness of sagacity and sympathies  in taste. A family of them, petted by a clergyman's wife, were  constantly adding materials to their nest, and \"made real havoc in the  flower-garden,--for though straw and leaves are their chief ingredients,  they seem to have an eye for beauty, and the old hen has been seen  surrounded with a brilliant wreath of scarlet anemones.\" Thus Bishop  Stanley, whose account of the bird is full of interesting particulars.  This aesthetic water-hen, with her husband, lived at Cheadle, in  Staffordshire, in the rectory moat, for several seasons, \"always  however leaving it in the spring,\" (for Scotland, supposably?): being  constantly fed, the pair became quite tame, built their nest in a  thorn-bush covered with ivy which had fallen into the water; and \"when  the young are a few days old, the old ones bring them up close to the  drawing-room window, where they are regularly fed with wheat; and, as  the lady of the house pays them the greatest attention, they have  learned to look up to her as their natural protectress and friend; so  much so, that one bird in particular, which was much persecuted by the  rest, would, when attacked, fly to her for refuge; and whenever she  calls, the whole flock, as tame as barn-door fowls, quit the water, and  assemble round her, to the number of seventeen. (November, 1833.)    120. \"They have also made other friends in the dogs belonging to the  family, approaching them without fear, though hurrying off with great  alarm on the appearance of a strange dog.    \"The"]]]
