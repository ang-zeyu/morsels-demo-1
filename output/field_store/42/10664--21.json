In seasons when the water is low in the Humboldt River, there is much  less danger of the alkali, as the running water in the river then comes  from pure mountain springs, and is confined to the channel; whereas,  during high water, when the banks are overflowed, the salts are  dissolved, making the water more impure.    For _colic_, a good remedy is a mixture of two table-spoonfuls of  brandy and two tea-spoonfuls of laudanum dissolved in a bottle of water  and poured down the animal's throat. Another remedy, which has been  recommended to me by an experienced officer as producing speedy relief,  is a table-spoonful of chloride of lime dissolved in a bottle of water,  and administered as in the other case.      RATTLESNAKE BITES.    Upon the southern routes to California rattlesnakes are often met with,  but it is seldom that any person is bitten by them; yet this is a  possible contingency, and it can never be amiss to have an antidote at  hand.    Hartshorn applied externally to the wound, and drunk in small  quantities diluted with water whenever the patient becomes faint or  exhausted from the effects of the poison, is one of the most common  remedies.    In the absence of all medicines, a string or ligature should at once be  bound firmly above the puncture, then scarify deeply with a knife, suck  out the poison, and spit out the saliva.    Andersson, in his book on Southwestern Africa, says: \"In the Cape  Colony the Dutch farmers resort to a cruel but apparently effective  plan to counteract the bad effects of a serpent's bite. An incision  having been made in the breast of a living fowl, the bitten part is  applied to the wound. If the poison be very deadly, the bird soon  evinces symptoms of distress, becomes drowsy, droops its head, and  dies. It is replaced by a second, a third, and more if requisite. When,  however, the bird no longer exhibits any of the signs just mentioned,  the patient is considered out of danger. A frog similarly applied is  supposed to be equally efficacious.\"    Haunberg, in his Travels in South Africa, mentions an antidote against  the bite of serpents. He says: \"The blood of the turtle was much cried  up, which, on account of this extraordinary virtue, the inhabitants dry  in the form of small scales or membranes, and carry about them when  they travel in this country, which swarms with this most noxious  vermin. Whenever any one is wounded by a serpent, he takes a couple of  pinches of the dried blood internally, and applies a little of it to  the wound.\"    I was present upon one occasion when an Indian child was struck in the  fore finger by a large rattlesnake. His mother, who was near at the  time, seized him in her arms, and, placing the wounded finger in her  mouth, sucked the poison from the puncture for some minutes, repeatedly  spitting out the saliva; after which she chewed and mashed some  plantain leaves and applied to the wound. Over this she sprinkled some  finely-powdered tobacco, and wrapped the finger up in a rag. I did not  observe that the child suffered afterward the least pain or  inconvenience. The immediate application of the remedies probably saved  his life.    Irritation from the bite of gnats and musquitoes, etc., may be relieved  by chewing the plantain, and rubbing the spittle on the bite.    I knew of another instance near Fort Towson, in Northern Texas, where a  small child was left upon the earthen floor of a cabin while its mother  was washing at a spring near by. She heard a cry of distress, and, on  going to the cabin, what was her horror on seeing a rattlesnake coiled  around the child's arm, and striking it repeatedly with its fangs.  After killing the snake, she hurried to her nearest neighbor, procured  a bottle of brandy, and returned as soon as possible; but the poison  had already so operated upon the arm that it was as black as a negro's.  She poured down the child's throat a huge draught of the liquor, which  soon took effect, making it very drunk, and stopped the action of the  poison. Although the child was relieved, it remained sick for a long  time, but ultimately recovered.    A man was struck in the leg by a very large rattlesnake near Fort  Belknap, Texas, in 1853. No other remedy being at hand, a small piece  of indigo was pulverized, made into a poultice with water, and applied  to the puncture. It seemed to draw out the poison, turning the indigo  white, after which it was removed and another poultice applied. These  applications were repeated until the indigo ceased to change its color.  The man was then carried to the hospital at Fort Belknap, and soon  recovered, and the surgeon of the post pronounced it a very  satisfactory cure.    A Chickasaw woman, who was bitten upon the foot near Fort Washita by a  ground rattlesnake (a very venomous species), drank a bottle of whisky  and applied the indigo poultice, and when I saw her, three days  afterward, she was recovering, but the flesh around the wound sloughed  away.    A Delaware remedy, which is said to be efficacious, is to burn powder  upon the wound, but I have never known it to be tried excepting upon a  horse. In this case it was successful, or, at all events, the animal  recovered.    Of all the remedies known to me, I should decidedly prefer ardent  spirits. It is considered a sovereign antidote among our Western  frontier settlers, and I would make use of it with great confidence. It  must be taken until the patient becomes very much intoxicated, and this  requires a large quantity, as the action of the poison seems to  counteract its effects.    Should the fangs of the snake penetrate deep enough to reach an artery,  it is probable the person would die in a short time. I imagine,  however, that this does not often occur.    The following remedial measures for the treatment of the bites of  poisonous reptiles are recommended by Dr. Philip Weston in the London  Lancet for July, 1859:    1. The application of a ligature round the limb close to the wound,  between it and the heart, to arrest the return of venous blood.    2. Excision of the bitten parts, or free incision through the wounds  made by the poison-teeth, subsequently encouraging the bleeding by warm  solutions to favor the escape of the poison from the circulation.    3. Cauterization widely round the limb of the bite with a strong  solution of nitrate of silver, one drachm to the ounce, to prevent the  introduction of the poison into the system by the lymphatics.    4. As soon as indications of the absorption of the poison into the  circulation begin to manifest themselves, the internal administration  of ammonia in aerated or soda-water every quarter of an hour, to  support the nervous energy and allay the distressing thirst.    \"But,\" he continues, \"there is yet wanting some remedy that shall  rapidly counteract the poison introduced into the blood, and assist in  expelling it from the system. The well-authenticated accounts of the  success attending the internal use of arsenic in injuries arising from  the bites of venomous reptiles in the East and West Indies, and also in  Africa, and the well-known properties of this medicine as a powerful  tonic and alterative in conditions of impaired vitality of the blood  arising from the absorption of certain blood-poisons, would lead me to  include this agent in the treatment already mentioned. It should be  administered in combination with ammonia, in full doses, frequently  repeated, so as to neutralize quickly the poison circulating in the  blood before it can be eliminated from the system. This could readily  be accomplished by adding ten to fifteen minims of Fowler's solution to  the compound spirit of ammonia, to be given every quarter of an hour in  aerated or soda-water, until the vomiting and the more urgent symptoms  of collapse have subsided, subsequently repeating the dose at longer  intervals until reaction had become fully established, and the patient  relieved by copious bilious dejections.\"    _Cedron_, which is a nut that grows on the Isthmus of Panama, and which  is sold by the druggists in New York, is said to be an infallible  antidote to serpent-bites. In the _Bullet. de l'Acad. de Med._ for  February, 1858, it is stated that a man was bitten at Panama by a  _coral snake_, the most poisonous species on the Isthmus. During the  few seconds that it took him to take the cedron from his bag, he was  seized with violent pains at the heart and throat; but he had scarcely  chewed and swallowed a piece of the nut about the size of a small bean,  when the pains ceased as by magic. He chewed a little more, and applied  it externally to the wound, when the pains disappeared, and were  followed by a copious evacuation of a substance like curdled milk. Many  other cases are mentioned where the cedron proved an antidote.          CHAPTER V.    Bivouacs. Tente d'Abri. Gutta-percha Knapsack Tent. Comanche Lodge.  Sibley Tent. Camp Furniture. Litters.

In traveling with pack animals it is not always convenient or  practicable to transport tents, and the traveler's ingenuity is often  taxed in devising the most available means for making himself  comfortable and secure against winds and storms. I have often been  astonished to see how soon an experienced voyager, without any  resources save those provided by nature, will erect a comfortable  shelter in a place where a person having no knowledge of woodcraft  would never think of such a thing.

Thus, in his own quaint fashion, the enthusiastic old Herald of the  seventeenth century indicates the number and variety of the Charges,  which in process of time had been introduced into Armory even before his  era. In earlier days the Charges of Heraldry were much less varied,  comparatively few in their numbers, and generally of a simple character.  It will readily be understood, however, that fresh figures and devices  would continually appear in blazon; and also that these, in their turn,  would lead the way for the introduction of further varieties and new  modifications.    Human Beings are of very rare occurrence, except as Supporters. Parts of  the human frame constantly appear, but they are more generally borne as  Crests upon helms than as charges on shields. \"Moor's heads\" or  \"Saracen's heads\" appear in some coats, with arms, hands and legs: and a  human heart is well known as a charge in the coat of the famous house of  DOUGLAS, where it was placed to commemorate the duty entrusted by ROBERT  BRUCE to the \"good Sir JAMES DOUGLAS,\" that he should bear with him the  heart of his Sovereign and friend to the Holy Land, and bury it there.  Sir James fell, fighting with the Moors of Spain, A.D. 1330. This Shield  of Douglas is a characteristic example of the gradual development of  armorial composition. About A.D. 1290, the Seal of WILLIAM, Lord  DOUGLAS, displays his Shield, No. 155, bearing--_Arg., on a chief az.  three mullets of the field._ Next, upon the field of the Shield of  WILLIAM, Lord DOUGLAS, A.D. 1333, there appears, in addition, _a human  heart gules_, as in No. 156. And, finally, the heart is ensigned with a  _royal crown_, as in No. 157, this form appearing as early as 1387.      [Illustration: No. 155.--Shield of Douglas.]      [Illustration: No. 156.--Shield of Douglas.]      [Illustration: No. 157.--Shield of Douglas.]      [Illustration: No. 158.--Isle of Man.]    The Shield of the ancient kingdom of the ISLE OF MAN, No. 158, still  continues to be the heraldic ensign of that island: it is--_Gu., three  human legs in armour ppr., conjoined in the fesse-point at the upper  part of the thighs, and flexed in triangle._ This true curiosity of  Heraldry leads Mr. Planché to remark, that \"the _arms_ of MAN are  _legs_\" (\"Pursuivant of Arms,\" p. 112). The Shield represented in No.  158 is drawn from an original example of the age of EDWARD I. in the  Heralds' College. At later periods, the armour of the conjoined limbs is  represented in conformity with the usages then prevalent, and golden  spurs are added. The ancient symbol of the island of Sicily, in which  the limbs are without either armour or clothing, has been represented in  No. 10: this device also appears in ancient examples with a human head  at the junction of the limbs. Three human arms, united in the same  manner, are borne on the shield of the mediæval family of TREMAINE.      [Illustration: No. 159.--Shield of St. Alban's Abbey    (partly restored).]    Human figures, winged and vested, and designed to represent ANGELS, are  occasionally introduced in English Heraldry, their office generally  being to act as \"Supporters\" to armorial Shields. Fine examples, in  admirable preservation, may be seen boldly sculptured in the noble  timber-roof of Westminster Hall; also in panels over the principal  entrance to the Hall, and in various parts of the Abbey of Westminster.  In the grand Abbey Church of St. Alban at St. Alban's, numerous other  examples of great excellence yet remain, the works of Abbot John de  Wheathamstede, about A.D. 1440. In No. 159 I give a representation of  the Shield of Arms of the Abbey of ST. ALBAN--_Az., a saltire or_,  supported by Angels, and the Shield ensigned by the Mitre of Abbot  Thomas De la Mere, as it is represented in his noble Brass in the Abbey  Church. The Shield and the Angel Figures are the work of Abbot John. The  Heads of the Figures, which are destroyed in the original, are restored  from stained glass of the same period in the Abbey Church. Figures of  Angels holding Shields of Arms--each figure having a shield in front of  its breast, are frequently sculptured as corbels in Gothic churches.    In the earliest Rolls of Arms, the Lion is the only animal that is found  in blazon, with the sole addition of Boar's heads. Deer, dogs, bulls,  calves, rams, and a few other animals subsequently appear to share  heraldic service and honours with the king of beasts. In modern Armory,  however, almost every living creature has been required to discharge  such duties as Heralds have been pleased to assign to them. The Lion of  Heraldry I leave to be considered, with the Eagle, in the next Chapter.  In comparatively early blazon, the _Bear_ is borne by FITZ URSE: the  _Calf_, by CALVELEY and DE VELE: the _Ram_, by RAMSEY and RAMRYGE: the  _Lamb_, by LAMBERT and LAMBTON: the _Otter_ (_loutre_, in French), by  LUTTREL: the _Hedgehog_ (Fr., _herrison_), by DE HERIZ, afterwards  HARRIS: and so also, in like manner, some other animals appear as _armes  parlantes_ (see p. 16).    With the lordly Eagle a few other Birds are associated in early  Heraldry: and, after a while, others join them, including the Falcon,  Ostrich, Swan, Peacock or Pawne, and the Pelican borne both as a symbol  of sacred significance, and also by the PELHAMS from being allusive to  their name. Cocks, with the same allusive motive, were borne by  COCKAYNE: Parrots, blazoned as \"_Popinjays_,\" appear as early as  HENRY III.: and in a Roll of EDWARD II., the Sire MOUNPYNZON has a Lion  charged on the shoulder with a Chaffinch--in French a _Pinson_. The  favourite bird, however, of the early Heralds is the Martlet, the  heraldic Martin, a near relative of the Swallow or _Hirondelle_. The  Martlet is practically always represented in profile, at rest, and with  its wings closed. The few exceptions are modern. In some early examples  the feet are shown, as in No. 160: but, in the Shield of Earl WM. DE  VALENCE in Westminster Abbey, A.D. 1296, the Martlet appears feetless,  as in No. 161; and at a later period this mode of representation was  generally adopted. French Heralds deprive their Martlets of beak as well  as feet.      [Illustration: No. 160.--Early Martlet.]      [Illustration: No. 161.--Martlet.]      [Illustration: No. 162.--Banner of De Barre.]    \"As the symbol of a name,\" writes Mr. Moule, \"almost all Fish have been  used in Heraldry; and in many instances Fish have been assumed in Arms  in reference to the produce of the estate, giving to the quaint device a  twofold interest\" (\"Heraldry of Fish,\" p 13). The earliest examples are  the Barbel, the Dolphin, the Luce (or Pike), the Herring, and the Roach.  In conjunction with fish we may perhaps consider the Escallop which, as  a charge, belongs to the earliest period of Heraldry. The Barbel, so  named from the barbs attached to its mouth to assist it in its search  for food, was introduced into English Heraldry by JOHN, Count DE BARRE,  whose elder brother married ALIANORE, eldest daughter of EDWARD I. At  Carlaverock he displayed, as the chronicler has recorded, \"_a blue  banner, crusilly, with two Barbels of gold, and a red border  en-grailed_,\" No. 162. The Dolphin, borne by GILES DE FISHBOURNE (H. 3),  and afterwards introduced into several English Shields, is best known as  the armorial ensign of the DAUPHIN, the eldest son and heir apparent of  the Kings of France, who bore, marshalled with the arms of FRANCE--_Or,  a Dolphin az._ This title of \"Dauphin\" was first assumed by CHARLES V.,  who succeeded to the Crown of France in 1364. In No. 8 I have shown  after what manner the Dolphin was represented by an ancient Greek  Artist: in the Middle Ages the heraldic Dolphin appeared as in No. 163.  GEFFREY DE LUCY (H. 3) bears--_Gu., three Lucies or._ On his marriage  with the heiress of ANTHONY, Lord LUCY, in 1369, HENRY, fourth Lord  PERCY of Alnwick, quartered these three fish, with his own lion (blue on  a golden field) and his fusils (gold on a blue field), upon the  well-known Shield of the Earls of NORTHUMBERLAND (Chapter XI).      [Illustration: No. 163.--Dolphin.]      [Illustration: No. 165.--Escallop.]      [Illustration: No. 164.--De Lucy.]    Another Carlaverock Banneret, ROBERT DE SCALES, whom the chronicler  declares to have been both \"handsome and amiable\" as well as gallant in  action, had \"_six escallops of silver on a red banner_.\" This beautiful  charge of the escallop, happy in its association with the pilgrims of  the olden time, and always held in high esteem by Heralds, is generally  drawn as in No. 165.    Reptiles and Insects occur but rarely in English Heraldry. Bees, Flies,  Butterflies, and Snails are sometimes found, but they have no place in  the earliest Rolls of Arms. Bees, as might be expected, appear in the  Arms of _Bees_ton. _Azure, three Butterflies_, are the Arms of MUSCHAMP,  and they are carved twice in the vaulting of the cloisters at  Canterbury. Upon a monumental brass in the Church of Wheathampstead, in  Hertfordshire, the Shield of HUGO BOSTOCK (about A.D. 1435)  bears,--_Arg., three Bats, their wings displayed, sa._    Imaginary and Fabulous Beings, some of them the creations of heraldic  fancy when in a strangely eccentric mood, frequently appear as  Supporters;"]]]
