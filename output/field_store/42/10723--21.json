Albeit its pre-requisite may be  musico-aesthetic education, and _particularly_ with _moral_ indifference.        46.      In Wagner we find the most ambitious _combination_ of all means with the  view of obtaining the strongest effect whereas genuine musicians quietly  develop individual _genres_.        47.      Dramatists are _borrowers_--their principal source of wealth--artistic  thoughts drawn from the epos. Wagner borrowed from classical music  besides. Dramatists are constructive geniuses, they are not inventive and  original as the epic poets are. Drama takes a lower rank than the epos: it  presupposes a coarser and more democratic public.        48.      Wagner does not altogether trust _music_. He weaves kindred sensations  into it in order to lend it the character of greatness. He measures  himself on others; he first of all gives his listeners intoxicating drinks  in order to lead them into believing that it _was the music that  intoxicated them_.        49.      The same amount of talent and industry which makes the classic, when it  appears some time _too late_, also makes the baroque artist like Wagner.        50.      Wagner's art is calculated to appeal to short-sighted people--one has to  get much too close up to it (Miniature): it also appeals to long-sighted  people, but not to those with normal sight.          _Contradictions in the Idea of Musical Drama._        51.      Just listen to the second act of the \"Goetterdaemmerung,\" without the drama.  It is chaotic music, as wild as a bad dream, and it is as frightfully  distinct as if it desired to make itself clear even to deaf people. This  volubility _with nothing to say_ is alarming. Compared with it the drama  is a genuine relief.--Is the fact that this music when heard alone, is, as  a whole intolerable (apart from a few intentionally isolated parts) in its  _favour_? Suffice it to say that this music without its accompanying  drama, is a perpetual contradiction of all the highest laws of style  belonging to older music: he who thoroughly accustoms himself to it, loses  all feeling for these laws. But has the drama _been improved_ thanks to  this addition? A _symbolic interpretation_ has been affixed to it, a sort  of philological commentary, which sets fetters upon the inner and free  understanding of the imagination--it is tyrannical. Music is the language  of the commentator, who talks the whole of the time and gives us no  breathing space. Moreover his is a difficult language which also requires  to be explained. He who step by step has mastered, first the libretto  (language!), then converted it into action in his mind's eye, then sought  out and understood, and became familiar with the musical symbolism  thereto: aye, and has fallen in love with all three things: such a man  then experiences a great joy. But how _exacting_! It is quite impossible  to do this save for a few short moments,--such tenfold attention on the  part of one's eyes, ears, understanding, and feeling, such acute activity  in apprehending without any productive reaction, is far too  exhausting!--Only the very fewest behave in this way: how is it then that  so many are affected? Because most people are only intermittingly  attentive, and are inattentive for sometimes whole passages at a stretch;  because they bestow their undivided attention now upon the music, later  upon the drama, and anon upon the scenery--that is to say they _take the  work to pieces_.--But in this way the kind of work we are discussing is  condemned: not the drama but a moment of it is the result, an arbitrary  selection. The creator of a new _genre_ should consider this! The arts  should not always be dished up together,--but we should imitate the  moderation of the ancients which is truer to human nature.        52.      Wagner reminds one of lava which blocks its own course by congealing, and  suddenly finds itself checked by dams which it has itself built. There is  no _Allegro con fuoco_ for him.        53.      I compare Wagner's music, which would fain have the same effect as speech,  with that kind of sculptural relief which would have the same effect as  painting. The highest laws of style are violated, and that which is most  sublime can no longer be achieved.        54.      The general heaving, undulating and rolling of Wagner's art.        55.      In regard to Wagner's rejection of form, we are reminded of Goethe's  remark in conversation with Eckermann: \"there is no great art in being  brilliant if one respects nothing.\"        56.      Once one theme is over, Wagner is always embarrassed as to how to  continue. Hence the long preparation, the suspense. His peculiar  craftiness consisted in transvaluing his weakness into virtues.--        57.      The _lack_ of melody and the poverty of melody in Wagner. Melody is a  whole consisting of many beautiful proportions, it is the reflection of a  well-ordered soul. He strives after melody; but if he finds one, he almost  suffocates it in his embrace.        58.      The natural nobility of a Bach and a Beethoven, the beautiful soul (even  of a Mendelssohn) are wanting in Wagner. He is one degree lower.        59.      Wagner imitates himself again and again--mannerisms. That is why he was the  quickest among musicians to be imitated. It is so easy.        60.      Mendelssohn who lacked the power of radically staggering one (incidentally  this was the talent of the Jews in the Old Testament), makes up for this  by the things which were his own, that is to say: freedom within the law,  and noble emotions kept within the limits of beauty.        61.      _Liszt_, the first _representative_ of all musicians, but _no musician_.  He was the prince, not the statesman. The conglomerate of a hundred  musicians' souls, but not enough of a personality to cast his own shadow  upon them.        62.      The most wholesome phenomenon is _Brahms_, in whose music there is more  German blood than in that of Wagner's. With these words I would say  something complimentary, but by no means wholly so.        63.      In Wagner's writings there is no greatness or peace, but presumption. Why?        64.      _Wagner's Style._--The habit he acquired, from his earliest days, of having  his say in the most important matters without a sufficient knowledge of  them, has rendered him the obscure and incomprehensible writer that he is.  In addition to this he aspired to imitating the witty newspaper article,  and finally acquired that presumption which readily joins hands with  carelessness \"and, behold, it was very good.\"        65.      I am alarmed at the thought of how much pleasure I could find in Wagner's  style, which is so careless as to be unworthy of such an artist.        66.      In Wagner, as in Brahms, there is a blind denial of the healthy, in his  followers this denial is deliberate and conscious.        67.      Wagner's art is for those who are conscious of an essential blunder in the  conduct of their lives. They feel either that they have checked a great  nature by a base occupation, or squandered it through idle pursuits, a  conventional marriage, &c. &c.    In this quarter the condemnation of the world is the outcome of the  condemnation of the ego.        68.      Wagnerites do not wish to alter themselves in any way, they live  discontentedly in insipid, conventional and brutal circumstances--only at  intervals does art have to raise them as by magic above these things.  Weakness of will.        69.      Wagner's art is for scholars who do not dare to become philosophers: they  feel discontented with themselves and are generally in a state of obtuse  stupefaction--from time to time they take a bath in the _opposite  conditions_.        70.      I feel as if I had recovered from an illness: with a feeling of  unutterable joy I think of Mozart's _Requiem_. I can once more enjoy  simple fare.        71.      I understand Sophocles' development through and through--it was the  repugnance to pomp and pageantry.        72.      I gained an insight into the injustice of _idealism_, by noticing that I  avenged myself on Wagner for the disappointed hopes I had cherished of  him.        73.      I leave my loftiest duty to the end, and that is to thank Wagner and  Schopenhauer publicly, and to make them as it were take sides against  themselves.        74.      I counsel everybody not to fight shy of such paths (Wagner and  Schopenhauer). The wholly _unphilosophic_ feeling of remorse, has become  quite strange to me.        _Wagner's Effects._      75.      We must strive to oppose the false after-effects of Wagner's art. If he,  in order to create Parsifal, is forced to pump fresh strength from  religious sources, this is not an example but a danger.      76.      I entertain the fear that the effects of Wagner's art will ultimately pour  into that torrent which takes its rise on the other side of the mountains,  and which knows how to flow even over mountains.(18)              FOOTNOTES          1 It should be noted that the first and second editions of these        essays on Wagner appeared in pamphlet form, for which the above        first preface was written.        2 Fisher Unwin, 1911.        3 T.

What ancient drama had in view was _grand pathetic       "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25016"],[0,"The House of Souls (#17)"],[1,"and the short of it is,' Mr. Nixon said at last, 'she's  gone stark, staring mad, and we had to put her away to-day--poor thing.'    His voice broke a little, and he wiped his eyes hastily, for though  stout and successful he was not unfeeling, and he was fond of his wife.  He had spoken quickly, and had gone lightly over many details which  might have interested specialists in certain kinds of mania, and  Darnell was sorry for his evident distress.    'I came here,' he went on after a brief pause, 'because I found out she  had been to see you last Sunday, and I knew the sort of story she must  have told.'    Darnell showed him the prophetic leaflet which Mrs. Nixon had dropped in  the garden. 'Did you know about this?' he said.    'Oh, _him_,' said the old man, with some approach to cheerfulness; 'oh  yes, I thrashed _him_ black and blue the day before yesterday.'    'Isn't he mad? Who is the man?'    'He's not mad, he's bad. He's a little Welsh skunk named Richards. He's  been running some sort of chapel over at New Barnet for the last few  years, and my poor wife--she never could find the parish church good  enough for her--had been going to his damned schism shop for the last  twelve-month. It was all that finished her off. Yes; I thrashed _him_  the day before yesterday, and I'm not afraid of a summons either. I know  him, and he knows I know him.'    Old Nixon whispered something in Darnell's ear, and chuckled faintly as  he repeated for the third time his formula--    'I thrashed _him_ black and blue the day before yesterday.'    Darnell could only murmur condolences and express his hope that Mrs.  Nixon might recover.    The old man shook his head.    'I'm afraid there's no hope of that,' he said. 'I've had the best  advice, but they couldn't do anything, and told me so.'    Presently he asked to see his niece, and Darnell went out and prepared  Mary as well as he could. She could scarcely take in the news that her  aunt was a hopeless maniac, for Mrs. Nixon, having been extremely stupid  all her days, had naturally succeeded in passing with her relations as  typically sensible. With the Reynolds family, as with the great majority  of us, want of imagination is always equated with sanity, and though  many of us have never heard of Lombroso we are his ready-made converts.  We have always believed that poets are mad, and if statistics  unfortunately show that few poets have really been inhabitants of  lunatic asylums, it is soothing to learn that nearly all poets have had  whooping-cough, which is doubtless, like intoxication, a minor madness.    'But is it really true?' she asked at length. 'Are you certain uncle is  not deceiving you? Aunt seemed so sensible always.'    She was helped at last by recollecting that Aunt Marian used to get up  very early of mornings, and then they went into the drawing-room and  talked to the old man. His evident kindliness and honesty grew upon  Mary, in spite of a lingering belief in her aunt's fables, and when he  left, it was with a promise to come to see them again.    Mrs. Darnell said she felt tired, and went to bed; and Darnell returned  to the garden and began to pace to and fro, collecting his thoughts. His  immeasurable relief at the intelligence that, after all, Mrs. Nixon was  not coming to live with them taught him that, despite his submission,  his dread of the event had been very great. The weight was removed, and  now he was free to consider his life without reference to the grotesque  intrusion that he had feared. He sighed for joy, and as he paced to and  fro he savoured the scent of the night, which, though it came faintly  to him in that brick-bound suburb, summoned to his mind across many  years the odour of the world at night as he had known it in that short  sojourn of his boyhood; the odour that rose from the earth when the  flame of the sun had gone down beyond the mountain, and the afterglow  had paled in the sky and on the fields. And as he recovered as best he  could these lost dreams of an enchanted land, there came to him other  images of his childhood, forgotten and yet not forgotten, dwelling  unheeded in dark places of the memory, but ready to be summoned forth.  He remembered one fantasy that had long haunted him. As he lay half  asleep in the forest on one hot afternoon of that memorable visit to the  country, he had 'made believe' that a little companion had come to him  out of the blue mists and the green light beneath the leaves--a white  girl with long black hair, who had played with him and whispered her  secrets in his ear, as his father lay sleeping under a tree; and from  that summer afternoon, day by day, she had been beside him; she had  visited him in the wilderness of London, and even in recent years there  had come to him now and again the sense of her presence, in the midst of  the heat and turmoil of the City. The last visit he remembered well; it  was a few weeks before he married, and from the depths of some futile  task he had looked up with puzzled eyes, wondering why the close air  suddenly grew scented with green leaves, why the murmur of the trees and  the wash of the river on the reeds came to his ears; and then that  sudden rapture to which he had given a name and an individuality  possessed him utterly. He knew then how the dull flesh of man can be  like fire; and now, looking back from a new standpoint on this and  other experiences, he realized how all that was real in his life had  been unwelcomed, uncherished by him, had come to him, perhaps, in virtue  of merely negative qualities on his part. And yet, as he reflected, he  saw that there had been a chain of witnesses all through his life: again  and again voices had whispered in his ear words in a strange language  that he now recognized as his native tongue; the common street had not  been lacking in visions of the true land of his birth; and in all the  passing and repassing of the world he saw that there had been emissaries  ready to guide his feet on the way of the great journey.    A week or two after the visit of Mr. Nixon, Darnell took his annual  holiday.    There was no question of Walton-on-the-Naze, or of anything of the kind,  as he quite agreed with his wife's longing for some substantial sum put  by against the evil day. But the weather was still fine, and he lounged  away the time in his garden beneath the tree, or he sauntered out on  long aimless walks in the western purlieus of London, not unvisited by  that old sense of some great ineffable beauty, concealed by the dim and  dingy veils of grey interminable streets. Once, on a day of heavy rain  he went to the 'box-room,' and began to turn over the papers in the old  hair trunk--scraps and odds and ends of family history, some of them in  his father's handwriting, others in faded ink, and there were a few  ancient pocket-books, filled with manuscript of a still earlier time,  and in these the ink was glossier and blacker than any writing fluids  supplied by stationers of later days. Darnell had hung up the portrait  of the ancestor in this room, and had bought a solid kitchen table and  a chair; so that Mrs. Darnell, seeing him looking over his old  documents, half thought of naming the room 'Mr. Darnell's study.' He had  not glanced at these relics of his family for many years, but from the  hour when the rainy morning sent him to them, he remained constant to  research till the end of the holidays. It was a new interest, and he  began to fashion in his mind a faint picture of his forefathers, and of  their life in that grey old house in the river valley, in the western  land of wells and streams and dark and ancient woods. And there were  stranger things than mere notes on family history amongst that odd  litter of old disregarded papers, and when he went back to his work in  the City some of the men fancied that he was in some vague manner  changed in appearance; but he only laughed when they asked him where he  had been and what he had been doing with himself. But Mary noticed that  every evening he spent at least an hour in the box-room; she was rather  sorry at the waste of time involved in reading old papers about dead  people. And one afternoon, as they were out together on a somewhat  dreary walk towards Acton, Darnell stopped at a hopeless second-hand  bookshop, and after scanning the rows of shabby books in the window,  went in and purchased two volumes. They proved to be a Latin dictionary  and grammar, and she was surprised to hear her husband declare his  intention of acquiring the Latin language.    But, indeed, all his conduct impressed her as indefinably altered; and  she began to be a little alarmed, though she could scarcely have formed  her fears in words. But she knew that in some way that was all  indefined and beyond the grasp of her thought their lives had altered  since the summer, and no single thing wore quite the same aspect as  before. If she looked out into the dull street with its rare loiterers,  it was the same and yet it had altered, and if she opened the window in  the early morning the wind that entered came with a changed breath that  spoke some message that she could not understand. And day by day passed  by in the old course, and not even the four walls were altogether  familiar, and the voices of men and women sounded with strange notes,  with the echo, rather, of a music that came over unknown hills. And day  by day as she went about her household work, passing from shop to shop  in those dull streets that were a network, a fatal labyrinth of grey  desolation on every side, there came to her sense half-seen images of  some other world, as if she walked in a dream, and every moment must  bring her to light and to awakening, when the grey should fade, and  regions long desired should appear in glory. Again and again it seemed  as if that which was hidden would be shown even to the sluggish  testimony of sense; and as she went to and fro from"]]]
