A most ridiculous account  is given of their goddess of riches. When a mortal, she had no  children by her husband, which caused her to supplicate the gods to  give her offspring. Her prayers were heard, and she produced five  hundred eggs. Being afraid that if the eggs were hatched they would  bring forth monsters, she packed them up in a box bearing a particular  mark, and threw them into a river. An old fisherman found the box,  and, seeing it full of eggs, carried it home to his wife. Not having a  sufficient number of hens to hatch so many eggs, she put them into an  oven, and, to the surprise of the aged couple, every egg produced a  child. The two old people succeeded in bringing up the strange progeny  to manhood, for they were all sons. They became robbers and beggars by  turn; and it happened, one day during their rambles, that they came to  their mother's house. From inquiries she made, it became clear that  the young ruffians were her own children. She kept them, and reared  them up to be virtuous and useful. She was afterwards taken up from  the earth to be among the gods, where she remains, attended by her  five hundred sons.    Apes and monkeys, as well as other creatures, were worshipped in  Japan. So great faith did the people of that country put in the  transmigration of souls, that they had hospitals for the reception of  animals in whose bodies souls were supposed to reside. In a wood near  Jeddo there were many sacred animals, daily fed by priests. These  animals, the priests said, were animated by the souls of the most  noble and illustrious heroes that ever lived. The people had such a  profound veneration for stags, that they were to be seen in every  street as numerous as the dogs in our country. If one killed a stag,  not only was he condemned to die, but the houses where the deed was  committed were razed to the ground. Dogs were held in great esteem.  The inhabitants of every street were obliged to support a fixed number  of them, they being quartered on the people like so many soldiers.  When a dog died, it was buried among human remains. A man who killed a  canine creature was punished with death. Fish were looked upon as  sacred. Near the capital was a river that was so plentifully stocked  with fish, that they thrust one another ashore, yet not one of them  was injured. The people believed that if they touched one of the finny  tribe, they would be smitten with leprosy, and it was considered an  unpardonable sin to eat any of them. A belief prevailed, that fish  possessed the souls of naval officers. Statues of witches, magicians,  and devils find places in the Japan temples.    Charms were sold by the priests, which were represented to possess the  virtue of curing diseases and driving away the devil. Money was  sometimes borrowed on security of charms, not to be repaid in this  world. A note was given, authorizing payment of the money in the land  of spirits; and when the holder of the document died, his relations  put it into his hand, believing that the debt would be duly paid to  the deceased. The Japanese thought certain days were more fortunate  than others. A table of their fortunate and unfortunate days was hung  up in the passage of every house, for the guidance of the family when  they went out. This table of days was prepared by a celebrated  astrologer of universal knowledge in all mysteries, whether relating  to the stars, dreams, or omens. Like other men of note in the East, he  was born in a miraculous manner. His father was a prince, and his  mother a fox. It appears that the lady fox being pursued by huntsmen,  ran to and obtained protection from his highness. The creature  discovered herself to be a fairy, and, throwing off her false  appearance, became a beautiful princess. The prince being enamoured  with her charms, married her, and had by her the celebrated astrologer  spoken of. When he grew up he invented a set of mysterious terms,  which he comprised within the compass of one verse, as a charm or  protection for such persons as were compelled to work on unlucky days;  and every one who repeated the verse reverently on the morning of an  unlucky day, was preserved from all the evils that would have  otherwise befallen him.          THE GODS AND GODDESSES OF HEATHEN NATIONS.      CHAPTER IX.          The Classification of Gods and Goddesses--Primeval        Parent Chaos--Creation--Influence of Ether--The Human        Race in danger of Perishing--Celestial Fire--Birth of        Cupid--Banishment of Cupid from the Blest        Abodes--Cupid's Armour--Fate--Eternal Decrees--Throne        of Jove--Fortune and Happiness--Misfortune and        Misery--Twofold Nature--Rewards and Punishments--First        Man and Woman--Pan the Emblem of all Things--Power of        Heathen Gods--Descriptions of Juno--Venus the Goddess        of Love and Beauty--Rustics turned into        Frogs--Vulcan--AEolus--Momus the Jester--The Carping        God's Fault-finding--Improper Position of the Bull's        Horns--Minerva as a House--Window in Man's Breast.      We do not intend to notice at great length the ancient opinions and  writings concerning the deities which heathen nations thought presided  over the world and the heavens, and influenced the affairs of the  spheres above and below; but as much of comparatively modern  superstition has been traced to mythology, generally so called, we  cannot pass without observation the history of the gods, nor avoid  giving such extracts therefrom as bear particularly on our subject,  \"The Collected Mysteries of all Nations.\"    The gods and goddesses of heathen nations were classified as  follows:--1st, the celestial gods and goddesses; 2nd, the terrestrial  deities; 3rd, the marine and river gods and goddesses; 4th, the  infernal gods; 5th, the subordinate and miscellaneous deities; 6th,  the ascriptious gods, demigods, and heroes; and 7th, the modal  deities. Ancient writers speak thus:    \"When the primeval parent Chaos, hoary with unnumbered ages, was first  moved by the breath of Erebus, she brought forth her enormous  first-born Hyle, and at the same portentous birth the amiable almighty  Eros, chief of the immortals. They had no sooner come to light than  they produced the terrible Titans.\"    Again we are informed that--\"Ere the universe appeared; ere the sun  mounted on high, or the moon gave her pale light; ere the vales were  stretched out below, or the mountains reared their towering heads; ere  the winds began to blow, or the rivers to flow, or plants or trees had  sprung from the earth; while the heavens lay hid in the mighty mass,  and the stars were unknown, the various parts of which the wondrous  creation consists lay jumbled without form in the Abyss of Being.\"  There, it is said, they had lain for ever and ever if the breath of  the terrible Erebus, the spirit that dwelt in eternal darkness, had  not gone forth and put the mass into vital agitation.    From another source we learn that, first of all, Chaos existed; next  in order the broad Earth; and then Love appeared, the most beautiful  of all things. Of Chaos sprang Erebus and dusty Night, and of Erebus  and Night came Ether and smiling Day.    The Earth conceived by the influence of Ether, and brought forth man  and every description of animal. The human race was in danger of  perishing from the face of earth. Naked, needy, and ignorant, they  passed their dreary days, living in caves and lurking in woods like  wild beasts. They were alike destitute of laws and arts. Their food  consisted of herbs. Often were they compelled to fly before the  mountain tigers and bears of the forest, while they were nearly frozen  to death. Thus they lived in wretchedness until Prometheus came to  their relief. He called Pallas, the goddess of wisdom, to his aid. By  her assistance he mounted to heaven, where he secretly held the reed  he carried in his hand to the wheel of the sun's chariot. In this way  he obtained the celestial fire, and conveyed it to Earth, where he  presented it to man. Prometheus did not stop here: he instructed man  in arts and industry of almost every description.    There is an interesting account of Cupid. The goddess of beauty, we  are informed, brought forth a delicate infant, whom she gave to the  Graces to nurse. Unhappily, the child neither throve in person, nor  put forth feathers to cover the wings which he had. Under this  affliction, Cupid's mother and nurses had recourse to the most ancient  and infallible Themis, who gave this answer: That love came, for the  most part, single into the world, but that the child would not thrive  until his mother brought forth another son. Then the one would thrive  in virtue of the other; but if the one died, the other could not long  survive. Venus brought forth another son, Anteros. He no sooner came  into being, than his elder brother Cupid grew, and his wings were soon  fledged. So strong did the little urchin become, that he flew to  heaven. There he associated with the Muses, became intimate with  Mercury, kept company with Hymen, and grew in favour with every one  except the implacable Momus. Unfortunately, Cupid became insolent and  vain, behaving with arrogance to the superior powers. He made enmity  reign where peace and concord should have been found. Feuds raged  among the gods and goddesses on his account. To rid themselves of a  pest, the rulers of heaven called an assembly of the gods, to consider  how peace could be restored. Cupid was accused of being a public  incendiary, a disturber of good order; and the fomenter of discord  being found guilty, he was banished from the blest abodes; ordered to  be a retainer of Ceres and Bacchus on earth; and doomed to have his  wings stripped of their feathers, that he might not again infest the  confines of heaven.    Cupid is now armed with two bows, one of which he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#17)"],[1,"ll, to his  disappointments.    \"Kirtley, you are always a lucky dog. Here you are with nice Dutch  people, in the social swim, absorbing German to beat the band. All I  see is chambermaids who shout at me some kind of devilish dialect  that a fellow can't understand. And my chambermaid and I are just at  present at outs. I told her this morning she was the tallest woman I  ever saw. A little of her went such a long ways. As she don't know  any English words, that is the only thing we have agreed about. She  said, Ja wohl! This going to balls and cafes as I'm doing is all  right for local color and all that, but it would tickle dad a lot if  I knew a quiet, decent, respectable German family. And I want to  know a nice, sober German girl who has got yellow, chorus-girl hair  and will steady a fellow down. The proper study of young man is  young woman. I haven't been able to meet any young ladies in this  country. Sometimes I think they have only wenches. And I want some  of the classic Gayty and Schiller stuff too that you can get here in  Loschwitz.\"    This urgent idea did not appear auspicious to Gard. If Deming got  the run of Villa Elsa, he would unsettle things, interfere with his  own work. Jim was a good boy but he played hob with study. And he  was just the kind of flashy, ignorant Yankee who would prove to  Villa Elsa what it claimed about the race. He would disgust the  Buchers with his showy superficiality and dolessness. Mere money,  everlasting money. More than all he would complicate the situation  with Fraeulein. He might upset her somehow, and at least discover his  own secret feelings toward her--feelings that had become more  distraught after the Von Tielitz revelation. In a word, everything  would be helter-skelter.    After Jim had called twice, bent upon becoming intimate with the  Buchers, Gard, as he thought, conceived a clever maneuver. He took  Deming over to call on Fraeulein Wasserhaus. Here was an earnest  young woman, lolling on the gate with plenty of time on her hands,  dying for a man. She could teach Deming everything he wanted to  know. She was not antagonistic to Americans as were the Buchers. On  the contrary she was aching to clasp some one of them in her pudgy  arms.    But this stratagem proved a flat failure. When they came away from  her abode, Jim took on a worried look and lit a cigarette.    \"Say, see here, old chap. Are you trying to make fun of me? Is this  a joke? I don't want a walrus, thirty years old, with ragbag clothes  that fit her a foot off. She has a gait like an ice wagon. Why, she  couldn't get a job as window-washer in the street car shops of Erie,  Pay.\"          CHAPTER XX    AN AMERICAN VICTORY      Deming's campaign against the terrible German language was unable to  advance perceptibly beyond the stage of preparations. These were  somewhat elaborate, especially from the standpoint of expense. He  had a multiplicity of instructors and grammars. If they had been  placed side by side they might have reached from the Green Vault to  the Zwinger.    He blamed these agencies of instruction. His \"professors\" he  generally picked up at the Stadt Gotha where he played billiards.  While these parties were fair with the ivories, they could not seem  to knock any caroms of German around the cushions of Jim's brain.    His daily routine was like this: At ten, his lesson in Dutch.  Teacher would come. Great show of hospitality. There must be  something to drink. The preceptor must try one of the fancy pipes,  of which Deming had collected a large array in Germany. He would be  feeling knocked in this morning, having been up late consuming  numerous bocks in amicable emulation of the local prowess. He had  not got around to his lesson and had concluded he did not think much  of his present grammar. Herr Preceptor would suggest procuring  another which would strew roses no doubt along the thorny path.  Capital idea. Of course they must then wait for the new grammar.    Adjournment at eleven to the cafe for billiards. Deming was a good  wielder of the cue. He said the Germans were too be-spectacled and  blear-eyed to play well and by three o'clock he had usually won  quite a number of marks. This was making \"easy money.\" It went  toward paying for his evening's entertainment and was good economy.  His pleasure account would not look so large to his governor. At  three, to his hotel for afternoon dress. Evenings it was some other  form of diversion. Home at all hours.    This was his day of study, of which his hopeful parents learned the  promising side. Someone advised him that if he did not try so hard  to master German, it would come easier. But he experimented with  this plan for a week and told Gard:    \"When you don't bone over the blamed language, it's surprising how  much you don't know about it. It still takes me an hour and a half  to hold a five minutes' conversation.\"    In two months he was thumbing page ten of the grammar, but he had  seized upon a good many slang phrases, supercharged ejaculations.  Though the undercurrent of his discouragement about his progress was  considerable, it interfered little with his acquainting him  proficiently with the restaurant world of Dresden. He saw and heard  what was going on in those quarters, and through him Kirtley learned  of that phase of German character and habits.    In view of everything, there had finally been no decent, reasonable  way for Gard but to let Deming, professedly zealous of knowing  German and seeing Teuton home life, into the Bucher circle. Aware  that Jim was quite innocent enough morally, Gard avoided introducing  him to Von Tielitz and Messer whose depravities might prove  harmful. But Deming at last met the former at Loschwitz and the two  became friends just before Friedrich left in quest of another  Kapellmeistership. The friction or explosion Gard rather expected  between them over Fraeulein did not occur. While he had dreaded such  a happening for Jim's sake, it might have cleared the atmosphere  pleasantly for his own. But Friedrich was delighted that Herr Deming  showed his old neighbors, the Buchers, such munificent courtesies,  and Jim thought Von Tielitz the most brilliant chap he had ever  known.    Kirtley waited with fear, with trembling and also with some hopeful  interest, for the fireworks resulting from Deming's induction to  Villa Elsa. And they promptly began to soar, for Jim had, in his  way, all the American speed, and proceeded to overwhelm the  household with his attentions. It was a case of swift enthusiasm  about the whole family. Unlike Kirtley he did not care how many of  the members accompanied the Fraeulein and him. All were welcome.  Though he openly displayed his fascination about the Fraeulein, it  had none of that tender sentiment which Gard was dissembling before  his friend. Nevertheless it appeared to be a violent case of love at  first sight, and before the first sight.    Kirtley dropped out of the running. He excused himself by the  necessity of burying himself deeper in his books on Teuton origins  and traits. In a brief week the Buchers had forgotten him. All was  Herr Deming--the wonderful Herr Deming--the fortunate youth who was  bringing the witchery of good luck into the drab home. It was Herr  Deming morning, noon and night.    There were theater parties, suppers on Bruehl Terrace, plans for the  next dance. Jim spread it on thick, and the dutiful, docile Elsa was  swept along with the rest, although with a reserve in evocation as  became the modesty of a maiden who was manifestly the pivotal center  of all this vertiginous attraction and activity. The Buchers  suddenly evinced a great and favorable curiosity about America.  Their attitude toward it was revolutionized. They plied Gard with  questions. What was living like there? It must be most desirable.  Gard came across convenient hand books of knowledge, inconvenient  encyclopedias and atlases, lying here and there in the house, with  pages opened freely at the United States. Frau Bucher became  vociferous in praise of the advantages of the Yankee fashion of  courtship over the slow, economical, dull, German process of  match-making.    The household was overturned. Its affairs got dreadfully behind.  Mother was mightily absorbed in getting out and fixing up imposing  old dresses, laces, wraps, that were heirlooms or dated from her  bridal days of a quarter of a century before. Elsa's lessons in  etching and her methodical hours for perfecting her manifold  talents, became badly confused.    The great thing was driving at the fashionable hour in the Grosse  Garten. This was what the Buchers had never dreamed of. In the  winter only the royal and very aristocratic families drove there.  The common people, who might extravagantly expend a few marks to  indulge in this pastime of nobility in summer, were frozen out of it  in winter. Hot drinks in beer halls were then more to their taste.    But many an afternoon at four Deming, with his two ladies  overdressed for the occasion in the dowdy German manner, occupying  a handsome, heated limousine decorated with a conspicuous mirror and  with Parma violets gently disengaging a delicate perfume, fell in  right behind the king's household if possible, and toured the park  in stately measure, being numbered, no doubt, by the open-mouthed  beholder on the sidewalk, among the social elect in Saxony.    Elsa was as good as engaged, as good as married. In her mother's  eyes, bloodshot with all this glory of excitement, her daughter was  already dwelling in a palace in that amazing city of Erie, in that  splendid commonwealth of Pennsylvania, of whose double fame she had  never before heard. For, of course, Deming sang constantly of the  wonders of his native haunts, where wealth flowed out of the ground  and the trolley system was the best in the world.    Thus the Americanization of Villa Elsa was accomplished in the  twinkling of an eye. No more"]]]
