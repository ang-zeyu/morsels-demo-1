[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22217"],[0,"My Reminiscences (#17)"],[1,"put me on to translate \"The Vicar of  Wakefield.\" I found that I did not dislike the book; but when this  encouraged him to make more elaborate arrangements for the advancement  of my learning I made myself altogether scarce.    As I have said, my elders gave me up. Neither I nor they were troubled  with any more hopes of my future. So I felt free to devote myself to  filling up my manuscript book. And the writings which thus filled it  were no better than could have been expected. My mind had nothing in it  but hot vapour, and vapour-filled bubbles frothed and eddied round a  vortex of lazy fancy, aimless and unmeaning. No forms were evolved,  there was only the distraction of movement, a bubbling up, a bursting  back into froth. What little of matter there was in it was not mine, but  borrowed from other poets. What was my own was the restlessness, the  seething tension within me. When motion has been born, while yet the  balance of forces has not matured, then is there blind chaos indeed.    My sister-in-law[35] was a great lover of literature. She did not read  simply to kill time, but the Bengali books which she read filled her  whole mind. I was a partner in her literary enterprises. She was a  devoted admirer of \"The Dream Journey.\" So was I; the more particularly  as, having been brought up in the atmosphere of its creation, its  beauties had become intertwined with every fibre of my heart.  Fortunately it was entirely beyond my power of imitation, so it never  occurred to me to attempt anything like it.    \"The Dream Journey\" may be likened to a superb palace of Allegory, with  innumerable halls, chambers, passages, corners and niches full of  statuary and pictures, of wonderful design and workmanship; and in the  grounds around gardens, bowers, fountains and shady nooks in profusion.  Not only do poetic thought and fancy abound, but the richness and  variety of language and expression is also marvellous. It is not a small  thing, this creative power which can bring into being so magnificent a  structure complete in all its artistic detail, and that is perhaps why  the idea of attempting an imitation never occurred to me.    At this time Viharilal Chakravarti's series of songs called _Sarada  Mangal_ were coming out in the _Arya Darsan_. My sister-in-law was  greatly taken with the sweetness of these lyrics. Most of them she knew  by heart. She used often to invite the poet to our house and had  embroidered for him a cushion-seat with her own hands. This gave me the  opportunity of making friends with him. He came to have a great  affection for me, and I took to dropping in at his house at all times of  the day, morning, noon or evening. His heart was as large as his body,  and a halo of fancy used to surround him like a poetic astral body which  seemed to be his truer image. He was always full of true artistic joy,  and whenever I have been to him I have breathed in my share of it. Often  have I come upon him in his little room on the third storey, in the heat  of noonday, sprawling on the cool polished cement floor, writing his  poems. Mere boy though I was, his welcome was always so genuine and  hearty that I never felt the least awkwardness in approaching him. Then,  wrapt in his inspiration and forgetful of all surroundings, he would  read out his poems or sing his songs to me. Not that he had much of the  gift of song in his voice; but then he was not altogether tuneless, and  one could get a fair idea of the intended melody.[36] When with eyes  closed he raised his rich deep voice, its expressiveness made up for  what it lacked in execution. I still seem to hear some of his songs as  he sang them. I would also sometimes set his words to music and sing  them to him.    He was a great admirer of Valmiki and Kalidas. I remember how once after  reciting a description of the Himalayas from Kalidas with the full  strength of his voice, he said: \"The succession of long [=a] sounds here  is not an accident. The poet has deliberately repeated this sound all  the way from _Devatatma_ down to _Nagadhiraja_ as an assistance in  realising the glorious expanse of the Himalayas.\"    At the time the height of my ambition was to become a poet like Vihari  Babu. I might have even succeeded in working myself up to the belief  that I was actually writing like him, but for my sister-in-law, his  zealous devotee, who stood in the way. She would keep reminding me of a  Sanskrit saying that the unworthy aspirant after poetic fame departs in  jeers! Very possibly she knew that if my vanity was once allowed to get  the upper hand it would be difficult afterwards to bring it under  control. So neither my poetic abilities nor my powers of song readily  received any praise from her; rather would she never let slip an  opportunity of praising somebody else's singing at my expense; with the  result that I gradually became quite convinced of the defects of my  voice. Misgivings about my poetic powers also assailed me; but, as this  was the only field of activity left in which I had any chance of  retaining my self-respect, I could not allow the judgment of another to  deprive me of all hope; moreover, so insistent was the spur within me  that to stop my poetic adventure was a matter of sheer impossibility.          (20) _Publishing_      My writings so far had been confined to the family circle. Then was  started the monthly called the _Gyanankur_, Sprouting Knowledge, and, as  befitted its name it secured an embryo poet as one of its contributors.  It began to publish all my poetic ravings indiscriminately, and to this  day I have, in a corner of my mind, the fear that, when the day of  judgment comes for me, some enthusiastic literary police-agent will  institute a search in the inmost zenana of forgotten literature,  regardless of the claims of privacy, and bring these out before the  pitiless public gaze.    My first prose writing also saw the light in the pages of the  _Gyanankur_. It was a critical essay and had a bit of a history.    A book of poems had been published entitled _Bhubanmohini Pratibha_.[37]  Akshay Babu in the _Sadharani_ and Bhudeb Babu in the _Education  Gazette_ hailed this new poet with effusive acclamation. A friend of  mine, older than myself, whose friendship dates from then, would come  and show me letters he had received signed _Bhubanmohini_. He was one of  those whom the book had captivated and used frequently to send  reverential offerings of books or cloth[38] to the address of the  reputed authoress.    Some of these poems were so wanting in restraint both of thought and  language that I could not bear the idea of their being written by a  woman. The letters that were shown to me made it still less possible for  me to believe in the womanliness of the writer. But my doubts did not  shake my friend's devotion and he went on with the worship of his idol.    Then I launched into a criticism of the work of this writer. I let  myself go, and eruditely held forth on the distinctive features of  lyrics and other short poems, my great advantage being that printed  matter is so unblushing, so impassively unbetraying of the writer's real  attainments. My friend turned up in a great passion and hurled at me the  threat that a B.A. was writing a reply. A B.A.! I was struck  speechless. I felt the same as in my younger days when my nephew Satya  had shouted for a policeman. I could see the triumphal pillar of  argument, erected upon my nice distinctions, crumbling before my eyes at  the merciless assaults of authoritative quotations; and the door  effectually barred against my ever showing my face to the reading public  again. Alas, my critique, under what evil star wert thou born! I spent  day after day in the direst suspense. But, like Satya's policeman, the  B.A. failed to appear.          (21) _Bhanu Singha_      As I have said I was a keen student of the series of old Vaishnava poems  which were being collected and published by Babus Akshay Sarkar and  Saroda Mitter. Their language, largely mixed with Maithili, I found  difficult to understand; but for that very reason I took all the more  pains to get at their meaning. My feeling towards them was that same  eager curiosity with which I regarded the ungerminated sprout within  the seed, or the undiscovered mystery under the dust covering of the  earth. My enthusiasm was kept up with the hope of bringing to light some  unknown poetical gems as I went deeper and deeper into the unexplored  darkness of this treasure-house.    While I was so engaged, the idea got hold of me of enfolding my own  writings in just such a wrapping of mystery. I had heard from Akshay  Chowdhury the story of the English boy-poet Chatterton. What his poetry  was like I had no idea, nor perhaps had Akshay Babu himself. Had we  known, the story might have lost its charm. As it happened the  melodramatic element in it fired my imagination; for had not so many  been deceived by his successful imitation of the classics? And at last  the unfortunate youth had died by his own hand. Leaving aside the  suicide part I girded up my loins to emulate young Chatterton's  exploits.    One noon the clouds had gathered thickly. Rejoicing in the grateful  shade of the cloudy midday rest-hour, I lay prone on the bed in my inner  room and wrote on a slate the imitation _Maithili_ poem _Gahana kusuma  kunja majhe_. I was greatly pleased with it and lost no time in reading  it out to the first one I came across; of whose understanding a word of  it there happened to be not the slightest danger, and who consequently  could not but gravely nod and say, \"Good, very good indeed!\"    To my friend mentioned a while ago I said one day: \"A tattered old  manuscript has been discovered while rummaging in the _Adi Brahma Samaj_  library and from this I have copied some poems by an old Vaishnava Poet  named Bhanu Singha;\"[39] with which I read some of my imitation poems to  him. He was profoundly stirred.

An hour later a cloud of dust  was seen rising to the south-west, and in a few minutes the sheik, with  fifty followers, rode up.    \"What is the news?\" he asked his son as he leapt from his horse. \"We  heard that the people of Cairo are about to rise against the Franks, and  numbers of our people have already ridden to join them in the attack.\"    \"The city is in a very disturbed state, father, but as yet the rising  has not begun.\"    \"That is good, my son. We were unable to strike a blow at the Franks in  the battle here; this time we will do our share, with the aid of Allah.    \"You do not think that that is well?\" he broke off as he glanced at  Edgar.    \"It is for you to decide, sheik,\" Edgar said. \"For my part, I do not  believe that the rising will be successful. It is true that a large  number of the French are absent. Desaix has gone with his division to  capture the northern provinces and drive out Mourad Bey and the  Mamelukes. Kleber marched yesterday, they say, to Damietta, but there is  still a strong force here. I doubt not that the rising will be  successful at first. Many French soldiers away from their regiments will  be cut down and killed, detached parties may be attacked and  overpowered, but I believe that in the end their discipline will  triumph. Their cannon will sweep the streets, the guns of the citadel  and the new forts that they have armed will shell the town; and  although, if a really desperate defence is made, the town can hardly be  captured without great loss, Bonaparte is sure to do so sooner or later,  for, if necessary, he can call back Kleber and Desaix. It is a matter of  life and death to them. Were the country to hear that Cairo had been  recovered and the French driven out with heavy loss, there would be a  rush to arms. The army would, I believe, be able to fight its way down  to Alexandria, but when beleaguered there, unable to obtain any stores  from the country round, and their retreat from sea cut off, their  position would be desperate.\"    \"I do not say that you are not right,\" the sheik said gravely. \"You  understand the mode of warfare of these Franks much better than I do,  and have been right in all your predictions of what would happen; but  whatever may be the danger, it is clear to me that it must be faced.  Brave men do not shrink from encountering death, and how can a follower  of the Prophet shrink from death in battle with infidels. Numbers of my  countrymen will assuredly take part in the struggle, and did I ride away  without sharing in the conflict, I should not be able to lift up my head  again. It may be that it is fated that I shall not return; so be it; if  it is the will of Allah that I should die now, who am I to oppose it?    \"Let there be no more said on this. I know, my friend, that you are not  afraid of danger, and that your counsel is not prompted by any thought  of personal fear. I acknowledge that all you say may come to pass, but  my mind is made up. Thousands of Arabs will fight there, and I shall not  draw back. Sidi will, of course, fight by my side, but it is not your  quarrel, and there is no reason why you should risk your life in a  struggle that you believe to be hopeless.\"    \"Assuredly, chief, I shall ride with you. You have treated me as one of  your tribe, and I have come to regard myself as such. Sidi is as my  brother, and were there no other reason, I would ride to battle by his  side. Moreover, this is as much my business as yours. My country is at  war with France, and if at present Egypt is invaded by them, it is not  because France desires to capture Egypt, but because by their occupation  of the country they hope to strike a blow at England.\"    \"It is well!\" the chief said. \"I think not that either you or Sidi will  fall. Allah sent you to his aid when he was in danger, and he would  hardly have done so had it been his will that you should both perish so  shortly afterwards; but we are all in His hands, and shall die when our  time comes, and not before.\"    Then, as if dismissing the subject, he asked Sidi what had happened in  the town, and whether they had been questioned by any as to their  business.    \"The principal thing, father, that has happened to us is, that we again  met the two men who attacked me at Alexandria, and were beaten and  turned out of the city, and as it happened then, I should have lost my  life had it not been for my brother.\"    \"Tell me about it,\" the sheik said, his face hardening and his fingers  playing with the hilt of the long knife in his sash.    Sidi related the whole adventure.    The sheik stood stroking his beard gravely as Sidi spoke. His eyes  turned from his son to Edgar.    \"Bishmillah!\" he exclaimed, when the story was finished, \"Allah must  have sent you to be Sidi's protector. Without doubt, he would have lost  his life had he been alone. Truly it is a wonderful thing this English  science that you possess, and that enables you, though but a lad, to  knock down strong men, and although unused to a knife, to slay ruffians  accustomed to it from their childhood, with their own weapons. More than  ever am I beholden to you, Edgar. Twice have you saved my son's life.  Had you been alone, these men would not have recognized you, and it was  but because he was attacked that, as on the last occasion, you joined in  the fray. Show me, I beg you, how you slew this man.\"    \"It was simple, sheik. Had I fought him in his own fashion he would, I  have no doubt, have killed me. But my method was as new to him as his  would have been to me. Will you draw your dagger and advance at me as if  going to strike? Now, if I have my knife in my right hand also, you  know what to do; you would try to grasp my wrist with your left hand. I  should try to grasp yours in the same way. We should struggle, but with  your superior strength you would soon wrench your right hand free, and  strike me down. Now, you see, I take my closed knife in my left hand,  pointing it straight towards you, with my left foot forward; that is the  position in which we stand when we use our fists. You, like that  Maltese, are puzzled, and stand, as he did, for a moment indecisive;  that would have been fatal to you. As, you see, I leap forward, changing  my advanced foot as I do so, catch your wrist, and pull your arm with a  sudden jerk towards me, and at the same moment strike you under the arm  with my left hand.\"    An exclamation of wonder broke from the Arabs standing round listening  to the conversation, as with lightning speed Edgar repeated the  manoeuvre that had been fatal to the Maltese.    \"Bishmillah,\" the chief ejaculated, \"but it is wonderful! It is true I  should have been a dead man had your blade been opened, and your  movement was so rapid that I could not have avoided it.\"    \"No, because you were not accustomed to it. Had you been an English  boxer you would have leapt back as quickly as I leapt forward. I should  have failed to grasp your wrist, and should in that case have leapt back  again to my former position, for had I remained thus I should have been  at your mercy. Had I succeeded in doing so before you struck me, we  should have been as we began, and I should have tried some other trick.  Certainly as long as I stood with my left arm extended and my knife  pointed towards you, you could not have closed with me--for I am much  quicker on my feet from the training that I have received--and I could  have got back more quickly than your knife could fall, and even if the  blades fell at the same moment you would but gash my shoulder, whereas I  should pierce you at a vital point.    \"It is with this as with other matters. You have been trained from  childhood to sit your horse. You can stoop over while you are galloping  at full speed and pick up a stone from the sand. You can twirl your  lance round your head and throw it into the air, and catch it as it  descends while going at full speed. You can do things that no untrained  Englishman could do. So is it with me. I have learned boxing from the  best masters in England, I have practised daily for two years and a  half, and I have gained a quickness that could not be imitated by one  who has not had such teaching and practice.\"    \"It is true,\" the sheik said. \"But it is not the less wonderful in our  eyes that, though knowing the use of our weapons, we should be but as  children in your hands when thus fighting on foot. I wonder no longer  that you should so easily have conquered this man. What say you, my  brothers?\"    An exclamation of assent broke from the Arabs, who, in spite of Edgar's  explanation, henceforth regarded him with an almost superstitious  respect. As soon as the troop had arrived, Edgar had gone to see his  horse, which, as well as that of Sidi, the sheik had brought with him.  It had whinnied with pleasure as he came up to it, and he stood patting  it for some time, and giving it some dates. He now went over to it  again, and on his return asked the chief:    \"Were you thinking of riding that splendid horse of yours?\"    \"Certainly I was,\" he replied, in a tone of surprise.    \"I do not mean to take mine,\" Edgar said, \"and I think that it would be  a great pity if you and Sidi were to ride yours. I can understand that,  in a fight on the plains, it would be a great advantage to be so  mounted, for either in pursuit or flight it would be invaluable, but in  the narrow streets of Cairo it would be a sin to risk so splendid an  animal, and the one I have been riding would be just as useful. We shall  be fighting, not against cavalry, but against infantry and artillery,  and it would be useless to ride a horse that would outstrip those of the  rest of the band; while even if we won the day our satisfaction would be  lessened indeed had one to mourn the loss of one's friend.\"  "]]]
