Meat and food in plenty was there every day,  and at fairs and other junketings the tables did wellnigh break with  what they bore. Then drank they wine as it were water, then did a man  fill his belly and carry away withal as much as he could; then was  wealth and plenty. Otherwise is it now. A costly and a bad time hath  arisen since many a year, and the food and drink of the best peasant  is much worse than of yore that of the day labourer and the serving  man.\"    We may well imagine the vivid recollections which a peasant in the  year 1525 had of the golden days of a few years before. The day  labourers and serving men were equally tantalized by the remembrance  of high wages and cheap living at the beginning of the century. A day  labourer could then earn, with his keep, nine, and without keep,  sixteen groschen[15] a week. What this would buy may be judged from  the following prices current in Saxony during the second half of the  fifteenth century. A pair of good working-shoes cost three groschen; a  whole sheep, four groschen; a good fat hen, half a groschen;  twenty-five cod-fish, four groschen; a wagon-load of firewood,  together with carriage, five groschen; an ell of the best homespun  cloth, five groschen; a scheffel (about a bushel) of rye, six or seven  groschen. The Duke of Saxony wore grey hats which cost him four  groschen. In Northern Rhineland about the same time a day labourer  could, in addition to his keep, earn in a week a quarter of rye, ten  pounds of pork, six large cans of milk, and two bundles of firewood,  and in the course of five weeks be able to buy six ells of linen, a  pair of shoes, and a bag for his tools. In Augsburg the daily wages of  an ordinary labourer represented the value of six pounds of the best  meat, or one pound of meat, seven eggs, a peck of peas, about a quart  of wine, in addition to such bread as he required, with enough over  for lodging, clothing, and minor expenses. In Bavaria he could earn  daily eighteen pfennige, or one and a half groschen, whilst a pound of  sausage cost one pfennig, and a pound of the best beef two pfennige,  and similarly throughout the whole of the States of Central Europe.    A document of the year 1483, from Ehrbach in the Swabian Odenwald,  describes for us the treatment of servants by their masters. \"All  journeymen,\" it declares, \"that are hired, and likewise bondsmen  (serfs), also the serving men and maids, shall each day be given twice  meat and what thereto longith, with half a small measure of wine, save  on fast days, when they shall have fish or other food that nourisheth.  Whoso in the week hath toiled shall also on Sundays and feast days  make merry after mass and preaching. They shall have bread and meat  enough, and half a great measure of wine. On feast days also roasted  meat enough. Moreover, they shall be given, to take home with them, a  great loaf of bread and so much of flesh as two at one meal may eat.\"    Again, in a bill of fare of the household of Count Joachim von  Oettingen in Bavaria, the journeymen and villeins are accorded in the  morning, soup and vegetables; at midday, soup and meat, with  vegetables, and a bowl of broth or a plate of salted or pickled meat;  at night, soup and meat, carrots, and preserved meat. Even the women  who brought fowls or eggs from the neighbouring villages to the castle  were given for their trouble--if from the immediate vicinity, a plate  of soup with two pieces of bread; if from a greater distance, a  complete meal and a cruse of wine. In Saxony, similarly, the  agricultural journeymen received two meals a day, of four courses  each, besides frequently cheese and bread at other times should they  require it. Not to have eaten meat for a week was the sign of the  direst famine in any district. Warnings are not wanting against the  evils accruing to the common man from his excessive indulgence in  eating and drinking.    Such was the condition of the proletariat in its first inception, that  is, when the mediaeval system of villeinage had begun to loosen and to  allow a proportion of free labourers to insinuate themselves into its  working. How grievous, then, were the complaints when, while wages had  risen either not at all or at most from half a groschen to a groschen,  the price of rye rose from six or seven groschen a bushel to about  five-and-twenty groschen, that of a sheep from four to eighteen  groschen, and all other articles of necessary consumption in a like  proportion![16]    In the Middle Ages, necessaries and such ordinary comforts as were to  be had at all were dirt cheap; while non-necessaries and luxuries,  that is, such articles as had to be imported from afar, were for the  most part at prohibitive prices. With the opening up of the  world-market during the first half of the sixteenth century, this  state of things rapidly changed. Most luxuries in a short time fell  heavily in price, while necessaries rose in a still greater  proportion.    This latter change in the economic conditions of the world exercised  its most powerful effect, however, on the character of the mediaeval  town, which had remained substantially unchanged since the first great  expansion at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the  fourteenth centuries. With the extension of commerce and the opening  up of communications, there began that evolution of the town whose  ultimate outcome was to entirely change the central idea on which the  urban organization was based.    The first requisite for a town, according to modern notions, is  facility of communication with the rest of the world by means of  railways, telegraphs, postal system, and the like. So far has this  gone now that in a new country, for instance, America, the railway,  telegraph lines, etc., are made first, and the towns are then strung  upon them, like beads upon a cord. In the mediaeval town, on the  contrary, communication was quite a secondary matter, and more of a  luxury than a necessity. Each town was really a self-sufficing entity,  both materially and intellectually. The modern idea of a town is that  of a mere local aggregate of individuals, each pursuing a trade or  calling with a view to the world-market at large. Their own locality  or town is no more to them economically than any other part of the  world-market, and very little more in any other respect. The mediaeval  idea of a town, on the contrary, was that of an organization of groups  into one organic whole. Just as the village community was a somewhat  extended family organization, so was, _mutatis mutandis_, the larger  unit, the township or city. Each member of the town organization owed  allegiance and distinct duties primarily to his guild, or immediate  social group, and through this to the larger social group which  constituted the civic society. Consequently, every townsman felt a  kind of _esprit de corps_ with his fellow-citizens, akin to that, say,  which is alleged of the soldiers of the old French \"foreign legion\"  who, being brothers-in-arms, were brothers also in all other  relations. But if every citizen owed duty and allegiance to the town  in its corporate capacity, the town no less owed protection and  assistance, in every department of life, to its individual members.    As in ancient Rome in its earlier history, and as in all other early  urban communities, agriculture necessarily played a considerable part  in the life of most mediaeval towns. Like the villages, they possessed  each its own mark, with its common fields, pastures, and woods. These  were demarcated by various landmarks, crosses, holy images, etc.; and  \"the bounds\" were beaten every year. The wealthier citizens usually  possessed gardens and orchards within the town walls, while each  inhabitant had his share in the communal holding without. The use of  this latter was regulated by the Rath or Council. In fact, the town  life of the Middle Ages was not by any means so sharply differentiated  from rural life as is implied in our modern idea of a town. Even in  the larger commercial towns, such as Frankfurt, Nuernberg, or Augsburg,  it was common to keep cows, pigs, and sheep, and, as a matter of  course, fowls and geese, in large numbers within the precincts of the  town itself. In Frankfurt in 1481 the pigsties in the town had become  such a nuisance that the Rath had to forbid them _in the front_ of the  houses by a formal decree. In Ulm there was a regulation of the  bakers' guild to the effect that no single member should keep more  than twenty-four pigs, and that cows should be confined to their  stalls at night. In Nuernberg in 1475 again, the Rath had to interfere  with the intolerable nuisance of pigs and other farm-yard stock  running about loose in the streets. Even in a town like Muenchen we are  informed that agriculture formed one of the staple occupations of the  inhabitants, while in almost every city the gardeners' or the  wine-growers' guild appears as one of the largest and most  influential.    It is evident that such conditions of life would be impossible with  town-populations even approaching only distantly those of to-day; and,  in fact, when we come to inquire into the size and populousness of  mediaeval German cities, as into those of the classical world of  antiquity, we are at first sight staggered by the smallness of their  proportions. The largest and most populous free Imperial cities in the  fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Nuernberg and Strassburg, numbered  little more than 20,000 resident inhabitants within the walls, a  population rather less than that of (say) many an English country town  at the present time. Such an important place as Frankfurt-am-Main is  stated at the middle of the fifteenth century to have had less than  9,000 inhabitants. At the end of the fifteenth century"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#17)"],[1,"than fifty miles along the  battle front. This trip required two days, and we were never beyond the  sound of the guns.    Our first stop was at the battlefield of La Chipotte, where was fought  one of the most sanguinary of the earlier battles of war, resulting in a  great French victory, but entailing terrific losses on both sides. In  the greater part of this region we saw forests which had been stripped  by shells and the trees of which were only beginning to grow again. In  some places they will never grow, having been stripped of every leaf and  limb and finally burned by the awful gunfire.    The battle of La Chipotte was fought in 1914. Sixty thousand French  drove back a larger army of Germans after several days of fighting. The  French loss was thirty thousand, and no one knows what the German loss  amounted to. The woods are filled with crosses marking burial places,  where often as many as fifty bodies were entombed together. The French  buried their dead separately from the German dead, but the community  graves are all marked in the same way--with a simple cross. Some of  these crosses recite the names of the companies engaged, but few of them  give the names of the dead. Most of them simply record the number of  French or Germans buried beneath.    At a central part of the battlefield the French have erected a handsome  monument, with the following inscription:      \"They have fallen down silently    like a wall.    May their glorious souls guide    us in the coming battles.\"    After leaving the battlefield of La Chipotte, we next reached the  village of Roan Estape. It was full of ruins and practically deserted.  Beyond this village we passed for miles along roads lined on either side  with the crosses which indicate burial places of soldiers. The battle  front here extended for a long distance and the fighting was bloody  along the whole line. Much of this righting was done in the old way,  trench warfare having only just begun.    [Illustration: Battlefield of La Chipotte, Showing Monument and Markers  on Graves.]    Next we came to Baccarat, where nearly all the houses and the cathedral  were utterly wrecked. For twenty miles beyond this town we passed along  the battle front of the Marne, within three miles of where the main  struggle had taken place, and saw everywhere graves and signs of  destruction. It was surprising how the country had begun to resume its  normal aspect and green things begun to take hold again. Our next stop  was Rambevillers, where we had luncheon at the Hotel de la Porte.          XIII.    THE STORY OF GERBEVILLER      After luncheon at Rambevillers, we drove to the famous village of  Gerbeviller--or rather to what is left of it. This little town is talked  of more than any other place in France, and is called the \"Martyr City\".  Its story is one of the most interesting told us, and to me it seemed  one of the most tragic, although the residents of the town all wanted to  talk about it with pride. While on the way to Gerbeviller we had to show  our passes, and it was lucky they were signed by General Joffre, since  nothing else goes so close to the front. We were made to tell where we  were going, how long we meant to stay, and what route we would take  coming back.    Prefect Mirman, of the Department of Meurthe and Moselle, one of the  most noted and most useful men in France, escorted the commission on  this trip.    Gerbeviller is located near the junction of the valleys of Meurthe and  Moselle, and occupied a strategic situation at the beginning of the war.  This and the heroic defense made of the bridge by a little company of  French soldiers, was, the French believe, responsible for its barbarous  treatment by the Germans. In the other ruined towns the destruction was  wrought by shell fire. Here the Germans went from house to house with  torches and burned the buildings after resistance had ceased and they  were in full possession of the town. The French say it was done in  wanton revenge and it looks as if that were true. Here is the story as  it was told to us in eager French and interpreted for us by one of the  party.    A bridge leading from the town crosses the river to a road which goes  straight up a long hill to a main highway leading to Luneville, five  miles away. We passed over this bridge and were asked to note its  width--only enough to permit the passage of one car at a time. Two roads  converge at it and lead to the little town.    During one of the important conflicts an army of 150,000 Germans was  sent around by way of Luneville to cross the river at Gerbeviller and  fall upon the right flank of the French army. The French had been able  to spare but few troops for this point, but they had barricaded the  streets of the town and posted a company of chasseurs, seventy-five in  number, at the bridge with a mitralleuse. This was an excellent  position, as there was a small building there which screened the  chasseurs from view.    [Illustration: Ruins of Gerbeviller.]    At 8 o'clock in the morning the German advance body, twelve thousand  strong, appeared at the intersection of the road near the top of the  hill across the river. They advanced in solid formation, marching in  the goose step and singing, to the music of a band, their war hymn,  \"Deutchland Uber Alles.\" It was a beautiful morning and the sun  glistened on the German helmets as they came down the slope, an  apparently innumerable army. In this form they reached the end of the  bridge opposite to where the chasseurs were located. The captain of that  little band of French ordered them to halt, and they did so, the rear  ranks closing up on those in front before the order could be passed  along by their commander.    In a moment, however, the column began to move again and then the  captain of the chasseurs waved his hand and the mitralleuses opened on  the advancing host. The range was point blank and there was absolutely  no protection. The hail of bullets mowed down the Germans and they broke  ranks, fleeing back up the hill and out of range.    All was quiet for half an hour and then a detachment of cavalry,  evidently ordered to rush the bridge, came down at a gallop, having been  formed in the shelter of a road branching off the main highway a short  distance from the bridge. They were met by a hail of bullets and nearly  all went down before they reached the bridge, while the few who did so  fell on it or tumbled, with their horses, into the river.    The whole German force was delayed until a battery could be brought up  from the rear and trained on the small building sheltering the chasseurs  and their machine guns. For some reason, the gunners could not get the  range on this small building, and after firing a few shots in its  direction, turned their guns on the magnificent chateau, a short  distance down the river. At this point there was a small foot bridge,  and the German commander evidently meant to try to rush it. Before doing  so, however, he was going to make certain that the Chateau, which  commanded it, did not conceal another band of defenders. This seems to  be the only explanation for the bombardment of the Chateau, which was  one of the finest country homes in France and entirely unoccupied. At  any rate, they fired shell after shell at the building. I secured a  picture of this which shows the work of the guns.    But, as the French tell the story, no effort was then made to cross the  foot bridge below the town. A battery was swung down the hill to the end  of the bridge, apparently to shell the defenders from that point. The  machine guns barked again and every man with the battery fell. Scores  more were killed before it could be withdrawn and the way cleared. Owing  to the steep banks it seemed hard for the Germans to locate a battery in  an unexposed position, and they considered again. Finally they shelled  the Chateau some more and then sent a detachment to take that bridge,  expecting to get around in the rear of the chasseurs. A machine gun had  been sent to the footbridge in the meantime, and the Germans did not  get across it until the ammunition ran out and two hundred of them were  killed. When they did cross, the little band at the main bridge, of whom  one had been killed and six wounded, retreated to the main army, and  then the Germans crossed in force and started to burn the town.    The heroes of the bridge had held the German advance guard, numbering  12,000 men, from 8 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon, and in the  meantime the great battle they had expected to win had been fought and  lost.    Naturally the Germans were angry, and apparently they vented their  spleen upon the village. The great Chateau, its pride and chief  attraction, had been destroyed, but the conquerors at once begun to burn  the little town, evidently determining to reserve only enough to make a  place for headquarters for their general. They did burn it, but not so  completely as they had intended.    [Illustration: Sister Julie.]    Here is where Sister Julie comes in. Sister Julie is the most popular  woman in France as well as the most famous. We heard of her long before  we got to Gerbeviller and long after we left, but we were not fortunate  enough to meet her, as she was away at the time the Commission reached  the town. Although a member of a religious order, she has been decorated  with the grand cross of the Legion of Honor--the highest decoration  France confers upon her heroes. To pin this on her habit President  Poincaire journeyed all the way from Paris with his suite, and now  Sister Julie will not wear it. She says that religeuse do not wear  decorations--they are doing the work of the Lord.    In describing Sister Julie and her work the people of Gerbeviller are  even more enthusiastic than in recounting the manner in which  seventy-five Frenchmen stopped twelve thousand Germans. It seems that  when the German forces crossed the"]]]
