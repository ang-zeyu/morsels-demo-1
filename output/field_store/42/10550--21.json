There, sitting sociably on my sleeping-bag was a great black  tarantula, as large as my hand.    For one still moment, notwithstanding my contempt for Lawson's advice,  I certainly acted upon it to the letter. If ever I was quiet, and if  ever I was cold, the time was then. My companions snored in blissful  ignorance of my plight. Slight rustling sounds attracted my wary gaze  from the old black sentinel on my knee. I saw other black spiders  running to and fro on the silver, sandy floor. A giant, as large as a  soft-shell crab, seemed to be meditating an assault upon Jones's ear.  Another, grizzled and shiny with age or moonbeams I could not tell  which--pushed long, tentative feelers into Wallace's cap. I saw black  spots darting over the roof. It was not a dream; the cave was alive  with tarantulas!    Not improbably my strong impression that the spider on my knee  deliberately winked at me was the result of memory, enlivening  imagination. But it sufficed to bring to mind, in one rapid, consoling  flash, the irrevocable law of destiny--that the deeds of the wicked  return unto them again.    I slipped back into my sleeping-bag, with a keen consciousness of its  nature, and carefully pulled the flap in place, which almost  hermetically sealed me up.    \"Hey! Jones! Wallace! Frank! Jim!\" I yelled, from the depths of my safe  refuge.    Wondering cries gave me glad assurance that they had awakened from  their dreams.    \"The cave's alive with tarantulas!\" I cried, trying to hide my unholy  glee.    \"I'll be durned if it ain't!\" ejaculated Frank.    \"Shore it beats hell!\" added Jim, with a shake of his blanket.    \"Look out, Jones, there's one on your pillow!\" shouted Wallace.    Whack! A sharp blow proclaimed the opening of hostilities.    Memory stamped indelibly every word of that incident; but innate  delicacy prevents the repetition of all save the old warrior's  concluding remarks: \"! ! ! place I was ever in! Tarantulas by the  million--centipedes, scorpions, bats! Rattlesnakes, too, I'll swear.  Look out, Wallace! there, under your blanket!\"    From the shuffling sounds which wafted sweetly into my bed, I gathered  that my long friend from California must have gone through motions  creditable to a contortionist. An ensuing explosion from Jones  proclaimed to the listening world that Wallace had thrown a tarantula  upon him. Further fearful language suggested the thought that Colonel  Jones had passed on the inquisitive spider to Frank. The reception  accorded the unfortunate tarantula, no doubt scared out of its wits,  began with a wild yell from Frank and ended in pandemonium.    While the confusion kept up, with whacks and blows and threshing about,  with language such as never before had disgraced a group of old  campers, I choked with rapture, and reveled in the sweetness of revenge.    When quiet reigned once more in the black and white canyon, only one  sleeper lay on the moon-silvered sand of the cave.    At dawn, when I opened sleepy eyes, Frank, Slim, Stewart and Lawson had  departed, as pre-arranged, with the outfit, leaving the horses  belonging to us and rations for the day. Wallace and I wanted to climb  the divide at the break, and go home by way of Snake Gulch, and the  Colonel acquiesced with the remark that his sixty-three years had  taught him there was much to see in the world. Coming to undertake it,  we found the climb--except for a slide of weathered rock--no great  task, and we accomplished it in half an hour, with breath to spare and  no mishap to horses.    But descending into Snake Gulch, which was only a mile across the  sparsely cedared ridge, proved to be tedious labor. By virtue of  Satan's patience and skill, I forged ahead; which advantage, however,  meant more risk for me because of the stones set in motion above. They  rolled and bumped and cut into me, and I sustained many a bruise trying  to protect the sinewy slender legs of my horse. The descent ended  without serious mishap.    Snake Gulch had a character and sublimity which cast Nail Canyon into  the obscurity of forgetfulness. The great contrast lay in the diversity  of structure. The rock was bright red, with parapet of yellow, that  leaned, heaved, bulged outward. These emblazoned cliff walls, two  thousand feet high, were cracked from turret to base; they bowled out  at such an angle that we were afraid to ride under them. Mountains of  yellow rock hung balanced, ready to tumble down at the first angry  breath of the gods. We rode among carved stones, pillars, obelisks and  sculptured ruined walls of a fallen Babylon. Slides reaching all the  way across and far up the canyon wall obstructed our passage. On every  stone silent green lizards sunned themselves, gliding swiftly as we  came near to their marble homes.    We came into a region of wind-worn caves, of all sizes and shapes, high  and low on the cliffs; but strange to say, only on the north side of  the canyon they appeared with dark mouths open and uninviting. One,  vast and deep, though far off, menaced us as might the cave of a  tawny-maned king of beasts; yet it impelled, fascinated and drew us on.    \"It's a long, hard climb,\" said Wallace to the Colonel, as we  dismounted.    \"Boys, I'm with you,\" came the reply. And he was with us all the way,  as we clambered over the immense blocks and threaded a passage between  them and pulled weary legs up, one after the other. So steep lay the  jumble of cliff fragments that we lost sight of the cave long before we  got near it. Suddenly we rounded a stone, to halt and gasp at the thing  looming before us.    The dark portal of death or hell might have yawned there. A gloomy  hole, large enough to admit a church, had been hollowed in the cliff by  ages of nature's chiseling.    \"Vast sepulcher of Time's past, give up thy dead!\" cried Wallace,  solemnly.    \"Oh! dark Stygian cave forlorn!\" quoted I, as feelingly as my friend.    Jones hauled us down from the clouds.    \"Now, I wonder what kind of a prehistoric animal holed in here?\" said  he.    Forever the one absorbing interest! If he realized the sublimity of  this place, he did not show it.    The floor of the cave ascended from the very threshold. Stony ridges  circled from wall to wall. We climbed till we were two hundred feet  from the opening, yet we were not half-way to the dome.    Our horses, browsing in the sage far below, looked like ants. So steep  did the ascent become that we desisted; for if one of us had slipped on  the smooth incline, the result would have been terrible. Our voices  rang clear and hollow from the walls. We were so high that the sky was  blotted out by the overhanging square, cornice-like top of the door;  and the light was weird, dim, shadowy, opaque. It was a gray tomb.    \"Waa-hoo!\" yelled Jones with all the power of his wide, leather lungs.    Thousands of devilish voices rushed at us, seemingly on puffs of wind.  Mocking, deep echoes bellowed from the ebon shades at the back of the  cave, and the walls, taking them up, hurled them on again in fiendish  concatenation.    We did not again break the silence of that tomb, where the spirits of  ages lay in dusty shrouds; and we crawled down as if we had invaded a  sanctuary and invoked the wrath of the gods.    We all proposed names: Montezuma's Amphitheater being the only rival of  Jones's selection, Echo cave, which we finally chose.    Mounting our horses again, we made twenty miles of Snake Gulch by noon,  when we rested for lunch. All the way up we had played the boy's game  of spying for sights, with the honors about even. It was a question if  Snake Gulch ever before had such a raking over. Despite its name,  however, we discovered no snakes.    From the sandy niche of a cliff where we lunched Wallace espied a tomb,  and heralded his discovery with a victorious whoop. Digging in old  ruins roused in him much the same spirit that digging in old books  roused in me. Before we reached him, he had a big bowie-knife buried  deep in the red, sandy floor of the tomb.    This one-time sealed house of the dead had been constructed of small  stones, held together by a cement, the nature of which, Wallace  explained, had never become clear to civilization. It was red in color  and hard as flint, harder than the rocks it glued together. The tomb  was half-round in shape, and its floor was a projecting shelf of cliff  rock. Wallace unearthed bits of pottery, bone and finely braided rope,  all of which, to our great disappointment, crumbled to dust in our  fingers. In the case of the rope, Wallace assured us, this was a sign  of remarkable antiquity.    In the next mile we traversed, we found dozens of these old cells, all  demolished except a few feet of the walls, all despoiled of their  one-time possessions. Wallace thought these depredations were due to  Indians of our own time. Suddenly we came upon Jones, standing under a  cliff, with his neck craned to a desperate angle.    \"Now, what's that?\" demanded he, pointing upward.    High on the cliff wall appeared a small, round protuberance. It was of  the unmistakably red color of the other tombs; and Wallace, more  excited than he had been in the cougar chase, said it was a sepulcher,  and he believed it had never been opened.    From an elevated point of rock, as high up as I could well climb, I  decided both questions with my glass. The tomb resembled nothing so  much as a mud-wasp's nest, high on a barn wall. The fact that it had  never been broken open quite carried Wallace away with enthusiasm.    \"This is no mean discovery, let me tell you that,\" he declared. \"I am  familiar with the Aztec, Toltec and Pueblo ruins, and here I find no  similarity. Besides, we are out of their latitude. An ancient race of  people--very ancient indeed lived in this canyon. How long ago, it is  impossible to tell.\"    \"They must have been birds,\" said the practical Jones. \"Now, how'd that  tomb ever"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20571"],[0,"Woman's Work in Music (#17)"],[1,",  \"Carina,\" as well as through her songs.    Kate Fanny Loder, not content with songs and the opera \"L'Elisir  d'Amore,\" has composed an overture for orchestra, two string quartettes,  a piano trio, piano and violin sonatas, minor piano pieces, and some  organ works. Caroline Orger (1818-92) was another talented composer  whose work possessed sincerity and artistic value, and was above the  merely popular vein. Among her productions, which have been often  performed, are tarantellas, a sonata, and other piano pieces, a 'cello  sonata, a piano quartette and trio, and a piano concerto.    Alice Mary Smith (1839-84) seems to have been on the whole the foremost  woman composer that England has yet produced. A pupil of Sterndale  Bennett and Sir George A. Macfarren, she devoted herself wholly to  composition, and made it her life-work. Her music is clear and well  balanced in form, excellent in thematic material, and endowed with an  expressive charm of melodic and harmonic beauty. Among her orchestral  works are two symphonies, one in C minor and the other in G; four  overtures, \"Endymion,\" \"Lalla Rookh,\" \"The Masque of Pandora,\" and  \"Jason, or the Argonauts and Sirens;\" a concerto for clarinet and  orchestra, and an \"Introduction and Allegro\" for piano and orchestra.  Her chamber music is also successful. It consists of four quartettes for  piano and strings in B flat, D, E, and G minor, also three string  quartettes. With the orchestral works should go two intermezzi for \"The  Masque of Pandora,\" finished later than the overture. Her published  cantatas include \"Ruedesheim,\" \"Ode to the Northeast Wind,\" a strong  work, \"The Passions\" (Collins), \"Song of the Little Baltung\" (Kingsley),  and \"The Red King\" (Kingsley). Her many part-songs, duets, and solos are  imbued with rare melodic charm, as may be seen from the famous duet,  \"Oh, that we two were maying.\" Her career, though none too long in  years, was one of constant creative activity.    There are a number of English women who have done excellent work in the  large orchestral forms, if we may count festival performances as a  measure of success. Edith Greene has composed a symphony, which was well  received at London in 1895. To her credit may be placed many smaller  works of real merit, among them a worthy violin sonata. Amy Elsie  Horrocks, born in Brazil, brought out her orchestral legend, \"Undine,\"  in 1897. She has also composed incidental music to \"An Idyl of New  Year's Eve,\" a 'cello sonata, variations for piano and strings, several  dramatic cantatas, a number of songs, and many piano and violin pieces.  Besides doing this, she has won fame as a pianist. Mrs. Julian Marshall,  born at Rome, has produced several orchestral works, as well as several  cantatas, an operetta, a nocturne for clarinet and orchestra, and a  number of songs. Oliveria Louisa Prescott, a native of London and a  pupil of the Royal Academy of Music, is responsible for two symphonies,  several overtures, a piano concerto, and some shorter orchestral pieces,  besides vocal and choral work.    Dora Bright, born at Sheffield in 1863, another student of the Royal  Academy, is one of England's most gifted musicians at the present time.  She became assistant teacher of piano, harmony, and counterpoint, and  won many prizes, being the first woman to obtain the Lucas medal for  composition. Her two piano concertos are praised by critics for their  \"bright and original fancy and melodious inspiration of a high order,  coupled with excellent workmanship.\" The orchestral colouring is said to  be thoroughly exquisite. A fantasia for piano and orchestra was given at  the London Philharmonic Concerts in 1892, the first instance of a  woman's composition being given by that orchestra. Her string quartettes  have won notice, also her piano duos, a violin suite, some flute and  piano pieces, and several piano solos and songs.    Alice Borton has published an \"Andante and Rondo\" for piano and  orchestra, as well as several piano works (suite in old style) and a  number of songs. Edith A. Chamberlayne has composed two symphonies, as  well as a manuscript opera, a sextette for harp, flute, and strings, and  various harp, organ, and piano music. Edith Swepstone has had some  movements of an unfinished Symphony performed, also an overture, \"Les  Tenebres,\" at London in 1897. She has written a piano quintette and a  string quartette, besides short cantatas and the usual lesser pieces for  violin, piano, and voice. Marie Wurm, born at Southampton in 1860, is a  successful pianist as well as composer. Her concerto in B minor is  highly praised for excellent workmanship, originality, and melodic  strength and charm. Among her other works are a concert overture, a  string quartette, violin and 'cello sonatas, some five-voiced madrigals,  with various piano pieces and songs.    Rosalind Frances Ellicott has won a place of honour among women  composers. She was born in 1857, and is a daughter of the Bishop of  Gloucester. Her music is not especially ecclesiastic in vein, but  includes many notable secular compositions. Among her important works  are dramatic, concert, and festival overtures, and a fantasia for piano  and orchestra, all given at various English festivals. Of her various  cantatas, the \"Birth of Song,\" \"Elysium,\" and \"Henry of Navarre\" have  met with the most success. She has written two piano trios, a string  quartette, and much music for 'cello, piano, and voice.    Ethel M. Smyth, who recently was brought into notice in America by the  performance of her opera, \"Der Wald,\" is one of England's talented  musical women. In purely orchestral vein she has produced a serenade in  D and the overture \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" both being given at the  Crystal Palace in 1890. She has shown originality in other than  operatic fields, and her greatest work is a Mass in D. This is a  composition of decided merit, and is full of sustained dignity and  breadth of style. It is intensely modern in quality, and its expressive  feeling is somewhat reminiscent of Gounod, but it is not in any sense an  imitation of the great Frenchman. Her string quintette has been  performed at Leipsic. She has written a violin sonata and the usual  number of minor pieces and songs. Her opera has received much praise,  but the final verdict rates it as rather confused and undramatic, in  spite of much good music in the score.    Many women have attempted opera, but none have met with more than  temporary success. In England, owing to the example of Gilbert and  Sullivan, light operas and operettas have flourished to a considerable  degree. Mary Grant Carmichael met with some success through her  operetta, \"The Snow Queen,\" but like Miss Smyth gave the world a more  important work in the shape of a mass. Ethel Harraden, sister of the  novelist, had her opera, \"The Taboo,\" brought out at the Trafalgar  Square Theatre, London, with excellent results. She has composed an  operetta, \"His Last Chance,\" besides vocal, choral, and violin pieces.  Harriet Maitland Young has completed several operettas, of which \"An  Artist's Proof\" and the \"Queen of Hearts\" were successfully performed.  Annie Fortescue Harrison witnessed the production of her \"Ferry Girl\"  and \"Lost Husband\" at London. Louisa Gray's \"Between Two Stools\" has  been given at many places. Ida Walter's four-act opera, \"Florian,\"  received a London performance in 1886. Florence Marian Skinner has made  Italy the scene of her work. Her \"Suocera,\" in serious vein, appeared at  Naples in 1877, while her \"Mary, Queen of Scots,\" after being given at  St. Remo and Turin, received a London hearing.    England is preeminently a land of musical festivals, at which choral  work plays an important part. London and the larger cities have their  regular series of concerts, and the size of the capital attracts outside  artists, but many of the smaller towns have annual occasions, at which  local talent is sure to receive a full appreciation. This accounts for  the prevalence of cantatas in the English musical repertoire. Subjects  of all sorts are used, and dramatic, romantic, or even simple pastoral  themes appear to delight the British ear when set to music and given by  some singing society.    Among the many women who have attempted this form of composition, some  have already been mentioned, but a number have been satisfied with it  for their only efforts in extended style. Lizzie Harland produced her  dramatic cantata, \"C[oe]ur de Lion,\" in 1888, following it with the  \"Queen of the Roses\" for female voices. Ethel Mary Boyce, winner of  various prizes, has composed \"Young Lochinvar,\" \"The Sands of  Corriemie,\" and other cantatas, as well as a March in E for orchestra.  Miss Heale, another London aspirant, is credited with \"Epithalamion,\"  \"The Water Sprite,\" and other choral works. Emily M. Lawrence has  produced \"Bonny Kilmeny\" and \"The Ten Virgins,\" both for female voices,  while Caroline Holland has written the cantata, \"Miss Kilmansegg,\" and  the ballad, \"After the Skirmish,\" for chorus and orchestra. Miss Holland  has won laurels as a conductor, besides being known as a composer. All  of these have done a greater or less amount of work in the small forms,  for piano, voice, or violin.    Still longer is the list of women who have worked wholly in the shorter  forms. Yet the absence of ambitious work must not be taken to indicate a  lack of musical genius, for many of England's best known musical women  rest their fame upon a few short pieces. There is a vast difference  between good music and great music, and a song of real worth often  outlasts an ambitious but overswollen symphony that is laid on the shelf  after one hearing.    In the field of violin music, there are many women deserving mention.  Margaret Gyde, after taking prizes and scholarships, produced two  excellent violin sonatas, besides piano pieces, songs, and some organ  music. Contemporary organists, in"]]]
