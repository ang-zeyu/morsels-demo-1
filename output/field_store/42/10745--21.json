The Irish, fancying that the English were about to retreat, kept guard  carelessly. Part of the garrison was idling, part dosing. D'Usson was at  table. Saint Ruth was in his tent, writing a letter to his master filled  with charges against Tyrconnel. Meanwhile, fifteen hundred grenadiers;  each wearing in his hat a green bough, were mustered on the Leinster  bank of the Shannon. Many of them doubtless remembered that on that day  year they had, at the command of King William, put green boughs in their  hats on the banks of the Boyne. Guineas had been liberally scattered  among these picked men; but their alacrity was such as gold cannot  purchase. Six battalions were in readiness to support the attack.  Mackay commanded. He did not approve of the plan; but he executed it as  zealously and energetically as if he had himself been the author of it.  The Duke of Wirtemberg, Talmash, and several other gallant officers, to  whom no part in the enterprise had been assigned, insisted on serving  that day as private volunteers; and their appearance in the ranks  excited the fiercest enthusiasm among the soldiers.    It was six o'clock. A peal from the steeple of the church gave the  signal. Prince George of Hesse Darmstadt, and Gustavus Hamilton, the  brave chief of the Enniskilleners, descended first into the Shannon.  Then the grenadiers lifted the Duke of Wirtemberg on their shoulders,  and, with a great shout, plunged twenty abreast up to their cravats in  water. The stream ran deep and strong; but in a few minutes the head of  the column reached dry land. Talmash was the fifth man that set foot  on the Connaught shore. The Irish, taken unprepared, fired one confused  volley and fled, leaving their commander, Maxwell, a prisoner. The  conquerors clambered up the bank over the remains of walls shattered by  a cannonade of ten days. Mackay heard his men cursing and swearing as  they stumbled among the rubbish. \"My lads,\" cried the stout old Puritan  in the midst of the uproar, \"you are brave fellows; but do not swear.  We have more reason to thank God for the goodness which He has shown  us this day than to take His name in vain.\" The victory was complete.  Planks were placed on the broken arches of the bridge and pontoons  laid on the river, without any opposition on the part of the terrified  garrison. With the loss of twelve men killed and about thirty wounded  the English had, in a few minutes, forced their way into Connaught.  [100]    At the first alarm D'Usson hastened towards the river; but he was  met, swept away, trampled down, and almost killed by the torrent of  fugitives. He was carried to the camp in such a state that it was  necessary to bleed him. \"Taken!\" cried Saint Ruth, in dismay. \"It cannot  be. A town taken, and I close by with an army to relieve it!\" Cruelly  mortified, he struck his tents under cover of the night, and retreated  in the direction of Galway. At dawn the English saw far off, from the  top of King John's ruined castle, the Irish army moving through the  dreary region which separates the Shannon from the Suck. Before noon the  rearguard had disappeared. [101]    Even before the loss of Athlone the Celtic camp had been distracted by  factions. It may easily be supposed, therefore, that, after so great a  disaster, nothing was to be heard but crimination and recrimination. The  enemies of the Lord Lieutenant were more clamorous than ever. He and his  creatures had brought the kingdom to the verge of perdition. He would  meddle with what he did not understand. He would overrule the plans of  men who were real soldiers. He would entrust the most important of all  posts to his tool, his spy, the wretched Maxwell, not a born Irishman,  not a sincere Catholic, at best a blunderer, and too probably a traitor.  Maxwell, it was affirmed, had left his men unprovided with ammunition.  When they had applied to him for powder and ball, he had asked whether  they wanted to shoot larks. Just before the attack he had told them to  go to their supper and to take their rest, for that nothing more would  be done that day. When he had delivered himself up a prisoner, he had  uttered some words which seemed to indicate a previous understanding  with the conquerors. The Lord Lieutenant's few friends told a very  different story. According to them, Tyrconnel and Maxwell had suggested  precautions which would have made a surprise impossible. The French  General, impatient of all interference, had omitted to take those  precautions. Maxwell had been rudely told that, if he was afraid, he had  better resign his command. He had done his duty bravely. He had stood  while his men fled. He had consequently fallen into the hands of the  enemy; and he was now, in his absence, slandered by those to whom his  captivity was justly imputable. [102] On which side the truth lay it  is not easy, at this distance of time, to pronounce. The cry against  Tyrconnel was, at the moment, so loud, that he gave way and sullenly  retired to Limerick. D'Usson, who had not yet recovered from the hurts  inflicted by his own runaway troops, repaired to Galway. [103]    Saint Ruth, now left in undisputed possession of the supreme command,  was bent on trying the chances of a battle. Most of the Irish officers,  with Sarsfield at their head, were of a very different mind. It was,  they said, not to be dissembled that, in discipline, the army of Ginkell  was far superior to theirs. The wise course, therefore, evidently was  to carry on the war in such a manner that the difference between the  disciplined and the undisciplined soldier might be as small as possible.  It was well known that raw recruits often played their part well in a  foray, in a street fight or in the defence of a rampart; but that, on a  pitched field, they had little chance against veterans. \"Let most of our  foot be collected behind the walls of Limerick and Galway. Let the rest,  together with our horse, get in the rear of the enemy, and cut off his  supplies. If he advances into Connaught, let us overrun Leinster. If he  sits down before Galway, which may well be defended, let us make a push  for Dublin, which is altogether defenceless.\" [104] Saint Ruth might,  perhaps, have thought this advice good, if his judgment had not  been biassed by his passions. But he was smarting from the pain of a  humiliating defeat. In sight of his tent, the English had passed a rapid  river, and had stormed a strong town. He could not but feel that, though  others might have been to blame, he was not himself blameless. He had,  to say the least, taken things too easily. Lewis, accustomed to be  served during many years by commanders who were not in the habit of  leaving to chance any thing which could be made secure by wisdom, would  hardly think it a sufficient excuse that his general had not expected  the enemy to make so bold and sudden an attack. The Lord Lieutenant  would, of course, represent what had passed in the most unfavourable  manner; and whatever the Lord Lieutenant said James would echo. A  sharp reprimand, a letter of recall, might be expected. To return  to Versailles a culprit; to approach the great King in an agony of  distress; to see him shrug his shoulders, knit his brow and turn his  back; to be sent, far from courts and camps, to languish at some dull  country seat; this was too much to be borne; and yet this might well  be apprehended. There was one escape; to fight, and to conquer or to  perish.    In such a temper Saint Ruth pitched his camp about thirty miles from  Athlone on the road to Galway, near the ruined castle of Aghrim, and  determined to await the approach of the English army.    His whole deportment was changed. He had hitherto treated the Irish  soldiers with contemptuous severity. But now that he had resolved  to stake life and fame on the valour of the despised race, he became  another man. During the few days which remained to him he exerted  himself to win by indulgence and caresses the hearts of all who were  under his command. [105] He, at the same time, administered to his  troops moral stimulants of the most potent kind. He was a zealous Roman  Catholic; and it is probable that the severity with which he had treated  the Protestants of his own country ought to be partly ascribed to the  hatred which he felt for their doctrines. He now tried to give to the  war the character of a crusade. The clergy were the agents whom he  employed to sustain the courage of his soldiers. The whole camp was in  a ferment with religious excitement. In every regiment priests were  praying, preaching, shriving, holding up the host and the cup. While the  soldiers swore on the sacramental bread not to abandon their colours,  the General addressed to the officers an appeal which might have moved  the most languid and effeminate natures to heroic exertion. They were  fighting, he said, for their religion, their liberty and their honour.  Unhappy events, too widely celebrated, had brought a reproach on the  national character. Irish soldiership was every where mentioned with a  sneer. If they wished to retrieve the fame of their country, this was  the time and this the place. [106]    The spot on which he had determined to bring the fate of Ireland to  issue seems to have been chosen with great judgment. His army was drawn  up on the slope of a hill, which was almost surrounded by red bog. In  front, near the edge of the morass, were some fences out of which a  breastwork was without difficulty constructed.    On the eleventh of July, Ginkell, having repaired the fortifications  of Athlone and left a garrison there, fixed his headquarters at  Ballinasloe, about four miles from Aghrim, and rode forward to take a  view of the Irish position. On his return he gave orders that ammunition  should be served out, that every musket and bayonet should be got ready  for action, and that early on the morrow every man should be under arms "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#17)"],[1," of which he is not always master--something that       at times strangely wills and works for itself. He may lay       down rules and devise principles, and to rules and       principles it will perhaps for years lie in subjection; and       then, haply without any warning of revolt, there comes a       time when it will no longer consent 'to harrow the valleys,       or be bound with a band in the furrow'--when it 'laughs at       the multitude of the city, and regards not the crying of the       driver'--when, refusing absolutely to make ropes out of       sea-sand any longer, it sets to work on statue-hewing, and       you have a Pluto or a Jove, a Tisiphone or a Psyche, a       Mermaid or a Madonna, as fate or inspiration directs. Be the       work grim or glorious, dread or divine, you have little       choice left but quiescent adoption. As for you--the nominal       artist--your share in it has been to work passively under       dictates you neither delivered nor could question--that       would not be uttered at your prayer, nor suppressed nor       changed at your caprice.\"    It might have been added, that to those whose experience of men and  manners is neither extensive nor various, the construction of a  self-consistent monster is easier than the delineation of an imperfect  or inconsistent reality--with all its fallings-short, its fitful  aspirations, its mixed enterprises, and its interrupted dreams. But we  must refrain from further speculation and illustration:--enough having  been given to justify our characterizing this volume, with its preface,  as a more than usually interesting contribution to the history of female  authorship in England.    Pertinently of these biographies, the _Athenaeum_ remarks that \"some of  the most daring and original have owed their parentage, not to defying  _Britomarts_, at war with society, who choose to make their literature  match with their lives,--not to brilliant women figuring in the world,  in whom every gift and faculty has been enriched, and whetted sharp, and  encouraged into creative utterance, by perpetual communication with the  most distinguished men of the time,--but to writers living retired lives  in retired places, stimulated to activity by no outward influence,  driven to confession by no history that demands apologetic parable or  subtle plea.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [13] _Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey._ By Ellis and Acton Bell. A new  Edition Revised, with a Biographical Notice of the Authors, a Selection  from their Literary Remains, and a Preface. By Currer Bell. Smith, Elder  & Co.          DAVIS ON THE LAST HALF CENTURY.[14]    ETHERIZATION.      In 1802, the late reverend and venerable DR. MILLER of New Jersey, then  an active minister of the Presbyterian church in this city, published  here, in two large octavo volumes, the First Part of _A Brief Retrospect  of the Eighteenth Century, containing a Sketch of the Revolutions and  Improvements in Science, Arts and Literature, during that Period_. Six  other volumes were contemplated, to cover grounds since occupied by the  great work upon the Eighteenth Century, by Dr. Schlosser, but they never  appeared. The facts embraced in Dr. Miller's Retrospect illustrated an  extraordinary and successful intellectual activity in the preceding  hundred years; but the fruits of investigation and reflection in that  time were less remarkable and important than those which have marked the  first half of the Nineteenth Century, of which the Rev. EMERSON DAVIS,  D.D., has attempted to give us a survey in a single duodecimo. Within  such brief limits completeness and fulness were out of the question, but  we had a right to ask a judicious selection of topics, and--however  brief and imperfect,--a careful and an honest statement of facts. We are  sorry to perceive that brevity is the only redeeming quality of Dr.  Davis's performance. It is altogether worthless, in almost every  respect, and unless it tempt some competent person to the composition of  an Account of the Progress of Society from 1800 to 1851, its appearance  will be a public misfortune, as well as a private disgrace. Perfectly to  justify this condemnation we will copy a single section--the one  treating of the discovery of         \"LETHEON, OR SULPHURIC ETHER, &c.         \"In the autumn of 1846, it was announced in the public       journals that a dentist in Boston, W. T. G. Morton, had       discovered a method of extracting teeth without pain. Dr.       Morton, it seems, was satisfied that he could increase his       business to any extent he pleased, if he could only discover       a method by which he could extract and insert teeth without       any pain to the patient. Having some knowledge of the fact       that, by inhaling the vapor of ether, a state of       insensibility could be produced, he applied to Dr. Charles       T. Jackson to know if it could be done with safety. It       occurred to him that it might produce such a degree of       stupor that a tooth might be extracted without a       consciousness of what was doing [_meaning_ being done]. On       the 30th of September, 1846, he inhaled the vapor himself,       and found that he remained in an unconscious state eight       minutes. On the same day, he administered it with success to       a man who called to have a tooth extracted. The man, on       recovering his consciousness, did not know that any       instrument had been applied to his tooth. On the 16th and       17th of October, at the suggestion of Dr. Morton, ether was       administered to two patients at the hospital, who were to       have surgical operations performed. The experiment was       successful. As soon as the fact was known, it was generally       applauded by the newspapers as a wonderful discovery, and       the question came up, To whom belongs the honor, and who       shall reap the reward? Dr. Jackson, in a letter to M.       Beaumont, published in Galignani's Messenger, in Paris,       January, 1847, says, 'I request permission to communicate to       the Academy, through you, a discovery which I have made, and       which I regard as important to suffering humanity.' It       appears that the idea of using ether to render a person       insensible _to pain_, was original with Dr. Morton, and that       Dr. Jackson did no more than give Dr. Morton some       information respecting the nature of ether, and the best       mode of inhaling it. But as Dr. Jackson was better known as       a man of science, Dr. Morton consented to take the patent in       the name of both, and Dr. Jackson sold out his share to Dr.       Morton for ten per cent. of the income that might be derived       from the sale of rights to use the discovery.         \"In February, 1847, another letter appeared in Galignani's       Messenger, from Dr. H. Wells, of Hartford, Connecticut, in       which he claimed to be the discoverer of the fact that the       respiring of gas would produce insensibility to pain. Dr.       Wells had been about the country for a few years previous,       _lecturing upon gases_, and had often administered the       exhilarating, or nitrous oxide, gas. There is _no evidence_       that he ever administered ether. He might, in his       experiments, have found that persons under the influence of       the nitrous gas were insensible to pain, but he had no right       to claim that he discovered that the vapor of ether would       produce that effect. The French Academy, however, conferred       rewards of merit upon both Jackson and Wells, and, in 1848,       the American Congress awarded to Morton the honor of the       discovery.         \"In 1847, several sharp articles appeared in the Boston       papers, some favorable to Morton, and others to Jackson.       Wells committed suicide that year, and nothing more was said       respecting his claims. Some spicy pamphlets were written.       The result has been that, under the shelter of the smoke of       controversy, every one that chose has made use of the       discovery without paying Morton for the right, and that he       has been actually impoverished by the attention he gave to       the subject.\"    This statement is a tissue of falsehood and absurdity. To deny to Dr.  Wells the _entire_ credit of this discovery, argues simply gross  ignorance or insolence. Whenever any matter deserving of historical  commemoration is submitted to controversy, and the evidence is not full  and absolute, and the decision is not unanimous or nearly so, the  historian must _himself_ enter into the investigation, and in his own  person pronounce judgment. Therefore Dr. Davis has no excuse for so  scandalous a misrepresentation of these events, in any communications or  suggestions by unknown parties. It was easy to be rightly informed, and  under such circumstances, ignorance is scarcely less criminal than  designed falsehood. In this case, the decision has plainly been in favor  of Dr. Wells, wherever there was authority of action. By means which we  do not care to state, but which are well known to us, Drs. Jackson and  Morton did indeed procure of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, a  recognition of their joint claims to be regarded as the discoverers of  etherization. The Academy of Sciences is not a fit tribunal. The Paris  Medical Society (of which the celebrated Chevalier Ricord is President)  is; and this society, after an elaborate investigation of the whole  subject, during which it listened to a speech of several hours by Mr.  Warren, the agent of Drs. Jackson and Morton, decided with the utmost  unanimity that Dr. Wells made the discovery, and awarded him therefor  the sum of 25,000 francs.    The statement that Dr. Wells \"went about the country lecturing upon  gases,\" is characteristically false. He never delivered even one  lecture, upon any subject whatever, in his life. It is equally false  that \"the American Congress awarded to Morton the"]]]
