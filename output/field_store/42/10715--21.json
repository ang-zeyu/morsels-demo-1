Your father would have to buy his wool this way if he  did not own Crescent Ranch; and even so he may send men to buy wool at  outside ranches too, for all I know.\"    \"I am going to ask him,\" Donald said.    \"Do not ask him now. He might not want to talk his business over here.  Wait until you get back East.\"    \"I hate to think of going back home, Sandy,\" the boy declared, regret in  his tones.    \"All good things must come to an end, lad. You will go back, finish your  schooling, go to college as your father wishes, and then, a gentleman  grown, you will be choosing some work.\"    Sandy studied Donald keenly.    \"Yes, I suppose that is just what I shall do. I am thinking some of  studying law, Sandy.\"    The Scotchman's face fell, but Donald did not notice it.    \"I've always thought I should like to stand up in court and make a great  plea--a speech that would sweep people off their feet,\" went on Donald.  \"Or,\" he added reflectively, \"I may be a judge.\"    Sandy scratched his head.    \"There's a good bit step between studying law and being a judge,\" said  he.    \"Perhaps after all I may decide not to be a judge,\" ruminated Donald. \"I  have always wanted to manage a baseball team and I may think I would  rather do that.\"    \"Go on with you!\" Sandy cried. \"Next you'll be having yourself a  lighthouse-keeper.\" Then he added wistfully: \"But no matter what you  are, laddie, dinna forget Crescent Ranch.\"    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XII    HOME TO THE EAST      Within two weeks Thornton, Mr. Clark, and Donald were back in  Massachusetts, and the thread of Eastern life was once more taken up.    Donald did not return to school, since it was now so near June that to  enter the class seemed useless; instead it was decided that he should  have a tutor through the summer to help him make up the work he had  lost, and thereby enable him to go on with his class in the fall. This  tutor, however, had to be found, and until he was the boy was free from  duties of every sort. It gave him a strange sense of loneliness to be  with nothing to do. All his friends were in school--there was no one to  play with.    \"I think I'll go in to the office with you, father,\" he suggested one  morning. \"It is stupid staying round in Cambridge when all the fellows  are slaving for their exams. I have been so busy while out on the ranch  that now I do not know what to do with myself.\"    Mr. Clark agreed to the proposal cordially.    In consequence it came about that Donald joined Thornton at the large  Boston warehouse. The store was not new to the boy, for he had often  been there with his father; but to Thornton this part of the wool  business was as novel as the first glimpses of ranching had been to  Donald. The high building of yellow brick with floor after floor of  hurrying men, the offices noisy with the hum of typewriters, the ring of  telephones, the comings and goings of messenger-boys and  mail-carriers--all this little universe of rush and confusion was an  untried world to Thornton. Its strangeness dazed him.    Mr. Clark promptly placed him in the accounting department, but to his  surprise Thornton foundered there helplessly. It was one thing to keep  books amid the quiet and leisure of Crescent Ranch, and quite another to  struggle with columns of figures in the riot of modern business  surroundings. At the end of three days the Westerner looked gray and  tired, and had accomplished nothing.    \"I don't know what I am going to do with him, Don,\" announced Mr. Clark,  much troubled. \"I have brought him here from Idaho, and of course I am  bound to look out for him; yet there does not seem to be an earthly  thing he can do. My plan was to set him to keeping books in Cook's  place, and send Cook out to Crescent Ranch to help Sandy. Sandy, you  know, cannot handle accounts. Poor lad--he had little opportunity for  schooling in his youth, and the financial side of his work is his one  weak spot. He realizes this himself, and it was only on the condition  that I send him an assistant that he would undertake the management of  the ranch at all. I expected, as I say, that Cook would go; evidently,  however, Thornton is not going to be able to fill his place. What shall  I do with Thornton, Don? We must find a niche for him somehow.\"    Donald reflected a moment.    \"Had you thought, father, of trying him up-stairs?\" he asked.    \"No, I hadn't. We need a foreman up there, but I had not considered  Thornton for the position. That is a happy inspiration, son. We will  give him a try. He may make good yet.\"    Accordingly Thornton was sent to the upper floors of the warehouse,  where the wool was stored. Here were great piles of loose wool reaching  from floor to ceiling. Some piles contained only the finest wool; other  piles that which was next-best in quality; still other piles were made  up of the coarser varieties. There were piles of scoured wool, piles of  South American and Australian wool--wool, wool, wool everywhere!    With keen interest Thornton looked about him. He wandered from one vast  pyramid of fleeces to another, catching up handfuls of the different  varieties and examining them. Then he walked to where the men were busy  opening the first spring shipments of wool from Crescent Ranch. The  wool was emptied from the sacks onto the floor in great heaps, and crews  of men--skilled in judging the fiber--set to work to sort it, separating  the different qualities into piles. Donald, who was looking on, saw a  smile pass over Thornton's face--the first smile that had brightened it  in days. Then, almost instinctively, the ranchman rolled up his sleeves  and began to grade wool with the other men. He worked rapidly, for he  was thoroughly familiar with what he was doing.    The next day when Donald went up-stairs he found Thornton directing a  lot of green hands who were packing the sorted, or graded wool, in bags.  Later in the week it chanced that the man who weighed the wool fell ill  and the Westerner took his place at the scales, seeing that the sacks of  wool were correctly weighed and recorded, that they were sewed up  strongly, and marked for shipping.    Gradually the men, recognizing Thornton's ability, began to defer to his  judgment. The month was not out before Clark & Sons began to wonder  what they had done before Thornton came. So familiar did he make himself  with the stock that even Mr. Clark sent for and consulted him about  orders and shipments.    \"He is proving himself a thoroughly useful man, Don,\" declared Mr. Clark  rubbing his hands with satisfaction. \"His knowledge of the ranch and of  the wool itself is invaluable. It is just a case of putting the peg into  the proper hole. Thornton was like a fish out of water here in the  office. Now he is in his element. I shall make him foreman of the  shipping department--a position just suited to him, and which he will  fill well.\"    \"I am so glad he has made good, father,\" said Donald. \"Now, what are you  going to do about an assistant for Sandy? That is the next question to  settle, I suppose. Have you found any one?\"    \"Not yet. I have had a great deal to do, Don. I shall, however, look up  some one as soon as possible. In the meantime, before you start in with  your tutor, and Thornton gets so rushed that he cannot be spared, I want  to take you both to Mortonstown to visit the Monitor Mills. Thornton  has never seen the manufacture of woolen goods and will be the more  intelligent for doing so; as for you, I am anxious to have you complete  the story of wool-growing which you began at Crescent Ranch. To stop  short of visiting a mill now would be like reading the opening chapters  of a book and never finishing the volume.\"    \"I do want to know the rest of the story very much, father,\" Donald  replied. \"I told Sandy when I was out West that I hoped you would some  time take me to a mill. Since we got home, though, you have been so busy  that I did not like to ask you.\"    \"That was thoughtful of you, son. Ordinarily I should have preferred to  wait; it chances, however, that something has come up which obliges me  to see the Monitor people right away. So I shall go out there to-morrow,  taking Thornton with me, and if you like you may go also.\"    \"Of course I'd like!\" exclaimed Donald eagerly.    The next day proved to be so gloriously clear that instead of making  the trip to Mortonstown by train Mr. Clark decided to run out in his  touring-car. It was not a long ride--something over twenty-five  miles--but to Thornton, unaccustomed to the luxury of a modern  automobile, the journey was one of unalloyed delight.    \"It is like riding in a sitting-room on wheels, isn't it?\" he murmured  with a sigh of satisfaction.    \"Some day you will be having a car of your own, Thornton,\" Mr. Clark  said, smiling.    \"And riding to Idaho in it,\" put in Donald.    \"Well, it is about the smoothest way I ever traveled!\" declared the  ranchman. \"When we came East I thought that sleeping-car close to a  moving palace; but this thing has the train beaten to a frazzle. You see  I am used to jolting over rough roads in springless wagons, and it is  something new to me to go along as if I was sliding down-hill on a  velvet sofa-cushion.\"    Donald and his father heartily enjoyed the big fellow's pleasure.    As for Thornton, when the car came to a stop before the puffing  Mortonstown mills it was with regret that he dragged himself from the  seat. Still, he had the ride home in anticipation--that was a comforting  thought.    Once within the mills, however, even the memory of the homeward journey  faded from his mind. The vast buildings throbbing with the beat of  engines, the click and whirr of bobbins, and the clash of machinery,  blotted out everything else.    When they entered Mr. Munger, the manager, who was expecting them, came  forward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24869"],[0,"The Rámáyan of Válmíki, translated into English verse (#17)"],[1,"to none.\"  Soon as the steadfast devotees  Had made reply in words like these,  The youths began, disdaining sleep,  Six days and nights their watch to keep.  The warrior pair who tamed the foe,  Unrivalled benders of the bow,  Kept watch and ward unwearied still  To guard the saint from scathe and ill.  'Twas now the sixth returning day,  The hour foretold had past away.  Then Rama cried: \"O Lakshman, now  Firm, watchful, resolute be thou.  The fiends as yet have kept afar  From the pure grove in which we are:  Yet waits us, ere the day shall close,  Dire battle with the demon foes.\"      While thus spoke Rama borne away  By longing for the deadly fray,  See! bursting from the altar came  The sudden glory of the flame.  Round priest and deacon, and upon  Grass, ladles, flowers, the splendour shone,    And the high rite, in order due,  With sacred texts began anew.  But then a loud and fearful roar    Re-echoed through the sky;  And like vast clouds that shadow o'er    The heavens in dark July,  Involved in gloom of magic might    Two fiends rushed on amain,  Maricha, Rover of the Night,    Suvahu, and their train.  As on they came in wild career    Thick blood in rain they shed;  And Rama saw those things of fear    Impending overhead.  Then soon as those accursed two    Who showered down blood be spied,  Thus to his brother brave and true    Spoke Rama lotus-eyed:  \"Now, Lakshman, thou these fiends shalt see,    Man-eaters, foul of mind,  Before my mortal weapon flee    Like clouds before the wind.\"  He spoke. An arrow, swift as thought,    Upon his bow he pressed,  And smote, to utmost fury wrought,    Maricha on the breast.  Deep in his flesh the weapon lay    Winged by the mystic spell,  And, hurled a hundred leagues away,    In ocean's flood he fell.  Then Rama, when he saw the foe    Convulsed and mad with pain  Neath the chill-pointed weapon's blow,    To Lakshman spoke again:  \"See, Lakshman, see! this mortal dart    That strikes a numbing chill,  Hath struck him senseless with the smart,    But left him breathing still.  But these who love the evil way,    And drink the blood they spill,  Rejoicing holy rites to stay,    Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.\"  He seized another shaft, the best,    Aglow with living flame;  It struck Suvahu on the chest,    And dead to earth he came.  Again a dart, the Wind-God's own,    Upon his string he laid,  And all the demons were o'erthrown,    The saints no more afraid.  When thus the fiends were slain in fight,  Disturbers of each holy rite,  Due honour by the saints was paid  To Rama for his wondrous aid:  So Indra is adored when he  Has won some glorious victory.  Success at last the rite had crowned,  And Visvamitra gazed around,  And seeing every side at rest,  The son of Raghu thus addressed:  \"My joy, O Prince, is now complete:    Thou hast obeyed my will:  Perfect before, this calm retreat    Is now more perfect still.\"          Canto XXXIII. The Sone.      Their task achieved, the princes spent  That night with joy and full content.  Ere yet the dawn was well displayed  Their morning rites they duly paid,  And sought, while yet the light was faint,  The hermits and the mighty saint.  They greeted first that holy sire  Resplendent like the burning fire,  And then with noble words began  Their sweet speech to the sainted man:  \"Here stand, O Lord, thy servants true:  Command what thou wouldst have us do.\"      The saints, by Visvamitra led,  To Rama thus in answer said:  \"Janak the king who rules the land  Of fertile Mithila has planned  A noble sacrifice, and we  Will thither go the rite to see.  Thou, Prince of men, with us shalt go,  And there behold the wondrous bow,  Terrific, vast, of matchless might,  Which, splendid at the famous rite,  The Gods assembled gave the king.  No giant, fiend, or God can string  That gem of bows, no heavenly bard:  Then, sure, for man the task were hard.  When lords of earth have longed to know  The virtue of that wondrous bow,  The strongest sons of kings in vain  Have tried the mighty cord to strain.  This famous bow thou there shalt view,  And wondrous rites shalt witness too.  The high-souled king who lords it o'er  The realm of Mithila of yore  Gained from the Gods this bow, the price  Of his imperial sacrifice.  Won by the rite the glorious prize  Still in the royal palace lies,  Laid up in oil of precious scent  With aloe-wood and incense blent.\"      Then Rama answering, Be it so,  Made ready with the rest to go.  The saint himself was now prepared,  But ere beyond the grove he fared,  He turned him and in words like these  Addressed the sylvan deities:  \"Farewell! each holy rite complete,  I leave the hermits' perfect seat:  To Ganga's northern shore I go  Beneath Himalaya's peaks of snow.\"  With reverent steps he paced around  The limits of the holy ground,  And then the mighty saint set forth  And took his journey to the north.  His pupils, deep in Scripture's page,  Followed behind the holy sage,  And servants from the sacred grove  A hundred wains for convoy drove.  The very birds that winged that air,  The very deer that harboured there,  Forsook the glade and leafy brake  And followed for the hermit's sake.  They travelled far, till in the west  The sun was speeding to his rest,  And made, their portioned journey o'er,  Their halt on Sona's(171) distant shore.  The hermits bathed when sank the sun,  And every rite was duly done,  Oblations paid to Fire, and then  Sate round their chief the holy men.  Rama and Lakshman lowly bowed  In reverence to the hermit crowd,  And Rama, having sate him down  Before the saint of pure renown,  With humble palms together laid  His eager supplication made:  \"What country, O my lord, is this,  Fair-smiling in her wealth and bliss?  Deign fully, O thou mighty Seer,  To tell me, for I long to hear.\"  Moved by the prayer of Rama, he  Told forth the country's history.          Canto XXXIV. Brahmadatta.      \"A king of Brahma's seed who bore  The name of Kusa reigned of yore.  Just, faithful to his vows, and true,  He held the good in honour due.  His bride, a queen of noble name,  Of old Vidarbha's(172) monarchs came.  Like their own father, children four,  All valiant boys, the lady bore.  In glorious deeds each nerve they strained,  And well their Warrior part sustained.  To them most just, and true, and brave,  Their father thus his counsel gave:  \"Beloved children, ne'er forget  Protection is a prince's debt:  The noble work at once begin,  High virtue and her fruits to win.\"  The youths, to all the people dear,  Received his speech with willing ear;  And each went forth his several way,  Foundations of a town to lay.  Kusamba, prince of high renown,  Was builder of Kausambi's town,  And Kusanabha, just and wise,  Bade high Mahodaya's towers arise.  Amurtarajas chose to dwell  In Dharmaranya's citadel,  And Vasu bade his city fair  The name of Girivraja bear.(173)  This fertile spot whereon we stand  Was once the high-souled Vasu's land.  Behold! as round we turn our eyes,  Five lofty mountain peaks arise.  See! bursting from her parent hill,  Sumagadhi, a lovely rill,  Bright gleaming as she flows between  The mountains, like a wreath is seen,  And then through Magadh's plains and groves  With many a fair maeander roves.  And this was Vasu's old domain,  The fertile Magadh's broad champaign,  Which smiling fields of tilth adorn  And diadem with golden corn.      The queen Ghritachi, nymph most fair,  Married to Kusanabha, bare  A hundred daughters, lovely-faced,  With every charm and beauty graced.  It chanced the maidens, bright and gay  As lightning-flashes on a day  Of rain time, to the garden went  With song and play and merriment,  And there in gay attire they strayed,  And danced, and laughed, and sang, and played.  The God of Wind who roves at will  All places, as he lists, to fill,  Saw the young maidens dancing there,  Of faultless shape and mien most fair.  \"I love you all, sweet girls,\" he cried,  \"And each shall be my darling bride.  Forsake, forsake your mortal lot,  And gain a life that withers not.  A fickle thing is youth's brief span,  And more than all in mortal man.  Receive unending youth, and be  Immortal, O my loves, with me.\"      The hundred girls, to wonder stirred,  The wooing of the Wind-God heard,  Laughed, as a jest, his suit aside,  And with one voice they thus replied:  \"O mighty Wind, free spirit who  All life pervadest, through and through,  Thy wondrous power we maidens know;  Then wherefore wilt thou mock us so?  Our sire is Kusanabha, King;  And we, forsooth, have charms to bring  A God to woo us from the skies;  But honour first we maidens prize.  Far may the hour, we pray, be hence,  When we, O thou of little sense,  Our truthful father's choice refuse,  And for ourselves our husbands choose.  Our honoured sire our lord we deem,  He is to us a God supreme,  And they to whom his high decree  May give us shall our husbands be.\"      He heard the answer they returned,  And mighty rage within him burned.  On each fair maid a blast he sent:  Each stately form he bowed and bent.  Bent double by the Wind-God's ire  They sought the palace of their sire,  There fell upon the ground with sighs,  While tears and shame were in their eyes.  The king himself, with troubled brow,  Saw his dear girls so fair but now,  A mournful sight all bent and bowed,  And grieving thus he cried aloud:  \"What fate is this, and what the cause?  What wretch has scorned all heavenly laws?  Who thus your forms could curve and break?  You struggle, but no answer make.\"      They heard the speech of that wise king  Of their misfortune questioning.  Again the hundred maidens sighed,  Touched with their heads his feet, and cried:  \"The God of Wind, pervading space,  Would bring on us a foul disgrace,  And choosing folly's evil way  From virtue's path in scorn would stray.  But we in words like these reproved  The God of Wind whom passion moved:  \"Farewell, O Lord! "]]]
