[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#17)"],[1," horse and he was coming like the wind. Slone felt something grip his  heart. All the time and endurance and pain and thirst and suspense and  longing and hopelessness--the agony of the whole endless chase--closed  tight on his heart in that instant.    The running horse halted just in the belt of light cast by the burning  grass. There he stood sharply defined, clear as a cameo, not a hundred  paces from Slone. It was Wildfire.    Slone uttered an involuntary cry. Thrill on thrill shot through him.  Delight and hope and fear and despair claimed him in swift, successive  flashes. And then again the ruling passion of a rider held him--the  sheer glory of a grand and unattainable horse. For Slone gave up  Wildfire in that splendid moment. How had he ever dared to believe he  could capture that wild stallion? Slone looked and looked, filling his  mind, regretting nothing, sure that the moment was reward for all he  had endured.    The weird lights magnified Wildfire and showed him clearly. He seemed  gigantic. He shone black against the fire. His head was high, his mane  flying. Behind him the fire flared and the valley-wide column of smoke  rolled majestically upward, and the great monuments seemed to retreat  darkly and mysteriously as the flames advanced beyond them. It was a  beautiful, unearthly spectacle, with its silence the strangest feature.    But suddenly Wildfire broke that silence with a whistle which to  Slone's overstrained faculties seemed a blast as piercing as the  splitting sound of lightning. And with the whistle Wildfire plunged up  toward the pass. Slone yelled at the top of his lungs and fired his gun  before he could terrorize the stallion and drive him back down the  slope. Soon Wildfire became again a running black object, and then he  disappeared.    The great line of fire had gotten beyond the monuments and now  stretched unbroken across the valley from wall to slope. Wildfire could  never pierce that line of flames. And now Slone saw, in the paling sky  to the east, that dawn was at hand.        CHAPTER VII    Slone looked grimly glad when simultaneously with the first red flash  of sunrise a breeze fanned his cheek. All that was needed now was a  west wind. And here came the assurance of it.    The valley appeared hazy and smoky, with slow, rolling clouds low down  where the line of fire moved. The coming of daylight paled the blaze of  the grass, though here and there Slone caught flickering glimpses of  dull red flame. The wild stallion kept to the center of the valley,  restlessly facing this way and that, but never toward the smoke. Slone  made sure that Wildfire gradually gave ground as the line of smoke  slowly worked toward him.    Every moment the breeze freshened, grew steadier and stronger, until  Slone saw that it began to clear the valley of the low-hanging smoke.  There came a time when once more the blazing line extended across from  slope to slope.    Wildfire was cornered, trapped. Many times Slone nervously uncoiled and  recoiled his lasso. Presently the great chance of his life would  come--the hardest and most important throw he would ever have with a  rope. He did not miss often, but then he missed sometimes, and here he  must be swift and sure. It annoyed him that his hands perspired and  trembled and that something weighty seemed to obstruct his breathing.  He muttered that he was pretty much worn out, not in the best of  condition for a hard fight with a wild horse. Still he would capture  Wildfire; his mind was unalterably set there. He anticipated that the  stallion would make a final and desperate rush past him; and he had his  plan of action all outlined. What worried him was the possibility of  Wildfire doing some unforeseen feat at the very last. Slone was  prepared for hours of strained watching, and then a desperate effort,  and then a shock that might kill Wildfire and cripple Nagger, or a long  race and fight.    But he soon discovered that he was wrong about the long watch and wait.  The wind had grown strong and was driving the fire swiftly. The flames,  fanned by the breeze, leaped to a formidable barrier. In less than an  hour, though the time seemed only a few moments to the excited Slone,  Wildfire had been driven down toward the narrowing neck of the valley,  and he had begun to run, to and fro, back and forth. Any moment, then,  Slone expected him to grow terrorized and to come tearing up toward the  pass.    Wildfire showed evidence of terror, but he did not attempt to make the  pass. Instead he went at the right-hand slope of the valley and began  to climb. The slope was steep and soft, yet the stallion climbed up and  up. The dust flew in clouds; the gravel rolled down, and the sand  followed in long streams. Wildfire showed his keenness by zigzagging up  the slope.    \"Go ahead, you red devil!\" yelled Slone. He was much elated. In that  soft bank Wildfire would tire out while not hurting himself.    Slone watched the stallion in admiration and pity and exultation.  Wildfire did not make much headway, for he slipped back almost as much  as he gained. He attempted one place after another where he failed.  There was a bank of clay, some few feet high, and he could not round it  at either end or surmount it in the middle. Finally he literally pawed  and cut a path, much as if he were digging in the sand for water. When  he got over that he was not much better off. The slope above was  endless and grew steeper, more difficult toward the top. Slone knew  absolutely that no horse could climb over it. He grew apprehensive,  however, for Wildfire might stick up there on the slope until the line  of fire passed. The horse apparently shunned any near proximity to the  fire, and performed prodigious efforts to escape.    \"He'll be ridin' an avalanche pretty soon,\" muttered Slone.    Long sheets of sand and gravel slid down to spill thinly over the low  bank. Wildfire, now sinking to his knees, worked steadily upward till  he had reached a point halfway up the slope, at the head of a long,  yellow bank of treacherous-looking sand. Here he was halted by a low  bulge, which he might have surmounted had his feet been free. But he  stood deep in the sand. For the first time he looked down at the  sweeping fire, and then at Slone.    Suddenly the bank of sand began to slide with him. He snorted in  fright. The avalanche started slowly and was evidently no mere surface  slide. It was deep. It stopped--then started again--and again stopped.  Wildfire appeared to be sinking deeper and deeper. His struggles only  embedded him more firmly. Then the bank of sand, with an ominous, low  roar, began to move once more. This time it slipped swiftly. The dust  rose in a cloud, almost obscuring the horse. Long streams of gravel  rattled down, and waterfalls of sand waved over the steps of the slope.    Just as suddenly the avalanche stopped again. Slone saw, from the great  oval hole it had left above, that it was indeed deep. That was the  reason it did not slide readily. When the dust cleared away Slone saw  the stallion, sunk to his flanks in the sand, utterly helpless.    With a wild whoop Slone leaped off Nagger, and, a lasso in each hand,  he ran down the long bank. The fire was perhaps a quarter of a mile  distant, and, since the grass was thinning out, it was not coming so  fast as it had been. The position of the stallion was half-way between  the fire and Slone, and a hundred yards up the slope.    Like a madman Slone climbed up through the dragging, loose sand. He was  beside himself with a fury of excitement. He fancied his eyes were  failing him, that it was not possible the great horse really was up  there, helpless in the sand. Yet every huge stride Slone took brought  him closer to a fact he could not deny. In his eagerness he slipped,  and fell, and crawled, and leaped, until he reached the slide which  held Wildfire prisoner.    The stallion might have been fast in quicksand, up to his body, for all  the movement he could make. He could move only his head. He held that  up, his eyes wild, showing the whites, his foaming mouth wide open, his  teeth gleaming. A sound like a scream rent the air. Terrible fear and  hate were expressed in that piercing neigh. And shaggy, wet, dusty red,  with all of brute savageness in the look and action of his head, he  appeared hideous.    As Slone leaped within roping distance the avalanche slipped a foot or  two, halted, slipped once more, and slowly started again with that low  roar. He did not care whether it slipped or stopped. Like a wolf he  leaped closer, whirling his rope. The loop hissed round his head and  whistled as he flung it. And when fiercely he jerked back on the rope,  the noose closed tight round Wildfire's neck.    \"By G--d--I--got--a rope--on him!\" cried Slone, in hoarse pants.    He stared, unbelieving. It was unreal, that sight--unreal like the  slow, grinding movement of the avalanche under him. Wildfire's head  seemed a demon head of hate. It reached out, mouth agape, to bite, to  rend. That horrible scream could not be the scream of a horse.    Slone was a wild-horse hunter, a rider, and when that second of  incredulity flashed by, then came the moment of triumph. No moment  could ever equal that one, when he realized he stood there with a rope  around that grand stallion's neck. All the days and the miles and the  toil and the endurance and the hopelessness and the hunger were paid  for in that moment. His heart seemed too large for his breast.    \"I tracked--you!\" he cried, savagely. \"I stayed--with you! ... An' I  got a rope--on you! An'--I'll ride you--you red devil!\"    The passion of the man was intense. That endless, racking pursuit had  brought out all the hardness the desert had engendered in him. Almost  hate, instead of love, spoke in Slone's words. He hauled on the lasso,  pulling the stallion's head down and down. The action was the lust of  capture as well as the rider's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#17)"],[1,". When he was born the words, \"Say:  'truth is come and falsehood is vanished: Verily falsehood is a thing that  vanisheth,'\" (Sura xvii. 83) were found written on his right arm. When he  came into the world, he pointed with his fingers to heaven, sneezed, and  said: 'Praise be to God, the Lord of the world.' A person one day visited  Imam Hasan 'Askari (the eleventh Imam) and said: 'O son of the Prophet who  will be Khalif and Imam after thee?' He brought out a child and said: 'if  thou hadst not found favour in the eyes of God, He would not have shown  thee this child; his name is that of the Prophet, and so is his  patronymic,' (Abu 'l-Qasim). The sect who believe Mahdi to be alive at  present, say that he rules over cities in the far west, and he is even said  to have children. God alone knows the truth.[74]    The other large division, the Isma'ilians, agree with the Imamites in all  particulars save one. They hold that after Sadiq, the sixth Imam, commenced  what is called the succession of the \"concealed Imams.\" They believe that  there never can be a time when there shall be no Imam, but that he is now  in seclusion. This idea has given rise to all sorts of secret societies,  and has paved the way for a mystical religion, which often lands its  votaries in atheism.[75] {81}    The Ghair-i-Mahdi (literally \"without Mahdi\") are a small sect who believe  that Al-Mahdi will not reappear. They say that one Syed Muhammad of Jeypore  was the real Mahdi, the twelfth Imam, and that he has now gone never more  to return. They venerate him as highly as they do the Prophet, and consider  all other Musalmans to be unbelievers. On the night called Lailat-ul-Qadr,  in the month of Ramazan, they meet and repeat two rak'at prayers. After  that act of devotion is over, they say: \"God is Almighty, Muhammad is our  Prophet, the Quran and Mahdi are just and true. Imam Mahdi is come and  gone. Whosoever disbelieves this is an infidel.\" They are a very fanatical  sect.    There is another small community of Ghair-i-Mahdis called the Da,iri,  settled in the province of Mysore, who hold peculiar views on this point.  About four hundred years ago, a man named Syed Ahmad collected some  followers in the dominions of the Nizam of Hyderabad. He called himself the  Imam Mahdi, and said that he was superior to any prophet. He and his  disciples, being bitterly persecuted by the orthodox Musalmans, fled to a  village in the adjoining district of Mysore where their descendants,  fifteen hundred in number, now reside. It is said that they do not  intermarry with other Musalmans. The usual Friday service in the mosque is  ended by the leader saying: \"Imam Mahdi came and went away,\" to which the  people respond: \"He who does not believe this is a Kafir\" (infidel).    There are several Traditions which refer to the latter days. \"When of time  one day shall be left, God shall raise up a man from among my descendants,  who shall fill the world with justice, just as before him the world was  full of oppression.\" And again: \"The world shall not come to an end till  the king of the earth shall appear, who is a man of my family, and whose  name is the same as mine.\" When Islam entered upon the tenth century of its  existence, there was throughout Persia and India a millenarian movement.  Men {82} declared that the end was drawing near, and various persons arose  who claimed to be Al-Mahdi. I have already mentioned two. Amongst others  was Shaikh 'Alai of Agra. (956 A.H.) Shaikh Mubarak, the father of  Abu'l-Fazl--the Emperor Akbar's famous vizier, was a disciple of Shaikh  'Alai and from him imbibed Mahdavi ideas. This brought upon him the wrath  of the 'Ulama who, however, were finally overcome by the free-thinking and  heretical Emperor and his vizier. There never was a better ruler in India  than Akbar, and never a more heretical one as far as orthodox Islam is  concerned. The Emperor delighted in the controversies of the age. The Sufis  and Mahdavis were in favour at Court. The orthodox 'Ulama were treated with  contempt. Akbar fully believed that the millennium had come. He started a  new era, and a new religion called the 'Divine Faith.' There was toleration  for all except the bigoted orthodox Muslims. Abu'l-Fazl and others like  him, who professed to reflect Akbar's religious views, held that all  religions contained truth. Thus:--     \"O God, in every temple I see people that seek Thee, and in every language       I hear spoken, people praise Thee!        Polytheism and Islam feel after Thee,        Each religion says, 'Thou art one, without equal.'    If it be a mosque, people murmur the holy prayer, and if it be a        Christian Church, people ring the bell from love to Thee,        Sometimes I frequent the Christian cloister, and sometimes the            mosque,        But it is Thou whom I search from temple to temple.\"    In this reign one Mir Sharif was promoted to the rank of a Commander of a  thousand, and to an appointment in Bengal. His chief merit in Akbar's eyes  was that he taught the doctrine of the transmigration of souls and the  close advent of the millennium. He was a disciple of Mahmud of Busakhwan,  the founder of the Nuqtawiah sect. As this is another offshoot of the  Shia'hs I give a brief account of them here. Mahmud lived in the reign of  Timur and {83} professed to be Al-Mahdi. He also called himself the  Shakhs-i-Wahid--the Individual one. He used to quote the verse, \"It may be  that thy Lord will raise thee up to a glorious (mahmud) station.\" (Sura  xvii. 81). From this he argued that the body of man had been advancing in  purity since the creation, and that on its reaching to a certain degree,  one Mahmud (glorious) would arise, and that then the dispensation of  Muhammad would come to an end. He claimed to be the Mahmud. He also taught  the doctrine of transmigration, and that the beginning of everything was  the Nuqtah-i-khak--earth atom. It is on this account that they are called  the Nuqtawiah sect. They are also known by the names Mahmudiah and  Wahidiah. Shah 'Abbas king of Persia expelled them from his dominions, but  Akbar received the fugitives kindly and promoted some amongst them to high  offices of State.    This Mahdavi movement, arising as it did out of the Shia'h doctrine of the  Imamat, is a very striking fact. That imposters should arise and claim the  name and office of Al-Mahdi is not to be wondered at, but that large bodies  of men should follow them shows the unrest which dwelt in men's hearts, and  how they longed for a personal leader and guide.    The whole of the Shia'h doctrine on this point seems to show that there is  in the human heart a natural desire for some Mediator--some Word of the  Father, who shall reveal Him to His children. At first sight it would seem,  as if the doctrine of the Imamat might to some extent reconcile the  thoughtful Shia'h to the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation and  Mediation of Jesus Christ, to His office as the perfect revealer of God's  will; and as our Guide in life; but alas! it is not so. The mystic lore  connected with Shia'h doctrine has sapped the foundation of moral life and  vigour. A system of religious reservation, too, is a fundamental part of  the system in its mystical developments, whilst all Shia'hs may lawfully  practise \"takia,\" or religious {84} compromise in their daily lives. It  thus becomes impossible to place dependence on what a Shia'h may profess,  as pious frauds are legalised by his system of religion. If he becomes a  mystic, he looks upon the ceremonial and the moral law as restrictions  imposed by an Almighty Power. The omission of the one is a sin almost, if  not quite, as bad as a breach, of the other. The advent of Mahdi is the  good time when all such restrictions shall be removed, when the utmost  freedom shall be allowed. Thus the moral sense, in many cases, becomes  deadened to an extent such as those who are not in daily contact with these  people can hardly credit. The practice of \"takia,\" religious compromise,  and the legality of \"muta'h\" or temporary marriages, have done much to  demoralise the Shia'h community. The following words of a recent author  descriptive of the Shia'h system are in the main true, though they do not  apply to each individual in that system:--        \"There can be no stronger testimony of the corrupting power and the      hard and hopeless bondage of the orthodox creed, than that men should      escape from it into a system which established falsehood as the supreme      law of conduct, and regarded the reduction of men to the level of swine      as the goal of human existence.\"[76]    The Mutazilites, or Seceders, were once an influential body. They do not  exist as a separate sect now. An account of them will be given in the next  chapter.    In the doctrine of the Imamat, common to all the offshoots of the Shia'h  sect, is to be found the chief point of difference between the Sunni and  the Shia'h, a difference so great that there is no danger of even a  political union between these two great branches of Islam. I have already  described, too, how the Shia'hs reject the Sunnat, though they do not  reject Tradition. A good deal of ill-blood is still kept up by the  recollection--a recollection kept alive by the annual recurrence of the  Muharram fast--of the sad {85} fate of 'Ali and his sons. The Sunnis are  blamed for the work of their ancestors in the faith, whilst the Khalifs Abu  Bakr, Omar, and Osman are looked upon as usurpers. Not to them was  committed the wonderful ray of light. In the possession of that alone can  any one make good a claim to be the Imam, the Guide of the Believers. The  terrible disorders of the early days of Islam can only be understood when  we realise to some extent the passionate longing which men felt for a  spiritual head--an Imam. It was thought to be impossible that Muhammad, the  last--the seal--of the prophets should leave the Faithful "]]]
