[Illustration: MAKING MEXICAN DRAWN-WORK]          TEXTILES AND CLOTHING    PART III        DRESSMAKING    [Sidenote: Good Tools Necessary]    The greatest obstacle to home sewing of any kind is the failure to  provide suitable materials with which to do the work. To do good  work--to make attractive gowns--the simple tools which the work requires  must be provided. First, there should be needles and pins of the best  quality and make. They should be fine and well pointed. The needle  should be suitable to the material to be sewn and sufficiently large to  carry the thread easily. A blunt or bent needle should never be used.  Long or milliner's needles are preferred by many for basting.    [Sidenote: Thread]    A good supply of thread should be kept on hand--not too great a  quantity, but the stock should be added to as it is used. There should  be both silk and colored cotton, also twist for button holes, loops and  arrow heads and knitting silk to sew on and finish feather bone.    [Sidenote: Scissors]    Two pairs of scissors are required--one with long, sharp blades, and a  pair of medium sizes for snipping machine stitches.    Among the other necessary articles are a tape measure, cake of wax,  pencils or tailor's chalk, tracing wheel, emery, lap board.    Canvas, scrim, or any like material should be kept in the sewing room,  as these are invaluable for facings, linings of collars, cuffs, etc.  Hooks, eyes, buttons, tape, linings, featherbone and shields are  requisites not to be forgotten.    [Sidenote: Tapes]    Tape is constantly needed. Linen tape is thinner and makes a neater  finish for some purposes than cotton tape. The bias tape or binding now  kept by the larger stores is very useful for binding curved edges and  for other purposes.    [Sidenote: Cutting Table]    If a regular cutting table is not available, the dining room table  should be used. Skirts, bodices, ruffles, and bias bands should be cut  on firm, even, and large surfaces. If cut upon the floor or bed and  pressed on a coarse crash towel, the garment will have the undesirable  home-made look.    [Sidenote: Pressing Board]    A good pressing board should be provided and if possible a sleeve board.  In the process of garment making of any kind too much stress cannot be  laid upon constant and careful pressing.    The ironing board should have for its outside cover a _finely_ woven,  perfectly smooth cloth, tightly stretched, free from wrinkles, and  securely tacked.    Where there is gas, a small, portable stove should be kept near the  sewing table with a medium-sized flat iron. Lacking gas, one of the  single burner oil stoves may be used. An electric flat iron is  especially convenient.    [Sidenote: Bust Form]    A bust form is a great convenience in fitting and almost a necessity  for one who does much home dressing. These may be purchased at  department stores. Some kinds are adjustable, but it is always best to  make a carefully fitted lining for it and pad out to the correct shape  and size. The pattern should be one that extends well over the hips and  heavy unbleached muslin may be used. After padding firmly, the front  opening should be oversewed. Special care should be taken with shoulders  and neck and the neck band should be carefully adjusted on the figure.      [Illustration: PADDED BUST FORM    (From Dressmaking Up-to-Date, Butterick Co.)]      A padded sleeve lining is also very useful in making sleeves.    Dressmaking never should be begun until each needed article required for  the work has been purchased. The sewing room should be in order; the  machine well oiled and wiped before any work is undertaken.    [Sidenote: Skill and Taste]    If the finished garment is to be perfect, careful attention must be  given to _every_ detail of the cutting and making up. To possess  mechanical skill alone is not sufficient. A successful garment depends  not only upon the dexterity with which the worker manipulates the actual  tools of her craft, but upon all her faculties and her power of applying  them. She must have a comprehension of the laws of beauty in dress,  construction, ornament, color, selection, economy. The artisan knows the  technical part only, and looks upon each dress--each piece of lace and  velvet--as so much material to be snipped and cut and sewed, copying  from the fashion plate, making gown after gown alike. The artist, on the  other hand, makes the gown to suit the individual wearer, considering  each dress no matter how simple--and the simpler, the more artistic--as  a creation designed to suit the woman for whom it was planned.    People who study economy from principle will never adopt anything  extreme in weave, or color, or make. These extreme fashions are never  lasting; they are too conspicuous and are vulgarized by bad copies,  while a thing which is known to be good and beautiful once will remain  so for all time. Those who are beginners in the art of dressmaking  should select plain designs until skill is acquired. The making up and  finishing of new fabrics and new or untried methods are problems that  often dismay even the most experienced dressmaker.      PATTERNS    [Sidenote: Selection of Patterns]    The makers of good and reliable patterns are many. Always buy patterns  of firms that make proportion of figure as well as fashion a study.  These patterns state length of skirt, waist and hip measure and quantity  of material required in all widths. Buy a skirt pattern with correct hip  size, as it is much more difficult to change this than to alter the  dimensions of a waist. Adjust the pattern to the figure for which the  garment is to be cut and see that it is right in all of its proportions.  Always follow the notches indicated in the seams of the pattern, and  thus avoid putting wrong pieces together. Be sure that the pattern is  placed correctly upon the material with the _straight grain_ or warp  threads of the goods running directly on a line with the _straight  perforations_ indicated in the pattern. Lay the entire pattern upon the  cloth. This gives an idea just where every piece is to come out.    [Sidenote: What the Pattern Gives]    All patterns give one-half of the bodice and the skirt, from center of  back to center of front. The plain waist pattern consists of back,  curved side piece, under arm piece (sometimes these two pieces are in  one) front, upper and under sleeve, collar or neck band. Some patterns  allow for seams--others do not. Skirt patterns give only one-half of the  front gore. The _seam_ edges of front gore are marked by _one_ notch  near the waist line. The front or straight edge of the _first_ side gore  has one notch, and two on the back edge of side gore. All the gores may  be distinguished from the edges of the back gores by the lesser number  of notches. This is true of all skirt patterns. If the patterns are  studied carefully, all skirt cutting becomes very easy.    The object of goring a garment is to take out unnecessary fullness at  the top; reducing the weight, making the garment less clumsy, and giving  a nicety of finish which could not be done in heavy material if all the  goods were left to fit into a band. Skirts may be lined or unlined,  gored or full.      SEVEN-GORED SKIRT    The style may vary with the fashion, but a well-fitting skirt should  hang even around the bottom edge, should fit easily around the hips  without being strained or defining the figure too closely, or \"ride up\"  when sitting, should flare slightly from hips to the bottom of the  skirt, should not fall in between the feet, the back should fall well  behind the figure. For heavy goods, as little material as possible  consistent with the prevailing style should be used.    PLAN OF SKIRT MAKING         Shortening or lengthening of pattern if necessary.       Placing of goods.       Pinning on of pattern so there is no waste.       Cutting.       Removing and care of patterns.       Pinning, basting, or tacking of skirt to lining.       Joining of seams, fitting.       Stitching.       Pressing.       Finishing of seams and placket hole.       Making and putting on waist-band.       Marking length and finishing the bottom.       Fastenings, loops, braids, hooks and eyes.    [Sidenote: Lengthening or Shortening Patterns]    To lengthen or shorten a skirt pattern, measure the figure and regulate  the length of the patterns by making a fold in each gore two-thirds of  the way from the top of the pattern if too long. This is for the  simplest skirt pattern.

But, give me leave,  Sir, to ask in my turn, what reason you think I have to expect such an  invitation from the gentleman who gives tea?' 'I have my own reasons  (cried Mr Bramble, with some emotion) and am convinced, more than ever,  that this Paunceford is a contemptible fellow.' 'Sir (said the other,  laying down the paper) I have not the honour to know you; but your  discourse is a little mysterious, and seems to require some explanation.  The person you are pleased to treat so cavalierly, is a gentleman of  some consequence in the community; and, for aught you know, I may also  have my particular reasons for defending his character'--'If I was not  convinced of the contrary (observed the other) I should not have gone so  far'--'Let me tell you, Sir (said the stranger, raising his voice) you  have gone too far, in hazarding such reflections'.    Here he was interrupted by my uncle; who asked peevishly if he was  Don Quixote enough, at this time of day, to throw down his gauntlet as  champion for a man who had treated him with such ungrateful neglect.  'For my part (added he) I shall never quarrel with you again upon this  subject; and what I have said now, has been suggested as much by my  regard for you, as by my contempt of him'--Mr Serle, then pulling off  his spectacles, eyed uncle very earnestly, saying, in a mitigated  tone, 'Surely I am much obliged--Ah, Mr Bramble! I now recollect your  features, though I have not seen you these many years.' 'We might  have been less strangers to one another (answered the squire) if  our correspondence had not been interrupted, in consequence of a  misunderstanding, occasioned by this very--, but no matter--Mr Serle, I  esteem your character; and my friendship, such as it is, you may freely  command.' 'The offer is too agreeable to be declined (said he); I  embrace it very cordially; and, as the first fruits of it, request that  you will change this subject, which, with me, is a matter of peculiar  delicacy.'    My uncle owned he was in the right, and the discourse took a more  general turn. Mr Serle passed the evening with us at our lodgings; and  appeared to be intelligent, and even entertaining; but his disposition  was rather of a melancholy hue. My uncle says he is a man of uncommon  parts, and unquestioned probity: that his fortune, which was originally  small, has been greatly hurt by a romantic spirit of generosity, which  he has often displayed, even at the expence of his discretion, in favour  of worthless individuals--That he had rescued Paunceford from the lowest  distress, when he was bankrupt, both in means and reputation--That  he had espoused his interests with a degree of enthusiasm, broke with  several friends, and even drawn his sword against my uncle, who had  particular reasons for questioning the moral character of the said  Paunceford: that, without Serle's countenance and assistance, the other  never could have embraced the opportunity, which has raised him to this  pinnacle of wealth: that Paunceford, in the first transports of his  success, had written, from abroad, letters to different correspondents,  owning his obligations to Mr Serle, in the warmest terms of  acknowledgement, and declared he considered himself only as a factor  for the occasions of his best friend: that, without doubt, he had made  declarations of the same nature to his benefactor himself, though this  last was always silent and reserved on the subject; but for some years,  those tropes and figures of rhetoric had been disused; that, upon his  return to England, he had been lavish in his caresses to Mr Serle,  invited him to his house, and pressed him to make it his own: that he  had overwhelmed him with general professions, and affected to express  the warmest regard for him, in company of their common acquaintance; so  that every body believed his gratitude was liberal as his fortune; and  some went so far as to congratulate Mr Serle on both.    All this time Paunceford carefully and artfully avoided particular  discussions with his old patron, who had too much spirit to drop  the most distant hint of balancing the account of obligation: that,  nevertheless, a man of his feelings could not but resent this shocking  return for all his kindness: and, therefore, he withdrew himself from  the connexion, without coming to the least explanation or speaking  a syllable on the subject to any living soul; so that now their  correspondence is reduced to a slight salute with the hat, when they  chance to meet in any public place; an accident that rarely happens, for  their walks lie different ways. Mr Paunceford lives in a palace, feeds  upon dainties, is arrayed in sumptuous apparel, appears in all the pomp  of equipage, and passes his time among the nobles of the land. Serle  lodges in Stall-street, up two pair of stairs backwards, walks a-foot  in a Bath-rug, eats for twelve shillings a-week, and drinks water  as preservative against the gout and gravel--Mark the vicissitude.  Paunceford once resided in a garret; where he subsisted upon  sheep's-trotters and cow-heel, from which commons he was translated to  the table of Serle, that ever abounded with good-chear; until want of  economy and retention reduced him to a slender annuity in his decline of  years, that scarce affords the bare necessaries of life.--Paunceford,  however, does him the honour to speak of him still, with uncommon  regard; and to declare what pleasure it would give him to contribute in  any shape to his convenience: 'But you know (he never fails to add) he's  a shy kind of a man--And then such a perfect philosopher, that he looks  upon all superfluities with the most sovereign contempt. Having given  you this sketch of squire Paunceford, I need not make any comment on his  character, but leave it at the mercy of your own reflection; from which  I dare say, it will meet with as little quarter as it has found with    Yours always, J. MELFORD BATH, May 10.          To Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.    DEAR MOLLY,    We are all upon the ving--Hey for London, girl!--Fecks! we have been  long enough here; for we're all turned tipsy turvy--Mistress has  excarded Sir Ulic for kicking of Chowder; and I have sent O Frizzle  away, with a flea in his ear--I've shewn him how little I minded his  tinsy and his long tail--A fellor, who would think for to go, for to  offer, to take up with a dirty trollop under my nose--I ketched him in  the very feet, coming out of the housemaids garret.--But I have gi'en  the dirty slut a siserary. O Molly! the sarvants at Bath are devils  in garnet. They lite the candle at both ends--Here's nothing but  ginketting, and wasting, and thieving and tricking, and trigging; and  then they are never content--They won't suffer the 'squire and mistress  to stay any longer; because they have been already above three weeks in  the house; and they look for a couple of ginneys a-piece at our going  away; and this is a parquisite they expect every month in the season;  being as how no family has a right to stay longer than four weeks in  the same lodgings; and so the cuck swears she will pin the dish-clout to  mistress's tail; and the house-maid vows, she'll put cowitch in master's  bed, if so be he don't discamp without furder ado--I don't blame  them for making the most of their market, in the way of vails and  parquisites; and I defy the devil to say I am a tail-carrier, or ever  brought a poor sarvant into trouble--But then they oft to have some  conscience, in vronging those that be sarvants like themselves--For you  must no, Molly, I missed three-quarters of blond lace, and a remnant  of muslin, and my silver thimble; which was the gift of true love;  they were all in my workbasket, that I left upon the table in the  sarvants-hall, when mistresses bell rung; but if they had been under  lock and kay, 'twould have been all the same; for there are double keys  to all the locks in Bath; and they say as how the very teeth an't  safe in your head, if you sleep with your mouth open--And so says I to  myself, them things could not go without hands; and so I'll watch  their waters: and so I did with a vitness; for then it was I found Bett  consarned with O Frizzle. And as the cuck had thrown her slush at me,  because I had taken part with Chowder, when he fit, with the turnspit,  I resolved to make a clear kitchen, and throw some of her fat into the  fire. I ketched the chare-woman going out with her load in the morning,  before she thought I was up, and brought her to mistress with her whole  cargo--Marry, what do'st think she had got in the name of God? Her  buckets were foaming full of our best bear, and her lap was stuffed with  a cold tongue, part of a buttock of beef, half a turkey, and a swinging  lump of butter, and the matter of ten mould kandles, that had scarce  ever been lit. The cuck brazened it out, and said it was her rite to  rummage the pantry; and she was ready for to go before the mare: that  he had been her potticary many years, and would never think of hurting a  poor sarvant, for giving away the scraps of the kitchen. I went another  way to work with madam Betty, because she had been saucy, and called me  skandelus names; and said O Frizzle couldn't abide me, and twenty other  odorous falsehoods. I got a varrant from the mare, and her box being  sarched by the constable, my things came out sure enuff; besides a full  pound of vax candles, and a nite-cap of mistress, that I could sware to  on my cruperal oaf--O! then madam Mopstick came upon her merry  bones; and as the squire wouldn't hare of a pursecution, she scaped a  skewering: but the longest day she has to live, she'll remember your    Humble sarvant, W. JENKINS BATH, May 15.    If the hind should come again, before we be gone, pray send me the shift  and apron, with the vite gallow manky shoes; which you'll find in my  pillowber--Sarvice "]]]
