Lee (#17)"],[1,"recognise it and cease  from vain self-boasting and adulation, how strong would be my belief in  final success and happiness to our country! But what a cruel thing is  war; to separate and destroy families and friends, and mar the purest  joys and happiness God has granted us in this world; to fill our hearts  with hatred instead of love for our neighbours, and to devastate the  fair face of this beautiful world! I pray that, on this day when only  peace and good-will are preached to mankind, better thoughts may fill  the hearts of our enemies and turn them to peace. Our army was never  in such good health and condition since I have been attached to it.  I believe they share with me my disappointment that the enemy did not  renew the combat on the 13th. I was holding back all day and husbanding  our strength and ammunition for the great struggle, for which I thought  I was preparing. Had I divined that was to have been his only effort, he  would have had more of it. My heart bleeds at the death of every one of  our gallant men.\"    One marked characteristic of my father was his habit of attending to all  business matters promptly. He was never idle, and what he had to do he  performed with care and precision. Mr. Custis, my grandfather, had made  him executor of his will, wherein it was directed that all the slaves  belonging to the estate should be set free after the expiration of so  many years. The time had now arrived, and notwithstanding the exacting  duties of his position, the care of his suffering soldiers, and  his anxiety about their future, immediate and distant, he proceeded  according to the law of the land to carry out the provisions of the  will, and had delivered to every one of the servants, where it was  possible, their manumission papers. From his letters written at this  time I give a few extracts bearing on this subject:    \"...As regards the liberation of the people, I wish to progress in it as  far as I can. Those hired in Richmond can still find employment there  if they choose. Those in the country can do the same or remain on the  farms. I hope they will all do well and behave themselves. I should  like, if I could, to attend to their wants and see them placed to the  best advantage. But that is impossible. All that choose can leave the  State before the war closes....    \"...I executed the deed of manumission sent me by Mr. Caskie, and  returned it to him. I perceived that John Sawyer and James's names,  among the Arlington people, had been omitted, and inserted them. I fear  there are others among the White House lot which I did not discover. As  to the attacks of the Northern papers, I do not mind them, and do not  think it wise to make the publication you suggest. If all the names of  the people at Arlington and on the Pamunkey are not embraced in this  deed I have executed, I should like a supplementary deed to be drawn up,  containing all those omitted. They are entitled to their freedom and I  wish to give it to them. Those that have been carried away, I hope  are free and happy; I cannot get their papers to them, and they do not  require them. I will give them if they ever call for them. It will be  useless to ask their restitution to manumit them....\"            Chapter V -- The Army of Northern Virginia      The General's sympathy for his suffering  soldiers--Chancellorsville--Death of \"Stonewall\" Jackson--General  Fitzhugh Lee wounded and captured--Escape of his brother  Robert--Gettysburg--Religious revival--Infantry review--Unsatisfactory  commissariat      During this winter, which was a very severe one, the sufferings of  General Lee's soldiers on account of insufficient shelter and clothing,  the scant rations for man and beast, the increasing destitution  throughout the country, and his inability to better these conditions,  bore heavily upon him. But he was bright and cheerful to those around  him, never complaining of any one nor about anything and often indulging  in his quaint humour, especially with the younger officers, as when  he remarked to one of them, who complained of the tough biscuit at  breakfast:    \"You ought not to mind that; they will stick by you the longer!\"    His headquarters continued all the winter at the same place, and with  stove and fire-places in the tents, the General and his military family  managed to keep fairly comfortable. On February 6, 1863, he wrote to his  daughter, Agnes from this camp:    \"Camp Fredericksburg, February 6, 1863.    \"...I read yesterday, my precious daughter, your letter, and grieved  very much when last in Richmond at not seeing you. My movements are so  uncertain that I cannot be relied on for anything. The only place I am  to be found is in camp, and I am so cross now that I am not worth seeing  anywhere. Here you will have to take me with the three stools--the snow,  the rain, and the mud. The storm of the last twenty-four hours has added  to our stock of all, and we are now in a floating condition. But the sun  and the wind will carry all off in time, and then we shall appreciate  our relief. Our horses and mules suffer the most. They have to bear the  cold and rain, tug through the mud, and suffer all the time with hunger.  The roads are wretched, almost impassable. I heard of Mag lately. One  of our scouts brought me a card of Margaret Stuart's with a pair of  gauntlets directed to 'Cousin Robert.'... I have no news. General Hooker  is obliged to do something. I do not know what it will be. He is playing  the Chinese game, trying what frightening will do. He runs out his  guns, starts his wagons and troops up and down the river, and creates an  excitement generally. Our men look on in wonder, give a cheer, and all  again subsides in statu quo ante bellum. I wish you were here with me  to-day. You would have to sit by this little stove, look out at  the rain, and keep yourself dry. But here come, in all the wet, the  adjutants-general with the papers. I must stop and go to work. See how  kind God is; we have plenty to do in good weather and bad....\"    \"Your devoted father,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    On February 23d, he writes to Mrs. Lee:    \"Camp Fredericksburg, February 23, 1863.    \"The weather is now very hard upon our poor bushmen. This morning the  whole country is covered with a mantle of snow fully a foot deep. It was  nearly up to my knees as I stepped out this morning, and our poor horses  were enveloped. We have dug them out and opened our avenues a little,  but it will be terrible and the roads impassable. No cars from Richmond  yesterday. I fear our short rations for man and horse will have to be  curtailed. Our enemies have their troubles too. They are very strong  immediately in front, but have withdrawn their troops above and below  us back toward Acquia Creek. I owe Mr. F. J. Hooker [\"Fighting Joe\"  was Hooker's most popular sobriquet in the Federal army] no thanks for  keeping me here. He ought to have made up his mind long ago about  what do to--24th. The cars have arrived and brought me a young French  officer, full of vivacity, and ardent for service with me. I think the  appearance of things will cool him. If they do not, the night will, for  he brought no blankets.    \"R. E. Lee.\"    The dreary winter gradually passed away. Toward the last of April, the  two armies, which had been opposite each other for four months, began  to move, and, about the first of May, the greatest of Lee's battles was  fought. My command was on the extreme left, and, as Hooker crossed the  river, we followed a raiding party of the enemy's cavalry over toward  the James River above Richmond; so I did not see my father at any  time during the several day's fighting. The joy of our victory at  Chancellorsville was saddened by the death of \"Stonewall\" Jackson. His  loss was the heaviest blow the Army of Northern Virginia ever sustained.  To Jackson's note telling him he was wounded, my father replied:    \"I cannot express my regret at the occurance. Could I have directed  events, I should have chosen for the good of the country to have been  disabled in your stead. I congratulate you on the victory, which is due  to your skill and energy.\"    Jackson said, when this was read to him,    \"Better that ten Jacksons should fall than one Lee.\"    Afterward, when it was reported that Jackson was doing well, General Lee  playfully sent him word:    \"You are better off than I am, for while you have only lost your LEFT, I  have lost my RIGHT arm.\"    Then, hearing that he was worse, he said:    \"Tell him that I am praying for him as I believe I have never prayed for  myself.\"    After his death, General Lee writes to my mother, on May 11th:    \"...In addition to the deaths of officers and friends consequent upon  the late battles, you will see that we have to mourn the loss of the  great and good Jackson. Any victory would be dear at such a price. His  remains go to Richmond to-day. I know not how to replace him. God's will  be done! I trust He will raise up some one in his place....\"    Jones, in his Memoirs, says: \"To one of his officers, after Jackson's  death, he [General Lee] said: 'I had such implicit confidence in  Jackson's skill and energy that I never troubled myself to give him  detailed instructions. The most general suggestions were all that he  needed.'\"    To one of his aides, who came to his tent, April 29th, to inform him  that the enemy had crossed the Rappahannock River in heavy force,  General Lee made the playful reply:    \"Well, I heard firing, and I was beginning to think it was time some of  you lazy young fellows were coming to tell me what it was all about. Say  to General Jackson that he knows just as well what to do with the enemy  as I do.\"    Jackson said of Lee, when it was intimated by some, at the time he first  took command, that he was slow:    \"He is cautious. He ought to be. But he is NOT slow. Lee is a  phenomenon. He is the only man whom I would follow blindfold.\"    As the story of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23259"],[0,"Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit (#17)"],[1,"preliminary work with half round and  round rasps and files before sandpaper, glass and polishing powders give  a finish. If the tips and the higher surfaces of the balance are  completely polished, the rest smoothed down somewhat and the entire  horns rubbed with a little oil the effect will be good.    [Illustration: A Good Shield Pattern]    [Illustration: Back of block]    Shields are made in various patterns, woods and sizes, the average pair  of deer antlers requiring one 7/8 inch thick and about 8x10 or 10x12  inches. Oak in a dull oil finish always looks well, though walnut,  cherry, ash and birch are much used. If near a woodworking shop provided  with a jigsaw and moulder they will turn them out in any pattern you  may wish. The Ogee moulded edge is to be preferred.    If you have to make it yourself, a simple diamond, square or oval panel  with rounded or beveled edge will be sufficiently difficult.    Arrange the antlers in place on the shield and mark lightly around the  base, remove them and drill three holes for screws. Countersink for the  heads on the back of the shield and so fasten the antlers in place. For  light horns a brass screw-eye at the top of shield is used to hang them,  but heavy moose and elk antlers require an iron plate in back of shield,  let in flush across the top of a perpendicular groove to catch a hook or  head of a heavy nail in the wall.    [Illustration: DEER ANTLERS; ELK FEET; BISON HORNS.]    If the antlers are to be used as a rack for hats, guns or rods, two  screw-eyes or plates will be necessary to prevent turning.    There are other methods of mounting horns and antlers, but I have found  the above to be the most substantial and neat, and not very difficult.          CHAPTER XIX.    MOUNTING FEET AND HOOFS.      Many sportsmen now preserve the feet of their large game to have them  made up in various articles of use and ornament which they can  distribute among their friends or use in their own homes. Some of these  articles are gun and rod racks, furniture legs and feet, ink wells,  match, cigar and ash holders, thermometers, paper weights, umbrella and  cane handles.    [Illustration: WOODEN CROOK FOR DEER FOOT.]    It goes without saying that for such things as racks, furniture legs,  handles and thermometer mounts the leg skin attached to the hoof should  be left six or more inches in length while for ink wells, etc., it may  be shorter.    [Illustration: SKINNED DEER FOOT.]    [Illustration: DEER FOOT INK WELL.]    In fairly cool weather the feet and lower legs of deer will keep for  some days without skinning as they contain but a small amount of flesh.  Still it is safest and but the work of a few minutes to split them up  the backs, skin down to the toe joints and cut them off there. Dry them  with or without salting and they are easily packed up to carry home or  send to the taxidermist. If one foot and shank is received in the flesh  it will aid in mounting them up as racks, furniture legs, etc., as for  such purposes the skin is mounted over a piece of wood of the size and  shape of the skinned leg. For preparing feet for racks and handles it is  well to supply yourself with a number of natural crooks of about the  size of a deer's leg and nearly of a right angle. Sassafras, gum or some  soft wood work up easiest. When skinned place in pickle or give foot  coating of arsenic and alum--pickle is best. Be sure and leave enough  skin attached to hoof; a little experience will teach you this. Now  remove foot from bath, rinse well and sew up same as far as the claws;  next bore a hole through the claws from inside of claws, where it will  not show. Get two wire nails and nail these claws to a board, as shown  in A. Now arrange the hoofs as shown in illustration and put a screw  into each from underneath, to hold them down (B), or you can nail a  cleat across them by nailing to the block on each side of hoof; the idea  is to get these parts firmly placed in position. Now finish sewing up  the skin and stuff it full of chopped excelsior, shaping the foot as you  proceed. Now drive a long nail against back side of foot to keep it from  sagging (C). Allow the foot to thoroughly dry.    [Illustration: DEER FOOT THERMOMETER.]    When dry remove excelsior and cut off surplus skin around top and the  foot is ready for an ink well, match safe, ash tray or paper weight, as  they all go on the same way. Mix up some plaster of paris in water and  run the foot full and place the ink well or other fitting in place and  allow the plaster to \"set\" and the foot is finished. If you wish a pen  rest you can now place it in position. In setting up thermometers remove  bone to hoof and whittle out a stick shape of bones removed. Coat inside  of skin with arsenic and alum and place stick in position and sew up  skin. Put on metal cap at top and tack on thermometer. For hooks on  racks, work up a stick with crook into the approximate size and shape of  the deer's leg with the foot bent at right angles. It had best be a  little small so it can have a coating of clay or other modelling  material to make the skin fit it perfectly. Sew up as for thermometer.  When dry fasten to the rack by inserting in a square or oval hole and  wedging at the back.    For furniture legs the feet are turned out in natural position on wooden  legs, and fastened by bolting or screwing to small tables, stools, or  screens. As handles for canes and umbrellas, treat the same as for hooks  and leave the wood long to form a dowel which is glued or inserted in  cane or umbrella, a metal band covering the end of the skin. I have  referred in this chapter to deer feet, but those of elk, caribou and  moose are also used and suitable fittings in nickel and silver plate are  supplied in various sizes by dealers.    [Illustration: DEER FOOT HAT RACK.]    If you wish the hoofs mottled (they look best that way) file same until  you get to the \"quick,\" which is light in color and gives the foot a  very attractive appearance. Smooth down with sandpaper or edge of glass.  Oil a rag and dip it in powdered pumice stone and rub hoof vigorously a  few moments, and you will have a beautiful polish.    The smaller articles are complete as they are or may be mounted, ink  wells, etc., on round, and thermometers on long panels of variously  finished woods. Many nice articles may thus be made from what is usually  considered worthless offal.    [Illustration: MOOSE FOOT JEWEL CASE.]          CHAPTER XX.    MOUNTING FISH.      These with reptiles are most difficult to preserve with any success by  the ordinary methods. There are some individuals which it is impossible  for the taxidermist to prepare the skins of, so as to retain a natural  appearance for any length of time. They can only be represented by casts  painted to the best of the artist's ability.    Most of the varieties of medium and large game fishes can be mounted by  the average taxidermist and it is with these we are mostly concerned.  There are almost as many methods of mounting fish as there are  operators, each having some pet kink of real or fancied superiority.    As often as otherwise fish are mounted in the medallion style, with one  side only showing. This is especially adapted to display on walls and  panels. For filling material everything from sawdust to plaster has been  employed but as good results as any are secured by a hard core of the  approximate size of the skinned fish, coated with some plastic  substances which is moulded into shape through the skin.    In skinning some fish the scales must be protected by pasting thin paper  over them but ordinarily it is sufficient to keep the skin wet and not  allow it to dry out until it is complete. A piece of oil cloth is good  to work on in skinning fish or birds either. Some taxidermists have a  large pane of glass set flush in a table top for this purpose.    [Illustration: FISH BEDDED IN SAND WITH PLASTER MOULD OF UPPER HALF.]    With a freshly caught fish at hand which is to be made into a medallion  the process is about as follows: Before skinning lay it flat on one side  on a piece of soft wood board of the proper thickness and mark out its  outline. Though only one side of the mounted fish shows, a little more  than precisely one half is preserved in order to include the tail, the  vertical and dorsal fins and also to give an appearance of rotundity.    Leaving this margin all around, the skin is cut away from the side  which, on account of damage or other reason, is selected for the back.  The head must be cut through with chisel or a fine saw. Severing the  bones at the base of the fins with the scissors the whole body is  removed by cutting the spinal column at its junction with the skull.    In skinning fish you will note a white layer, like tin foil, which gives  the fish its silvery color. Do not disturb this if possible. Remove all  surplus flesh, cut away the gills and interior of head and if at all  greasy (what fish is not) treat to a bath in gasoline. Use absorbent,  sawdust or meal to remove oily gasoline, drop in alcohol or formaldehyde  solution while the body is prepared. To do this cut out the board by the  outline on it with a short bevel on the back and the other side the full  shape of the fish. The whole form is slightly diminished, however, to  allow for a coating of clay. This is applied after the skin has been  removed from the solution and poisoned.    When a good fit is secured the skin is fastened in place by sewing from  top to bottom, across the back board, or if large, nailing the edges to  the board. The fins which have been kept wet are to be spread; each  clamped with two pieces of pasteboard. On very large fish spring clothes  pins may be used to clamp the fins, for small ones pins forced through  both thicknesses, _outside_ the fins.    Sponge the fish off carefully to remove all clay or other dirt and give  it a coat of rather thin white varnish. This"]]]
