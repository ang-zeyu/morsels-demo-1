'You  interrupted the message I was receiving. I shall not get it at all  now.'    \"'Miriam,' I implored. 'I so wish my dear girl, that you wouldn't talk  so. It makes people think there is something queer about you. Who in  the world was sending you a message, as you call it?'    \"'Sidney,' said Miriam simply.    \"'Nonsense!'    \"'You think it is nonsense because you don't understand it,' was her  calm response.    \"I recall another event was when some caller dropped in and we had  drifted into a discussion about ghosts and the like--and I've no doubt  we all talked some delicious nonsense. Miriam said nothing at the  time, but when we were alone I asked her what she thought of it.    \"'I thought you were all merely talking against time,' she retorted  evasively.    \"'But, Miriam, do you really think it is possible for ghosts--'    \"'I detest that word!'    \"'Well, spirits then--to return after death, or to appear to anyone  apart from the flesh?'    \"'I will tell you what I know. If anything were to happen to  Sidney--if he were to die or be killed--he would come to me himself  and tell me.'    \"One day Miriam came down to lunch looking pale and worried. After  Dick went out, I asked her if anything were wrong.    \"'Something has happened to Sidney,' she replied, 'some painful  accident--I don't know what.'    \"'How do you know?' I cried. Then, as she looked at me strangely, I  added hastily, 'You haven't been receiving any more unearthly  messages, have you? Surely, Miriam, you are not so foolish as to  really believe in that!'    \"'I know,' she answered quickly. 'Belief or disbelief has nothing to  do with it. Yes, I have had a message. I know that some accident has  happened to Sidney--painful and inconvenient but not particularly  dangerous. I do not know what it is. Sidney will write me that. He  writes when it is absolutely necessary.'    \"'Aerial communication isn't perfected yet then?' I said  mischievously. But, observing how really worried she seemed, I added,  'Don't fret, Miriam. You may be mistaken.'    \"Well, two days afterwards she got a note from her lover--the first I  had ever known her to receive--in which he said he had been thrown  from his horse and had broken his left arm. It had happened the very  morning Miriam received her message.    \"Miriam had been with us about eight months when one day she came into  my room hurriedly. She was very pale.    \"'Sidney is ill--dangerously ill. What shall I do?'    \"I knew she must have had another of those abominable messages--or  thought she had--and really, remembering the incident of the broken  arm, I couldn't feel as sceptical as I pretended to. I tried to cheer  her, but did not succeed. Two hours later she had a telegram from her  lover's college chum, saying that Mr. Claxton was dangerously ill with  typhoid fever.    \"I was quite alarmed about Miriam in the days that followed. She  grieved and fretted continually. One of her troubles was that she  received no more messages; she said it was because Sidney was too ill  to send them. Anyhow, she had to content herself with the means of  communication used by ordinary mortals.    \"Sidney's mother, who had gone to nurse him, wrote every day, and at  last good news came. The crisis was over and the doctor in attendance  thought Sidney would recover. Miriam seemed like a new creature then,  and rapidly recovered her spirits.    \"For a week reports continued favourable. One night we went to the  opera to hear a celebrated prima donna. When we returned home Miriam  and I were sitting in her room, chatting over the events of the  evening.    \"Suddenly she sat straight up with a sort of convulsive shudder, and  at the same time--you may laugh if you like--the most horrible feeling  came over me. I didn't see anything, but I just felt that there was  something or someone in the room besides ourselves.    \"Miriam was gazing straight before her. She rose to her feet and held  out her hands.    \"'Sidney!' she said.    \"Then she fell to the floor in a dead faint.    \"I screamed for Dick, rang the bell and rushed to her.    \"In a few minutes the whole household was aroused, and Dick was off  posthaste for the doctor, for we could not revive Miriam from her  death-like swoon. She seemed as one dead. We worked over her for  hours. She would come out of her faint for a moment, give us an  unknowing stare and go shudderingly off again.    \"The doctor talked of some fearful shock, but I kept my own counsel.  At dawn Miriam came back to life at last. When she and I were left  alone, she turned to me.    \"'Sidney is dead,' she said quietly. 'I saw him--just before I  fainted. I looked up, and he was standing between me and you. He had  come to say farewell.'    \"What could I say? Almost while we were talking a telegram came. He  was dead--he had died at the very hour at which Miriam had seen him.\"    Mrs. Sefton paused, and the lunch bell rang.    \"What do you think of it?\" she queried as we rose.    \"Honestly, I don't know what I think of it,\" I answered frankly.          Miss Calista's Peppermint Bottle      Miss Calista was perplexed. Her nephew, Caleb Cramp, who had been her  right-hand man for years and whom she had got well broken into her  ways, had gone to the Klondike, leaving her to fill his place with the  next best man; but the next best man was slow to appear, and meanwhile  Miss Calista was looking about her warily. She could afford to wait a  while, for the crop was all in and the fall ploughing done, so that  the need of a successor to Caleb was not as pressing as it might  otherwise have been. There was no lack of applicants, such as they  were. Miss Calista was known to be a kind and generous mistress,  although she had her \"ways,\" and insisted calmly and immovably upon  wholehearted compliance with them. She had a small, well-cultivated  farm and a comfortable house, and her hired men lived in clover. Caleb  Cramp had been perfection after his kind, and Miss Calista did not  expect to find his equal. Nevertheless, she set up a certain standard  of requirements; and although three weeks, during which Miss Calista  had been obliged to put up with the immature services of a neighbour's  boy, had elapsed since Caleb's departure, no one had as yet stepped  into his vacant and coveted shoes.    Certainly Miss Calista was somewhat hard to please, but she was not  thinking of herself as she sat by her front window in the chilly  November twilight. Instead, she was musing on the degeneration of  hired men, and reflecting that it was high time the wheat was  thrashed, the house banked, and sundry other duties attended to.    Ches Maybin had been up that afternoon to negotiate for the vacant  place, and had offered to give satisfaction for smaller wages than  Miss Calista had ever paid. But he had met with a brusque refusal,  scarcely as civil as Miss Calista had bestowed on drunken Jake Stinson  from the Morrisvale Road.    Not that Miss Calista had any particular prejudice against Ches  Maybin, or knew anything positively to his discredit. She was simply  unconsciously following the example of a world that exerts itself to  keep a man down when he is down and prevent all chance of his rising.  Nothing succeeds like success, and the converse of this is likewise  true--that nothing fails like failure. There was not a person in  Cooperstown who would not have heartily endorsed Miss Calista's  refusal.    Ches Maybin was only eighteen, although he looked several years older,  and although no flagrant misdoing had ever been proved against him,  suspicion of such was not wanting. He came of a bad stock, people said  sagely, adding that what was bred in the bone was bound to come out  in the flesh. His father, old Sam Maybin, had been a shiftless and  tricky rascal, as everybody knew, and had ended his days in the  poorhouse. Ches's mother had died when he was a baby, and he had come  up somehow, in a hand-to-mouth fashion, with all the cloud of heredity  hanging over him. He was always looked at askance, and when any  mischief came to light in the village, it was generally fastened on  him as a convenient and handy scapegoat. He was considered sulky and  lazy, and the local prophets united in predicting a bad end for him  sooner or later; and, moreover, diligently endeavoured by their  general treatment of him to put him in a fair way to fulfil their  predictions. Miss Calista, when she had shut Chester Maybin out into  the chill gloom of the November dusk, dismissed him from her thoughts.  There were other things of more moment to her just then than old Sam  Maybin's hopeful son.    There was nobody in the house but herself, and although this was  neither alarming nor unusual, it was unusual--and Miss Calista  considered it alarming--that the sum of five hundred dollars should at  that very moment be in the upper right-hand drawer of the sideboard,  which sum had been up to the previous day safe in the coffers of the  Millageville bank. But certain unfavourable rumours were in course of  circulation about that same institution, and Miss Calista, who was  nothing if not prudent, had gone to the bank that very morning and  withdrawn her deposit. She intended to go over to Kerrytown the very  next day and deposit it in the Savings Bank there. Not another day  would she keep it in the house, and, indeed, it worried her to think  she must keep it even for the night, as she had told Mrs. Galloway  that afternoon during a neighbourly back-yard chat.    \"Not but what it's safe enough,\" she said, \"for not a soul but you  knows I've got it. But I'm not used to have so much by me, and there  are always tramps going round. It worries me somehow. I wouldn't give  it a thought if Caleb was here. I s'pose being all alone makes me  nervous.\"    Miss Calista was still rather nervous when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24875"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1904 (#17)"],[1,"hat's a good  girl.\"    Prue, with set face, had brought the lantern, resolutely choking back  the words of fear and protest that rushed to her lips. They hurried  down to the shore and Natty sprang into the little skiff he used for  rowing. He hastily lashed the lantern in the stern, cast loose the  painter, and lifted the oars.    \"I'll be back as soon as possible,\" he called to Prue. \"Wait here for  me.\"    In a minute the shore was out of sight, and Natty found himself alone  in the black fog, with no guide but the cries for help, which already  were becoming fainter. They seemed to come from the direction of  Little Bear, and thither Natty rowed. It was a tough pull, and the  water was rough enough for the little dory. But Natty had been at home  with the oars from babyhood, and his long training and tough sinews  stood him in good stead now. Steadily and intrepidly he rowed along.  The water grew rougher as he passed out from the shelter of Blue Point  into the channel between the latter and Little Bear. The cries were  becoming very faint. What if he should be too late? He bent to the  oars with all his energy. Presently, by the smoother water, he knew he  must be in the lea of Little Bear. The cries sounded nearer. He must  already have rowed nearly a mile. The next minute he shot around a  small headland and right before him, dimly visible in the faint light  cast by the lantern through the fog, was an upturned boat with two men  clinging to it, one on each side, evidently almost exhausted. Natty  rowed cautiously up to the one nearest him, knowing that he must be  wary lest the grip of the drowning man overturn his own light skiff.    \"Let go when I say,\" he shouted, \"and don't--grab--anything, do you  hear? Don't--grab. Now, let go.\"    The next minute the man lay in the dory, dragged over the stern by  Netty's grip on his collar.    \"Lie still,\" ordered Natty, clutching the oars. To row around the  overturned boat, amid the swirl of water about her, was a task that  taxed Netty's skill and strength to the utmost. The other man was  dragged in over the bow, and with a gasp of relief Natty pulled away  from the sinking boat. Once clear of her he could not row for a few  minutes; he was shaking from head to foot with the reaction from  tremendous effort and strain.    \"This'll never do,\" he muttered. \"I'm not going to be a baby now. But  will I ever be able to row back?\"    Presently, however, he was able to grip his oars again and pull for  the lighthouse, whose beacon loomed dimly through the fog like a great  blur of whiter mist. The men, obedient to his orders, lay quietly  where he had placed them, and before long Natty was back again at the  lighthouse landing, where Prue was waiting, wild with anxiety. The men  were helped out and assisted up to the lighthouse, where Natty went to  hunt up dry clothes for them, and Prue flew about to prepare hot  drinks.    \"To think that that child saved us!\" exclaimed one of the men. \"Why, I  didn't think a grown man had the strength to do what he did. He is  your brother, I suppose, Miss Miller. You have another brother, I  think?\"    \"Oh, yes--Everett--but he is away,\" explained Prue. \"We heard your  shouts and Natty insisted on going at once to your rescue.\"    \"Well, he came just in time. I couldn't have held on another  minute--was so done up I couldn't have moved or spoken all the way  here even if he hadn't commanded me to keep perfectly still.\"    Natty returned at this moment and exclaimed, \"Why, it is Mr. Barr. I  didn't recognize you before.\"    \"Barr it is, young man. This gentleman is my friend, Mr. Blackmore. We  have been celebrating Victoria Day by a shooting tramp over Little  Bear. We hired a boat from Ford at the Harbour Head this morning--the  _Cockawee_, he called her--and sailed over. I don't know much about  running a boat, but Blackmore here thinks he does. We were at the  other side of the island when the fog came up. We hurried across it,  but it was almost dark when we reached our boat. We sailed around the  point and then the boat just simply upset--don't know why--\"    \"But I know why,\" interrupted Natty indignantly. \"That _Cockawee_ does  nothing but upset. She has turned turtle twice out in the harbour in  fine weather. Ford was a rascal to let her to you. He might have known  what would happen. Why--why--it was almost murder to let you go!\"    \"I thought there must be something queer about her,\" declared Mr.  Blackmore. \"I do know how to handle a boat despite my friend's gibe,  and there was no reason why she should have upset like that. That Ford  ought to be horsewhipped.\"    Thanks to Prue's stinging hot decoctions of black currant drink, the  two gentlemen were no worse for their drenching and exposure, and the  next morning Natty took them to the mainland in the _Merry Maid_. When  he parted with them, Mr. Barr shook his hand heartily and said: \"Thank  you, my boy. You're a plucky youngster and a skilful one, too. Tell  your brother that if I can get the Blue Point lighthouse berth for him  I will, and as for yourself, you will always find a friend in me, and  if I can ever do anything for you I will.\"    Two weeks later Everett received an official document formally  appointing him keeper of Blue Point Island light. Natty carried the  news to the mainland, where it was joyfully received among the  fishermen.    \"Only right and fair,\" said Cooper Creasy. \"Blue Point without a  Miller to light up wouldn't seem the thing at all, that's what. And  it's nothing but Ev's doo.\"    \"Guess Natty had more to do with it than Ev,\" said Adam, perpetrating  a very poor pun and being immensely applauded therefor. It keyed Will  Scott up to rival Adam.    \"You said that Irving had a pull and the Millers hadn't,\" he said  jocularly. \"But it looks as if 'twas Natty's pull did the business  after all--his pull over to Bear Island and back.\"    \"It was about a miracle that a boy could do what he did on such a  night,\" said Charles Macey.    \"Where's Ford?\" asked Natty uncomfortably. He hated to have his  exploit talked about.    \"Ford has cleared out,\" said Cooper, \"gone down to Summerside to go  into Tobe Meekins's factory there. Best thing he could do, that's  what. Folks here hadn't no use for him after letting that death trap  to them two men--even if they was Lib'rals. The _Cockawee_ druv ashore  on Little Bear, and there she's going to remain, I guess. D'ye want a  berth in my mackerel boat this summer, Natty?\"    \"I do,\" said Natty, \"but I thought you said you were full.\"    \"I guess I can make room for you,\" said Cooper. \"A boy with such grit  and muscle ain't to be allowed to go to seed on Blue Point, that's  what. Yesser, we'll make room for you.\"    And Natty's cup of happiness was full.          Penelope's Party Waist      \"It's perfectly horrid to be so poor,\" grumbled Penelope. Penelope did  not often grumble, but just now, as she sat tapping with one  pink-tipped finger her invitation to Blanche Anderson's party, she  felt that grumbling was the only relief she had.    Penelope was seventeen, and when one is seventeen and cannot go to a  party because one hasn't a suitable dress to wear, the world is very  apt to seem a howling wilderness.    \"I wish I could think of some way to get you a new waist,\" said Doris,  with what these sisters called \"the poverty pucker\" coming in the  centre of her pretty forehead. \"If your black skirt were sponged and  pressed and re-hung, it would do very well.\"    Penelope saw the poverty pucker and immediately repented with all her  impetuous heart having grumbled. That pucker came often enough without  being brought there by extra worries.    \"Well, there is no use sitting here sighing for the unattainable,\" she  said, jumping up briskly. \"I'd better be putting my grey matter into  that algebra instead of wasting it plotting for a party dress that I  certainly can't get. It's a sad thing for a body to lack brains when  she wants to be a teacher, isn't it? If I could only absorb algebra  and history as I can music, what a blessing it would be! Come now,  Dorrie dear, smooth that pucker out. Next year I shall be earning a  princely salary, which we can squander on party gowns at will--if  people haven't given up inviting us by that time, in sheer despair of  ever being able to conquer our exclusiveness.\"    Penelope went off to her detested algebra with a laugh, but the pucker  did not go out of Doris' forehead. She wanted Penelope to go to that  party.    Penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasn't gone anywhere,  thought the older sister wistfully. She is getting discouraged over  those examinations and she needs just a good, jolly time to hearten  her up. If it could only be managed!    But Doris did not see how it could. It took every cent of her small  salary as typewriter in an uptown office to run their tiny  establishment and keep Penelope in school dresses and books. Indeed,  she could not have done even that much if they had not owned their  little cottage. Next year it would be easier if Penelope got through  her examinations successfully, but just now there was absolutely not a  spare penny.    \"It is hard to be poor. We are a pair of misfits,\" said Doris, with a  patient little smile, thinking of Penelope's uncultivated talent for  music and her own housewifely gifts, which had small chance of  flowering out in her business life.    Doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them  all the next day. So, it must be confessed, did Penelope, though she  would not have admitted it for the world.    When Doris reached home the next evening, she found Penelope hovering  over a bulky parcel on the sitting-room table.    \"I'm so glad you've come,\" she said with an exaggerated gasp of  relief. \"I really don't think my curiosity could have borne the strain  for another five minutes. The expressman brought this parcel an hour  ago, and there's a letter for you"]]]
