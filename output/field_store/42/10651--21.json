Wringhim came rushing through the thicket impetuously, to the very spot  where Mrs. Logan lay squatted. She held the wrapping close about her  head, but he tore it off and discovered her. \"The curse of God be on  thee!\" said he. \"What fiend has brought thee here, and for what purpose  art thou come? But, whatever has brought thee, I have thee!\" and with  that he seized her by the throat. The two women, when they heard what  jeopardy they were in from such a wretch, had squatted among the  underwood at a small distance from each other, so that he had never  observed Mrs. Calvert; but, no sooner had he seized her benefactor,  than, like a wild cat, she sprung out of the thicket, and had both  hands fixed at his throat, one of them twisted in his stock, in a  twinkling. She brought him back-over among the brushwood, and the two,  fixing on him like two harpies, mastered him with case. Then indeed was  he woefully beset. He deemed for a while that his friend was at his  back, and, turning his bloodshot eyes towards the path, he attempted to  call; but there was no friend there, and the women cut short his cries  by another twist of his stock. \"Now, gallant and rightful Laird of  Dalcastle,\" said Mrs. Logan, \"what hast thou to say for thyself? Lay  thy account to dree the weird thou hast so well earned. Now shalt thou  suffer due penance for murdering thy brave and only brother.\"    \"Thou liest, thou hag of the pit! I touched not my brother's life.\"    \"I saw thee do it with these eyes that now look thee in the face; ay,  when his back was to thee, too, and while he was hotly engaged with thy  friend,\" said Mrs. Calvert.    \"I heard thee confess it again and again this same hour,\" said Mrs.  Logan.    \"Ay, and so did I,\" said her companion. \"Murder will out, though the  Almighty should lend hearing to the ears of the willow, and speech to  the seven tongues of the woodriff.\"    \"You are liars and witches!\" said he, foaming with rage, \"and creatures  fitted from the beginning for eternal destruction. I'll have your bones  and your blood sacrificed on your cursed altars! O Gil-Martin!  Gil-Martin! Where art thou now? Here, here is the proper food for  blessed vengeance! Hilloa!\"    There was no friend, no Gil-Martin there to hear or assist him: he was  in the two women's mercy, but they used it with moderation. They  mocked, they tormented, and they threatened him; but, finally, after  putting him in great terror, they bound his hands behind his back, and  his feet fast with long straps of garters which they chanced to have in  their baskets, to prevent him from pursuing them till they were out of  his reach. As they left him, which they did in the middle of the path,  Mrs. Calvert said: \"We could easily put an end to thy sinful life, but  our hands shall be free of thy blood. Nevertheless thou art still in  our power, and the vengeance of thy country shall overtake thee, thou  mean and cowardly murderer, ay, and that more suddenly than thou art  aware!\"    The women posted to Edinburgh; and as they put themselves under the  protection of an English merchant, who was journeying thither with  twenty horses laden, and armed servants, so they had scarcely any  conversation on the road. When they arrived at Mrs. Logan's house, then  they spoke of what they had seen and heard, and agreed that they had  sufficient proof to condemn young Wringhim, who they thought richly  deserved the severest doom of the law.    \"I never in my life saw any human being,\" said Mrs. Calvert, \"whom I  thought so like a fiend. If a demon could inherit flesh and blood, that  youth is precisely such a being as I could conceive that demon to be.  The depth and the malignity of his eye is hideous. His breath is like  the airs from a charnel house, and his flesh seems fading from his  bones, as if the worm that never dies were gnawing it away already.\"    \"He was always repulsive, and every way repulsive,\" said the other,  \"but he is now indeed altered greatly to the worse. While we were  hand-fasting him, I felt his body to be feeble and emaciated; but yet I  know him to be so puffed up with spiritual pride that I believe he  weens every one of his actions justified before God, and, instead of  having stings of conscience for these, he takes great merit to himself  in having effected them. Still my thoughts are less about him than the  extraordinary being who accompanies him. He does everything with so  much ease and indifference, so much velocity and effect, that all  bespeak him an adept in wickedness. The likeness to my late hapless  young master is so striking that I can hardly believe it to be a chance  model; and I think he imitates him in everything, for some purpose or  some effect on his sinful associate. Do you know that he is so like in  every lineament, look, and gesture, that, against the clearest light of  reason, I cannot in my mind separate the one from the other, and have a  certain indefinable expression on my mind that they are one and the  same being, or that the one was a prototype of the other.\"    \"If there is an earthly crime,\" said Mrs. Calvert, \"for the due  punishment of which the Almighty may be supposed to subvert the order  of nature, it is fratricide. But tell me, dear friend, did you remark  to what the subtile and hellish villain was endeavouring to prompt the  assassin?\"    \"No, I could not comprehend it. My senses were altogether so bewildered  that I thought they had combined to deceive me, and I gave them no  credit.\"    \"Then bear me: I am almost certain he was using every persuasion to  induce him to make away with his mother; and I likewise conceive that I  heard the incendiary give his consent!\"    \"This is dreadful. Let us speak and think no more about it, till we see  the issue. In the meantime, let us do that which is our bounden  duty--go and divulge all that we know relating to this foul murder.\"    Accordingly the two women went to Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie, the  Lord justice Clerk (who was, I think, either uncle or grandfather to  young Drummond, who was outlawed and obliged to fly his country on  account of Colwan's death), and to that gentleman they related every  circumstance of what they had seen and heard. He examined Calvert very  minutely, and seemed deeply interested in her evidence--said he knew  she was relating the truth, and, in testimony of it, brought a letter  of young Drummond's from his desk, wherein that young gentleman, after  protesting his innocence in the most forcible terms, confessed having  been with such a woman in such a house, after leaving the company of  his friends; and that, on going home, Sir Thomas's servant had let him  in, in the dark, and from these circumstances he found it impossible to  prove an alibi. He begged of his relative, if ever an opportunity  offered, to do his endeavour to clear up that mystery, and remove the  horrid stigma from his name in his country, and among his kin, of  having stabbed a friend behind his back.    Lord Craigie, therefore, directed the two women to the proper  authorities, and, after hearing their evidence there, it was judged  proper to apprehend the present Laird of Dalcastle, and bring him to  his trial. But, before that, they sent the prisoner in the Tolbooth, he  who had seen the whole transaction along with Mrs. Calvert, to take a  view of Wringhim privately; and, his discrimination being so well known  as to be proverbial all over the land, they determined secretly to be  ruled by his report. They accordingly sent him on a pretended mission  of legality to Dalcastle, with orders to see and speak with the  proprietor, without giving him a hint what was wanted. On his return,  they examined him, and he told them that he found all things at the  place in utter confusion and dismay; that the lady of the place was  missing, and could not be found, dead or alive. On being asked if he  had ever seen the proprietor before, he looked astounded and unwilling  to answer. But it came out that he had; and that he had once seen him  kill a man on such a spot at such an hour.    Officers were then dispatched, without delay, to apprehend the monster,  and bring him to justice. On these going to the mansion, and inquiring  for him, they were told he was at home; on which they stationed guards,  and searched all the premises, but he was not to be found. It was in  vain that they overturned beds, raised floors, and broke open closets:  Robert Wringhim Colwan was lost once and for ever. His mother also was  lost; and strong suspicions attached to some of the farmers and house  servants to whom she was obnoxious, relating to her disappearance.    The Honourable Thomas Drummond became a distinguished officer in the  Austrian service, and died in the memorable year for Scotland, 1715;  and this is all with which history, justiciary records, and tradition,  furnish me relating to these matters.    I have now the pleasure of presenting my readers with an original  document of a most singular nature, and preserved for their perusal in  a still more singular manner. I offer no remarks on it, and make as few  additions to it, leaving everyone to judge for himself. We have heard  much of the rage of fanaticism in former days, but nothing to this.

[Illustration: _Fig. 111._ CIRCUIT WIRES IN DIRECT CURRENT DYNAMO]    Now, this change is just exactly what has happened in the wire (C), as  we have explained. The current attempts to reverse itself and start out  on business of its own, so to speak, with the result that when the  brushes (D and E) contact with the negative and positive terminals,  respectively, the surging current in the wire (C) is going in the  direction of the dart (H)--that is, while, in Fig. 110, the current  flows from the wire (C) into the positive terminal, and out of the  negative terminal into the wire (C), the conditions are exactly reversed  in Fig. 111. Here the current in wire C flows _into_ the negative (-)  terminal, and _from_ the positive (+) terminal into the wire C, so that  in either case the current will flow out of the brush D and into the  brush E, through the external circuit (G).    It will be seen, therefore, that in the direct-current motor, advantage  is taken of the surging, or back-and-forth movement, of the current to  pass it along in one direction, whereas in the alternating current no  such change in direction is attempted.    ALTERNATING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE POLES.--The alternating current,  owing to this surging movement, makes the poles alternately positive and  negative. To express this more clearly, supposing we take a line (A,  Fig. 112), which is called the zero line, or line of no electricity. The  current may be represented by the zigzag line (B). The lines (B) above  zero (A) may be designated as positive, and those below the line as  negative. The polarity reverses at the line A, goes up to D, which is  the maximum intensity or voltage above zero, and, when the current falls  and crosses the line A, it goes in the opposite direction to E, which is  its maximum voltage in the other direction. In point of time, if it  takes one second for the current to go from C to F, on the down line,  then it takes only a half second to go from C to G, so that the line A  represents the time, and the line H the intensity, a complete cycle  being formed from C, D, F, then through F, E, C, and so on.    [Illustration: _Fig. 112._ ALTERNATING POLARITY LINES]    HOW AN ALTERNATING DYNAMO IS MADE.--It is now necessary to apply these  principles in the construction of an alternating-current machine. Fig.  113 is a diagram representing the various elements, and the circuiting.    [Illustration: _Fig. 113._ ALTERNATING CURRENT DYNAMO]    Let A represent the ring or frame containing the inwardly projecting  field magnet cores (B). C is the shaft on which the armature revolves,  and this carries the wheel (D), which has as many radially disposed  magnet cores (E) as there are of the field magnet cores (B).    The shaft (C) also carries two pulleys with rings thereon. One of these  rings (F) is for one end of the armature winding, and the other ring  (G) for the other end of the armature wire.    THE WINDINGS.--The winding is as follows: One wire, as at H, is first  coiled around one magnet core, the turnings being to the right. The  outlet terminal of this wire is then carried to the next magnet core and  wound around that, in the opposite direction, and so on, so that the  terminal of the wire is brought out, as at I, all of these wires being  connected to binding posts (J, J'), to which, also, the working circuits  are attached.    THE ARMATURE WIRES.--The armature wires, in like manner, run from the  ring (G) to one armature core, being wound from right to left, then to  the next core, which is wound to the right, afterward to the next core,  which is wound to the left, and so on, the final end of the wire being  connected up with the other ring (F). The north (N) and the south (S)  poles are indicated in the diagram.    CHOKING COIL.--The self-induction in a current of this kind is utilized  in transmitting electricity to great distances. Wires offer resistance,  or they impede the flow of a current, as hereinbefore stated, so that it  is not economical to transmit a direct current over long distances. This  can be done more efficiently by means of the alternating current, which  is subject to far less loss than is the case with the direct current.  It affords a means whereby the flow of a current may be checked or  reduced without depending upon the resistance offered by the wire over  which it is transmitted. This is done by means of what is called a  choking coil. It is merely a coil of wire, wound upon an iron core, and  the current to be choked passes through the coil. To illustrate this,  let us take an arc lamp designed to use a 50-volt current. If a current  is supplied to it carrying 100 volts, it is obvious that there are 50  volts more than are needed. We must take care of this excess of 50 volts  without losing it, as would happen were we to locate a resistance of  some kind in the circuit. This result we accomplish by the introduction  of the choking coil, which has the effect of absorbing the excessive 50  volts, the action being due to its quality of self-induction, referred  to in the foregoing.    [Illustration: _Fig. 114._ CHOKING COIL]    In Fig. 114, A is the choking coil and B an arc lamp, connected up, in  series, with the choking coil.    THE TRANSFORMER.--It is more economical to transmit 10,000 volts a long  distance than 1,000 volts, because the lower the pressure, or the  voltage, the larger must be the conductor to avoid loss. It is for this  reason that 500 volts, or more, are used on electric railways. For  electric light purposes, where the current goes into dwellings, even  this is too high, so a transformer is used to take a high-voltage  current from the main line and transform it into a low voltage. This is  done by means of two distinct coils of wire, wound upon an iron core.    [Illustration: _Fig. 115._ A TRANSFORMER]    In Fig. 115 the core is O-shaped, so that a primary winding (A), from  the electrical source, can be wound upon one limb, and the secondary  winding (B) wound around the other limb. The wires, to supply the  lamps, run from the secondary coil. There is no electrical connection  between the two coils, but the action from the primary to the secondary  coil is solely by induction. When a current passes through the primary  coil, the surging movement, heretofore explained, is transmitted to the  iron core, and the iron core, in turn, transmits this electrical energy  to the secondary coil.    HOW THE VOLTAGE IS DETERMINED.--The voltage produced by the secondary  coil will depend upon several things, namely, the strength of the  magnetism transmitted to it; the rapidity, or periodicity of the  current, and the number of turns of wire around the coil. The voltage is  dependent upon the length of the winding. But the voltage may also be  increased, as well as decreased. If the primary has, we will say, 100  turns of wire, and has 200 volts, and the secondary has 50 turns of  wire, the secondary will give forth only one-half as much as the  primary, or 100 volts.    If, on the other hand, 400 volts would be required, the secondary should  have 200 turns in the winding.    VOLTAGE AND AMPERAGE IN TRANSFORMERS.--It must not be understood that,  by increasing the voltage in this way, we are getting that much more  electricity. If the primary coil, with 100 turns, produces a current of  200 volts and 50 amperes, which would be 200 x 50 = 10,000 watts, and  the secondary coil has 50 turns, we shall have 100 volts and 100  amperes: 100 (V.) x 100 (A.) = 10,000 watts. Or, if, on the other hand,  our secondary winding is composed of 200 turns, we shall have 400 volts  and 25 amperes, 400 (volts) x 25 (amperes) also gives 10,000 watts.    Necessarily, there will be some loss, but the foregoing is offered as  the theoretical basis of calculation.          CHAPTER XVI    ELECTRIC LIGHTING      The most important step in the electric field, after the dynamo had been  brought to a fairly workable condition, was its utilization to make  light. It was long known prior to the discovery of practical electric  dynamos, that the electric current would produce an intense heat.    Ordinary fuels under certain favorable conditions will produce a  temperature of 4,500 degrees of heat; but by means of the electric arc,  as high as six, eight and ten thousand degrees are available.    The fact that when a conductor, in an electric current, is severed, a  spark will follow the drawing part of the broken ends, led many  scientists to believe, even before the dynamo was in a practical shape,  that electricity, sooner or later, would be employed as the great  lighting agent.    When the dynamo finally reached a stage in development where its  operation could be depended on, and was made reversible, the first  active steps were taken to not only produce, but to maintain an arc  between two electrodes.    It would be difficult and tedious to follow out the first experiments  in detail, and it might, also, be useless, as information, in view of  the present knowledge of the science. A few steps in the course of the  development are, however, necessary to a complete understanding of the  subject.    Reference has been made in a previous chapter to what is called the  _Electric Arc_, produced by slightly separated conductors, across which  the electric current jumps, producing the brilliantly lighted area.    This light is produced by the combustion of the carbon of which the  electrodes are composed. Thus, the illumination is the result of  directly burning a fuel. The current, in passing from one electrode to  the other, through the gap, produces such an intense heat that the fuel  through which the current passes is consumed.    Carbon in a comparatively pure state is difficult to ignite, owing to  its great resistance to heat. At about 7,000"]]]
