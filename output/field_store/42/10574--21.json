But this statement  of Pliny contains a grain of truth. The stick, or club, was undoubtedly  the first weapon made use of by men in their combats with each other,  though the spear and the sword followed at a period long anterior to any  known in historical records.    But from the earliest ages men have sought to avoid hand-to-hand  conflicts, and to make skill supply the place of strength. In contests  with wild beasts this was indispensable. Nature had provided man with no  weapon with which he could contend against the boar's tusks, the lion's  teeth, or the tiger's paw. Hence, the substitution of missiles for  manual weapons, has been the end towards which ingenuity has been  constantly directed.    The conversion of the spear into the javelin, as it was the most  obvious, so probably it was the earliest step in advance. Close upon  this followed the sling, and last the arrow and the bow. The invention  of the latter weapon is ascribed by Pliny, in the chapter above cited,  to a son of Jupiter. In the days of Homer it was the weapon of the gods;  and thousands of years after, it was the pride and glory of the English  yeoman. The classical scholar will remember the description in the  fourth book of the Iliad, of the bow with which Pandaros shot at  Menelaus an arrow which would have sent to Hades the hero dear to Mars,  had not the daughter of Jove brushed it aside with her hand, as a mother  doth a fly from her sleeping child. The bow does not appear to have been  extensively used in later times in either the Greek or Roman armies. The  ferocious Spartan preferred the close combat with manual weapons, the  Athenian won his glory upon the sea, and it was with the pike that  Alexander overcame the hosts of Persia. The Cretans, who were the most  celebrated archers in Europe, sometimes formed a separate division in  the Grecian and afterward in the Roman armies. The Romans, however,  generally preferred heavy-armed troops. But it was a peculiarity of  Roman policy always to adopt every improvement in the art of war with  which they became acquainted, whether it originated with friend or foe.  Rome never let slip any opportunity to add to the efficiency of her  legions, and they repaid her care by carrying her eagles in triumph from  the Thames to the Euphrates, and from the Danube to the Nile.    It was in the west of Europe, and from about the eleventh to the  fifteenth century, that archery flourished in the greatest perfection.  The early chronicles are filled with the exploits of the English  archers, and old and young still read with delight those ballads which  tell of the wondrous achievements of \"Robin Hood and his merry men.\"  Indeed, with the name of that famous outlaw are connected all our ideas  of perfect skill in the use of the bow, and in the directions which in  his dying hour, he gave to his faithful man, \"Little John,\" we seem to  hear the dirge of archery itself:        \"Give me my bent bow in my hand,      And a broad arrow I'll let flee,      And where that arrow is taken up,      There shall my grave digg'd be.        \"And lay me a green sod under my head,      And another at my feet,      And lay my bent bow by my side,      Which was my music sweet.\"    We shall not stop to dwell on the defects of the bow. The great and  insuperable one was its want of power. The strength of a man was the  limit of its capacity, and something more was necessary to pierce the  ironclad breast of the knight. But, until the invention of gunpowder, it  stood at the head of missile engines.    When and where gunpowder was invented it is impossible now to ascertain.  It seems to be described in the pages of Roger Bacon, while many are of  opinion that the returning Crusaders brought it from the east. Certain  it is that it had been known in China for many centuries, and applied to  the blasting of rocks and other useful purposes, though never to the art  of war. But the latter application of it was made by the Europeans  almost contemporaneously with their knowledge of its properties, and for  war it has been chiefly employed until the present time. The invention  of cannon preceded by a century that of small-arms, and it was by a  gradual reduction in the size of the former that the latter were  produced. Barbour, in his metrical Life of Robert Bruce, says, that  cannon were used by Edward III. in his first campaign against the Scots,  in 1327. He calls them \"Crakys of war.\" They are also supposed to have  been employed by the French in the siege of Puy Guillaume, in 1338. But  the first use of them which rests on unimpeachable evidence, and which  seems to have been productive of much effect, was at the battle of  Cressy, in 1346. It is from this epoch that it is most usual to date the  employment of artillery. That day which witnessed the first efficient  use of a weapon destined to revolutionize the art of war, also witnessed  the most splendid achievements of the archers of England. The bowstrings  of the French had become useless by the dampness of the weather, while  those of the English, either on account of greater care or the different  material of which they were made, were uninjured. The cloth-yard arrows  of the English bowmen, directed with unerring skill, made terrible havoc  in the ranks of their enemies, while four pieces of artillery stationed  on a little hill contributed to their victory. The French troops had  none of them ever seen, and most of them never heard of such a weapon,  and the terror inspired by the noise and the smoke did more than the  balls to hasten their defeat.    The first cannons were rude in the extreme. They were made of bars of  iron hooped together like the staves of a barrel, and were larger at the  muzzle than at the breech. The size was very soon decreased, so that two  men could carry one, and fire it from a rest. The 400 cannon with which  Froissart said that the English besieged St. Malo, in 1378, were  probably of this kind. Nearly a century elapsed before small-arms were  invented. Sir S. Meyrick, to whom subsequent writers have been indebted  for most of their knowledge upon this subject, has given, upon the  authority of an eye-witness, the time and place of their invention. \"It  was in 1430,\" says Bilius, \"that they were contrived by the Lucquese,  when they were besieged by the Florentines.\" A French translation of  Quintus Curtius made by Vasqua de Lucene, a Portuguese, in 1468,  preserved among the Burney MSS. of the British Museum, exhibits in one  of its illuminations the earliest representation of hand fire-arms which  has yet been discovered. The following engraving is from a copy of this  illumination, contained in the Penny Cyclopaedia.    [Illustration: _B.d.E.K_.]    It will be observed that this gun much resembles one of those small lead  cannons with which patriotic boys, upon each return of our national  anniversary, manifest their appreciation of the blessings of liberty. It  was fastened to a stick, and fired by a match held in the hand. We  proceed to sketch the progress of improvement from this the first gun  until we reach the repeating rifle.    If we analyze the manipulation of fire-arms, it will be found to consist  of three principal operations--namely, to charge the piece, to direct it  toward the object of attack, and to discharge it by in some manner  igniting the powder; or more concisely, to load, take aim, and fire.  That gun with which these operations can be performed most safely,  accurately, and rapidly, is the best.    The process of loading has continued to be essentially the same from the  invention of the gun to the present time. The charge is put in at the  muzzle, and rammed down to the lower end of the barrel. At a very early  period, efforts were made to construct guns which would load at the  breech; but hitherto no such gun has been able to supplant those which  load at the muzzle. The great complication of their parts, their  liability to get out of repair, their insecurity, and the long practice  required to learn their use, have been among the reasons which have  prevented any of these inventions from being adopted. Hence it is that  the muskets with which our soldiers are armed at the present day,  possess no advantage in this respect over the rude little cannon  fastened to the end of a stick, used by the soldiers of Europe four  centuries ago. But in other respects the progress of invention has been  steady and secure.    With the gun represented in the above engraving it was impossible to  take aim. Being perfectly straight, it could not be brought in the  range of the eye. The most that could be expected was, that by pointing  it in the direction of the enemy, it might chance to hit some one, in a  crowd.    The inconveniences attending the discharge of the piece were almost as  great. A puff of wind, or the slightest motion of the soldier himself,  would throw the priming from the touch-hole, and it is almost  unnecessary to add, that in rainy or even very damp weather, such a gun  was utterly useless. The first step in improvement was to place the  touch-hole on the right side of the barrel instead of upon the top, and  to attach a small pan which held the priming. By this means the priming  was kept from being blown away by the wind, though scarce any other  advantage was attained.    About the year 1475 a great advance was made by the invention of the  _arquebus_ or _bow-gun_. A spring let loose by a trigger threw the  match, which was fastened to it, forward, into the pan which contained  the priming.

CHAPTER IX.    FROM THE END OF THE PERSIAN WARS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PELOPONNESIAN  WAR, B.C. 479-431.    The Athenians, on their return to Attica, after the defeat of the  Persians, found their city ruined and their country desolate. They  began to rebuild their city on a larger scale than before, and to  fortify it with a wall.  Those allies to whom the increasing maritime  power of Athens was an object of suspicion, and especially the  AEginetans, to whom it was more particularly formidable, beheld her  rising fortifications with dismay.  They endeavoured to inspire the  Lacedaemonians with their fears, and urged them to arrest the work.  But though Sparta shared the jealousy of the allies, she could not with  any decency interfere by force to prevent a friendly city from  exercising a right inherent in all independent states.  She assumed  therefore the hypocritical garb of an adviser and counsellor.  Concealing her jealousy under the pretence of zeal for the common  interests of Greece, she represented to the Athenians that, in the  event of another Persian invasion, fortified towns would serve the  enemy for camps and strongholds, as Thebes had done in the last war;  and proposed that the Athenians should not only desist from completing  their own fortifications, but help to demolish those which already  existed in other towns.    The object of the proposal was too transparent to deceive so acute a  statesman as Themistocles.  Athens was not yet, however, in a condition  to incur the danger of openly rejecting it; and he therefore advised  the Athenians to dismiss the Spartan envoys with the assurance that  they would send ambassadors to Sparta to explain their views.  He then  caused himself to be appointed one of these ambassadors; and setting  off straightway for Sparta, directed his colleagues to linger behind as  long as possible.  At Sparta, the absence of his colleagues, at which  he affected to be surprised, afforded him an excuse for not demanding  an audience of the ephors.  During the interval thus gained, the whole  population of Athens, of both sexes and every age, worked day and night  at the walls, which, when the other ambassadors at length arrived at  Sparta, had attained a height sufficient to afford a tolerable defence.  Meanwhile the suspicions of the Spartans had been more than once  aroused by messages from the AEginetans respecting the progress of the  walls.  Themistocles, however, positively denied their statements; and  urged the Spartans to send messengers of their own to Athens in order  to learn the true state of affairs, at the same time instructing the  Athenians to detain them as hostages for the safety of himself and  colleagues. When there was no longer any motive for concealment,  Themistocles openly avowed the progress of the works, and his intention  of securing the independence of Athens, and enabling her to act for  herself.  The walls being now too far advanced to be easily taken, the  Spartans found themselves compelled to acquiesce, and the works were  completed without further hindrance.    Having thus secured the city from all danger of an immediate attack,  Themistocles pursued his favourite project of rendering Athens the  greatest maritime and commercial power of Greece.  He erected a town  round the harbour of Piraeus, distant between four and five miles from  Athens, and enclosed it with a wall as large in extent as the city  itself, but of vastly greater height and thickness.  Meanwhile an event  occurred which secured more firmly than ever the maritime supremacy of  Athens, by transferring to her the command of the allied fleet.    In the year after the battle of Plataea a fleet had been fitted out and  placed under the command of the Spartan regent, Pausanias, in order to  carry on the war against the Persians. After delivering most of the  Grecian towns in Cyprus from the Persians, this armament sailed up the  Bosporus and laid siege to Byzantium, which was garrisoned by a large  Persian force.  The town surrendered after a protracted siege; but it  was during this expedition that the conduct of the Spartan commander  struck a fatal blow at the interests of his country.    The immense booty, as well as the renown, which Pausanias had acquired  at Plataea, had filled him with pride and ambition. After the capture  of Byzantium he despatched a letter to Xerxes, offering to marry the  king's daughter, and to bring Sparta and the rest of Greece under his  dominion.  Xerxes was highly delighted with this letter, and sent a  reply in which he urged Pausanias to pursue his project night and day,  and promised to supply him with all the money and troops that might be  needful for its execution.  But the childish vanity of Pausanias  betrayed his plot before it was ripe for execution.  Elated by the  confidence of Xerxes, and by the money with which he was lavishly  supplied, he acted as if he had already married the Great King's  daughter.  He assumed the Persian dress; he made a progress through  Thrace, attended by Persian and Egyptian guards; and copied, in the  luxury of his table and the dissoluteness of his manners, the example  of his adopted country.  Above all, he offended the allies by his  haughty reserve and imperiousness. His designs were now too manifest to  escape attention.  His proceedings reached the ears of the Spartans,  who sent out Dorcis to supersede him.  Disgusted by the insolence of  Pausanias, the Ionians serving in the combined Grecian fleet addressed  themselves to Aristides, whose manners formed a striking contrast to  those of the Spartan leader, and begged him to assume the command.  This request was made precisely at the time when Pausanias was  recalled; and accordingly, when Dorcis arrived, he found Aristides in  command of the combined fleet (B.C. 478).    This event was not a mere empty question about a point of honour. It  was a real revolution, terminated by a solemn league, of which Athens  was to be the head.  Aristides took the lead in the matter, for which  his proverbial justice and probity eminently qualified him.  The league  obtained the name of \"the Confederacy of Delos,\" from its being  arranged that deputies of the allies belonging to it should meet  periodically for deliberation in the temple of Apollo and Artemis  (Diana) in that island.  Each state was assessed in a certain  contribution, either of money or ships, as proposed by the Athenians  and ratified by the synod.  The assessment was intrusted to Aristides,  whose impartiality was universally applauded.  Of the details, however,  we only know that the first assessment amounted to 460 talents (about  106,000L sterling), that certain officers called Hellenotamiae were  appointed by the Athenians to collect and administer the contributions,  and that Delos was the treasury.    Such was the origin of the Confederacy of Delos.  Soon after its  formation Aristides was succeeded in the command of the combined fleet  by Cimon, the son of Miltiades.    Pausanias, on his return to Sparta, seems to have been acquitted of any  definite charges; but he continued his correspondence with Persia, and  an accident at length afforded convincing proofs of his guilt.  A  favourite slave, to whom he had intrusted a letter to the Persian  satrap at Sardis, observed with dismay that none of the messengers  employed in this service had ever returned. Moved by these fears, he  broke the seal and read the letter, and finding his suspicions of the  fate that awaited him confirmed, he carried the document to the ephors.  But in ancient states the testimony of a slave was always regarded with  suspicion.  The ephors refused to believe the evidence offered to them  unless confirmed by their own ears.  For this purpose they directed him  to plant himself as a suppliant in a sacred grove near Cape Taenarus,  in a hut behind which two of their body might conceal themselves.  Pausanias, as they had expected, anxious at the step taken by his  slave, hastened to the spot to question him about it.  The conversation  which ensued, and which was overheard by the ephors, rendered the guilt  of Pausanias no longer doubtful. They now determined to arrest him on  his return to Sparta.  They met him in the street near the temple of  Athena Chalcioecus (of the Brazen House), when Pausanias, either  alarmed by his guilty conscience, or put on his guard by a secret  signal from one of the ephors, turned and fled to the temple, where he  took refuge in a small chamber belonging to the building.  From this  sanctuary it was unlawful to drag him; but the ephors caused the doors  to be built up and the roof to be removed, and his own mother is said  to have placed the first stone at the doors.  When at the point of  death from starvation, he was carried from the sanctuary before he  polluted it with his corpse.  Such was the end of the victor of  Plataea.  After his death proofs were discovered among his papers that  Themistocles was implicated in his guilt.  But in order to follow the  fortunes of the Athenian statesman, it is necessary to take a glance at  the internal history of Athens.    The ancient rivalry between Themistocles and Aristides had been in a  good degree extinguished by the danger which threatened their common  country during the Persian wars.  Aristides had since abandoned his  former prejudices, and was willing to conform to many of the  democratical innovations of his rival.  The effect of this was to  produce, soon after their return to Attica, a still further  modification of the constitution of Clisthenes. The Thetes the lowest  of the four classes of Athenian citizens, were declared eligible for  the magistracy, from which they had been excluded by the laws of Solon.  Thus not only the archonship, but consequently the Council of  Areopagus, was thrown open to them; and, strange to say, this reform  was "]]]
