But in 1859, when the great entrenched camp at Antwerp was  finally taken in hand, he had already gone over to the school of polygonal  fortification and the ideas of Montalembert. About twenty years later  Brialmont's own types and plans began to stand out amidst the general  confusion of ideas on fortification which naturally resulted from the  introduction of long-range guns, and from the events of 1870-71. The  extreme detached forts of the Antwerp region and the fortifications on the  Meuse at Liege and Namur were constructed in accordance with Brialmont's  final principles, viz. the lavish use of armour to protect the artillery  inside the forts, the suppression of all artillery positions open to  overhead fire, and the multiplication of intermediate batteries (see  FORTIFICATION AND SIEGECRAFT). In his capacity of inspector-general  Brialmont drafted and carried out the whole scheme for the defences of  Belgium. He was an indefatigable writer, and produced, besides essays,  reviews and other papers in the journals, twenty-three important works and  forty-nine pamphlets. In 1850 he originated the _Journal de l'armee Belge_.  His most important publications were _La Fortification du temps present_  (Brussels, 1885); _Influence du tir plongeant et des obus-torpilles sur la  fortification_ (Brussels, 1888); _Les Regions fortifiees_ (Brussels, 1890);  _La Defense des etats et la fortification a la fin du XIX^e siecle_  (Brussels, 1895); _Progres de la defense des etats et de la fortification  permanente depuis Vauban_ (Brussels, 1898).    BRIAN (926-1014), king of Ireland, known as BRIAN BORU, BOROMA, or BOROIMHE  (from _boroma_, an Irish word for tribute), was a son of a certain Kennedy  or Cenneide (d. 951). He passed his youth in fighting against the Danes,  who were constantly ravaging Munster, the northern part of which district  was the home of Brian's tribe, and won much fame in these encounters. In  976 his brother, Mathgamhain or Mahon, who had become king of Thomond about  951 and afterwards king of Munster, was murdered; Brian avenged this deed,  became himself king of Munster in 978, and set out upon his career of  conquest. He forced the tribes of Munster and then those of Leinster to own  his sovereignty, defeated the Danes, who were established around Dublin, in  Wicklow, and marched into Dublin, and after several reverses compelled  Malachy (Maelsechlainn), the chief king of Ireland, who ruled in Meath, to  bow before him in 1002. Connaught was his next objective. Here and also in  Ulster he was successful, everywhere he received hostages and tribute, and  he was generally recognized as the _ardri_, or chief king of Ireland. After  a period of comparative quiet Brian was again at war with the Danes of  Dublin, and on the 23rd of April 1014 his forces gained a great victory  over them at Clontarf. After this battle, however, the old king was slain  in his tent, and was buried at Armagh. Brian has enjoyed a great and not  undeserved reputation. One of his charters is still preserved in Trinity  College, Dublin.    See E.A. D'Alton, _History of Ireland_, vol. i. (1903).    BRIANCON, a strongly fortified town in the department of Hautes-Alpes in  S.E. France. It is built at a height of 4334 ft. on a plateau which  dominates the junction of the Durance with the Guisane. The town itself is  formed of very steep and narrow, though picturesque streets. As it lies at  the foot of the descent from the Mont Genevre Pass, giving access to Turin,  a great number of fortifications have been constructed on the heights  around Briancon, especially towards the east. The Fort Janus is no less  than 4000 ft. above the town. The parish church, with its two towers, was  built 1703-1726, and occupies a very conspicuous position. The Pont  d'Asfeld, E. of the town, was built in 1734, and forms an arch of 131 ft.  span, thrown at a height of 184 ft. across the Durance. The modern town  extends in the plain at the S.W. foot of the plateau on which the old town  is built and forms the suburb of Ste Catherine, with the railway station,  and an important silk-weaving factory. Briancon is 511/2 m. by rail from Gap.  The commune had a civil population in 1906 of 4883 (urban population 3130),  while the permanent garrison was 2641--in all 7524 inhabitants.    Briancon was the _Brigantium_ of the Romans and formed part of the kingdom  of King Cottius. About 1040 it came into the hands of the counts of Albon  (later dauphins of the Viennois) and thenceforth shared the fate of the  Dauphine. The Brianconnais included not merely the upper valley of the  Durance (with those of its affluents, the Gyronde and the Guil), but also  the valley of the Dora Riparia (Cesanne, Oulx, Bardonneche and Exilles),  and that of the Chisone (Fenestrelles, Perouse, Pragelas)--these glens all  lying on the eastern slope of the chain of the Alps. But by the treaty of  Utrecht (1713) all these valleys were handed over to Savoy in exchange for  that of Barcelonnette, on the west slope of the Alps. In 1815 Briancon  successfully withstood a siege of three months at the hands of the Allies,  a feat which is commemorated by an inscription on one of its gates, _Le  passe repond de l'avenir_.    (W. A. B. C.)    BRIAND, ARISTIDE (1862- ), French statesman, was born at Nantes, of a  bourgeois family. He studied law, and while still young took to politics,  associating himself with the most advanced movements, writing articles for  the anarchist journal _Le Peuple_, and directing the _Lanterne_ for some  time. From this he passed to the _Petite Republique_, leaving it to found,  with Jean Jaures, _L'Humanite_. At the same time he was prominent in the  movement for the formation of labour unions, and at the congress of working  men at Nantes in 1894 he secured the adoption of the labour union idea  against the adherents of Jules Guesde. From that time, Briand became one of  the leaders of the French Socialist party. In 1902, after several  unsuccessful attempts, he was elected deputy. He declared himself a strong  partisan of the union of the Left in what is known as the _Bloc_, in order  to check the reactionary deputies of the Right. From the beginning of his  career in the chamber of deputies, Briand was occupied with the question of  the separation of church and state. He was appointed reporter of the  commission charged with the preparation of the law, and his masterly report  at once marked him out as one of the coming leaders. He succeeded in  carrying his project through with but slight modifications, and without  dividing the parties upon whose support he relied. He was the principal  author of the law of separation, but, not content with preparing it, he  wished to apply it as well, especially as the existing Rouvier [v.04  p.0516] ministry allowed disturbances to occur during the taking of  inventories of church property, a clause of the law for which Briand was  not responsible. Consequently he accepted the portfolio of public  instruction and worship in the Sarrien ministry (1906). So far as the  chamber was concerned his success was complete. But the acceptance of a  portfolio in a bourgeois ministry led to his exclusion from the Unified  Socialist party (March 1906). As opposed to Jaures, he contended that the  Socialists should co-operate actively with the Radicals in all matters of  reform, and not stand aloof to await the complete fulfilment of their  ideals.    BRIANZA, a district of Lombardy, Italy, forming the south part of the  province of Como, between the two southern arms of the lake of that name.  It is thickly populated and remarkable for its fertility; and being hilly  is a favourite summer resort of the Milanese.    BRIARE, a town of north-central France in the department of Loiret on the  right bank of the Loire, 451/2 m. S.E. of Orleans on the railway to Nevers.  Pop. (1906) 4613. Briare, the _Brivodorum_ of the Romans, is situated at  the extremity of the Canal of Briare, which unites the Loire and its  lateral canal with the Loing and so with the Seine. The canal of Briare was  constructed from 1605 to 1642 and is about 36 m. long. The industries  include the manufacture of fine pottery, and of so-called porcelain buttons  made of felspar and milk by a special process; its inventor, Bapterosses,  has a bust in the town. The canal traffic is in wood, iron, coal, building  materials, &c. A modern hospital and church, and the hotel de ville  installed in an old moated chateau, are the chief buildings. The lateral  canal of the Loire crosses the Loire near Briare by a fine canal-bridge 720  yds. in length.    BRIAREUS, or AEGAEON, in Greek mythology, one of the three hundred-armed,  fifty-headed Hecatoncheires, brother of Cottus and Gyges (or Gyes).  According to Homer (_Iliad_ i. 403) he was called Aegaeon by men, and  Briareus by the gods. He was the son of Poseidon (or Uranus) and Gaea. The  legends regarding him and his brothers are various and somewhat  contradictory. According to the most widely spread myth, Briareus and his  brothers were called by Zeus to his assistance when the Titans were making  war upon Olympus. The gigantic enemies were defeated and consigned to  Tartarus, at the gates of which the three brothers were placed (Hesiod,  _Theog._ 624, 639, 714). Other accounts make Briareus one of the assailants  of Olympus, who, after his defeat, was buried under Mount Aetna  (Callimachus, _Hymn to Delos_, 141). Homer mentions him as assisting Zeus  when the other Olympian deities were plotting against the king of gods and  men (_Iliad_ i. 398). Another tradition makes him a giant of the sea, ruler  of the fabulous Aegaea in Euboea, an enemy of Poseidon and the inventor of  warships (Schol. on Apoll. Rhod. i. 1165). It would be difficult to  determine exactly what natural phenomena are symbolized by the  Hecatoncheires.

This infernal wind, coming right through the native town, is  loaded with infection.\"    \"Has it affected her, then?\" asked Sime anxiously.    \"She nearly fainted in the ball-room,\" replied the Colonel. \"Her  mother took her home half an hour ago. I looked for you everywhere,  but couldn't find you.\"    \"Quite a number have succumbed,\" said Sime.    \"Eileen seemed to be slightly hysterical,\" continued the Colonel. \"She  persisted that someone wearing a crocodile mask had been standing  beside her at the moment that she was taken ill.\"    Sime started; perhaps Cairn's story was not a matter of imagination  after all.    \"There is someone here, dressed like that, I believe,\" he replied,  with affected carelessness. \"He seems to have frightened several  people. Any idea who he is?\"    \"My dear chap!\" cried the Colonel, \"I have been searching the place  for him! But I have never once set eyes upon him. I was about to ask  if _you_ knew anything about it!\"    Sime returned to the table where Cairn was sitting. The latter seemed  to have recovered somewhat; but he looked far from well. Sime stared  at him critically.    \"I should turn in,\" he said, \"if I were you. _Khamsin_ is playing the  deuce with people. I only hope it does not justify its name and blow  for fifty days.\"    \"Have you seen the man in the mask!\" asked Cairn.    \"No,\" replied Sime, \"but he's here alright; others have seen him.\"    Cairn stood up rather unsteadily, and with Sime made his way through  the moving crowd to the stairs. The band was still playing, but the  cloud of gloom which had settled upon the place, refused to be  dissipated.    \"Good-night, Cairn,\" said Sime, \"see you in the morning.\"    Robert Cairn, with aching head and a growing sensation of nausea,  paused on the landing, looking down into the court below. He could not  disguise from himself that he felt ill, not nervously ill as in  London, but physically sick. This superheated air was difficult to  breathe; it seemed to rise in waves from below.    Then, from a weary glancing at the figures beneath him, his attitude  changed to one of tense watching.    A man, wearing the crocodile mask of Set, stood by a huge urn  containing a palm, looking up to the landing!    Cairn's weakness left him, and in its place came an indescribable  anger, a longing to drive his fist into that grinning mask. He turned  and ran lightly down the stairs, conscious of a sudden glow of energy.  Reaching the floor, he saw the mask making across the hall, in the  direction of the outer door. As rapidly as possible, for he could not  run, without attracting undesirable attention, Cairn followed. The  figure of Set passed out on to the terrace, but when Cairn in turn  swung open the door, his quarry had vanished.    Then, in an _arabiyeh_ just driving off, he detected the hideous mask.  Hatless as he was, he ran down the steps and threw himself into  another. The carriage-controller was in attendance, and Cairn rapidly  told him to instruct the driver to follow the _arabiyeh_ which had  just left. The man lashed up his horses, turned the carriage, and went  galloping on after the retreating figure. Past the Esbekiya Gardens  they went, through several narrow streets, and on to the quarter of  the Muski. Time after time he thought he had lost the carriage ahead,  but his own driver's knowledge of the tortuous streets enabled him  always to overtake it again. They went rocking along lanes so narrow  that with outstretched arms one could almost have touched the walls on  either side; past empty shops and unlighted houses. Cairn had not the  remotest idea of his whereabouts, save that he was evidently in the  district of the bazaars. A right-angled corner was abruptly  negotiated--and there, ahead of him, stood the pursued vehicle! The  driver was turning his horses around, to return; his fare was  disappearing from sight into the black shadows of a narrow alley on  the left.    Cairn leaped from the _arabiyeh_, shouting to the man to wait, and  went dashing down the sloping lane after the retreating figure. A sort  of blind fury possessed him, but he never paused to analyse it, never  asked himself by what right he pursued this man, what wrong the latter  had done him. His action was wholly unreasoning; he knew that he  wished to overtake the wearer of the mask and to tear it from his  head; upon that he acted!    He discovered that despite the tropical heat of the night, he was  shuddering with cold, but he disregarded this circumstance, and ran  on.    The pursued stopped before an iron-studded door, which was opened  instantly; he entered as the runner came up with him. And, before the  door could be reclosed, Cairn thrust his way in.    Blackness, utter blackness, was before him. The figure which he had  pursued seemed to have been swallowed up. He stumbled on, gropingly,  hands outstretched, then fell--fell, as he realised in the moment of  falling, down a short flight of stone steps.    Still amid utter blackness, he got upon his feet, shaken but otherwise  unhurt by his fall. He turned about, expecting to see some glimmer of  light from the stairway, but the blackness was unbroken. Silence and  gloom hemmed him in. He stood for a moment, listening intently.    A shaft of light pierced the darkness, as a shutter was thrown open.  Through an iron-barred window the light shone; and with the light came  a breath of stifling perfume. That perfume carried his imagination  back instantly to a room at Oxford, and he advanced and looked through  into the place beyond. He drew a swift breath, clutched the bars, and  was silent--stricken speechless.    He looked into a large and lofty room, lighted by several hanging  lamps. It had a carpeted divan at one end and was otherwise scantily  furnished, in the Eastern manner. A silver incense-burner smoked upon  a large praying-carpet, and by it stood the man in the crocodile mask.  An Arab girl, fantastically attired, who had evidently just opened the  shutters, was now helping him to remove the hideous head-dress.    She presently untied the last of the fastenings and lifted the thing  from the man's shoulders, moving away with the gliding step of the  Oriental, and leaving him standing there in his short white tunic,  bare-legged and sandalled.    The smoke of the incense curled upward and played around the straight,  slim figure, drew vaporous lines about the still, ivory face--the  handsome, sinister face, sometimes partly veiling the long black eyes  and sometimes showing them in all their unnatural brightness. So the  man stood, looking towards the barred window.    It was Antony Ferrara!    \"Ah, dear Cairn--\" the husky musical voice smote upon Cairn's ears as  the most hated sound in nature--\"you have followed me. Not content  with driving me from London, you would also render Cairo--my dear  Cairo--untenable for me.\"    Cairn clutched the bars but was silent.    \"How wrong of you, Cairn!\" the soft voice mocked. \"This attention is  so harmful--to you. Do you know, Cairn, the Sudanese formed the  extraordinary opinion that I was an _efreet_, and this strange  reputation has followed me right down the Nile. Your father, my dear  friend, has studied these odd matters, and he would tell you that  there is no power, in Nature, higher than the human will. Actually,  Cairn, they have ascribed to me the direction of the _Khamsin_, and so  many worthy Egyptians have made up their minds that I travel with the  storm--or that the storm follows me--that something of the kind has  really come to pass! Or is it merely coincidence, Cairn? Who can say?\"    Motionless, immobile, save for a slow smile, Antony Ferrara stood, and  Cairn kept his eyes upon the evil face, and with trembling hands  clutched the bars.    \"It is certainly odd, is it not,\" resumed the taunting voice, \"that  _Khamsin_, so violent, too, should thus descend upon the Cairene  season? I only arrived from the Fayum this evening, Cairn, and, do you  know, they have the pestilence there! I trust the hot wind does not  carry it to Cairo; there are so many distinguished European and  American visitors here. It would be a thousand pities!\"    Cairn released his grip of the bars, raised his clenched fists above  his head, and in a voice and with a maniacal fury that were neither  his own, cursed the man who stood there mocking him. Then he reeled,  fell, and remembered no more.           *       *       *       *       *    \"All right, old man--you'll do quite nicely now.\"    It was Sime speaking.    Cairn struggled upright ... and found himself in bed! Sime was seated  beside him.    \"Don't talk!\" said Sime, \"you're in hospital! I'll do the talking; you  listen. I saw you bolt out of Shepheard's last night--shut up! I  followed, but lost you. We got up a search party, and with the aid of  the man who had driven you, ran you to earth in a dirty alley behind  the mosque of El-Azhar. Four kindly mendicants, who reside upon the  steps of the establishment, had been awakened by your blundering in  among them. They were holding you--yes, you were raving pretty badly.  You are a lucky man, Cairn. You were inoculated before you left home?\"    Cairn nodded weakly.    \"Saved you. Be all right in a couple of days. That damned _Khamsin_  has brought a whiff of the plague from somewhere! Curiously enough,  over fifty per cent. of the cases spotted so far are people who were  at the carnival! Some of them, Cairn--but we won't discuss that now. I  was afraid of it, last night. That's why I kept my eye on you. My boy,  you were delirious when you bolted out of the hotel!\"    \"Was I?\" said Cairn wearily, and lay back on the pillow. \"Perhaps I  was.\"          CHAPTER XIV    DR.
