When the storm is coming and you are  afraid and fly before it, no one shall think of you. All men shall close  their doors against you and fasten them.\" Then to her little daughter  she said, \"My little moon, you were unselfish and thoughtful. You shall  always be bright and beautiful, and men shall love you and praise you  whenever they look upon your gentle, kindly face.\"    This is why men hide from the sun and the wind, but never from the moon.          WHY THERE IS A HARE IN THE MOON.      Many strange things happened long ago, and one of them was that a hare,  a monkey, and a fox agreed to live together. They talked about their  plan a long time. Then the hare said, \"I promise to help the monkey and  the fox.\" The monkey declared, \"I promise to help the fox and the hare.\"  The fox said, \"I promise to help the hare and the monkey.\" They shook  hands, or rather shook paws. There was something else to which they  agreed, and that was that they would kill no living creature.    The manito was much pleased when he heard of this plan, but he said to  himself, \"I should like to make sure that what I have heard is true, and  that they are really gentle and kind to others as well as to themselves.  I will go to the forest and see how they behave toward strangers.\"    The manito appeared before the three animals, but they thought he was a  hunter. \"May I come into your lodge and rest?\" he asked. \"I am very  weary.\"    All three came toward him and gave him a welcome. \"Come into our lodge,\"  they said. \"We have agreed to help one another, so we will help one  another to help you.\"    \"I have been hungry all day,\" said the manito, \"but I should rather have  such a welcome than food.\"    \"But if you are hungry, you must have food,\" declared the three animals.  \"If there were anything in our lodge that you would care to eat, you  might have part of it or all of it, but there is nothing here that you  would like.\"    Then said the monkey, \"I have a plan. I will go out into the forest and  find you some food.\"    When the monkey came back, he said, \"I found a tree with some fruit on  it. I climbed it and shook it, and here is the fruit. There was only a  little of it, for fruit was scarce.\"    \"Will you not eat part of it yourself?\" asked the manito.    \"No,\" answered the monkey. \"I had rather see you eat it, for I think you  are more hungry than I.\"    The manito wished to know whether the fox and the hare would behave as  unselfishly toward him, and he said, \"My good friends, the fruit was  indeed welcome, but I am still hungry.\"    Then the fox said, \"I will go out into the forest and see what I can  find for you.\"    When the fox came back, he said, \"I shook the trees, but no more fruit  fell. I could not climb the trees, for my paws are not made for  climbing, but I searched on the ground, and at last I found some hominy  that a traveler had left, and I have brought you that.\"    The manito had soon eaten the hominy. He wished to know whether the hare  would behave as kindly as the others, and before long he said, \"My good  friends, the hominy was indeed welcome, but I am still hungry.\"    Then the hare said, \"I will gladly go out into the forest and search for  food.\" He was gone a long time, but when he came back, he brought no  food.    \"I am very hungry,\" said the manito.    \"Stranger,\" said the hare, \"if you will build a fire beside the rock, I  can give you some food.\"    The manito built a fire, and the hare said, \"Now I will spring from the  top of the rock upon the fire. I have heard that men eat flesh, that is  taken from the fire, and I will give you my own.\"    The hare sprang from the rock, but the manito caught him in his hands  before the flame could touch him, and said, \"Dear, unselfish little  hare, the monkey and the fox have welcomed me and searched the forest  through to find me food, but you have done more, for you have given me  yourself. I will take the gift, little hare, and I will carry you in my  arms up to the moon, so that every one on the earth may see you and hear  the tale of your kindness and unselfishness.\"    [Illustration]    The Indians can see a hare in the moon, and this is the story that they  tell their children about it.          THE CHILDREN IN THE MOON.      They had no idea where they came from. All they knew was that they lived  on the hill, and that the old man of the hill called them Jack and Jill.  They had plenty of berries to eat, and when night came, they had soft  beds of fir to sleep on. There were all kinds of animals on the hill,  and they were friendly to the two children. They could have had a most  delightful time playing all day long if it had not been for having to  carry water.    Every morning, just as soon as the first rays of the sun could be seen  from their home, they heard the voice of the old man of the hill  calling, \"Jack! Jill! Take your pail and get some water.\" Whenever they  were having an especially pleasant game with some of the animals, they  heard the same call, \"Take your pail and get some water.\" It is no  wonder that Jack awoke one night when no one called and said, \"Jill, did  he say we must get some water?\" \"I suppose so,\" answered Jill sleepily,  and they went out with the pail.    The moon was shining down through the trees, and they imagined that she  was nearer than ever before. The forest was not half so lonely with her  gentle face looking down upon them. Soon they felt happier than at  first, and they played little games together, running from tree to tree.    \"We have spilled half the water,\" said Jill.    \"There's plenty left,\" said Jack, \"if half _is_ spilled.\"    \"Do you suppose there are any children who play games whenever they like  and do not have to carry water?\"    \"Plenty of them,\" declared Jack.        \"Jack and Jill      Went up the hill      To get a pail of water,\"    sang a voice so clear that it seemed close at hand, and so soft that it  seemed far away.    Jack started, fell, and rolled down the hillside, and Jill came tumbling  after. As for the water, what was left was spilled before Jack had  rolled over once; and before he had rolled over twice, the same voice  sang,--        \"Jack fell down      And broke his crown,      And Jill came tumbling after.\"    \"It is about us,\" cried Jill.    \"I have not broken any crown,\" said Jack.    \"It is the crown of your head,\" declared Jill.    \"Oh!\" said Jack; \"but where's the water?\"    \"It has gone tumbling down the hill,\" answered the same voice.    \"How can water go tumbling?\" cried Jill. \"_We_ tumbled.\"    \"Water tumbles too,\" replied the voice, \"especially when it is frozen.\"    \"Oh!\" said Jack.    \"Oh!\" said Jill.    \"The stream is frozen,\" called the voice.    \"What stream?\" asked the children together.    \"The stream that goes down the hill,\" answered the voice. \"Did you not  know that you were bringing water to keep the stream full?\"    \"No, indeed,\" said the children.    \"The old man of the hill is only a rock, and what you thought his voice  was only the water flowing around it.\"    [Illustration]    \"Oh!\" cried Jack.    \"Oh!\" cried Jill.    \"The stream is frozen,\" said the voice, \"and the earth has a cloak of  snow and ice.\"    \"Who are you?\" asked Jill shyly.    \"Do you really not know? What a strange child you are! I am the moon, of  course. Very pleasant people live with me, and I have come to invite you  both to go home with me. Will you come?\"    The children looked up through the trees, and there was the gentle face  of the moon, looking more gentle and kind than ever. \"Come,\" said she,  and they went very willingly. They have lived in the moon many years,  but they never again carried a pail of water for a stream. \"That is the  work of the clouds and the sun,\" says the moon.          WHY THERE IS A MAN IN THE MOON.      \"Goodman,\" said the goodwife, \"you must go out into the forest and  gather sticks for the fire. To-morrow will be Sunday, and we have no  wood to burn.\"    \"Yes, goodwife,\" answered the goodman, \"I will go to the forest.\"    He did go to the forest, but he sat on a mossy rock and fished till it  was dark, and so he brought home no wood. \"The goodwife shall not know  it,\" he thought. \"I will go to the forest to-morrow morning and gather  sticks.\"    When morning came, he crept softly out of the house when it was hardly  light, and went to the forest. Soon he had as many sticks as he could  carry, and he was starting for home when a voice called sternly, \"Put  those sticks down.\" He looked to the right, to the left, before him,  behind him, and over his head. There was no one to be seen.    \"Put those sticks down,\" said the voice again.    \"Please, I do not dare to put them down,\" replied the goodman, trembling  with fear. \"They are to burn, and my wife cannot cook the dinner without  them.\"    \"You will have no dinner to-day,\" said the voice.    \"The goodwife will not know that I did not gather them last night, and  she will let me have some dinner. I am almost sure she will,\" the  goodman replied.    \"You must not gather sticks to-day,\" said the voice more sternly than  ever. \"It is Sunday. Put them down.\"    \"Indeed, Mr. Voice, I dare not,\" whispered the goodman; and afar off he  thought he heard his wife calling, \"Goodman, where are you? There is no  wood to burn.\"    \"Will you put them down, or will you carry them forever?\" cried the  voice angrily.    \"Truly, I cannot put them down, for I dare not go home without them,\"  answered the goodman, shaking with fear from head to foot. \"The goodwife  would not like it.\"    \"Then carry them forever,\" said the voice. \"You care not for Sunday, and  you shall never have another Sunday.\"    The goodman could not tell how it came "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22430"],[0,"Evolution in Modern Thought (#17)"],[1,"significance  for the theory, have been the subject of numerous and careful  investigations, and at least their essential features are now fully  established. Mueller took for granted, without making any  investigations, that young birds only learn by experience to  distinguish between different kinds of victims. But Lloyd Morgan's[52]  experiments with young birds proved that this is really the case, and  at the same time furnished an additional argument against the  _Lamarckian principle_.    In addition to the mimicry-rings first observed in South America,  others have been described from Tropical India by Moore, and by  Poulton and Dixey from Africa, and we may expect to learn many more  interesting facts in this connection. Here again the preliminary  postulates of the theory are satisfied. And how much more that would  lead to the same conclusion might be added!    As in the case of mimicry many species have come to resemble one  another through processes of selection, so we know whole classes of  phenomena in which plants and animals have become adapted to one  another, and have thus been modified to a considerable degree. I refer  particularly to the relation between flowers and insects. Darwin has  shown that the originally inconspicuous blossoms of the phanerogams  were transformed into flowers through the visits of insects, and that,  conversely, several large orders of insects have been gradually  modified by their association with flowers, especially as regards the  parts of their body actively concerned. Bees and butterflies in  particular have become what they are through their relation to  flowers. In this case again all that is apparently contradictory to  the theory can, on closer investigation, be beautifully interpreted in  corroboration of it. Selection can give rise only to what is of use to  the organism actually concerned, never to what is of use to some other  organism, and we must therefore expect to find that in flowers only  characters of use to _themselves_ have arisen, never characters which  are of use to insects only, and conversely that in the insects  characters useful to them and not merely to the plants would have  originated. For a long time it seemed as if an exception to this rule  existed in the case of the fertilisation of the yucca blossoms by a  little moth, _Pronuba yuccasella_. This little moth has a  sickle-shaped appendage to its mouth-parts which occurs hi no other  Lepidopteron, and which is used for pushing the yellow pollen into the  opening of the pistil, thus fertilising the flower. Thus it appears as  if a new structure, which is useful only to the plant, has arisen in  the insect. But the difficulty is solved as soon as we learn that the  moth lays its eggs in the fruit-buds of the Yucca, and that the  larvae, when they emerge, feed on the developing seeds. In effecting  the fertilisation of the flower the moth is at the same time making  provision for its own offspring, since it is only after fertilisation  that the seeds begin to develop. There is thus nothing to prevent our  referring this structural adaptation in _Pronuba yuccasella_ to  processes of selection, which have gradually transformed the maxillary  palps of the female into the sickle-shaped instrument for collecting  the pollen, and which have at the same time developed in the insect  the instinct to press the pollen into the pistil.    In this domain, then, the theory of selection finds nothing but  corroboration, and it would be impossible to substitute for it any  other explanation, which now that the facts are so well known, could  be regarded as a serious rival to it. That selection is a factor, and  a very powerful factor in the evolution of organisms, can no longer be  doubted. Even although we cannot bring forward formal proofs of it _in  detail_, cannot calculate definitely the size of the variations which  present themselves, and their selection-value, cannot, in short,  reduce the whole process to a mathematical formula, yet we must assume  selection, because it is the only possible explanation applicable to  whole classes of phenomena, and because, on the other hand, it is made  up of factors which we know can be proved actually to exist, and  which, _if_ they exist, must of logical necessity cooeperate in the  manner required by the theory. _We must accept it because the  phenomena of evolution and adaptation must have a natural basis, and  because it is the only possible explanation of them._[53]    Many people are willing to admit that selection explains adaptations,  but they maintain that only a part of the phenomena are thus  explained, because everything does not depend upon adaptation. They  regard adaptation as, so to speak, a special effort on the part of  Nature, which she keeps in readiness to meet particularly difficult  claims of the external world on organisms. But if we look at the  matter more carefully we shall find that adaptations are by no means  exceptional, but that they are present everywhere in such enormous  numbers, that it would be difficult in regard to any structure  whatever, to prove that adaptation had _not_ played a part in its  evolution.    How often has the senseless objection been urged against selection  that it can create nothing, it can only reject. It is true that it  cannot create either the living substance or the variations of it;  both must be given. But in rejecting one thing it preserves another,  intensifies it, combines it, and in this way _creates_ what is new.  _Everything_ in organisms depends on adaptation; that is to say,  everything must be admitted through the narrow door of selection,  otherwise it can take no part in the building up of the whole. But, it  is asked, what of the direct effect of external conditions,  temperature, nutrition, climate and the like? Undoubtedly these can  give rise to variations, but they too must pass through the door of  selection, and if they cannot do this they are rejected, eliminated  from the constitution of the species.    It may, perhaps, be objected that such external influences are often  of a compelling power, and that every animal must submit to them, and  that thus selection has no choice and can neither select nor reject.  There may be such cases; let us assume for instance that the effect  of the cold of the Arctic regions was to make all the mammals become  black; the result would be that they would all be eliminated by  selection, and that no mammals would be able to live there at all. But  in most cases a certain percentage of animals resists these strong  influences, and thus selection secures a foothold on which to work,  eliminating the unfavourable variation, and establishing a useful  colouring, consistent with what is required for the maintenance of the  species.    Everything depends upon adaptation! We have spoken much of adaptation  in colouring, in connection with the examples brought into prominence  by Darwin, because these are conspicuous, easily verified, and at the  same time convincing for the theory of selection. But is it only  desert and polar animals whose colouring is determined through  adaptation? Or the leaf-butterflies, and the mimetic species, or the  terrifying markings, and \"warning-colours\" and a thousand other kinds  of sympathetic colouring? It is, indeed, never the colouring alone  which makes up the adaptation; the structure of the animal plays a  part, often a very essential part, in the protective disguise, and  thus _many_ variations may cooperate towards _one_ common end. And it  is to be noted that it is by no means only external parts that are  changed; internal parts are _always_ modified at the same time--for  instance, the delicate elements of the nervous system on which depend  the _instinct_ of the insect to hold its wings, when at rest, in a  perfectly definite position, which, in the leaf-butterfly, has the  effect of bringing the two pieces on which the marking occurs on the  anterior and posterior wing into the same direction, and thus  displaying as a whole the fine curve of the midrib on the seeming  leaf. But the wing-holding instinct is not regulated in the same way  in all leaf-butterflies; even our indigenous species of Vanessa, with  their protective ground-colouring, have quite a distinctive way of  holding their wings so that the greater part of the anterior wing is  covered by the posterior when the butterfly is at rest. But the  protective colouring appears on the posterior wing and on the tip of  the anterior, _to precisely the distance to which it is left  uncovered_. This occurs, as Standfuss has shown, in different degrees  in our two most nearly allied species, the uncovered portion being  smaller in _V. urticae_ than in _V. polychloros_. In this case, as in  most leaf-butterflies, the holding of the wing was probably the  primary character; only after that was thoroughly established did the  protective marking develop. In any case, the instinctive manner of  holding the wings is associated with the protective colouring, and  must remain as it is if the latter is to be effective. How greatly  instincts may change, that is to say, may be adapted, is shown by the  case of the Noctuid \"shark\" moth, _Xylina vetusta_. This form bears a  most deceptive resemblance to a piece of rotten wood, and the  appearance is greatly increased by the modification of the innate  impulse to flight common to so many animals, which has here been  transformed into an almost contrary instinct. This moth does not fly  away from danger, but \"feigns death,\" that is, it draws antennae, legs  and wings close to the body, and remains perfectly motionless. It may  be touched, picked up, and thrown down again, and still it does not  move. This remarkable instinct must surely have developed  simultaneously with the wood-colouring; at all events, both  cooeperating variations are now present, and prove that both the  external and the most"]]]
