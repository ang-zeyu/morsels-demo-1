But no! he lay  quite still; he was fled away far beyond earshot of these blows and  shoutings; he was sunk beneath seas of silence; and his name, which  would once have caught his notice above the howling of a storm, had  become an empty sound. And presently the jovial gentleman desisted from  his knocking and departed.    Here was a broad hint to hurry what remained to be done, to get forth  from this accusing neighbourhood, to plunge into a bath of London  multitudes, and to reach, on the other side of day, that haven of safety  and apparent innocence--his bed. One visitor had come; at any moment  another might follow and be more obstinate. To have done the deed,  and yet not to reap the profit, would be too abhorrent a failure. The  money--that was now Markheim's concern; and as a means to that, the  keys.    He glanced over his shoulder at the open door, where the shadow was  still lingering and shivering; and with no conscious repugnance of  the mind, yet with a tremor of the belly, he drew near the body of his  victim. The human character had quite departed. Like a suit half-stuffed  with bran, the limbs lay scattered, the trunk doubled, on the floor; and  yet the thing repelled him. Although so dingy and inconsiderable to the  eye, he feared it might have more significance to the touch. He took the  body by the shoulders, and turned it on its back. It was strangely light  and supple, and the limbs, as if they had been broken, fell into the  oddest postures. The face was robbed of all expression; but it was as  pale as wax, and shockingly smeared with blood about one temple. That  was, for Markheim, the one displeasing circumstance. It carried him  back, upon the instant, to a certain fair-day in a fishers' village: a  gray day, a piping wind, a crowd upon the street, the blare of brasses,  the booming of drums, the nasal voice of a ballad singer; and a boy  going to and fro, buried overhead in the crowd and divided between  interest and fear, until, coming out upon the chief place of concourse,  he beheld a booth and a great screen with pictures, dismally designed,  garishly coloured--Brownrigg with her apprentice, the Mannings with  their murdered guest, Weare in the death-grip of Thurtell, and a score  besides of famous crimes. The thing was as clear as an illusion He was  once again that little boy; he was looking once again, and with the same  sense of physical revolt, at these vile pictures; he was still stunned  by the thumping of the drums. A bar of that day's music returned upon  his memory; and at that, for the first time, a qualm came over him,  a breath of nausea, a sudden weakness of the joints, which he must  instantly resist and conquer.    He judged it more prudent to confront than to flee from these  considerations, looking the more hardily in the dead face, bending his  mind to realise the nature and greatness of his crime. So little a while  ago that face had moved with every change of sentiment, that pale mouth  had spoken, that body had been all on fire with governable energies;  and now, and by his act, that piece of life had been arrested, as the  horologist, with interjected finger, arrests the beating of the  clock. So he reasoned in vain; he could rise to no more remorseful  consciousness; the same heart which had shuddered before the painted  effigies of crime, looked on its reality unmoved. At best, he felt  a gleam of pity for one who had been endowed in vain with all those  faculties that can make the world a garden of enchantment, one who had  never lived and who was now dead. But of penitence, no, not a tremor.    With that, shaking himself clear of these considerations, he found the  keys and advanced toward the open door of the shop. Outside, it had  begun to rain smartly, and the sound of the shower upon the roof had  banished silence. Like some dripping cavern, the chambers of the house  were haunted by an incessant echoing, which filled the ear and mingled  with the ticking of the clocks. And, as Markheim approached the door,  he seemed to hear, in answer to his own cautious tread, the steps of  another foot withdrawing up the stair. The shadow still palpitated  loosely on the threshold. He threw a ton's weight of resolve upon his  muscles, and drew back the door.    The faint, foggy daylight glimmered dimly on the bare floor and stairs;  on the bright suit of armour posted, halbert in hand, upon the landing;  and on the dark wood-carvings, and framed pictures that hung against  the yellow panels of the wainscot. So loud was the beating of the  rain through all the house that, in Markheim's ears, it began to be  distinguished into many different sounds. Footsteps and sighs, the  tread of regiments marching in the distance, the chink of money in the  counting, and the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar, appeared to  mingle with the patter of the drops upon the cupola and the gushing of  the water in the pipes. The sense that he was not alone grew upon him  to the verge of madness. On every side he was haunted and begirt by  presences. He heard them moving in the upper chambers; from the shop,  he heard the dead man getting to his legs; and as he began with a great  effort to mount the stairs, feet fled quietly before him and followed  stealthily behind. If he were but deaf, he thought, how tranquilly he  would possess his soul! And then again, and hearkening with ever fresh  attention, he blessed himself for that unresting sense which held the  outposts and stood a trusty sentinel upon his life. His head turned  continually on his neck; his eyes, which seemed starting from their  orbits, scouted on every side, and on every side were half rewarded as  with the tail of something nameless vanishing. The four and twenty steps  to the first floor were four and twenty agonies.    On that first story, the doors stood ajar--three of them, like three  ambushes, shaking his nerves like the throats of cannon. He could  never again, he felt, be sufficiently immured and fortified from men's  observing eyes; he longed to be home, girt in by walls, buried among  bedclothes, and invisible to all but God. And at that thought he  wondered a little, recollecting tales of other murderers and the fear  they were said to entertain of heavenly avengers. It was not so, at  least, with him. He feared the laws of nature, lest, in their callous  and immutable procedure, they should preserve some damning evidence of  his crime. He feared tenfold more, with a slavish, superstitious  terror, some scission in the continuity of man's experience, some wilful  illegality of nature. He played a game of skill, depending on the rules,  calculating consequence from cause; and what if nature, as the defeated  tyrant overthrew the chess-board, should break the mould of their  succession? The like had befallen Napoleon (so writers said) when  the winter changed the time of its appearance. The like might befall  Markheim: the solid walls might become transparent and reveal his doings  like those of bees in a glass hive; the stout planks might yield under  his foot like quicksands and detain him in their clutch. Ay, and there  were soberer accidents that might destroy him; if, for instance, the  house should fall and imprison him beside the body of his victim, or the  house next door should fly on fire, and the firemen invade him from all  sides. These things he feared; and, in a sense, these things might be  called the hands of God reached forth against sin. But about God himself  he was at ease; his act was doubtless exceptional, but so were his  excuses, which God knew; it was there, and not among men, that he felt  sure of justice.    When he had got safe into the drawing-room, and shut the door behind  him, he was aware of a respite from alarms. The room was quite  dismantled, uncarpeted besides, and strewn with packing-cases and  incongruous furniture; several great pier-glasses, in which he beheld  himself at various angles, like an actor on a stage; many pictures,  framed and unframed, standing, with their faces to the wall; a fine  Sheraton sideboard, a cabinet of marquetry, and a great old bed, with  tapestry hangings. The windows opened to the floor; but by great  good fortune the lower part of the shutters had been closed, and this  concealed him from the neighbours. Here, then, Markheim drew in a  packing-case before the cabinet, and began to search among the keys. It  was a long business, for there were many; and it was irksome, besides;  for, after all, there might be nothing in the cabinet, and time was on  the wing. But the closeness of the occupation sobered him. With the  tail of his eye he saw the door--even glanced at it from time to time  directly, like a besieged commander pleased to verify the good estate  of his defences. But in truth he was at peace. The rain falling in the  street sounded natural and pleasant. Presently, on the other side, the  notes of a piano were wakened to the music of a hymn, and the voices of  many children took up the air and words. How stately, how comfortable  was the melody! How fresh the youthful voices! Markheim gave ear to it  smilingly, as he sorted out the keys; and his mind was thronged with  answerable ideas and images: church-going children, and the pealing of  the high organ; children afield, bathers by the brookside, ramblers on  the brambly common, kite-flyers in the windy and cloud-navigated sky;  and then, at another cadence of the hymn, back again to church, and the  somnolence of summer Sundays, and the high genteel voice of the parson  (which he smiled a little to recall) and the painted Jacobean tombs, and  the dim lettering of the Ten Commandments in the chancel.    And as he sat thus, at once busy and absent, he was startled to his  feet. A flash of ice, a flash of fire, a bursting gush of blood, went  over him, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20729"],[0,"At the Point of the Bayonet: A Tale of the Mahratta War (#17)"],[1,"to  carry out the plan without any assistance from yourself, and it is  most important that nothing shall be done that can arouse the  suspicions of Balloba, until all is ready for the final stroke. I  have not brought it with me, today, as I knew not how vigilant they  might be in camp, and it was possible that my sacks of grain might  be examined. As, however, I passed in without question, I will  bring it when I next come, which will be in two days.\"    \"I suppose there is no objection to my telling Phurkay what is  being done?\"    \"None at all, Your Highness. He has not yet been informed, though  communications have passed between him and Nana. But, although the  latter was well convinced of his devotion, he thought it safer that  no one should know the extent of the plot, until all was in  readiness.\"    Two days later, Harry made another journey to the camp, and this  time with the bags of money hidden among the grain, in one of the  sacks. He saw Bajee Rao, as before, and received from him a paper,  with the undertaking required by Nana. The sack containing the  money was put down where Bajee's horses were picketed, and was  there opened by a confidential servant, who carried the bags into  the tent which was close by.    As he was leaving the camp, Harry had reason to congratulate  himself on the precautions that he had taken; for he met Balloba,  riding along with a number of officers. Harry had, with his change  of costume, assumed the appearance of age. He walked by the side of  the bullocks, stooping greatly and leaning on his staff; and the  minister passed without even glancing at him.    Harry, on his return, paid the farmer for the hire of his cart. The  latter was well pleased for, in addition to the money so earned, he  had charged a good price for the two waggon loads of grain. Harry  then put off the peasant's dress, and resumed that of a trooper,  and rode back to Raygurh, where he reported to Nana the success of  his mission.        Chapter 5: Down To Bombay.      Harry's stay with Nana was a short one as, in three days, he was  again sent to Poona. This time he was to take up his abode at a  large house, occupied by two of the leaders of Bajee's party; the  rajah having told him that he would request them to entertain him,  if he should again come to Poona. He was the bearer of fifty  thousand rupees, principally in gold, which he was to give to them  for the use of Bajee. He had no message this time for the prince,  personally, Nana having said to him:    \"I want you to let me know how matters are going on. The young man  may do something rash and, if Balloba's suspicions are in any way  excited, he may send him to some distant fortress; which would  seriously upset my plans, for I should have to retain Chimnajee in  power, as representative of his brother.    \"We know that he was placed on the musnud greatly in opposition to  his wishes; and he certainly hailed, with pleasure, the prospect of  Bajee's release. Still, it would not be the same thing for me. A  minister of the Peishwa can rule without question by the people  but, acting only as minister to a representative of the Peishwa, he  would be far more severely criticised; and it is certain that, to  raise money for paying Scindia the sum that has been agreed upon,  extra taxation must be put on, the odium resulting from which would  fall upon me.\"    The two officers received Harry cordially. He had personally known  them both and, as Nana's representative, they would have treated  him with much honour, had it not been pointed out to them that this  might be fatal to their plans for, did Balloba hear that some  strange officer was being so treated by them, he would be sure to  set at once about finding out who he was, and what he was doing  there.    \"Matters are going on well,\" they said. \"The old general, Manajee  Phurkay, who was one of Rugoba's devoted adherents, is now staying  in Bajee's camp, and is enlisting men for his service.\"    \"Where are they being assembled?\"    \"In Bajee's camp. He is not interfered with, there.\"    \"It appears to be a very rash proceeding,\" Harry said. \"It is true  that Bajee has apparent liberty, and can have with him in his camp  many of his friends; but a gathering of armed men can scarcely  escape the eye of so keen an observer as Balloba.\"    [Illustration: Harry . . . saw a party of soldiers coming along the]  road.    A few days later, Harry, being out one evening, saw a party of  soldiers coming along the road from the direction of Scindia's  camp. This was unusual for, in order to prevent plundering, the  orders were stringent that none of Scindia's troops should enter  Poona. He hurried back to the house, and acquainted the two leaders  with what he had seen. They were inclined to laugh at his  apprehension but, when a body of horsemen were seen coming down the  street, they issued orders for the doors to be closed and  barricaded. There were some twenty men in the house, and when the  officer who commanded the detachment summoned them to open the  door, and to deliver the two nobles to him, he was met by a decided  refusal, from the chiefs themselves, from an upper window.    The officer then ordered his men to dismount and break open the  door but, when they attempted to do so, they were met by a fire of  musketry from every window. Many fell; and the officer, seeing that  the house could not be taken, except by a force much larger than  that at his command, rode off at full speed, with the survivors, to  Scindia's camp.    No sooner had they gone than the horses were brought out from the  stables, and the two officers, with ten of their troopers, rode off  at full speed. Harry refused to accompany them, as he wished to see  what had really happened, in order to carry the news to Nana. He  therefore rode out to the farmhouse where he had before stayed,  left his horse there, and returned to Poona.    Here he heard that Rao Phurkay had been seized, and that Bajee  Rao's encampment was surrounded by troops, who suffered none to  enter or leave it. The next morning he went over there and found  that, as the supply of water had been cut off, the garrison had  surrendered; all being allowed to depart, with the exception of  Bajee, over whom a strong guard had been placed.    Before they left, Manajee Phurkay gave them all directions to  gather in the neighbourhood of Waee. They did so, and were joined  at once by the two chiefs. Nana promptly sent them a supply of  money, telling them to take up their position at the Salpee Ghaut;  where they were speedily joined by ten thousand men, and openly  declared for Bajee Rao.    In the meantime Balloba, believing that the whole plot was the work  of Bajee Rao, determined to despatch him, as a prisoner, to a  fortress in the heart of Scindia's dominions. He sent him off with  a strong escort, under the charge of an officer named Sukaram  Ghatgay who, although having command only of a troop of one hundred  horse, belonged to an ancient and honourable family.    Balloba could hardly have made a worse choice. Ghatgay had a  daughter who was reported to be of exceptional beauty, and the  young Scindia had asked her father for her hand. Ghatgay, an  ambitious and enterprising man, had given no decided answer; not  from any real hesitation, for he saw how enormous would be the  advantage, to himself, of such an alliance; but in order to  increase Scindia's ardour by pretended opposition, and so to secure  the best terms possible for himself. The reason he gave would  appear natural to any Mahratta of good blood, as none of these  would have given a daughter of their house to one who, however high  in rank, had ancestors belonging to a low caste.    Upon the way, Bajee, who was aware of Scindia's wishes, and was  most anxious to obtain his goodwill, urged Ghatgay to give him his  daughter in marriage and, after much pretended hesitation, the  latter agreed to do so--on condition that Bajee would authorize him  to promise Scindia a large sum of money, as soon as he again  ascended the musnud; and that he would get the prince to appoint  him his prime minister, which post would be vacant at the overthrow  of Balloba. This being arranged, Bajee Rao pretended that he was  seriously ill; and Ghatgay therefore halted, with his escort, on  the banks of the Paira.    Taking with him his disguise as a countryman, Harry, as soon as he  learned that Ghatgay had started with Bajee, mounted and followed  him; and travelled, at some little distance in rear of the party,  until they halted. Then he went to the house of a cultivator, left  his horse there, and exchanged his dress as fighting man for that  of a countryman.    There was no occasion for him, now, to disguise his age or darken  his eyes and, as before, he hired a cart, bought some grain for  forage, some sacks of rice and other things, and boldly entered  Ghatgay's camp. As the prices he asked were low, Ghatgay purchased  the whole contents of his cart. When this was cleared, Harry left  his cattle and wandered about, saying that he and the animals  needed an hour's rest.    Presently he passed Bajee Rao, who was standing listlessly at the  door of a tent.    \"I am Puntojee,\" Harry said, as he passed. \"I followed you with the  horse, that I might help you to escape.\"    \"Stay and talk to me here,\" the young prince said. \"It will seem  that I am only passing my time in asking you questions about the  country.\"    \"I wanted to ascertain the road by which you will travel, after  crossing the river. I have money with me, and will endeavour to  raise a force of forty or fifty men; with which to make a sudden  attack upon your camp, after nightfall. I will bring a good horse  with me. If you will run out when you hear the uproar, I will ride  up with the spare horse. You will leap on to its back, and we can  gallop off.\"    \"You are a brave fellow, Puntojee, and I thank you heartily for  your offer; but,"]]]
