Indeed, it is now believed that most errors of  development, such as lead to the production of great physical defects,  are due to some cause within the embryo itself, and that most of them  take place in the first three or four weeks, when the mother is by no  means likely to influence the course of embryological development by her  mental attitude toward it, for the very good reason that she knows  nothing about it.    Unless she is immured or isolated from the world, nearly every expectant  mother sees many sights of the kind that, according to popular  tradition, cause \"marks.\" Why is it that results are so few? Why is it  that women doctors and nurses, who are constantly exposed to unpleasant  sights, have children that do not differ from those of other mothers?    Darwin, who knew how to think scientifically, saw that this is the  logical line of proof or disproof. When Sir Joseph Hooker, the botanist  and geologist who was his closest friend, wrote of a supposed case of  maternal impression, one of his kinswomen having insisted that a mole  which appeared on her child was the effect of fright upon herself for  having, before the birth of the child, blotted with sepia a copy of  Turner's _Liber Studiorum_ that had been lent her with special  injunctions to be careful, Darwin[27] replied: \"I should be very much  obliged, if at any future or leisure time you could tell me on what you  ground your doubtful belief in imagination of a mother affecting her  offspring. I have attended to the several statements scattered about,  but do not believe in more than accidental coincidences. W. Hunter told  my father, then in a lying-in hospital, that in many thousand cases he  had asked the mother, before her confinement, whether anything had  affected her imagination, and recorded the answers; and absolutely not  one case came right, though, when the child was anything remarkable,  they afterwards made the cap to fit.\"    Any doctor who has handled many maternity cases can call to mind  instances where every condition was present to perfection, for the  production of maternal impression, on the time-honored lines. None  occurred. Most mothers can, if they give the matter careful  consideration, duplicate this experience from their own. Why is it that  results are so rare?    That Darwin gave the true explanation of a great many of the alleged  cases is perfectly clear to us. When the child is born with any peculiar  characteristic, the mother hunts for some experience in the preceding  months that might explain it. If she succeeds in finding any experience  of her own at all resembling in its effects the effect which the infant  shows, she considers she has proved causation, has established a good  case of prenatal influence.    It is not causation; it is coincidence.    If the prospective mother plays or sings a great deal, with the idea of  giving her child a musical endowment, and the child actually turns out  to have musical talent, the mother at once recalls her yearning that  such might be the case; her assiduous practice which she hoped would be  of benefit to her child. She immediately decides that it did benefit  him, and she becomes a convinced witness to the belief in prenatal  culture. Has she not herself demonstrated it?    She has not. But if she would examine the child's heredity, she would  probably find a taste for music running in the germ-plasm. Her study and  practice had not the slightest effect on this hereditary disposition; it  is equally certain that the child would have been born with a taste for  music if its mother had devoted eight hours a day for nine months to  cultivating thoughts of hatred for the musical profession and repugnance  for everything that possesses rhythm or harmony.    It necessarily follows, then, that attempts to influence the inherent  nature of the child, physically or mentally, through \"prenatal culture,\"  are doomed to disappointment. The child develops along the lines of the  potentialities which existed in the two germ-cells that united to become  its origin. The course of its development can not be changed in any  specific way by any corresponding act or attitude of its mother, good  hygiene alone need be her concern.    It must necessarily follow that attempts to improve the race on a large  scale, by the general adoption of prenatal culture as an instrument of  eugenics, are useless.    Indeed, the logical implication of the teaching is the reverse of  eugenic. It would give a woman reason to think she might marry a man  whose heredity was most objectionable, and yet, by prenatal culture,  save her children from paying the inevitable penalty of this weak  heritage. The world has long shuddered over the future of the girl who  marries a man to reform him; but think what it means to the future of  the race if a superior girl, armed with correspondence school lessons in  prenatal culture, marries a man to reform his children!    Those who practice this doctrine are doomed to disillusion. The time  they spend on prenatal culture is not cultivating the child; it is  merely perpetuating a fallacy. Not only is their time thus spent  wasted, but worse, for they might have employed it in ways that really  would have benefited the child--in open-air exercise, for instance.    To recapitulate, the facts are:    (1) That there is, before birth, no connection between mother and child,  by which impressions on the mother's mind or body could be transmitted  to the child's mind or body.    (2) That in most cases the marks or defects whose origin is attributed  to maternal impression, must necessarily have been complete long before  the incident occurred which the mother, after the child's birth,  ascribes as the cause.    (3) That these phenomena usually do not occur when they are, and by  hypothesis ought to be, expected. The explanations are found after the  event, and that is regarded as causation which is really coincidence.    Pre-natal care as a euthenic measure is of course not only legitimate  but urgent. The embryo derives its entire nourishment from the mother;  and its development depends wholly on its supply of nourishment.  Anything which affects the supply of nourishment will affect the embryo  in a general, not a particular way. If the mother's mental and physical  condition be good, the supply of nourishment to the embryo is likely to  be good, and development will be normal. If, on the other hand, the  mother is constantly harassed by fear or hatred, her physical health  will suffer, she will be unable properly to nourish her developing  offspring, and it may be its poor physical condition when born,  indicates this.    Further, if the mother experiences a great mental or physical shock, it  may so upset her health that her child is not properly nourished, its  development is arrested, mentally as well as physically, and it is born  defective. H. H. Goddard, for example, tells[28] of a high-grade  imbecile in the Training School at Vineland, N. J. \"Nancy belongs to a  thoroughly normal, respectable family. There is nothing to account for  the condition unless one accepts the mother's theory. While it sounds  somewhat like the discarded theory of maternal impression, yet it is not  impossible that the fright and shock which the mother received may have  interfered with the nutrition of the unborn child and resulted in the  mental defect. The story in brief is as follows. Shortly before this  child was born, the mother was compelled to take care of a sister-in-law  who was in a similar condition and very ill with convulsions. Our  child's mother was many times frightened severely as her sister-in-law  was quite out of her mind.\"    It is easily understandable that any event which makes such an  impression on the mother as to affect her health, might so disturb the  normal functioning of her body that her child would be badly nourished,  or even poisoned. Such facts undoubtedly form the basis on which the  airy fabric of prenatal culture was reared by those who lived before the  days of scientific biology.    Thus, it is easy enough to see the real explanation of such cases as  those mentioned near the beginning of this discussion. The mothers who  fret and rebel over their maternity, she found, are likely to bear  neurotic children. It is obvious (1) that mothers who fret and rebel are  quite likely themselves to be neurotic in constitution, and the child  naturally gets its heredity from them: (2) that constant fretting and  rebellion would so affect the mother's health that her child would not  be properly nourished.    When, however, she goes on to draw the inference that \"self-control,  cheerfulness and love ... will practically insure you a child normal in  physique and nerves,\" we are obliged to stop. We know that what she says  is not true. If the child's heredity is bad, neither self-control,  cheerfulness, love, nor anything else known to science, can make that  heredity good.    At first thought, one may wish it were otherwise. There is something  inspiring in the idea of a mother overcoming the effect of heredity by  the sheer force of her own will-power. But perhaps in the long run it is  as well; for there are advantages on the other side. It should be a  satisfaction to mothers to know that their children will not be marked  or injured by untoward events in the antenatal days; that if the  child's heredity can not be changed for the better, neither can it be  changed for the worse.    The prenatal culturists and maternal-impressionists are trying to place  on her a responsibility which she need not bear. Obviously, it is the  mother who is most nearly concerned with the bogy of maternal  impressions, and it should make for her peace of mind to know that it is  nothing more than a bogy.

I must have legitimate children. It will be no  fault of mine if circumstances compel me to divorce Josephine; for I  will not, like Alexander of Macedon, conquer exclusively for the benefit  of my generals. I need an heir to my empire.\"    \"Sire, you have one in the son of the empress, noble King Eugene.\"    \"No,\" exclaimed the emperor, gloomily, \"the son of the Viscount de  Beauharnais cannot be heir to my throne. My blood does not flow in his  veins. Oh, why did the young Napoleon die! I had destined him to succeed  me, because he was of my blood, and a scion of my family.[12] Poor  Josephine! if her tears and prayers could have saved the child's life, I  should never have thought of taking another wife.\"    [Footnote 12: The oldest son of the King of Holland, Napoleon's brother,  and of Hortense, Josephine's daughter, had been declared Napoleon's  successor and adopted son. He died of croup, in 1805, in his seventh  year.]    \"What!\" exclaimed Duroc, in dismay, \"your majesty thinks of repudiating  the empress!\"    \"My heart never will repudiate her,\" replied Napoleon, drawing a sigh.  \"I shall always love her, for she deserves it. She is generous and  high-minded, good and graceful. I never loved another woman as I love  her--and never shall. Judge, therefore, what a cruel blow it will be to  my heart, should I be compelled to separate from her.\"    \"If you should, sire,\" said Duroc, in a voice quivering with  emotion,--\"if you repudiate the empress, you would thereby sign your own  death-warrant, and Josephine would not survive it.\"    \"She will have to survive it like myself,\" exclaimed the emperor,  impetuously. \"I shall suffer no less--nay, I shall suffer more than she,  for she never loved me as I love her. Her tears will fall for the lost  splendor of the throne--not for her husband. But I shall bewail the  beloved wife.\"    \"No, sire,\" said Duroc, almost indignantly, \"you are unjust. The empress  loves you--you alone. She accepted the crown reluctantly and with  tearful eyes, and will not weep when she loses it. She will mourn for  her husband only, whom she adores, and not for the crown which adorns  but also oppresses her brow.\"    \"Ah, what a warm advocate the empress has!\" exclaimed Napoleon, smiling.  \"Do you really believe that she loves me so disinterestedly?\"    \"Sire, I am convinced of it, and so is your majesty. The empress loves  in you her dear Bonaparte, and not the emperor. She loves you more  ardently than any other woman could do. Sire, permit an old, well-tried  friend and servant to warn you. Do not banish Josephine from your heart,  for she is your guardian angel.\"    Napoleon did not reply immediately, but looked melancholy and  abstracted.    \"It is true,\" he said, after a long pause, \"Josephine brought success;  until I married her every thing around me was forbidding and dark. She  appeared like a sun by my side, and we rose together.\"    \"Sire, all will darken again, if you suffer your sun to set.\"    \"Ah, bah! these are nothing but fantastic dreams!\" exclaimed Napoleon,  after a brief silence. \"I am the architect of my fortune--I alone.  Josephine did not assist me in erecting my edifice; she only adorned it  with her smiling grace. I shall do what fate and my people have a right  to expect of me, but I do not say that it must be done immediately. I  have time enough to wait; for as yet I do not stand on the pinnacle to  which I am aspiring. My plans are not yet accomplished. I hope that I  shall not die at so early an age as my father. I need ten years more to  carry out my purposes. A sovereign ought not to set too narrow limits to  his wishes; but mine--they are boundless. Like the conqueror of Darius,  I must rule the world, and I hope that my desire will one day be  fulfilled. Nay, I feel convinced that I and my family will occupy all  the thrones of Europe. Then it will be time for me to have a wife who  will give an heir to my empire, and a son to my heart. Until then, my  friend, keep the matter secret; do not mention what I have told you. The  portraits of the old kings, with their surly faces, have impressed me  very disagreeably, and it is in defiance of them that I say, I will one  day have a wife--a daughter of the Caesars--who will think it an honor to  bear a son to the modern Caesar! When the time comes, however, I shall  remind you of this hour, and then request you, in the name of the  confidence which I have reposed in you, to prepare my poor, beloved  Josephine for the blow that is menacing her and myself, and which I then  shall ward off no longer. But a truce to these matters! Let us go to  Sans-souci. Come!\"    \"Sire, before your majesty has dined?\"    \"Ah, you are hungry, then? You would like to dine?\"    \"Sire, I believe all the gentlemen entertain the same desire. None of us  have tasted food for eight hours.\"    \"Eight hours, and you are already hungry again? Truly, this German air  exerts a bad effect upon my brave marshals. Like the Germans, you want  to eat all the time. Well, let it so be; as we are in Germany, I will  comply with your wishes. Let us dine, therefore, and afterward go to the  country-palace of Frederick II. Be kind enough to issue your orders,  grand-marshal. Let the horses be ready; we shall set out as soon as we  have dined. Tell Roustan to come to me!\"    Napoleon was now again the sovereign, and it was in this capacity that  he dismissed Duroc, who left the room with a respectful bow. Roustan,  who had already heard the order in the anteroom, glided past him, to  assist Constant in the emperor's toilet.          CHAPTER IX.    SANS-SOUCI.      Duroc hastened once more through the rooms and halls to the corridor,  where the palace-steward came to meet him.    \"Dinner is ready, grand marshal,\" he said.    \"And have you set another table in the adjoining room?\"    \"Your orders have been punctually obeyed.\"    \"Be good enough, then, to conduct me to the large dining-hall.\"    The steward bowed in silence, and led the way. All the marshals and  generals were already assembled when Duroc entered.    \"Gentlemen,\" he said, smiling, \"his majesty is now occupied with his  toilet, and Roustan has assured me that it would last half an hour. We  have half an hour, therefore, to take our dinner.\" Followed by the  others, he went into the next room. A table had been set there, and  appetizing odors invited them to sit down to it.    \"Now, steward, have every thing served up as quick as possible. We have  but twenty minutes left.\" During that time there reigned profound  silence, only now and then interrupted by a word or a brief remark. The  marshals contented themselves in making the viands disappear, and  emptying the bottles. Duroc, who had frequently cast anxious glances at  the large clock, now rose hastily. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"our time is  up, and we must be ready for the emperor's dinner. I will go to his  majesty, and conduct him to the dining-hall. I hope all of you have  eaten well, so as not to need much of the official repast to which we  are going. The emperor has graciously ordered us all to dine with him.  Be so kind as to repair to the hall.\"    When Napoleon entered, a few minutes later, preceded by Duroc, he found  all the marshals assembled. The dinner commenced, and he, it seemed, was  no less hungry than his generals, for not only did he eat his soup with  the utmost rapidity, but when he saw one of his favorite dishes placed  near him, he smiled and nodded kindly to the grand marshal, who was  standing at his right, and presented him a glass of wine.    \"See how attentive these dear Germans are!\" he said. \"If I am not  mistaken, this is my favorite dish, _fricassee a la Marengo.\"_    \"Yes, sire, I sent the bill of fare hither last night by the courier  who announced your majesty's arrival, and I am glad to see that it has  been punctually attended to.\"    \"So these German cooks know already how to prepare a _fricassee a la  Marengo?_ Who has taught them this?\"    \"Your majesty; your majesty is now the cook and butler for all  Germany--everybody has become familiar with your favorite dishes.\"    The emperor smiled. Placing a piece of bread on his fork, he dipped it  into the dish, and repeated this several times; and when the grand  marshal placed before him a silver plate, filled with a portion of the  same, he commenced to eat rapidly. Aware of his habit, his attendants  had taken care that the pieces of meat were sufficiently small, and the  whole dish not too hot. He began to eat the meat with a fork, and the  sauce with a spoon, but he seemed to regard both as too inconvenient;  for he laid them aside, and, after the fashion of the Turks, used his  delicate white hands, adorned with diamond-rings.[13] Scarcely twelve  minutes had elapsed when he rose. The grand marshal immediately  presented to him a golden basin and a napkin to wash his hands.    [Footnote 13: Constant, for many years Napoleon's devoted _valet de  chambre_, gives in his reminiscences a detailed account of the emperor's  habits, and writes as follows about his mode of dining: \"The great  rapidity with which the emperor was accustomed to eat was frequently  very injurious to his health. One of the immediate effects of this habit  was, that he did not eat very cleanly. He liked to use his fingers  instead of a fork, and, indeed, instead of a spoon. Great care was taken  always to place a favorite dish before him. He partook of it in the  manner above described, dipping his bread into the sauce, which did not  prevent the other guests from eating of the same dish, or at least  such as wished to do so, and there were "]]]
