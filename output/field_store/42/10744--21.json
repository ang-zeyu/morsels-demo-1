(#17)"],[1,"that is mine,    Whilst virtue his footsteps impress;          Such I'd choose for my mate,          Whether sooner or late:    Tell me, Ladies, what think you of this?    \"The chief point to be regarded,\" says Lady Pennington in her Advice to  her Daughters, \"in the choice of a companion for life, is a really  virtuous principle--an unaffected goodness of heart. Without this, you  will be continually shocked by indecency, and pained by impiety. So  numerous have been the unhappy victims to the ridiculous opinion, _a  reformed libertine makes the best husband_--that, did not experience  daily evince the contrary, one would believe it impossible for a girl  who has a tolerable degree of common understanding, to be made the dupe  of so erroneous a position, which has not the least shadow of reason for  its foundation, and which a small share of observation will prove to be  false in fact. A man who has been conversant with the worst sort of  women, is very apt to contract a bad opinion of, and a contempt for, the  sex in general. Incapable of esteeming any, he is suspicious of all;  jealous without cause, angry without provocation, his own disturbed  imagination is a continued source of ill-humor. To this is frequently  joined a bad habit of body, the natural consequence of an irregular  life, which gives an additional sourness to the temper. What rational  prospect of happiness can there be with such a companion? And, that this  is the general character of those who are called _reformed rakes_,  observation will certify. But, admit there may be some exceptions, it is  a hazard upon which no considerate woman would venture the peace of her  whole life. The vanity of those girls who believe themselves capable of  working miracles of this kind, and who give up their persons to men of  libertine principles, upon the wild expectation of reclaiming them,  justly deserves the disappointment which it will generally meet with;  for, believe me, a wife is, of all persons, the least likely to succeed  in such an attempt. Be it your care to find that virtue in a lover which  you must never hope to form in a husband. Good sense, and good nature,  are almost equally requisite. If the former is wanting, it will be next  to an impossibility for you to esteem the person, of whose behavior you  may have cause to be ashamed. Mutual esteem is as essential to happiness  in the married state, as mutual affection. Without the latter, every day  will bring with it some fresh cause of vexation, until repeated quarrels  produce a coldness, which will settle into an irreconcilable aversion,  and you will become, not only each other's torment, but the object of  contempt to your family, and to your acquaintance.    \"This quality of good nature is, of all others, the most difficult to be  ascertained, on account of the general mistake of blending it with  good-humor, as if they were in themselves the same; whereas, in fact, no  two principles of action are more essentially different. But this may  require some explanation. By good nature, I mean that true benevolence,  which partakes in the felicity of every individual within the reach of  its ability, which relieves the distressed, comforts the afflicted,  diffuses blessings, and communicates happiness, far as its sphere of  action can extend; and which, in the private scenes of life, will shine  conspicuous in the dutiful son, in the affectionate husband, the  indulgent father, the faithful friend, and in the compassionate master  both to man and beast. Good humor, on the other hand, is nothing more  than a cheerful, pleasing deportment, arising either from a natural  gaiety of mind, or from an affection of popularity, joined to an  affability of behavior, the result of good breeding, and from a ready  compliance with the taste of every company. This kind of mere good humor  is, by far, the most striking quality. It is frequently mistaken for and  complimented with the superior name of _real good nature_. A man, by  this specious appearance, has often acquired that appellation who, in  all the actions of private life, has been a morose, cruel, revengeful,  sullen, haughty tyrant. Let them put on the cap, whose temples fit the  galling wreath!    \"A man of a truly benevolent disposition, and formed to promote the  happiness of all around him, may sometimes, perhaps, from an ill habit  of body, an accidental vexation, or from a commendable openness of  heart, above the meanness of disguise, be guilty of little sallies of  peevishness, or of ill humor, which, carrying the appearance of ill  nature, may be unjustly thought to proceed from it, by persons who are  unacquainted with his true character, and who, take ill humor and ill  nature to be synonymous terms, though in reality they bear not the least  analogy to each other. In order to the forming a right judgment, it is  absolutely necessary to observe this distinction, which will effectually  secure you from the dangerous error of taking the shadow for the  substance, an irretrievable mistake, pregnant with innumerable  consequent evils!    \"From what has been said, it plainly appears, that the criterion of this  amiable virtue is not to be taken for the general opinion; mere good  humor being, to all intents and purposes, sufficient in this particular,  to establish the public voice in favor of a man utterly devoid of every  humane and benevolent affection of heart. It is only from the less  conspicuous scenes of life, the more retired sphere of action, from the  artless tenor of domestic conduct, that the real character can, with any  certainty be drawn. These, undisguised, proclaim the man. But, as they  shun the glare of light, nor court the noise of popular applause, they  pass unnoticed, and are seldom known till after an intimate  acquaintance. The best method, therefore, to avoid the deception in this  case, is to lay no stress on outward appearances, which are too often  fallacious, but to take the rule of judging from the simple unpolished  sentiments of those whose dependent connections give them undeniable  certainty; who not only see, but who hourly feel, the good or bad effect  of that disposition, to which they are subjected. By this, I mean, that  if a man is equally respected, esteemed, and beloved by his dependants  and domestics, you may justly conclude, he has that true good nature,  that real benevolence, which delights in communicating felicity, and  enjoys the satisfaction it diffuses. But if by these he is despised and  hated, served merely from a principle of fear, devoid of affection,  which is ever easily discoverable, whatever may be his public character,  however favorable the general opinion, be assured, that his disposition  is such as can never be productive of domestic happiness. I have been  the more particular on this head, as it is one of the most essential  qualifications to be regarded, and of all others the most liable to be  mistaken.    \"Never be prevailed with, my dear, to give your hand to a person  defective in these material points. Secure of virtue, of good nature,  and understanding, in a husband, you may be secure of happiness. Without  the two former it is unattainable. Without the latter in a tolerable  degree, it must be very imperfect.    \"Remember, however, that infallibility is not the property of man, or  you may entail disappointment on yourself, by expecting what is never to  be found. The best men are sometimes inconsistent with themselves. They  are liable to be hurried, by sudden starts of passion, into expressions  and actions, which their _cooler_ reason will condemn. They may have  some oddities of behavior, and some peculiarities of temper. They may be  subject to accidental ill humor, or to whimsical complaints. Blemishes  of this kind often shade the brightest character; but they are never  destructive of mutual felicity, unless when they are made so by an  improper resentment, or by an ill-judged opposition. When cooled, and in  his usual temper, the man of understanding, if he has been wrong, will  suggest to himself all that could be urged against him. The man of good  nature will, unupbraided, own his error. Immediate contradiction is,  therefore, wholly unserviceable, and highly imprudent; an after  repetition is equally unnecessary and injudicious. Any peculiarities in  the temper or behavior ought to be properly represented in the tenderest  and in the most friendly manner. If the representation of them is made  discreetly, it will generally be well taken. But if they are so habitual  as not easily to be altered, strike not too often upon the unharmonious  string. Rather let them pass unobserved. Such a cheerful compliance will  better cement your union; and they may be made easy to yourself, by  reflecting on the superior good qualities by which these trifling faults  are so greatly overbalanced.    \"You must remember, my dear, these rules are laid down on the  supposition of your being united to a person who possesses the three  qualifications for happiness before mentioned. In this case no farther  direction is necessary, but that you strictly perform the duty of a  wife, namely, to love, to honor, and obey. The two first articles are a  tribute so indispensably due to _merit_, that they must be paid by  _inclination_--and they naturally lead to the performance of the last,  which will not only be easy, but a pleasing task, since nothing can ever  be enjoined by such a person that is in itself improper, and a few  things will, that can, with any reason, be disagreeable to you.    \"The being united to a man of irreligious principles, makes it  impossible to discharge a great part of the proper duty of a wife. To  name but one instance, obedience will be rendered impracticable, by  frequent injunctions inconsistent with, and contrary to, the higher  obligations of morality. This is not a supposition, but is a certainty  founded upon facts, which I have too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2612"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 3 (#17)"],[1,"pronounced with respect by many who will perhaps learn with surprise  and disappointment the real nature of the law which they have been  accustomed to hold in honour.    Several statutes which had been passed between the accession of Queen  Elizabeth and the Revolution required all people under severe penalties  to attend the services of the Church of England, and to abstain from  attending conventicles. The Toleration Act did not repeal any of these  statutes, but merely provided that they should not be construed to  extend to any person who should testify his loyalty by taking the Oaths  of Allegiance and Supremacy, and his Protestantism by subscribing the  Declaration against Transubstantiation.    The relief thus granted was common between the dissenting laity and  the dissenting clergy. But the dissenting clergy had some peculiar  grievances. The Act of Uniformity had laid a mulct of a hundred pounds  on every person who, not having received episcopal ordination, should  presume to administer the Eucharist. The Five Mile Act had driven many  pious and learned ministers from their houses and their friends, to live  among rustics in obscure villages of which the name was not to be seen  on the map. The Conventicle Act had imposed heavy fines on divines who  should preach in any meeting of separatists; and, in direct opposition  to the humane spirit of our common law, the Courts were enjoined to  construe this Act largely and beneficially for the suppressing of  dissent and for the encouraging of informers. These severe statutes were  not repealed, but were, with many conditions and precautions, relaxed.  It was provided that every dissenting minister should, before he  exercised his function, profess under his hand his belief in the  articles of the Church of England, with a few exceptions. The  propositions to which he was not required to assent were these; that the  Church has power to regulate ceremonies; that the doctrines set forth in  the Book of Homilies are sound; and that there is nothing superstitious  and idolatrous in the ordination service. If he declared himself a  Baptist, he was also excused from affirming that the baptism of infants  is a laudable practice. But, unless his conscience suffered him to  subscribe thirty-four of the thirty-nine articles, and the greater part  of two other articles, he could not preach without incurring all the  punishments which the Cavaliers, in the day of their power and their  vengeance, had devised for the tormenting and ruining of schismatical  teachers.    The situation of the Quaker differed from that of other dissenters,  and differed for the worse. The Presbyterian, the Independent, and  the Baptist had no scruple about the Oath of Supremacy. But the Quaker  refused to take it, not because he objected to the proposition that  foreign sovereigns and prelates have no jurisdiction in England, but  because his conscience would not suffer him to swear to any proposition  whatever. He was therefore exposed to the severity of part of that penal  code which, long before Quakerism existed, had been enacted against  Roman Catholics by the Parliaments of Elizabeth. Soon after the  Restoration, a severe law, distinct from the general law which applied  to all conventicles, had been passed against meetings of Quakers. The  Toleration Act permitted the members of this harmless sect to hold  their assemblies in peace, on condition of signing three documents, a  declaration against Transubstantiation, a promise of fidelity to the  government, and a confession of Christian belief. The objections which  the Quaker had to the Athanasian phraseology had brought on him the  imputation of Socinianism; and the strong language in which he sometimes  asserted that he derived his knowledge of spiritual things directly from  above had raised a suspicion that he thought lightly of the authority  of Scripture. He was therefore required to profess his faith in the  divinity of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and in the inspiration of the  Old and New Testaments.    Such were the terms on which the Protestant dissenters of England were,  for the first time, permitted by law to worship God according to their  own conscience. They were very properly forbidden to assemble with  barred doors, but were protected against hostile intrusion by a  clause which made it penal to enter a meeting house for the purpose of  molesting the congregation.    As if the numerous limitations and precautions which have been mentioned  were insufficient, it was emphatically declared that the legislature  did not intend to grant the smallest indulgence to any Papist, or to any  person who denied the doctrine of the Trinity as that doctrine is set  forth in the formularies of the Church of England.    Of all the Acts that have ever been passed by Parliament, the Toleration  Act is perhaps that which most strikingly illustrates the peculiar vices  and the peculiar excellences of English legislation. The science  of Politics bears in one respect a close analogy to the science of  Mechanics. The mathematician can easily demonstrate that a certain  power, applied by means of a certain lever or of a certain system of  pulleys, will suffice to raise a certain weight. But his demonstration  proceeds on the supposition that the machinery is such as no load will  bend or break. If the engineer, who has to lift a great mass of real  granite by the instrumentality of real timber and real hemp, should  absolutely rely on the propositions which he finds in treatises on  Dynamics, and should make no allowance for the imperfection of his  materials, his whole apparatus of beams, wheels, and ropes would soon  come down in ruin, and, with all his geometrical skill, he would be  found a far inferior builder to those painted barbarians who, though  they never heard of the parallelogram of forces, managed to pile up  Stonehenge. What the engineer is to the mathematician, the active  statesman is to the contemplative statesman. It is indeed most important  that legislators and administrators should be versed in the philosophy  of government, as it is most important that the architect, who has to  fix an obelisk on its pedestal, or to hang a tubular bridge over an  estuary, should be versed in the philosophy of equilibrium and motion.  But, as he who has actually to build must bear in mind many things never  noticed by D'Alembert and Euler, so must he who has actually to govern  be perpetually guided by considerations to which no allusion can be  found in the writings of Adam Smith or Jeremy Bentham. The perfect  lawgiver is a just temper between the mere man of theory, who can see  nothing but general principles, and the mere man of business, who can  see nothing but particular circumstances. Of lawgivers in whom the  speculative element has prevailed to the exclusion of the practical,  the world has during the last eighty years been singularly fruitful.  To their wisdom Europe and America have owed scores of abortive  constitutions, scores of constitutions which have lived just long enough  to make a miserable noise, and have then gone off in convulsions. But in  the English legislature the practical element has always predominated,  and not seldom unduly predominated, over the speculative. To think  nothing of symmetry and much of convenience; never to remove an anomaly  merely because it is an anomaly; never to innovate except when some  grievance is felt; never to innovate except so far as to get rid of the  grievance; never to lay down any proposition of wider extent than the  particular case for which it is necessary to provide; these are the  rules which have, from the age of John to the age of Victoria, generally  guided the deliberations of our two hundred and fifty Parliaments. Our  national distaste for whatever is abstract in political science amounts  undoubtedly to a fault. But it is, perhaps, a fault on the right side.  That we have been far too slow to improve our laws must be admitted.  But, though in other countries there may have occasionally been more  rapid progress, it would not be easy to name any other country in which  there has been so little retrogression.    The Toleration Act approaches very near to the idea of a great  English law. To a jurist, versed in the theory of legislation, but not  intimately acquainted with the temper of the sects and parties into  which the nation was divided at the time of the Revolution, that Act  would seem to be a mere chaos of absurdities and contradictions. It will  not bear to be tried by sound general principles. Nay, it will not bear  to be tried by any principle, sound or unsound. The sound principle  undoubtedly is, that mere theological error ought not to be punished by  the civil magistrate. This principle the Toleration Act not only does  not recognise, but positively disclaims. Not a single one of the cruel  laws enacted against nonconformists by the Tudors or the Stuarts is  repealed. Persecution continues to be the general rule. Toleration is  the exception. Nor is this all. The freedom which is given to  conscience is given in the most capricious manner. A Quaker, by making  a declaration of faith in general terms, obtains the full benefit of  the Act without signing one of the thirty-nine Articles. An Independent  minister, who is perfectly willing to make the declaration required  from the Quaker, but who has doubts about six or seven of the Articles,  remains still subject to the penal laws. Howe is liable to punishment if  he preaches before he has solemnly declared his assent to the Anglican  doctrine touching the Eucharist. Penn, who altogether rejects  the Eucharist, is at perfect liberty to preach without making any  declaration whatever on the subject.    These are some of the obvious faults which must strike every person who  examines the Toleration Act by that standard of just reason which is the  same in all countries and in all ages."]]]
