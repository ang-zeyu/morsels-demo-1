I'll be there.  That is, I  will if I am not caught on the way.\"    Meanwhile over on the Green Meadows Peter Rabbit was looking for  Danny Meadow Mouse.  Danny's home was not far from the dear Old  Briar-patch, and he and Peter were and still are very good friends.  So Peter knew just about where to look for Danny and it didn't  take him long to find him.    \"Hello, Peter!  You look as if you have something very important  on your mind,\" was the greeting of Danny Meadow Mouse as Peter  came hurrying up.    \"I have,\" said Peter.  \"It is a message for you.  Old Mother Nature  says for you to be on hand at sun-up to-morrow when school opens  over in the Green Forest.  Of course you will be there.\"    \"Of course,\" replied Danny in the most matter-of-fact tone.  \"Of  course.  If Old Mother Nature really sent me that message--\"    \"She really did,\" interrupted Peter.    \"There isn't anything for me to do but obey,\" finished Danny.  Then  his face became very sober.  \"That is a long way for me to go,  Peter,\" said he.  \"I wouldn't take such a long journey for anything  or for anybody else.  Old Mother Nature knows, and if she sent for  me she must be sure I can make the trip safely.  What time did you  say I must be there?\"    \"At sun-up,\" replied Peter.  \"Shall I call for you on my way there?\"    Danny shook his head.  Then he began to laugh.  \"What are you  laughing at?\" demanded Peter.    \"At the very idea of me with my short legs trying to keep up with  you,\" replied Danny.  \"I wish you would sit up and take a good  look all around to make sure that Old Man Coyote and Reddy Fox and  Redtail the Hawk and Black Pussy, that pesky Cat from Farmer Brown's,  are nowhere about.\"    Peter obligingly sat up and looked this way and looked that way and  looked the other way.  No one of whom he or Danny Meadow Mouse need  be afraid was to be seen.  He said as much, then asked, \"Why did  you want to know, Danny?\"    \"Because I am going to start at once,\" replied Danny.    \"Start for where?\" asked Peter, looking much puzzled.    \"Start for school of course,\" replied Danny rather shortly.    \"But school doesn't begin until sun-up to-morrow,\" protested Peter.    \"Which is just the reason I am going to start now,\" retorted Danny.  \"If I should put off starting until the last minute I might not  get there at all.  I would have to hurry, and it is difficult to  hurry and watch for danger at the same time.  I've noticed that  people who put things off to the last minute and then have to  hurry are quite apt to rush headlong into trouble.  The way is  clear now, so I am going to start.  I can take my time and keep  a proper watch for danger.  I'll see you over there in the  morning, Peter.\"    Danny turned and disappeared in one of his private little paths  though the tall grass.  Peter noticed that he was headed towards  the Green Forest.    When Peter and the others arrived for school the next morning they  found Whitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse waiting with  Old Mother Nature.  Safe in her presence, they seemed to have lost  much of their usual timidity.  Whitefoot was sitting on the end of  a log and Danny was on the ground just beneath him.    \"I want all the rest of you to look well at these two little cousins  and notice how unlike two cousins can be,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"Whitefoot, who is quite as often called Deer Mouse as Wood Mouse,  is one of the prettiest of the entire Mouse family.  I suspect he  is called Deer Mouse because the upper part of his coat is such a  beautiful fawn color.  Notice that the upper side of his long slim  tail is of the same color, while the under side is white, as is the  whole under part of Whitefoot.  Also those dainty feet are white,  hence his name.  See what big, soft black eyes he has, and notice  that those delicate ears are of good size.    \"His tail is covered with short fine hairs, instead of being naked  as is the tail of Nibbler the House mouse, of whom I will tell you  later.  Whitefoot loves the Green Forest, but out in parts of the  Far West where there is no Green Forest he lives on the brushy  plains.  He is a good climber and quite at home in the trees.  There he seems almost like a tiny Squirrel.  Tell us, Whitefoot,  where you make your home and what you eat.\"    \"My home just now,\" replied Whitefoot, \"is in a certain hollow in a  certain dead limb of a certain tree.  I suspect that a member of the  Woodpecker family made that hollow, but no one was living there when  I found it.  Mrs. Whitefoot and I have made a soft, warm nest there  and wouldn't trade homes with any one.  We have had our home in a  hollow log on the ground, in an old stump, in a hole we dug in the  ground under a rock, and in an old nest of some bird.  That was in  a tall bush.  We roofed that nest over and make a little round  doorway on the under side.  Once we raised a family in a box in a  dark corner of Farmer Brown's sugar camp.    \"I eat all sorts of things--seeds, nuts, insects and meat when I  can get it.  I store up food for winter, as all wise and thrifty  people do.\"    \"I suppose that means that you do not sleep as Johnny Chuck does in  winter,\" remarked Peter Rabbit.    \"I should say not!\" exclaimed Whitefoot.  \"I like winter.  It is fun  to run about on the snow.  Haven't you ever seen my tracks, Peter?\"    \"I have, lots of times,\" spoke up Jumper the Hare.  \"Also I've seen you  skipping about after dark.  I guess you don't care much for sunlight.\"    \"I don't,\" replied Whitefoot.  \"I sleep most of the time during the  day, and work and play at night.  I feel safer then.  But on dull  days I often come out.  It is the bright sunlight I don't like.  That  is one reason I stick to the Green Forest.  I don't see how Cousin  Danny stands it out there on the Green Meadows.  Now I guess it is  his turn.\"    Every one looked at Danny Meadow Mouse.  In appearance he was as  unlike Whitefoot as it was possible to be and still be a Mouse.  There was nothing pretty or graceful about Danny.  He wasn't dainty  at all.  His body was rather stout, looking stouter than it really  was because his fur was quite long.  His head was blunt, and he  seemed to have no neck at all, though of course he did have one.  His eyes were small, like little black beads.  His ears were almost  hidden in his hair.  His legs were short and his tail was quite  short, as if it had been cut off when half grown.  No, those two  cousins didn't look a bit alike.  Danny felt most uncomfortable  as the others compared him with pretty Whitefoot.  He knew he was  homely, but never before had he felt it quite so keenly.  Old  Mother Nature saw and understood.    \"It isn't how we look, but what we are and what we do and how we  fit into our particular places in life that count,\" said she.  \"Now, Danny is a homely little fellow, but I know, and I know that  he knows that he is just fitted for the life he lives, and he lives  it more successfully for being just as he is.    \"Danny is a lover of the fields and meadows where there is little  else but grass in which to hide.  Everything about him is just  suited for living there.  Isn't that so, Danny?\"    \"Yes'm, I guess so,\" replied Danny.  \"Sometimes my tail does seem  dreadfully short to look well.\"    Everybody laughed, even Danny himself.  Then he remembered how once  Reddy Fox had so nearly caught him that one of Reddy's black paws  had touched the tip of his tail.  Had that tail been any longer  Reddy would have caught him by it.  Danny's face cleared and he  hastened to declare, \"After all, my tail suits me just as it is.\"    \"Wisely spoken, Danny,\" said Old Mother Nature.  \"Now it is your  turn to tell how you live and what you eat and anything else of  interest about yourself.\"    \"I guess there isn't much interesting about me,\" began Danny  modestly.  \"I'm just one of the plain, common little folks.  I guess everybody knows me so well there is nothing for me  to tell.\"    \"Some of them may know all about you, but I don't,\" declared  Jumper the Hare.  \"I never go out on the Green Meadows where you  live.  How do you get about in all that tall grass?\"    \"Oh, that's easy enough,\" replied Danny.  \"I cut little paths in  all directions.\"    \"Just the way I do in the dear Old Briar-patch,\" interrupted  Peter Rabbit.    \"I keep those little paths clear and clean so that there never is  anything in my way to trip me up when I have to run for safety,\"  continued Danny.  \"When the grass gets tall those little paths are  almost like little tunnels.  The time I dread most is when Farmer  Brown cuts the grass for hay.  I not only have to watch out for that  dreadful mowing machine, but when the hay has been taken away the  grass is so short that it is hard work for me to keep out of sight.    \"I sometimes dig a short burrow and at the end of it make a nice nest  of dry grass.  Sometimes in summer Mrs. Danny and I make our nest on  the surface of the ground in a hollow or in a clump of tall grass,  especially if the ground is low and wet.  We have several good-sized  families in a year.  All Meadow Mice believe in large families, and  that is probably why there are more Meadow Mice than any other Mice  in the country.  I forgot to say that I am also called Field Mouse.\"    \"And it is because there are so many of your family and they require  so much to eat that you do a great deal of damage to grass and other  crops,\" spoke up Old Mother Nature.  \"You see,\" she explained to the  others, \"Danny eats grass, clover, bulbs, roots, seeds and garden  vegetables.  He also eats some insects.  He sometimes puts away a  few seeds for the winter, but depends chiefly on finding enough to  eat, for he is active all winter.  He tunnels about under the snow  in search of food.  When other food is hard to find he eats bark,  and then he sometimes does great damage in young orchards.

While at Benares the Gospel has to encounter peculiar opposition, it has  some marked advantages as a mission-field. The missionary, as he moves  about, meets with people from all parts of India. While these speak  different languages, many know enough of the languages spoken at Benares  to admit of a measure of intelligent intercourse with them. Vast  multitudes come from the widely extended region over which the  Hindustanee and Hindee prevail. While many go to Benares, we may suppose  the great majority, urged by the gregarious feeling so powerful all the  world over, happy to find themselves among the multitude, hoping to get  some religious benefit, and sure at any rate, as they acknowledge, of  amusement, we cannot doubt there are among them earnest souls--how many  it is impossible to say--who are ill at ease, and have a craving for  rest and satisfaction. These persons are in the state of mind to which  the Gospel is specially adapted, and it is very desirous for the  missionary to come into contact with them. Missionaries have fallen in  with persons of this class, and among them there have been pleasing  instances of conversion. There are individuals now in distant parts of  India living Christian lives, who were led to embrace Christ as their  Saviour by what they heard at Benares. Many Christian books have been  circulated among pilgrims to the sacred city. These are taken to their  homes, we may hope sooner or later to be read by them to their spiritual  benefit. Again and again bread cast on the waters has been found after  many days.    The greed of the Pundas and Gungaputrs of Benares is notorious. Many a  poor pilgrim has suffered from their exactions, and we may suppose that  reverence for the sacred city has received a shock under such treatment  similar to that which Luther experienced on his visit to Rome. While  Hinduism is no doubt greatly strengthened by the resort of the people to  Benares, much done and endured there is well fitted to alienate the more  thoughtful of the visitors; and so far as they are alienated from the  prevailing superstition, the more likely they are to listen patiently  and candidly to the Christian preacher.    [Sidenote: PROSPECT OF SUCCESS.]    I conclude these remarks on Benares as a mission sphere by observing  that marked success there would have a marvellous effect on the  evangelization of India. The news would soon spread that Hinduism was  drying up at its fountain, and that its power could not be much longer  maintained. We know that Hinduism itself has undergone great, we may say  radical, changes, since Kasee became one of its principal seats, if not  its head-quarters. There Buddhism was first preached, and from it  Buddhism went forth to all Eastern Asia. There it was for a time  predominant, but Hinduism again obtained supremacy, and drove its rival  from the field. For centuries, Hinduism under the form of devotion to  Shiva Mahadeo, the Great God, as they delight to call him, has had full  sway. Is his dominion to last for ever? Are the people to be for ever in  the slough of idolatry and superstition? We cannot believe that they  are, until we abandon all trust in Him who rightly claims all human  hearts, and whose grace is sufficient to enforce these claims. We know  not when, we know not how, but we do know that even in Benares, as all  the world over, our blessed Saviour will take to Himself His great power  and reign. Even now entrance has been gained for the truth of God,  hearts have been won by it, and Christian churches have been formed. The  first-fruits have been gathered, and the harvest will come. Are we  allowing imagination to take the reins at the expense of judgment, when  we indulge the hope, that as in former days Buddhist preachers went  forth from Benares to the millions of Eastern Asia with the lessons of  Gautama, the Brahmans of Benares, accepting Jesus as their Saviour, will  go forth with His Gospel to diffuse it far and wide among the nations of  India, and then, with their converts, make their way to the remotest  East? Let us not say, \"If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might  this thing be?\" but rather, \"Who hath despised the day of small things?\"  The Messiah \"shall build the temple, and He shall bear the glory.\"          CHAPTER IX.    MY SECOND YEAR IN BENARES.      In beginning this chapter it is fitting I should mention that shortly  after entering on my second year an event occurred of transcendent  importance to me, which has contributed to my personal comfort and  missionary usefulness as nothing else could have done--my marriage with  the object of my choice, who has been, through God's great goodness,  spared to me through all the intervening years.    Before the close of my first year I had a striking illustration of the  vicissitudes of Indian life, and of consequent difficulty in prosecuting  the missionary enterprise. On reaching Benares at the end of March,  1839, I found three missionaries of our society, Messrs. Buyers,  Shurman, and Lyon. Within a month of my arrival we were joined by a  German missionary and his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Sommers. Towards the end of  autumn Mr. and Mrs. Lyon left, owing to the failure of Mrs. Lyon's  health. They were followed three months afterwards by Dr. and Mrs.  Sommers, owing to Mrs. Sommers' illness. My second year was advanced  only a few months, when Mr. and Mrs. Buyers, after a residence of nearly  ten years, departed for Europe. Dr. Sommers had remained too short a  time to render any service. Mr. Lyon had made excellent progress in the  language, and promised to be a very efficient missionary; but, to our  great regret, he was obliged to leave. Mr. Buyers was in his prime, and  was well equipped for service. Thus within eighteen months the staff of  the mission was reduced from five to two, and one of these too young and  inexperienced to do anything more than help his senior brother. In June,  1841, we were joined by the Rev. D. G. Watt, and early in 1842 by the  Rev. J. H. Budden. These much-esteemed brethren still survive, and have  done excellent service in the cause of Christ; but both suffered much  from the climate, and their stay at Benares was too short to admit of  their doing there what their hearts were bent on doing.    [Sidenote: THE FAILURE OF HEALTH.]    I have not the means of comparing our Indian missions with missions in  other parts of the world, but I believe our losses by the failure of  health have greatly exceeded theirs. The climate of the South Sea  Islands, of South Africa, and of the West Indian Islands, is far more  favourable to European health than that of the parts of India in which  most of our missions are. The longevity of many of the South African  missionaries bears remarkable testimony to the salubrity of their  climate.    This failure of health and consequent abandonment of the work is one of  the greatest trials missions in India have had to encounter, and is a  formidable obstacle to success. Instances have not been rare when, after  great expense has been incurred, the missionary or his wife has suddenly  broken down--the wife perhaps more frequently than the husband--and a  speedy return to England has been the result. The name appears in the  Report as an agent, but no work has been, or could have been,  accomplished. In other cases the stay has been too brief to have  admitted of efficient service. A considerable time must elapse before  the missionary, however zealous and able, can acquire such an  acquaintance with the language and people as will enable him to do his  work in a satisfactory manner. When one has fully entered on the work,  there is frequent interruption from illness and weakness induced by the  severity of the climate. When I transfer myself in thought to my first  two years in Benares, and from my vivid remembrance of the vicissitudes  of our mission during these years look down through all the succeeding  years not only of our mission, but of other missions in Northern India  with which I am well acquainted, I am painfully struck with the bitter  disappointments of missionary Societies in the prosecution of their  work. They have responded to the urgent appeal for reinforcement, and in  not a few cases no sooner has the reinforcement been gained than it has  been lost. The Societies formed of late years for Zenana work have  suffered from this cause more than even the older Societies. They have  suffered in a degree which must have been very discouraging to their  managers and supporters. Happily a considerable number of all Societies  have been able to remain at their post, and some have remained so long  as to give an average length of missionary service, which hides the fact  of the extreme brevity of the period spent by many in the foreign field.    The question here suggests itself, Has this speedy abandonment of the  work been always necessary? Has there been the endurance demanded of  those who have professed themselves consecrated to a missionary life?  Has the return to England been accepted only when the compulsion of  circumstances left no alternative, and then accepted most reluctantly?  With every desire to think of others as favourably as possible, without  any breach of charity, it must be acknowledged there have been cases of  departure, where I think a more resolute spirit would have kept persons  at their post. This I trust holds true of only a few. I know some who  soon left to whom the abandonment of the work was a bitter trial.  Nothing but the thought that to remain would have been to fight against  Providence took them away. To go back to the cases of failure during my  early period at Benares, I may mention that the departure of Mr. and"]]]
