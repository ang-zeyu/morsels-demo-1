Jump into the car, my lad. Go along. People  will think you're a millionaire.\"    The man gulped, grinned sheepishly, opened the door and stepped in, and  sank with a sigh of comfort into the luxurious depths of the big brown  cushions.    \"Gawd! To think that there are men like you in the world, sir! Why, I  believe in angels, I do!\"    \"Nonsense Sam. Now you come along to my flat, and I'm going to give you a  good breakfast and start you fair again.\"    \"I'm going to try and keep straight, sir, I am s'help me!\"    It may be said in truth that Mr. Lyne did not care very much whether Sam  kept straight or not. He might indeed have been very much disappointed if  Sam had kept to the straight and narrow path. He \"kept\" Sam as men keep  chickens and prize cows, and he \"collected\" Sam as other men collect  stamps and china. Sam was his luxury and his pose. In his club he boasted  of his acquaintance with this representative of the criminal classes--for  Sam was an expert burglar and knew no other trade--and Sam's adoration  for him was one of his most exhilarating experiences.    And that adoration was genuine. Sam would have laid down his life for the  pale-faced man with the loose mouth. He would have suffered himself to be  torn limb from limb if in his agony he could have brought ease or  advancement to the man who, to him, was one with the gods.    Originally, Thornton Lyne had found Sam whilst that artist was engaged in  burgling the house of his future benefactor. It was a whim of Lyne's to  give the criminal a good breakfast and to evince an interest in his  future. Twice had Sam gone down for a short term, and once for a long  term of imprisonment, and on each occasion Thornton Lyne had made a  parade of collecting the returned wanderer, driving him home, giving him  breakfast and a great deal of worldly and unnecessary advice, and  launching him forth again upon the world with ten pounds--a sum just  sufficient to buy Sam a new kit of burglar's tools.    Never before had Sam shown such gratitude; and never before had Thornton  Lyne been less disinterested in his attentions. There was a hot  bath--which Sam Stay could have dispensed with, but which, out of sheer  politeness, he was compelled to accept, a warm and luxurious breakfast; a  new suit of clothes, with not two, but four, five-pound notes in the  pocket.    After breakfast, Lyne had his talk.    \"It's no good, sir,\" said the burglar, shaking his head. \"I've tried  everything to get an honest living, but somehow I can't get on in the  straight life. I drove a taxicab for three months after I came out, till  a busy-fellow[A] tumbled to me not having a license, and brought me up  under the Prevention of Crimes Act. It's no use my asking you to give me  a job in your shop, sir, because I couldn't stick it, I couldn't really!  I'm used to the open air life; I like being my own master. I'm one of  those fellows you've read about--the word begins with A.\"    [Footnote A: Detective.]    \"Adventurers?\" said Lyne with a little laugh. \"Yes, I think you are, Sam,  and I'm going to give you an adventure after your own heart.\"    And then he began to tell a tale of base ingratitude--of a girl he had  helped, had indeed saved from starvation and who had betrayed him at  every turn. Thornton Lyne was a poet. He was also a picturesque liar. The  lie came as easily as the truth, and easier, since there was a certain  crudeness about truth which revolted his artistic soul. And as the tale  was unfolded of Odette Rider's perfidy, Sam's eyes narrowed. There was  nothing too bad for such a creature as this. She was wholly undeserving  of sympathy.    Presently Thornton Lyne stopped, his eyes fixed on the other to note the  effect.    \"Show me,\" said Sam, his voice trembling. \"Show me a way of getting even  with her, sir, and I'll go through hell to do it!\"    \"That's the kind of stuff I like to hear,\" said Lyne, and poured out from  the long bottle which stood on the coffee-tray a stiff tot of Sam's  favourite brandy. \"Now, I'll give you my idea.\"    For the rest of the morning the two men sat almost head to head, plotting  woe for the girl, whose chief offence had been against the dignity of  Thornton Lyne, and whose virtue had incited the hate of that vicious man.          CHAPTER IV    MURDER      Jack Tarling lay stretched upon his hard bed, a long cigarette-holder  between his teeth, a book on Chinese metaphysics balanced on his chest,  at peace with the world. The hour was eight o'clock, and it was the day  that Sam Stay had been released from gaol.    It had been a busy day for Tarling, for he was engaged in a bank fraud  case which would have occupied the whole of his time had he not had a  little private business to attend to. This private matter was wholly  unprofitable, but his curiosity had been piqued.    He lay the book flat on his chest as the soft click of the opening door  announced the coming of his retainer. The impassive Ling Chu came  noiselessly into the room, carrying a tray, which he placed upon a low  table by the side of his master's bed. The Chinaman wore a blue silk  pyjama suit--a fact which Tarling noticed.    \"You are not going out to-night then, Ling Chu?\"    \"No, Lieh Jen,\" said the man.    They both spoke in the soft, sibilant patois of Shantung.    \"You have been to the Man with the Cunning Face?\"    For answer the other took an envelope from an inside pocket and laid it  in the other's hand. Tarling glanced at the address.    \"So this is where the young lady lives, eh? Miss Odette Rider, 27,  Carrymore Buildings, Edgware Road.\"    \"It is a clan house, where many people live,\" said Ling Chu. \"I myself  went, in your honourable service, and saw people coming in and going out  interminably, and never the same people did I see twice.\"    \"It is what they call in English a 'flat building,' Ling,\" said Tarling  with a little smile. \"What did the Man with the Cunning Face say to my  letter?\"    \"Master, he said nothing. He just read and read, and then he made a face  like this.\" Ling gave an imitation of Mr. Milburgh's smile. \"And then he  wrote as you see.\"    Tarling nodded. He stared for a moment into vacancy, then he turned on  his elbow and lifted the cup of tea which his servant had brought him.    \"What of Face-White-and-Weak Man, Ling?\" he asked in the vernacular. \"You  saw him?\"    \"I saw him, master,\" said the Chinaman gravely. \"He is a man without a  heaven.\"    Again Tarling nodded. The Chinese use the word \"heaven\" instead of \"God,\"  and he felt that Ling had very accurately sized up Mr. Thornton Lyne's  lack of spiritual qualities.    He finished the tea, and swung his legs over the edge of the bed.    \"Ling,\" he said, \"this place is very dull and sad. I do not think I shall  live here.\"    \"Will the master go back to Shanghai?\" asked the other, without any  display of emotion.    \"I think so,\" nodded Tarling. \"At any rate, this place is too dull. Just  miserable little taking-money-easily cases, and wife-husband-lover cases  and my soul is sick.\"    \"These are small matters,\" said Ling philosophically. \"But The  Master\"--this time he spoke of the great Master, Confucius--\"has said  that all greatness comes from small things, and perhaps some small-piece  man will cut off the head of some big-piece man, and then they will call  you to find the murderer.\"    Tarling laughed.    \"You're an optimist, Ling,\" he said. \"No, I don't think they'll call me  in for a murder. They don't call in private detectives in this country.\"    Ling shook his head.    \"But the master must find murderers, or he will no longer be Lieh Jen,  the Hunter of Men.\"    \"You're a bloodthirsty soul, Ling,\" said Tarling, this time in English,  which Ling imperfectly understood, despite the sustained efforts of  eminent missionary schools. \"Now I'll go out,\" he said with sudden  resolution. \"I am going to call upon the small-piece woman whom  White-Face desires.\"    \"May I come with you?\" asked Ling.    Tarling hesitated.    \"Yes, you may come,\" he said, \"but you must trail me.\"    Carrymore Mansions is a great block of buildings sandwiched between two  more aristocratic and more expensive blocks of flats in the Edgware Road.  The ground floor is given up to lock-up shops which perhaps cheapened the  building, but still it was a sufficiently exclusive habitation for the  rents, as Tarling guessed, to be a little too high for a shop assistant,  unless she were living with her family. The explanation, as he was to  discover, lay in the fact that there were some very undesirable basement  flats which were let at a lower rental.    He found himself standing outside the polished mahogany door of one of  these, wondering exactly what excuse he was going to give to the girl for  making a call so late at night. And that she needed some explanation was  clear from the frank suspicion which showed in her face when she opened  the door to him.    \"Yes, I am Miss Rider,\" she said.    \"Can I see you for a few moments?\"    \"I'm sorry,\" she said, shaking her head, \"but I am alone in the flat, so  I can't ask you to come in.\"    This was a bad beginning.    \"Is it not possible for you to come out?\" he asked anxiously, and in  spite of herself, she smiled.    \"I'm afraid it's quite impossible for me to go out with somebody I have  never met before,\" she said, with just a trace of amusement in her eyes.    \"I recognise the difficulty,\" laughed Tailing. \"Here is one of my cards.  I'm afraid I am not very famous in this country, so you will not know  my name.\"    She took the card and read it.    \"A private detective?\" she said in a troubled voice. \"Who has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20915"],[0,"Field's Chromatography (#4)"],[1," to a general rule, by which local colours closely connected  with black are first lost in the distance, and those nearly related to  white disappear last. The same may be said of local light and shade, the  latter of which is totally lost at great distances; and it is for this  reason the shadowed side of the moon is not generally seen. These powers  of colours are, however, varied by mist, air, altitude, and mixture,  which produce evanescence; and by contrast, which preserves the force of  colours by distinguishing them. Colours do not decline in force so much  by height as by horizontal distance, because the upper atmosphere is  less dense and clouded with vapour: and hence it is that mountains of  great elevation appear much nearer than they really are. From all these  circumstances, it is evident that a simple scumbling or uniform  degradation of local colours will not effect a true perspective--for  this will be the aërial of light and shade only--but such a  subordination of hues and tints, as the various powers of colours  require, and as is always observable in nature.    In furnishing or _setting the palette_ philosophically and upon  principle, it is necessary to supply it with pure blue, red, and yellow;  to oppose to these an orange, of a hue that will neutralise the  blue--green, of a hue that will neutralise the red--and purple, of a hue  that will neutralise the yellow; and so on to black and white, which  will neutralise each other. As in nature, the general colour of the sky  is blue, and the colour of light is always opposite to that of the sky  and shade, so the white which is to represent light should be tinged  with the orange of the palette sufficiently to neutralise the  predominant coldness of black. Pure neutral white may thus be reserved  as a \"local\" colour, which is a technical term for the _natural_ colour  of an object, unvaried by distance, reflection, or anything interfering  with distinct vision; although, properly speaking, local colours are  subject to all the relations and effects of the places they occupy in a  composition--whether of light, shade, reflection, or distance.    From what we have said, it will be seen that the relations and harmony  of colours form a complex subject, requiring constant and careful study;  one, indeed, into which he who would become a colourist must enter heart  and soul. For as colouring is the beginning and end of a painter's  craft, so colour in all its aspects must be the chief lesson of his  life. And this lesson can only be learnt, by ever watching with a loving  eye those wondrous colourings of nature, in which there is nothing  inharmonious or out of place.          PART II.           *       *       *       *       *    ON COLOURS AND PIGMENTS GENERALLY.          CHAPTER III.    ON CLASSES OF COLOURS.      By mixing his _colours with white_, the artist obtains his _tints_. By  mixing _colours with colours_, he produces compound colours, or _hues_.  And by mixing _colours or tints with black_, he gets _shades_. It is a  common error to confound these distinctions.    The above classification of colours enables us to understand the  simplicity of relation which exists among an infinity of tints, hues,  and shades of colour. Also, it is calculated to give precision to  language respecting colours, the nomenclature of which has too often  been vague and uncertain.    There are five classes of colours, viz.:--the _Neutral_, the _Primary_,  the _Secondary_, the _Tertiary_, and the _Semi-neutral_.    _Neutral Colours_ are three only, _white_, _black_, and grey. According  to the laws of Optics, the two first comprise all other colours  synthetically, and afford them all by analysis. These are sometimes  called \"extreme\" colours, grey being their intermediate.    _Primary Colours_ are three only, _yellow_, _red_, and _blue_. They are  such as yield others by being compounded, but are not themselves capable  of being produced by composition of other colours. By way of  distinction, they are occasionally designated \"entire\" colours.    _Secondary Colours_, are three only, _orange_, _green_, and _purple_.  Each of these is composed of, or can be resolved into, two primaries.  Thus, orange is composed of red and yellow; green, of yellow and blue;  and purple, of blue and red.    _Tertiary Colours_ are three only, _citrine_, _russet_, and _olive_.  Each of these is composed of, or can be resolved into, either two  secondary colours, or the three primaries. Thus, citrine consists of  green and orange, or of a predominant yellow with blue and red; russet  is compounded of orange and purple, or of a predominant red with blue  and yellow; and olive is composed of purple and green, or of a  predominant blue with yellow and red.    The last three genera of colours comprehend in an orderly gradation all  those which are _positive_ or definite; and the three colours of each  genus, united or compounded in such subordination that neither of them  predominates to the eye, constitute the _negative_ or neutral colours,  of which _black_ and _white_ have been stated to be the opposed  extremes, and _greys_ their intermediates. Thus black and white are  constituted of, and comprise latently, the principles of all colours,  and accompany them in their depth and brilliancy as shade and light.    _Semi-neutral Colours_ belong to a class of which _brown_, _marrone_,  and _gray_ may be considered types. They are so called, because they  comprehend all the combinations of the primary, secondary, and tertiary  colours, with the neutral _black_. Of the various combinations of black,  those in which yellow, orange, or citrine predominates, have obtained  the name of brown, &c. A second class in which the compounds of black  are of a predominant red, purple, or russet hue, comprises marrone,  chocolate, &c. And a third class, in which the combinations of black  have a predominating hue of blue, green, or olive, includes gray, slate,  &c.    While treating of the classes of colours, it may not be out of place to  note here the difference between gray as spelt with an _a_, and grey as  spelt with an _e_, the two names being occasionally confounded. _Gray_  is semi-neutral, and denotes a class of cool cinereous colours, faint of  hue; whence we have blue grays, olive grays, green grays, purple grays,  and grays of all hues in which blue predominates; but no yellow or red  grays, the predominance of such hues carrying the compounds into the  classes of brown and marrone, of which gray is the natural opposite.  _Grey_ is neutral, and is composed of or can be resolved into black and  white alone, from a mixture of which two colours it springs in an  infinite series.    It must be observed that each colour may comprehend an indefinite series  of _shades_ between the extremes of light and dark, as each compound  colour also may comprise a similar series of _hues_ between the extremes  of the colours composing it. And as the relations of colours have been  deduced regularly, from white or light to black or shade; so the same  may be done, inversely, from black to white. On this plan the  tertiaries, olive, russet, and citrine, take the place of the primaries,  blue, red, and yellow; while the secondaries still retain their  intermediate station and relation to both.    Thus, _russet and olive_ compose or unite in _dark purple_; _citrine and  olive_ in _dark green_; _russet and citrine_ in _dark orange_. The  tertiaries have, therefore, the same order of relation to black that the  primaries have to white; and we have black primaries, secondaries, and  tertiaries, inversely, as we have white primaries, secondaries, and  tertiaries, directly. In other words, we have light and dark colours in  all classes.          CHAPTER IV.    ON THE DURABILITY AND EVANESCENCE OF PIGMENTS.      Pigments may be defined as colours in a solid or insoluble state,  prepared for the artists' use. Hitherto, we have treated of colours in  the abstract sense, as appealing to the eye only: we have now to  consider them as material bodies.    As colour itself is relative, so is durability of colour relative. For  the reason that all material substances are changeable and in perpetual  action and reaction, no pigment is so permanent as that nothing will  alter its colour. On the other hand, none is so fugitive as not to last  under some favouring circumstances. Time, of long or short continuance,  has often the effect of fire, more or less intense. Indeed, it is some  sort of criterion of the stability and changes of colour in pigments,  that time and fire are apt to produce similar effects thereon. Thus, if  fire deepen, or cool, or warm a colour, so may time; if it vary its  hues, so may time; if it destroy a colour altogether, so may time  ultimately. The power of time, however, varies extremely with regard to  the period in which it produces those effects, that are instantly  accomplished by fire.    That there is no absolute but only relative durability of colour may be  proved from the most celebrated pigments. For instance, the colour of  native ultramarine, which will endure a hundred centuries under ordinary  circumstances, may be at once destroyed by a drop of lemon juice; and  the generally fugitive and changeable carmine of cochineal will, when  secluded from light and air, continue fifty years or more; while fire or  time, which merely deepen the former colour, will completely dissipate  the latter. Again, there have been works of art in which the white of  lead has retained its freshness for ages in a pure atmosphere, but has  been changed to blackness after a few days' or even hours' exposure to  foul air. These and other peculiarities of colours will be noticed, when  we come to speak of pigments individually; not for the purpose of  destroying the artist's confidence, but as a caution, and a guide to the  availing himself of their powers properly.    It is, therefore, the lasting under"]]]
