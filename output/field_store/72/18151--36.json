Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify one's mind, that  is the teaching of (all) the Awakened.    184. The Awakened call patience the highest penance, long-suffering the  highest Nirvana; for he is not an anchorite (pravragita) who strikes  others, he is not an ascetic (sramana) who insults others.    185. Not to blame, not to strike, to live restrained under the law,  to be moderate in eating, to sleep and sit alone, and to dwell on the  highest thoughts,--this is the teaching of the Awakened.    186. There is no satisfying lusts, even by a shower of gold pieces; he  who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain, he is wise;    187. Even in heavenly pleasures he finds no satisfaction, the disciple  who is fully awakened delights only in the destruction of all desires.    188. Men, driven by fear, go to many a refuge, to mountains and forests,  to groves and sacred trees.    189. But that is not a safe refuge, that is not the best refuge; a man  is not delivered from all pains after having gone to that refuge.    190. He who takes refuge with Buddha, the Law, and the Church; he who,  with clear understanding, sees the four holy truths:--    191. Viz. pain, the origin of pain, the destruction of pain, and the  eightfold holy way that leads to the quieting of pain;--    192. That is the safe refuge, that is the best refuge; having gone to  that refuge, a man is delivered from all pain.    193. A supernatural person (a Buddha) is not easily found, he is not  born everywhere. Wherever such a sage is born, that race prospers.    194. Happy is the arising of the awakened, happy is the teaching of the  True Law, happy is peace in the church, happy is the devotion of those  who are at peace.    195, 196. He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the  awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host  (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to  such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be  measured by anybody.          Chapter XV. Happiness    197. Let us live happily then, not hating those who hate us! among men  who hate us let us dwell free from hatred!    198. Let us live happily then, free from ailments among the ailing!  among men who are ailing let us dwell free from ailments!    199. Let us live happily then, free from greed among the greedy! among  men who are greedy let us dwell free from greed!    200. Let us live happily then, though we call nothing our own! We shall  be like the bright gods, feeding on happiness!    201. Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who has  given up both victory and defeat, he, the contented, is happy.    202. There is no fire like passion; there is no losing throw like  hatred; there is no pain like this body; there is no happiness higher  than rest.    203. Hunger is the worst of diseases, the body the greatest of pains; if  one knows this truly, that is Nirvana, the highest happiness.    204. Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the best riches;  trust is the best of relationships, Nirvana the highest happiness.    205. He who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and tranquillity,  is free from fear and free from sin, while he tastes the sweetness of  drinking in the law.    206. The sight of the elect (Arya) is good, to live with them is always  happiness; if a man does not see fools, he will be truly happy.    207. He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long way; company  with fools, as with an enemy, is always painful; company with the wise  is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk.    208. Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the  learned, the much enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one ought to follow  a good and wise man, as the moon follows the path of the stars.          Chapter XVI. Pleasure    209. He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to  meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure,  will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation.    210. Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is unpleasant.  Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see what is  unpleasant.    211. Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil.  Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no fetters.    212. From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is free  from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.    213. From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear; he who is  free from affection knows neither grief nor fear.    214. From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from  lust knows neither grief nor fear.    215. From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who is free from  love knows neither grief nor fear.    216. From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free from  greed knows neither grief nor fear.    217. He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the  truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear.    218. He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvana) has sprung up, who  is satisfied in his mind, and whose thoughts are not bewildered by love,  he is called urdhvamsrotas (carried upwards by the stream).    219. Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long away,  and returns safe from afar.    220. In like manner his good works receive him who has done good, and  has gone from this world to the other;--as kinsmen receive a friend on  his return.          Chapter XVII. Anger    221. Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome all  bondage! No sufferings befall the man who is not attached to name and  form, and who calls nothing his own.    222. He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a  real driver; other people are but holding the reins.    223. Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil by good;  let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by truth!    224. Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for  little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.    225. The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body,  they will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvana), where, if they have  gone, they will suffer no more.    226. Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who  strive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an end.    227. This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not only of to-day: `They  blame him who sits silent, they blame him who speaks much, they also  blame him who says little; there is no one on earth who is not blamed.'    228. There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who  is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.    229, 230. But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day  after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who  would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river?  Even the gods praise him, he is praised even by Brahman.    231. Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave the sins of the  body, and with thy body practise virtue!    232. Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave  the sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy tongue!    233. Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy mind! Leave the  sins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind!    234. The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise  who control their mind, are indeed well controlled.          Chapter XVIII. Impurity    235. Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have  come near to thee; thou standest at the door of thy departure, and thou  hast no provision for thy journey.    236. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities  are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the  heavenly world of the elect (Ariya).    237. Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama),  there is no resting-place for thee on the road, and thou hast no  provision for thy journey.    238. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are  blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into  birth and decay.    239. Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith  blows off the impurities of silver one by one, little by little, and  from time to time.    240. As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from  it, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead him to the evil  path.    241. The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses,  non-repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a watchman,  thoughtlessness.    242. Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the taint of a  benefactor; tainted are all evil ways in this world and in the next.    243. But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is  the greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and become  taintless!    244. Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a  mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.    245. But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for  what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent.    246. He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in this world takes  what is not given him, who goes to another man's wife;    247. And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he,  even in this world, digs up his own root.    248. O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take  care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a long  time!    249.

It is  octagonal in plan, and possesses a fine groined roof. It is now attached  to the deanery, and known as the dean's kitchen.    We must now turn our attention to the erection of the present central  tower. The belfry added by Hugh de Derlington was in 1429 struck by  lightning and set on fire. It must after this have been repaired in some  way, but in 1456 it was in a very unsafe and dangerous condition, as the  following letter written by the prior, William Ebchester, to Bishop  Neville testifies:--        \"The Belfry of your church, both in its masonry and timber, in      consequence of winds and storms is so enfeebled and shaken, that      doubts are entertained of its standing for any length of time. We      have called in workmen in both capacities, and they have reported to      us that three of its sides are out of perpendicular, that many of      the Key and cornerstones of its windows have fallen out, that in      other respects it is defective, and that besides, its woodwork is in      a state of great decay so that it cannot be expected to stand for      any length of time. Some are of opinion that the belfry should be      totally removed as it cannot stand longer; others on the contrary,      wish it to be perfectly restored; a thing which exceeds our means,      unless we have the advantage of charitable aid. In this state of      doubt and hesitation, we have recourse to you, as members to their      head, presuming not to engage in any such great and stupendous      alteration with reference to your church, without your advice.        \"If, which God forbid, the tower should fall, the solemn fabric of      our choir, and the shrine of our most holy patron, would without      doubt, be broken down and irrevocably laid flat on the ground, for      that is the direction in which it leans. We confess that whenever      winds and storms are high, and we are standing at our duty in that      part of the church we tremble for our fate, having positive danger      before our eyes.\"    Shortly afterwards, the rebuilding of all the upper part of the central  tower was commenced and continued for some years. It was not complete in  1474 when Richard Bell was prior, as in a letter written at the time he  mentions the \"reedificacion of our steeple, begun but nogt fynyshed, in  defaulte of goods, as God knoweth.\" It is therefore most probable that  the upper portion was not completed until towards the close of the  fifteenth century.    We have now reached a period when the glories of Gothic architecture  were fading, during which many of our finest churches suffered  considerably. Durham is no exception to the rule, and we find during the  next two centuries a long record of destruction and so-called  improvement. This, perhaps, reached its worst stage during the time of  Wyatt, who in 1796 pulled down the magnificent Norman chapter-house.  During the last decade, however, this has been completely rebuilt from  as nearly as possible the original design. Wyatt also rebuilt the  turrets on the eastern transept or Nine Altar Chapel from his own  design, and removed the great Early English rose window in the east end  and replaced it by the present one. The original stained glass was taken  out of all the windows of the east end, and Raine, in his history, tells  us that it \"lay for a long time afterwards in baskets upon the floor,  and when the greater part of it had been purloined, the remainder was  locked up in the Galilee.... At a still later period, about fifteen  years ago, portions of it were placed in the great round window, and the  rest still remains unappropriated.\" This was written in 1833. It is also  on record that Wyatt formed a scheme to re-open the great western  doorway of the cathedral by the pulling down of the Galilee Chapel, from  which he intended constructing a carriage-drive to the castle. This  abomination was actually commenced when Dean Cornwallis arrived, and he,  with the assistance of John Carter, and the Society of Antiquaries, was  fortunately able to put a stop to it. Thus was this beautiful and unique  specimen of Transitional Norman architecture preserved to us.    Wyatt contemplated several other \"improvements\" of a similar character,  one of which was the surmounting of the central tower by a spire, but  fortunately he was not allowed to carry them out.    During the present century many restorations have been made, of which we  will mention only the most notable:--The central tower was restored by  Sir Gilbert Scott in 1859.    During 1870 to 1876 extensive internal alterations were made. A new  choir screen and pulpit were erected, the floor of the choir laid in  marble mosaic, the choir stalls returned to their original positions,  and the walls of the church scraped in order to clear them from the many  coats of lime and distemper which lay on them.    [Illustration: The West End (from an Old Print).]    The Norman chapter-house has lately been restored and in great part  rebuilt as a memorial to the late Bishop Lightfoot.          [Illustration: The Exterior, From Palace Green.]    CHAPTER II    DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERIOR      Approaching the Cathedral Church of Durham from the north by the large  open space between it and the Castle, known as the Palace Green, we  obtain a complete elevation of the whole structure. There is little room  to doubt, though the details naturally vary with the date of erection,  that the original plan of Carileph's church has been carried out in its  entirety, with two exceptions. These are the addition of the eastern  transept or nine altar chapel at the east, and the Galilee or Lady  Chapel at the west end. The entire length of the building, not including  the Galilee chapel, is 431 feet, which is made up as follows:--Nine  altar chapel 51 feet, the choir 120 feet, the transept 57 feet, and the  nave 203 feet.    The #Western Towers# are square and solid, and were evidently  included in Carileph's own scheme, as the wall arcades on both the  interior and exterior are carried round them. The Norman work is  continued as far as the nave roof, and it is extremely probable that  they were originally terminated at this height, in accordance with the  Norman custom, with low pyramidal spires, probably of wood. Exactly at  what date they were raised is not on record, but the style of  architecture of the upper portion suggests the early part of the  thirteenth century. The added portion, namely that above the  clerestory, consists of four stages, and is beautifully varied by  moulded arcading, with blind and open arches. The first and third stages  have pointed arches, while those of the second and fourth are round.  Above this again were tall wooden spires covered with lead. These were  removed about the year 1657, and towards the close of the eighteenth  century the present pinnacles and open parapets were added. At this  time, also, much of the surface of the towers was renewed.    The #Central Tower.#--The present central tower is noble in  proportion, and forms a fitting and harmonious summit to the whole  group. It must needs be of a very different character from the old  Norman tower, of which no trace now remains; and was most probably of  the usual type, low and square, and surmounted by a short pyramidal  spire. The existing structure may be attributed to Bishop Booth and  Prior Richard Bell, about 1474, when the letter previously quoted was  written. Externally the tower is divided into two storeys. The lower  portion contains, on each side, a pair of two-light windows, glazed,  each divided by a transom, and their heads having an ogee label  crocketed and finished with a tall finial also crocketed. Between and on  either side of these windows are panelled pilasters and brackets  carrying figures. The lower and upper stages are divided by a narrow  external gallery running round the tower, and protected by a pierced,  embattled parapet. This is known as the Bell Ringers' Gallery, and  certainly adds greatly to the effect of the tower as a whole. The upper  stage, which is much less lofty, has also two two-light windows on each  face, surmounted by crocketed ogee label mouldings and finials. These  lights are louvred. The whole is surmounted by a deep open-work parapet.  On each angle of the tower are two buttresses, which are decorated with  panelling and canopied and crocketed niches containing figures. The  interior of the tower or lantern is remarkable for the gallery which  runs round it, which is reached from the roofs of the nave and choir  transepts by doors. It rests on corbels, each alternate one being carved  with grotesque heads, and is protected by a parapet pierced in  quatrefoils. The four doorways are ogee-headed, with crockets and  finials. There is strong evidence in the construction of the present  tower that it was the original intention to surmount it by some other  erection, probably a spire. Each interior angle contains strong and  massive squinches which are of no constructive use at present, and must  have been originally inserted to carry some superstructure. The  buttresses at the angles are also carried up to the parapet, which would  seem to point to the same conclusion. Why this project was never carried  out cannot be said, but probably it would not have added to the artistic  effect of the tower. The belfry contains a peal of eight bells.    [Illustration: The Central Tower.]    The #East Front.#--The circumstances which led to the removal of  Carileph's apses and the erection of the eastern transept have  already been referred to. The present east end is divided into three  bays by massive buttresses, each of which contains three lofty lancet  windows separated by smaller buttresses. Over all, and in the gable, is  the famous large rose window. The north and south ends of the transept  are finished with the tall pyramidal pinnacles erected by Wyatt.    The #West Front# of"]]]
