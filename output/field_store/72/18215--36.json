He was a venerable man, and       although only a fellow of a college, was more ecclesiastically got       up than many a dean, or even here and there, perhaps, a bishop of       the present less costumed if more ritualistic period. Mr. Simeon, I       believe, recommended Mr. Jones, an excellent specimen of the       excellent evangelical school of those days. We went to Leicester to       hear him preach in a large church, and his text was '_Grow in       grace_.' He became eventually archdeacon of Liverpool, and died in       great honour a few years ago at much past 90. On the strength of       this visit to Cambridge I lately boasted there, even during the       lifetime of the aged Provost Okes, that I had been in the       university before any one of them.         I think it was at this time that in London we were domiciled in       Russell Square, in the house of a brother of my mother, Mr. Colin       Robertson; and I was vexed and put about by being forbidden to run       freely at my own will into and about the streets, as I had done in       Liverpool. But the main event was this: we went to a great service       of public thanksgiving at Saint Paul's, and sat in a small gallery       annexed to the choir, just over the place where was the Regent, and       looking down upon him from behind. I recollect nothing more of the       service, nor was I ever present at any public thanksgiving after       this in Saint Paul's, until the service held in that cathedral,       under my advice as the prime minister, after the highly dangerous       illness of the Prince of Wales.         Before quitting the subject of early recollections I must name one       which involves another person of some note. My mother took me in       181--to Barley Wood Cottage, near Bristol. Here lived Miss Hannah       More, with some of her coeval sisters. I am sure they loved my       mother, who was love-worthy indeed. And I cannot help here       deviating for a moment into the later portion of the story to       record that in 1833 I had the honour of breakfasting with Mr.       Wilberforce a few days before his death,[6] and when I entered the       house, immediately after the salutation, he said to me in his       silvery tones, 'How is your sweet mother?' He had been a guest in       my father's house some twelve years before. During the afternoon       visit at Barley Wood, Miss Hannah More took me aside and presented       to me a little book. It was a copy of her _Sacred Dramas_, and it       now remains in my possession, with my name written in it by her.       She very graciously accompanied it with a little speech, of which I       cannot recollect the conclusion (or apodosis), but it began, 'As       you have just come into the world, and I am just going out of it, I       therefore,' etc.        I wish that in reviewing my childhood I could regard it as      presenting those features of innocence and beauty which I have often      seen elsewhere, and indeed, thanks be to God, within the limits of      my own home. The best I can say for it is that I do not think it was      a vicious childhood. I do not think, trying to look at the past      impartially, that I had a strong natural propensity then developed      to what are termed the mortal sins. But truth obliges me to record      this against myself. I have no recollection of being a loving or a      winning child; or an earnest or diligent or knowledge-loving child.      God forgive me. And what pains and shames me most of all is to      remember that at most and at best I was, like the sailor in Juvenal,                                digitis a morte remotus,                       Quatuor aut septem;[7]        the plank between me and all the sins was so very thin. I do not      indeed intend in these notes to give a history of the inner life,      which I think has been with me extraordinarily dubious, vacillating,      and above all complex. I reserve them, perhaps, for a more private      and personal document; and I may in this way relieve myself from      some at least of the risks of falling into an odious Pharisaism. I      cannot in truth have been an interesting child, and the only      presumption the other way which I can gather from my review is that      there was probably something in me worth the seeing, or my father      and mother would not so much have singled me out to be taken with      them on their journeys.        I was not a devotional child. I have no recollection of early love      for the House of God and for divine service: though after my father      built the church at Seaforth in 1815, I remember cherishing a hope      that he would bequeath it to me, and that I might live in it. I have      a very early recollection of hearing preaching in St. George's,      Liverpool, but it is this: that I turned quickly to my mother and      said, 'When will he have done?' The _Pilgrim's Progress_ undoubtedly      took a great and fascinating hold upon me, so that anything which I      wrote was insensibly moulded in its style; but it was by the force      of the allegory addressing itself to the fancy, and was very like a      strong impression received from the _Arabian Nights_, and from      another work called _Tales of the Genii_. I think it was about the      same time that Miss Porter's _Scottish Chiefs_, and especially the      life and death of Wallace, used to make me weep profusely. This      would be when I was about ten years old. At a much earlier period,      say six or seven, I remember praying earnestly, but it was for no      higher object than to be spared from the loss of a tooth. Here,      however, it may be mentioned in mitigation that the local dentist      of those days, in our case a certain Dr. P. of ---- Street,      Liverpool, was a kind of savage at his work (possibly a very      good-natured man too), with no ideas except to smash and crash. My      religious recollections, then, are a sad blank. Neither was I a      popular boy, though not egregiously otherwise. If I was not a bad      boy, I think that I was a boy with a great absence of goodness. I      was a child of slow, in some points I think of singularly slow,      development. There was more in me perhaps than in the average boy,      but it required greatly more time to set itself in order: and just      so in adult, and in middle and later life, I acquired very tardily      any knowledge of the world, and that simultaneous conspectus of the      relations of persons and things which is necessary for the proper      performance of duties in the world.        I may mention another matter in extenuation. I received, unless my      memory deceives me, very little benefit from teaching. My father was      too much occupied, my mother's health was broken. We, the four      brothers, had no quarrelling among ourselves: but neither can I      recollect any influence flowing down at this time upon me, the      junior. One odd incident seems to show that I was meek, which I      should not have supposed, not less than thrifty and penurious, a      leaning which lay deep, I think, in my nature, and which has      required effort and battle to control it. It was this. By some      process not easy to explain I had, when I was _probably_ seven or      eight, and my elder brothers from ten or eleven to fourteen or      thereabouts, accumulated no less than twenty shillings in silver. My      brothers judged it right to appropriate this fund, and I do not      recollect either annoyance or resistance or complaint. But I      recollect that they employed the principal part of it in the      purchase of four knives, and that they broke the points from the      tops of the blades of my knife, lest I should cut my fingers.        Where was the official or appointed teacher all this time? He was      the Rev. Mr. Rawson of Cambridge, who had, I suppose, been passed by      Mr. Simeon and become private tutor in my father's house. But as he      was to be incumbent of the church, the bishop required a parsonage      and that he should live in it. Out of this grew a very small school      of about twelve boys, to which I went, with some senior brother or      brothers remaining for a while.         Mr. Rawson was a good man, of high no-popery opinions. His school       afterwards rose into considerable repute, and it had Dean Stanley       and the sons of one or more other Cheshire families for pupils. But       I think this was not so much due to its intellectual stamina as to       the extreme salubrity of the situation on the pure dry sands of the       Mersey's mouth, with all the advantages of the strong tidal action       and the fresh and frequent north-west winds. At five miles from       Liverpool Exchange, the sands, delicious for riding, were one       absolute solitude, and only one house looked down on them between       us and the town. To return to Mr. Rawson. Everything was       unobjectionable. I suppose I learnt something there. But I have no       recollection of being under any moral or personal influence       whatever, and I doubt whether the preaching had any adaptation       whatever to children. As to intellectual training, I believe that,       like the other boys, I shirked my work as much as I could. I went       to Eton in 1821 after a pretty long spell, in a very middling state       of preparation, and wholly without any knowledge or other       enthusiasm, unless it were a priggish love of argument which I had       begun to develop. I had lived upon a rabbit warren: and what a       rabbit warren of a life it is that I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21102"],[0,"Tom and Some Other Girls: A Public School Story (#4)"],[1," Fraulein, but his pages were still stiff and  unread; Longfellow opened of himself at \"Hiawatha\"; while Tennyson, most  beloved of all, held half a dozen markers at favourite passages.  His  portrait hung close at hand, a copy of that wonderful portrait by Watts,  which seems to have immortalised all the power and beauty of the  strange, sad face.  Rhoda nicked a grain of dust from the glass surface,  and carefully straightened the frame against the wall, for this picture  was one of her greatest treasures, and respected accordingly.  Another  case held books of stories, ranging from the fairy tales of childhood to  the publications of last year; a third was devoted to bound volumes of  magazines, and a fourth to the less showy and interesting school-books.    \"It's no use taking _you_!\" said Rhoda scornfully.  \"I expect you are  quite out of date.  You can stay here and rest, and when I come back  I'll point out your errors, and send you into the lumber-room to make  room for the new ones!\"  Then she turned her attention to the  mantelpiece, on which reposed a quite extraordinary number of miniature  jugs.  Jugs, jugs everywhere, and nothing but jugs; blue jugs, yellow  jugs, brown jugs, red jugs; Worcester jugs with delicate white figures  against a background of blue; jugs worth a penny sterling at the village  emporium; plain jugs, iridescent jugs; jugs with one handle, with two,  with three, with none at all.  Their variety was as puzzling as their  number, but Rhoda gazed at them with all the pride of the collector.  \"Jugs\"--unrivalled by postcards, stamps, or crests--had been her mania  for a year on end, and the result was dear to her heart.  To find a new  jug to add to the collection had appeared one of the chief objects in  travelling; an expedition to town had been a failure or success,  according as it discovered jugs or no jugs.    In her anxiety for their safety she had even volunteered to dust her own  mantelpiece, and now, alas! she must leave them to the tender mercies of  Mary and her assistants!  It was a painful reflection, and after a  moment's consideration she determined not to risk it, but to store the  darlings away in some safe hiding-place until her return.    No sooner said than done.  Each little jug was wrapped in a separate  roll of tissue paper, fitted into a drawer of the writing-table, and  securely locked against invasion.  The process of \"putting away\" thus  begun extended itself indefinitely.  The photographs in their various  frames must be arranged and divided; nice relations and very dearest  friends, to be taken to school, disagreeable or \"middling\" relations,  and merely \"dearest friends,\" to be laid aside in another drawer;  fragile ornaments to be hidden, in case they were broken; silver and  brass in case they tarnished; letters to be destroyed, to be tied up in  packets, to be answered before leaving home; pieces of fancy work to be  folded away, in case sacrilegious hands should dare to put them to any  other use than that for which they were intended.    Rhoda set to work with the energy of ten women, and worked away until  the once tidy room had become a scene of wildest confusion; until sofa,  table, and chairs were alike piled high with bundles.  Then of a sudden  her energy flagged, she grew tired and discouraged, and wished she had  left the stupid old things where she had found them.  It occurred to her  as a brilliant inspiration that there was no possible hurry, and that  sitting under the trees reading a book, and drinking lemon squash, was a  much more agreeable method of spending a hot summer's day than working  like a charwoman.  She carried her latest book into the garden  forthwith, ordered the \"squash,\" and spent an hour of contented idleness  before lunch.    The story, however, was not interesting enough to tempt a second reading  during the afternoon, for the heroine was a girl of unimpeachable  character, who pursued her studies at home under the charge of a daily  governess, and such a poor-spirited creature could hardly be expected to  commend herself to a girl who had decided for two whole days to go to  the newest of all new schools, and already felt herself far removed from  such narrow experiences.  Rhoda cast about in her mind for the next  diversion, and decided to bicycle across the park to call upon the  Vicar's daughter the self-same Ella Mason who had been her informant on  so many important points.  Ella would be indeed overcome to hear that  Rhoda herself was to be a \"Hurst\" girl, and there would be an increased  interest in hearing afresh those odd pieces of information which had  fallen from the cousin's lips.    She felt a thrill of relief on hearing that her friend was at home, and  in finding her alone in the morning-room, which looked so bare and  colourless to eyes accustomed to the splendours of the Chase.  Something  of the same contrast existed between the two girls themselves, for while  Rhoda sat glowing pink and white after her ride, Ella's cheeks were as  pale as her dress, and her eyes almost as colourless as the washed-out  ribbon round her waist.  She was not a beauty by any means, but  unaffectedly loving and unselfish, rejoicing in her friend's news,  though it would deprive her of a favourite companion, and she was all  anxiety to help and encourage.  She knitted her brow to remember all  that the cousin had said of Hurst Manor, wishing only that she had  listened with more attention to those pearls of wisdom.    \"Yes, she said that they did a great deal of Latin.  All the girls learn  it, and it seems to be looked on as one of the most important subjects.  They translate Horace and Livy and all kinds of learned books.\"    \"Humph!  I shan't!\" declared Rhoda coolly.  \"I don't approve of Latin  for girls.  It's silly.  Of course, if you intend to teach, or be a  doctor, or anything like that, it may be useful, but for ordinary stop-  at-home girls it's nonsense.  What use would Latin be to _me_, I should  like to know?  I shall take modern languages instead.  I can read and  write French fluently, though it doesn't come quite so easy to speak it,  and German, of course, is second nature after jabbering with Fraulein  all these years.  I should _think_ in German if I would allow myself,  but I won't.  I don't think it is patriotic.  There is not very much  that any one can teach me of French or German!\"    \"Then what is the use of studying them any more?\" inquired Ella, aptly  enough; but Rhoda was not a whit discomposed.    \"My dear, it is ever so much pleasanter doing things that you  understand!  The first stages are such a grind.  Well, what next?  What  other subjects are important?\"    \"Mathematics.  Some of the girls are awfully clever, and are ever so far  on in Euclid.  I did one book with father; but it worried me so, and I  cried so much one day when he altered the letters and put the whole  thing out, that he grew tired, and said I could give it up.  You didn't  do any with Fraulein, I think?\"    \"No; it's a nuisance.  I wish I did now; but I'll have to begin at once,  that's all!  I'll get Harold's old books and cram up before I go, so  that I can just bring in an expression now and then, as if I knew all  about it.  Girls are so patronising if they think you are a beginner...  I'm pretty well up in history, and can say reams of poetry, and play,  and draw, and paint in water colours--\"    \"Ye-es!\" assented Ella feebly.  She was afraid to say so much in words,  but her conviction was that her friend's methods of work would seem  strangely antiquated when contrasted with the vivid strength of the new  _regime_.  She recalled Rhoda's mild copies of village scenes, with  cottages in the foreground, trees to the rear, and a well-regulated  flight of swallows on the sky line, and mentally placed them beside her  cousin's vigorous sketches on the Slade system, where two or three lines  seemed to do the work of a dozen, and prettiness was a thing abhorred!  She remembered the lessons in theory and harmony, and trembled for her  friend's awakening.  \"Yes,\" she repeated.  \"Oh, of course; and then  there are other things besides lessons--a girl can make herself popular  by being pleasant and obliging, and the outdoor life is so fascinating.  Games every day, just as if you were boys, and each one trying to get  into a higher team, and as keen and enthusiastic as she can be.  You  _will_ enjoy the games, Rhoda!\"    \"Now that's just one thing I wanted to talk to you about!\" cried Rhoda  earnestly.  \"I'm glad you reminded me.  Of course, tennis and croquet  are all right.  I can play a _very_ good set, and beat most ladies at  croquet.  One time this summer I made five hoops in one turn, and took  my partner with me, but of course I don't do that _every_ day of the  week.  I'm all right for summer games, but winter is coming on, and I  shall have to play that horrid old hockey, and I haven't the remotest  idea how it is done.  I've never seen a match, but you have, and I want  you to tell me all about it, so that I may know what to do, and not make  an idiot of myself.  You went to the Betham ground when you were staying  there, and saw the girls' team play.  Go on!  Describe it!  Tell me all  about it, and everything they did!\"    Ella drew a deep breath, and looked awed and important.    \"Well! it was a county match, and one team wore white blouses and the  other pink.  They had on blue skirts, very short, and awful feet!  Some  had great pads on each ankle, and some had leggings, and some had  nothing at all.  I should have swathings of cotton wool a foot wide, for  it made my ankles ache just to see the sticks swinging about!  It was an  icy day; the wind went through us like knives and scissors, and we stood  on little planks of wood and shuddered, with furs up to our ears, but  they wore no hats or jackets, and their sleeves went flap, flap, as thin  as possible.  There was only one pretty one among them,"]]]
