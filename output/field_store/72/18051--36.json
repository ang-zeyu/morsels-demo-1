It was penetrating,  and a little more of it would have been suffocating. And as a leaden  gray bank of broken clouds rolled up the wind grew stronger and the air  colder. Chilled before, Carley now became thoroughly cold.    There appeared to be no end to the devastated forest land, and the  farther she rode the more barren and sordid grew the landscape. Carley  forgot about the impressive mountains behind her. And as the ride wore  into hours, such was her discomfort and disillusion that she forgot  about Glenn Kilbourne. She did not reach the point of regretting her  adventure, but she grew mightily unhappy. Now and then she espied  dilapidated log cabins and surroundings even more squalid than the  ruined forest. What wretched abodes! Could it be possible that people  had lived in them? She imagined men had but hardly women and children.  Somewhere she had forgotten an idea that women and children were  extremely scarce in the West.    Straggling bits of forest--yellow pines, the driver called the  trees--began to encroach upon the burned-over and arid barren land. To  Carley these groves, by reason of contrast and proof of what once was,  only rendered the landscape more forlorn and dreary. Why had these miles  and miles of forest been cut? By money grubbers, she supposed, the same  as were devastating the Adirondacks. Presently, when the driver had to  halt to repair or adjust something wrong with the harness, Carley was  grateful for a respite from cold inaction. She got out and walked. Sleet  began to fall, and when she resumed her seat in the vehicle she asked  the driver for the blanket to cover her. The smell of this horse blanket  was less endurable than the cold. Carley huddled down into a state of  apathetic misery. Already she had enough of the West.    But the sleet storm passed, the clouds broke, the sun shone through,  greatly mitigating her discomfort. By and by the road led into a section  of real forest, unspoiled in any degree. Carley saw large gray squirrels  with tufted ears and white bushy tails. Presently the driver pointed  out a flock of huge birds, which Carley, on second glance, recognized  as turkeys, only these were sleek and glossy, with flecks of bronze and  black and white, quite different from turkeys back East. \"There must be  a farm near,\" said Carley, gazing about.    \"No, ma'am. Them's wild turkeys,\" replied the driver, \"an' shore the  best eatin' you ever had in your life.\"    A little while afterwards, as they were emerging from the woodland  into more denuded country, he pointed out to Carley a herd of gray  white-rumped animals that she took to be sheep.    \"An' them's antelope,\" he said. \"Once this desert was overrun by  antelope. Then they nearly disappeared. An' now they're increasin'  again.\"    More barren country, more bad weather, and especially an exceedingly  rough road reduced Carley to her former state of dejection. The jolting  over roots and rocks and ruts was worse than uncomfortable. She had to  hold on to the seat to keep from being thrown out. The horses did not  appreciably change their gait for rough sections of the road. Then a  more severe jolt brought Carley's knee in violent contact with an iron  bolt on the forward seat, and it hurt her so acutely that she had to  bite her lips to keep from screaming. A smoother stretch of road did not  come any too soon for her.    It led into forest again. And Carley soon became aware that they had at  last left the cut and burned-over district of timberland behind. A cold  wind moaned through the treetops and set the drops of water pattering  down upon her. It lashed her wet face. Carley closed her eyes and sagged  in her seat, mostly oblivious to the passing scenery. \"The girls will  never believe this of me,\" she soliloquized. And indeed she was amazed  at herself. Then thought of Glenn strengthened her. It did not really  matter what she suffered on the way to him. Only she was disgusted at  her lack of stamina, and her appalling sensitiveness to discomfort.    \"Wal, hyar's Oak Creek Canyon,\" called the driver.    Carley, rousing out of her weary preoccupation, opened her eyes to see  that the driver had halted at a turn of the road, where apparently it  descended a fearful declivity.    The very forest-fringed earth seemed to have opened into a deep abyss,  ribbed by red rock walls and choked by steep mats of green timber. The  chasm was a V-shaped split and so deep that looking downward sent at  once a chill and a shudder over Carley. At that point it appeared narrow  and ended in a box. In the other direction, it widened and deepened,  and stretched farther on between tremendous walls of red, and split its  winding floor of green with glimpses of a gleaming creek, bowlder-strewn  and ridged by white rapids. A low mellow roar of rushing waters floated  up to Carley's ears. What a wild, lonely, terrible place! Could Glenn  possibly live down there in that ragged rent in the earth? It frightened  her--the sheer sudden plunge of it from the heights. Far down the gorge  a purple light shone on the forested floor. And on the moment the sun  burst through the clouds and sent a golden blaze down into the depths,  transforming them incalculably. The great cliffs turned gold, the creek  changed to glancing silver, the green of trees vividly freshened, and  in the clefts rays of sunlight burned into the blue shadows. Carley had  never gazed upon a scene like this. Hostile and prejudiced, she yet  felt wrung from her an acknowledgment of beauty and grandeur. But wild,  violent, savage! Not livable! This insulated rift in the crust of the  earth was a gigantic burrow for beasts, perhaps for outlawed men--not  for a civilized person--not for Glenn Kilbourne.    \"Don't be scart, ma'am,\" spoke up the driver. \"It's safe if you're  careful. An' I've druv this manys the time.\"    Carley's heartbeats thumped at her side, rather denying her taunted  assurance of fearlessness. Then the rickety vehicle started down at an  angle that forced her to cling to her seat.        CHAPTER II    Carley, clutching her support, with abated breath and prickling skin,  gazed in fascinated suspense over the rim of the gorge. Sometimes the  wheels on that side of the vehicle passed within a few inches of the  edge. The brakes squeaked, the wheels slid; and she could hear the  scrape of the iron-shod hoofs of the horses as they held back stiff  legged, obedient to the wary call of the driver.    The first hundred yards of that steep road cut out of the cliff appeared  to be the worst. It began to widen, with descents less precipitous. Tips  of trees rose level with her gaze, obstructing sight of the blue depths.  Then brush appeared on each side of the road. Gradually Carley's strain  relaxed, and also the muscular contraction by which she had braced  herself in the seat. The horses began to trot again. The wheels rattled.  The road wound around abrupt corners, and soon the green and red wall of  the opposite side of the canyon loomed close. Low roar of running water  rose to Carley's ears. When at length she looked out instead of down she  could see nothing but a mass of green foliage crossed by tree trunks  and branches of brown and gray. Then the vehicle bowled under dark  cool shade, into a tunnel with mossy wet cliff on one side, and  close-standing trees on the other.    \"Reckon we're all right now, onless we meet somebody comin' up,\"  declared the driver.    Carley relaxed. She drew a deep breath of relief. She had her first  faint intimation that perhaps her extensive experience of motor cars,  express trains, transatlantic liners, and even a little of airplanes,  did not range over the whole of adventurous life. She was likely to meet  something, entirely new and striking out here in the West.    The murmur of falling water sounded closer. Presently Carley saw that  the road turned at the notch in the canyon, and crossed a clear swift  stream. Here were huge mossy boulders, and red walls covered by lichens,  and the air appeared dim and moist, and full of mellow, hollow roar.  Beyond this crossing the road descended the west side of the canyon,  drawing away and higher from the creek. Huge trees, the like of which  Carley had never seen, began to stand majestically up out of the gorge,  dwarfing the maples and white-spotted sycamores. The driver called these  great trees yellow pines.    At last the road led down from the steep slope to the floor of the  canyon. What from far above had appeared only a green timber-choked  cleft proved from close relation to be a wide winding valley, tip and  down, densely forested for the most part, yet having open glades and  bisected from wall to wall by the creek. Every quarter of a mile or so  the road crossed the stream; and at these fords Carley again held on  desperately and gazed out dubiously, for the creek was deep, swift, and  full of bowlders. Neither driver nor horses appeared to mind obstacles.  Carley was splashed and jolted not inconsiderably. They passed through  groves of oak trees, from which the creek manifestly derived its name;  and under gleaming walls, cold, wet, gloomy, and silent; and between  lines of solemn wide-spreading pines. Carley saw deep, still green  pools eddying under huge massed jumble of cliffs, and stretches of white  water, and then, high above the treetops, a wild line of canyon rim,  cold against the sky. She felt shut in from the world, lost in an  unscalable rut of the earth. Again the sunlight had failed, and the gray  gloom of the canyon oppressed her. It struck Carley as singular that she  could not help being affected by mere weather, mere heights and depths,  mere rock walls and pine trees, and rushing water. For really, what  had these to do with her? These were only physical things that she was  passing. Nevertheless, although she resisted sensation, she was more and  more shot through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18818"],[0,"On the Evolution of Language (#4)"],[1,"with it a  great variety of particles, which can be arranged in three general  classes, _i.e._, pronominal, adverbial, and prepositional.    The pronominal particles we have called article pronouns; they serve  to point out a variety of characteristics in the subject, object, and  indirect object of the verb. They thus subserve purposes which in  English are subserved by differentiated adjectives as distinct parts of  speech. They might, therefore, with some propriety, have been called  adjective particles, but these elements perform another function; they  serve the purpose which is usually called _agreement in language_; that  is, they make the verb agree with the subject and object, and thus  indicate the syntactic relation between subject, object, and verb.  In this sense they might with propriety have been called relation  particles, and doubtless this function was in mind when some of the  older grammarians called them transitions.    The adverbial particles perform the functions of voice, mode, and tense,  together with many other functions that are performed in languages  spoken by more highly civilized people by differentiated adverbs,  adverbial phrases, and clauses.    The prepositional particles perform the function of indicating a great  variety of subordinate relations, like the prepositions used as distinct  parts of speech in English.    By the demonstrative function of some of the pronominal particles, they  are closely related to adverbial particles, and adverbial particles are  closely related to prepositional particles, so that it will be sometimes  difficult to say of a particular particle whether it be pronominal or  adverbial, and of another particular particle whether it be adverbial or  prepositional.    Thus the three classes of particles are not separated by absolute planes  of demarkation.    The use of these particles as parts of the verb; the use of nouns,  adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions as intransitive verbs; and the  direct use of verbs as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, make the study  of an Indian tongue to a large extent the study of its verbs.    To the extent that voice, mode, and tense are accomplished by the use of  agglutinated particles or inflections, to that extent adverbs and verbs  are undifferentiated.    To the extent that adverbs are found as incorporated particles in verbs,  the two parts of speech are undifferentiated.    To the extent that prepositions are particles incorporated in the verb,  prepositions and verbs are undifferentiated.    To the extent that prepositions are affixed to nouns, prepositions and  nouns are undifferentiated.    In all these particulars it is seen that the Indian tongues belong to  a very low type of organization. Various scholars have called attention  to this feature by describing Indian languages as being holophrastic,  polysynthetic, or synthetic. The term synthetic is perhaps the best,  and may be used as synonymous with undifferentiated.    Indian tongues, therefore, may be said to be highly synthetic in that  their parts of speech are imperfectly differentiated.    In these same particulars the English language is highly organized, as  the parts of speech are highly differentiated. Yet the difference is one  of degree, not of kind.    To the extent in the English language that inflection is used for  qualification, as for person, number, and gender of the noun and  pronoun, and for mode and tense in the verb, to that extent the parts of  speech are undifferentiated. But we have seen that inflection is used  for this purpose to a very slight extent.    There is yet in the English language one important differentiation which  has been but partially accomplished. Verbs as usually considered are  undifferentiated parts of speech; they are nouns and adjectives, one or  both, and predicants. The predicant simple is a distinct part of speech.  The English language has but one, the verb _to be_, and this is not  always a pure predicant, for it sometimes contains within itself an  adverbial element when it is conjugated for mode and tense, and a  connective element when it is conjugated for agreement. With adjectives  and nouns this verb is used as a predicant. In the passive voice also it  is thus used, and the participles are nouns or adjectives. In what is  sometimes called the progressive form of the active voice nouns and  adjectives are differentiated in the participles, and the verb \"to be\"  is used as a predicant. But in what is usually denominated the active  voice of the verb, the English language has undifferentiated parts of  speech. An examination of the history of the verb _to be_ in the English  language exhibits the fact that it is coming more and more to be used as  the predicant; and what is usually called the common form of the active  voice is coming more and more to be limited in its use to special  significations.    The real active voice, indicative mode, present tense, first person,  singular number, of the verb to eat, is _am eating_. The expression  _I eat_, signifies _I am accustomed to eat_. So, if we consider the  common form of the active voice throughout its entire conjugation,  we discover that many of its forms are limited to special uses.    Throughout the conjugation of the verb the auxiliaries are predicants,  but these auxiliaries, to the extent that they are modified for mode,  tense, number, and person, contain adverbial and connective elements.    In like manner many of the lexical elements of the English language  contain more than one part of speech: _To ascend_ is _to go up_;  _to descend_ is _to go down_; and _to depart_ is _to go from_.    Thus it is seen that the English language is also synthetic in that its  parts of speech are not completely differentiated. The English, then,  differs in this respect from an Indian language only in degree.    In most Indian tongues no pure predicant has been differentiated, but  in some the verb _to be_, or predicant, has been slightly developed,  chiefly to affirm, existence in a place.    It will thus be seen that by the criterion of organization Indian  tongues are of very low grade.    It need but to be affirmed that by the criterion of sematologic  content Indian languages are of a very low grade. Therefore the  frequently-expressed opinion that the languages of barbaric peoples  have a more highly organized grammatic structure than the languages of  civilized peoples has its complete refutation.    It is worthy of remark that all paradigmatic inflection in a civilized  tongue is a relic of its barbaric condition. When the parts of speech  are fully differentiated and the process of placement fully specialized,  so that the order of words in sentences has its full significance, no  useful purpose is subserved by inflection.    Economy in speech is the force by which its development has been  accomplished, and it divides itself properly into economy of utterance  and economy of thought. Economy of utterance has had to do with the  phonic constitution of words; economy of thought has developed the  sentence.    All paradigmatic inflection requires unnecessary thought. In the clause  _if he was here_, _if_ fully expresses the subjunctive condition, and it  is quite unnecessary to express it a second time by using another form  of the verb _to be_. And so the people who are using the English  language are deciding, for the subjunctive form is rapidly becoming  obsolete with the long list of paradigmatic forms which have  disappeared.    Every time the pronoun _he_, _she_, or _it_ is used it is necessary to  think of the sex of its antecedent, though in its use there is no reason  why sex should be expressed, say, one time in ten thousand. If one  pronoun non-expressive of gender were used instead of the three,  with three gender adjectives, then in nine thousand nine hundred and  ninety-nine cases the speaker would be relieved of the necessity of  an unnecessary thought, and in the one case an adjective would fully  express it. But when these inflections are greatly multiplied, as they  are in the Indian languages, alike with the Greek and Latin, the speaker  is compelled in the choice of a word to express his idea to think of a  multiplicity of things which have no connection with that which he  wishes to express.    A _Ponka_ Indian, in saying that a man killed a rabbit, would have  to say the man, he, one, animate, standing, in the nominative case,  purposely killed, by shooting an arrow, the rabbit, he, the one,  animate, sitting, in the objective case; for the form of a verb to kill  would have to be selected, and the verb changes its form by inflection  and incorporated particles to denote person, number, and gender as  animate or inanimate, and gender as standing, sitting, or lying, and  case; and the form of the verb would also express whether the killing  was done accidentally or purposely, and whether it was by shooting or by  some other process, and, if by shooting, whether by bow and arrow, or  with a gun; and the form of the verb would in like manner have to  express all of these things relating to the object; that is, the person,  number, gender, and case of the object; and from the multiplicity of  paradigmatic forms of the verb to kill this particular one would have to  be selected. Perhaps one time in a million it would be the purpose to  express all of these particulars, and in that case the Indian would have  the whole expression in one compact word, but in the nine hundred and  ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine cases all of these  particulars would have to be thought of in the selection of the form of  the verb, when no valuable purpose would be accomplished thereby.    In the development of the English, as well as the French and German,  linguistic evolution has not been in vain.    Judged by these criteria, the English stands alone in the highest rank;  but as a written language, in the way"]]]
