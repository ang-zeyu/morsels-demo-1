Vol. 1 (of 2) (#4)"],[1," twenty years after, and the period of the most happy  Monarch in the world: _Quis talia fando!_'    In the closing days of 1640 Evelyn lost his father, when he abandoned  the study of the law and betook himself abroad in preference to being  mixed up in the disorders of the time. His resolutions were 'to absent  myselfe from this ill face of things at home, which gave umbrage to  wiser than myselfe, that the medaill was reversing, and our calamities  but yet in their infancy.' Shortly before that he had 'beheld on Tower  Hill the fatal stroake which sever'd the wisest head in England from the  shoulders of the Earl of Strafford.'    Landing at Flushing in July, 1641, Evelyn passed, accompanied by his  tutor Mr. Caryll, through Midelbrogh, Der Veer, Dort, Rotterdam, and  Delft, to the Hague, where he presented himself to the Queen of  Bohemia's Court. Thence he went on to Leyden, Utrecht, Rynen, and  Nimeguen, to where the Dutch army was encamped about Genep, a strong  fortress on the Wahale river. Here he enrolled himself and served for a  few days as a volunteer in the Queen's army 'according to the  compliment,' being attached to the English company of Captain Apsley:  and in this capacity he 'received many civilities.' Even when thus  playing at soldering, he did not like the roughness of a soldier's life,  'for the sun piercing the canvass of the tent, it was, during the day,  unsufferable, and at night not seldom infested with mists and fogs,  which ascended from the river.' However, during the few days he took his  fair share in the work. 'As the turn came about, I watched on a horne  work neere our quarters, and trailed a pike, being the next morning  relieved by a company of French. This was our continual duty till the  Castle was re-fortified, and all danger of quitting that station  secured.' Retracing his steps to Rotterdam, Delft, the Hague and Leyden,  he also visited Haerlem, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brussels and various other  towns before returning by way of Ostend, Dunkirk and Dover to Wotton,  where he celebrated his 21st birthday.    Although his _Diary_ does not contain any details on such matters as  Pepys would have been free to record in his cipher, John Evelyn was  probably rather a gay and pleasure-loving youth about this time. A  suspicion of this seems justified by the fact that he 'was elected one  of the Comptrolers of the Middle Temple-revellers, as the fashion of ye  young Students and Gentlemen was, the Christmas being kept this year  (1641) with great solemnity; but being desirous to passe it in the  Country, I got leave to resign my staffe of office, and went with my  brother Richard to Wotton.' From January till March he was back in  London 'studying a little, but dancing and fooling more.'      III    _Evelyn's Early Manhood, Continental Travels and Studies, Voluntary  Exile, and Return to England 1647._    It was hardly possible that anyone situated as Evelyn was could hold  aloof from the party strife when civil war broke out during the course  of this year. And, of course, he was on the Royalist side. But he did  not serve long with the troops. Here is his own record of that military  service,--'Oct. 3rd. To Chichester, and hence the next day to see the  siege of Portsmouth; for now was that bloody difference betweene the  King and Parliament broken out, which ended in the fatal tragedy so many  years after. It was on the day of its being render'd to Sir William  Waller, which gave me an opportunity of taking my leave of Colonel  Goring the Governor, now embarqueing for France. This day was fought  that signal Battaile at Edgehill. Thence I went to Southampton and  Winchester, where I visited the Castle, Schole, Church, and King  Arthur's Round Table, but especially the Church, and its Saxon Kings'  Monuments, which I esteemed a worthy antiquity. 12th. November, was the  Battle of Braineford surprisingly fought, and to the greate  consternation of the Citty had his Majesty (as twas believed he would)  pursu'd his advantage. I came in with my horse and armes just at the  retreate, but was not permitted to stay longer than the 15th. by reason  of the Army's marching to Glocester, which would have left both me and  my brother expos'd to ruine, without any advantage to his Majestie. Dec.  7th. I went from Wotton to London to see the so much celebrated line of  com'unication, and on the 10th. returned to Wotton, nobody knowing of my  having been in his Majestie's Army.'    During the first half of 1643 Evelyn employed himself entirely in rural  occupations, visiting the garden and vineyard of Hatfield and similar  places. From time to time, however, he made many journeys to and from  London. What he sometimes saw there gave him much food for ample  reflection. 'May 2nd. I went from Wotton to London, where I saw the  furious and zelous people demolish that stately Crosse in Cheapside. On  the 4th. I returned with no little regrett for the confusion that  threatened us. Resolving to possess myself in some quiet if it might be,  in a time of so great jealosy, I built by my Brother's permission a  study, made a fishpond, an island, and some other solitudes and  retirements, at Wotton, which gave the first occasion of improving them  to those water-works and gardens which afterwards succeeded them, and  became at that tyme the most famous of England.' But, willy nilly, he  was bound to become dragged into action on the King's behalf. 'July  12th. I sent my black manege horse and furniture with a friend to his  Majestie then at Oxford. 23rd. The Covenant being pressed, I absented  myselfe; but finding it impossible to evade the doing very unhandsome  things, and which had been a greate cause of my perpetual motions  hitherto between Wotton and London, Oct. 2nd. I obtayned a lycence of  his Majestie, dated at Oxford and sign'd by the King, to travell  againe.' Accordingly, on 7th. November, he took boat at the Tower wharf  for Sittingbourne, 'being only a payre of oares, expos'd to a hideous  storm, thence posting to Dover accompanied by an Oxford friend, Mr.  Thicknesse, and crossing the Channel to Calais.'    Proceeding by Boulogne, Monstreuil, Abbeville, Beauvais, Beaumont, and  St. Denys to Paris, of which he gives a very interesting account, he  threw himself into the social life of that gay capital. His first step  was to make his duty to Sir Richard Browne, afterwards his  father-in-law, then in charge of British affairs pending the arrival of  the Earl of Norwich, who came immediately after that as Ambassador  Extraordinary. That Evelyn's purse was fairly well lined the Parisian  passages in his _Diary_ distinctly show. He appears to have taken part  in many gay excursions and junkettings, though he sometimes reckoned the  cost. 'At an inn in this village (St. Germains en Lay) is an host who  treats all the greate persons in princely lodgings for furniture and  plate, but they pay well for it, as I have don. Indeede the  entertainment is very splendid, and not unreasonable, considering the  excellent manner of dressing their meate, and of the service. Here are  many debauches and excessive revellings, as being out of all noise and  observance.' Wherever he visited the royal gardens and villas, or those  of the great nobles and other magnates, he writes rapturously of what he  saw. Sometimes, though, his joyous optimism rather leads one to doubt  the quality of his taste, as when, writing of Richelieu's villa at  Ruell, he says 'This leads to the Citroniere, which is a noble conserve  of all those rarities; and at the end of it is the Arch of Constantine,  painted on a wall in oyle, as large as the real one at Rome, so well don  that even a man skilled in painting may mistake it for stone and  sculpture. The skie and hills which seem to be between the arches are so  naturall that swallows and other birds, thinking to fly through, have  dashed themselves against the wall. I was infinitely taken with this  agreeable cheate.' But he was certainly gradually acquiring the  materials which were afterwards to be so well used by him in his great  works on gardening. After a tour made in Normandy with Sir John Cotton,  a Cambridgeshire knight, he quitted Paris in April, 1644. Marching  across by Chartres and Estamps to Orleans, the party of which he formed  one had an encounter with brigands, 'for no sooner were we entred two or  three leagues into ye Forest of Orleans (which extends itself many  miles), but the company behind us were set on by rogues, who, shooting  from ye hedges and frequent covert, slew fowre upon the spot... I had  greate cause to give God thankes for this escape.' Taking boat, he went  down the Loire to St. Dieu, and thence rode to Blois and on to Tours,  where he stayed till the autumn. 'Here I took a master of the language  and studied the tongue very diligently, recreating myself sometimes at  the maill, and sometymes about the towne.' Here, too, he paid his duty  to the Queen of England, 'having newly arrived, and going for Paris.' In  the latter part of September, still accompanied by his friend  Thicknesse, he left Tours and 'travelled towards the more southerne part  of France, minding now to shape my course so as I might winter in  Italy.' Journeying southward, partly by road and partly by river, he  visited Lyons, Avignon, and Marseilles, whither he wended his way  deliciously 'thro' a country sweetely declining to the South and  Mediterranean coasts, full of vineyards and olive-yards, orange-trees,  myrtils, pomegranads, and the like sweete plantations, to which belong  pleasantly-situated villas ...... as if they were so many heapes of snow  dropp'd out of the clouds amongst these perennial greenes.' Taking mules  to Cannes, he went by sea to Genoa 'having procur'd a bill of health  (without which there is no admission at any towne in Italy).' On  reaching 'Mongus, now cal'd Monaco' on the route, 'we were hastened  away, having no time permitted us by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2078"],[0,"Thais (#4)"],[1,"all these advantages; you lose without  hope of any gain; you give without hope of any return, and you imitate  foolishly the noble deeds of us anchorites, as an impudent monkey  thinks, by smearing a wall, to copy the picture of a clever artist.  What, then, are your reasons, O most besotted of men?\"    Paphnutius spoke with violence and indignation, but the old man remained  unmoved.    \"Friend,\" he replied, gently, \"what matter the reasons of a dog sleeping  in the dirt or a mischievous ape?\"    Paphnutius' only aim was the glory of God. His anger vanished, and he  apologised with noble humility.    \"Pardon me, old man, my brother,\" he said, \"if zeal for the truth has  carried me beyond proper bounds. God is my witness, that it is thy  errors and not thyself that I hate. I suffer to see thee in darkness,  for I love thee in Jesus Christ, and care for thy salvation fills my  heart. Speak! give me your reasons. I long to know them that I may  refute them.\"    The old man replied quietly--    \"It is the same to me whether I speak or remain silent. I will give my  reasons without asking yours in return, for I have no interest in you  at all. I care neither for your happiness nor your misfortune, and it  matters not to me whether you think one way or another. Why should I  love you, or hate you? Aversion and sympathy are equally unworthy of the  wise man. But since you question me, know then that I am named Timocles,  and that I was born at Cos, of parents made rich by commerce. My father  was a shipowner. In intelligence he much resembled Alexander, who is  surnamed the Great. But he was not so gross. In short, he was a man of  no great parts. I had two brothers, who, like him, were shipowners. As  for me, I followed wisdom. My eldest brother was compelled by my father  to marry a Carian woman, named Timaessa, who displeased him so greatly  that he could not live with her without falling into a deep melancholy.  However, Timaessa inspired our younger brother with a criminal passion,  and this passion soon turned to a furious madness. The Carian woman  hated them both equally; but she loved a flute-player, and received him  at night in her chamber. One morning he left there the wreath which he  usually wore at feasts. My two brothers, having found this wreath, swore  to kill the flute-player, and the next day they caused him to perish  under the lash, in spite of his tears and prayers. My sister-in-law  felt such grief that she lost her reason, and these three poor wretches  became beasts rather than human beings, and wandered insane along the  shores of Cos, howling like wolves and foaming at the mouth, and hooted  at by the children, who threw shells and stones at them. They died, and  my father buried them with his own hands. A little later his stomach  refused all nourishment, and he died of hunger, though he was rich  enough to have bought all the meats and fruits in the markets of Asia.  He was deeply grieved at having to leave me his fortune. I used it in  travels. I visited Italy, Greece, and Africa without meeting a single  person who was either wise or happy. I studied philosophy at Athens and  Alexandria, and was deafened by noisy arguments. At last I wandered as  far as India, and I saw on the banks of the Ganges a naked man, who had  sat there motionless with his legs crossed for more than thirty years.  Climbing plants twined round his dried up body, and the birds built  their nests in his hair. Yet he lived. At the sight of him I called to  mind Timaessa, the flute-player, my two brothers, and my father, and  I realised that this Indian was a wise man. 'Men,' I said to myself,  'suffer because they are deprived of that which they believe to be good;  or because, possessing it they fear to lose it; or because they endure  that which they believe to be an evil. Put an end to all beliefs of this  kind, and the evils would disappear.' That is why I resolved henceforth  to deem nothing an advantage, to tear myself entirely from the good  things of this world, and to live silent and motionless, like the  Indian.\"    Paphnutius had listened attentively to the old man's story.    \"Timocles of Cos,\" he replied, \"I own that your discourse is not wholly  devoid of sense. It is, in truth, wise to despise the riches of this  world. But it would be absurd to despise also your eternal welfare, and  render yourself liable to be visited by the wrath of God. I grieve at  your ignorance, Timocles, and I will instruct you in the truth, in order  that knowing that there really exists a God in three hypostases, you may  obey this God as a child obeys its father.\"    Timocles interrupted him.    \"Refrain, stranger, from showing me your doctrines, and do not imagine  that you will persuade me to share your opinions. All discussions are  useless. My opinion is to have no opinion. My life is devoid of trouble  because I have no preferences. Go thy ways, and strive not to withdraw  me from the beneficent apathy in which I am plunged, as though in a  delicious bath, after the hardships of my past days.\"    Paphnutius was profoundly instructed in all things relating to the  faith. By his knowledge of the human heart, he was aware that the grace  of God had not fallen on old Timocles, and the day of salvation for this  soul so obstinately resolved to ruin itself had not yet come. He did not  reply, lest the power given for edification should turn to destruction.  For it sometimes happens, in disputing with infidels, that the means  used for their conversion may steep them still farther in sin. Therefore  they who possess the truth should take care how they spread it.    \"Farewell, then, unhappy Timocles,\" he said; and heaving a deep sigh, he  resumed his pious pilgrimage through the night.    In the morning, he saw the ibises motionless on one leg at the edge of  the water, which reflected their pale pink necks. The willows stretched  their soft grey foliage to the bank, cranes flew in a triangle in the  clear sky, and the cry of unseen herons was heard from the sedges. Far  as the eye could reach, the river rolled its broad green waters o'er  which white sails, like the wings of birds, glided, and here and there  on the shores, a white house shone out. A light mist floated along the  banks, and from out the shadow of the islands, which were laden  with palms, flowers, and fruits, came noisy flocks of ducks, geese,  flamingoes, and teal. To the left, the grassy valley extended to the  desert its fields and orchards in joyful abundance; the sun shone on  the yellow wheat, and the earth exhaled forth its fecundity in odorous  wafts. At this sight, Paphnutius fell on his knees, and cried--    \"Blessed be the Lord, who has given a happy issue to my journey. O God,  who spreadest Thy dew upon the fig trees of the Arsiniote, pour Thy  grace upon Thais, whom Thou hast formed with Thy love, as Thou hast the  flowers and trees of the field. May she, by Thy loving care, flourish  like a sweet-scented rose in the heavenly Jerusalem.\"    And every time that he saw a tree covered with blossom, or a bird of  brilliant plumage, he thought of Thais. Keeping along the left arm of  the river and through a fertile and populous district, he reached, in  a few days, the city of Alexandria, which the Greeks have surnamed the  Beautiful and the Golden. The sun had risen an hour, when he beheld,  from the top of a hill, the vast city, the roofs of which glittered in  the rosy light. He stopped, and folded his arms on his breast.    \"There, then,\" he said, \"is the delightful spot where I was born in sin;  the bright air where I breathed poisonous perfumes; the sea of pleasure  where I heard the songs of the sirens. There is my cradle, after the  flesh; my native land--in the parlance of the men of these days! A rich  cradle, an illustrious country, in the judgment of men! It is natural  that thy children should reverence thee like a mother, Alexandria, and  I was begotten in thy magnificently adorned breast. But the ascetic  despises nature, the mystic scorns appearances, the Christian regards  his native land as a place of exile, the monk is not of this earth. I  have turned away my heart from loving thee, Alexandria. I hate thee! I  hate thee for thy riches, thy science, thy pleasures, and thy beauty. Be  accursed, temple of demons! Lewd couch of the Gentiles, tainted pulpit  of Arian heresy, be thou accursed! And thou, winged son of heaven who  led the holy hermit Anthony, our father, when he came from the depths of  the desert, and entered into the citadel of idolatry to strengthen the  faith of believers and the confidence of martyrs, beautiful angel of  the Lord, invisible child, first breath of God, fly thou before me, and  cleanse, by the beating of thy wings, the corrupted air I am about to  breathe amongst the princes of darkness of this world!\"    Having thus spoken, he resumed his journey. He entered the city by the  Gate of the Sun. This gate was a handsome structure of stone. In the  shadow of its arch, crowded some poor wretches, who offered lemons  and figs for sale, or with many groans and lamentations, begged for an  obolus.    An old woman in rags, who was kneeling there, seized the monk's cassock,  kissed it, and said--    \"Man of the Lord, bless me, that God may bless me. I have suffered many  things in this world that I may have joys in the world to come. You  come from God, O holy man, and that is why the dust of your feet is more  precious than gold.\"    \"The Lord be praised!\" said Paphnutius, and with his half-closed hand he  made the sign of redemption on the old woman's head.    But hardly had he gone twenty paces down the street, than a band of  children began to jeer at him, and throw stones, crying--    \"Oh, the wicked monk! He is blacker than an ape, and more bearded than  a goat! He is a skulker! Why not hang him in an orchard, like a wooden  Priapus, to frighten the birds? But no; he would draw down the hail on"]]]
