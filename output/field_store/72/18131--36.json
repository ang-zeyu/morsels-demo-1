Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the  king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,  Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star  in the east, and are come to worship him.    When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all  Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and  scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ  should be born.    And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written  by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the  least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a  Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.    Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them  diligently what time the star appeared.    And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for  the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that  I may come and worship him also.    When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which  they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over  where the young child was.    When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.    And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with  Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had  opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and  frankincense, and myrrh.    _The White Christmas._    As the three wise men rode on that first Christmas night to find the  manger-cradled Babe of Bethlehem, they bore gifts on their  saddle-bows. Gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. And so the spirit  of Christmas giving crept into the world's heart. We bring our gifts  to the children. Rich children, poor children! The children of the  high and the children of the humble! Poor little sick children--and  the ragged children of the slums of our cities. Let us remember them  all.    So go ye, all of ye, into the highways and byways, and seek out the  poor and the distressed, the humble and the afflicted, seek out the  ragged children and the outcasts and the aged ones, and in the name of  Him who was born on Christmas day, carry some sunshine into their  hearts! Give unto the poor and the afflicted, and your hearts shall  glow with that inward peace that passeth all understanding.    Then--and then only--will you be able to sing with all the company of  Heaven, Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, good will toward  men! And this will be your pure white Christmas. (_Exit_ PROLOGUE _at  L._)    _Soft chimes are heard. The curtains are drawn, disclosing the same  scene as before._ DEBORAH _sits before her inn, deep in thought._    DEBORAH (_reading a scroll_).    This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give  you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall  call his name Immanuel.    Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and  choose the good.    For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the  good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her  kings.    _Enter_ GASPAR _from behind the inn. He comes down center._    GASPAR.       I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite,       If any wonders you have seen this night?    DEBORAH (_rises_).       I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light       Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.    GASPAR.       Tell me, for thou art native of this place,       What dost thou know about the King of Grace--       King of the Jews?    DEBORAH.       Aye, in Jerusalem       He dwells, and not in Bethlehem.       He sits upon his mighty judgment throne,       Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.    GASPAR.       I mean a new-born King, of love and peace;       His is the star--His reign shall never cease.    DEBORAH.       All things tonight seem passing strange to me,       I have just read an ancient prophecy       That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town,       Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown,       Of one called Councillor of King David's line       Whose coming is foretold in words divine.       And now you come with words of mystery!    (_Muses._)         Why should thy questions, which are dark to me,       Cause me to think of Him?    GASPAR.       The star! The star!       No more it moves about the heavens afar,       It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray,       For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!    (_Hurries out right._)    DEBORAH.       His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within       And seek protection in my humble inn.    (_Exits right front._)    _After a short pause_, MELCHOIR, GASPAR _and_ BALTASAR _enter from  rear right._    MELCHOIR.         Three kings came riding from far away,         Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar;       Three wise men out of the east were they,       And they traveled by night and they slept by day,         For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.    BALTASAR.         The star was so beautiful, large and clear,         That all other stars of the sky       Became a white mist in the atmosphere;       And by this they knew that the coming was near         Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.    GASPAR.         Of the child that is born, O Baltasar,         I begged a woman to tell us the news;       I said in the east we had seen His star,       And had ridden fast and had ridden far         To find and worship the King of the Jews.         --_Adapted from Longfellow._    MELCHOIR.       Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star       Is standing still over this lowly hut.    BALTASAR.       Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!    GASPAR (_knocks on the door of the manger_).       What ho, within!    JOSEPH _enters from the L. rear._    JOSEPH.       Sirs, whom seek ye?    MELCHOIR.       We have journeyed from afar       Led by the shining of yon splendid star.       We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.    BALTASAR.       We seek a new-born King,       Gold, frankincense to him we bring.       And many a kingly offering.    JOSEPH _draws back the curtain and reveals the interior of the  manger._ MARY _is seen bending over the crib. The_ SHEPHERDS _are  kneeling in the background. Very soft music heard in the distance,  with faintly chiming bells at intervals._    GASPAR.       Behold, the child is clothed in light!    MELCHOIR.       Our journey ends, passed is the night.    BALTASAR.       Now let us make no more delay,       But worship Him right worthily.    (_They enter the manger and kneel._)    SIMEON.       Hail, hail, dear child       Of a maiden meek and mild.         See, he merries!       See, he smiles, my sweeting,       I give thee greeting!           Have a bob of cherries.    (_Places a spray of cherries on the crib._)    TIMOTHY.       Hail, little One we've sought,       See, a bird I've brought,           See its feathers gay.       Hail, little One adored,       Hail, blessed King and Lord,           Star of the day!    (_Places a bird on the crib._)    ISAAC.       Hail, little One, so dear,       My heart is full of cheer,           A little ball I bring,       Reach forth thy fingers gay,       And take the ball and play,           My blessed King.    (_Places a ball on the crib._)    _Enter all others from the Inn. They kneel outside the manger._    ALL (_sing, with concealed choir_).         CHRISTMAS CAROL.         (_See page 169_)         Christ was born on Christmas day,       Wreathe the holly, twine the bay,       Light and life and joy is He--           The Babe, the Son,           The Holy One             Of Mary.         He is born to set us free;       He is born our Lord to be;       Carol, Christians, joyfully;           The God, the Lord,           By all adored             Forever.         Let the bright red berries glow,       Everywhere in goodly show,       Life and light and joy is He,           The Babe, the Son,           The Holy One             Of Mary.         Christian men, rejoice and sing;       'Tis the birthday of our King,       Carol, Christians, joyfully;           The God, the Lord,           By all adored             Forever.    THE THREE KINGS.       Hail, King of Kings!    GASPAR.       I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings,       And here a scepter full of gems,       For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.    (_Places crown and scepter on crib._)    MELCHOIR.       For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!    (_He swings a smoking censor._)    BALTASAR.       And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!    (_Places casket on the crib._)    GASPAR.       The greatest gift is yet ungiven,       The gift that cometh straight from Heaven.           O, Heavenly King,           Heart's love we bring.    MELCHOIR.       Not gold nor gems from land or sea       Is worth the love we offer Thee.    BALTASAR.       And lowly folk who have no gold,       Nor gift to offer that is meet,       May bring the dearest thing of all--       A loving heart and service sweet.

A duty to my countrymen; to the memory of those who died in defense of a  cause consecrated by inheritance, as well as sustained by conviction;  and to those who, perhaps less fortunate, staked all, and lost all, save  life and honor, in its behalf, has impelled me to attempt the  vindication of their cause and conduct. For this purpose I have decided  to present an historical sketch of the events which preceded and  attended the struggle of the Southern States to maintain their existence  and their rights as sovereign communities--the creators, not the  creatures, of the General Government.    The social problem of maintaining the just relation between  constitution, government, and people, has been found so difficult, that  human history is a record of unsuccessful efforts to establish it. A  government, to afford the needful protection and exercise proper care  for the welfare of a people, must have homogeneity in its constituents.  It is this necessity which has divided the human race into separate  nations, and finally has defeated the grandest efforts which conquerors  have made to give unlimited extent to their domain. When our fathers  dissolved their connection with Great Britain, by declaring themselves  free and independent States, they constituted thirteen separate  communities, and were careful to assert and preserve, each for itself,  its sovereignty and jurisdiction.    At a time when the minds of men are straying far from the lessons our  fathers taught, it seems proper and well to recur to the original  principles on which the system of government they devised was founded.  The eternal truths which they announced, the rights which they declared  \"_unalienable_,\" are the foundation-stones on which rests the  vindication of the Confederate cause.    He must have been a careless reader of our political history who has not  observed that, whether under the style of \"United Colonies\" or \"United  States,\" which was adopted after the Declaration of Independence,  whether under the articles of Confederation or the compact of Union,  there everywhere appears the distinct assertion of State sovereignty,  and nowhere the slightest suggestion of any purpose on the part of the  States to consolidate themselves into one body. Will any candid,  well-informed man assert that, at any time between 1776 and 1790, a  proposition to surrender the sovereignty of the States and merge them in  a central government would have had the least possible chance of  adoption? Can any historical fact be more demonstrable than that the  States did, both in the Confederation and in the Union, retain their  sovereignty and independence as distinct communities, voluntarily  consenting to federation, but never becoming the fractional parts of a  nation? That such opinions should find adherents in our day, may be  attributable to the natural law of aggregation; surely not to a  conscientious regard for the terms of the compact for union by the  States.    In all free governments the constitution or organic law is supreme over  the government, and in our Federal Union this was most distinctly marked  by limitations and prohibitions against all which was beyond the  expressed grants of power to the General Government. In the foreground,  therefore, I take the position that those who resisted violations of the  compact were the true friends, and those who maintained the usurpation  of undelegated powers were the real enemies of the constitutional Union.

African Servitude.--A Retrospect.--Early Legislation with Regard      to the Slave-Trade.--The Southern States foremost in prohibiting      it.--A Common Error corrected.--The Ethical Question never at      Issue in Sectional Controversies.--The Acquisition of      Louisiana.--The Missouri Compromise.--The Balance of      Power.--Note.--The Indiana Case.      Inasmuch as questions growing out of the institution of negro servitude,  or connected with it, will occupy a conspicuous place in what is to  follow, it is important that the reader should have, in the very outset,  a right understanding of the true nature and character of those  questions. No subject has been more generally misunderstood or more  persistently misrepresented. The institution itself has ceased to exist  in the United States; the generation, comprising all who took part in  the controversies to which it gave rise, or for which it afforded a  pretext, is passing away; and the misconceptions which have prevailed in  our own country, and still more among foreigners remote from the field  of contention, are likely to be perpetuated in the mind of posterity,  unless corrected before they become crystallized by tacit acquiescence.    It is well known that, at the time of the adoption of the Federal  Constitution, African servitude existed in all the States that were  parties to that compact, unless with the single exception of  Massachusetts, in which it had, perhaps, very recently ceased to exist.  The slaves, however, were numerous in the Southern, and very few in the  Northern, States. This diversity was occasioned by differences of  climate, soil, and industrial interests--not in any degree by moral  considerations, which at that period were not recognized, as an element  in the question. It was simply because negro labor was more profitable  in the South than in the North that the importation of negro slaves had  been, and continued to be, chiefly directed to the Southern ports.[1]  For the same reason slavery was abolished by the States of the Northern  section (though it existed in several of them for more than fifty years  after the adoption of the Constitution), while the importation of slaves  into the South continued to be carried on by Northern merchants and  Northern ships, without interference in the traffic from any quarter,  until it was prohibited by the spontaneous action of the Southern States  themselves.    The Constitution expressly forbade any interference by Congress with the  slave-trade--or, to use its own language, with the \"migration or  importation of such persons\" as any of the States should think proper to  admit--\"prior to the year 1808.\" During the intervening period of more  than twenty years, the matter was exclusively under the control of the  respective States. Nevertheless, every Southern State, without  exception, either had already enacted, or proceeded to enact, laws  forbidding the importation of slaves.[2] Virginia was the first of all  the States, North or South, to"]]]
