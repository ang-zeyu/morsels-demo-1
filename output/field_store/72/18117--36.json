Large vase in representation of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19608"],[0,"The Story of the Other Wise Man (#4)"],[1,"of rock thrust  themselves above the surface here and there, like the bones of perished  monsters. Arid and inhospitable mountain ranges rose before him,  furrowed with dry channels of ancient torrents, white and ghastly as  scars on the face of nature. Shifting hills of treacherous sand were  heaped like tombs along the horizon. By day, the fierce heat pressed  its intolerable burden on the quivering air; and no living creature  moved on the dumb, swooning earth, but tiny jerboas scuttling through  the parched bushes, or lizards vanishing in the clefts of the rock. By  night the jackals prowled and barked in the distance, and the lion made  the black ravines echo with his hollow roaring, while a bitter,  blighting chill followed the fever of the day. Through heat and cold,  the Magian moved steadily onward.    Then I saw the gardens and orchards of Damascus, watered by the streams  of Abana and Pharpar, with their sloping swards inlaid with bloom, and  their thickets of myrrh and roses. I saw also the long, snowy ridge of  Hermon, and the dark groves of cedars, and the valley of the Jordan,  and the blue waters of the Lake of Galilee, and the fertile plain of  Esdraelon, and the hills of Ephraim, and the highlands of Judah.  Through all these I followed the figure of Artaban moving steadily  onward, until he arrived at Bethlehem. And it was the third day after  the three wise men had come to that place and had found Mary and  Joseph, with the young child, Jesus, and had lain their gifts of gold  and frankincense and myrrh at his feet.    Then the other wise man drew near, weary, but full of hope, bearing his  ruby and his pearl to offer to the King. \"For now at last,\" he said, \"I  shall surely find him, though it be alone, and later than my brethren.  This is the place of which the Hebrew exile told me that the prophets  had spoken, and here I shall behold the rising of the great light. But  I must inquire about the visit of my brethren, and to what house the  star directed them, and to whom they presented their tribute.\"    The streets of the village seemed to be deserted, and Artaban wondered  whether the men had all gone up to the hill-pastures to bring down  their sheep. From the open door of a low stone cottage he heard the  sound of a woman's voice singing softly. He entered and found a young  mother hushing her baby to rest. She told him of the strangers from the  far East who had appeared in the village three days ago, and how they  said that a star had guided them to the place where Joseph of Nazareth  was lodging with his wife and her new-born child, and how they had paid  reverence to the child and given him many rich gifts.    \"But the travellers disappeared again,\" she continued, \"as suddenly as  they had come. We were afraid at the strangeness of their visit. We  could not understand it. The man of Nazareth took the babe and his  mother and fled away that same night secretly, and it was whispered  that they were going far away to Egypt. Ever since, there has been a  spell upon the village; something evil hangs over it. They say that the  Roman soldiers are coming from Jerusalem to force a new tax from us,  and the men have driven the flocks and herds far back among the hills,  and hidden themselves to escape it.\"    Artaban listened to her gentle, timid speech, and the child in her arms  looked up in his face and smiled, stretching out its rosy hands to  grasp at the winged circle of gold on his breast. His heart warmed to  the touch. It seemed like a greeting of love and trust to one who had  journeyed long in loneliness and perplexity, fighting with his own  doubts and fears, and following a light that was veiled in clouds.    \"Might not this child have been the promised Prince?\" he asked within  himself, as he touched its soft cheek. \"Kings have been born ere now in  lowlier houses than this, and the favorite of the stars may rise even  from a cottage. But it has not seemed good to the God of wisdom to  reward my search so soon and so easily. The one whom I seek has gone  before me; and now I must follow the King to Egypt.\"    The young mother laid the babe in its cradle, and rose to minister to  the wants of the strange guest that fate had brought into her house.  She set food before him, the plain fare of peasants, but willingly  offered, and therefore full of refreshment for the soul as well as for  the body. Artaban accepted it gratefully; and, as he ate, the child  fell into a happy slumber, and murmured sweetly in its dreams, and a  great peace filled the quiet room.    But suddenly there came the noise of a wild confusion and uproar in the  streets of the village, a shrieking and wailing of women's voices, a  clangor of brazen trumpets and a clashing of swords, and a desperate  cry: \"The soldiers! the soldiers of Herod! They are killing our  children.\"    The young mother's face grew white with terror. She clasped her child  to her bosom, and crouched motionless in the darkest corner of the  room, covering him with the folds of her robe, lest he should wake and  cry.    But Artaban went quickly and stood in the doorway of the house. His  broad shoulders filled the portal from side to side, and the peak of  his white cap all but touched the lintel.    The soldiers came hurrying down the street with bloody hands and  dripping swords. At the sight of the stranger in his imposing dress  they hesitated with surprise. The captain of the band approached the  threshold to thrust him aside. But Artaban did not stir. His face was  as calm as though he were watching the stars, and in his eyes there  burned that steady radiance before which even the half-tamed hunting  leopard shrinks, and the fierce blood-hound pauses in his leap. He held  the soldier silently for an instant, and then said in a low voice:    [Illustration - \"There is none here save me.\"]    \"I am all alone in this place, and I am waiting to give this jewel to  the prudent captain who will leave me in peace.\"    He showed the ruby, glistening in the hollow of his hand like a great  drop of blood.    The captain was amazed at the splendor of the gem. The pupils of his  eyes expanded with desire, and the hard lines of greed wrinkled around  his lips. He stretched out his hand and took the ruby.    \"March on!\" he cried to his men, \"there is no child here. The house is  still.\"    The clamor and the clang of arms passed down the street as the headlong  fury of the chase sweeps by the secret covert where the trembling deer  is hidden. Artaban re-entered the cottage. He turned his face to the  east and prayed:    \"God of truth, forgive my sin! I have said the thing that is not, to  save the life of a child. And two of my gifts are gone. I have spent  for man that which was meant for God. Shall I ever be worthy to see the  face of the King?\"    But the voice of the woman, weeping for joy in the shadow behind him,  said very gently:    \"Because thou hast saved the life of my little one, may the Lord bless  thee and keep thee; the Lord make His face to shine upon thee and be  gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee and give  thee peace.\"        IN THE HIDDEN WAY OF SORROW      Then again there was a silence in the Hall of Dreams, deeper and more  mysterious than the first interval, and I understood that the years of  Artaban were flowing very swiftly under the stillness of that clinging  fog, and I caught only a glimpse, here and there, of the river of his  life shining through the shadows that concealed its course.    I saw him moving among the throngs of men in populous Egypt, seeking  everywhere for traces of the household that had come down from  Bethlehem, and finding them under the spreading sycamore-trees of  Heliopolis, and beneath the walls of the Roman fortress of New Babylon  beside the Nile--traces so faint and dim that they vanished before him  continually, as footprints on the hard river-sand glisten for a moment  with moisture and then disappear.    I saw him again at the foot of the pyramids, which lifted their sharp  points into the intense saffron glow of the sunset sky, changeless  monuments of the perishable glory and the imperishable hope of man. He  looked up into the vast countenance of the crouching Sphinx and vainly  tried to read the meaning of the calm eyes and smiling mouth. Was it,  indeed, the mockery of all effort and all aspiration, as Tigranes had  said--the cruel jest of a riddle that has no answer, a search that  never can succeed? Or was there a touch of pity and encouragement in  that inscrutable smile--a promise that even the defeated should attain  a victory, and the disappointed should discover a prize, and the  ignorant should be made wise, and the blind should see, and the  wandering should come into the haven at last?    I saw him again in an obscure house of Alexandria, taking counsel with  a Hebrew rabbi. The venerable man, bending over the rolls of parchment  on which the prophecies of Israel were written, read aloud the pathetic  words which foretold the sufferings of the promised Messiah--the  despised and rejected of men, the man of sorrows and the acquaintance  of grief.    \"And remember, my son,\" said he, fixing his deep-set eyes upon the face  of Artaban, \"the King whom you are seeking is not to be found in a  palace, nor among the rich and powerful. If the light of the world and  the glory of Israel had been appointed to come with the greatness of  earthly splendor, it must have appeared long ago. For no son of Abraham  will ever again rival the power which Joseph had in the palaces of  Egypt, or the magnificence of Solomon throned between the lions in  Jerusalem. But the light for which the world is waiting is a new light,  the glory that shall rise out of patient and triumphant suffering. And  the kingdom which is to be established forever is a new kingdom, the  royalty of perfect and unconquerable love.    \"I do not know how this shall come to pass, nor"]]]
