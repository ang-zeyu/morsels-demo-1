The western building  was a bath-house, with hot-rooms at the east end, and the dressing-room,  latrine, and cold-bath at the west end; one side of this building was  hewn into the solid rock to a height of 3 feet. Several fibulae were  found in the drains of the bath-house.    [Illustration: FIG. 6. BARRACKS (?), HOLT    (A. Rubbish pits; B. Latrines?; C. Water-pipe; D. Bronze Age burial)]    [Illustration: FIG. 7. DWELLING-HOUSE AND BATH-HOUSE, HOLT]    The other structures (3, 4, 6, 7) served industrial purposes. No. 4  (fig. 5) contained a hypocaust and was perhaps a workroom and drying  shed. At 6 were ill-built and ill-preserved rooms, containing puddled  clay, potsherds, &c., which declared them to be work-sheds of some sort.  Finally, at 3 and 5 we have the kilns. No. 3 was a kiln 17 feet square,  with a double flue, used (as its contents showed) for potting, and  indeed for fine potting. No. 5 (figs. 8, 9) was an elaborate 'plant' of  eight kilns in an enclosure of about 55 x 140 feet. Kilns A, B, F, H  were used for pottery, C, D, E for tiles, F for both large vessels and  tiles; the circular kiln G seems to be a later addition to the original  plan. The kilns were thus grouped together for economy in handling the  raw and fired material and in stacking the fuel, and also for economy  of heat; the three tile-kilns in the centre would be charged, fired,  and drawn in turn, and the heat from them would keep warm the smaller  pottery-kilns round them. The interiors of the kilns contained many  broken and a few perfect pots and tiles; round them lay an enormous  mass of wood-ashes, broken tiles and pots, 'wasters' and the like.  The wood-ashes seem to be mainly oak, which abounds in the neighbourhood  of Holt. The kilns themselves are exceptionally well-preserved. They  must have been in actual working order, when abandoned, and so they  illustrate--perhaps better than any kilns as yet uncovered and recorded  in any Roman province--the actual mechanism of a Roman tile- or  pottery-kiln. The construction of a kiln floor, which shall work  effectively and accurately, is less simple than it looks; the adjustment  of the heat to the class of wares to be fired, the distribution of the  heat by proper flues and by vent-holes of the right size, and other such  details require knowledge and care. The remains at Holt show these  features admirably, and Mr. Acton has been able to examine them with the  aid of two of our best experts on pottery-making, Mr. Wm. and Mr. Joseph  Burton, of Manchester.    [Illustration: FIG. 8. PLAN OF KILN-PLANT AT HOLT (SEE p. 34, and FIG. 9)    (Except at kilns F, G, the letters on the plan are placed at the  fire-holes. In kilns A, B a small piece of the kiln floor (on which the  vessels were placed for baking) is shown diagrammatically, to illustrate  the relation between the hot-air holes in the floors and the passages in  the underlying heating-chambers)]    [Illustration: FIG. 9. RESTORATION OF THE HOLT KILN-PLANT, SHOWING THE  FLOORS ON WHICH THE TILES OR VESSELS WERE PILED FOR BAKING (p. 18)    The letters ABCDE are placed at the mouths of the stoke-holes of the  respective kilns. Kilns ABDFH were used for pottery, CDE for tiles, F  for large vessels and for tiles; G seems an addition to the original  plan.]    Smaller finds include two centurial stones (one found in 1914 is  described below, p. 34); a mill-stone with letters suggesting that it  belonged to a century of soldiers; several _graffiti_, mostly of a  military character, so far as one can decipher them (for one see my  Report for 1913, p. 30); a profusion of stamped tiles of the Twentieth  Legion, mostly 'wasters'; some two dozen antefixes of the same legion;  several tile and pottery stamps; about 45 coins of various dates; much  window glass, and an immense quantity of potsherds of the most various  kinds. Among these latter were Samian pieces of the late first century  (no '29', but early '37' and '78' and a stamp of CRESTO) and of the  second century (including the German stamp IANVF), and imitation Samian  made on the spot. A quantity of lead and of iron perhaps worked into  nails, &c., at Holt, and a few crucibles for casting small bronze  objects, may also be mentioned.    The Twentieth Legion tiles at Holt bear stamps identical with those on  its tiles at Chester; we may think that the legion made for itself at  Holt most of the tiles which it used in its fortress. Equal interest  and more novelty attaches to the pottery made at Holt. This comprises  many varieties; most prominent is a reddish or buff ware of excellent  character, coated with a fine slip, which occurs in many different forms  of vessels, cooking pots, jars, saucers, and even large flat dishes up  to 30 inches in diameter. Specimens of these occur also in Chester,  and it is clear that the legionary workmen made not only tiles--as in  legionary tile-works in other lands--but also pots, mortaria (fig. 1),  &c., for legionary use.    Perhaps the most remarkable pieces among the pottery are some stamped  pieces copied from decorated Samian, which I am able to figure here by  Mr. Acton's kindness (figs. 1, 10, 11). They are pale reddish-brown in  colour and nearly as firm in texture as good Samian; they are made (he  tells me) by throwing on a wheel a clay (or 'body') prepared from local  materials, then impressing the stamps, and finally laying on an iron  oxide slip, perhaps with a brush. Sir Arthur Evans has pointed out to me  that the stamp used for the heads on fig. 1 was a gem set in a ring; the  setting is clearly visible under each head. The shape and ornament have  plainly been suggested by specimens of Samian '37' bowls, probably of  the second century. How far the author tried to copy definite pieces of  Samian and how far he aimed at giving the general effect, is not quite  clear to me. The large circles on fig. 11 suggest the medallions of  Lezoux potters like Cinnamus; the palmettes might have been taken from  German originals. Very few of these interesting pieces were found--all  of them close to the kiln numbered 3 on fig. 5.    [Illustration: FIG. 10. HOLT, STAMPED WARE IN IMITATION OF SAMIAN, SHAPE  37 (1/1)]    An even more striking piece (fig. 1) is a 'poincon' bearing the head of  Silenus in relief. It is believed to be the artist's die, from which the  potters' sunk dies would be cast; from such sunk dies little casts would  be made and 'applied' in relief to the outsides of the bowls, to the  handles of jugs, &c. It does not seem to have been intended for any sort  of ware made from a mould; indeed, moulded ware rarely occurs among the  products of Holt. It is far finer work than most Samian ornamentation;  probably, however, it has never been damaged by use. It was found, with  one or two less remarkable dies, in the waste round kiln 3.    [Illustration: FIG. 11. STAMPED WARE, IN IMITATION OF SAMIAN, SHAPE 37  (1/1). (See pp. 19, 20)]    Interest attaches also to various vessels, two or three nearly perfect  and many broken, which have been glazed with green, brown or yellow  glaze; some of these pieces seem to be imitated from cut glass ware.  Along with them Mr. Acton has found the containing bowls (saggars) and  kiln-props used to protect and support the glazed vessels during the  process of firing, and as the drip of the glaze is visible on the sides  of the props and the bottoms of the saggars, he infers that the Holt  potters manufactured glazed ware with success.    It is obvious that Mr. Acton's detailed report on Holt will be full of  important matter, and that further excavation of the site, whenever it  may be possible, will also yield important results.    (xiii) _Cardiff._ The widening of Duke Street, which fronts the eastern  half of the south side of Cardiff Castle, has revealed the south-east  angle of the Roman fort, on the top of which the castle stands, and has  revealed it in good preservation. Nothing, however, has come to light  which seems to increase or alter our previous knowledge of the fort.  Many small Roman objects are stated to have been found, Samian ware,  coins, brooches, beads, in the course of the work; these may belong to  the 'civil settlement' which, as I have said elsewhere, may have lain to  the south of the fort (_Military Aspects of Roman Wales_, p. 105). When  they have been sorted and dated, they should throw light on the history  of Roman Cardiff.    (xiv) _Richborough._ This important site has been taken over by H.M.  Office of Works, and some digging has been done round the central  platform, but (Mr. Peers tells me) without any notable result. The  theory that this platform was the base of a lighthouse is still the  most probable.      xv-xxv. FINDS RELATING TO CIVIL LIFE    (xv) _Wroxeter (Viroconium)._ The systematic excavation of Wroxeter  begun in 1912 by Mr. J. P. Bushe-Fox on behalf of the London Society of  Antiquaries and the Shropshire Archaeological Society, was carried by  him through its third season in 1914. The area examined lay immediately  north of the temple uncovered in 1913. The main structure in it was a  large dwelling-house 115 feet long, with extensions up to 200 feet,  which possessed at least two courtyards, a small detached bath-house,  various mosaic and cement floors, hypocausts, and so forth. It had been  often altered, and its excavation and explanation were excessively  difficult. Mr. Bushe-Fox thinks that it may have begun as three shops  giving on to the north and south Street which bounds its eastern end.  Certainly it became, in course of time, a large corridor-house with a  south aspect and an eastern wing fronting the street, and as such it  underwent several changes in detail. Beyond its western end lay a still  more puzzling structure. An enceinte formed by two parallel walls, about  13 feet apart, enclosed a rectangular space of about 150 feet wide; the  western end of it, and therefore"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19116"],[0,"How to Sing (#4)"],[1,"sometimes, generally quite  unconsciously, are heard from young singers, and especially from  beginners, and never fail to make an impression. The teacher hears  that they are good, so does the public. Only a very few know why, even  among singers, because only a very few know the laws governing perfect  tone production. Their talent, their ear perchance, tell them the  truth; but the causes they neither know nor look for.    On such \"unconscious singing\" directors, managers, and even  conductors, build mistakenly their greatest hopes. No one hears what  is lacking, or what will soon be lacking, and all are surprised when  experienced singers protest against it.    They become enthusiastic, properly, over beautiful voices, but pursue  quite the wrong path in training them for greater tasks. As soon as  such persons are obtained, they are immediately bundled into _all_  roles; they have hardly time to learn one role by heart, to say  nothing of comprehending it and working it up artistically. The stars  must shine _immediately_! But with what resources? With the fresh  voice alone? Who is there to teach them to use their resources on the  stage? Who to husband them for the future? The manager? the director?  Not at all. When the day comes that they can no longer perform what,  not they themselves, but the directors, expected of them, they are put  to one side, and if they do not possess great energy and strength,  often entirely succumb. They could not meet the demands made upon  them, because they did not know how to use their resources.    I shall be told that tones well sung, even unconsciously, are enough.  But that is not true. The least unfavorable circumstance,  over-exertion, indisposition, an unaccustomed situation, anything can  blow out the \"unconscious\" one's light, or at least make it flicker  badly. Of any self-help, when there is ignorance of all the  fundamentals, there can be no question. Any help is grasped at. Then  appears the so-called (but false) \"individuality,\" under whose mask so  much that is bad presents itself to art and before the public.    This is not remarkable, in view of the complexity of the phenomena of  song. Few teachers concern themselves with the fundamental studies;  they often do not sing at all themselves, or they sing quite wrongly;  and consequently can neither describe the vocal sensations nor test  them in others. Theory alone is of no value whatever. With old singers  the case is often quite the contrary--so both seize whatever help they  can lay hold of. The breath, that vibrates against the soft palate,  when it is raised, or behind it in the cavities of the head, produces  whirling currents through its continuous streaming forth and its  twofold division. These currents can circulate only in unbroken  completeness of form. The longer their form remains unimpaired, and  the more economically the continuous breath pressure is maintained,  the less breath do these currents need, the less is emitted unused  from the mouth.    If an elastic form is found in the mouth in which the currents can  circulate untouched by any pressure or undue contraction or expansion  of it, the breath becomes practically unlimited. That is the simple  solution of the paradox that without deep breathing one may often have  much breath, and, after elaborate preparations, often none at all;  because the chief attention is generally directed to inhalation,  instead of to the elastic forming of the organs for the breath, sound  currents, and tone. The one thing needed is the knowledge of the  causes, and the necessary skill in preparing the form, avoiding all  pressure that could injure it, whether originating in the larynx,  tongue, or palate, or in the organs that furnish the breath pressure.    The singer's endeavors, consequently, must be directed to keeping the  breath as long as possible sounding and vibrating not only forward but  back in the mouth, since the resonance of the tone is spread upon and  above the entire palate, extends from the front teeth to the wall of  the throat. He must concern himself with preparing for the vibrations,  pliantly and with mobility, a powerful, elastic, almost floating  envelope, which must be filled entirely, with the help of a continuous  vocal mixture,--a mixture of which the components are indistinguishable.          SECTION IV    THE SINGER'S PHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES      Science has explained all the processes of the vocal organs in their  chief functions, and many methods of singing have been based upon  physiology, physics, and phonetics. To a certain extent scientific  explanations are absolutely necessary for the singer--as long as they  are confined to the sensations in singing, foster understanding of the  phenomenon, and summon up an intelligible picture. This is what  uninterpreted sensations in singing cannot do; of which fact the  clearest demonstration is given by the expressions, \"bright,\" \"dark,\"  \"nasal,\" \"singing forward,\" etc., that I began by mentioning and that  are almost always falsely understood. They are quite meaningless  without the practical teachings of the sensations of such singers as  have directed their attention to them with a knowledge of the end in  view, and are competent to correlate them with the facts of science.    The singer is usually worried by the word \"physiology\"; but only  because he does not clearly understand the limits of its teachings.  The singer need, will, and must, know a little of it. We learn so much  that is useless in this life, why not learn that which is of the  utmost service to us? What, in brief, does it mean? Perfect  consciousness in moving the vocal organs, and through the aid of the  ear, in placing them at will in certain relations with each other; the  fact that the soft palate can be drawn up against the hard palate;  that the tongue is able to take many different positions, and that the  larynx, by the assistance of the vocal sound oo, takes a low position,  and by that of the vowel [=a] a high one; that all muscles contract in  activity and in normal inactivity are relaxed; that we must strengthen  them by continued vocal gymnastics so that they may be able to  sustain long-continued exertion; and must keep them elastic and use  them so. It includes also the well-controlled activity of diaphragm,  chest, neck, and face muscles. This is all that physiology means for  the vocal organs. Since these things all operate together, one without  the others can accomplish nothing; if the least is lacking, singing is  quite impossible, or is entirely bad.    [Illustration: Cavity of the forehead, high range.    Nasal cavity, middle range.    Palatal resonance, low range.    Soft palate laid back against the wall of the throat in low tones,  lowered in high tones.    Red lines denote the resonance.]    Physiology is concerned also with muscles, nerves, sinews, ligaments,  and cartilage, all of which are used in singing, but all of which we  cannot feel. We cannot even feel the vocal cords. Certainly much  depends for the singer upon their proper condition; and whether as  voice producers or breath regulators, we all have good reason always  to spare them as much as possible, and never to overburden them.    Though we cannot feel the vocal cords, we can, nevertheless, hear, by  observing whether the tone is even,--in the emission of the breath  under control,--whether they are performing their functions properly.  Overburdening them through pressure, or emitting of the breath without  control, results in weakening them. The irritation of severe coughing,  thoughtless talking or shouting immediately after singing may also set  up serious congestion of the vocal cords, which can be remedied only  through slow gymnastics of the tongue and laryngeal muscles, by the  pronunciation of vowels in conjunction with consonants. Inactivity of  the vocal organs will not cure it, or perhaps not till after the lapse  of years.    A good singer can _never_ lose his voice. Mental agitation or severe  colds can for a time deprive the singer of the use of his vocal  organs, or seriously impair them. Only those who have been singing  without consciously correct use of their organs can become  disheartened over it; those who know better will, with more or less  difficulty, cure themselves, and by the use of vocal gymnastics bring  their vocal organs into condition again.    For this reason, if for no other, singers should seek to acquire  accurate knowledge of their own organs, as well as of their functions,  that they may not let themselves be burnt, cut, and cauterized by  unscrupulous physicians. Leave the larynx and all connected with it  alone; strengthen the organs by daily vocal gymnastics and a healthy,  _sober_ mode of life; beware of catching cold after singing; do not  sit and talk in restaurants.    Students of singing should use the early morning hours, and fill their  days with the various branches of their study. Sing every day only so  much, that on the next day you can practise again, feeling fresh and  ready for work, as _regular_ study requires. Better one hour every day  than ten to-day and none tomorrow.    The public singer should also do his practising early in the day, that  he may have himself well in hand by evening. How often one feels  indisposed in the morning! Any physical reason is sufficient to make  singing difficult, or even impossible; it need not be connected  necessarily with the vocal organs; in fact, I believe it very rarely  is. For this reason, in two hours everything may have changed.    I remember a charming incident in New York. Albert Niemann, our heroic  tenor, who was to sing _Lohengrin_ in the evening, complained to me in  the morning of severe hoarseness. To give up a role in America costs  the singer, as well as the director, much money. My advice was to  wait.    _Niemann._ What do you do, then, when you are hoarse?    _I._ Oh, I practise and see whether"]]]
