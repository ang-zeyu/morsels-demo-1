That lane is now called \"King-street-lane, Soho.\"  I remember my mother,  one Sunday, buying me a lot of apples for a penny, which were set out on  a table at the gate.  There were a great many apple, pear, and damson  trees in the garden.  When the Friends' Institute was building I heard of  the discovery of an old cottage, which had been hidden from view as it  were for many years.  I went to see it--the sight of it brought tears in  my old eyes, for I recognised the place at once, and thought of my good  and kind mother, and her friendly and loving ways.  Where the timber-yard  was once in Norton-street, there used to be a farm-house.  The Moss-lake  Stream ran by it on its way to Byrom-street.  I can very well remember  Norton-street and the streets thereabout being formed.  At the top of  Stafford-street, laid out at the same time, there was a smithy and forge;  the machinery of the bellows was turned by the water from the Moss-lake  Brook, which ran just behind the present Mill Tavern.  There the water  was collected in an extensive dam, in shape like a \"Ruperts' Drop,\" the  overflow turned some of the mill machinery.  Many and many a fish have I  caught out of that mill-dam.  The fields at the back, near Folly-lane,  were flooded one winter, and frozen over, when I and many other boys went  to slide on them.    The Folly Gardens were very tastefully laid out.  Mr. Gibson was a  spirited person, and spared no expense to keep the place in order.  There  were two bowling-greens in it, and a skittle-alley.  There was a cockpit  once, outside the gardens; but that was many years before my time.  It  was laid bare when they were excavating for Islington Market.  When I was  a boy its whereabouts was not known; it was supposed to have been of  great antiquity.  How time brings things to light!  The gardens were full  of beautiful flowers and noble shrubs.  There was a large fish-pond in  the middle of a fine lawn, and around it were benches for the guests,  who, on fine summer evenings, used to sit and smoke, and drink a sort of  compound called \"braggart,\" which was made of ale, sugar, spices, and  eggs, I believe.  I used to sail a little ship in that pond, made for me  by the mate of the _Mary Ellen_.  I one day fell in, and was pulled out  by Mr. Gibson himself, who fortunately happened to be passing near at  hand.  He took me in his arms dripping as I was, into the tavern and I  was put to bed, while a man was sent down to Church-street, to acquaint  my parents with my disaster, and for dry clothes.  My mother came up in a  terrible fright, but my father only laughed heartily at the accident,  saying he had been overboard three times before he was my age.  He must  have had a charmed life, if he spoke true, for I don't think I could have  been above eight years old then.  My father was well acquainted with Mr.  Gibson, and after I had got on my dry clothes, he took us up to the top  of the Gazebo, or look-out tower.  It was a beautiful evening, and the  air was quite calm and clear.  The view was magnificent.  We could see  Beeston Castle quite plainly, and Halton Castle also, as well as the  Cheshire shore and the Welsh mountains.  The view out seaward was truly  fine.  Young as I was, I was greatly struck with the whole scene.  It was  just at the time when the Folly Fair was held, and the many objects at  our feet made the whole view one of intense interest.  The rooms in the  tower were then filled with company.  Folly Fair was held on the open  space of ground afterwards used as Islington Market.  Booths were erected  opposite the Infirmary and in Folly Lane.  It was like all such  assemblages--a great deal of noise, drunkenness, debauchery, and  foolishness.  But fairs were certainly different then from what they have  been of late years.  They are now conducted in a far more orderly manner  than they were formerly.  I went to a large one some years ago, in  Manchester, and, on comparing it with those of my young days, I could  hardly believe it was a fair.  It seemed to be only the ghost of one, so  grim and ghastly were the proceedings.    I recollect the celebrated Mr. John Howard, \"the philanthropist,\" coming  to Liverpool in 1787.  He had a letter of introduction to my father, and  was frequently at our house.  He was a thin, spare man, with an  expressive eye and a determined look.  He used to go every day to the  Tower Prison at the bottom of Water-street; and he exerted himself  greatly to obtain a reform in the atrocious abuses which then existed in  prison discipline.  In the present half-century there has been great  progress made in the improvement of prison discipline, health, and  economy.  Where formerly existed notorious and disgraceful abuses, the  most abject misery, and the very depth of dirt, we find good management,  cleanliness, reformatory measures, and firm steps taken to reclaim both  the bodies and souls of the erring.  It is a most strange circumstance  that the once gross and frightful abuses of the prison system did not  _force_ themselves upon the notice of government--did not attract the  attention of local rulers, and cry out themselves for change.  Still more  strange is it that, although Mr Howard in 1787, and again in 1795, and  Mr. James Nield (whose acquaintance I also made in 1803), pointed out so  distinctly the abuses that existed in our prisons, the progress of reform  therein was strangely slow, and moved with most apathetic steps.  Howard  lifted up the veil and exposed to light the iniquities prevalent within  our prison walls; but no rapid change was noticeable in consequence of  his appalling revelations.  To show how careless the authorities were  about these matters, we can see what Mr. Nield said eight years after Mr.  Howard's second visit, in 1795, in his celebrated letters to Dr. Lettsom,  who, by the way, resided in Camberwell Grove, Surrey, in the house said  to have belonged to the uncle of George Barnwell.  Now, it should be  borne in mind that Mr. Howard actually received the freedom of the  borough, with many compliments upon his exertions in the cause of the  poor inmates of the gaol, and yet few or no important steps were taken to  remedy the glaring evils which he pointed out.  Some feeble reforms  certainly did take place immediately after his first and second visits to  Liverpool, but a retrograde movement succeeded, and things relapsed into  their usual jog-trot way of dirt and disorder.  When Mr. Howard received  the freedom of the borough an immense fuss was made about him; people  used to follow him in the street, and he was _feted_ and invited to  dinners and parties; and there was no end of speechifying.  But what did  it all come to?  Why, nothing, except a little cleaning out of passages  and whitewashing of walls.  I went with Mr. Howard several times, over  the Tower Prison, and also with Mr. Nield, in 1803.  As it then appeared  I will try to describe it.    The keeper of the Tower or Borough Gaol, which stood at the bottom of  Water-street in 1803, was Mr. Edward Frodsham, who was also  sergeant-at-mace.  His salary was 130 pounds per annum.  His fees were  4s. for criminal prisoners, and 4s. 6d. for debtors.  The Rev. Edward  Monk was the chaplain.  His salary was 31 pounds 10s. per annum; but his  ministrations did not appear to be very efficacious, as, on one occasion,  when Mr. Nield went to the prison chapel in company with two of the  borough magistrates, he found, out of one hundred and nine prisoners,  only six present at service.  The sick were attended by a surgeon from  the Dispensary, in consideration of 12 guineas per annum, contributed by  the corporation to that most praiseworthy institution.  There was a sort  of sick ward in the Tower, but it was a wretched place, being badly  ventilated and extremely dirty.  When Mr. Nield and I visited the prison  in 1803, we did not find the slightest order or regulation.  The  prisoners were not classed, nor indeed, separated; men and women, boys  and girls, debtor and felon, young and old, were all herded together,  meeting daily in the courtyards of the prison.  The debtors certainly had  a yard to themselves, but they had free access to the felon's yard, and  mixed unrestrainedly with them.  The prison allowance was a three-penny  loaf of 1lb. 3oz. to each prisoner daily.  Convicts were allowed 6d. per  day.  The mayor gave a dinner at Christmas to all the inmates.  Firing  was found by the corporation throughout the building.  There were  seventy-one debtors and thirty-nine felons confined on the occasion of  our visit.  In one of the Towers there were seven rooms allotted to  debtors, and three in another tower, in what was called \"the masters  side.\"  The poorer debtors were allowed loose straw to lie upon.  Those  who could afford to do so, paid ls. per week for the use of a bed  provided by the gaoler.  The detaining creditor of debtors had to pay  \"groating money,\" that is to say, 4d. per day for their maintenance.  In  the chapel there was a gallery, close to which were five sleeping-rooms  for male debtors.  The size of these cells was six feet by seven.  Over  the Pilot Office in Water-street were two rooms appropriated to the use  of female debtors.  One of these rooms contained three beds, the other  only one.  This latter room had glazed windows, and a fire-place, and  was, comparatively speaking, comfortable.  The same charge was made for  the beds in these rooms as in other parts of the prison.  The debtors  were also accommodated with rooms in a house adjoining the gaol, from  which, by the way, an escape of many of the prisoners, felon and debtor,  took place in 1807--a circumstance which created immense public interest.  When the prisoners were discovered, they stood at bay, and it was not  until they were fired upon, that they surrendered.  The criminals were  lodged in seven close dungeons 6.5 feet by 5"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#4)"],[1," \"but those are such stupid names.  I  don't know though but what they'll do.\"    The question was not discussed, for the lads busied themselves in  bedding down their own horses; and for the rest of that, day the stable  seemed to be the most important part of the house.        CHAPTER THREE.    PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY.    \"What is it ye're doing?\" said Dinny, a day or two before that proposed  for the start.    Coffee and Chicory looked up from their task, grinned, and then went on  sharpening the points of a couple of assegais upon a heavy block of  stone, which they had evidently brought from a distance.  Their faces  glistened with perspiration; their knees were covered with dust; and  they were in a wonderful state of excitement.  Resuming their work on  the instant, they tried to bring the weapons to a keen point.    \"Kill lion,\" said Coffee, laconically; and he worked away as if the lion  were round the corner waiting to be killed.    \"Then ye may just as well lave off, ye dirty little naygars; for it's my  belafe that you're not going at all.\"    Dinny went off into the house leaving the two boys apparently paralysed.  They dropped the assegais, stared at each other, and then lay down and  howled in the misery of their disappointment.    But this did not last many seconds; for Coffee sprang up and kicked  Chicory, who also rose to his feet, and in obedience to a word from his  brother they took their assegais and hid them in a tree which formed  their armoury--for out of its branches Chicory took the two kiris or  clubs; and then the boys ran round to the front, and stood making signs.    The brothers had such a keen love of anything in the way of sport that,  expecting something new, they ran out and willingly followed the two  young blacks out into the grassy plain about a mile from the house, when  after posting their young masters behind a bush, Coffee and Chicory  whispered to them to watch, and then began to advance cautiously through  the grass, kiri in hand, their eyes glistening as they keenly peered  from side to side.    \"What are they going to do?\" said Dick.    \"I don't know.  Show us something.  I wish we had brought our guns.  Look out!\"    There was a whirring of wings, and the two Zulu boys struck attitudes  that would have been models for a sculptor; then as a large bird similar  to a partridge rose up, Coffee sent his knobbed club whizzing through  the air; another bird rose, and Chicory imitated his brother's act; and  the result was, that the cleverly thrown kiris hit the birds, which fell  in amongst the long grass, from which they were retrieved by the lads  with shouts of triumph--the birds proving to be the coranne, so called  from the peculiarity of their cry.    \"Well done, boys!\" cried Jack.  \"They'll be good eating.\"    \"Boss Dick, Boss Jack take Zulu boys, now?\" said the kiri-throwers,  eagerly.    \"Why, of course.  You know you are going,\" replied Dick.    \"Dinny say Zulu boys not going,\" cried Chicory.    \"Then Dinny knows nothing about it,\" said Dick, angrily.  \"If he don't  mind he'll be left behind himself.\"    Coffee sent his kiri spinning up in the air, Chicory followed suit, each  catching the weapon again with ease; and then they both dashed off  across the plain as if mad, and to the astonishment of the brothers, who  took the brace of birds and walked back towards the house, to continue  the preparations for the start.    For there was so much to do, packing the great long tilted waggon with  necessaries, in the shape of tea, sugar, coffee, and chocolate.  Barrels  of mealies or Indian corn, and wheaten flour, besides.  Salt too, had to  be taken, and a large store of ammunition; for in addition to boxes well  filled with cartridges, they took a keg or two of powder and a quantity  of lead.  Then there were rolls of brass wire, and a quantity of showy  beads--the latter commodities to take the place of money in exchanges  with the natives--salt, powder, and lead answering the same purpose.    It was a delightful task to the boys, who thoroughly enjoyed the  packing, and eagerly asked what every package contained, when they had  no opportunity of opening it; while Mr Rogers looked on, smiling at the  interest they took.    \"Here y'are, young gentlemen,\" said Dinny.  \"The masther seems to think  that you're going to do nothing but suck sweet-stuff all the time you're  out.\"    \"Why, what's that, Dinny?\" cried Dick, who had just brought out a heavy  box.    \"Sure, it's sugar-shticks and candy,\" said Dinny; and he went off to  fetch something else.    \"Why, so it is, Dick,\" said Jack.  \"I say, father, are we to pack this  sweet-stuff in the waggon?  We don't want it.\"    \"Indeed, but we do,\" said his father, coming up.  \"Why a handful of  sweet-stuff will make friends with a Boer, when everything else fails.  Here, put this in the fore box.  Perhaps, when I bring this out you'll  be glad to get at the sweet-stuff.\"    \"What is it, father?\" said Dick.    Mr Rogers opened the little deal case and turned it out, to begin  packing it again.    \"Here's a bottle of chloroform, and another of castor oil; two bottles  of chlorodyne; a pound of Epsom salts; four large boxes of pills; a roll  of sticking-plaster; a pot of zinc ointment; and a bottle of quinine and  one of rhubarb and magnesia.\"    Jack's countenance was a study.  For as his father carefully repacked  the little box the lad's face grew into a hideous grimace.  He waited  till Mr Rogers had finished his enumeration, and then clapping his  handkerchief over his mouth, he uttered a loud \"Ugh!\" and ran and stood  a few yards away.    \"I shan't go,\" he cried.    \"Why not?\" said Mr Rogers, smiling.    \"Why the waggon will smell, of nothing but physic.  What's the good of  taking it, father?\"    \"The good?  Well, my boy, there's nothing like being prepared; and we  are going far away from doctors, if we wanted their help.  We may none  of us be unwell, but it is quite likely that we may, either of us, get a  touch of fever.  Besides, we might meet with an accident; and for my  part, as I have a little knowledge of medicine and surgery, I know  nothing more painful than to find people sick and to be unable to give  them the remedy that would make them well.  We shall be sure to find  some sick people amongst the natives, and they have a wonderful  appreciation of the white man's medicine.\"    \"Well, look here,\" said Jack, \"if you'll shut the box up very tightly,  I'll consent to come.\"    Mr Rogers smiled, and did shut the little box up very tightly, after  which the preparations went on; and it was perfectly wonderful to see  what that waggon would hold.    There was a moderate case of wines and spirits, also to act as  medicines; several dozens of coloured blankets for presents; waterproof  sheets.  A cask of paraffin oil was swung under the floor, and by it a  little cooking-stove, while beside these swung a long box containing  spades and shovels, for digging the waggon-wheels out of holes, tools  for repairs, wrenches, and jacks and axes, till it seemed as if there  would be no end to the stores and material.    Then leather slings were nailed up under the tilt for the rifles and  guns, so that they might always be ready to hand; for they were going  into the land of wild beasts and savage men.  Above all, their stores  had to be so packed that their positions could be remembered, and they  could be obtained when wanted, and yet leave space for blankets to be  spread, and the travellers find room to sleep beneath the tilt upon the  top.    The preparations went on; the black driver who was to manage the oxen  busied himself along with the foreloper, whose duty it is to walk with  the foremost oxen, in getting their great whips in trim, and in seeing  the trek-tow and dissel-boom--as the great trace and pole of the waggon  are called--were perfect; and they practised the team as well.    Many of the readers may not know that for an expedition like this, where  the waggon party expect to be travelling for months, perhaps for a year,  through a country where roads are almost unknown, and where the great  heavily-laden, but wonderfully strongly-made waggon, has to be dragged  over rocks, through swamps, and into and out of rivers, a team of  fourteen, sixteen, or, as in this case, even twenty oxen, will be yoked  to the great chain or rope called the trek-tow.  For some of the poor  animals are sure to succumb during the journey; or they may be killed  for food, the loss being not so much felt when a superabundant number is  taken.    With the leading pair of oxen walks the foreloper, whose duty it is to  choose the best road, and to avoid stones and marshy places where the  wheels would sink in; and the success of an expedition depends a good  deal upon having a good foreloper.    In this case Mr Rogers had secured a trusty Kaffir, who had been  frequently into the interior; but his appearance was against him, for he  had lost one eye, from a thrust of a bullock's horn.  But Dinny said  that the one left was as good as two, for when Dirk looked at you, it  seemed to go right through your head and tickle the hair behind.    Off to the Wilds--by George Manville Fenn        CHAPTER FOUR.    INSPANNING FOR THE TRIP.    The eventful morning at last!  Bright, clear, and the dew lying thick  upon the thirsty earth.  All the arrangements had been made; the waggon  stood ready.  Peter the driver was upon the box in front of the waggon;  the boys were mounted, and a couple of neighbours had ridden over to see  them start; but to the infinite vexation of Dick and Jack, the young  Zulus had not returned.  They had started off on the day when they  killed the coranne, and that was the last that had been seen of them.    \"Now, Dinny, you may let the dogs loose,\" cried Dick, who looked  brighter and better, his father thought, than he had been for days.  Dinny at once obeyed; when, yelping and barking with delight, the"]]]
