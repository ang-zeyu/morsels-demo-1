The white bear saw no living thing save a few fur-clad animals and a  little gray robin chirping cheerily as it picked away at an old bone.    Again the white bear looked down.  Almost at the foot of the iceberg  crouched a hunter and his little son.  Between the two a tiny fire was  blazing.    When the white bear saw the hunter and the boy guarding the fire he  growled terribly.  He leaped across from one iceberg to another.  He  went into his icy cave still growling.    \"It is the only fire in the whole north country,\" growled the white  bear to himself.  \"If I could only put out that fire the land of ice  and snow would be mine.    \"Neither the hunter nor the hunter's son could live, without fire.  I  will watch my chance.  Perhaps some day I shall be so lucky as to put  the fire out.\"    Now the Eskimo night is weeks long.  All through the long night the  hunter kept the fire.  All through the long night the white bear  crouched near and growled deeply.    At length the hunter fell ill.  The brave little boy kept the fire  burning.  He also cared for his sick father.    The white bear crept closer now, and growled more loudly.    He longed to jump on the fire with his wet feet and tramp it out.  But  he dared not.  The boy's bright eyes watched faithfully.  The hunter's  arrows were deadly, and the boy's aim was true.    But by and bye the boy could endure the long watch no longer.  His head  drooped.  His eyes closed.  He slept.    The white bear's growl sounded like a hideous laugh.  The little gray  robin twittered loudly in warning.  But the poor tired little fellow  heard neither the white bear's growl nor the gray robin's twitter.    Then the white bear ran swiftly to the fire.  He tramped upon it with  his cold wet feet.  He rolled upon it with his cold wet fur.  The  cheerful blaze died out.    When he arose the white bear saw only a little pile of gray ashes.  He  laughed so loudly that the boy awoke and snatched up his bow and arrows.    But the white bear ran away to his cave, still growling laughingly.  He  knew that no human being could live in that cruelly cold north country  without fire.    Now when the white bear was gone, the little gray robin hopped near.  Her chirp was quite sad.  She, too, saw nothing but a little heap of  ashes as gray as her own feathers.    She hopped nearer.  She scratched among the ashes with her cold little  claws.  She looked eagerly at each cinder with her sharp little eyes.  She found--a tiny live coal.    It was only the tiniest spark!  The least flake of the fast-falling  snow would put it out!    The little gray robin hovered over it that the cold wind might not  reach the spark.  She fanned it softly with her wings for a long, long  time.    The gray robin hovered so close that the coal touched her gray breast.  As she fanned it glowed larger and redder.  Her breast was scorched  quite red, as the coal grew.    But the robin did not leave until a fine red flame blazed up.    Then the robin with her poor scorched red breast flew away.  She flew  wearily, for she was very tired.  Now and again she touched the ground.    And wherever the robin's red breast touched the earth a fire was  kindled.  Soon the whole north country was blazing with tiny fires over  which the Eskimos might cook their food and dry their clothes.    The white bear crept far, far back into his cave.  He growled fiercely.  He knew now that he could never have the north country to himself.        [1] Adapted from Flora J. Cook's \"Nature Myths,\" by permission of A.  Flanigan, Chicago.          WHICH WAS THE WISER?[1]    One morning in the early spring a raven was sitting on one of the  branches of an old oak.  He felt very ugly and cross, and could only  say, \"Croak!  Croak!\"    Soon a little robin, who was looking for a place to build her nest,  came, with a merry song, into the same tree.  \"Good morning to you,\"  she said to the raven.    But the raven made no answer; he only looked at the clouds and croaked  something about the cold wind.  \"I said good morning to you,\" said the  robin, hopping from branch to branch.    \"You seem very merry this morning about nothing,\" croaked the raven.    \"Why should I not be merry?\" asked the robin.  \"Spring has come, and  everybody should be glad and happy.\"    \"I am not happy,\" said the raven.  \"Don't you see those black clouds  above us?  It is going to snow.\"    \"Very well,\" answered the robin, \"I shall keep on singing till it  comes, at any rate.  A merry song will not make it any colder.\"    \"You are very silly,\" croaked the raven.    The robin flew to another tree and kept on singing; but the raven sat  still and made himself very unhappy.    \"The wind is so cold,\" he said.  \"It always blows the wrong way for me.\"    Very soon the sun came out warm and bright, and the clouds went away.  But the raven was as sad as ever.    The grass began to spring up in the meadows.  Green leaves and flowers  were seen in the woods.  Birds and bees flew here and there in the glad  sunshine.  The raven sat alone on the branch of the old oak.    \"It is always too warm or too cold,\" said he.  \"To be sure it is quite  pleasant just now; but I know that the sun will soon shine hot enough  to burn one up.  Then to-morrow it will be colder than ever before.  I  do not see how any one can be so silly as to sing at such a time as  this.\"    Just then the robin came back to the tree, carrying a straw in her  mouth.    \"Well, my friend,\" asked she, \"where is your snow?\"    \"Don't say anything,\" croaked the raven.  \"It will snow all the harder  for this sunshine.\"    \"And snow or shine,\" said the robin, \"you will keep on croaking.  For  my part, I shall look on the bright side of everything, and have a song  for every day in the year.\"    Which was the wiser, the raven or the robin?

ALL ABOUT THE ROBIN    SUGGESTIONS FOR FIELD LESSONS    One of the first birds to return in the spring--migrates north early in  March--sometimes remains during winter--stays north as late as October  or November.    Domestic--generally preferring to live near the home of man.    Song--though short and always the same is in tone wonderfully  expressive of happiness, love, anger, or fear, as the case may be.    Black head--wings and tail brown--touches of white on throat--entire  breast a rusty red.--Female duller and paler in colouring, growing  almost as bright as the male in the autumn.    Food--principally insects and worms--does not disdain fruit, berries,  cherries, etc., but prefers insect food--a ravenous eater.    Nest--outer layer composed of sticks, coarse grasses, etc., seemingly  rather carelessly arranged--on this the rather large round nest is  woven with grasses--plastered with mud--lined with softer grasses.    Eggs--greenish blue--four in number--young have black spots on  breast--generally two broods reared in a season--sometimes three.          THE SWALLOW    [Illustration: The Swallow]    UNDER THE EAVES    It was the tenth day of April.  Phyllis knew the date because it  chanced to be her birthday.  She was just eight years old.    The sun shone very warm and bright, and the buds were growing big and  red on the horse-chestnut-trees.    \"I shall go down to the brook to look for pussy-willows this  afternoon,\" said the little girl.    Phyllis was sitting in the window of the barn loft with the sun shining  full upon her.  All was very quiet and the little girl was half asleep.    Suddenly, with a flash of blue wings and a funny little twitter, a bird  darted right across her face.  Phyllis sat up straight, and, leaning  out of the window, looked up at the eaves.    There she saw the merry twitterer, with several of his companions, who  seemed very busy and very talkative.    They darted here and there, they skimmed through the air so swiftly  that Phyllis could only catch a gleam of blue.  They wheeled and  circled and darted.  All the time they twittered, twittered, twittered.    \"What are they up to?\" said Phyllis, leaning farther out and looking  more closely.    For an instant one of the birds clung to the eaves and seemed to be  pecking away at a bit of mud which was stuck to the eaves.    Phyllis noticed the deeply forked tail of the bird.  Its back and wings  and tail were steel blue.  Its throat and chest were bright chestnut,  becoming paler near the back of the body.    \"Oh, I know you,\" laughed Phyllis.  \"I have no fear of frightening you,  for you are a swallow.    \"How does it happen that you are so fearless?  You are scarcely more  afraid of us than our chickens.  Why do you build so near our homes?  You are even more tame than the robin!\"    The swallow twittered in a way which made Phyllis feel that he was  laughing at her.  He darted so near that had she been quick enough she  might have caught him.    \"We are not afraid of you!\" laughed the swallow, darting close again  and then whirling away.    \"What a funny bird!\" said Phyllis.    In a moment the bird was back with a bit of mud in his mouth.  He  plastered it up against the rest of the mud under the eaves.  Then he  flew again near Phyllis.    \"I suppose there was a time,\" said the bird, \"when all swallows built  their nests on the sides and ledges of caves or cliffs.  But that was  hundreds of years ago, before men came and made barns with such  comfortable places for building.    \"To be sure there are swallows to this day who prefer the bank of a  brook or the side of a cave for their nesting-place.  But we barn  swallows like the eaves best.\"    \"You, too, are an early bird,\" said Phyllis.  \"Where did you spend the  winter?\"    There was a great twittering among the returning swallows just then and  Phyllis was obliged to wait for a reply.  Back came the bird after a  moment.    \"We went south last October,\" he said.  \"Late in September we gathered  in great flocks in the marshes.    \"For days we stayed there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#4)"],[1,"will, I am ready. I will come to your majesty  early to-morrow morning, it is too late to-day.\"    \"Very well, my brave fellow, I will expect you at dawn to-morrow.\"    Early the next morning the shepherd came to await the emperor's  commands; but as soon as the emperor heard that he had arrived, he  summoned him.    \"Tell me, my son, what is the reason the magic bird sings as soon as  you enter the church, and stops when you go out.\"    \"To understand that and other things, your majesty, let me tell you my  whole story.\"    \"I will listen; tell me anything you please.\"    The shepherd then began:--    \"I have a father, and brothers. I left my home to do something to  please my father, who was sad because he had a wish that could not be  fulfilled. After a journey of several days I reached a beautiful  meadow, from which branched several roads. Intending to spend the  night there, I lighted a fire, took out some of the provisions I had  brought with me, and was just sitting down to eat them, when I  suddenly saw a fox beside me. Whence it came I did not know; it seemed  as if it had sprung up out of the earth.    \"'Please let me warm myself by your fire,' it said. 'See, I am so cold  that my teeth chatter. Give me a bit of bread and a glass of wine,  that I may satisfy my hunger and thirst, and tie your dog, so I can  eat in peace and rest without fear.'    \"'Very well,' I replied, 'come and warm yourself. Here are my  provisions and my flask, eat and drink as much as you choose.'    \"I tied my dog, and we sat down by the fire and talked together. Among  other things, I told the fox where I was going, and even asked if it  could tell me what I should do to accomplish the task I had  voluntarily undertaken.    \"'Have no anxiety about that,' replied the fox. 'We'll set out  together early to-morrow morning, and if I don't help you to the goal,  never trust me again.'    \"We sat by the fire, feasting like two friends, then the fox bade me  good-night, and vanished like a shadow. I wondered how it had been  possible that I did not see what direction the animal took, and while  racking my brains to find out how it had managed to go and come  unperceived, I fell asleep. When the fox came at dawn next morning, it  found me gazing in astonishment at several blocks of stone, which  resembled two men, two dogs, and two horses. As soon as I saw the  animal, we prepared to set out.    \"The fox turned three somersaults and suddenly changed into a handsome  hero. On the way he told me that the place where I had spent the night  was part of his property, that he was married and had several  children, but had been condemned to wear the form of a fox until some  human being would take pity on him and receive him, let him warm  himself by the same fire, give him a bit of bread and glass of wine.  As I was this man, he was now released from the spell, and would go  with me and never leave me until I had accomplished my object. This  event pleased me, and we journeyed on and on all through the long  summer day until late at night when we reached a mountain meadow,  where we encamped. My traveling companion told me that the next day we  should be obliged to pass through the lands of several dragons, and he  thought we should there find what we sought.    \"The following morning we entered the dragons' country, though  somewhat timidly, and about noon reached the dragon-palace. It is  impossible to describe the magnificent things we saw there. Gardens  with all sorts of flowers and fruits, rooms that seemed lined with  silver, so that they shone in the sun like mirrors, walls covered with  paintings and carved flowers. Every corner of the palace was gilded,  and fountains cast jets of water into the air. Luckily for us, the  dragons were not at home when we arrived. On the threshold we met a  beautiful girl, a girl who looked as sweet as if she were made of  sugar, and who advised us not to enter the court-yard in the dragons'  absence, or we should meet with some misfortune. Then she wept for joy  at seeing people from the place from whence the dragons had stolen  her. When we asked her about the wonderful bird, she said it was in  the possession of some other dragons, relatives of those on whose  lands we were.    \"'Go there,' she added, 'for with God's help, I hope you will succeed,  and when you return, take me with you.'    \"After she had told us how we could enter the dragons' court-yard and  what we must do, I swore by what was dearest to me in the world, my  father, that I would not leave her in the dragons' power, but take  her away. Then we continued the journey. To tell the truth, I loved  her as soon as I saw her.    \"When we reached the borders of the next dragon-kingdom, we stopped to  rest, but at dawn the following day we crossed the frontier and by  noon reached their palace, which was even more beautiful than the  first one. As soon as I had dismounted from my horse, I went to the  stable, but my companion turned back, for this was what the girl had  advised. The horses were at their cribs. One turned its head and  looked at me. I patted its eyes, pulled its ears, threw a bridle over  its neck, mounted it, and in riding by, took the cage with the magic  bird that hung in the entry.\"    \"You brought the wonderful bird?\" cried the emperor. \"Then you are my  son, whom all believe dead.\"    \"Even so, father.\" And after kissing the emperor's hand, he begged him  to send for the poultry-keeper. When she came, the shepherd said,  \"This is the girl of whom I told you.\"    \"How is that possible!\" replied the emperor. \"How did she become a  poultry maid?\"    \"She'll tell you that herself. I don't know. So, as I was saying,\" he  continued, \"after I had snatched the cage I fled as fast as I could on  the horse I had taken from the dragons, but the other horses began to  neigh and make such a noise that my hair fairly bristled, yet I held  firm. The dragons chased me until I reached my comrade, who was  waiting for me on the frontier. If it had not been for him, they  would have seized me, and who knows what would have become of me then.  But my companion stretched out his hand, shouting, 'Stop!' The dragons  seemed to be suddenly turned to stone; not another step forward did  they take. After embracing and kissing me he admired the bird's  beauty. The dragons did every thing in their power to get it from me,  and made all sorts of promises, but when they saw they could not  persuade me, begged me at least to give them the horse. I perceived it  would not be right to leave them in such a sad state, so I returned  the horse and went on with my companion and the bird, but the dragons  almost stared their eyes out after it.    \"When we reached the other dragon palace, the girl was waiting for us  at the gate. Cracking her whip three times the whole building changed  into an apple, which she put in her pocket. I passed my arm around  her, and we set out. But oh! dear, when the dragons discovered it! How  they chased us, roaring so that our blood curdled in our veins. I  summoned all my courage, spurred my horse, and fled like the wind with  my companion. But the dragons came as fast as thought. When my comrade  saw this, and perceived that there was no possibility of escape, he  stopped, made a sign and turned them into blocks of stone. Then we  continued our journey till we reached the field from which we had  started and which was part of the fox's property. After we had rested  and I had thanked God that we had accomplished our task, I asked my  comrade what those stone pillars meant.    \"He answered: 'If you know you will regret it, and if you don't know,  you will also regret it.'    \"'Pray tell me.'    \"'These are your brothers,' he answered. 'Instead of kindly granting  my request, as you did, they set their hounds on me, which condemned  me to wear the loathsome fox-skin still longer, so I turned them to  stone.'    \"'For my sake,' I entreated, 'for the sake of our friendship, make  them men again as they were before.'    \"'I prize your friendship greatly,' he replied, 'so let it be as you  wish--but you'll repent it.'    \"In an instant he made a sign with his hand, the stones suddenly  shook, and my brothers remained motionless with amazement, when they  saw us before them. We took leave of my comrade and set out on our way  home. But see what a fine trick my brothers played me.    \"'Brother,' they said, after we had ridden about a mile, 'we are tired  by the long distance, and it is very warm. Let us go to a pond we know  here and each drink a little to cool ourselves.' I agreed, and we went  there. The oldest drank, so did the second one, but when I was going  to drink too, lying face downward at the edge of the pond, so that I  could reach the water with my lips, as they had done, I suddenly felt  a terrible burning sensation in both feet, and when I turned to see  the cause, could not get up; my brothers had cut off both my feet, and  then hurried off, without listening to my complaints and entreaties.    \"I spent three days and nights beside the pond. When my good horse saw  a dragon coming, it lifted me by my clothes with its teeth, ran as far  as it could and kicked so violently that no wild beast could approach  us.    \"At last, on the fourth day, I met a blind man groping his way along.  'Who are you?' I asked.    \"'A poor, maimed fellow,' said he. Then, after he had told me that his  brothers, out of envy, had put out his eyes, I told him that my  brothers had cut off my feet.    \"'I'll tell you what!' he exclaimed. 'We'll take an oath of  brotherhood. I have feet, you have eyes, so I'll carry you on my back.  I'll walk for you, and you shall see for me. A huge scorpion lives  close by, whose blood cures all kinds of diseases.'    \"I accepted his offer, and we went to the scorpion's house. He was not  at home, so the blind man put me behind the door, telling me to kill  him with my sword as soon as he came in;"]]]
