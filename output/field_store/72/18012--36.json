His hieroglyph is definitely  determined (Figs. 11, 12). The circular design in front of the forehead  of the hieroglyph head seems, as a variant from the Codex Tro. (Fig. 12)  leads us to suppose, to denote the ideographic representation of pouring  out or emptying a vessel, the contents of which flow into the mouth of  the god. Another variant of this prefix occurs in Tro. 13*b; Fig. 15,  the symbol of the sacrificial knife, and instead of the prefix the  numeral 13 occurs in one instance! (Tro. 12*c). The head alone, without  any accessory symbol whatever, is also found a few times, not in the  text, however, but only in the pictures, for example Cort. 10 (bottom)  and Tro. 13* (bottom). This deity does not occur very often in the  Dresden manuscript, the places where it is depicted are: Dr. 5a, 6c,  13b, 35a, 68a, and as a subordinate figure on 8c, 42a. His  hieroglyph occurs alone a few times, as in Dr. 4; it is more frequent in  the Madrid manuscript. It appears on pp. 15 to 18 of the Paris  manuscript.    In regard to the significance of this deity, he doubtless represents the  personification of a heavenly body of astronomic importance, probably the  polar star. In Codex Cort. 10 (bottom), his head is represented  surrounded by a nimbus of rays, which can only mean a star (see Fig. 13).  On the lower part of the same page, the third picture from the left, we  again see the deity hanging from the sky in a kind of rope. Furthermore  it appears in Codex Tro. 20, 22 and 23 (centre) Fig. 14, in the familiar  rectangular planet signs. Tro. 17* (at the top) the head surmounts the  cross-shaped tree of god B, which denotes the lofty, celestial abode.  Indeed, these passages prove positively that a heavenly body underlies  the idea of this deity.    Furthermore, the head of this god recurs in entire rows in the calendric  group of tabular form on the so-called initial page of the Codex Tro. 36,  with its continuation in the Cort. p. 22, and in exactly the same manner  in the allied passage of Tro. 14 (middle and bottom). In addition, his  head is contained in the symbol for the north (Fig. 16); the head  contained in this sign is in fact nothing else than the head of god C.    Brinton also accepts this interpretation of god C. According to  Foerstemann (Die Mayahieroglyphen, Globus, Vol. 71, No. 5), the fact that  the figure of god C in the Tonalamatl in Dr. 4a-10a occurs on the day  Chuen of the Maya calendar, which corresponds to the day Ozomatli, the  ape, in the Aztec calendar, seems to indicate that the singular head of C  is that of an _ape_, whose lateral nasal cavity (peculiar to the American  ape or monkey) is occasionally represented plainly in the hieroglyph  picture. Hence it might further be assumed that god C symbolizes not the  polar star alone, but rather the entire _constellation of the Little  Bear_. And, in fact, the figure of a long-tailed ape is quite appropriate  to the constellation, at any rate decidedly more so than the Bear;  indeed, it suggests the prehensile tail by means of which the ape could  attach himself to the pole and in the form of the constellation swing  around the pole as around a fixed point.    These astronomical surmises seem to be contradicted by the fact that god  C, as already stated, is represented with all the four cardinal points  (compare for example Cort. 10 and 11, bottom), which would certainly seem  to harmonize ill with his personification of the north star, unless we  assume, that in a different conception of the polar star he is ruler of  the cardinal points, which are determined from him as a centre.    It has already been remarked of B, that the deity C appears to stand in  some sort of relation to him. In fact, we find on those pages of the  Dresden manuscript, where B is represented with the four cardinal points,  that the hieroglyph of C almost always occurs in the text also (for  example Dr. 29, et seq., especially Dr. 32c). Indeed, C's hieroglyph is  connected even with the signs of the symbolic colors of the cardinal  points, already mentioned in connection with B.    Finally, it should be borne in mind, that god C also seems to be  connected in some way with the serpent (compare Dr. 36b, 1st and 3d  pictures).    According to Foerstemann, the day ruled by C seems to be Chuen.      D. The Moon- and Night-God.    [Illustration: Figs. 17-20]    This is a deity who is pictured in the form of an old man with an aged  face and sunken, toothless mouth. He is frequently characterized by a  long, pendent head ornament, in which is the sign Akbal, darkness, night,  which also appears in his hieroglyph before the forehead of the deity,  surrounded by dots as an indication of the starry sky. His name-hieroglyph  is Fig. 17, and a second sign almost always follows (Fig. 18) which  evidently serves likewise as a designation of the god, just as god A also  is always designated by _two_ hieroglyphs. The second sign consists of  two sacrificial knives and the sign of the day Ahau, which is equivalent  to \"king\".    The head of this deity appears in reduced, cursive form as the sign of  the moon (Fig. 20). This character also has the significance of 20 as a  number sign in the calendar. The association of these ideas probably  rests upon the ancient conceptions, according to which the moon  appearing, waxing, waning and again disappearing, was compared to man,  and man in primeval ages was the most primitive calculating machine,  being equivalent, from the sum of his fingers and toes, to the number 20.  Twenty days is also the duration of that period during which the moon  (aside from the new moon) is really _alive_. Moreover the sign (Fig. 20)  appears in many places as a counterpart of the sign for the sun.    God D occurs once as feminine in the same passage mentioned above, in  which the death-deity is also pictured as feminine (Dr. 9c). In a few  other places the god is, curiously enough, depicted with a short beard,  as Dr. 4c, 7a, 27b. He seems to stand in an unknown relation to the  water-goddess I (see this deity) with the serpent as a head ornament,  compare Dr. 9c, where apparently this goddess is represented, though the  text has D's sign; still it is possible that god D is pictured here with  the attributes of goddess I.    God D is not connected with the grim powers of destruction; he never  appears with death symbols. In Dr. 5c and 9a he wears the snail on his  head. He seems, therefore, like god A to be connected with birth. In Dr.  8c he is connected with god C, and this is quite appropriate, if we look  upon these gods as heavenly bodies. The aged face, the sunken, toothless  mouth are his distinguishing marks. In the Madrid manuscript, where god D  occurs with special frequency, his chief characteristic, by which he is  always easily recognized, is the single tooth in his under-jaw (see Fig.  19), compare too Dr. 8c, where the solitary tooth is also to be seen. In  Dr. 9a (1st figure) the god holds in his hand a kind of sprinkler with  the rattles of the rattlesnake, as Landa (Cap. 26) describes the god in  connection with the rite of infant baptism (see also Cort. 26, Tro. 7*a  and 13*c)    A very remarkable passage is Tro. 15*; there a figure is pictured carving  with a hatchet a head, which it holds in its hand. Above it are four  hieroglyphs. The first shows a hatchet and the moon; the second probably  represents simply a head, while the third and fourth are those of god D,  the moon-god. This passage, the meaning of which is unfortunately still  obscure seems to contain a definite explanation of god D.    J. Walter Fewkes has made god D the subject of a special, very detailed  monograph (The God \"D\" in the Codex Cortesianus, Washington, 1895) in  which he has treated also of gods B and G, whom he considers allied to D.  He believes D to be the god Itzamna, as do also Foerstemann, Cyrus Thomas  and Seler, and sees sun-gods in all three of these deities. Whether god D  is to be separated from G and B as an independent deity, Fewkes thinks is  doubtful. Brinton again holds that god D is Kukulcan. These different  opinions show, at all events, on what uncertain grounds such attempts at  interpretation stand, and that it is best to be satisfied with  designating the deities by letters and collecting material for their  purely descriptive designation.    According to Foerstemann the calendar day devoted to D is Ahau.      E. The Maize-God.    [Illustration: Figs. 21-27]    This god bears on his head the Kan-sign and above it the ear of maize  with leaves (Fig. 23); compare Dr. 9b (left figure), 11b, 12a, etc.  The hieroglyph is definitely determined (Fig. 21). The god is identical  with the figures recurring with especial frequency in the Madrid  manuscript, the heads of which are prolonged upward and curved backward  in a peculiar manner; compare Cort. 15a, 20c, 40 (bottom), Tro. 32*b  (Figs. 25-27) and especially the representation in Dr. 50a (Fig. 24),  which is very distinct. This head was evolved out of the conventional  drawing of the ear of maize; compare the pictures of the maize plant in  the Codex Tro., p. 29b (Fig. 22) with the head ornament of the god in  Dr. 9b (Fig. 23), 9a, 12a; what was originally a head ornament finally  passed into the form of the head itself, so that the latter appears now  as an ear of maize surrounded by leaves. Compare the pictures, Figs.  25-27. That these gods with elongated heads are, in point of fact,  identical with E is plainly seen from the passage in Dr. 2 (45)c (first  figure). There the figure represented, which is exactly like the pictures  in the Madrid manuscript, is designated explicitly as god E by the third  hieroglyph in the accompanying writing.    The hieroglyph of this deity is thus explained; it is the head of the god  merged into the conventionalized form of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18019"],[0,"The Luckiest Girl in the School (#4)"],[1,"to deal out the questions for the next  hour's examination. This was in geography, and here Winona was not on  such sure ground. Granted that you are acquainted with certain rules in  arithmetic, it is always possible to work out problems, but it needed  more knowledge than she possessed to write answers to the riddles that  confronted her. She had never heard of \"The Iron Gates,\" could not place  Alcona and Altona, was hazy as to the whereabouts of the Mourne  Mountains, and utterly unable to draw an accurate map of the Balkan  States. She scored a little on Canada, for she had learnt North America  last term at Miss Harmon's, but with Australia and New Zealand she was  imperfectly acquainted. She wrote away, getting hotter and hotter as she  realized her deficiencies, winding up five minutes before the time  allotted, in a flushed and decidedly inky condition.    At eleven a short interval was allowed, and the candidates thankfully  adjourned. Outside in the corridor they compared notes.    \"Well, of all detestable papers this geography one is the limit!\"  declared an aggrieved voice.    It was the girl who had said that she always mixed Madras and Bombay,  and who had studied her text-book up to the last available moment.  Apparently her eleventh hour industry had not sufficed to tide her over  her difficulties.    \"It was catchy in parts,\" agreed the owner of the swastika, \"but I liked  one or two questions. I just happened to know them, so I bowled ahead.  That's what comes of wearing a mascot!\"    \"Don't crow too soon!\" laughed the girl with the fair pigtail.  \"Remember, there are four other exams. to follow. Your luck may leave  you at any moment.\"    \"Don't mention more exams.! I feel inclined to turn tail and run home!\"  declared another.    \"There's the bell! Don't give us much time, do they? Now for the torture  chamber again! Brace your nerves!\"    \"I wonder if most of them have done better or worse than I have!\"  thought Winona, as she took her seat once more at No. 10 desk. \"A good  many were grumbling, but that sandy-haired girl in the spectacles said  nothing. No more did the one with the red hair-ribbon. Of course they  might be feeling too agonized for words, but on the other hand they  might be secretly congratulating themselves.\"    It was not the moment, however, for speculation as to her neighbors'  progress. The next set of questions was being distributed, and she took  up her copy eagerly. Her heart fell as she read it over. Her knowledge  of English history was not very accurate, and the facts demanded were  for the most part exactly those which she could not remember. The dread  of failure loomed up large. She could only attempt about half of the  questions, and even in these she was not ready with dates. Then suddenly  Percy's advice flashed into her mind. \"Write from a romantic standpoint,  and make your paper sound poetical.\" It seemed rather a forlorn hope,  and she feared it would scarcely satisfy her examiners, but in such a  desperate situation anything was worth trying. Winona possessed a  certain facility in essay writing. Prose composition had been her  favorite lesson at Miss Harmon's. She collected her wits now, and did  the very utmost of which she was capable in the matter of style.  Choosing question No. 4, \"Write a life of Lady Jane Grey,\" she proceeded  to treat the subject in as post-impressionist a manner as possible. The  pathetic tragedy of the young Queen had always appealed to her  imagination, and she could have had no more congenial a theme upon which  to write, if she had been given free choice of all the characters in the  history book.    \"'Whom the gods love die young,'\" she began, and paused. It seemed an  excellent opening, if she could only continue in the same strain, but  what ought to come next? Her thoughts flew to a painting of Lady Jane  Grey, which she had once seen at a loan collection of Tudor portraits.  Why should she not describe it? Her pen flew rapidly as she wrote a  word-picture of the sweet, pale face, so round and childish in spite of  its earnest expression; the smooth yellow hair, the gray eyes bent  demurely over the book. Her heroine seemed beginning to live. Now for  her surroundings. A year ago Winona had paid a visit to Hampton Court,  and her remembrance of its associations was still keen and vivid. She  described its old-world garden by the side of the Thames, where the  little King Edward VI. must often have roamed with his pretty cousin  Jane: the two wonderful ill-starred children, playing for a brief hour  in happy unconsciousness of the fate that faced them. What did they talk  about, she asked, as they stood on the paved terrace and watched the  river hurrying by? Plato, perchance, and his philosophy, or the  marvelous geography-book with woodcuts of foreign beasts that had been  specially printed for the young king's use. Did they compare notes about  their tutors? Jane would certainly hold a brief for her much-loved Mr.  Elmer, who, in sharp contrast to her parents' severity, taught her so  gently and patiently that she grudged the time which was not spent in  his presence. Edward might bemoan the ill-luck of his whipping-boy, who  had to bear the floggings which Court etiquette denied to the royal  shoulders, and perhaps would declare that when he was grown up, and  could make the laws himself, no children should be beaten for badly said  lessons, and Jane would agree with him, and then they would pick the red  damask roses that Cardinal Wolsey had planted, and walk back under the  shadow of the clipped yew hedge to eat cherries and junket in the room  that looked out towards the sunset.    Winona had warmed to her work. Her imagination, always her strongest  faculty, completely carried her away. She pictured her heroine's life,  not from the outside, as historians would chronicle it, a mere string of  events and dates, but from the inner view of a girl's standpoint. Did  Jane wish to leave her Plato for the bustle of a Court? Did she care for  the gay young husband forced upon her by her ambitious parents? Surely  for her gentle nature a crown held few allurements. The clouds were  gathering thick and fast, and burst in a waterspout of utter ruin.  Jane's courage was calm and hopeful as that of Socrates in the dialogues  she had loved.            \"... your soul was pure and true,      The good stars met in your horoscope,      Made you of spirit, fire and dew.\"    quoted Winona enthusiastically. Browning always stirred her blood, and  threw her into poetical channels. She cast about in her mind for any  other appropriate verses.        \"Ah, broken is the golden bowl, the spirit gone for ever,      Let the bell toll--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.      Come, let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung,      An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young,      A dirge for her, the doubly dead, in that she died so young.\"    \"So they finished their foul deed, and laid her to rest,\" wrote Winona,  \"the earthly part, that is, which perishes, for the true part of her  they could not touch. Farewell, sweet innocent soul, of whom the world  was not worthy. To you surely may apply Andre de Chenier's tender lines:        \"'Au banquet de la vie a peine commence      Un instant seulement mes levres out presse      La coupe en mes mains encore pleine.'    Vale, little Queen! May it be well with thee! Ave atque vale!\"    Winona glanced anxiously at the clock as with a hard breath she paused  for a moment and laid down her pen. Her theme had taken her so long that  she had only ten minutes left for the other questions. There was no  romantic side to be expressed in these, so she scribbled away  half-heartedly. Her uncertain memory, which had readily supplied  quotations from Browning or Edgar Allan Poe, struck altogether when  asked for such sordid details as the names of the Cabal ministry, or  the history of the Long Parliament. The bell rang, and left her with her  paper only half finished. At one o'clock the candidates were given an  hour's rest, and a hot lunch was served to them in the dining-hall. At  two they returned to their desks, and the examination continued until  half-past four. Winona found the questions tolerable. She did fairly,  but not at all brilliantly. Her brains were not accustomed to such  long-sustained efforts, and as the afternoon wore on, a neuralgic  headache began, and sent sharp throbs of pain across her forehead. It  was so irksome to write pages of Latin or French verbs; she had to  summon all her courage to make herself do it. The last hour seemed an  interminable penance.    At half-past four, twenty-one rather dispirited candidates filed from  the room.    \"Well, thank goodness it's over! I never want to write another word in  my life. My hand's stiff with cramp!\" exclaimed the girl with the red  hair-ribbon to a sympathetic audience in the passage.    \"It was awful! I didn't answer half the questions. My swastika isn't  worth its salt. I shall give it away!\" mourned the owner of the mascot.    \"They expected us to know so very much; we should be absolute  encyclopaedias if we had all that pat off at our fingers' ends!\" sighed  the girl with the fair pigtail.    \"How did you get on?\" Winona asked the ruddy-haired girl, who was wiping  her spectacles nervously.    \"Oh, I don't know. It's so hard to tell. I answered most of the  questions, but of course I can't say whether they're right or wrong.  Wasn't the Latin translation just too horrible? I yearned for a  dictionary. And some of the French grammar questions were absolute  catches!\"    \"We went on too long,\" said Winona. \"It would have been much better to  spread the exam, over two days.\"    \"Do you think so? I'd rather have 'sudden death' myself. It's such a  relief to feel it's finished. It would be wretched to have to begin  again to-morrow. I hardly slept a wink last night for thinking about it.
