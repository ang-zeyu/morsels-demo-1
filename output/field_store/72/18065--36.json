II Here we have a fancy lattice of three strands of laid wool couched  with small French knots at the intersecting points, the outline is in  stem stitch and fanciful back stitches are used as fillings.    III Has first rows of long single threads thrown across, caught down  with stars and groups of satin stitching crossed.    IV A light treatment for stems, the filling, shells in buttonhole  stitches, with second outline in darning.    V One of the examples of the introduction of lace stitches that is to be  noted in work of the late 17th century, the alternate blocks are in  basket stitch, the others in double cross stitch in contrasting colours.    VI Quaint example of couched work.    [Illustration: PLATE 18]      PLATE 19    A collection of particularly beautiful fillings seen in a Georgian copy  of a very old example.    I Has double rows of outline stitch, framing spaces filled with stars in  back stitch, the centre being solid in shading stitch.    II Outline of rope stitch and cross trellis of the same. Stars of back  stitch couched down with contrasting wools.    III Part of a beautiful stem, outline of chain bars of button stitch in  double wool and spots in loop stitch.    IV The two small petals filled solid with stem stitch, three rows of  which are used for outlining the long petal, the centre being filled  with rings in buttonhole stitch and darned background.    V Is carried out in satin and stem stitch, with back stitch bars couched  with contrasting wool.    [Illustration: PLATE 19]          Op. VIII    PLATE 20      These two sketches were taken from an 18th century (?) curtain done in  solid crewel work, in somewhat bright colouring. The brown veining which  occurs in I and in nearly all the leaves was most effective; in this  plate is also shown a good example of basket stitch stem work. The acorn  cup was worked in close French knots.    II The large leaf is a good example of solid work. The contour was in  stem stitch, the serrated edges turned over on to the brown surface were  in shading stitch, the red veinings in satin stitch.    [Illustration: PLATE 20]      PLATE 21    These two leaves are of a bold, simple character that is easy to  suggest, and proves a great relief in a design that is somewhat  over-detailed. The large one is carried out in browns and greens. The  turned over serrated edge is in satin stitch of graduating shade. The  heavy veining is somewhat unusual in that it is carried out in laid  stitch, dark green in the centre and light green outside. The stars are  worked in dark green. The outline to the lower leaf is in two shades of  green, the palest continuing to outline the remainder of the large leaf.    The small leaf is worked solid in shading stitch in blue with brown  satin stitch edge, the veining is brown as is also the contour of the  upper point.    [Illustration: PLATE 21]      PLATE 22    We have here a large leaf very characteristic of the complicated detail  introduced by the conventional treatment of foliage in early English  work.    The curved point of the leaf is outlined in rope stitch in a dark shade  of soft bronze green, the heavy double cross lines are in crewel stitch  and of a lighter shade of bronze in which the square lattice is also  carried out, the French knots in the centres are of a dark olive green.    The round medallion is outlined similarly to the above but in darker  shade, the centre being worked solid in slanting satin stitches set in  rows, each row taken at the opposite angle to its neighbour; the next  leaf is outlined inside, in two rows of chain, the turnover of the leaf  being solid satin stitch in three shades of green. The stem is double  back stitch, and the other leaves are worked solid in shading stitch in  graduated shades of green.    The two small leaves, I & II example: 1st, rope stitch with alternate  fillings of darning and outline stitch, and 2nd, rows of outline stitch  for one-half the back leaves and one-half grey knot stitch and blue  snail trail in alternative, the end leaf being in rows of outline of  brown colour.    [Illustration: PLATE 22]      PLATE 23    A portion of the terra firma of the curtain.    The strawberries and clear parts of the ground are worked in French  knots.    The plants are very useful in breaking up the solid masses of dark  colour, and the stag serves to introduce into the base of the work the  colouring of the acorns above (on plates 1 and 2).    As a rule this base of a design repeats all the colourings used  throughout.    [Illustration: PLATE 23]      PLATE 24    Example of a bird introduced into the late 17th century work.    It is executed in simple feather stitch for the tail feathers and satin  stitch very evenly shaded. The dark centres of the short feathers are in  crimson, the rest in shades of buff, the breast feathers also worked in  satin stitch are in putty colour, legs and beak are brown and the crest  in crimson.    [Illustration: PLATE 24]      PLATE 25    Quaint early example of a parrot, head in knot stitch, breast feathers  block stitch, and wings in shaded single feather stitching.    The butterfly and grub are found in all early examples.    [Illustration: PLATE 25]      PLATE 26    Group of animals usually disporting on the terra-firma at base of large  designs.    Worked always in long and short stitch.

They had  proved their right to be considered among the most formidable soldiers  the world has known. Against the brown rock of that host in khaki, the  flower of German savagery and courage had broken at Chateau-Thierry.  There the high tide of Prussian militarism, after what had seemed to be  an irresistible dash for the destruction of France, spent itself in the  bloody froth and spume of bitter defeat. There the Prussian Guard  encountered the Marines, the Iron Division and the other heroic  organizations of America's new army. There German soldiers who had been  hardened and trained under German conscription before the war, and who  had learned new arts in their bloody trade, through their service in the  World War, met their masters in young Americans taken from the shop, the  field, and the forge, youths who had been sent into battle with a scant  six months' intensive training in the art of war. Not only did these  American soldiers hold the German onslaught where it was but, in a  sudden, fierce, resistless counter-thrust they drove back in defeat and  confusion the Prussian Guard, the Pommeranian Reserves, and smashed the  morale of that German division beyond hope of resurrection.    The news of that exploit sped from the Alps to the North Sea Coast,  through all the camps of the Allies, with incredible rapidity. \"The  Americans have held the Germans. They can fight,\" ran the message. New  life came into the war-weary ranks of heroic poilus and into the  steel-hard armies of Great Britain. \"The Americans are as good as the  best. There are millions of them, and millions more are coming,\" was  heard on every side. The transfusion of American blood came as magic  tonic, and from that glorious day there was never a doubt as to the  speedy defeat of Germany. From that day the German retreat dated. The  armistice signed on November 11, 1918, was merely the period finishing  the death sentence of German militarism, the first word of which was  uttered at Chateau-Thierry.    Germany's defiance to the world, her determination to force her will and  her \"kultur\" upon the democracies of earth, produced the conflict. She  called to her aid three sister autocracies: Turkey, a land ruled by the  whims of a long line of moody misanthropic monarchs; Bulgaria, the  traitor nation cast by its Teutonic king into a war in which its people  had no choice and little sympathy; Austria-Hungary, a congeries of races  in which a Teutonic minority ruled with an iron scepter.    Against this phalanx of autocracy, twenty-four nations arrayed  themselves. Populations of these twenty-eight warring nations far  exceeded the total population of all the remainder of humanity. The  conflagration of war literally belted the earth. It consumed the most  civilized of capitals. It raged in the swamps and forests of Africa. To  its call came alien peoples speaking words that none but themselves  could translate, wearing garments of exotic cut and hue amid the smart  garbs and sober hues of modern civilization. A twentieth century Babel  came to the fields of France for freedom's sake, and there was born an  internationalism making for the future understanding and peace of the  world.

Never before in the history of the world were so many races and peoples  mingled in a military effort as those that came together under the  command of Marshal Foch. If we divide the human races into white,  yellow, red and black, all four were largely represented. Among the  white races there were Frenchmen, Italians, Portuguese, English,  Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Canadians, Australians, South Africans (of both  British and Dutch descent) New Zealanders; in the American army,  probably every other European nation was represented, with additional  contingents from those already named, so that every branch of the white  race figured in the ethnological total.    There were representatives of many Asiatic races, including not only the  volunteers from the native states of India, but elements from the French  colony in Cochin China, with Annam, Cambodia, Tonkin, Laos, and Kwang  Chau Wan. England and France both contributed many African tribes,  including Arabs from Algeria and Tunis, Senegalese, Saharans, and many  of the South African races. The red races of North America were  represented in the armies of both Canada and the United States, while  the Maoris, Samoans, and other Polynesian races were likewise  represented. And as, in the American Army, there were men of German,  Austrian, and Hungarian descent, and, in all probability, contingents  also of Bulgarian and Turkish blood, it may be said that Foch commanded  an army representing the whole human race, united in defense of the  ideals of the Allies.    It will be seen that more than ten times the number of neutral persons  were engulfed in the maelstrom of war. Millions of these suffered from  it during the entire period of the conflict, four years three months and  fifteen days, a total of 1,567 days. For almost four years Germany  rolled up a record of victories on land and of piracies on and under the  seas.    [Illustration: TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE ALLIES UNDER THE ARMISTICE OF  NOVEMBER 11, 1918 (East/West: Brussels to Berlin; North South: Keil to  Bern)]    Dotted area, invaded territory of Belgium, France, Luxembourg and    Alsace-Lorraine to be evacuated in fourteen days; area in small    squares, part of Germany west of the Rhine to be evacuated in    twenty-five days and occupied by Allied and U. S. troops; lightly    shaded area to east of Rhine, neutral zone; black semi-circles    bridge-heads of thirty kilometers radius in the neutral zone to be    occupied by Allied armies.      Little by little, day after day, piracies dwindled as the murderous  submarine was mastered and its menace strangled. On the land, the  Allies, under the matchless leadership of Marshal Ferdinand Foch and the  generous co-operation of Americans, British, French and Italians, under  the great Generals Pershing, Haig, Petain and Diaz, wrested the  initiative from von Hindenburg and Ludendorf, late in July, 1918. Then,  in one hundred and fifteen days of wonderful strategy and the fiercest  fighting the world has ever witnessed, Foch and the Allies closed upon  the Germanic armies the jaws of a steel trap. A series of brilliant  maneuvers dating from the battle of Chateau-Thierry in which the  Americans checked the Teutonic rush, resulted in the defeat and rout on  all the fronts of the Teutonic commands.    In that titanic effort, America's share was that of the final deciding  factor. A nation unjustly titled the \"Dollar Nation,\" believed by  Germany and by other countries to be soft, selfish and wasteful, became  over night hard as tempered steel, self-sacrificing with an altruism  that inspired the world and thrifty beyond all precedent in order that  not only its own armies but the armies of the Allies might be fed and  munitioned.    Leading American thought and American action, President Wilson stood out  as the prophet of the democracies of the world. Not only did he inspire  America and the Allies to a military and naval effort beyond precedent,  but he inspired the civilian populations of the world to extraordinary  effort, efforts that eventually won the war. For the decision was gained  quite as certainly on the wheat fields of Western America, in the shops  and the mines and the homes of America as it was upon the battle-field.    This effort came in response to the following appeal by the President:      These, then, are the things we must do, and do well, besides  fighting--the things without which mere fighting would be fruitless:    We must supply abundant food for ourselves and for our armies and our  seamen not only, but also for a large part of the nations with whom we  have now made common cause, in whose support and by whose sides we shall  be fighting;    We must supply ships by the hundreds out of our shipyards to carry to  the other side of the sea, submarines or no submarines, what will every  day be needed there; and--    Abundant materials out of our fields and our mines and our factories  with which not only to clothe and equip our own forces on land and sea  but also to clothe and support our"]]]
