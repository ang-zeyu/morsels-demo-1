The collegiate system was in no sense of the word monastic, indeed it was  to a certain extent established to counteract monastic influence; but it  is absurd to suppose that the younger communities would borrow nothing  from the elder--especially when we reflect that the monastic system had  completed at least seven centuries of successful existence before Walter  de Merton was moved to found a college; that many of the subsequent  founders of colleges were churchmen, if not actually monks; and that there  were monastic colleges at both Universities. Further, as we have seen that  study was specially enjoined upon the monks by S. Benedict, it is  precisely in the direction of study that we should expect to find common  features in the two sets of communities. And this, in fact, is what came  to pass. An examination of the statutes affecting the library in the codes  imposed upon the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge shews that their  provisions were borrowed directly from the monastic Customs. The  resemblances are too striking to be accidental. Take, for instance, this  clause, from the statutes of Oriel College, Oxford, dated 1329:        The common books (_communes libri_) of the House are to be      brought out and inspected once a year, on the feast of the      Commemoration of Souls [2 November], in presence of the      Provost or his deputy, and of the Scholars [Fellows].        Every one of them in turn, in order of seniority, may select a      single book which either treats of the science to which he is      devoting himself, or which he requires for his use. This he      may keep until the same festival in the succeeding year, when      a similar selection of books is to take place, and so on, from      year to year. If there should happen to be more books than      persons, those that remain are to be selected in the same      manner.    Bishop Bateman--who had been educated in the priory at Norwich, and whose  brother was an abbot--gave statutes to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1350,  with similar provisions, and the addition that certain books \"are to  remain continuously in the library-chamber, fastened with iron chains, for  the common use of the Fellows.\" These were copied by Wykeham at New  College, Oxford, but with extended provisions for lending books to  students, and a direction that all the books \"which remain unassigned  after the Fellows have made their selection are to be fastened with iron  chains, and remain for ever in the common Library.\" This statute was  repeated at King's College, Cambridge, and at several colleges in Oxford.    Let me now remind you of Archbishop Lanfranc's statute for English  Benedictines, dated 1070, which was based, as he himself tells us, on the  general monastic practice of his time:        On the Monday after the first Sunday in Lent, before brethren      come into the Chapter House, the librarian (_custos librorum_)      shall have had a carpet laid down, and all the books got      together upon it, except those which a year previously had      been assigned for reading. These brethren are to bring with      them, when they come into the Chapter House, each his book in      his hand....        Then the librarian shall read a statement as to the manner in      which brethren have had books during the past year. As each      brother hears his name pronounced he is to give back the book      which had been entrusted to him for reading; and he whose      conscience accuses him of not having read the book through      which he had received, is to fall on his face, confess his      fault, and entreat forgiveness.        The librarian shall then make a fresh distribution of books,      namely, a different volume to each brother for his reading.    You will agree with me, I feel sure, that this statute, or similar  provisions extracted from other regulations, is the source of the  collegiate provisions for an annual audit and distribution of books; while  the reservation of the undistributed volumes, and their chaining for  common use in a library, was in accordance with the unwritten practice of  the monasteries. This being the case I think that we are justified in  assuming that the internal fittings of the libraries would be identical  also; and it must be further remembered that both collegiate and monastic  libraries were being fitted up during the same period, the fifteenth  century.    When books were first placed in a separate room, fastened with iron  chains, for the use of the Fellows of a college or the monks of a convent,  the piece of furniture used was, I take it, an elongated lectern or desk,  of a convenient height for a seated reader to use. The books lay on their  sides on the desk, and were attached by chains to a horizontal bar above  it. There were at least two libraries in this University fitted with such  desks, at the colleges of Pembroke and Queens'; and that it was a common  form abroad is proved by its appearance in a French translation of the  first book of the _Consolations of Philosophy_ of Boethius, which I  lately found in the British Museum[1], executed towards the end of the  fifteenth century (fig. 1).    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Interior of a library: from a MS. of a French  translation of the first book of the _Consolations of Philosophy_ of  Boethius.]    One example at least of these fittings still exists, in the library  attached to the church of S. Wallberg, at Zutphen in Holland. This library  was built in its present position in 1555, but I suspect that some of the  fittings, those namely which are more richly ornamented, were removed from  an earlier library. Each of these desks is 9 feet long by 5 feet 6 inches  high; and, as you will see directly, a man can sit and read at them very  conveniently. I shall shew you first a general view of part of the library  (fig. 2); and, secondly, a single desk (fig. 3).    Such cases as these must have been in use at the Sorbonne, where a library  was first established in 1289 for books chained for the common convenience  of the Fellows (_in communem sociorum utilitatem_). A description of this  library, based probably on records now lost, has been given by Claude  Hemere (Librarian 1638-1643) in his MS. history. This I proceed to  translate:    [Illustration: FIG. 3. Desk in the library at Zutphen: from a photograph.]        The old library was contained under one roof. It was firmly      and solidly built, and was 120 feet long by 36 feet broad.      Further, that it might be the more safe from the danger of      being burnt, should any house in the neighbourhood catch      fire, there was a sufficient interval between it and every      dwelling-house. Each side was pierced with 19 windows of equal      size, that plenty of daylight both from the east and the west      (for this was the direction of the room) might fall upon the      desks, and fill the whole length and breadth of the library.      There were 28 desks, marked with the letters of the alphabet,      five feet high, and so arranged that they were separated by a      moderate interval. They were loaded with books, all of which      were chained, that no sacrilegious hand might [carry them off.      These chains were attached to the right-hand board of every      book] so that they might be readily thrown aside, and reading      not be interfered with. Moreover the volumes could be opened      and shut without difficulty. A reader who sat down in the      space between two desks, as they rose to a height of five feet      as I said above, neither saw nor disturbed any one else who      might be reading or writing in another place by talking or by      any other interruption, unless the other student wished it, or      paid attention to any question that might be put to him. It      was required, by the ancient rules of the library, that      reading, writing, and handling of books should go forward in      complete silence.    This system must have been very wasteful as regards space; for only a few  volumes, say a couple of dozen, could be accommodated on a single desk. As  books accumulated therefore some other form of case had to be devised,  which would accommodate more volumes than could be consulted at once. The  desk could not be dispensed with so long as books were chained, but one or  more shelves were added to it. This addition was effected in two ways,  according as the books were to stand on their ends, or to lie on their  sides.    As an illustration of the former plan I will take the library of Merton  College, Oxford, attributed by tradition to William Reade, Bishop of  Chichester 1368-85; and it has been so little altered that it may be taken  as a type of a medieval collegiate or monastic library. It is a long  narrow room, as all medieval libraries were, with equidistant windows, and  the bookcases stand at right angles to the walls in the spaces between  each pair of windows, in front of which is the seat for the reader. Each  bookcase had originally two shelves only above the desk. I will shew you,  first, a general view of the interior of this library, and then a single  bookcase and seat.      _Merton College, Oxford: (1) general view of the interior of the Library;  (2) a single bookcase as at present._      The system of chaining, as adopted in this country, would allow of the  books being readily taken down from the shelves, and laid on the desk for  reading. One end of the chain was attached to the middle of the upper edge  of the right-hand board; the other to a ring which played on a bar set in  front of the shelf on which the book stood. The fore-edge of the books,  not the back, was turned forwards. A swivel, usually in the middle of the  chain, prevented tangling. The chains varied in length according to the  distance of the shelf from the desk. The bar was kept in place by a rather  elaborate system of iron-work attached to the end of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19420"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of York (#4)"],[1,"built a castle in York,  at the junction of the Ouse and the Foss, and garrisoned it with  Normans. He then returned southwards. So soon as his back was turned,  the city revolted again and besieged the castle. But William was soon  upon them. He took and plundered the city, and erected another fortress  on Beacon Hill. In 1069 occurred the final rebellion. A Danish fleet  sailed up the Humber under Edgar, Gospatric, and Waltheof. This last  calamity is said to have killed Ealdred, the archbishop. He had  endeavoured to make peace between conquerors and conquered, and he saw  that now a desperate struggle was inevitable. The whole of Northumbria  rose as the Danes made their way up the Ouse. The Norman garrisons in  York set fire to the houses near them, and the whole city was burnt  down. The minster was either wholly or partially destroyed. On the site  of William's fort at Beacon Hill there have lately been discovered  several deposits of silver pennies of the earliest coinage of William.  These were probably hidden there by the Norman garrison. After a  desperate sortie, these forts were taken. Thereupon the Danes sailed  away with their plunder, and the revolt suddenly came to an end. But  William swore an oath of vengeance. He caught and destroyed a number of  the Danes in Lincolnshire. When he reached York he found it deserted. He  repaired his castles, and then proceeded to make an example of the  country round. His vengeance was so thorough that for nine years  afterwards the land between York and Durham was untilled. He returned to  York to keep Christmas. It is not too much to say that the north of  England took centuries to recover from his vengeance. The famous library  of York, which was destroyed in the fire, deserves a few words of  mention. It was a fine example of the educational work of the Saxon  Church. Under Egbert, and at the instigation of Bede, was founded the  University of York, which soon grew to great importance. Alcuin was its  chief ornament, and gave lessons there in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. The  library was formed in connection with this university, and a list of the  books in it, made by Alcuin himself, has come down to us. They consist  chiefly of the Fathers and of the later Latin poets, with a few books on  philosophy and grammar.    [Illustration: Bootham Bar.]    Thomas of Bayeux, the first Norman archbishop, found everything at York  in ruin and confusion. The minster and its outlying buildings, the  library, and the university were destroyed, and only one of three canons  remained in residence. He increased the number of these, and appointed a  dean--there had not been one at York before--and otherwise changed the  constitution of the minster. He further appointed a chancellor, or  _magister scholarum_, in charge of all schools within ten miles of York.  Among these was the Grammar School in the city, which still survives and  flourishes, under the name of St. Peter's School. In the nave of the  minster there is a window known as the Chancellor's Window, and  containing a representation of Robert Riplingham, a chancellor of the  fourteenth century, lecturing to his pupils. The library was never fully  replaced. The books at the time of the Reformation were few, and were  kept in a building close to the entrance to the south transept of the  minster, and now used as the archbishop's registry. This building was  erected in 1415. Most of these books are still preserved. In due course  Thomas rebuilt the minster, or part of it, on a modest scale. In his  episcopate the struggle for supremacy with Canterbury really began.  Thomas refused to make submission to Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury;  but Lanfranc represented to the king that the supremacy of Canterbury  was necessary as a bond of union between the south and the north. Thomas  was at last compelled to submit to Lanfranc himself, though he made  reservations with regard to his successors. In 1072 Worcester, and soon  after Lindsey and Lincoln, were taken from the see of York. The abbeys  of Selby and St. Oswald in Gloucester were given to the archbishop by  way of some return. Meanwhile the archbishops of York also claimed  supremacy over the northern bishops of the Isles and Scotland. They  certainly visited and consecrated in these dioceses. After many  quarrels, these pretensions were finally disposed of at Rome. In 1154  the sees of Man and Orkney were placed under the Archbishop of  Drontheim, and in 1188 the whole Scottish Church was released from any  subjection to York and placed under the direct control of the Pope. Only  one Scottish prelate, the Bishop of Whithorn, remained a suffragan to  York, but in the fourteenth century Whithorn also was lost to the  archbishops, and became a part of the Scottish Church.    The Bishop of Durham remained nominally in subjection to the see of  York, but in reality he was often a greater man than his superior. In  1134 the Bishopric of Carlisle was founded and placed under the  authority of the archbishops. Sodor and Man afterwards fell again under  his jurisdiction, and in 1542 the diocese of Chester was founded. The  archbishop has now authority over nine bishoprics. But to return to  Thomas. In 1071 he went with Lanfranc to Rome to receive the pall. The  question of precedence was there argued, and the Pope decided in favour  of Canterbury. Afterwards, at a synod held by William, it was decided  that the Archbishop of York should swear allegiance to Canterbury, and  must be consecrated in Canterbury Cathedral, that the diocese of York  from that time should not extend south of the Humber, and that the  archbishop should lose his authority over the see of Worcester. On the  death of Lanfranc, however, the dispute broke out again. For four years  there was a vacancy to the see of Canterbury; Anselm, the new  archbishop, was consecrated by Thomas, who took the opportunity to  insist that Anselm should not be styled Primate of all England. The  quarrel with Canterbury remained in abeyance until Thurstan was  appointed Archbishop of York (1114 A.D.). He refused to make submission  to Canterbury, and the Archbishop of Canterbury was determined not to  consecrate him until he submitted. There was, therefore, a deadlock.  Thurstan had the support of the Pope, but he was not consecrated until  1119, when the Pope Calixtus himself performed the ceremony at Rheims.  Thurstan obtained a Bull from the Pope releasing him and his successors  for ever from supremacy of Canterbury, and for a time York was  triumphant.    In the reign of Henry II. the quarrel again broke out. This time the  Archbishop of York, Roger Pont L'Eveque, the builder of the Norman choir  of the minster, had the support of the king, who was engaged in the  struggle with Becket. Roger, indeed, has been bitterly reviled as an  accessory to the murder of Becket. He carried on the quarrel with  Richard of Canterbury, Becket's successor, and at the Council of  Westminster (1176 A.D.) the rivalries of the two prelates came to a head  in a ridiculous scene. The papal legate was present at the council, and  the Archbishop of Canterbury seated himself at his right hand. Shortly  afterwards entered the Archbishop of York, who, refusing to take a lower  place, sat down in the lap of Canterbury. He was seized, beaten, and  kicked for his pains.    [Illustration: Walmgate Bar.]    In 1190 the people of York, incited by the priests, rose and massacred  the Jews, killing nearly 500. For this they were fined by the king. The  minster contributed to the ransom of Richard I., pawning a golden cross  which Roger had given. The cross was afterwards redeemed.    Roger was succeeded, after an interval of ten years, by Geoffrey, the  bastard son of Henry II. He quarrelled continually with John, who on one  occasion fined the city of York L100 for omitting to meet him when he  visited the city.    In the war between Henry III. and the barons, the archbishops Gray and  Gifford took the part of the king, and owing to their efforts their  diocese was little affected by the struggle.    In 1265 a quarrel broke out between the Abbey of St. Mary and the  townspeople, owing to the abuse of the privilege of sanctuary possessed  by the convent. Much blood was shed, and the suburb of Bootham was burnt  down.    In the reign of Edward I. York played a great part in the history of  England, as the king made it his capital during the war with Scotland.  He was present at the installation of St. William's relics in the choir,  and in 1297 he held a great Parliament there. The archbishops and clergy  contributed one-fifth of their income to the expenses of the war. The  Courts of the Exchequer and King's Bench were also removed from London  to York, and remained there for seven years.    At this time York was a more important city than it has been at any  period since the Roman occupation. It was both the civil and military  capital of England, and its archbishops and prebendaries had great  power. It was also, naturally, a period of great building activity. In a  hundred and fifty years the whole fabric of the minster, as it now is,  was erected.    Edward II. also spent much of his time at York, and in 1318 another  Parliament met there. After Bannockburn the Scots made continual inroads  into Yorkshire. In 1319 an army of Scots, 15,000 in number, advanced to  the very gates of York. Melton, the archbishop, hastily got together  10,000 men and fell in with the Scots at Myton, on the Swale, where he  was utterly routed, and narrowly escaped with his life. This battle was  known in derision as the Chapter of Myton.    The quarrel between York and Canterbury was not finally settled until  the time of John of Thoresby. He was one of the most remarkable of the  archbishops of York. When he was made archbishop (1352) the diocese,  owing to the Scottish inroads, the black death, and other causes, stood  in great need of reform. Anarchy and"]]]
