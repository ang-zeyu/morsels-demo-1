Don't dare to speak  again, sir, till you're spoken to, or you will be punished.\"    This tirade greatly surprised me.  I had been quite pleased with myself  for remembering all Mrs Hudson's directions, and so intent on relieving  my mind of them, that I had not noticed the growing rage of the middle-  aged Henniker.  In after years, when this story was told of me, I got  the credit of being the only human being, who all by himself, had  succeeded in \"fetching\" the Stonebridge housekeeper.  At present,  however, I was taken aback by her evident rage, and considered it  prudent to give heed to her admonition.  The unpacking was presently  finished, and the scarlet in the Henniker's face had gradually toned  down to its normal tint, when, turning to me, she silently motioned me  to follow her.  I did so, along a long passage, in which there were at  least two turnings.  At the end of this was a door leading into a room  containing half a dozen beds.  Not a very cheerful room--long and low  and badly lighted, with only two washstands, and a rather fusty flavour  about the bedclothes.  Don't suppose, at my age, I was critical on such  points; but when I take my boy to school, I do not think, with what I  know now, I shall put him anywhere where the dormitory is like that of  Stonebridge House.    \"That,\" said Miss Henniker, pointing to one of the beds, \"is your bed,  and you wash at this washstand.\"    \"Oh,\" said I, again forgetting myself; \"you are to be sure my brush and  comb--\"    \"Silence, Batchelor!\" once more reiterated Miss Henniker.    From the dormitory I was conducted to the schoolroom, and from the  schoolroom to the dining-room, and from the dining-room to the boot-  room, and my duties were explained in each.    It was in the latter apartment that I first made the acquaintance of one  of my fellow \"troublesome or backwards.\"    A biggish boy was adopting the novel expedient for getting on a tight  boot of turning his back to the wall and kicking out at it like a horse  when I and my conductress entered.    The latter very nearly came in for one of the kicks.    \"Flanagan,\" said she, \"that is not allowed.  I shall give you a bad mark  for it.\"    Flanagan went on kicking till the end of the sentence, and then subsided  ruefully, and said, \"The bothering thing won't come on or off, please,  ma'am.  It won't come on with shoving.\"    \"If your boots are too small,\" replied the lady, solemnly, begging the  question, \"you must write home for new ones.\"    \"But the bothering things--\"    \"Batchelor,\" said Miss Henniker, turning to me, \"this is the boot-room,  where you will have to put on and take off your boots whenever you go  out or come in.  This boy is going out, and will take you into the  playground with him,\" and away she went, leaving me in the hands of the  volatile Flanagan.    \"Who are you?\" he demanded.    It was a horribly dark place, this boot-room, and I could scarcely see  who it was who was questioning me.  He seemed to be a big boy, a year or  two older than myself, with a face which, as far as I could make it out,  was not altogether unpleasant.  He continued stamping with his  refractory boots all the time he was talking to me, letting out  occasionally behind, in spite of Miss Henniker.    \"Who are you?  What's your name?\" he said.    \"Fred Batchelor,\" I replied, deferentially.    \"Batchelor, eh?  Are you a backward or a troublesome, eh?\"    This was a poser.  I had never put the question to myself, and was  wholly at a loss how to answer.  I told Flanagan so.    \"Oh, but you're _bound_ to know!\" he exclaimed.  \"What did they send you  here for, eh?\"    Whereupon I was drawn out to narrate, greatly to Flanagan's  satisfaction, the affair of Cad Prog and his baby sister.    \"Hurrah!\" said he, when I had done.  \"Hurrah, you're a troublesome!  That makes seven troublesomes, and only two backwards!\" and in his  jubilation he gave a specially vigorous kick out behind, and finally  drove the obstinate boot home.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"there was no end of discussion about it.  I was afraid  you were a backward, that I was!  If the other new fellow's only a  troublesome too, we shall have it all to ourselves.  Philpot, you know,\"  added he confidentially, \"is a backward by rights, but he calls himself  one of us because of the Tuesday night jams.\"    \"Is there another new boy too?\"  I inquired, plucking up heart with this  friendly comrade.    \"Oh! he's coming to-morrow.  Never mind!  Even if he's a `back' it don't  matter, except for the glory of the thing!  The `troubs' were always  ahead all Ladislaw's time, and he's no chicken.  I say, come in the  playground, can't you?\"    I followed rather nervously.  A new boy never takes all at once to his  first walk in the playground; but with Flanagan as my protector--who was  \"Hail fellow, well met,\" with every one, even the backwards--I got  through the ordeal pretty easily.    There were eight boys altogether at Stonebridge House, and I was  introduced--or rather exhibited--to most of them that afternoon.  Some  received me roughly and others indifferently.  The verdict, on the  whole, seemed to be that there was plenty of time to see what sort of a  fellow I was, and for the present the less I was made to think of myself  the better.  So they all talked rather loud in my presence, and showed  off, as boys will do; and each expected--or, at any rate, attempted--to  impress me with a sense of his particular importance.    This treatment gave me time to make observations as well as them, and  before the afternoon ended I had a pretty good idea whom I liked and  whom I did not like at Stonebridge House.    Presently we were summoned in to a bread-and-cheese supper, with cold  water, and shortly afterwards ordered off to bed.  I said my prayers  before I went to sleep, as I had promised good Mrs Hudson, and, except  for being shouted at to mind I did not snore or talk in my sleep--the  punishment for which crimes was something terrific--I was allowed to go  to sleep in peace, very lonely at heart, and with a good deal of secret  trepidation as I looked forward and wondered what would be my lot at  Stonebridge House.        CHAPTER THREE.    HOW A MYSTERIOUS NEW BOY CAME TO STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.    When I rose next morning, and proceeded to take my turn at the  washstand, and array my person in the travel-stained garments of the  previous day, it seemed ages since I had parted with Brownstroke and  entered the gloomy precincts of Stonebridge House.    Everything and everybody around me was gloomy.  Even Flanagan seemed not  yet to have got up the steam; and as for the other boys--they skulked  morosely through the process of dressing, and hardly uttered a word.  It  was a beautiful day outside; the sun was lighting up the fields, and the  birds were singing merrily in the trees; but somehow or other the good  cheer didn't seem to penetrate inside the walls of Stonebridge House.    I tried to get up a conversation with Flanagan, but he looked half-  frightened and half guilty as I did so.    \"I say,\" said I, \"couldn't we open the window and let some fresh air  in?\"    (Mrs Hudson had always been strong on fresh air.)    \"Look-out, I say,\" said Flanagan, in a frightened whisper; \"you'll get  us all in a row!\"    \"In a row?\"  I replied.  \"Who with?\"    \"Why, old Hen; but shut up, do you hear?\" and here he dipped his face in  the basin, and so effectually ended the talk.    This was quite a revelation to me.  Get in a row with Miss Henniker for  speaking to one of my schoolfellows in the dormitory!  A lively prospect  and no mistake.    Presently a bell rang, and we all wended our way down stairs into the  parlour where I had yesterday enjoyed my _tete-a-tete_ with Miss  Henniker.  Here we found that lady standing majestically in the middle  of the room, like a general about to review a regiment.    \"Show nails!\" she ejaculated, as soon as all were assembled.    This mysterious mandate was the signal for each boy passing before her,  exhibiting, as he did so, his hands.    As I was last in the procession I had time to watch the effect of this  proceeding.  \"Showing nails,\" as I afterwards found out, was a very old-  established rule at Stonebridge House, and one under which every  generation of \"backward and troublesome boys\" who resided there had  groaned.  If any boy's hands or nails were, in the opinion of Miss  Henniker, unclean or untidy, he received a bad mark, and was at once  dismissed to the dormitory to remedy the defect.    One or two in front of me suffered thus, and a glance down at my own  extremities made me a little doubtful as to my fate.  I did what I could  with them privately, but their appearance was not much improved.    At last I stood for inspection before the dreadful Henniker.    \"Your hands are dirty, Batchelor.  A bad mark.  Go and wash them.\"    The bad mark, whatever it might mean, appeared to me very unjust.  Had I  known the rule, it would have been different, but how was I to know,  when no one had told me?    \"Please, ma'am, I didn't--\"    \"Two bad marks for talking!\" was my only reply, and off I slunk, feeling  rather crushed, to the dormitory.    I found Flanagan scrubbing at our basin.    \"Ah,\" said he, \"I thought you'd get potted.\"    \"I think it's a shame,\" said I.    \"Look-out, I say,\" exclaimed Flanagan, skipping away as if he'd been  shot, and resuming his wash at the other basin.    Presently he came back on tip-toe, and whispered, \"Why can't you talk  lower, you young muff?\"    \"Surely she can't hear, here up stairs?\"    \"Can't she?  That's all you know!  She hears every word you say all over  the place, I tell you.\"    I went on \"hard all\" at the nail-brush for a minute or "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#4)"],[1,"be able to get  a job as groom, stableman, or even under-gamekeeper.  But none of those  things is good enough for me; I am capable of better things than  grooming horses, cleaning harness, or looking after pheasants; I want  employment that will bring me in good money, and I mean to have it too.\"    \"That's right, Dick; that's the way to talk,\" returned Humphreys  approvingly.  \"Modesty is all right, a very desirable and admirable  quality in every young man's character, and one which is seen far too  seldom nowadays.  Modesty, however, is one thing, and self-depreciation  quite another.  It is a mistake for anyone to underrate his own value,  and, as you very truly say, you are capable of doing much better work  than that needed in either of the occupations that you have named;  therefore you are justified in insisting upon having it.  A man has a  perfect right to the very best and most profitable work he is capable of  doing; but he must get it for himself; it is no use for him to sit down  supinely and demand that Providence shall put it into his hands.  The  man who is worth his salt will get up and `hustle'--as the Americans  tersely express it--and not rest until he has secured what he wants.  Now, you, my boy, are very heavily handicapped.  You have neither money  nor influence to help you to what you want, therefore you will have to  depend upon `hustle' and grit alone; also you have no time to waste in  looking about in this country for the kind of thing you want, which,  even with all the `hustle' and grit imaginable, may take you months, or  even years, to find.  No, as you said at the beginning of this  conversation, you must go somewhere abroad to get what you want; and in  a foreign land you may find even such despised accomplishments as  riding, swimming, and straight shooting of the utmost value to you.  But  in my opinion your mainstay must be the medical and surgical knowledge  which you have acquired.  Now, whereabout on the face of this old globe  of ours are you likely to be able to employ your knowledge to the best  and most profitable account?  It should be where wealth is abundant, and  where medical and surgical skill is pretty frequently in demand, also  where there is plenty of scope for a young fellow who, like yourself, is  imbued with the spirit of adventure.  Now, let me consider for a  moment--where is the country which most nearly answers to these  conditions?  What do you say to South Africa?  It is the land of gold  and diamonds; it is not, I believe, overrun with medical men; and as to  adventure--\" Humphreys shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands  abroad expressively.    Dick's eyes sparkled and his face lit up with enthusiasm.    \"South Africa is the place for me, without a doubt,\" he exclaimed with  animation.  \"It is, as you say, rich; it is also a land of unbounded  possibilities; and-- But how am I to get there?  The passage money  amounts to something considerable, and I have no money to spare for that  sort of thing; also, as I have said, I will not take a penny from the  Mater.\"    \"What about borrowing?\" suggested Humphreys.  \"As you know, Dick, I am  not a rich man, but I have no doubt I could manage to--\"    \"No!\" interrupted Dick emphatically; \"a thousand times no.  It is like  you, Doctor, to offer to help me out of your own exceedingly limited  means, and I am more grateful to you than I have words to express; but I  simply will not avail myself of your kindness, or that of anybody else  indeed, for I should be starting with a millstone of debt hanging round  my neck.  No, I have thought of a better way than that; I will work my  passage out.\"    \"Work your passage out!\" ejaculated the Doctor, staggered, in spite of  his whole-hearted belief in the virtues of self-help, at this bold  suggestion on Dick's part.  \"In what capacity, pray?\"    \"Oh, as anything!\" returned Dick buoyantly; \"as ordinary seaman, cook's  mate, stoker--what does it matter?  I will find a way, never fear.  I'll  take a trot round the docks to-morrow, and it will be strange indeed if  I cannot somewhere find a market for my labour.  Why, even the  elementary knowledge of nautical matters that I have acquired in sailing  my little single-handed cutter during holiday time will be of service to  me.  I can steer, I can box the compass, I know the name of every sail  on a full-rigged ship; and I will guarantee that before I have been  forty-eight hours out I will know the function of every bit of running  rigging, and where to lay my hand upon it in the dark.\"    \"Ay, I'll bet that you will, Dick,\" answered Humphreys, with enthusiasm  as great as Dick's own.  \"And I have not much doubt as to your being  able to get a berth as ordinary seaman; for you are a big strong fellow,  and for mere pulling and hauling purposes any skipper ought to be glad  to get hold of you.  Yes, I think we may consider that part of your  problem solved.  But what about after your arrival in South Africa?  How  do you propose to proceed at the end of the voyage when you have safely  landed?  For you must remember that in all probability you will have no  wages to draw; people who work their passages are usually shipped at the  princely rate of pay of one shilling per month.\"    \"Yes, I know,\" said Dick.  \"Still, I shall have reached the scene of my  great endeavour without cost, and that is the important thing.  After  that I shall of course be obliged to trust to my own push and `hustle',  as you call it, for it is impossible to make any definite plans at this  distance from the scene of operations.\"    \"Quite so,\" agreed Humphreys.  \"And you must also remember that there is  always the element of luck, or chance, or whatever you please to call  it, in the background, and to be watched for.  Opportunity often  presents itself literally at a moment's notice and in the most  unexpected fashion, and the one who profits by it is he who is alert  enough to seize it as it passes.  But there is one thing you must do,  Dick; you must take with you a well-stocked chest of drugs, as well as  your case of surgical instruments; and, since you will not let me lend  you any money to help you on your way, you must allow me to make you a  present of that medicine chest just as a token of my appreciation of the  way in which you have conducted yourself as my pupil-- Nay, boy, you  must not refuse me, for if you do I shall be deeply hurt as well as  seriously offended.\"    \"Very well, then,\" acquiesced Dick, \"since you put it in that way, and  so very strongly, I will accept your generous gift with a thousand most  hearty thanks, not only for the gift itself, but also for the kindly  feeling that prompts it.\"    \"My dear Dick,\" protested Humphreys, \"there is really no reason at all  why you should feel so extraordinarily grateful, for in doing what I  propose to do I shall only be very inadequately repaying you for much  valuable assistance rendered, and much very pleasant companionship  during the time of your pupilage with me.  And do not think that because  I have not expressed much voluble regret at this abrupt severance of our  connection I do not feel it, for I do very keenly, I assure you; but I  see quite clearly that the thing is inevitable, therefore to complain  about it would be both useless and foolish.    \"Now, there is one other way in which I can help you; and when I have  explained to you how tremendous is the power which I propose to place in  your hands you will understand, more clearly than I could show you in  any other way, the absolute trust that I repose in you.  For I tell you  this, Dick, in all sincerity, there is not another person in the whole  circle of my acquaintance--and it is pretty wide--whom I feel I could  safely trust with this power, so potent is it for evil as well as good.  But I am convinced that I can trust you; and that is why I have  determined to endow you with the ability to perform deeds which to many  people will seem positively miraculous.    \"You have often expressed amazement at the uniform success which attends  my treatment of even my most difficult cases, both medical and surgical,  but especially the surgical; and I know, from the remarks you have made,  that you attribute those successes purely to the extent of my knowledge.  Well, of course, knowledge has something to do with it; but the true  secret of my success lies in the free use which I make of hypnotism.  Yes, no doubt you are surprised; for you have never seen me employ any  of the well-known methods of the ordinary hypnotist.  Very true.  But my  method is not the ordinary method at all; it is one which I claim as my  own exclusive discovery, and it is as far in advance of ordinary  hypnotism as that is in advance of the methods of the stage hypnotist.    \"Almost at the outset of my professional career I directed my attention  to the investigation of hypnotism, determined to ascertain whether or  not there was anything in the claims set up by its exponents; and I soon  discovered that there was something in it, despite the disrepute cast  upon it by the grotesque performances of certain so-called entertainers.  There is no need for me to detail to you the successive steps by which  I at length attained my present knowledge of the marvellous powers of  the science.  Let it suffice me to say that by diligent study of it I  eventually acquired such a mastery of it that it has enabled me to--  well, to put it mildly--succeed where but for it I must have failed.  And a large measure of this success is due to the fact that I have  discovered an infallible method of instantly hypnotising a patient  without that patient's knowledge.  They are hypnotised, but they don't  know it; haven't the remotest suspicion of it.  Then I convey to them a  powerful suggestion that my treatment of them is going to be absolutely  successful, and--there you have the whole secret.\"    Humphreys paused for a moment, as if"]]]
