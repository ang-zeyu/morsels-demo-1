[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18931"],[0,"Archeological Investigations (#4)"],[1,"objects exhumed are uniform in character from top  to bottom; the specimens found on the clay or solid rock floor are of  the same class as those barely covered by the surface earth. Moreover,  when they cease to appear they cease absolutely; the rock was swept  bare, or the clay was deposited, by the stream to which the cave owes  its existence, and each is a part of the original formation. In these  circumstances habitation would be out of the question.    By careful search in the caves and rock-shelters of which the Indian  known to history availed himself, extensive and interesting museum  collections can be made. To find an earlier man it will be necessary  to investigate caverns which he found suitable for occupancy and in  which the accumulation of detritus, from whatever source, has been  sufficient to cover his remains so deeply that they can not be  confused with those of a later period; and it may be necessary, also,  to discover with them bones of extinct animals. Should such a place  exist, it is extremely probable that there will be no outward  indication of the fact.    No examination of a cavern is complete or is to be deemed satisfactory  unless a depth is reached where the geological deposits are  undeniably of such age as to antedate the possible appearance of man  upon the scene. This is not assured until the excavation has reached  the original floor, which may be either the bed-rock or the clay left  by the eroding stream when its volume had become so diminished from  any cause that it was no longer able to keep its channel cleared out.  Unless a cave is almost perfectly dry--and few of them are--the bottom  can not be reached until all standing or soil water has been drained  off.    Notwithstanding the most explicit directions, a stranger without a  guide is frequently unable to find a cave unless its position is  plainly visible from some well-defined spot. The winding valleys and  the multitude of ravines sometimes bewilder even those living among  them.    A few definitions of terms, or explanations of statements in the  report, may prevent misunderstanding.    \"Refuse,\" \"signs,\" \"indications,\" \"evidence,\" referring to habitation  or occupancy, mean mussel shells; animal bones; burned or worked  stones; broken pottery; wrought objects of bone or shell; flint  implements, chips, or spalls; ashes; charcoal; in short, the material  ordinarily found on the site of an Indian village, some or all of  which are to be seen where the caverns have been used for shelter.    \"Daylight\" or \"in daylight\" is the greatest distance within the  entrance to a cavern at which common print may be easily read or the  nature of small objects lying on the floor determined with certainty.    \"Drip rock,\" \"cave rock,\" or \"cave formation\" are general terms  including stalactite or stalagmite; also deposits of similar origin  coating the walls. Not all of these may be present in the same cavern.    \"Roof dust\" is a substance, literally \"lime sand,\" produced by the  superficial disintegration of the roof or walls. This process is  greatly accelerated where lichen or rock moss has gained a root hold  on the stone. Roof dust in a dry cavern is the equivalent of  stalagmite in a wet one.    \"Cave earth\" is the loose, loamy material usually found in the front  chambers of large caverns. It is made up of roof dust, sand, and silt  washed from the interior, outside dust and vegetable matter blown in  by the wind, with minute amounts of clay or soil carried in by  animals.    \"Gravel\" in a cavern is seldom noticeably water-worn, but is the  angular debris resulting from the continued fragmentation of chert  nodules released by erosion of the limestone.    A \"rock shelter,\" or \"shelter cave,\" is a room or recess formed by  atmospheric erosion in the face, usually at the base, of a cliff. The  depth from front to back, under the projecting or overhanging  unremoved bedrock above, is generally much less than the length as  measured along the face of the bluff. They are nearly always dry, more  or less protected from storms, and when of suitable size and in a  favorable location were much used as camping places. They are rather  rare in limestone formations but frequent in massive sandstone.    \"House mounds\" are small, low piles of earth, similar in all respects  to those so numerous in southeastern Missouri and southward. Although  they are usually described as \"standing in regular rows,\" they are in  fact irregularly placed, though seldom as much as 100 feet apart in  the same group.    Measurements of caverns explored were made with a tape line; others  were estimated by stepping, or in the case of elevations, by sighting,  consequently are only approximate, but the figures given will in no  case exceed the actual distance.    Specimens reported from caves not excavated were found on the floor,  sometimes in situations where no addition of cave earth had taken  place since the objects were left there; at other times where they  were brought from below by burrowing animals; and, again, where they  are exposed in the bed or banks of a drainage channel.    In no cave so far examined has any evidence been found to show that  the aborigines occupied any part of it beyond such point as was  adequately illuminated from the entrance. No doubt they may, at times,  have retreated beyond the reach of daylight and been compelled to  dispel the darkness by means of fires; but such instances were rare  and of short duration. Statements are sometimes made that specimens,  usually flint implements, have been found far, possibly several  hundred yards, within the cavern. Such objects do not predicate  habitation at that distance; primitive explorers may have lost them.  It has been pointed out, too, by Mr. De Lancey Gill, that a wounded  animal, taking refuge in a cave and instinctively seeking its dark  recesses, may carry in an arrow or spear whose point remains when the  shaft has decayed. In the case of a large mammal, such as a bear or a  panther, a number of arrow or spear heads might be carried in and be  found close together long after the death of the victim.    Cairns or stone-covered graves are of common occurrence; but with a  single exception the rocks in all those visited or reported are more  or less displaced. This is due to hunters digging out small wild  animals making a den in them; to treasure seekers who believe that  \"money\" is concealed in them; and most of all to persons who are  curious to know \"what there is in there.\"    The record of the investigations will be given by counties, beginning  at the south and proceeding northward. Descriptions and notes of the  sites mentioned will follow as closely as possible the same  arrangement. A number following the name of a cave refers to its  position as denoted by a corresponding number on the map (pl. 3).      THE UPPER CURRENT RIVER    A number of well-known caverns, some of them quite extensive, exist  along the head streams forming the Current River. As originally  planned, the work included a thorough survey of this region, but owing  to various causes it was only partially examined. Several large caves  were reported as being along the river and its tributaries farther  down than these researches were carried. Notable is one opposite the  mouth of Sinkin Creek, which was described as dry and very large  within; but it was also stated that it can only be entered through a  sink hole with the aid of a ladder or pole 30 feet long. Such a cave  is not likely to have been used for shelter. Others, as they were  described, seemed equally unfitted for this purpose. The only  exception to this general rule is one in Spring Valley south of the  Current and east of Sinkin.    Such as were visited will be described in their geographical order.                        *    *    *      SHANNON COUNTY    BAT CAVE (1)    This cavern is 6 miles above the mouth of Sinkin. It is near the top  of a cliff, fully 300 feet above the river. The entrance is 30 feet  wide and 10 feet high; within is a level earth-covered floor. Being  very difficult of access, it was probably never inhabited.      BLUE SPRING, OR FISHING CAVE (1)    This is situated on the Terrell land, 4 miles below Akers post office.  The entrance, 10 feet high and 20 feet wide, is almost at low-water  level; the river at flood height rises fully 20 feet above its top.  Fifty feet within is a spring or well, 20 feet across, whose bottom is  beyond the reach of a line 60 feet long. It is said that eyeless fish  of 3 pounds weight have been caught in this \"Blue Spring.\"      WELCH'S CAVE    This is 4 miles below Cedar Grove. It can be entered only in a boat,  and the entire floor is deeply covered with soft mud.      BIG CREEK CAVE    There is a cave at the mouth of Big Creek which is often used as a  temporary camping place by hunters and fishermen. The water enters  it whenever there is a freshet in either the creek or the river; so it  could never have served as a place of permanent abode.        [Illustration: PLATE 3: MAP OF AREA EXAMINED    (Numbers refer to corresponding numbers in text)]                        *    *    *      TEXAS COUNTY    SMITH CAVES (2)    On James I. Smith's land, on Big Creek, a mile above Niles, are three  caves. One is merely a round opening 5 feet in width and height, soon  narrowing to a crevice; it would not be mentioned except that in it  was a sandstone slab such as mortars are made of. This bore no marks  of use; but it had been carried in for some purpose--possibly by white  men.    The second cave, 50 feet from the first, has an entrance 20 feet wide  and 4 to 5 feet high. Dry earth extends back for 40 feet; then come  clay and fallen rocks, sloping downward toward the rear. The roof  maintains its level as far as followed. No trace of occupation could  be found.    The third cave, 150 yards from the second, has an entrance 35 feet  wide and 20 feet high. Dry cave earth "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18932"],[0,"Mental Defectives and Sexual Offenders (#4)"],[1,"45,000,000, or nearly  one-half of the whole population, will never develop mental capacity  beyond the stage represented by a normal twelve-year-old child; that  only 13,500,000 will ever show superior intelligence; and that only  4,500,000 can be considered \"talented.\" \"Still more alarming,\" the  author continues, \"is the prospect of the future. The overwhelming  weight of evidence indicates that the A and B elements in America are  barely reproducing themselves, while the other elements are increasing  at rates proportionate to their decreasing intellectual capacity; in  other words, that intelligence is to-day being steadily bred out of the  American population.\"    The biologist Davenport calculated that at present rates of reproduction  1,000 Harvard graduates of to-day would have only fifty descendants two  centuries hence, whereas 1,000 Roumanians to-day in Boston, at their  present rate of breeding, would have 100,000 descendants in the same  space of time.    Mr. Lothrop Stoddart emphatically scouts the view which is occasionally  put forward to the effect that genius is a form of insanity, and that  therefore one ought to be careful about discouraging the marriage even  of epileptics and mentally unbalanced persons for fear a possible  Napoleon or Julius Caesar or Beethoven should be lost to the world.  \"Careful scientific investigation,\" he says, \"has clearly disproved this  notion. For one thing, elaborate statistical studies of eminent persons  have shown them to be less liable to insanity than the general  population. Of course, a considerable number of eminent men can be  listed who unquestionably suffered from various neuropathic traits. But  it was not those traits that made them eminent; on the contrary, these  were handicaps. Somewhere back in their ancestry a taint was introduced  into a sound superior strain, and produced this disharmonic combination  of qualities.\"      SECTION 2.--HEREDITY _V._ ENVIRONMENT.    The Committee feel bound to refer to the great strides made during the  last half-century towards establishing laws and theories of genetics and  heredity. Unfortunately, terms such as the \"integrity of the germ plasm\"  and \"the Mendelian law,\" while marking great advances in biological  thought and science, have become too much associated in the public mind  with a depressing and fatalistic notion that heredity determines  everything and that environment can play but a very insignificant part  in human evolution, development, and progress--physical, mental, or  moral. Such, of course, is not the case.    In ultimate origin all evolution and all heredity are the outcome,  summation, and expression of the effects of environmental influences,  acting on the whole organism under certain laws of transmission. The  laws of heredity, though as yet only partially determined, are already  sufficiently ascertained to prove for practical purposes that, in order  to promote integration and further progress in human evolution--not  disintegration and degeneration--two things are essential and  complementary. On the one hand, we must do everything possible in the  direction of improving the nutrition, health, conditions of life, and  habits of the community; and, on the other hand, we must promote and  encourage parenthood on the part of the best and stablest stocks, and do  everything in our power to discourage, or in the extreme cases even to  prevent, proliferation of unfit and degenerate strains.    For the purpose of the present inquiry we need merely state as a  practical preliminary regarding heredity that it has been proved beyond  question that if two feeble-minded persons marry they will most probably  produce abundant offspring, of whom all may be subnormal, and a large  proportion will become a burden on the State; and that if one such  person is mated with a healthy individual an undue proportion of their  children are likely to prove degenerate or defective, and the  unsoundness will continue to make its appearance in succeeding  generations.    While local evidence confirmatory of this came before the Committee,  first place will be given to certain classic and exhaustive  investigations and life-histories of degenerate families, going back  many generations, such as no young country could possibly supply.  However, the forcible and far-sighted report of the late Dr. Duncan  Macgregor (originally Professor of Mental Science at Otago University,  and subsequently Inspector-General of Asylums, Hospitals, and Charitable  Aid), quoted in the Appendix, shows clearly that some very degenerate  stocks imported into this country under the active immigration policy of  the \"seventies\" and \"eighties\" were already threatening, thirty-five  years ago, to become a serious tax on the country, as well as tending to  lower the high physical, mental, and moral standard established by the  original pioneers and settlers.    We shall now revert for the moment to the environmental factor. The  first most pressing and immediate practical duty of the Government and  the community is to spare no pains to improve the status and environment  of the family so as to promote the highest attainable standard of  physical, mental, and moral health for the new generation--already in  our midst or bound to arrive in the course of the next few years.    It is becoming more and more widely recognized that by due attention to  the pre-natal and post-natal care of mother and child an infinity of  good can be done--indeed, a great deal is already under way in this  direction throughout the Dominion. But the Committee are satisfied that  much more ought to be done to ensure for children of the pre-school and  school ages more generally favourable home conditions, and healthier  environment and habits outside the home.    In the meantime it is obvious that very little can be effected in the  way of bettering the average heredity; but are we taking adequate  measures in the direction of improving the environment of mother and  child? The housing problem is still far from satisfactory; help in the  home can scarcely be procured, and the rearing and care of children  throughout the pre-school and school periods, in a large proportion of  cases, is neither conducive to a high standard of nutrition, growth, and  moral development, nor to the establishment of normal self-control,  especially as regards sexual habits and manifestations. The Committee  cannot ignore the fact that the leading medical and psychological  authorities lay it down as an axiom that the power of self-control is at  its highest when the individual is physically active, well-nourished,  and in perfect bodily health, and that impaired control always  accompanies impaired nutrition, debility, and disease. It has been said,  with profound wisdom and insight, that ultimately and fundamentally  reproduction should be regarded as essentially \"an exuberant phase of  nutrition\"; and there is no escaping the wide implication of Schiller's  aphorism that \"Love and Hunger rule the World.\"    In view of these considerations the Committee feel compelled to refer to  such serious handicaps to all-round health, control, and efficiency as  the prevalence of wrong feeding habits--_e.g._, giving children food  between meals and the insufficient provision of fresh fruit and  vegetables in the daily diet and the abuse of sweets. Other prominent  and avoidable handicaps, seriously affecting many children throughout  the Dominion, which ought to receive more serious attention are  insufficiency of sunlight and fresh air in the home and at school,  insufficient daily outing and exercise, lack of adequate provision in  the way of playgrounds and swimming-baths, and last, but not least, the  highly injurious practice of frequenting \"picture-shows.\"    As the Committee are called on to deal specially with the problem of  increasing manifestations of sexual depravity they cannot pass by the  fact that in the course of the last twenty years the younger members of  the community have been spending a steadily increasing proportion of  their time, during the most impressionable period of life, in what are  liable to prove forcing-houses of sexual precocity and criminal  tendencies. There is every reason for regarding the habit of \"going to  the pictures\" without adequate restrictions as contributing seriously to  precocious sexuality, and also to weakening the powers of inhibition and  self-control in other directions--powers which are the distinctive  attributes of the higher human being.    Alongside these considerations, the bodily harm done to the young by  frequently spending their afternoons and evenings in hot, stuffy,  overcrowded halls shrinks into insignificance, though serious enough in  itself.    The Committee endorses the opinions expressed by Education authorities,  and by practically every organization throughout the Dominion concerned  with the welfare of children, upon the harmful effect of moving-picture  shows as at present conducted. The Committee sympathizes with proposals  for reform along the following lines:--        (1.) Stricter censorship, not only of films, but of picture      posters, handbills, and advertisements.        (2.) Regulations as to the age of admission for children when      unaccompanied by a responsible adult, and to such pictures as      are not pronounced by the Censor as suitable for children.        (3.) Proper safeguards for the morals of children and young      persons within picture-theatres, including adequate      supervision of the premises.    The Committee desire it to be clearly understood that in this report  they have not particularly dealt with mental disabilities resulting from  diseases such as syphilis, or toxic influences such as alcohol, drugs,  &c. These questions have already been covered to some extent by the  Report of the Venereal Diseases Committee, and in any case would involve  too wide a field of"]]]
