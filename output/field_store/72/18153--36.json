Naturalists tell us that a full grown man  is a resultant or representative of all animated nature on this globe;  beginning with the early embryo state, then representing the lowest  forms of organic life, [4] and passing through every subordinate grade  or type, until he reaches the last and highest--manhood. In like manner,  and to the fullest extent, has Frederick Douglass passed through every  gradation of rank comprised in our national make-up, and bears upon his  person and upon his soul every thing that is American. And he has not  only full sympathy with every thing American; his proclivity or bent,  to active toil and visible progress, are in the strictly national  direction, delighting to outstrip \"all creation.\"    Nor have the natural gifts, already named as his, lost anything by his  severe training. When unexcited, his mental processes are probably slow,  but singularly clear in perception, and wide in vision, the unfailing  memory bringing up all the facts in their every aspect; incongruities  he lays hold of incontinently, and holds up on the edge of his keen and  telling wit. But this wit never descends to frivolity; it is rigidly  in the keeping of his truthful common sense, and always used in  illustration or proof of some point which could not so readily be  reached any other way. \"Beware of a Yankee when he is feeding,\" is a  shaft that strikes home{15} in a matter never so laid bare by satire  before. \"The Garrisonian views of disunion, if carried to a successful  issue, would only place the people of the north in the same relation  to American slavery which they now bear to the slavery of Cuba or the  Brazils,\" is a statement, in a few words, which contains the result and  the evidence of an argument which might cover pages, but could not carry  stronger conviction, nor be stated in less pregnable form. In proof  of this, I may say, that having been submitted to the attention of the  Garrisonians in print, in March, it was repeated before them at their  business meeting in May--the platform, _par excellence_, on which they  invite free fight, _a l'outrance_, to all comers. It was given out in  the clear, ringing tones, wherewith the hall of shields was wont to  resound of old, yet neither Garrison, nor Phillips, nor May, nor Remond,  nor Foster, nor Burleigh, with his subtle steel of \"the ice brook's  temper,\" ventured to break a lance upon it! The doctrine of the  dissolution of the Union, as a means for the abolition of American  slavery, was silenced upon the lips that gave it birth, and in the  presence of an array of defenders who compose the keenest intellects in  the land.    _\"The man who is right is a majority\"_ is an aphorism struck out by  Mr. Douglass in that great gathering of the friends of freedom, at  Pittsburgh, in 1852, where he towered among the highest, because, with  abilities inferior to none, and moved more deeply than any, there was  neither policy nor party to trammel the outpourings of his soul. Thus  we find, opposed to all disadvantages which a black man in the United  States labors and struggles under, is this one vantage ground--when the  chance comes, and the audience where he may have a say, he stands forth  the freest, most deeply moved and most earnest of all men.    It has been said of Mr. Douglass, that his descriptive and declamatory  powers, admitted to be of the very highest order, take precedence of  his logical force. Whilst the schools might have trained him to  the exhibition of the formulas of deductive{16} logic, nature and  circumstances forced him into the exercise of the higher faculties  required by induction. The first ninety pages of this \"Life in Bondage,\"  afford specimens of observing, comparing, and careful classifying,  of such superior character, that it is difficult to believe them the  results of a child's thinking; he questions the earth, and the children  and the slaves around him again and again, and finally looks to _\"God in  the sky\"_ for the why and the wherefore of the unnatural thing, slavery.  _\"Yes, if indeed thou art, wherefore dost thou suffer us to be slain?\"_  is the only prayer and worship of the God-forsaken Dodos in the heart of  Africa. Almost the same was his prayer. One of his earliest observations  was that white children should know their ages, while the colored  children were ignorant of theirs; and the songs of the slaves grated on  his inmost soul, because a something told him that harmony in sound, and  music of the spirit, could not consociate with miserable degradation.    To such a mind, the ordinary processes of logical deduction are like  proving that two and two make four. Mastering the intermediate steps  by an intuitive glance, or recurring to them as Ferguson resorted to  geometry, it goes down to the deeper relation of things, and brings out  what may seem, to some, mere statements, but which are new and brilliant  generalizations, each resting on a broad and stable basis. Thus, Chief  Justice Marshall gave his decisions, and then told Brother Story to look  up the authorities--and they never differed from him. Thus, also, in his  \"Lecture on the Anti-Slavery Movement,\" delivered before the Rochester  Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society, Mr. Douglass presents a mass of thought,  which, without any showy display of logic on his part, requires an  exercise of the reasoning faculties of the reader to keep pace with him.  And his \"Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered,\" is full of new  and fresh thoughts on the dawning science of race-history.    If, as has been stated, his intellection is slow, when unexcited, it is  most prompt and rapid when he is thoroughly aroused.{17} Memory, logic,  wit, sarcasm, invective pathos and bold imagery of rare structural  beauty, well up as from a copious fountain, yet each in its proper  place, and contributing to form a whole, grand in itself, yet complete  in the minutest proportions. It is most difficult to hedge him in a  corner, for his positions are taken so deliberately, that it is rare to  find a point in them undefended aforethought. Professor Reason tells me  the following: \"On a recent visit of a public nature, to Philadelphia,  and in a meeting composed mostly of his colored brethren, Mr. Douglass  proposed a comparison of views in the matters of the relations and  duties of 'our people;' he holding that prejudice was the result  of condition, and could be conquered by the efforts of the degraded  themselves. A gentleman present, distinguished for logical acumen and  subtlety, and who had devoted no small portion of the last twenty-five  years to the study and elucidation of this very question, held the  opposite view, that prejudice is innate and unconquerable. He terminated  a series of well dove-tailed, Socratic questions to Mr. Douglass,  with the following: 'If the legislature at Harrisburgh should awaken,  to-morrow morning, and find each man's skin turned black and his hair  woolly, what could they do to remove prejudice?' 'Immediately pass laws  entitling black men to all civil, political and social privileges,' was  the instant reply--and the questioning ceased.\"    The most remarkable mental phenomenon in Mr. Douglass, is his style in  writing and speaking. In March, 1855, he delivered an address in the  assembly chamber before the members of the legislature of the state of  New York. An eye witness [5] describes the crowded and most intelligent  audience, and their rapt attention to the speaker, as the grandest scene  he ever witnessed in the capitol. Among those whose eyes were riveted on  the speaker full two hours and a half, were Thurlow Weed and Lieutenant  Governor Raymond; the latter, at the conclusion of the address,  exclaimed to a friend, \"I would give twenty thousand dollars,{18} if I  could deliver that address in that manner.\" Mr. Raymond is a first class  graduate of Dartmouth, a rising politician, ranking foremost in the  legislature; of course, his ideal of oratory must be of the most  polished and finished description.    The style of Mr. Douglass in writing, is to me an intellectual puzzle.  The strength, affluence and terseness may easily be accounted for,  because the style of a man is the man; but how are we to account  for that rare polish in his style of writing, which, most critically  examined, seems the result of careful early culture among the best  classics of our language; it equals if it does not surpass the style of  Hugh Miller, which was the wonder of the British literary public, until  he unraveled the mystery in the most interesting of autobiographies. But  Frederick Douglass was still calking the seams of Baltimore clippers,  and had only written a \"pass,\" at the age when Miller's style was  already formed.    I asked William Whipper, of Pennsylvania, the gentleman alluded to  above, whether he thought Mr. Douglass's power inherited from the  Negroid, or from what is called the Caucasian side of his make up? After  some reflection, he frankly answered, \"I must admit, although sorry to  do so, that the Caucasian predominates.\" At that time, I almost agreed  with him; but, facts narrated in the first part of this work, throw a  different light on this interesting question.    We are left in the dark as to who was the paternal ancestor of our  author; a fact which generally holds good of the Romuluses and Remuses  who are to inaugurate the new birth of our republic. In the absence of  testimony from the Caucasian side, we must see what evidence is given on  the other side of the house.    \"My grandmother, though advanced in years, * * * was yet a woman of  power and spirit. She was marvelously straight in figure, elastic and  muscular.\" (p. 46.)    After describing her skill in constructing nets, her perseverance in  using them, and her wide-spread fame in the agricultural way he adds,  \"It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2020"],[0,"Tarzan the Terrible (#4)"],[1,"twenty feet the hybrid charged. Its rush was directed  toward the shaggy manlike ape who halted in his tracks with upraised  bludgeon to meet the assault. Tarzan, on the contrary, leaped forward  and with a celerity second not even to that of the swift-moving cat, he  threw himself headlong upon him as might a Rugby tackler on an American  gridiron. His right arm circled the beast's neck in front of the right  shoulder, his left behind the left foreleg, and so great was the force  of the impact that the two rolled over and over several times upon the  ground, the cat screaming and clawing to liberate itself that it might  turn upon its attacker, the man clinging desperately to his hold.    Seemingly the attack was one of mad, senseless ferocity unguided by  either reason or skill. Nothing, however, could have been farther from  the truth than such an assumption since every muscle in the ape-man's  giant frame obeyed the dictates of the cunning mind that long  experience had trained to meet every exigency of such an encounter. The  long, powerful legs, though seemingly inextricably entangled with the  hind feet of the clawing cat, ever as by a miracle, escaped the raking  talons and yet at just the proper instant in the midst of all the  rolling and tossing they were where they should be to carry out the  ape-man's plan of offense. So that on the instant that the cat believed  it had won the mastery of its antagonist it was jerked suddenly upward  as the ape-man rose to his feet, holding the striped back close against  his body as he rose and forcing it backward until it could but claw the  air helplessly.    Instantly the shaggy black rushed in with drawn knife which it buried  in the beast's heart. For a few moments Tarzan retained his hold but  when the body had relaxed in final dissolution he pushed it from him  and the two who had formerly been locked in mortal combat stood facing  each other across the body of the common foe.    Tarzan waited, ready either for peace or war. Presently two shaggy  black hands were raised; the left was laid upon its own heart and the  right extended until the palm touched Tarzan's breast. It was the same  form of friendly salutation with which the pithecanthropus had sealed  his alliance with the ape-man and Tarzan, glad of every ally he could  win in this strange and savage world, quickly accepted the proffered  friendship.    At the conclusion of the brief ceremony Tarzan, glancing in the  direction of the hairless pithecanthropus, discovered that the latter  had recovered consciousness and was sitting erect watching them  intently. He now rose slowly and at the same time the shaggy black  turned in his direction and addressed him in what evidently was their  common language. The hairless one replied and the two approached each  other slowly. Tarzan watched interestedly the outcome of their meeting.  They halted a few paces apart, first one and then the other speaking  rapidly but without apparent excitement, each occasionally glancing or  nodding toward Tarzan, indicating that he was to some extent the  subject of their conversation.    Presently they advanced again until they met, whereupon was repeated  the brief ceremony of alliance which had previously marked the  cessation of hostilities between Tarzan and the black.  They then  advanced toward the ape-man addressing him earnestly as though  endeavoring to convey to him some important information.  Presently,  however, they gave it up as an unprofitable job and, resorting to sign  language, conveyed to Tarzan that they were proceeding upon their way  together and were urging him to accompany them.    As the direction they indicated was a route which Tarzan had not  previously traversed he was extremely willing to accede to their  request, as he had determined thoroughly to explore this unknown land  before definitely abandoning search for Lady Jane therein.    For several days their way led through the foothills parallel to the  lofty range towering above. Often were they menaced by the savage  denizens of this remote fastness, and occasionally Tarzan glimpsed  weird forms of gigantic proportions amidst the shadows of the nights.    On the third day they came upon a large natural cave in the face of a  low cliff at the foot of which tumbled one of the numerous mountain  brooks that watered the plain below and fed the morasses in the  lowlands at the country's edge. Here the three took up their temporary  abode where Tarzan's instruction in the language of his companions  progressed more rapidly than while on the march.    The cave gave evidence of having harbored other manlike forms in the  past. Remnants of a crude, rock fireplace remained and the walls and  ceiling were blackened with the smoke of many fires. Scratched in the  soot, and sometimes deeply into the rock beneath, were strange  hieroglyphics and the outlines of beasts and birds and reptiles, some  of the latter of weird form suggesting the extinct creatures of  Jurassic times. Some of the more recently made hieroglyphics Tarzan's  companions read with interest and commented upon, and then with the  points of their knives they too added to the possibly age-old record of  the blackened walls.    Tarzan's curiosity was aroused, but the only explanation at which he  could arrive was that he was looking upon possibly the world's most  primitive hotel register. At least it gave him a further insight into  the development of the strange creatures with which Fate had thrown  him. Here were men with the tails of monkeys, one of them as hair  covered as any fur-bearing brute of the lower orders, and yet it was  evident that they possessed not only a spoken, but a written language.  The former he was slowly mastering and at this new evidence of  unlooked-for civilization in creatures possessing so many of the  physical attributes of beasts, Tarzan's curiosity was still further  piqued and his desire quickly to master their tongue strengthened, with  the result that he fell to with even greater assiduity to the task he  had set himself. Already he knew the names of his companions and the  common names of the fauna and flora with which they had most often come  in contact.    Ta-den, he of the hairless, white skin, having assumed the role of  tutor, prosecuted his task with a singleness of purpose that was  reflected in his pupil's rapid mastery of Ta-den's mother tongue.  Om-at, the hairy black, also seemed to feel that there rested upon his  broad shoulders a portion of the burden of responsibility for Tarzan's  education, with the result that either one or the other of them was  almost constantly coaching the ape-man during his waking hours. The  result was only what might have been expected--a rapid assimilation of  the teachings to the end that before any of them realized it,  communication by word of mouth became an accomplished fact.    Tarzan explained to his companions the purpose of his mission but  neither could give him any slightest thread of hope to weave into the  fabric of his longing. Never had there been in their country a woman  such as he described, nor any tailless man other than himself that they  ever had seen.    \"I have been gone from A-lur while Bu, the moon, has eaten seven  times,\" said Ta-den. \"Many things may happen in seven times  twenty-eight days; but I doubt that your woman could have entered our  country across the terrible morasses which even you found an almost  insurmountable obstacle, and if she had, could she have survived the  perils that you already have encountered beside those of which you have  yet to learn? Not even our own women venture into the savage lands  beyond the cities.\"    \"'A-lur,' Light-city, City of Light,\" mused Tarzan, translating the  word into his own tongue. \"And where is A-lur?\" he asked. \"Is it your  city, Ta-den, and Om-at's?\"    \"It is mine,\" replied the hairless one; \"but not Om-at's. The Waz-don  have no cities--they live in the trees of the forests and the caves of  the hills--is it not so, black man?\" he concluded, turning toward the  hairy giant beside him.    \"Yes,\" replied Om-at, \"We Waz-don are free--only the Hodon imprison  themselves in cities. I would not be a white man!\"    Tarzan smiled. Even here was the racial distinction between white man  and black man--Ho-don and Waz-don. Not even the fact that they appeared  to be equals in the matter of intelligence made any difference--one was  white and one was black, and it was easy to see that the white  considered himself superior to the other--one could see it in his quiet  smile.    \"Where is A-lur?\" Tarzan asked again. \"You are returning to it?\"    \"It is beyond the mountains,\" replied Ta-den. \"I do not return to  it--not yet. Not until Ko-tan is no more.\"    \"Ko-tan?\" queried Tarzan.    \"Ko-tan is king,\" explained the pithecanthropus. \"He rules this land. I  was one of his warriors. I lived in the palace of Ko-tan and there I  met O-lo-a, his daughter. We loved, Likestar-light, and I; but Ko-tan  would have none of me. He sent me away to fight with the men of the  village of Dak-at, who had refused to pay his tribute to the king,  thinking that I would be killed, for Dak-at is famous for his many fine  warriors. And I was not killed.  Instead I returned victorious with the  tribute and with Dak-at himself my prisoner; but Ko-tan was not pleased  because he saw that O-lo-a loved me even more than before, her love  being strengthened and fortified by pride in my achievement.    \"Powerful is my father, Ja-don, the Lion-man, chief of the largest  village outside of A-lur. Him Ko-tan hesitated to affront and so he  could not but praise me for my success, though he did it with half a  smile. But you do not understand! It is what we call a smile that moves  only the muscles of the face and affects not the light of the eyes--it  means hypocrisy and duplicity. I must be praised and rewarded. What  better than that he reward me with the hand"]]]
