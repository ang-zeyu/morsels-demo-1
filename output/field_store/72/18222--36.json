Thus I suppose the Sun to be the cause  of these things. He also is the cause in my opinion that the air in  these parts is dry, since he makes it so by scorching up his path  through the heaven: thus summer prevails always in the upper parts of  Libya. If however the station of the seasons had been changed, and where  now in the heaven are placed the North Wind and winter, there was the  station of the South Wind and of the midday, and where now is placed  the South Wind, there was the North, if this had been so, the Sun being  driven from the midst of the heaven by the winter and the North Wind  would go to the upper parts of Europe, just as now he comes to the upper  parts of Libya, and passing in his course throughout the whole of Europe  I suppose he would do to the Ister that which he now works upon the  Nile. As to the breeze, why none blows from the river, my opinion is  that from very hot places it is not natural that anything should blow,  and that a breeze is wont to blow from something cold.    Let these matters then be as they are and as they were at the first: but  as to the sources of the Nile, not one either of the Egyptians or of  the Libyans or of the Hellenes, who came to speech with me, professed to  know anything, except the scribe of the sacred treasury of Athene at the  city of Sais in Egypt. To me however this man seemed not to be speaking  seriously when he said that he had certain knowledge of it; and he said  as follows, namely that there were two mountains of which the tops ran  up to a sharp point, situated between the city of Syene, which is in  the district of Thebes, and Elephantine, and the names of the mountains  were, of the one Crophi and of the other Mophi. From the middle between  these mountains flowed (he said) the sources of the Nile, which were  fathomless in depth, and half of the water flowed to Egypt and towards  the North Wind, the other half to Ethiopia and the South Wind. As for  the fathomless depth of the source, he said that Psammetichos king of  Egypt came to a trial of this matter; for he had a rope twisted of many  thousand fathoms and let it down in this place, and it found no bottom.  By this the scribe (if this which he told was really as he said) gave me  to understand that there were certain strong eddies there and a backward  flow, and that since the water dashed against the mountains, therefore  the sounding-line could not come to any bottom when it was let down.  From no other person was I able to learn anything about this matter;  but for the rest I learnt so much as here follows by the most diligent  inquiry; for I went myself as an eye-witness as far as the city of  Elephantine and from that point onwards I gathered knowledge by report.  From the city of Elephantine as one goes up the river there is country  which slopes steeply; so that here one must attach ropes to the vessel  on both sides, as one fastens an ox, and so make one's way onward;  and if the rope break, the vessel is gone at once, carried away by the  violence of the stream. Through this country it is a voyage of about  four days in length, and in this part the Nile is winding like the river  Maiander, and the distance amounts to twelve _schoines_, which one must  traverse in this manner. Then you will come to a level plain, in which  the Nile flows round an island named Tachompso. (Now in the regions  above the Elephantine there dwell Ethiopians at once succeeding, who  also occupy half of the island, and Egyptians the other half.) Adjoining  this island there is a great lake, round which dwell Ethiopian nomad  tribes; and when you have sailed through this you will come to the  stream of the Nile again, which flows into this lake. After this you  will disembark and make a journey by land of forty days; for in the Nile  sharp rocks stand forth out of the water, and there are many reefs, by  which it is not possible for a vessel to pass. Then after having passed  through this country in the forty days which I have said, you will  embark again in another vessel and sail for twelve days; and after this  you will come to a great city called Meroe. This city is said to be  the mother-city of all the other Ethiopians: and they who dwell in it  reverence of the gods Zeus and Dionysos alone, and these they greatly  honour; and they have an Oracle of Zeus established, and make warlike  marches whensoever the god commands them by prophesyings and to  whatsoever place he commands. Sailing from this city you will come to  the \"Deserters\" in another period of time equal to that in which you  came from Elephantine to the mother-city of the Ethiopians. Now the  name of these \"Deserters\" is _Asmach_, and this word signifies, when  translated into the tongue of the Hellenes, \"those who stand on the left  hand of the king.\" These were two hundred and forty thousand Egyptians  of the warrior class, who revolted and went over to these Ethiopians for  the following cause:--In the reign of Psammetichos garrisons were set,  one towards the Ethiopians at the city of Elephantine, another towards  the Arabians and Assyrians at Daphnai of Pelusion, and another towards  Libya at Marea: and even in my own time the garrisons of the Persians  too are ordered in the same manner as these were in the reign of  Psammetichos, for both at Elephantine and at Daphnai the Persians have  outposts. The Egyptians then of whom I speak had served as outposts for  three years and no one relieved them from their guard; accordingly they  took counsel together, and adopting a common plan they all in a body  revolted from Psammetichos and set out for Ethiopia. Hearing this  Psammetichos set forth in pursuit, and when he came up with them he  entreated them much and endeavoured to persuade them not to desert the  gods of their country and their children and wives: upon which it is  said that one of them pointed to his privy member and said that wherever  this was, there would they have both children and wives. When these came  to Ethiopia they gave themselves over to the king of the Ethiopians; and  he rewarded them as follows:--there were certain of the Ethiopians who  had come to be at variance with him; and he bade them drive these out  and dwell in their land. So since these men settled in the land of  the Ethiopians, the Ethiopians have come to be of milder manners, from  having learnt the customs of the Egyptians.    The Nile then, besides the part of its course which is in Egypt, is  known as far as a four months' journey by river and land: for that is  the number of months which are found by reckoning to be spent in going  from Elephantine to these \"Deserters\": and the river runs from the West  and the setting of the sun. But what comes after that point no one can  clearly say; for this land is desert by reason of the burning heat. This  much however I heard from men of Kyrene, who told me that they had been  to the Oracle of Ammon, and had come to speech with Etearchos king of  the Ammonians: and it happened that after speaking of other matters they  fell to discourse about the Nile and how no one knew the sources of it;  and Etearchos said that once there came to him men of the Nasamonians  (this is a Libyan race which dwells in the Syrtis, and also in the land  to the East of the Syrtis reaching to no great distance), and when the  Nasamonians came and were asked by him whether they were able to tell  him anything more than he knew about the desert parts of Libya, they  said that there had been among them certain sons of chief men, who were  of unruly disposition; and these when they grew up to be men had devised  various other extravagant things and also they had told off by lot five  of themselves to go to see the desert parts of Libya and to try  whether they could discover more than those who had previously explored  furthest: for in those parts of Libya which are by the Northern Sea,  beginning from Egypt and going as far as the headland of Soloeis, which  is the extreme point of Libya, Libyans (and of them many races) extend  along the whole coast, except so much as the Hellenes and Phenicians  hold; but in the upper parts, which lie above the sea-coast and above  those people whose land comes down to the sea, Libya is full of wild  beasts; and in the parts above the land of wild beasts it is full of  sand, terribly waterless and utterly desert. These young men then (said  they), being sent out by their companions well furnished with supplies  of water and provisions, went first through the inhabited country, and  after they had passed through this they came to the country of wild  beasts, and after this they passed through the desert, making their  journey towards the West Wind; and having passed through a great tract  of sand in many days, they saw at last trees growing in a level place;  and having come up to them, they were beginning to pluck the fruit which  was upon the trees: but as they began to pluck it, there came upon them  small men, of less stature than men of the common size, and these seized  them and carried them away; and neither could the Nasamonians understand  anything of their speech nor could those who were carrying them off  understand anything of the speech of the Nasamonians; and they led them  (so it was said) through very great swamps, and after passing through  these they came to a city in which all the men were in size like those  who carried them off and in colour of skin black; and by the city ran  a great river, which ran from the West towards the sunrising, and in it  were seen crocodiles. Of the account given by Etearchos the Ammonian let  so much suffice as is here said, except that, as the men "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#4)"],[1," to review troops, he would wear grand  robes or a field-marshal's uniform.\"    \"But didn't he wear his crown?\"    \"No,\" cried Glyn, bursting out laughing.  \"That's only put on for a  little while when he's made king.\"    \"What does he do with it, then, at other times?\"    \"Nothing,\" cried Glyn merrily.  \"It's kept shut up in a glass case at  the Tower, for people to go and see.\"    \"England seems a queer place,\" said Singh quietly.    \"Very,\" cried Glyn drily.  \"You never want those Indian clothes, and you  ought to have done as I told you--left them behind.\"    \"But the Colonel didn't say so,\" replied the boy warmly.  \"He said that  some day he might take me with him to Court.  It was when I asked him  for the emeralds.\"    \"What do you mean--the belt?\" said Glyn quickly.    \"Yes.\"    \"You never told me that you had got them.\"    \"No; the Colonel said that I was not to make a fuss about them nor show  them to people, but keep them locked up in the case.  Here they are,\"  cried the boy; and, thrusting down one hand, he drew from beneath some  folded garments a small flat scarlet morocco case, which he opened by  pressing a spring, and drew out from where it lay neatly doubled, a  gold-embroidered waistbelt of some soft yellow leather, whose fastening  was formed of a gold clasp covered by a large flat emerald, two others  of similar shape being arranged so that when the belt was fastened round  the waist they lay on either side.  It was a magnificent piece of  ornamentation, but barbaric, and such as would be worn by an Indian  prince.    Apparently it was of great value, for the largest glittering green stone  was fully two inches in length and an inch and a half wide, the others  being about half the size, and all three engraved with lines of large  Arabic characters, so that either stone could have been utilised as a  gigantic seal.    \"I don't see why one shouldn't wear a thing like this,\" said Singh.  \"My  father always used to wear it out at home wherever he went, even when he  wore nothing else but a long white muslin robe.  On grand Court days he  would be covered with jewels, and his turban was full of diamonds.\"    \"Yes,\" said Glyn drily and with a half-contemptuous smile upon his lips;  \"but that was in India, where all the rajahs and princes wear such  things.\"    \"Well,\" said the boy proudly, \"I am still a maharajah, even if I have  come to England to be educated; so why shouldn't I put on a belt like  this on a grand day if I like?\"    Glyn took the brilliant belt from his companion's hand and held it  towards the light, inspecting curiously the beautiful gems, which were  of a lustrous green marked with flaws.    \"Ah,\" he said, \"it looks nice, and is worth a lot of money I suppose.\"    \"Of course,\" said the young Indian; and he added haughtily, \"I shouldn't  wear it if it were not.\"    \"Well, you can't wear it,\" said Glyn, passing the embroidered leather  through his hands and turning it over in the bright sunlight which came  through the window.    \"But why?\" cried Singh, frowning slightly at having his will challenged.    \"Well,\" said Glyn, \"first of all, as I told you, because the boys would  laugh at you.\"    \"They dare not,\" cried the boy proudly.    \"What!\" cried Glyn laughing.  \"Why, English boys dare do anything.  What  did Slegge say this morning?\"    \"Slegge is what you call a blackguard,\" cried Singh angrily.    \"Well, he isn't nice certainly,\" said Glyn; \"but he'd begin at you again  directly, and chaff, and say that you ought to ride on the elephant.\"    \"Well,\" said the boy, \"and that would be my place if there were a  howdah.  Of course I shouldn't ride on the great brute's neck.\"    \"Yes, in India; but can't you recollect that you are still in England?\"    \"Of course I can,\" cried the boy, with flashing eyes; \"but I can't  forget that I am a prince.\"    \"Now, look here,\" said Glyn, \"what did dad say to you when the Doctor  left us with him in the drawing-room?  I mean before father went away.  Have you forgotten?\"    \"Of course not.  He said, `Never mind about being a prince.  Be content  with the rank of an English gentleman till you go back to your own  country.'  And that's what I am going to do.\"    \"Well done,\" cried Glyn merrily.  \"Then, now, put this thing away; you  don't want it.  But stop a moment.  I never had a close look at it  before.\"    \"No; the Colonel told me to keep it locked up and not to go showing it  about so as to tempt some _budmash_ to steal it.\"    \"Well, we haven't got any _budmashes_ in England,\" said Glyn merrily, as  he began to inspect the emeralds again and took out his handkerchief to  rub off a finger-mark or two and make the gems send off scintillations  of sunlight which formed jack-o'-lanterns on the ceiling.  \"But we have  plenty of blackguards who would like to get a chance to carry it off.\"    \"What, among our schoolfellows?\" cried Singh hastily.    \"Bah!  No!  There, put it away.  But I should like to know what that  writing means.\"    \"It's out of the Koran,\" said the boy as he took the jewelled belt back  reverently and held it up to the light in turn.  \"It's very, very old,  and means greatness to my family.  It is a holy relic, and the  Maharajahs of Dour have worn that in turn for hundreds of years.\"    \"Well, you put it away,\" said Glyn; \"and I wouldn't show it to anybody  again, nor yet talk about it.  I wonder the dad let you have it.\"    \"Why?\" said Singh proudly.  \"It is mine.\"    \"Yes, of course; but it is not suited for a boy like you.\"    \"A boy like me!\" cried Singh half--angrily.  \"Why, I am as old as you.\"    \"Well, I know that; but my father doesn't give me emeralds and diamonds  to take with me to school.  He could, though, if he liked, for he's got  all those beautiful Indian jewels the Maharajah gave him.\"    \"Yes,\" said Singh, \"and that diamond--hilted tulwar.\"    \"Yes, that's a grand sword,\" cried Glyn, with his eyes sparkling.  \"I  should like to have that.\"    Singh laughed mockingly.    \"Why, you are as bad as I am,\" he cried.    \"That I am not!  Why, if I had it, do you think I should buckle it on to  go and see a country wild-beast show?\"    \"Well, no, I don't suppose you would,\" said Singh quietly, as he gravely  replaced the emeralds in their receptacle and curled the belt around  them before shutting down the velvet-lined and quilted cover with a loud  snap.  \"But some day, when we have both grown older, and we are back in  India--I mean when I am at home in state and you are one of my  officers--you will have to get the Colonel to let you wear it then.\"    \"Ah,\" said Glyn, slowly and thoughtfully, \"some day; but that's a long  time off.  I suppose I shall be a soldier like the dad is, and in your  army.\"    \"Why, of course,\" cried Singh.  \"You will be my greatest general, just  the same as your father was when mine was alive.  He was always a great  general there, though he was only colonel in the Company's army.  There,  I suppose you are right.  I like to look at that belt, but I won't show  it about; but I say, Glyn, I shall be glad when we get older and have  both begun learning to be--no, what do you call it?--not learning--I  mean, being taught to be soldiers.\"    \"Training,\" said Glyn.    \"Yes, training--that's it; and we shall go together to that place where  your father was, not far from London.  You know--the place he used to  talk to us about, where he was trained before he came out to India.\"    \"Addiscombe,\" said Glyn quietly, as he stood watching his companion  thrust the case back into the bottom of the portmanteau and rearrange  the garments he had moved, while his hand lingered for a few moments  about a soft white robe, which he covered over with a sigh before  closing the lid and turning the key of the great leather case.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"Addiscombe.  What stories he used to tell us about the  young officers there!  What did he call them?  I forget.\"    \"Cadets,\" said Glyn thoughtfully.    \"That's it.  I wish I didn't forget so many of those English words;  but,\" continued the boy, \"I liked it best when he told us about the  battles out at home, when all the chiefs around were fighting against my  father the Maharajah, so as to slay him and divide his possessions.  You  know, my father has talked about it to me as well--how he was so nearly  beaten and weakened, and so many of his bravest officers killed, that it  made him apply to the great Company for help, and they sent your father.  Oh, what a brave man he was!\"    \"Who said that?\" cried Glyn, flushing up.    \"My father the Maharajah.  He said so to me many times, and that he was  his best and truest friend.  Oh yes, I used to like to hear about it  all, and he used to tell me that the Colonel would always be my truest  friend as well, and that I was to love him and obey him, and always  believe that what he told me to do was right.  And I always do.\"    \"Of course you do,\" said Glyn flushing.  \"Yes, Singh, he is some one to  be proud of, isn't he?  But I am like you; I don't much like coming to  this school, though the Doctor is very nice and kind to us both.\"    \"Yes, I like him better than the masters,\" said Singh; \"but I don't like  the boys, and I don't think they like me.\"    \"Oh, wait a bit,\" said Glyn.  \"It's because everything seems so  different to being in India; but, as father says, there is such a lot  one ought to learn, and we shall get used to it by-and-by; only, I say,  you know what the dad said?\"    \"You mean about trying to be an English gentle man and leaving the  maharajah till I get back home?\"    \"Yes, that's it,\" cried Glyn eagerly.    \"Yes; but it's hard work, for everything is so different here, and the  boys are not like you.\"    \"Oh yes, they are,\" cried Glyn merrily; \"just the same.  Here, come on;  let's go down and see whether Wrench has put up those forms by the wall.  We want to see the show.\"    \"Yes,\" cried Singh.  \"It puts one in mind of Dour again, and I have been  thinking that we don't get"]]]
