[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#4)"],[1,"d!\" cried Cairn, leaping from the cab. \"My God! what has  happened?\"    A thousand fears, a thousand reproaches, flooded his brain with  frenzy. He went racing up to the steps and almost threw himself upon  the man who stood half-dressed in the doorway.    \"Felton, Felton!\" he whispered hoarsely. \"What has happened? Who--\"    \"Sir Michael, sir,\" answered the man. \"I thought\"--his voice  broke--\"you were the doctor, sir?\"    \"Miss Myra--\"    \"She fainted away, sir. Mrs. Hume is with her in the library, now.\"    Cairn thrust past the servant and ran into the library. The  housekeeper and a trembling maid were bending over Myra Duquesne, who  lay fully dressed, white and still, upon a Chesterfield. Cairn  unceremoniously grasped her wrist, dropped upon his knees and placed  his ear to the still breast.    \"Thank God!\" he said. \"It is only a swoon. Look after her, Mrs. Hume.\"    The housekeeper, with set face, lowered her head, but did not trust  herself to speak. Cairn went out into the hall and tapped Felton on  the shoulder. The man turned with a great start.    \"What happened?\" he demanded. \"Is Sir Michael--?\"    Felton nodded.    \"Five minutes before you came, sir.\" His voice was hoarse with  emotion. \"Miss Myra came out of her room. She thought someone called  her. She rapped on Mrs. Hume's door, and Mrs. Hume, who was just  retiring, opened it. She also thought she had heard someone calling  Miss Myra out on the stairhead.\"    \"Well?\"    \"There was no one there, sir. Everyone was in bed; I was just  undressing, myself. But there was a sort of faint perfume--something  like a church, only disgusting, sir--\"    \"How--disgusting! Did _you_ smell it?\"    \"No, sir, never. Mrs. Hume and Miss Myra have noticed it in the house  on other nights, and one of the maids, too. It was very strong, I'm  told, last night. Well, sir, as they stood by the door they heard a  horrid kind of choking scream. They both rushed to Sir Michael's  room, and--\"    \"Yes, yes?\"    \"He was lying half out of bed, sir--\"    \"Dead?\"    \"Seemed like he'd been strangled, they told me, and--\"    \"Who is with him now?\"    The man grew even paler.    \"No one, Mr. Cairn, sir. Miss Myra screamed out that there were two  hands just unfastening from his throat as she and Mrs. Hume got to the  door, and there was no living soul in the room, sir. I might as well  out with it! We're all afraid to go in!\"    Cairn turned and ran up the stairs. The upper landing was in darkness  and the door of the room which he knew to be Sir Michael's stood wide  open. As he entered, a faint scent came to his nostrils. It brought  him up short at the threshold, with a chill of supernatural dread.    The bed was placed between the windows, and one curtain had been  pulled aside, admitting a flood, of moonlight. Cairn remembered that  Myra had mentioned this circumstance in connection with the  disturbance of the previous night.    \"Who, in God's name, opened that curtain!\" he muttered.    Fully in the cold white light lay Sir Michael Ferrara, his silver hair  gleaming and his strong, angular face upturned to the intruding rays.  His glazed eyes were starting from their sockets; his face was nearly  black; and his fingers were clutching the sheets in a death grip.  Cairn had need of all his courage to touch him.    He was quite dead.    Someone was running up the stairs. Cairn turned, half dazed,  anticipating the entrance of a local medical man. Into the room ran  his father, switching on the light as he did so. A greyish tinge  showed through his ruddy complexion. He scarcely noticed his son.    \"Ferrara!\" he cried, coming up to the bed. \"Ferrara!\"    He dropped on his knees beside the dead man.    \"Ferrara, old fellow--\"    His cry ended in something like a sob. Robert Cairn turned, choking,  and went downstairs.    In the hall stood Felton and some other servants.    \"Miss Duquesne?\"    \"She has recovered, sir. Mrs. Hume has taken her to another bedroom.\"    Cairn hesitated, then walked into the deserted library, where a light  was burning. He began to pace up and down, clenching and unclenching  his fists. Presently Felton knocked and entered. Clearly the man was  glad of the chance to talk to someone.    \"Mr. Antony has been 'phoned at Oxford, sir. I thought you might like  to know. He is motoring down, sir, and will be here at four o'clock.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Cairn shortly.    Ten minutes later his father joined him. He was a slim, well-preserved  man, alert-eyed and active, yet he had aged five years in his son's  eyes. His face was unusually pale, but he exhibited no other signs of  emotion.    \"Well, Rob,\" he said, tersely. \"I can see you have something to tell  me. I am listening.\"    Robert Cairn leant back against a bookshelf.    \"I _have_ something to tell you, sir, and something to ask you.\"    \"Tell your story, first; then ask your question.\"    \"My story begins in a Thames backwater--\"    Dr. Cairn stared, squaring his jaw, but his son proceeded to relate,  with some detail, the circumstances attendant upon the death of the  king-swan. He went on to recount what took place in Antony Ferrara's  rooms, and at the point where something had been taken from the table  and thrown in the fire--    \"Stop!\" said Dr. Cairn. \"What did he throw in the fire?\"    The doctor's nostrils quivered, and his eyes were ablaze with some  hardly repressed emotion.    \"I cannot swear to it, sir--\"    \"Never mind. What do you _think_ he threw in the fire?\"    \"A little image, of wax or something similar--an image of--a swan.\"    At that, despite his self-control, Dr. Cairn became so pale that his  son leapt forward.    \"All right, Rob,\" his father waved him away, and turning, walked  slowly down the room.    \"Go on,\" he said, rather huskily.    Robert Cairn continued his story up to the time that he visited the  hospital where the dead girl lay.    \"You can swear that she was the original of the photograph in Antony's  rooms and the same who was waiting at the foot of the stair?\"    \"I can, sir.\"    \"Go on.\"    Again the younger man resumed his story, relating what he had learnt  from Myra Duquesne; what she had told him about the phantom hands;  what Felton had told him about the strange perfume perceptible in the  house.    \"The ring,\" interrupted Dr. Cairn--\"she would recognise it again?\"    \"She says so.\"    \"Anything else?\"    \"Only that if some of your books are to be believed, sir, Trois  Echelle, D'Ancre and others have gone to the stake for such things in  a less enlightened age!\"    \"Less enlightened, boy!\" Dr. Cairn turned his blazing eyes upon him.  \"_More_ enlightened where the powers of hell were concerned!\"    \"Then you think--\"    \"_Think_! Have I spent half my life in such studies in vain? Did I  labour with poor Michael Ferrara in Egypt and learn _nothing_? Just  God! what an end to his labour! What a reward for mine!\"    He buried his face in quivering hands.    \"I cannot tell exactly what you mean by that, sir,\" said Robert Cairn;  \"but it brings me to my question.\"    Dr. Cairn did not speak, did not move.    \"_Who is Antony Ferrara_?\"    The doctor looked up at that; and it was a haggard face he raised from  his hands.    \"You have tried to ask me that before.\"    \"I ask now, sir, with better prospect of receiving an answer.\"    \"Yet I can give you none, Rob.\"    \"Why, sir? Are you bound to secrecy?\"    \"In a degree, yes. But the real reason is this--I don't know.\"    \"You don't know!\"    \"I have said so.\"    \"Good God, sir, you amaze me! I have always felt certain that he was  really no Ferrara, but an adopted son; yet it had never entered my  mind that you were ignorant of his origin.\"    \"You have not studied the subjects which I have studied; nor do I wish  that you should; therefore it is impossible, at any rate now, to  pursue that matter further. But I may perhaps supplement your  researches into the history of Trois Echelles and Concini Concini. I  believe you told me that you were looking in my library for some work  which you failed to find?\"    \"I was looking for M. Chabas' translation of the _Papyrus Harris_.\"    \"What do you know of it?\"    \"I once saw a copy in Antony Ferrara's rooms.\"    Dr. Cairn started slightly.    \"Indeed. It happens that my copy is here; I lent it quite recently  to--Sir Michael. It is probably somewhere on the shelves.\"    He turned on more lights and began to scan the rows of books.  Presently--    \"Here it is,\" he said, and took down and opened the book on the table.  \"This passage may interest you.\" He laid his finger upon it.    His son bent over the book and read the following:--    \"Hai, the evil man, was a shepherd. He had said: 'O, that I might have  a book of spells that would give me resistless power!' He obtained a  book of the Formulas.... By the divine powers of these he enchanted  men. He obtained a deep vault furnished with implements. He made waxen  images of men, and love-charms. And then he perpetrated all the  horrors that his heart conceived.\"    \"Flinders Petrie,\" said Dr. Cairn, \"mentions the Book of Thoth as  another magical work conferring similar powers.\"    \"But surely, sir--after all, it's the twentieth century--this is mere  superstition!\"    \"I thought so--_once_!\" replied Dr. Cairn. \"But I have lived to know  that Egyptian magic was a real and a potent force. A great part of it  was no more than a kind of hypnotism, but there were other branches.  Our most learned modern works are as children's nursery rhymes beside  such a writing as the Egyptian _Ritual of the Dead_! God forgive me!  What have I done!\"    \"You cannot reproach yourself in any way, sir!\"    \"Can I not?\" said Dr. Cairn hoarsely. \"Ah, Rob, you don't know!\"    There came a rap on the door, and a local practitioner entered.    \"This is a singular case, Dr. Cairn,\" he began diffidently. \"An  autopsy--\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried Dr. Cairn. \"Sir Elwin Groves had foreseen it--so had  I!\"    \"But there are distinct marks of pressure"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#4)"],[1,"never forget you.\"    \"But, father,\" the Princess said, \"I don't want Stefan to go. He amuses  me and I like him. He said I needn't marry him unless I wanted to but,  father, I think I want to.\"    \"Wow! Wow!\" the Tsar roared. \"What! My daughter marry the son of a  farmer!\"    \"Now, father,\" the Princess said, \"it's no use your _wow-wowing_ at me  and you know it isn't. If I can't marry Stefan I won't marry any one.  And if I don't marry any one I'm going to stop eating again. So that's  that!\" And still holding Stefan's hand, the Princess turned her face to  the wall.    What could the poor Tsar do? At first he fumed and raged but as usual  after a day or two he came around to the Princess's way of thinking. In  fact it soon seemed to him that Stefan had been his choice from the  first and when one of his councilors remarked: \"Then, Your Majesty,  there's no use sending word to the neighboring kings that the Princess  has reached a marriageable age and would like to look over their sons,\"  the Tsar flew into an awful temper and roared:    \"Wow! Wow! You blockhead! Neighboring kings, indeed, and their  good-for-nothing sons! No, siree! The husband I want for my daughter is  an honest farmer lad who knows how to work and how to play! That's the  kind of son-in-law we need in this kingdom!\"    So Stefan and the little Princess were married and from that day the  castle was no longer gloomy but rang with laughter and merriment.  Presently the people of the kingdom, following the example of their  rulers, were laughing, too, and cracking jokes and, strange to say, they  soon found they were working all the better for their jollity.    Laughter grew so fashionable that even Mihailo and Jakov were forced to  take it up. They didn't do it very well but they practised at it  conscientiously. Whenever people talked about Stefan, they always pushed  forward importantly and said:    \"Ho! Ho! Ho! Do you mean Stefan, the Laughing Prince? Ha! Ha! Ha! Why,  do you know, he's our own brother!\"    As for Militza, the Princess had her come to the castle and said to her:    \"I owe all my happiness to you, my dear, for you it was who knew that of  course I would laugh at Stefan's nonsense! What sensible girl  wouldn't?\"          BEAUTY AND THE HORNS    [Illustration]    _The Story of an Enchanted Maiden_          BEAUTY AND THE HORNS      There was once a rich man who when he was dying called his son to his  bedside and said:    \"Danilo, my son, I am leaving you my riches. The only thing I ask of you  is this: close your ears to all reports of an enchanted maiden who is  known as Peerless Beauty and when the time comes that you wish to marry  choose for wife some quiet sensible girl of your native village.\"    Now if the father had not mentioned Peerless Beauty all might have been  well. Danilo might never have heard of her and after a time he would  probably have fallen in love with a girl of his native village and  married her. As it was, after his father's death he kept saying to  himself:    \"Peerless Beauty, the enchanted maiden of whom my father warned me! I  wonder is she really as beautiful as all that! I wonder where she  lives!\"    He thought about her until he could think of nothing else.    \"Peerless Beauty! Peerless Beauty! Oh, I must see this enchanted maiden  even if it costs me my life!\"    His father had a brother, a wise old man, who was supposed to know  everything in the world.    \"I will go to my uncle,\" the young man said. \"Perhaps he will tell me  where I can find Peerless Beauty.\"    So he went to his uncle and said:    \"My dear uncle, my father as he lay dying told me about a wonderful  maiden called Peerless Beauty. Can you tell me where she lives because I  want to see her for myself and judge whether she is as beautiful as my  father said.\"    His uncle looked at him gravely and shook his head.    \"My poor boy, how can I tell you where that enchanted maiden lives when  I know it would mean death to you if ever you saw her? Think no more  about her but go, find some suitable maid in the village, and marry her  like a sensible young man.\"    But his uncle's words, far from dissuading Danilo, only excited him the  more.    \"If my uncle knows where Peerless Beauty lives,\" he thought, \"other men  also know.\"    So one by one he went to all the old men in the village and asked them  what they knew of Peerless Beauty. One by one they shook their heads and  told him that Peerless Beauty was no maiden for him to be thinking  about.    \"Put her out of your mind,\" they said. \"These enchanted maidens are a  snare to young men. What you want to do is marry some quiet industrious  girl here in the village and settle down like a sensible young man.\"    But the oftener Danilo heard this advice, the more firmly convinced he  became that it was just what he did not want to do.    \"Time enough to settle down after I've seen Peerless Beauty,\" he told  himself. \"She must be beautiful indeed, or all these old men would not  be so anxious to keep me from seeing her. Well, if they won't tell me  where she is, I'll go out in the world and find her for myself.\"    So he put on rich clothes as befitted his wealth, took a bag of the gold  his father had left him, mounted his horse, and rode off into the world.  Everywhere he went he made inquiries about Peerless Beauty and  everywhere he found old men who knew about the enchanted maiden but  would tell him nothing. Every one of them advised him to go home like a  sensible young man and think no more about her. But all they said only  made him the more determined to see the maiden for himself.    Finally one day as evening approached he came to a little hut in the  woods. At the door of the hut sat a poor old woman. She held out her  hand as he passed and begged an alms. Danilo, being a kind hearted young  man, gave her a gold piece.    \"May God reward you!\" the old woman said.    \"Granny,\" Danilo asked, \"can you tell me the way to Peerless Beauty?\"    \"Aye, my son, that I can but he is a rash youth who seeks that maiden!  It were better for you to turn back than to go on!\"    \"But I'm not going to turn back!\" Danilo declared. \"Whatever the outcome  I'm going to find Peerless Beauty and see for myself why all men fear  her.\"    When the old woman saw that Danilo was determined, she gave up pleading  with him and pointed out a faint trail in the forest which, she told  him, would lead him to Peerless Beauty's castle.    He slept that night in the old woman's hut and early next morning set  out on the forest trail. By afternoon he reached the castle.    \"What do you want?\" the guards demanded roughly.    \"I want to see Peerless Beauty.\"    \"Have you gold?\" they asked him.    Danilo showed them his bag of ducats.    They led him into a hall of the castle and told him to put his gold on a  table. If he did so, perhaps Peerless Beauty would show herself and  perhaps she wouldn't.    Danilo did as the guards directed and then faced a curtain behind which,  they told him, Peerless Beauty was seated. The curtain opened a little,  but instead of showing her face Peerless Beauty extended only one  finger. However, that finger was so ravishingly beautiful that Danilo  almost fainted with delight. He would have stayed gazing on that one  enchanting finger for hours if the guards had not taken him roughly by  the shoulders and thrown him out of the castle.    \"Come again when you've got more gold!\" they shouted after him.    Like a man in a dream Danilo rode back to the old woman's hut.    \"Now, my son, are you satisfied?\" she asked him. \"Are you ready now to  go home and settle down like a sensible young man?\"    \"Oh, granny!\" Danilo raved. \"Such a finger! I must see that finger again  if it cost me my whole fortune!\"    He slept that night in the old woman's hut and the next day returned to  his native village. There he got another bag of the golden ducats which  his father had left him and at once started back to the castle of  Peerless Beauty.    This time that heartless maiden stripped him again of his gold, showed  him two of her enchanting fingers, and as before had her guards throw  him out of the castle.    \"Come again when you've got more gold!\" they shouted after him.    That's exactly what the poor young man did. He went back and back until  the fortune that his father had left him was entirely squandered. And  all he had seen of Peerless Beauty up to that time were the fingers of  one hand! Shouldn't you suppose that now with all his wealth lost he  would get over his foolish infatuation? Well, he didn't.    \"I must go back again!\" he kept telling himself.    His gold was gone but he still had his father's house. It was a big old  house with garrets and cellars.    \"Perhaps if I hunt I shall find some treasures hidden away in odd  corners,\" Danilo said.    So he hunted upstairs and down. He opened old boxes and rummaged about  among the dark rafters. One day he came upon a funny looking little cap.    \"I wonder whose this was,\" he thought to himself.    He went to a mirror and tried the cap on. Then a strange thing happened.  The moment the cap touched his head, Danilo disappeared.    \"Ah!\" he cried, \"it's a magic cap and the moment I put it on I become  invisible! Now I can slip into Peerless Beauty's chamber and see her  lovely face!\"    With his magic cap pulled tightly down over his forehead, he set off  once more for Peerless Beauty's castle. Sure enough he was able to pass  unseen the guards at the gate, he was able to go boldly into the great  hall, and beyond it through the curtain into Peerless Beauty's own  chamber.    The Beauty was seated with her back to the curtain and a serving maid  was combing out her hair for the night. It was lovely hair and it fell  down over Beauty's shoulders like a mantle of gold. At mere sight of it  Danilo was so overcome with emotion that he sighed.    \"What's that?\" Beauty cried. \"There's some one in my chamber!\"    The serving maid "]]]
