Egyptian control had passed  from Canaan at the time of the Hebrew settlement, which was indeed a  comparatively late episode in the early history of Syria. Whether or not  we identify the Khabiri with the Hebrews, the character of the latter's  incursion is strikingly illustrated by some of the Tell el-Amarna  letters. We see a nomad folk pressing in upon settled peoples and  gaining a foothold here and there.(2)         (1) In some versions of his new records Sargon states that       \"5,400 men daily eat bread before him\" (see Poebel, op.       cit., p. 178); though the figure may be intended to convey       an idea of the size of Sargon's court, we may perhaps see in       it a not inaccurate estimate of the total strength of his       armed forces.         (2) See especially Professor Burney's forthcoming commentary       on Judges (passim), and his forthcoming Schweich Lectures       (now delivered, in 1917).    The great change from desert life consists in the adoption of  agriculture, and when once that was made by the Hebrews any further  advance in economic development was dictated by their new surroundings.  The same process had been going on, as we have seen, in Syria since the  dawn of history, the Semitic nomad passing gradually through the stages  of agricultural and village life into that of the city. The country  favoured the retention of tribal exclusiveness, but ultimate survival  could only be purchased at the cost of some amalgamation with their new  neighbours. Below the surface of Hebrew history these two tendencies  may be traced in varying action and reaction. Some sections of the  race engaged readily in the social and commercial life of Canaanite  civilization with its rich inheritance from the past. Others, especially  in the highlands of Judah and the south, at first succeeded in keeping  themselves remote from foreign influence. During the later periods of  the national life the country was again subjected, and in an intensified  degree, to those forces of political aggression from Mesopotamia and  Egypt which we have already noted as operating in Canaan. But throughout  the settled Hebrew community as a whole the spark of desert fire was  not extinguished, and by kindling the zeal of the Prophets it eventually  affected nearly all the white races of mankind.    In his Presidential Address before the British Association at  Newcastle,(1) Sir Arthur Evans emphasized the part which recent  archaeology has played in proving the continuity of human culture from  the most remote periods. He showed how gaps in our knowledge had been  bridged, and he traced the part which each great race had taken in  increasing its inheritance. We have, in fact, ample grounds for assuming  an interchange, not only of commercial products, but, in a minor degree,  of ideas within areas geographically connected; and it is surely not  derogatory to any Hebrew writer to suggest that he may have adopted, and  used for his own purposes, conceptions current among his contemporaries.  In other words, the vehicle of religious ideas may well be of composite  origin; and, in the course of our study of early Hebrew tradition, I  suggest that we hold ourselves justified in applying the comparative  method to some at any rate of the ingredients which went to form the  finished product. The process is purely literary, but it finds an  analogy in the study of Semitic art, especially in the later periods.  And I think it will make my meaning clearer if we consider for a moment  a few examples of sculpture produced by races of Semitic origin. I do  not suggest that we should regard the one process as in any way proving  the existence of the other. We should rather treat the comparison as  illustrating in another medium the effect of forces which, it is clear,  were operative at various periods upon races of the same stock from  which the Hebrews themselves were descended. In such material products  the eye at once detects the Semite's readiness to avail himself of  foreign models. In some cases direct borrowing is obvious; in others, to  adapt a metaphor from music, it is possible to trace extraneous _motifs_  in the design.(2)         (1) \"New Archaeological Lights on the Origins of       Civilization in Europe,\" British Association, Newcastle-on-       Tyne, 1916.         (2) The necessary omission of plates, representing the       slides shown in the lectures, has involved a recasting of       most passages in which points of archaeological detail were       discussed; see Preface. But the following paragraphs have       been retained as the majority of the monuments referred to       are well known.    Some of the most famous monuments of Semitic art date from the Persian  and Hellenistic periods, and if we glance at them in this connexion it  is in order to illustrate during its most obvious phase a tendency of  which the earlier effects are less pronounced. In the sarcophagus of the  Sidonian king Eshmu-'azar II, which is preserved in the Louvre,(1)  we have indeed a monument to which no Semitic sculptor can lay claim.  Workmanship and material are Egyptian, and there is no doubt that it was  sculptured in Egypt and transported to Sidon by sea. But the king's own  engravers added the long Phoenician inscription, in which he adjures  princes and men not to open his resting-place since there are no jewels  therein, concluding with some potent curses against any violation of his  tomb. One of the latter implores the holy gods to deliver such violators  up \"to a mighty prince who shall rule over them\", and was probably  suggested by Alexander's recent occupation of Sidon in 332 B.C. after  his reduction and drastic punishment of Tyre. King Eshmun-'zar was not  unique in his choice of burial in an Egyptian coffin, for he merely  followed the example of his royal father, Tabnith, \"priest of  'Ashtart and king of the Sidonians\", whose sarcophagus, preserved at  Constantinople, still bears in addition to his own epitaph that of  its former occupant, a certain Egyptian general Penptah. But more  instructive than these borrowed memorials is a genuine example of  Phoenician work, the stele set up by Yehaw-milk, king of Byblos, and  dating from the fourth or fifth century B.C.(2) In the sculptured panel  at the head of the stele the king is represented in the Persian dress of  the period standing in the presence of 'Ashtart or Astarte, his \"Lady,  Mistress of Byblos\". There is no doubt that the stele is of native  workmanship, but the influence of Egypt may be seen in the technique of  the carving, in the winged disk above the figures, and still more in the  representation of the goddess in her character as the Egyptian Hathor,  with disk and horns, vulture head-dress and papyrus-sceptre. The  inscription records the dedication of an altar and shrine to the  goddess, and these too we may conjecture were fashioned on Egyptian  lines.         (1) _Corp. Inscr. Semit._, I. i, tab. II.         (2) _C.I.S._, I. i, tab. I.    The representation of Semitic deities under Egyptian forms and with  Egyptian attributes was encouraged by the introduction of their cults  into Egypt itself. In addition to Astarte of Byblos, Ba'al, Anath, and  Reshef were all borrowed from Syria in comparatively early times and  given Egyptian characters. The conical Syrian helmet of Reshef, a god  of war and thunder, gradually gave place to the white Egyptian crown,  so that as Reshpu he was represented as a royal warrior; and Qadesh,  another form of Astarte, becoming popular with Egyptian women as  a patroness of love and fecundity, was also sometimes modelled on  Hathor.(1)         (1) See W. Max Mueller, _Egyptological Researches_, I, p. 32       f., pl. 41, and S. A. Cook, _Religion of Ancient Palestine_,       pp. 83 ff.    Semitic colonists on the Egyptian border were ever ready to adopt  Egyptian symbolism in delineating the native gods to whom they owed  allegiance, and a particularly striking example of this may be seen on  a stele of the Persian period preserved in the Cairo Museum.(1) It was  found at Tell Defenneh, on the right bank of the Pelusiac branch of the  Nile, close to the old Egyptian highway into Syria, a site which may be  identified with that of the biblical Tahpanhes and the Daphnae of the  Greeks. Here it was that the Jewish fugitives, fleeing with Jeremiah  after the fall of Jerusalem, founded a Jewish colony beside a  flourishing Phoenician and Aramaean settlement. One of the local gods of  Tahpanhes is represented on the Cairo monument, an Egyptian stele in the  form of a naos with the winged solar disk upon its frieze. He stands  on the back of a lion and is clothed in Asiatic costume with the high  Syrian tiara crowning his abundant hair. The Syrian workmanship is  obvious, and the Syrian character of the cult may be recognized in such  details as the small brazen fire-altar before the god, and the sacred  pillar which is being anointed by the officiating priest. But the god  holds in his left hand a purely Egyptian sceptre and in his right an  emblem as purely Babylonian, the weapon of Marduk and Gilgamesh which  was also wielded by early Sumerian kings.         (1) Mueller, op. cit., p. 30 f., pl. 40. Numismatic evidence       exhibits a similar readiness on the part of local Syrian       cults to adopt the veneer of Hellenistic civilization while       retaining in great measure their own individuality; see       Hill, \"Some Palestinian Cults in the Graeco-Roman Age\", in       _Proceedings of the British Academy_, Vol. V (1912).    The Elephantine papyri have shown that the early Jews of the Diaspora,  though untrammeled by the orthodoxy of Jerusalem, maintained the purity  of their local cult in the face of considerable difficulties. Hence the  gravestones of their Aramaean contemporaries, which have been found in  Egypt, can only be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20300"],[0,"Henry VIII. (#4)"],[1,"the princes of Europe had no reason to desire a Yorkist  restoration, they thought that a little judicious backing of Yorkist  claimants would be amply repaid by the restriction of Henry's energies  to domestic affairs. Seven months after the battle of Bosworth there  was a rising in the West under the Staffords, and in the North under  Lovell; and Henry himself was nearly captured while celebrating at  York the feast of St. George. A year later a youth of obscure origin,  Lambert Simnel,[23] claimed to be first the Duke of York and then the  Earl of Warwick. The former was son, and the latter was nephew, of  Edward IV. Lambert was crowned king at Dublin amid the acclamations of  the Irish people. Not a voice was raised in Henry's favour; Kildare,  the practical ruler of Ireland, earls and archbishops, bishops and  barons, and great officers of State, from Lord Chancellor downwards,  swore fealty to the reputed son of an Oxford tradesman. Ireland was  only the volcano which gave vent to the subterranean flood;        (p. 010)  treason in England and intrigue abroad were working in secret concert  with open rebellion across St. George's Channel. The Queen Dowager was  secluded in Bermondsey Abbey and deprived of her jointure lands. John  de la Pole, who, as eldest son of Edward IV.'s sister, had been named  his successor by Richard III., fled to Burgundy; thence his aunt  Margaret sent Martin Schwartz and two thousand mercenaries to co-operate  with the Irish invasion. But, at East Stoke, De la Pole and Lovell,  Martin Schwartz and his merry men were slain; and the most serious of  the revolts against Henry ended in the consignment of Simnel to the  royal scullery and of his tutor to the Tower.                       [Footnote 23: See the present writer in _D.N.B._,                     lii., 261.]    Lambert, however, was barely initiated in his new duties when the son  of a boatman of Tournay started on a similar errand with a less  congenial end. An unwilling puppet at first, Perkin Warbeck was on a  trading visit to Ireland, when the Irish, who saw a Yorkist prince in  every likely face, insisted that Perkin was Earl of Warwick. This he  denied on oath before the Mayor of Cork. Nothing deterred, they  suggested that he was Richard III.'s bastard; but the bastard was safe  in Henry's keeping, and the imaginative Irish finally took refuge in  the theory that Perkin was Duke of York. Lambert's old friends rallied  round Perkin; the re-animated Duke was promptly summoned to the Court  of France and treated with princely honours. When Charles VIII. had  used him to beat down Henry's terms, Perkin found a home with  Margaret, aunt to all the pretenders. As usual, there were traitors in  high places in England. Sir William Stanley, whose brother had married  Henry's mother, and to whom Henry himself owed his victory at      (p. 011)  Bosworth, was implicated. His sudden arrest disconcerted the plot,  and when Perkin's fleet appeared off the coast of Kent, the rustics  made short work of the few who were rash enough to land. Perkin sailed  away to the Yorkist refuge in Ireland, but Kildare was no longer  deputy. Waterford, to which he laid siege, was relieved, and the  pretender sought in Scotland a third basis of operations. An abortive  raid on the Borders and a high-born Scottish wife[24] were all that he  obtained of James IV., and in 1497, after a second attempt in Ireland,  he landed in Cornwall. The Cornishmen had just risen against Henry's  extortions, marched on London and been defeated at Blackheath; but  Henry's lenience encouraged a fresh revolt, and three thousand men  flocked to Perkin's standard. They failed to take Exeter; Perkin was  seized at Beaulieu and sent up to London to be paraded through the  streets amid the jeers and taunts of the people. Two years later a  foolish attempt at escape and a fresh personation of the Earl of  Warwick by one Ralf Wulford[25] led to the execution of all three,  Perkin, Wulford, and the real Earl of Warwick, who had been a prisoner  and probably the innocent centre of so many plots since the accession  of Henry VII. Warwick's death may have been due to the instigation of  Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, who were negotiating for the marriage  of Catherine of Aragon with Prince Arthur. They were naturally anxious  for the security of the throne their daughter was to share with    (p. 012)  Henry's son; and now their ambassador wrote triumphantly that there  remained in England not a doubtful drop of royal blood.[26] There were  no more pretenders, and for the rest of Henry's reign England enjoyed  such peace as it had not known for nearly a century. The end which  Henry had sought by fair means and foul was attained, and there was no  practical alternative to his children in the succession to the English  throne.                       [Footnote 24: Perkin was the first of Lady                     Catherine Gordon's four husbands; her second was                     James Strangways, gentleman-usher to Henry VIII.,                     her third Sir Matthew Cradock (d. 1531), and her                     fourth Christopher Ashton, also gentleman-usher;                     she died in 1537 and was buried in Fyfield Church                     (_L. and P._, ii., 3512).]                       [Footnote 25: See the present writer in _Dict. Nat.                     Biog._, lxiii., 172.]                       [Footnote 26: _Sp. Cal._, i., No. 249; see below,                     p. 179.]    But all his statecraft, his patience and labour would have been writ  in water without children to succeed him and carry on the work which  he had begun; and at times it seemed probable that this necessary  condition would remain unfulfilled. For the Tudors were singularly  luckless in the matter of children. They were scarcely a sterile race,  but their offspring had an unfortunate habit of dying in childhood. It  was the desire for a male heir that involved Henry VIII. in his breach  with Rome, and led Mary into a marriage which raised a revolt; the  last of the Tudors perceived that heirs might be purchased at too  great a cost, and solved the difficulty by admitting its insolubility.  Henry VIII. had six wives, but only three children who survived  infancy; of these, Edward VI. withered away at the age of fifteen, and  Mary died childless at forty-two. By his two[27] mistresses he seems  to have had only one son, who died at the age of eleven, and as far as  we know, he had not a single grandchild, legitimate or other. His  sisters were hardly more fortunate. Margaret's eldest son by James IV.  died a year after his birth; her eldest daughter died at birth; her  second son lived only nine months; her second daughter died at     (p. 013)  birth; her third son lived to be James V., but her fourth found an  early grave. Mary, the other sister of Henry VIII., lost her only son  in his teens. The appalling death-rate among Tudor infants cannot be  attributed solely to medical ignorance, for Yorkist babies clung to  life with a tenacity which was quite as inconvenient as the readiness  with which Tudor infants relinquished it; and Richard III., Henry VII.  and Henry VIII. all found it necessary to accelerate, by artificial  means, the exit from the world of the superfluous children of other  pretenders. This drastic process smoothed their path, but could not  completely solve the problem; and the characteristic Tudor infirmity  was already apparent in the reign of Henry VII. He had three sons; two  predeceased him, one at the age of fifteen years, the other at fifteen  months. Of his four daughters, two died in infancy, and the youngest  cost the mother her life.[28] The fruit of that union between the Red  Rose and the White, upon which so much store had been set,[29] seemed  doomed to fail.                       [Footnote 27: There is no definite evidence that he                     had more.]                       [Footnote 28: _Ven. Cal._, i., 833.]                       [Footnote 29: _Cf._ Skelton, _Works_, ed. Dyce.                     vol. i., pp. ix-xi.]    The hopes built upon it had largely contributed to the success of  Henry's raid upon the English throne, and before he started on his  quest he had solemnly promised to marry Elizabeth, eldest daughter of  Edward IV., and heiress of the House of York. But he was resolute to  avoid all appearance of ruling in her right; his title had been  recognised by Parliament, and he had been five months _de facto_ king  before he wedded his Yorkist wife (18th January, 1486). Eight months  and two days later, the Queen gave birth, in the priory of St. Swithin's,  at Winchester, to her first-born son. Four days later, on Sunday,  (p. 014)  24th September, the child was christened in the minster of the old  West Saxon capital, and given in baptism the name of Arthur, the old  British king. It was neither Yorkist nor Lancastrian, it evoked no  bitter memories of civil strife, and it recalled the fact that the  Tudors claimed a pedigree and boasted a title to British sovereignty,  beside the antiquity of which Yorkist pretentions were a mushroom  growth. Duke of Cornwall from his birth, Prince Arthur was, when three  years old, created Prince of Wales. Already negotiations had been  begun for his marriage with Catherine, the daughter of Ferdinand of  Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Both were cautious sovereigns, and  many a rebellion had to be put down and many a pretender put away,  before they would consent to entrust their daughter to the care of an  English king. It was not till 2nd October, 1501, that Catherine landed  at Plymouth. At her formal reception into England, and at her  marriage, six weeks later, in St. Paul's, she was led by the hand of  her little brother-in-law, Prince Henry, then ten years old.[30]  Against the advice of his council, Henry VII. sent the youthful bride  and bridegroom to live as man and wife at Ludlow"]]]
