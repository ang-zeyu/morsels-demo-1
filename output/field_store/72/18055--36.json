There are several other restaurants which claim to be quite first class,  and which are smart and amusing. Two such are the restaurants facing the  Madeleine, Durand's, and La Rue's. It was in one of the little rooms on  the first floor of Durand's that the Brav' General sat debating in his  mind whether he should initiate a _coup d'etat_, and the crowd outside  waited and watched, expecting something to happen. Nothing did happen.  General Boulanger thought so long, that the decisive moment passed, and  he went home to bed. Boulanger has gone, but his friends, grey-headed  now, breakfast daily at Durand's. La Rue's was also a restaurant in  favour with General Boulanger, and I fancy that the little  dinner-parties he gave there helped much to bring the place into  celebrity. Both these restaurants have lately been enlarged and  redecorated, and La Rue's advertises a great deal, which no doubt has  increased its _clientele_, but which has not decreased its prices.  Parisian Society has decreed that it is \"smart\" to sup at Durand's, and  I always find it an excellent place at which to breakfast. The last time  that I took my morning meal there I found all the younger members of the  British Embassy breakfasting there, a sure sign that the place is just  now on the crest of the wave.    Some of the specialities of Durand's are _Potage Henri IV._, _Consomme  Baigneuse_, _petits diables_, _Barbue Durand_, _Poulet Saute Grand Duc_,  _Salade Georgette_, _Souffle Pole Nord_, and of course a variation of  the inevitable _canard a la presse_ and the woodcock subjected to an  _auto-da-fe_.    This is the supper that the Restaurant Durand gave its clients on the  greatest supping night of the year, Christmas Eve, 1902. The _boudin_ of  course all Paris has for supper on the night before the great Christmas  feast:--        Consomme de Volaille au fumet de Celeris.            Boudin grille a la Parisienne.           Ailerons de Volaille a la Tzar.                Cailles a la Lucullus.                    Salade Durand.          Ecrevisses de la Meuse a la nage.                   Crepes Suzette.                       Dessert.                     Champagnes.      Clicquot Brut, Pommery Drapeau Americain.                 Gde Fine Napoleon.    At La Rue's I have felt inclined sometimes to protest when I have been  charged 2 francs for half-a-dozen prawns, and to think that the  vermillion-coloured seats are being paid for too quickly out of profits;  but I rarely pass through Paris without breakfasting there, and eating  the cold poached eggs in jelly, the _Grenouilles a la Mariniere_, or  one of the dishes of cold fish which are excellently served. Some of the  specialities of the house are _Potage Reine_, _Barbue a la Russe_,  _Caille a la Souvaroff_, _Tournedos a la Rossini_, _Caneton de Rouen au  Sang_, _Becasse Flambee_, _Salade Gauloise_, _Crepes Suzette_, _Glace  Gismonda_, _Peches Flambees_ and from this list any one could choose  either a little dinner or a big one.    Of restaurants attached to hotels I do not propose to write in this  article, with one exception, for there are few of the hundreds of hotels  at which one cannot get a very fair dinner; and at some, such as the  Elysee Palace, over which Caesario presides, one can get an excellent  one; but the purpose of this book is to give information to the man who  wishes to dine away from hotels. The one exception is the Ritz, in the  Place Vendome, and I include this in my list because the Ritz is a  restaurant firstly, and an hotel secondly, and because as a dining place  it holds an exceptional position in Paris. It is the restaurant of the  smartest foreign society in Paris, and the English, Americans, Russians,  Spaniards, dining there always outnumber greatly the French. It is a  place of great feasts, but it is also a restaurant at which the  _maitres-d'hotel_ are instructed not to suggest long dinners to the  patrons of the establishment. In M. Elles' hands or that of the  _maitre-d'hotel_ there is no fear of being \"rushed\" into ordering an  over-lengthy repast. This is a typical little dinner for three I once  ate at the Ritz, and as a feast in the autumn it is worth recording and  repeating:--                      Caviar.                Consomme Viveni.      Mousseline de Soles au vin du Rhin.      Queues d'Ecrevisses a l'Americaine.       Escalopes de Riz de veau Favorite.              Perdreaux Truffes.                    Salade.          Asperges vertes en branches.              Coupes aux Marrons.                  Friandises.    In the afternoon the long passage with its chairs, carpets, and hangings  all of crushed strawberry colour is filled with tea-drinkers, for the \"5  o'clock\" is very popular in Paris, and the Ritz is one of the smartest  if not the smartest place at which to drink tea. In the evening the big  restaurant, with its ceiling painted to represent the sky and its  mirrors latticed to represent windows, is always full, the contrast to a  smart English restaurant being that three-quarters of the ladies dine in  their hats. Sometimes very elaborate entertainments are given in the  Ritz, and I can recall one occasion on a hot summer night, when the  garden was tented over and turned into a gorge apparently somewhere near  the North Pole, there being blocks and pillars of ice everywhere. The  anteroom was a mass of palms, and the idea of the assemblage of the  guests in the tropics and their sudden transference to the land of ice  was excellently carried out. I give the menu of another great dinner at  the Ritz because, not only has it some of the specialities of the house  embodied in it, but that it is a good specimen of what a great dinner  should be, being important but not heavy:--                    Caviar frais. Hors-d'oeuvre.            Royal Tortue Claire. Creme d'Artichauts.      Mousseline d'Eperlans aux Ecrevisses a l'Americaine.        Noisettes de Ris de Veau au fumet de Champignons.       Selle de Chevreuil Grand Veneur. Puree de Marrons.                  Poularde de Houdan Vendome.                       Sorbets au Kirsch.                     Ortolans aux Croutons.                       Coeurs de Laitues.         Asperges vertes en branches. Sauce Mousseline.                  Ananas voile a l'Orientale.                          Friandises.                     Corbeilles de Fruits.                               VINS.                        Chateau Caillou 1888.            Chateau Leoville Lascases 1878 (Magnums).                   Lanson Brut 1892 (Magnums).                      Chateau Yquem 1869.           Grande Fine Champagne 1790 (Ritz Reserve).    There are a score of capital restaurants in Paris which may be called  \"bourgeois\" without in any way detracting from their excellence. An  excellent type of such a restaurant is Maire's, at the corner of the Bd.  St-Dennis, owned by the company which controls the Paillard's Restaurant  of the Champs Elysees. It is a good place to dine at for any one going  to the play at the Porte St-Martin, the Renaissance, the Theatre  Antoine, or any of the music halls or theatres in the west of Paris.  Mushrooms always seem to me to play a great part in the cookery at  Maire's, and the _Poulet Maire_ is a fowl cooked with mushrooms; but the  restaurant has a long list of specialities of all kinds, and the  mushroom only appears in some of them. Charbonnier is the especial  dinner wine of the house, and it is said that the name was originally  given to the wine owing to the discovery of a quantity of it stored  under sticks of charcoal in the days when Maire's was only a wine-shop.    Next door to the Gymnase Theatre is Marguery's, which always seems to be  full, and where the service is rather too hurried and too slap-dash to  suit the contemplative gourmet; but Marguery's has its special claim to  fame as the place where the _Sole Marguery_ was invented, and though I  have eaten the dish in half a hundred restaurants, there is no place  where it is so perfectly cooked as in the restaurant where it was first  thought of, for nowhere else is the sauce quite as good or as strong.    Notta, 2 Bd. Poissoniere, and Noel Peters in the Passage des Princes,  both have claims to celebrity for their cooking, and the fish dishes at  the latter, the _Filet de Sole Noel_ for instance, are a speciality. The  Boeuf a la Mode, Rue de Valois, near the Palais Royale, is a place of  good cookery.    There are two restaurants to which I generally go if I want good food  but have not time to linger over it, having cut my time rather close  when going to a theatre or to catch a train. One of these is Lucas's in  the little square opposite the Madeleine, and the other is the  Champeaux, Place de la Bourse. Lucas has rather an old-fashioned  _clientele_ and his restaurant is not very bright, but the cooking is  good, and if in a hurry one is served very quickly. The _Hareng Lucas_  is an exceptionally stimulating _hors-d'oeuvre_, and there is a  selection of old brandies to choose from as liqueurs which I fancy  cannot be surpassed at any restaurant in Paris. The Champeaux, with its  garden and trees growing through the roof, is the restaurant of the  Bourse. It has a good cook, it has its specialities of cuisine, and it  has a particularly good cellar of wines. One can dine there in the  leisurely manner in which a dinner should be eaten by sane men; but the  _maitres-d'hotel_ used to business men know that there are occasions  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#4)"],[1,"forward, he clutched me by the arm and  keenly examined my countenance. His very look was an interrogation.    I simply nodded.    With an incredulous shrug of the shoulders, he turned upon his heel.  Undoubtedly he thought I had gone mad.    \"I have made a very important discovery.\"    His eyes flashed with excitement. His hand was lifted in a menacing  attitude. For a moment neither of us spoke. It is hard to say which was  most excited.    \"You don't mean to say that you have any idea of the meaning of the  scrawl?\"    \"I do,\" was my desperate reply. \"Look at the sentence as dictated by  you.\"    \"Well, but it means nothing,\" was the angry answer.    \"Nothing if you read from left to right, but mark, if from right to  left--\"    \"Backwards!\" cried my uncle, in wild amazement. \"Oh most cunning  Saknussemm; and I to be such a blockhead!\"    He snatched up the document, gazed at it with haggard eye, and read it  out as I had done.    It read as follows:          <i>In Sneffels Yoculis craterem kem delibat      umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende,      audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.      Kod feci. Arne Saknussemm</i>      Which dog Latin being translated, reads as follows:           Descend into the crater of Yocul of Sneffels, which the shade of       Scartaris caresses, before the kalends of July, audacious traveler,       and you will reach the centre of the earth. I did it.                                                   ARNE SAKNUSSEMM      My uncle leaped three feet from the ground with joy. He looked radiant  and handsome. He rushed about the room wild with delight and  satisfaction. He knocked over tables and chairs. He threw his books  about until at last, utterly exhausted, he fell into his armchair.    \"What's o'clock?\" he asked.    \"About three.\"    \"My dinner does not seem to have done me much good,\" he observed. \"Let  me have something to eat. We can then start at once. Get my portmanteau  ready.\"    \"What for?\"    \"And your own,\" he continued. \"We start at once.\"    My horror may be conceived. I resolved however to show no fear.  Scientific reasons were the only ones likely to influence my uncle. Now,  there were many against this terrible journey. The very idea of going  down to the centre of the earth was simply absurd. I determined  therefore to argue the point after dinner.    My uncle's rage was now directed against the cook for having no dinner  ready. My explanation however satisfied him, and having gotten the key,  she soon contrived to get sufficient to satisfy our voracious appetites.    During the repast my uncle was rather gay than otherwise. He made some  of those peculiar jokes which belong exclusively to the learned. As  soon, however, as dessert was over, he called me to his study. We each  took a chair on opposite sides of the table.    \"Henry,\" he said, in a soft and winning voice; \"I have always believed  you ingenious, and you have rendered me a service never to be forgotten.  Without you, this great, this wondrous discovery would never have been  made. It is my duty, therefore, to insist on your sharing the glory.\"    \"He is in a good humor,\" thought I; \"I'll soon let him know my opinion  of glory.\"    \"In the first place,\" he continued, \"you must keep the whole affair a  profound secret. There is no more envious race of men than scientific  discoverers. Many would start on the same journey. At all events, we  will be the first in the field.\"    \"I doubt your having many competitors,\" was my reply.    \"A man of real scientific acquirements would be delighted at the chance.  We should find a perfect stream of pilgrims on the traces of Arne  Saknussemm, if this document were once made public.\"    \"But, my dear sir, is not this paper very likely to be a hoax?\" I urged.    \"The book in which we find it is sufficient proof of its authenticity,\"  he replied.    \"I thoroughly allow that the celebrated Professor wrote the lines, but  only, I believe, as a kind of mystification,\" was my answer.    Scarcely were the words out of my mouth, when I was sorry I had uttered  them. My uncle looked at me with a dark and gloomy scowl, and I began to  be alarmed for the results of our conversation. His mood soon changed,  however, and a smile took the place of a frown.    \"We shall see,\" he remarked, with decisive emphasis.    \"But see, what is all this about Yocul, and Sneffels, and this  Scartaris? I have never heard anything about them.\"    \"The very point to which I am coming. I lately received from my friend  Augustus Peterman, of Leipzig, a map. Take down the third atlas from the  second shelf, series Z, plate 4.\"    I rose, went to the shelf, and presently returned with the volume  indicated.    \"This,\" said my uncle, \"is one of the best maps of Iceland. I believe it  will settle all your doubts, difficulties and objections.\"    With a grim hope to the contrary, I stooped over the map.          CHAPTER 4    WE START ON THE JOURNEY      \"You see, the whole island is composed of volcanoes,\" said the  Professor, \"and remark carefully that they all bear the name of Yocul.  The word is Icelandic, and means a glacier. In most of the lofty  mountains of that region the volcanic eruptions come forth from icebound  caverns. Hence the name applied to every volcano on this extraordinary  island.\"    \"But what does this word Sneffels mean?\"    To this question I expected no rational answer. I was mistaken.    \"Follow my finger to the western coast of Iceland, there you see  Reykjavik, its capital. Follow the direction of one of its innumerable  fjords or arms of the sea, and what do you see below the sixty-fifth  degree of latitude?\"    \"A peninsula--very like a thighbone in shape.\"    \"And in the centre of it--?\"    \"A mountain.\"    \"Well, that's Sneffels.\"    I had nothing to say.    \"That is Sneffels--a mountain about five thousand feet in height, one of  the most remarkable in the whole island, and certainly doomed to be the  most celebrated in the world, for through its crater we shall reach the  centre of the earth.\"    \"Impossible!\" cried I, startled and shocked at the thought.    \"Why impossible?\" said Professor Hardwigg in his severest tones.    \"Because its crater is choked with lava, by burning rocks--by infinite  dangers.\"    \"But if it be extinct?\"    \"That would make a difference.\"    \"Of course it would. There are about three hundred volcanoes on the  whole surface of the globe--but the greater number are extinct. Of these  Sneffels is one. No eruption has occurred since 1219--in fact it has  ceased to be a volcano at all.\"    After this what more could I say? Yes,--I thought of another objection.    \"But what is all this about Scartaris and the kalends of July--?\"    My uncle reflected deeply. Presently he gave forth the result of his  reflections in a sententious tone. \"What appears obscure to you, to me  is light. This very phrase shows how particular Saknussemm is in his  directions. The Sneffels mountain has many craters. He is careful  therefore to point the exact one which is the highway into the Interior  of the Earth. He lets us know, for this purpose, that about the end of  the month of June, the shadow of Mount Scartaris falls upon the one  crater. There can be no doubt about the matter.\"    My uncle had an answer for everything.    \"I accept all your explanations\" I said, \"and Saknussemm is right. He  found out the entrance to the bowels of the earth, he has indicated  correctly, but that he or anyone else ever followed up the discovery is  madness to suppose.\"    \"Why so, young man?\"    \"All scientific teaching, theoretical and practical, shows it to be  impossible.\"    \"I care nothing for theories,\" retorted my uncle.    \"But is it not well-known that heat increases one degree for every  seventy feet you descend into the earth? Which gives a fine idea of the  central heat. All the matters which compose the globe are in a state of  incandescence; even gold, platinum, and the hardest rocks are in a state  of fusion. What would become of us?\"    \"Don't be alarmed at the heat, my boy.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Neither you nor anybody else know anything about the real state of the  earth's interior. All modern experiments tend to explode the older  theories. Were any such heat to exist, the upper crust of the earth  would be shattered to atoms, and the world would be at an end.\"    A long, learned and not uninteresting discussion followed, which ended  in this wise:    \"I do not believe in the dangers and difficulties which you, Henry, seem  to multiply; and the only way to learn, is like Arne Saknussemm, to go  and see.\"    \"Well,\" cried I, overcome at last, \"let us go and see. Though how we can  do that in the dark is another mystery.\"    \"Fear nothing. We shall overcome these, and many other difficulties.  Besides, as we approach the centre, I expect to find it luminous--\"    \"Nothing is impossible.\"    \"And now that we have come to a thorough understanding, not a word to  any living soul. Our success depends on secrecy and dispatch.\"    Thus ended our memorable conference, which roused a perfect fever in me.  Leaving my uncle, I went forth like one possessed. Reaching the banks of  the Elbe, I began to think. Was all I had heard really and truly  possible? Was my uncle in his sober senses, and could the interior of  the earth be reached? Was I the victim of a madman, or was he a  discoverer of rare courage and grandeur of conception?    To a certain extent I was anxious to be off. I was afraid my enthusiasm  would cool. I determined to pack up at once. At the end of an hour,  however, on my way home, I found that my feelings had very much changed.    \"I'm all abroad,\" I cried; \"'tis a nightmare--I must have dreamed it.\"    At this moment I came face to face with Gretchen, whom I warmly  embraced.    \"So you have come to meet me,\" she said; \"how good of you. But what is  the matter?\"    Well, it was no use mincing the matter, I told her all. She"]]]
