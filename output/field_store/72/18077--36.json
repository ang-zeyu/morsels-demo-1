This splice is employed for joining the ends of  a rope when a chafed part has been cut out, and is quite as strong as  the rope itself.    40. Belaying-pin opened to serve as a button; these are used where it  is necessary to stop or check velocity.    41. Chain knot, or fastening.    42. Variable or regulating lashing. By laying the piece, a f,  horizontally, it can be slipped along the rope, b; by raising or  lowering this, we shall raise or depress the weight, c, the cord, b,  running over the two pulleys, d, from the piece, a f, in the direction  shown in the figure. The friction of the cord, b, passing through the  hole, e, sufficiently fixes the piece, a f, and holds the weight, c,  securely.    43. Cleet, with three ties.    44. Cleet, showing the mode of belaying the cord.    45. The piece, a f, of No. 42.    46. Fair leader.    47. Cleet to be fixed to a stay.    48. Loop for slipping other lines.    49. A \"bend\" which is only used for fear of the stoppers snapping.    50. Bastard loop, made on the end of the rope, and whipped with yarns.    51. Tie to pins: a, the pin; b, small cords fixed by a cross tie.    52. Cleet, fixed to the \"rail,\" either with screws or nails, to which  the lines are belayed.    53. Waterman's knot.    54. Fair leader.    55. Tie, or bend to pier.    56. Simple fastening to tie.    57. Fastening by a loop. This can be tied or untied without loosening  the loop itself. It is made by following, towards the longer loop, the  direction as numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and is terminated by the loop, 6,  7, 6, finally passing it over the head of the post, A. This knot holds  itself, the turns being in opposite directions. To untie it, we slack  the turns of the cable sufficiently to again pass the loop, 6, 7, 6,  over the post, A, and turn the ends in the contrary direction to that  in which they were made (as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).    58. Iron \"shell,\" in two views.    59 and 60. \"Wedding\" knots; a b, eyelets; c d, the join; e, the  fastening.    61. Lark's-head fastening to running knot.    62. A round turn; the cord, a, is passed through the bight of the  cord, b, over the button, c, where it is secured by an ordinary knot.    63. Belaying-pin splice. The cord, b, \"stops\" the pin, e, its end  being spliced upon itself, and \"served\" with yarn; this rope, with its  pin, is passed through the spliced eye, f of the line, g.    64. Round button.    65. Joint by a spherical shell, each loop, a and b, being made by ties  and splices, and surrounding the shell, c.    66. Belaying-pin, shown separately, before being stoppered.    67. Fastening to shears.    68. Square mooring. When the cable is round the post, A, and the  piece, c, without being crossed, it lays in the section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6, 7, and the end is fastened by tying.    69. Wooden shell in section.    70. Crossed fastening. The turns of the cable, passing in front of the  post, B, are crossed at the back of C, in the direction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6, 7, 8, the end, 8, being secured to the cable.    71. Wooden shell.    72. Double-chain fastening.    73. Lashing for \"ram\" block, or \"dead-eye.\" The ram blocks, a and b,  are strapped by the cords, e, which hold them; the small lanyards,  d, pass through the holes to make the connection, and as they are  tightened give the requisite tension to the cordage; the ends are  fastened to the main rope. Usually one of these dead-eyes is held by  an iron strap to the point where it is required to fix and strain the  cordage, which is ordinarily a shroud.    74. Chain fastening.      1'. Simple band, showing the upper side.      2'. The same, showing the under side and the knot.      3'. Tie, with crossed ends, commenced; a turn is taken under the    strands, to hold the ends of the cord.      4'. The same, completed.      5'. Bend with crossed strands, commenced, the one end being looped    over the other.      6'. The same, completed.      7'. Necklace tie, seen on the upper side.      8'. The same, seen underneath. The greater the strain on the cords,    the tighter the knot becomes.      9' and 10' are similar splices to 7' and 8' with slight    modifications.      11' shows the commencement of 13', the legs in elevation; 12' being    a front view. An ordinary band, made by several turns of a small    rope, is lapped round them and hauled taut, and then interlaced at    the ends. This done, the legs are shifted into the shape of a St.    Andrew's cross. Thus the lashing is tightened, and, for further    security, we pass the line several times over the tie and between    the spars, knotting the ends.      13'. Portuguese knot. This is a lashing for shear legs, and must be    tight enough to prevent the spars slipping on each other; the    crossing of the two legs gives a means of securing the knot.      14'. For binding timbers; a, knot commenced. Take several turns    round the timbers, and fasten the ends by passing them under the    turns; b, knot completed. The end of a round stick, m n, termed a    packing stick, should be passed under the knob, the cord being slack    enough to allow of this. By turning the stick, the turns can be    tightened to any extent; when tight, we fasten the longer arm of the    lever to some fixed point, by a rope, p q, so that it cannot fly    back. Care must be taken not to turn the stick too far, or the rope    may be broken. As the timber dries and shrinks, the lever may be    used to make all taut again.           *       *       *       *       *          THE HARTFORD STEAM BOILER INSPECTION AND INSURANCE COMPANY.      The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company makes the  following report of its inspections in January, 1871:    During the month, there were 522 visits of inspection made, and 1,030  boilers examined--853 externally and 363 internally, while 106  have been tested by hydraulic pressure. Number of defects in all  discovered, 431, of which 163 were regarded as dangerous. These  defects were as follows: Furnaces out of shape, 24--3 dangerous;  fractures, 47--25 dangerous; burned plates, 29--14 dangerous;  blistered plates, 54--10 dangerous; cases of sediment and deposit,  97--18 dangerous; cases of incrustation and scale, 70--24 dangerous.  To show how little attention is paid to the internal condition of  boilers by incompetent engineers, we copy the following from a letter  of one of our inspectors:    \"In one tubular boiler I found sediment in the back end, eight inches  deep, and extending forward more than four feet. It seemed to be an  accumulation of fine scale cemented together, so that it was necessary  to break it up with a hammer and chisel before it could be removed.  The engineer said _he had cleaned the boilers only three days before_,  and objected to my making another examination. This is one of the  many cases we find, where the proprietor trusts everything about his  boilers to his engineer, supposing him to be reliable.\"    With such accumulation of sediment and deposit, is it any wonder that  sheets are burned? A careful engineer will understand, if the feed  water be impure, that he must blow down two or three inches every day,  or oftener, that the sediment may be removed as it accumulates, and  then an internal examination once in two weeks, or once a month, will  insure a clean boiler.    Cases of external corrosion, 26--10 dangerous; cases of internal  corrosion, 17--5 dangerous; cases of internal grooving, 28--11  dangerous; water gages out of order, 50; blow-out apparatus out of  order, 15--7 dangerous; safety valves overloaded, 40--12 dangerous;  pressure gages out of order, 54--6 dangerous, varying from -15 to  +8 pounds. (We have found several gages entirely ruined from being  frozen). Boilers without gages, 4; cases of deficiency of water,  5--1 dangerous; broken braces and stays, 31--7 dangerous; boilers  condemned, 2--both dangerous.    Two engineers were found drunk on duty, and promptly discharged. There  were 9 serious explosions during the month, by which 99 persons were  killed, and 6 wounded. Eighty-seven of the killed were passengers on  the ill-fated steamer _H.R. Arthur_, on the Mississippi River. Many  were drowned, and some burned, but the origin of the calamity was the  bad quality of the boilers, which a careless management was unable  to detect. The upper and fore part of the boat was blown away by the  exploded boilers, and, to add to the horror, what remained took fire.    None of these exploded boilers were under the care of this company.           *       *       *       *       *      Five ore-roasting furnaces are in full blast in Nevada.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED COMPOUND SPIRAL CAR SPRING FOR RAILWAY CARRIAGES.      Our engravings illustrate an improved compound car-spring, which  appears to possess all the requisites of a first-class spring,  combining in its construction extreme simplicity with great strength,  and a feature whereby the power of the spring increases with increase  of the load, and _vice versa_, so that its flexibility remains nearly  constant for all loads.

(#4)"],[1,"tongue, the sensation which he experiences is  not to be referred to the salt or sugar, but to God's agency. When this  theory is extended, as it generally is by its advocates, from the  external to the internal world, the universe of matter and mind, with  all their phenomena, is a constant effect of the omnipresent activity of  God. The minds of some men, as remarked above, are so constituted that  they can pass from the theory that God does nothing, to the doctrine  that He does everything, without seeing the difference. Mr. Russel  Wallace, the companion and peer of Mr. Darwin, devotes a large part of  his book on \"Natural Selection,\" to prove that the organs of plants and  animals are formed by blind physical causes. Toward the close of the  volume he teaches that there are no such causes. He asks the question,  What is Matter? and answers, Nothing. We know, he says, nothing but  force; and as the only force of which we have any immediate knowledge  is mind-force, the inference is \"that the whole universe is not merely  dependent on, but actually _is_, the will of higher intelligences, or of  one Supreme Intelligence.\"[5] This is a transition from virtual  materialism to idealistic pantheism. The effect of this admission on the  part of Mr. Wallace on the theory of natural selection, is what an  explosion of its boiler would be to a steamer in mid-ocean, which should  blow out its deck, sides, and bottom. Nothing would remain above water.    The Duke of Argyll seems at times inclined to lapse into the same  doctrine. \"Science,\" he says, \"in the modern doctrine of conservation of  energy and the convertibility of forces, is already getting a firm hold  of the idea, that all kinds of force are but forms of manifestations of  one central force issuing from some one fountain-head of power. Sir John  Herschel has not hesitated to say, 'that it is but reasonable to regard  the force of gravitation as the direct or indirect result of a  consciousness or will existing somewhere.' And even if we cannot  certainly identify force in all its forms with the direct energies of  the one Omnipresent and All-pervading Will, it is at least in the  highest degree unphilosophical to assert the contrary,--to think or to  speak, as if the forces of nature were either independent of, or even  separate from the Creator's power.\"[6] The Duke, however, in the general  tenor of his book, does not differ from the common doctrine, except in  one point. He does not deny the efficiency of physical causes, or  resolve them all into the efficiency of God; but he teaches that God, in  this world at least, never acts except through those causes. He applies  this doctrine even to miracles, which he regards as effects produced by  second causes of which we are ignorant, that is, by some higher law of  nature. The Scriptures, however, teach that God is not thus bound; that  He operates through second causes, with them, or without them, as He  sees fit. It is a purely arbitrary assumption, that when Christ raised  the dead, healed the lepers, or gave sight to the blind, any second  cause intervened between the effect and the efficiency of his will. What  physical law, or uniformly acting force, operated to make the axe float  at the command of the prophet? or, in that greatest of all miracles,  the original creation of the world.

Fifth edition, London, 1867,  p. 123.      _Mr. Darwin's Theory._    We have not forgotten Mr. Darwin. It seemed desirable, in order to  understand his theory, to see its relation to other theories of the  universe and its phenomena, with which it is more or less connected. His  work on the \"Origin of Species\" does not purport to be philosophical. In  this aspect it is very different from the cognate works of Mr. Spencer.  Darwin does not speculate on the origin of the universe, on the nature  of matter, or of force. He is simply a naturalist, a careful and  laborious observer; skillful in his descriptions, and singularly candid  in dealing with the difficulties in the way of his peculiar doctrine. He  set before himself a single problem, namely, How are the fauna and flora  of our earth to be accounted for? In the solution of this problem, he  assumes:--    1. The existence of matter, although he says little on the subject. Its  existence however, as a real entity, is everywhere taken for granted.    2. He assumes the efficiency of physical causes, showing no disposition  to resolve them into mind-force, or into the efficiency of the First  Cause.    3. He assumes also the existence of life in the form of one or more  primordial germs. He does not adopt the theory of spontaneous  generation. What life is he does not attempt to explain, further than to  quote (p. 326), with approbation, the definition of Herbert Spencer, who  says, \"Life depends on, or consists in, the incessant action and  reaction of various forces,\"--which conveys no very definite idea.    4. To account for the existence of matter and life, Mr. Darwin admits a  Creator. This is done explicitly and repeatedly. Nothing, however, is  said of the nature of the Creator and of his relation to the world,  further than is implied in the meaning of the word.    5. From the primordial germ or germs (Mr. Darwin seems to have settled  down to the assumption of only one primordial germ), all living  organisms, vegetable and animal, including man, on our globe, through  all the stages of its history, have descended.    6. As growth, organization, and reproduction are the functions of  physical life, as soon as the primordial germ began to live, it began  to grow, to fashion organs however simple, for its nourishment and  increase, and for the reproduction, in some way, of living forms like  itself. How all living things on earth, including the endless variety of  plants, and all the diversity of animals--insects, fishes, birds, the  ichthyosaurus, the mastodon, the mammoth, and man--have descended from  the primordial animalcule, he thinks, may be accounted for by the  operation of the following natural laws, viz.:--    First, the law of Heredity, or that by which like begets like. The  offspring are like the parent.    Second, the law of Variation, that is, while the offspring are, in all  essential characteristics, like their immediate progenitor, they  nevertheless vary more or less within narrow limits, from their parent  and from each other. Some of these variations are indifferent, some  deteriorations, some improvements, that is, they are such as enable the  plant or animal to exercise its functions to greater advantage.    Third, the law of Over Production. All plants and animals tend to  increase in a geometrical ratio; and therefore tend to overrun  enormously the means of support. If all the seeds of a plant, all the  spawn of a fish, were to arrive at maturity, in a very short time the  world could not contain them. Hence of necessity arises a struggle for  life. Only a few of the myriads born can possibly live.    Fourth, here comes in the law of Natural Selection, or the Survival of  the Fittest. That is, if any individual of a given species of plant or  animal happens to have a slight deviation from the normal type,  favorable to its success in the struggle for life, it will survive. This  variation, by the law of heredity, will be transmitted to its offspring,  and by them again to theirs. Soon these favored ones gain the  ascendency, and the less favored perish; and the modification becomes  established in the species. After a time another and another of such  favorable variations occur, with like results. Thus very gradually,  great changes of structure are introduced, and not only species, but  genera, families, and orders in the vegetable and animal world, are  produced. Mr. Darwin says he can set no limit to the changes of  structure, habits, instincts, and intelligence, which these simple laws  in the course of millions or milliards of centuries may bring into  existence. He says, \"we cannot comprehend what the figures 60,000,000  really imply, and during this, or perhaps a longer roll of years, the  land and waters have everywhere teemed with living creatures, all  exposed to the struggle for life, and undergoing change.\" (p. 354). \"Mr.  Croll,\" he tells us, \"estimates that about sixty millions of years have  elapsed since the Cambrian period, but this, judging from the small  amount of organic change since the commencement of the glacial period,  seems a very short time for the many and the great mutations of life,  which have certainly occurred since the Cambrian formation; and the  previous one hundred and forty million years can hardly be considered as  sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which  certainly existed toward the close of the Cambrian period.\" (p. 379).  Years in this connection have no meaning. We might as well try to give  the distance of the fixed stars in inches. As astronomers are obliged to  take the diameter of the earth's orbit as the unit of space, so  Darwinians are obliged to take a geological cycle as their unit of  duration.      _Natural Selection._    As Natural Selection which works so slowly is a main element in Mr.  Darwin's theory, it is necessary to understand distinctly what he means  by it. On this point he leaves us no room for doubt. On p. 92, he says:  \"This preservation of favorable variations, and the destruction of  injurious variations, I call Natural Selection, or, the Survival of the  Fittest.\" \"Owing to the struggle (for life) variations, however slight  and from whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable  to the individuals of a species, in their infinitely complex relations  to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will  tend to the preservation of such individuals, and"]]]
