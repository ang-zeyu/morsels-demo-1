In January 1906 the national debt stood as follows:--Outstanding  amount of the consolidated loans, 363,070,500 fr. (L14,522,820); internal  debt, 15,603,774 fr. (L624,151); Eastern Rumelian debt, 1,910,208  (L76,408). In February 1907 a 41/2% loan of 145,000,000 fr. at 85, secured on  the surplus proceeds of the revenues already pledged to the loans of 1902  and 1904, was contracted with the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas  associated with some German and Austrian banks for the conversion of the  loans of 1888 and 1889 (requiring about 53,000,000 fr.) and for railway  construction and other purposes. The total external debt was thus raised to  upwards of 450,000,000 fr. The Eastern Rumelian tribute and the rent of the  Sarambey-Belovo railway, if capitalized at 6%, would represent a further  sum of 50,919,100 fr. (L2,036,765). The national debt was not  disproportionately great in comparison with annual revenue. After the union  with Eastern Rumelia the budget receipts increased from 40,803,262 leva  (L1,635,730) in 1886 to 119,655,507 leva (L4,786,220) in 1904; the  estimated revenue for 1905 was 111,920,000 leva (L4,476,800), of which  41,179,000 (L1,647,160) were derived from direct and 38,610,000  (L1,544,400) from indirect taxation; the estimated expenditure was  111,903,281 leva (L4,476,131), the principal items being: public debt,  31,317,346 (L1,252,693); army, 26,540,720 (L1,061,628); education,  10,402,470 (L416,098); public works, 14,461,171 (L578,446); interior,  7,559,517 (L302,380). The actual receipts in 1905 were 127,011,393 leva. In  1895 direct taxation, which pressed heavily on the agricultural class, was  diminished and indirect taxation (import duties and excise) considerably  increased. In 1906 direct taxation amounted to 9 fr. 92 c., indirect to 8  fr. 58 c., per head of the population. The financial difficulties in which  the country was involved at the close of the 19th century were attributable  not to excessive indebtedness but to heavy outlay on public works, the  army, and education, and to the maintenance of an unnecessary number of  officials, the economic situation being aggravated by a succession of bad  harvests. The war budget during ten years (1888-1897) absorbed the large  sum of 275,822,017 leva (L11,033,300) or 35.77% of the whole national  income within that period. In subsequent years military expenditure  continued to increase; the total during the period since the union with  Eastern Rumelia amounting to 599,520,698 leva (L23,980,800).    _Communications._--In 1878 the only railway in Bulgaria was the  Rustchuk-Varna line (137 m.), constructed by an English company in 1867. In  Eastern Rumelia the line from Sarambey to Philippopolis and the Turkish  frontier (122 m.), with a branch to Yamboli (66 m.), had been built by  Baron Hirsch in 1873, and leased by the Turkish government to the Oriental  Railways Company until 1958. It was taken over by the Bulgarian government  in 1908 (see _History_, below). The construction of a railway from the  Servian frontier at Tzaribrod to the Eastern Rumelian frontier at Vakarel  was imposed on the principality by the Berlin Treaty, but political  difficulties intervened, and the line, which touches Sofia, was not  completed till 1888. In that year the Bulgarian government seized the short  connecting line Belovo-Sarambey belonging to Turkey, and railway  communication between Constantinople and the western capitals was  established. Since that time great progress has been made in railway  construction. In 1888, 240 m. of state railways were open to traffic; in  1899, 777 m.; in 1902, 880 m. Up to October 1908 all these lines were  worked by the state, and, with the exception of the Belovo-Sarambey line  (29 m.), which was worked under a convention with Turkey, were its  property. The completion of the important line Radomir-Sofia-Shumen  (November 1899) opened up the rich agricultural district between the  Balkans and the Danube and connected Varna with the capital. Branches to  Samovit and Rustchuk establish connexion with the Rumanian railway system  on the opposite side of the river. It was hoped, with the consent of the  Turkish government, to extend the line Sofia-Radomir-Kiustendil to Uskub,  and thus to secure a direct route to Salonica and the Aegean. Road  communication is still in an unsatisfactory condition. Roads are divided  into three classes: \"state roads,\" or main highways, maintained by the  government; \"district roads\" maintained by the district councils; and  \"inter-village roads\" (_mezhduselski shosseta_), maintained by the  communes. Repairs are effected by the _corvee_ system with requisitions of  material. There are no canals, and inland navigation is confined to the  Danube. The Austrian _Donaudampschiffahrtsgesellschaft_ and the Russian  _Gagarine_ steamship company compete for the river traffic; the grain trade  is largely served by steamers belonging to Greek merchants. The coasting  trade on the Black Sea is carried on by a Bulgarian steamship company; the  steamers of the Austrian Lloyd, and other foreign companies call at Varna,  and occasionally at Burgas.    The development of postal and telegraphic communication has been rapid. In  1886, 1,468,494 letters were posted, in 1903, 29,063,043. Receipts of posts  and telegraphs in 1886 were L40,975, in 1903 L134,942. In 1903 there were  3261 m. of telegraph lines and 531 m. of telephones.    _Towns._--The principal towns of Bulgaria are Sofia, the capital (Bulgarian  _Sredetz_, a name now little used), pop. in January 1906, 82,187;  Philippopolis, the capital of Eastern Rumelia (Bulg. _Plovdiv_), pop.  45,572; Varna, 37,155; Rustchuk (Bulg. _Russe_), 33,552; Sliven, 25,049;  Shumla (Bulg. _Shumen_), 22,290; Plevna (Bulg. _Pleven_), 21,208;  Stara-Zagora, 20,647; Tatar-Pazarjik, 17,549; Vidin, 16,168; Yamboli (Greek  _Hyampolis_), 15,708; Dobritch (Turkish _Hajiolu-Pazarjik_), 15,369;  Haskovo, 15,061; Vratza, 14,832; Stanimaka (Greek _Stenimachos_), 14,120;  Razgrad, 13,783; Sistova (Bulg. _Svishtov_), 13,408; Burgas, 12,846;  Kiustendil, 12,353; Trnovo, the ancient capital, 12,171. All these are  described in separate articles.    _Population._--The area of northern Bulgaria is 24,535 sq. m.; of Eastern  Rumelia 12,705 sq. m.; of united Bulgaria, 37,240 sq. m. According to the  census of the 12th of January 1906, the population of northern Bulgaria was  2,853,704; of Eastern Rumelia, 1,174,535; of united Bulgaria, 4,028,239 or  88 per sq. m. Bulgaria thus ranks between Rumania and Portugal in regard to  area; between the Netherlands and Switzerland in regard to population: in  density of population it may be compared with Spain and Greece.    The first census of united Bulgaria was taken in 1888: it gave the total  population as 3,154,375. In January 1893 the population was 3,310,713; in  January 1901, 3,744,283.    The movement of the population at intervals of five years has been as  follows:--      ---------------------------------------------------------------------    | Year. |  Marriages.  |  Births  |  Still-  | Deaths. | Natural    |    |       |              |(living). |  born.   |         |Increase.[1]|    ---------------------------------------------------------------------    | 1882  |    19,795    |  74,642  |   300    |  38,884 |   35,758   |    | 1887  |    20,089    |  83,179  |   144    |  39,396 |   43,783   |    | 1892  |    27,553    | 117,883  |   321    | 103,550 |   14,333   |    | 1897  |    29,227    | 149,631  |   858    |  90,134 |   59,497   |    | 1902  |    36,041    | 149,542  |   823    |  91,093 |   58,449   |    ---------------------------------------------------------------------    [1] Excess of births over deaths.    The death-rate shows a tendency to rise. In the five years 1882-1886 the  mean death-rate was 18.0 per 1000; in 1887-1891, 20.4; in 1892-1896, 27.0;  in 1897-1902, 23.92. Infant mortality is high, especially among the  peasants. As the less healthy infants rarely survive, the adult population  is in general robust, hardy and long-lived. The census of January 1901  gives 2719 persons of 100 years and upwards. Young men, as a rule, marry  betore the age of twenty-five, girls before eighteen. The number of  illegitimate births is inconsiderable, averaging only 0.12 of the total.  The population according to sex in 1901 is given as 1,909,567 males and  1,834,716 females, or 51 males to 49 females. A somewhat similar disparity  may be observed in the other countries of the Peninsula. Classified  according to occupation, 2,802,603 persons, or 74.85% of the population,  are engaged in agriculture; 360,834 in various productive industries;  118,824 in the service of the government or the exercise of liberal  professions, and 148,899 in commerce. The population according to race  cannot be stated with absolute accuracy, but it is approximately shown by  the census of 1901, which gives the various nationalities according to  language as follows:--Bulgars, 2,888,219; Turks, 531,240; Rumans, 71,063;  Greeks, 66,635; Gipsies (Tziganes), 89,549; Jews (Spanish speaking),  33,661; Tatars, [v.04 p.0777] 18,884; Armenians, 14,581; other  nationalities, 30,451. The Bulgarian inhabitants of the Peninsula beyond  the limits of the principality may, perhaps, be estimated at 1,500,000 or  1,600,000, and the grand total of the race possibly reaches 5,500,000.    _Ethnology._--The Bulgarians, who constitute 77.14% of the inhabitants of  the kingdom, are found in their purest type in the mountain districts, the  Ottoman conquest and subsequent colonization having introduced a mixed  population into the plains.    The devastation of the country which followed the Turkish invasion resulted  in the extirpation or flight of a large proportion of the Bulgarian  inhabitants of the lowlands, who were replaced by Turkish colonists. The  mountainous districts, however,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#4)"],[1," aid in escape and capture. Only those skilled in the ways of the  wild fully realise how conspicuous amidst foliage, for instance, would  be a uniform colouration. A parti-coloured pattern is extremely  deceptive and thus protective, and for this reason one seldom sees in  Nature a background of one colour; and since the large majority of  animals need concealment, it is necessary for them to be clothed in  patterns that vary.    These variations are especially noticeable in young animals, and furnish  them with a mantle that is practically invisible to predatory enemies  during the time they are left unprotected by their parents. These  protective mantles often differ strikingly in pattern and colouration  from those of their parents, and indicate that the young animals  present the colouration and pattern of their remote forbears. It might  even be said that \"the skins of the fathers are thrust upon the  children, even unto the third and fourth generation!\" In fact, it is  quite probable that they give through this varying colouration the  \"life-history\" of their family.    In all hoofed animals--antelope, deer, horses--the protective  colouration is also adapted to habitat and environment. Most deer belong  to the forest, carefully avoiding the open deserts and staying near  water. They live chiefly in the jungle or scrub, and are usually spotted  with red and white in such a way as to be almost invisible to a casual  observer; some, however, that live in the very shady places are  uniformly dark so as to harmonise with their surroundings. The wild  horses and asses of Central Asia are dun-coloured--corresponding exactly  to their sandy habitat.    The Shakesperian conception of the human world as a stage may be  paralleled in the animal world. Animals, like human beings, have all a  definite role to play in the drama of life. Each is given certain  equipment in form, colour, voice, demeanour, ambitions, desires, and  natural habitat. Some are given much, others but little. Many have  succeeded well in the art of camouflage while endeavouring to make a  success in life. This success has brought the desired opportunity of  mating, rearing young, bequeathing to them their special gifts and  living in ease and comfort.    One of the most successful and striking cases of protective colouration  in young animals is found in wild swine. Here there is longitudinal  striping which marks them from head to tail in broad white bands, over a  background of reddish dark brown. The tapirs have a most unique form of  marking. It is similar in the young of the South American and Malayan  species. Their bodies are exquisitely marked in snow-white bars. At  their extremities these bars are broken up into small dots which tend to  overlap each other. During the daytime these young animals seek the  shade of the bushes and as the spots of sunlight fall upon the ground  they appear so nearly one with their environment as to pass unnoticed by  their enemies. The adults, however, vary greatly one from another in  colouration. The American species is self-coloured, while the Malayan  has the most unique pattern known to the animal world. The  fore-quarters, the head, and the hind-legs are black, while the rest of  the body from the shoulders backwards is of a dirt-white colour.    It has been observed by all students of Nature that bold and gaudy  animals usually have means of defending themselves that make them very  disagreeable to their enemies. They either have poisonous fangs, sharp  spines, ferocious claws, or disagreeable odours. There are still others  that escape destruction because of the bad company with which they are  associated by their enemies.    The reptiles offer us many good examples of mimicry. Most arboreal  lizards wear the colour of the leaves upon which they feed; the same is  true of the whip-snakes and the tiny green tree-frogs. A striking  example of successful camouflage is found in the case of a North  American frog whose home is on lichen-covered rocks and walls, which he  so closely imitates in colour and pattern as to pass unnoticed so long  as he remains quiet. I have seen an immense frog, whose home was in a  damp cave, with large green and black spots over his body precisely like  the spots on the sides of his home.         _Author Note:_ The word \"mimicry\" as used here implies a particular       kind of resemblance only, a resemblance in external appearance,       never internal, a resemblance that deceives. It does not imply       voluntary imitation. Both the words \"mimicry\" and \"imitation\" are       used to imply outward likeness. The object of the outward likeness       or resemblance is to cause a harmless or unprotected animal to be       mistaken for the dangerous one which he oftentimes imitates; or to       aid the unprotected animal in escaping unnoticed among the       surroundings he may simulate.    A splendid example of pure bluff is shown in the case of the harmless  Australian lizard, known scientifically under the name of  _chlamydosaurus kingii_. When he is undisturbed he seems perfectly  inoffensive, but when he becomes angry, he becomes a veritable  fiend-like reptile. In this condition he stands up on his hind legs,  opens his gaping mouth, showing the most terrible teeth, which, by the  way, have never been known to bite anything. Besides this forbidding  display he further adds to his terrible appearance by raising the most  extraordinary frill which is exquisitely decorated in grey, yellow,  scarlet, and blue. This he uses like an umbrella, and if in this way he  does not succeed in frightening away his enemy, he rushes at him, and  lashes him with his saw-like tail. Even dogs are terrified at such  camouflage and leave the successful bluffer alone.    In all parts of the tropics are tree-snakes that lie concealed among the  boughs and shrubs. Most of them are green, and some have richly coloured  bands around their bodies which look not unlike gaily coloured flowers,  and which, no doubt, attract flower-seeking insects and birds. Among  these may be mentioned the deadly-poisonous snakes of the genus _elaps_  of South America. They are so brilliantly provided with bright red and  black bands trimmed with yellow rings that it is not uncommon for a  plant collector to attempt to pick them up for rare orchids!    Wherever these snakes are found, are also found a number of perfectly  harmless snakes, absolutely unlike the dangerous ones in habit and life,  yet coloured precisely the same. The _elaps fulvius_, for example, a  deadly venomous snake of Guatemala, has a body trimmed in simple black  bands on a coral-red ground, and in the same country and always with him  is found a quite harmless snake, which is coloured and banded in the  same identical manner. The terrible and much-feared _elaps lemnicatus_  has the peculiar black bands divided into divisions of three by narrow  yellow rings, thus exactly mimicking a harmless snake, the _pliocerus  elapoides_, both of which live in Mexico. Presumably, the deadly variety  assumes the colouring of the harmless kind in order to deceive intended  victims as to his ferocity.    Surely this is sufficient evidence that colouration and pattern-design  is a useful camouflage device of the great struggle for existence. And  it is safe to assert that any animal that has enemies and still does not  resort to protective colouration or mimicry in some form is entirely  able to protect itself either by its size, strength, ferocity, or by  resorting to safety in numbers. Elephants and rhinoceroses, for example,  are too powerful to be molested when grown, except in the rarest cases,  and are furthermore thoroughly capable of protecting their young.  Hippopotamuses are protected by their immense heads, and are capable of  defending their young from crocodiles even when in the water.    The bison and buffalo, which were once so powerful on the plains of  North America, were protected by their gregarious habits, which  terrorised their enemies--the wolves. Their nurseries were a feature of  their wisdom. These were circular pens where the tall grass was tramped  down by expectant mothers for the protection of their young. This  natural nursery was protected from the inside by sentinels who went  round and round the pen constantly guarding the young not only from the  attack of wolves but also from venturing forth alone too early into the  open unprotected plains. In a similar way the snow-pens of the moose of  the Far North serve to protect them from the hungry hordes of wolves of  which they live in constant danger. This indicates that the annihilation  of the bison and buffalo was due, not to lack of wisdom, but to man's  inhumanity; for, taking advantage of their nurseries, the men crouched  near and concealing themselves in the grass killed not only the mothers  for food but even the young in their savage sport.    The large majority of monkeys are protectively coloured with some shade  of brown or grey, with specially marked faces. Entire packs of  Ceylonese species will, at the slightest alarm, become invisible by  crouching on a palm-tree. One of the most strikingly coloured African  monkeys is jet black with a white bushy tail, and a face surrounded by a  white ring, or mantle of long silky hair. He thus simulates so  strikingly the hanging white lichens upon the trees that he is rarely  seen by his enemies.    A book might be written upon the various ways that animals, when closely  associated with other animals or human beings, imitate them. Darwin says  that \"two species of wolves, which had been reared by dogs, learned to  bark, as does sometimes the jackall,\" and it is well known that certain  dogs, when reared by cats, imitate their habits, even to the licking of  their feet and the washing of their faces. If a mongrel dog associates  with a trained dog for any period of time it is remarkable the progress  he will make. For this "]]]
