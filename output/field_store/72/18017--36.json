If the  reverse side as there shown be compared with the same view as presented  by Short in The North Americans of Antiquity, p. 45, or in MacLean's  Mound-Builders, p. 107, a remarkable discrepancy between the two will be  observed.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Cincinnati Tablet. (Back.) From Squire  and Davis.]    In the former, near the top, is indicated what appears to be a shapeless  depression, formless and unmeaning so far as its resemblance to any  special object is concerned. The authors remark of this side of the  tablet, \"The back of the stone has three deep longitudinal grooves, and  several depressions, evidently caused by rubbing,--probably produced in  sharpening the instrument used, in the sculpture.\" This explanation of  the depressions would seem to be reasonable, although it has been  disputed, and a \"peculiar significance\" (Short) attached to this side of  the tablet. In Short's engraving, while the front side corresponds  closely with the same view given by Squier and Davis, there is a notable  difference observable on the reverse side. For the formless depression  of the Squier and Davis cut not only occupies a somewhat different  position in relation to the top and sides of the tablet, but, as will be  seen by reference to the figure, it assumes a distinct form, having in  some mysterious way been metamorphosed into a figure which oddly enough  suggests the manatee. It does not appear that the attention of  archaeologists has ever been directed to the fact that such a resemblance  exists; nor indeed is the resemblance sufficiently close to justify  calling it a veritable manatee. But with the aid of a little  imagination it may in a rude way suggest that animal, its earless head  and the flipper being the most striking, in fact the only, point of  likeness. Conceding that the figure as given by Short affords a rude  hint of the manatee, the question is how to account for its presence on  this the latest representation of the tablet which, according to Short,  Mr. Guest, its owner, pronounces \"the first correct representations of  the stone.\" The cast of this tablet in the Smithsonian Institution  agrees more closely with Short's representation in respect to the  details mentioned than with that given in the \"Ancient Monuments.\"  Nevertheless, if this cast be accepted as the faithful copy of the  original it has been supposed to be, the engraving in Short's volume is  subject to criticism. In the cast the outline of the figure, while  better defined than Squier and Davis represent it to be, is still very  indefinite, the outline not only being broken into, but being in places,  especially toward the head, indistinguishable from the surface of the  tablet into which it insensibly grades. In the view as found in Short  there is none of this irregularity and indefiniteness of outline, the  figure being perfect and standing out clearly as though just from the  sculptor's hand. As perhaps on the whole the nearest approach to the  form of a manatee appearing on any object claimed to have originated at  the hands of the Mound-Builders, and from the fact that artists have  interpreted its outline so differently, this figure, given by the  latest commentators on the Cincinnati tablet, is interesting, and has  seemed worthy of mention. As, however, the authenticity of the tablet  itself is not above suspicion, but, on the contrary, is believed by many  archaeologists to admit of grave doubts, the subject need not be pursued  further here.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Cincinnati Tablet. (Back.) From  Short.]      TOUCAN.    The _a priori_ probability that the toucan was known to the  Mound-Builders is, of course, much less than that the manatee was, since  no species of toucan occurs farther north than Southern Mexico. Its  distant habitat also militates against the idea that the Mound-Builders  could have acquired a knowledge of the bird from intercourse with  southern tribes, or that they received the supposed toucan pipes by way  of trade. Without discussing the several theories to which the toucan  pipes have given rise, let us first examine the evidence offered as to  the presence in the mounds of sculptures of the toucan.    It is a little perplexing to find at the outset that Squier and Davis,  not content with one toucan, have figured three, and these differing  from each other so widely as to be referable, according to modern  ornithological ideas, to very distinct orders.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Toucan of Squier and Davis.]    The first allusion to the toucan in the Monuments of the Mississippi  Valley is found on page 194, where the authors guardedly remark of a  bird's head in terra cotta (Fig. 79), \"It represents the head of a bird,  somewhat resembling the toucan, and is executed with much spirit.\"    This head is vaguely suggestive of a young eagle, the proportions of the  bill of which, until of some age, are considerably distorted. The  position of the nostrils, however, and the contour of the mandibles,  together with the position of the eyes, show clearly enough that it is a  likeness of no bird known to ornithology. It is enough for our present  purpose to say that in no particular does it bear any conceivable  resemblance to the toucan.    Of the second supposed toucan (Ancient Monuments, p. 260, Fig. 169)  here illustrated, the authors remark:         The engraving very well represents the original, which is       delicately carved from a compact limestone. It is supposed to       represent the toucan--a tropical bird, and one not known to exist       anywhere within the limits of the United States. If we are not       mistaken in supposing it to represent this bird, the remarks made       respecting the sculptures of the manitus will here apply with       double force.    [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Toucan of Squier and Davis.]    This sculpture is fortunately easy of identification. Among several  ornithologists, whose opinions have been asked, not a dissenting voice  has been heard. The bird is a common crow or a raven, and is one of the  most happily executed of the avian sculptures, the nasal feathers, which  are plainly shown, and the general contour of the bill being truly  corvine. It would probably be practically impossible to distinguish a  rude sculpture of a raven from that of a crow, owing to the general  resemblance of the two. The proportions of the head here shown are,  however, those of the crow, and the question of habitat renders it  vastly more likely that the crow was known to the Mound-Builders of  Ohio than that the raven was. What possible suggestion of a toucan is to  be found in this head it is not easy to see.    Turning to page 266 (Fig. 178) another and very different bird is held  up to view as a toucan.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Toucan of Squier and Davis.]    Squier and Davis remark of this sculpture:         From the size of its bill, and the circumstance of its having two       toes before and two behind, the bird intended to be represented       would seem to belong to the zygodactylous order--probably the       toucan. The toucan (Ramphastos of Lin.) is found on this continent       only in the tropical countries of South America.    In contradiction to the terms of their description their own figure, as  will be noticed, shows _three_ toes in front and two behind, or a total  of five, which makes the bird an ornithological curiosity, indeed.  However, as the cast in the Smithsonian collection shows three toes in  front and one behind, it is probably safe to assume that the additional  hind toe was the result of mistake on the part of the modern artist, so  that four may be accepted as its proper quota. The mistake then  chargeable to the above authors is that in their discussion they  transferred one toe from before and added it behind. In this curious way  came their zygodactylous bird.    This same pipe is figured by Stevens in Flint Chips, p. 426, Fig. 5. The  wood-cut is a poor one, and exhibits certain important changes, which,  on the assumption that the pipe is at all well illustrated by the cast  in the Smithsonian, reflects more credit on the artist's knowledge of  what a toucan ought to look like than on his fidelity as an exact  copyist.    The etchings across the upper surface of the base of the pipe, miscalled  fingers, are not only made to assume a hand-like appearance but the  accommodating fancy of the artist has provided a roundish object in the  palm, which the bird appears about to pick up. The bill, too, has been  altered, having become rounded and decidedly toucan-like, while the tail  has undergone abbreviation, also in the direction of likeness to the  toucan. In short, much that was lacking in the aboriginal artist's  conception towards the likeness of a toucan has in this figure been  supplied by his modern interpreter.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Toucan as figured by Stevens.]    This cut corresponds with the cast in the Smithsonian collection, in  having the normal number of toes, four--three in front and one behind.  This departure from the arrangement common to the toucan family, which  is zygodactylous, seems to have escaped Stevens's attention. At least he  volunteers no explanation of the discrepancy, being, doubtless,  influenced in his acceptance of the bird as a toucan by the statements  of others.    Wilson follows the cut of Squier and Davis, and represents the bird with  five toes, stating that the toucan is \"imitated with considerable  accuracy.\" He adds: \"The most important deviation from correctness of  detail is, it has three toes instead of two before, although the two are  correctly represented behind.\" How Wilson is guided to the belief that  the sculptor's mistake consists in adding a toe in front instead of one  behind it would be difficult to explain, unless, indeed, he felt the  necessity of having a toucan at all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18187"],[0,"Hebrew Life and Times (#4)"],[1,"Hebrews.      BABYLONIAN CIVILIZATION    Babylonia is one of the two lands (Egypt being the other) where human  civilization began. This rich alluvial plain, lying between the lower  Tigris and the lower Euphrates Rivers, became the home of a gifted  race which at least in its later history through intermarriage was in  part Semitic and thus related to the Hebrews. Several thousand years  before Christ the people of this land began to till the soil, to  control the floods in the rivers by means of irrigating canals, to  make bricks out of the abundant clay and with them to build houses and  cities. They also invented a system of writing upon clay tablets.  These were baked in the sun after the letters were inscribed.  Commercial records and written laws and histories were thus made  possible and in time a varied literature was created. Whole libraries  of these baked clay tablets have been unearthed and deciphered by  modern investigators.    =Evidences of ancient culture.=--By B.C. 4000 there flourished on the  plains of Babylonia a splendid civilization in many ways similar to  ours to-day. The people raised enormous crops of grain and exported it  by ship and caravan to distant lands. They had developed to a high  point the arts of the weaver, the dyer, the potter, the metal worker,  and the carpenter. They had devised a system of geometry for the  measuring of their wheat fields and city streets. Through astronomy  they had worked out the calendar of days, weeks, months, and years  which with modifications we still use. They had erected magnificent  temples to their gods. From translations of the inscriptions on their  clay tablets we can gain a clear knowledge of their life and customs.  Here, for example, is a translation of part of a letter from a son to  a father asking for more money: \"My father, you said, 'When I shall go  to Dur-Ammi-Zaduga, I will send you a sheep and five minas of silver.'  But you have not sent. Let my father send and let not my heart be  vexed.... To the gods Shamash and Marduk I pray for my father.\" If we  forget the outlandish-sounding names, how natural this seems! How like  our boys was this boy who wrote the queer-looking characters on this  bit of clay which we may hold in our hand!      THE FAULTS OF THE BABYLONIAN CIVILIZATION    With all their gifts and achievements there were certain great evils  in Babylonian life. For one thing they were inclined to be greedy and  covetous. They lived on a soil almost incredibly rich, and they were  constantly increasing their wealth by trade. Babylonian merchants or  their agents were to be found in almost every city and town of western  Asia and perhaps even as far east as China. Of the vast mass of their  written records which have been collected in our museums, the  majority are business documents and records of contracts. Many of them  tell the story of hard bargains. Professor Maspero declares that these  records \"reveal to us a people greedy of gain, exacting, and almost  exclusively absorbed by material concerns.\"    =Slavery.=--Moreover, the wealth of the nation was not fairly  distributed but was more and more in the hands of the favored few, the  great nobles, and their friends. The fields were not tilled by  independent farmers. There were, instead, a few great estates which  were rented out to tenants. The actual work, both on the fields and in  the towns, was more and more performed by slaves. Some of these were  captives who had been taken in war. Others were native Babylonians who  had been sold into slavery for debt. So it had come about that  Babylonian society had set like plaster into a hard mold with the king  and the wealthy nobles on top and the poor peasants and slaves below.  This state of things was fastened all the more firmly on the people by  strong kings such as Hammurabi, who lived about B.C. 2000 and who  unified the country under a powerful central government with his own  city, Babylon, as the capital.      A SHEPHERD WITH IDEALS    About the time of Hammurabi's reign, if we follow the account related  in the book of Genesis, there lived among the nomads on the plains  west of the city of Ur a man named Abraham. If Hammurabi ever heard of  him, which is improbable, he looked down upon him as of no account.  Yet Abraham wielded a greater influence for the future welfare of  humanity than all the princes of Babylon. For, discontented with  Babylonian life, he was the earliest pioneer in a movement toward a  civilization of a different and better type. And the sons of Hammurabi  have yet to reckon with Abraham and his ambitions.    =Discontent among the shepherds.=--Many of Abraham's people, no doubt,  were discontented in Babylonia. A shepherd's life is monotonous and  hard. When they went to market they saw comforts and luxuries on every  hand. Yet the money they received from the wool merchants of Ur gave  no promise of larger opportunities in life for any shepherd boy. So,  at length when Abraham said to them, \"Come, let us leave this  country,\" they were ready to answer, \"Lead on, and we will follow!\" So  it came to pass that Abraham's clan set out northwest, toward Haran,  in what is now called Mesopotamia, and finally after some years of  migration found themselves camping on the hillsides of Canaan,  southeast of the Mediterranean Sea.    =Ideals represented in Abraham.=--But it is not as a leader of fortune  hunters that Abraham is pictured in the Bible. No doubt he and his  clansmen hoped to better their condition. But Abraham was a dreamer  and a man of deep religious faith. He believed that he was being  guided by his God. And he believed that in accordance with God's plan  his descendants in the land to which they had come would become a  great nation. Best of all, it seems probable that he dreamed of a  nation different from Babylonia. Certainly he is described as a  different kind of a man from the typical Babylonian. In some respects,  to be sure, judging by our Christian standards, he had serious  shortcomings. He did not scruple to deceive a foreigner, nor to treat  harshly a slave. His ideas as to the character of God were far below  those revealed by Christ. Yet he had the Hebrew gift for home and  family life. He was a good father to his son. And he put a higher  value on personal friendship and kindly family relations than on  property interests. When his herdsmen quarreled with those of his  nephew, Lot, he said to the latter with dignified generosity and  common sense, \"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and  thee ... for we are brethren. Is not the whole land before thee?  Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left  hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou take the right hand,  then I will go to the left.\" Just what Abraham looked forward to, we,  of course, do not know. Probably his ideas were vague. Yet it seems  that such men as he must have dreamed of a nation great in faith as  well as in material wealth; a nation in which money would not be  considered more important than justice and kindness; in which home  life might be sweet and loving, free from the fear of want or the  blighting influence of greed; and in which the door of opportunity  would always be kept open even for the humblest.    At any rate, some centuries after the time when Abraham is supposed to  have lived, we find a group of shepherd tribes living in and around  Canaan, who believed themselves to be descended from the twelve sons  of Jacob, Abraham's grandson, and among whom there was the tradition  of a divinely guided pilgrimage from Babylonia to Canaan under  Abraham's leadership just as we have described. It is a great thing to  have memories of noble parents and traditions of heroic ancestors.  These the Hebrews had from the very beginning.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Look up in any good Bible dictionary, the articles on Babylonia and  Hammurabi.    2. Read Genesis 12, 15, and 24 and form your own opinion of Abraham as  a husband and father.    3. What was Abraham's most valuable contribution to history?    4. From any map of western Asia, draw a sketch map showing the Nile,  Euphrates, and Tigris Rivers, the Mediterranean Sea, and the general  direction of Abraham's pilgrimage.    5. Where in the Bible is found the sentence spoken by Abraham to Lot,  and quoted in this chapter?          CHAPTER IV    A STRUGGLE AGAINST TYRANNY      Although they had escaped for a time from Babylonian tyranny, the  descendants of Abraham in Canaan found themselves somewhat within the  range of the influence of the other great civilized power of that day,  that is, Egypt. Egyptian officers collected tribute from rich  Canaanite cities. The roads that led to Egypt were thronged with  caravans going to and fro. By and by, a series of dry seasons drove  several of the Hebrew tribes down these highways to Egypt in the  search of food. The story of Joseph tells how they settled there.[1]  They were hospitably received by the king (or Pharaoh, which was the  Egyptian word for \"king\"), and were allowed to pasture their flocks on  the plains called the land of Goshen in the extreme northeast of the  country west of what we now call the Isthmus of Suez. For some decades  or more they lived here, following their old occupation--sheep-raising.    =Egyptian civilization.=--Egypt was in many ways like Babylonia. In  Egypt too a great civilization had sprung up many millenniums before  Christ. In some ways it was an even greater civilization than that of  Babylonia. Egyptian sculptors and architects erected stone temples  whose grandeur has never been surpassed. Many of them are still  standing and are among the world's treasures. It would seem that there  was somewhat more of love of beauty and somewhat less of greed for  money among the Egyptians than among the Babylonians.
