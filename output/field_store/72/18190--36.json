The ordinary methods which he  would apply to a folk-song break down in the case of a labour-song.  Manual actions were the soul of the shanty; eliminate these and you  have only the skeleton of what was once a living thing. It is quite  possible, I know, to push this line of argument too far, but every one  who knows anything about seamanship must feel that a shanty nowadays  cannot be other than a pale reflection of what it once was.    That is why I deprecate the spurious authenticity conferred by print  upon isolated versions of shanties sung by individual old men. When  the originals are available it seems to me pedantic and academic to  put into print the comic mispronunciations of well-known words by old  and uneducated seamen.    And this brings me to the last difficulty which confronts the  collector with no previous knowledge of shanties. As a mere matter of  dates, any sailors now remaining from sailing ship days must  necessarily be very old men. I have found that their octogenarian  memories are not always to be trusted. On one occasion an old man sang  quite glibly a tune which was in reality a _pasticcio_ of three  separate shanties all known to me. I have seen similar results in  print, since the collector arrived too late upon the scene to be able  to detect the tricks which an old man's memory played him.    One final remark about collectors which has an important bearing upon  the value of their work. There were two classes of sailing vessels  that sailed from English ports--the coaster or the mere collier that  plied between the Tyne or Severn and Boulogne, and the Southspainer,  under which term was comprised all deep-sea vessels. On the collier or  short-voyage vessel the crew was necessarily a small one, and the  shanty was more or less of a makeshift, adapted to the capacity of the  limited numbers of the crew. Purely commercial reasons precluded the  engagement of any shantyman specially distinguished for his musical  attainments. Consequently, so far as the shanty was concerned, 'any  old thing would do.' On the Southspainer, however, things were very  different. The shantyman was usually a person of considerable musical  importance, who sang his songs in a more or less finished manner; his  melodies were clean, clear-cut things, without any of the  folk-songer's quavers and wobbles. I heard them in the 'seventies and  'eighties before the sailing-ship had vanished, consequently I give  them as they were then sung--undisfigured and unobscured by the  mixture of twirls, quavers, and hiccups one hears from octogenarian  mariners who attempt them to-day.      METHOD OF SINGING    So far as the music was concerned, a shanty was a song with a chorus.  The song was rendered by one singer, called the shantyman, and the  chorus by the sailors who performed their work in time with the music.  So far as the words were concerned there was usually a stereotyped  opening of one or more verses. For all succeeding verses the shantyman  improvized words, and his topics were many and varied, the most  appreciated naturally being personal allusions to the crew and  officers, sarcastic criticism on the quality of the food, wistful  references to the good time coming on shore, etc. There was no need  for any connection or relevancy between one verse or another, nor were  rhymes required. The main thing that mattered was that the rhythm  should be preserved and that the words should be such as would keep  the workers merry or interested. Once the stereotyped verses were got  rid of and the improvization began, things became so intimate and  personal as to be unprintable. It was a curious fact that such shanty  words as lent themselves most to impropriety were wedded to tunes  either of fine virility or haunting sweetness.    For 'pull-and-haul' shanties the shantyman took up his position near  the workers and announced the shanty, sometimes by singing the first  line. This established the tune to which they were to supply the  chorus. For capstan shanties he usually did the same. He frequently  sat on the capstan, but so far as I can learn he more usually took up  his position on or against the knightheads. The importance of the  shantyman could not be overestimated. A good shantyman with a pretty  wit was worth his weight in gold. He was a privileged person, and was  excused all work save light or odd jobs.      THE WORDS OF SHANTIES    I have already noted the shanties which were derived from popular  songs, also the type which contained a definite narrative. Except  where a popular song was adapted, the form was usually rhymed or more  often unrhymed couplets. The topics were many and varied, but the  chief ones were: (1) popular heroes such as Napoleon, and 'Santy  Anna.' That the British sailor of the eighteenth century should hate  every Frenchman and yet make a hero of Bonaparte is one of the  mysteries which has never been explained. Another mystery is the  fascination which Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (1795-1876) exercised  over the sailor. He was one of the many Mexican 'Presidents' and was  defeated by the American General Taylor in 1847. That did not prevent  the British sailor presenting him in the light of an invariable victor  until he was led out to be shot (he really died a natural death) by  persons unknown. (2) The sailor had mythical heroes too, e.g. 'Ranzo,'  already mentioned, and 'Stormy,' who was the theme of many shanties.  No sailor could ever give the least explanation of them, and so they  remain the last echoes of long forgotten sagas. (3) High-sounding,  poetic, or mysterious words, such as 'Lowlands,' 'Shenandoah,'  'Rolling river,' 'Hilo,' 'Mobile Bay,' 'Rio Grande,' had a great  fascination, as their constant recurrence in many shanties shows. (4)  The sailor also sang much of famous ships, such as 'The Flying Cloud,'  'The Henry Clay,' or 'The Victory,' and famous lines, such as 'The  Black Ball.' Even famous shipowners were celebrated in song, as  witness 'Mr. John Tapscott,' in 'We're all bound to go.' (5) Love  affairs, in which 'Lizer Lee' and other damsels constantly figured,  were an endless topic. (6) But chiefly did Jack sing of affairs  connected with his ship. He never sang of 'the rolling main,' 'the  foaming billows,' 'the storm clouds,' etc. These are the  stock-in-trade of the landsman; they were too real for the sailor to  sing about. He had the instinct of the primitive man which forbids  mention of natural forces of evil omen. But intimate or humorous  matters such as the failings of his officers, the quality of the food,  the rate of pay, or other grievances were treated with vigour and  emphasis. Like the Britisher of to-day, he would put up with any  hardship so long as he were permitted to grouse about it. The  shantyman gave humorous expression to this grousing, which deprived it  of the element of sulks. Steam let off in this way was a wholesome  preventive of mutiny.    The choruses were usually jingles, with no relevance save maintenance  of the rhythm.    One feature of the words may be noted. The sailor's instinct for  romance was so strong that in his choruses, at least, no matter how  'hair-curling' the solo might be, he always took the crude edge off  the concrete and presented it as an abstraction if possible. For  example, he knew perfectly well that one meaning of 'to blow' was to  knock or kick. He knew that discipline in Yankee packets was  maintained by corporeal methods, so much so that the Mates, to whom  the function of knocking the 'packet rats' about was delegated, were  termed first, second, and third 'blowers,' or strikers, and in the  shanty he sang 'Blow the man down.' 'Knock' or 'kick,' as I have  recently seen in a printed collection, was too crudely realistic for  him. In like manner the humorous title, 'Hog's-eye,' veiled the coarse  intimacy of the term which it represented. And that is where, when  collecting shanties from the 'longshore' mariner of to-day, I find  him, if he is uneducated, so tiresome. He not only wants to explain to  me as a landsman the exact meaning (which I know already) of terms  which the old type of sailor, with his natural delicacy, avoided  discussing, but he tries where possible to work them into his shanty,  a thing the sailor of old time never did. So that when one sees in  print expressions which sailors did not use, it is presumptive  evidence that the collector has been imposed upon by a salt of the  'sea lawyer' type.    Perhaps I ought to make this point clearer. Folk-song collecting was  once an artistic pursuit. Now it has become a flourishing industry of  high commercial value. From the commercial point of view it is  essential that results should be printed and circulated as widely as  possible. Some knowledge of seamanship is an absolute necessity where  folk-shanties are concerned. The mere collector nowadays does not  possess that knowledge; it is confined to those who have had practical  experience of the sea, but who will never print their experiences. The  mere collector _must_ print his versions. What is unprinted must  remain unknown; what is printed is therefore accepted as  authoritative, however misleading it may be. Many highly educated men,  of whom Captain Whall is the type, have followed the sea. It is from  them that the only really trustworthy information is forthcoming. But  so far as I can judge, it is uneducated men who appear to sing to  collectors nowadays, and I have seen many a quiet smile on the lips of  the educated sailor when he is confronted with printed versions of the  uneducated seaman's performances. For example, one of the best known  of all shanties is 'The Hog's-eye man'; I have seen this entitled 'The  Hog-eyed man,' and even 'The Ox-eyed man.' Every old sailor knew the  meaning of the term. Whall and Bullen, who were both sailors, use the  correct expression, 'Hog-eye.' The majority"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20777"],[0,"R.
