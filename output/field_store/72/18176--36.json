Why, it rings beneath the foot, like granite. Long  live winter! Long live the ice! This will last till doomsday! And look  at the sky: is it day? is it night? what is it? A pale, misty light  steals over the snow; one would say that the sun is dying!    No, thou art not dying, O liberty! One of these days, at the moment  when thou art least expected, at the very hour when they shall have  most utterly forgotten thee, thou wilt rise!--O dazzling vision! the  star-like face will suddenly be seen issuing from the earth,  resplendent on the horizon! Over all that snow, over all that ice, over  that hard, white plain, over that water become rock, over all that  wretched winter, thou wilt cast thy arrow of gold, thy ardent and  effulgent ray! light, heat, life! And then, listen! hear you that dull  sound? hear you that crashing noise, all-pervading and formidable? 'Tis  the breaking up of the ice! 'tis the melting of the Neva! 'tis the  river resuming its course! 'tis the water, living, joyous, and  terrible, heaving up the hideous, dead ice, and crushing it.--'Twas  granite, said you; see, it splinters like glass! 'tis the breaking up  of the ice, I tell you: 'tis the truth returning, 'tis progress  recommencing, 'tis mankind resuming its march, and uprooting, carrying  off, mingling, crushing and drowning in its waves, like the wretched  furniture of a submerged hovel, not only the brand-new empire of Louis  Bonaparte, but all the structures and all the work of the eternal  antique despotism! Look on these things as they are passing. They are  vanishing for ever. You will never behold them again. That book, half  submerged, is the old code of iniquity; that sinking framework is the  throne; that other framework, floating off, is the scaffold!    And for this immense engulfment, this supreme victory of life over  death, what was needed? One glance from thee, O sun! one of thy rays, O  liberty!          V    BIOGRAPHY      Charles-Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, born at Paris, on April 20, 1808, is  the son of Hortense de Beauharnais, who was married by the Emperor  to Louis-Napoleon, King of Holland. In 1831, taking part in the  insurrections in Italy, where his elder brother was killed, Louis  Bonaparte attempted to overthrow the Papacy. On the 30th of October,  1836, he attempted to overthrow Louis Philippe. He failed at Strasburg,  and, being pardoned by the King, he embarked for America, leaving his  accomplices behind him to be tried. On the 11th of November he wrote:  \"The King, _in his clemency_, has ordered me taken to America;\" he  declared himself \"keenly affected by the King's _generosity_,\" adding:  \"Certainly, we were all culpable towards the government in taking up  arms against it, but _the greatest culprit was myself_;\" and he  concluded thus: \"I was _guilty_ towards the government, and the  government has been _generous_ to me.\"[1] He returned from America, and  went to Switzerland, got himself appointed captain of artillery at  Berne, and a citizen of Salenstein, in Thurgovia; equally avoiding,  amid the diplomatic complications occasioned by his presence, to call  himself a Frenchman, or to avow himself a Swiss, and contenting  himself, in order to satisfy the French government, with stating in a  letter, dated the 20th of August, 1838, that he lived \"almost alone,\"  in the house \"where his mother died,\" and that it was \"his firm  determination to remain quiet.\"          [1] A letter read at the Court of Assize by the advocate Parquin,        who, after reading it, exclaimed: \"Among the numerous faults of        Louis-Napoleon, we may not, at least, include ingratitude.\"    On the 6th of August, 1840 he disembarked at Boulogne, parodying the  disembarkation at Cannes, with the _petit chapeau_ on his head,[2]  carrying a gilt eagle on the end of a flag-staff, and a live eagle in  a cage, proclamations galore, and sixty valets, cooks, and grooms,  disguised as French soldiers with uniforms bought at the Temple, and  buttons of the 42nd Regiment of the Line, made in London. He scatters  money among the passers-by in the streets of Boulogne, sticks his hat  on the point of his sword, and himself cries, \"Vive l'Empereur!\" fires  a pistol shot at an officer,[3] which hits a soldier and knocks out  three of his teeth, and finally runs away. He is taken into custody;  there are found on his person 500,000 francs, in gold and  bank-notes;[4] the procureur-general, Franck-Carre, says to him in  the Court of Peers: \"You have been tampering with the soldiers, and  distributing money to purchase treason.\" The peers sentenced him to  perpetual imprisonment. He was confined at Ham. There his mind seemed  to take refuge within itself and to mature: he wrote and published some  books, instinct, notwithstanding a certain ignorance of France and of  the age, with democracy and with progress: \"The Extinction of  Pauperism,\" \"An Analysis of the Sugar Question,\" \"Napoleonic Ideas,\" in  which he made the Emperor a \"humanitarian.\" In a treatise entitled  \"Historical Fragments,\" he wrote thus: \"I am a citizen before I am a  Bonaparte.\" Already in 1852, in his book \"Political Reveries,\" he had  declared himself a republican. After five years of captivity, he  escaped from the prison of Ham, disguised as a mason, and took refuge  in England.          [2] Court of Peers. Attempt of the 6th August, 1840, page 140,        evidence of Geoffroy, grenadier.          [3] Captain Col. Puygellier, who had said to him: \"You are a        conspirator and a traitor.\"          [4] Court of Peers. Evidence of the witness Adam, Mayor of        Boulogne.    February arrived; he hailed the Republic, took his seat as a  representative of the people in the Constituent Assembly, mounted the  tribune on the 21st of September, 1848, and said: \"All my life shall  be devoted to strengthening the Republic;\" published a manifesto which  may be summed up in two lines: liberty, progress, democracy, amnesty,  abolition of the decrees of proscription and banishment; was elected  President by 5,500,000 votes, solemnly swore allegiance to the  Constitution on the 20th of December, 1848, and on the 2nd of December,  1851, shattered that Constitution. In the interval he had destroyed  the Roman republic, and had restored in 1849 that Papacy which in 1831  he had essayed to overthrow. He had, besides, taken nobody knows how  great a share in the obscure affair of the lottery of the gold ingots.  A few weeks previous to the _coup d'etat_, this bag of gold became  transparent, and there was visible within it a hand greatly resembling  his. On December 2, and the following days, he, the executive power,  assailed the legislative power, arrested the representatives, drove  out the assembly, dissolved the Council of State, expelled the high  court of justice, suppressed the laws, took 25,000,000 francs from  the bank, gorged the army with gold, swept the streets of Paris with  grape-shot, and terrorized France. Since then, he has proscribed  eighty-four representatives of the people; stolen from the Princes of  Orleans the property of their father, Louis Philippe, to whom he owed  his life; decreed despotism in fifty-eight articles, under the name of  Constitution; throttled the Republic; made the sword of France a gag  in the mouth of liberty; pawned the railways; picked the pockets of  the people; regulated the budget by ukase; transported to Africa and  Cayenne ten thousand democrats; banished to Belgium, Spain, Piedmont,  Switzerland, and England forty thousand republicans, brought grief to  every heart and the blush of shame to every brow.    Louis Bonaparte thinks that he is mounting the steps of a throne; he  does not perceive that he is mounting those of a scaffold.          VI    PORTRAIT      Louis Bonaparte is a man of middle height, cold, pale, slow in his  movements, having the air of a person not quite awake. He has  published, as we have mentioned before, a moderately esteemed treatise  on artillery, and is thought to be acquainted with the handling of  cannon. He is a good horseman. He speaks drawlingly, with a slight  German accent. His histrionic abilities were displayed at the Eglinton  tournament. He has a heavy moustache, covering his smile, like that of  the Duke of Alva, and a lifeless eye like that of Charles IX.    Judging him apart from what he calls his \"necessary acts,\" or his  \"great deeds,\" he is a vulgar, commonplace personage, puerile,  theatrical, and vain. Those persons who are invited to St. Cloud, in  the summer, receive with the invitation an order to bring a morning  toilette and an evening toilette. He loves finery, display, feathers,  embroidery, tinsel and spangles, big words, and grand titles,--everything  that makes a noise and glitter, all the glassware of power. In his  capacity of cousin to the battle of Austerlitz, he dresses as a  general. He cares little about being despised; he contents himself with  the appearance of respect.    This man would tarnish the background of history; he absolutely sullies  its foreground. Europe smiled when, glancing at Haiti, she saw this  white Soulouque appear. But there is now in Europe, in every  intelligent mind, abroad as at home, a profound stupor, a feeling, as  it were, of personal insult; for the European continent, whether it  will or no, is responsible for France, and whatever abases France  humiliates Europe.    Before the 2nd of December, the leaders of the Right used freely to say  of Louis Bonaparte: \"_He is an idiot._\" They were mistaken. To be sure  that brain of his is awry, and has gaps in it, but one can discern here  and there thoughts consecutive and concatenate. It is a book whence  pages have been torn. Louis Napoleon has a fixed idea; but a fixed idea  is not idiocy; he knows what he wants, and he goes straight to it;  through justice, through law, through reason, through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20587"],[0,"Integration of the Armed Forces, 1940-1965 (#4)"],[1,"... 81    Lt.
