The French would have been satisfied in  the West as they had been in the North, with their forts and trading  stations, and the Indians could have hunted, and fished, and trapped, as  they had always done. In fact, the French people would often have become  like them. They understood the Indians and liked them; sometimes they  mated with them, and their children grew up as wild as their mothers.  The religion that the French priests taught the Indians, pleased while  it awed them, and it scarcely changed their native customs.    Wherever the English came, the Indians' woods were wasted, and the  Indians were driven out of the land.    The English tried neither to save their souls nor to win their hearts;  they both hated and despised the savages, and ruthlessly destroyed them.  Now, when the smoldering strife between the French and English in  the West burst into an open flame of war between the two nations, the  Western tribes took the side of those whom reason and instinct taught  them to know as their best friends.    But ten years after Celoron visited Ohio, Wolfe captured Quebec, and  France gave up to England not only the whole of Canada, but the whole of  the vast region between the lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, and kept for  herself only the Province of Louisiana. The Indians were left to  their fate, and they made what terms they could with the English. They  promised peace, but they broke their promises, and constantly harassed  the outlying English settlements. At one time they joined together under  the great chief Pontiac, and tried to win back the West for themselves.  The French forts had been ceded to Great Britain and garrisoned with  British troops, and the allied Indians now took all of these but Detroit  and Fort Pitt. In the end they failed, and then they made peace again,  but still they kept up their forays along the English borders. They  stole horses and cattle, they burned houses and barns, they killed men,  women, and children, or carried them off into captivity. In the Ohio  country alone their captives counted hundreds, though the right number  could never be known, for they could easily be kept out of the way when  the tribes were summoned to give them up.    It was the same story in the West that it had been in the East, and the  North, and the South, wherever the savages fell upon the lonely farms or  the scattered hamlets of the frontiers, and it was not ended until our  own day, when the Indians were at last shut up in reservations.    [Illustration: Indians carry off the women 036R]    It was their custom to carry off the women and children. If the  children were hindered the march of their mothers, or if they cried and  endangered or annoyed their captors, they were torn a hawked, or their  brains were dashed out against the trees. But if they were well grown,  and strong enough to keep up with the rest, they were hurried sometimes  hundreds of miles into the wilderness. There the fate of all prisoners  was decided in solemn council of the tribe. If any men had been taken,  especially such as had made a hard fight for their freedom and had given  proof of their courage, they were commonly tortured to death by fire in  celebration of the victory won over them; though it sometimes happened  that young men who had caught the fancy or affection of the Indians were  adopted by the fathers of sons lately lost in battle. The older women  became the slaves and drudges of the squaws and the boys and girls were  parted from their mothers and scattered among the savage families. The  boys grew up hunters and trappers, like the Indian boys, and the girls  grew up like the Indian girls, and did the hard work which the warriors  always left to the women. The captives became as fond of their wild,  free life as the savages themselves, and they found wives and husbands  among the youths and maidens of their tribe. If they were given up to  their own people, as might happen in the brief intervals of peace, they  pined for the wilderness, which called to their homesick hearts, and  sometimes they stole back to it. They seem rarely to have been held for  ransom, as the captives of the Indians of the Western plains were in our  time. It was a tie of real love that bound them and their savage friends  together, and it was sometimes stronger than the tie of blood. But this  made their fate all the crueler to their kindred; for whether they lived  or whether they died, they were lost to the fathers and mothers, and  brothers and sisters whom they had been torn from; and it was little  consolation to these that they had found human mercy and tenderness in  the breasts of savages who in all else were like ravening beasts. It  was rather an agony added to what they had already suffered to know that  somewhere in the trackless forests to the westward there was growing up  a child who must forget them. The time came when something must be done  to end all this and to put a stop to the Indian attacks on the frontiers  of Pennsylvania and Virginia. The jealous colonies united with the  jealous mother country, and a little army of British regulars and  American recruits was sent into Ohio under the lead of Colonel Henry  Bouquet to force the savages to give up their captives.    This officer, who commanded the king's troops at Philadelphia, was a  young Swiss who had fought in the great wars of Europe, in the service  of the king of Piedmont and of the Dutch republic, before he was given a  commission by the king of Great Britain. He had distinguished himself  by his bravery, his skill, and his good sense. He seems to have been the  first European commander to disuse the rules of European warfare, and  to take a lesson from our pioneers in fighting the Indians, and the year  before he set out for the Ohio country, he had beaten the tribes in a  battle that taught them to respect him. They found that they had no such  wrong-headed leader as Braddock to deal with; and that they could not  hope to ambush Bouquet's troops, and shoot them down like cattle in a  pen; and the news of his coming spread awe among them.    He gathered his forces together at Fort Pitt, after many delays. At one  time a full third of his colonial recruits deserted him, but he waited  till he had made up their number again, and then he started at the head  of fifteen hundred men, on the 3d of October, 1764. A body of Virginians  went first in three scouting parties, one on the right and one on the  left, to beat up the woods for lurking enemies, and one in the middle  with a guide, to lead the way. Then came the pioneers with their axes,  and two companies of light infantry followed, to clear the way for the  main body of the troops. A column of British regulars, two deep, marched  in the center with a file of regulars on their right, and a file of  Pennsylvanian recruits on their left.    Two platoons of regulars came after these; then came a battalion of  Pennsylvanians in single file on the right and left, and between them  the convoy, with the ammunition and tools first, then the officers'  baggage and tents, then the sheep and oxen in separate droves for the  subsistence of the army, then the pack horses with other provisions.  A party of light horsemen followed, and last of all another body of  Virginians brought up the rear. The men marched in silence, six feet  from one another, ready, if any part of the force halted, to face  outward, and prepare to meet an attack.    The Indians hung upon Bouquet's march in large numbers at first, but  when they saw the perfect order and discipline of his army, and the  knowledge of their own tactics which he showed in disposing his men,  they fell away, and he kept his course unmolested, so that in two weeks  he reached a point in the Ohio country which he could now reach in two  hours, if he took rail from Pittsburg direct. But the wonder is for  what he did then, and not for what he could do now. His two weeks' march  through the wilderness was a victory such as had never been achieved  before, and it moved the imagination of the Indians more than if he had  fought them the whole way.    His quiet firmness in establishing his force in the heart of their  country, where they had gathered the strength of their tribes from all  the outlying regions, must have affected them still more. At the first  halt he made on the Muskingum, they sent some of their chiefs to parley  with him, but he gave them short and stern answers, bidding them be  ready to bring in their captives from every tribe and family; and again  took up his march along the river till he reached the point where the  Tuscarawas and Waldhonding meet to form the Muskingum. There his axmen  cleared a space in the forest, and his troops built a town, rather than  pitched a camp. They put up four redoubts, one at each corner of the  town, and fortified it with a strong stockade. Within this they built a  council house, where the Indians could come and make speeches to  their hearts' content, and deliver up their captives. Three separate  buildings, one for the captives from each of the colonies, with the  officers' quarters, the soldiers' cabins, the kitchens, and the ovens,  were inclosed within the fort, and the whole was kept in a neatness and  order such as the savages had never seen, with military severity.    The tribes soon began to bring in their prisoners, each chief giving up  the captives of his tribe with long harangues, and many gifts of wampum,  as pledges of good faith, and promises of a peace never to be broken.  They said they had not merely buried the hatchet now, where it might  sometime be dug up, but they had thrown it into the sky to the Great  Spirit, who would never give it back again.

A number of people came in and made him take off his stockings to  exhibit his feet, and then his jacket and waistcoat to show them how his  clothes were put off and on.    Day after day he was treated in the same manner.  He was also compelled  to undertake various offices.  First, he was told to shave the head of  one of the young princes, but, unaccustomed to use a razor, he soon cut  the boy's skin, on seeing which the king ordered him to desist.    On the 18th his black servant, Johnson, was brought in as as a prisoner  before Ali by some Moors, who had also seized a bundle of his clothes  left at Jarra.  Of these Ali took possession, and Park was unable to  obtain even a clean shirt or anything he required.  The Moors next  stripped him of his gold, his watch, the amber he had remaining and one  of his pocket compasses.  Fortunately he had hidden the other in the  sand near his hut.  This, with the clothes on his back, was the only  thing Ali now left him.    Ali, on examining the compass, wished to know why the small needle  always pointed to the Great Desert.  Park, unwilling to inform him of  the exact truth, replied that his mother lived far beyond the sands of  the Sahara, and that while she was alive the piece of iron would always  point that way and serve as a guide to conduct him to her.  Ali,  suspecting that there was something magical in it, was afraid of keeping  so dangerous an instrument in his possession.    The Moors now held a council to determine what should be done with the  stranger.  Some proposed that he should be put to death, others that he  should only lose his right-hand, and one of Ali's sons came to him in  the evening and with much concern informed him that his uncle had  persuaded his father to put out his eyes.  Ali, however, replied that he  would not do so until Fatima, the queen, who was at present in the  north, had seen him.    In vain Park begged that he might be permitted to return to Jarra.  Ali  replied that he must wait till Fatima had seen him, and that then he  should be at liberty to go, and that his horse should be restored to  him.    So wearied out was he at last with all the insults he received that he  felt ready to commit any act of desperation.    One day Ali sent to say that he must be in readiness to ride out with  him, as he intended to show him to some of his women.  They together  visited the tents of four different ladies, at every one of which he was  presented with a bowl of milk and water.  They were all remarkably  corpulent, which in that country is the highest mark of beauty.  They  were also very inquisitive, examining minutely his hair and skin, though  affecting to consider him as a sort of inferior being to themselves, and  pretending to shudder when they looked at the whiteness of his skin.  Notwithstanding the attention shown him by these fat dames, his  condition was not improved, and he was often left without even food or  water, while suffering fearfully from the heat.    Ali at length moved his camp, and Park was sent forward under the escort  of one of the king's sons.  The new encampment was larger than that of  Benowm, and situated in the midst of a thick wood, about two miles  distant from a neighbouring town, called Bubaka.  Here Park was  introduced to queen Fatima by Ali.  She seemed much pleased at his  coming, shaking hands with him, even though Ali had told her that he was  a Christian.  She was a remarkably corpulent woman, with an Arab cast of  countenance and long hair.    After asking a number of questions, with the answers to which she  appeared interested, she became perfectly at her ease and presented her  visitor with a bowl of milk.  She was, indeed, the only person who  treated Park kindly during his stay.    Both men and cattle suffered much from thirst, and though Ali had given  him a skin for containing water, and Fatima once or twice presented him  with a small supply, yet such was the barbarous disposition of the  Moors, that when his boy attempted to fill his skin at the wells, he  generally received a sound drubbing for his presumption.  One night,  having in vain attempted to obtain water, he resolved to try his fortune  himself at the wells, which were about half a mile distant.  About  midnight he set out, and, guided by the lowing of the cattle, he reached  the place.  Here a number of Moors were drawing water, but he was driven  by them from each well in succession.  At last he reached one where  there was only an old man and two boys.  He earnestly besought the first  to give him some water.  The old man complied, and drew up a bucket; but  no sooner did Park take hold of it than, recollecting that the stranger  was a Christian, and fearing that his bucket might be polluted, he  dashed the water into the trough, and told him to drink from thence.  Though the trough was none of the largest, and three cows were already  drinking in it, Park knelt down, and, thrusting his head between two of  the cows, drank with intense pleasure till the water was nearly  exhausted.    The rainy season was now approaching, when the Moors evacuate the  country of the negroes and return to the skirts of the Great Desert.    Ali looked upon Park as a lawful prisoner, and though Fatima allowed him  food and otherwise treated him kindly, she had as yet said nothing about  his release.    Fortunately for him, Ali had resolved to send an expedition to Jarra, of  two hundred Moorish horsemen, to attack Daisy.  Park obtained permission  to accompany them, and, through the influence of Fatima, he also  received back his bundle of clothes and his horse.    On the 26th of May, accompanied by Johnson and his boy Demba, he set out  with a number of Moors on horseback, Ali having gone on before.  On his  way Ali's chief slave came up and told Demba that Ali was to be his  master in future; then, turning to Park, said, \"The boy goes back to  Bubaka, but you may take the old fool,\" meaning Johnson, \"with you to  Jarra.\"  Park in vain pleaded for Demba, but the slave only answered  that if he did not mount his horse he would send him back likewise.  Poor Demba was not less affected than his master.  Having shaken hands  with the unfortunate boy, and assured him that he would do everything in  his power to redeem him, Park saw him led off by three of Ali's slaves.    At Jarra he took up his lodgings in the house of an old acquaintance,  Dayman, whom he requested to use his influence with Ali to redeem the  boy, and promised him a bill on Dr Laidley for the value of two slaves  the moment he brought him to Jarra.    Ali, however, considering the boy to be Park's principal interpreter,  would not liberate him, fearing that he would be instrumental in  conducting him to Bambarra.    Still Park was eager, if possible, to continue his journey, but Johnson  refused to proceed further.  At the same time he foresaw that he must  soon fall a victim to the Moors if he remained where he was, and that if  he went forward singly he must encounter great difficulties, both from  the want of an interpreter and the means of purchasing food.  On the  other hand he was very unwilling to return to England without  accomplishing his mission.  He therefore determined to escape on the  first opportunity at all risks.  This arrived sooner than he expected.    On the 26th of June news was brought that Daisy had taken Simbug, and  would be at Jarra the next day.  Hearing this, the people began packing  up their property and beating corn for their journey, and early in the  morning nearly half had set off--the women and children crying, the men  looking sullen and dejected.    Though Park was sure of being well treated could he make himself known  to Daisy, yet as he might be mistaken for a Moor in the confusion, he  thought it wisest to mount his horse with a large bag of corn before  him, and to ride away with the rest of the townspeople.    He again fell in with his friend Dayman and Johnson.  They pushed on two  days' journey to the town of Queira.    While Park was out tending his horse in the fields on the 1st of July,  Ali's chief slave and four Moors arrived at Queira, and Johnson, who  suspected the object of their visit, sent two boys to overhear their  conversation.  From them he learned that the Moors had come to convey  Park back to Bubaka.  This was a terrible stroke to him, and, now  convinced that Ali intended to detain him for ever in captivity, or  perhaps to take his life, he determined at all risks to attempt making  his escape.  He communicated his design to Johnson, who, though he  approved of it, showed no inclination to accompany him.  Park therefore  resolved to proceed by himself, and to trust to his own resources.        CHAPTER THREE.    MUNGO PARK'S TRAVELS CONTINUED.
