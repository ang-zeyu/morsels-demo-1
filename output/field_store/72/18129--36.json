The post-primary  departments of district high schools are eligible for all services,  including exchanges.    The information and request service, available to all schools which have  joined the service, supplies to both children and teachers, on  short-term loan, books and other material to meet individual needs not  satisfied by the general exchanges. The particular aim is to meet  requests for children's books and books for school purposes. Schools  have been urged to make the fullest use of this service which helps to  ensure that the right book reaches the child who needs it, for classroom  activity or any other worth-while purpose. Material for the personal or  study needs of teachers cannot usually be supplied by the School Library  Service; such requests can, however, be handed to the nearest public  library or \"B\" library group linked with the Country Library Service.  When schools are establishing new libraries extra help by way of special  collections or indefinite loans is given. All public libraries and  groups receiving library service from the Country Library Service may  use the information and request service. During the year 328,482 books  were sent out in response to requests.    The preparation of book lists, which have proved of value to schools and  public libraries has been continued this year. The supplements to  _Junior Fiction_ and _Non-Fiction for Primary Schools_ are annotated  lists of the better, recently published children's books, other than  those appearing in countries with which there are currency difficulties;  these supplements are distributed twice a year to schools and public  libraries which ask to be placed on a mailing list. \"For the  Post-primary Library\", a series of annotated lists of current titles,  has been appearing regularly in the _Education Gazette_ since 16 July  1951. Public libraries and larger post-primary schools will find further  suggestions in the cyclostyled series \"Books for Young Adults\" which  appears at intervals; it includes books for recreational reading and  gives special consideration to suitable adult titles. Other lists are  prepared for publication as the need arises. A bibliography of material  published by the Service from its inception in 1942 appeared in the  annual report for the year ended 31 March 1956. Since that date the  following items have been added:         Books for young adults: List 5, October 1956; List 6, June 1957;       List 7, November 1957.         Books for young people, 1957.         Interim list of subject headings for New Zealand school libraries,       o.p.         Junior fiction.         Supplements: April 1956 to September 1956; October 1956 to March       1957; April 1957 to September 1957.         Non-fiction for primary schools. (Supplements have title, _Junior       Non-fiction_.)         Supplements: April 1956 to September 1956; October 1956 to March       1957; April 1957 to September 1957.         Quick-reference books for high-school libraries, 1956.         Sets of books for French classes, August 1956.    In addition to this published material, buying and reading lists are  constantly being prepared to meet the special needs of individual  schools, public libraries, and groups concerned with the reading of  children and adolescents.    Assistance is given to schools planning new libraries or reorganising  existing libraries. The visiting of schools to give help where needed  and to discuss the use of books is still limited by staff shortages.    Except for small parcels which are sent by post, books are distributed  in hampers or cartons by rail or road transport from 15 centres--North  Island: Whangarei and Hastings public libraries; offices of the Country  Library Service in Hamilton and Palmerston North and of the School  Library Service in Auckland, Napier, New Plymouth, Wanganui, and  Wellington. South Island: Greymouth, Timaru, Dunedin, and Invercargill  public libraries; the office of the Country Library Service in  Christchurch and of the School Library Service in Nelson. Schools are  usually served by the nearest School Library Service office.    The headquarters office at Wellington is responsible for the  coordination of the service, for the selection, ordering, classifying,  and cataloguing of new books and their dispatch to district offices, the  maintenance of a comprehensive collection of children's and young  people's books used to meet requests which cannot be supplied from local  offices, and the distribution of books to schools and public libraries  in or near Wellington city and the Hutt Valley. To enable children at  smaller country schools to see and to choose for themselves from a wide  range of books, the possibilities of service by book van are being  considered.    Since its establishment schools joining the service have paid a  subscription at the rate of 1s. per pupil (Standard 1 and upwards) for  each of the first two years. Ministerial authority was given during the  year to discontinue this levy.    Schools borrowing books are asked to accept responsibility for (a)  safe-keeping of books while on loan to the school, including books  issued to members of staff for school use; (b) return of books when due;  (c) payment for books lost or damaged beyond fair wear and tear; (d)  payment of freight and postal charges from school to School Library  Service office.    Books are made available to special institutions controlled by the  Education Department. Primary pupils of the Correspondence School are  provided with individual postal service from district offices. Child  welfare institutions, training centres, health camps, and other special  groups are given service according to their needs. Teachers' training  colleges, young people's groups, kindergartens, and nursery play centre  supervisors are also helped. Visits to School Library Service offices by  teachers in training are arranged wherever possible.    Assistance to several Pacific Island schools has been continued from the  Auckland office by means of extended loans. Under this system the  schools receive an original bulk loan which they check annually,  reporting losses and returning damaged and worn books for replacement,  wherever possible, by new titles, so that loans will not degenerate into  collections of old books. The schools concerned were listed in last  year's annual report. The desirability of extension of this service is  constantly in review.    During the year members of the staff acted as librarians at the usual  teachers' refresher courses. Appropriate collections of books always  create considerable interest. Discussions at these courses have been  helpful in the selection of books and have brought about an increased  awareness of the uses of books in a wide range of schools.    Below are tables showing details of the School Library Service as at 31  March 1958. The figures for the number of \"schools\" and \"pupils\" include  those for primary schools and post-primary departments of district high  schools but do not include those for other post-primary schools as these  do not receive general exchanges of books.

One thousand four hundred and sixty-nine new titles  were added during the year.          SECTION III--LIBRARY SCHOOL      1957 PROFESSIONAL COURSE    At the end of November nine diplomas and five certificates were awarded  to 14 students who completed the course. For health reasons one student  accepted under the Colombo Plan returned to his own country at the end  of the first term. Of the successful students two returned to the  libraries in which they had been employed before attending the school,  three were appointed librarians of smaller public libraries, four joined  the staffs of city public libraries, two are now members of the School  Library Service staff, and one the librarian of the Central Military  District. The two holders of UNESCO Fellowships are consolidating their  training by carrying out practical work in the Delhi Public Library for  three months.    1958 PROFESSIONAL COURSE    This course began on 4 March with 17 New Zealand students and the three  Indonesian students who have been working in libraries in New Zealand  since February 1957.    Four students have a master's and nine a bachelor's degree in arts, one  a bachelor's degree "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1980"],[0,"Stories (#4)"],[1,"my chance of fever. I had become so tough  from continual knocking about that I did not set it down at much. Well,  I got on all right for a while. It is a wonderfully beautiful piece of  bush veldt, with great ranges of mountains running through it, and round  granite koppies starting up here and there, looking out like sentinels  over the rolling waste of bush. But it is very hot,--hot as a  stew-pan,--and when I was there that March, which, of course, is autumn  in this part of Africa, the whole place reeked of fever. Every morning,  as I trekked along down by the Oliphant River, I used to creep from the  waggon at dawn and look out. But there was no river to be seen--only a  long line of billows of what looked like the finest cotton-wool tossed  up lightly with a pitchfork. It was the fever mist. Out from among the  scrub, too, came little spirals of vapour, as though there were hundreds  of tiny fires alight in it--reek rising from thousands of tons of  rotting vegetation. It was a beautiful place, but the beauty was the  beauty of death; and all those lines and blots of vapour wrote one great  word across the surface of the country, and that word was 'fever.'    \"It was a dreadful year of illness that. I came, I remember, to one  little kraal of knobnoses, and went up to it to see if I could get some  _maas_ (curdled butter-milk) and a few mealies. As I got near I was  struck with the silence of the place. No children began to chatter, and  no dogs barked. Nor could I see any native sheep or cattle. The place,  though it had evidently been recently inhabited, was as still as the  bush round it, and some guinea-fowl got up out of the prickly pear  bushes right at the kraal gate. I remember that I hesitated a little  before going in, there was such an air of desolation about the spot.  Nature never looks desolate when man has not yet laid his hand upon her  breast; she is only lovely. But when man has been, and has passed away,  then she looks desolate.    \"Well, I passed into the kraal, and went up to the principal hut. In  front of the hut was something with an old sheepskin _kaross_ (rug)  thrown over it. I stooped down and drew off the rug, and then shrank  back amazed, for under it was the body of a young woman recently dead.  For a moment I thought of turning back, but my curiosity overcame me; so  going past the dead woman, I went down on my hands and knees and crept  into the hut. It was so dark that I could not see anything, though  I could smell a great deal, so I lit a match. It was a 'tandstickor'  match, and burnt slowly and dimly, and as the light gradually increased  I made out what I took to be a family of people, men, women, and  children, fast asleep. Presently it burnt up brightly, and I saw that  they too, five of them altogether, were quite dead. One was a baby. I  dropped the match in a hurry, and was making my way out of the hut as  hard as I could go, when I caught sight of two bright eyes staring  out of a corner. Thinking it was a wild cat, or some such animal, I  redoubled my haste, when suddenly a voice near the eyes began first to  mutter, and then to send up a succession of awful yells. Hastily I lit  another match, and perceived that the eyes belonged to an old woman,  wrapped up in a greasy leather garment. Taking her by the arm, I dragged  her out, for she could not, or would not, come by herself, and the  stench was overpowering me. Such a sight as she was--a bag of bones,  covered over with black, shrivelled parchment. The only white thing  about her was her wool, and she seemed to be pretty well dead except for  her eyes and her voice. She thought that I was a devil come to take her,  and that is why she yelled so. Well, I got her down to the waggon,  and gave her a 'tot' of Cape smoke, and then, as soon as it was ready,  poured about a pint of beef-tea down her throat, made from the flesh  of a blue vilder-beeste I had killed the day before, and after that she  brightened up wonderfully. She could talk Zulu,--indeed, it turned out  that she had run away from Zululand in T'Chaka's time,--and she told  me that all the people whom I had seen had died of fever. When they had  died the other inhabitants of the kraal had taken the cattle and  gone away, leaving the poor old woman, who was helpless from age and  infirmity, to perish of starvation or disease, as the case might be. She  had been sitting there for three days among the bodies when I found her.  I took her on to the next kraal, and gave the headman a blanket to look  after her, promising him another if I found her well when I came back. I  remember that he was much astonished at my parting with two blankets for  the sake of such a worthless old creature. 'Why did I not leave her in  the bush?' he asked. Those people carry the doctrine of the survival of  the fittest to its extreme, you see.    \"It was the night after I had got rid of the old woman that I made my  first acquaintance with my friend yonder,\" and he nodded toward the  skull that seemed to be grinning down at us in the shadow of the wide  mantel-shelf. \"I had trekked from dawn till eleven o'clock,--a long  trek,--but I wanted to get on; and then had turned the oxen out to  graze, sending the voorlooper to look after them, meaning to inspan  again about six o'clock, and trek with the moon till ten. Then I got  into the waggon and had a good sleep till half-past two or so in the  afternoon, when I rose and cooked some meat, and had my dinner, washing  it down with a pannikin of black coffee; for it was difficult to get  preserved milk in those days. Just as I had finished, and the driver, a  man called Tom, was washing up the things, in comes the young scoundrel  of a voorlooper driving one ox before him.    \"'Where are the other oxen?' I asked.    \"'Koos!' he said, 'Koos! (chief) the other oxen have gone away. I turned  my back for a minute, and when I looked round again they were all gone  except Kaptein, here, who was rubbing his back against a tree.'    \"'You mean that you have been asleep, and let them stray, you villain. I  will rub your back against a stick,' I answered, feeling very angry, for  it was not a pleasant prospect to be stuck up in that fever-trap for a  week or so while we were hunting for the oxen. 'Off you go, and you too,  Tom, and mind you don't come back till you have found them. They have  trekked back along the Middelburg Road, and are a dozen miles off by  now, I'll be bound. Now, no words; go, both of you.'    \"Tom, the driver, swore and caught the lad a hearty kick, which he  richly deserved, and then, having tied old Kaptein up to the disselboom  with a riem, they took their assegais and sticks, and started. I would  have gone too, only I knew that somebody must look after the waggon, and  I did not like to leave either of the boys with it at night. I was in a  very bad temper, indeed, although I was pretty well used to these sort  of occurrences, and soothed myself by taking a rifle and going to kill  something. For a couple of hours I poked about without seeing anything  that I could get a shot at, but at last, just as I was again within  seventy yards of the waggon, I put up an old Impala ram from behind a  mimosa-thorn. He ran straight for the waggon, and it was not till he was  passing within a few feet of it that I could get a decent shot at him.  Then I pulled, and caught him half-way down the spine; over he went,  dead as a door-nail, and a pretty shot it was, though I ought not to say  it. This little incident put me into rather a better temper, especially  as the buck had rolled right against the after part of the waggon, so I  had only to gut him, fix a riem round his legs, and haul him up. By the  time I had done this the sun was down, and the full moon was up, and  a beautiful moon it was. And then there came that wonderful hush which  sometimes falls over the African bush in the early hours of the night.  No beast was moving, and no bird called. Not a breath of air stirred the  quiet trees, and the shadows did not even quiver, they only grew. It was  very oppressive and very lonely, for there was not a sign of the cattle  or the boys. I was quite thankful for the society of old Kaptein, who  was lying down contentedly against the disselboom, chewing the cud with  a good conscience.    \"Presently, however, Kaptein began to get restless. First he snorted,  then he got up and snorted again. I could not make it out, so like a  fool I got down off the waggon-box to have a look round, thinking it  might be the lost oxen coming.    \"Next instant I regretted it, for all of a sudden I heard a roar and saw  something yellow flash past me and light on poor Kaptein. Then came  a bellow of agony from the ox, and a crunch as the lion put his teeth  through the poor brute's neck, and I began to understand what had  happened. My rifle was in the waggon, and my first thought was to get  hold of it, and I turned and made a bolt for it. I got my foot on the  wheel and flung my body forward on to the waggon, and there I stopped as  if I were frozen, and no wonder, for as I was about to spring up I heard  the lion behind me, and next second I felt the brute, ay, as plainly as  I can feel this table. I felt him, I say, sniffing at my left leg that  was hanging down.    \"My word! I did feel queer; I don't think that I ever felt so queer  before. I dared not move for the life of me, and the odd thing was that  I seemed to lose power over my leg, which developed an insane sort  of inclination to kick out of its own mere motion--just as hysterical  people want to laugh when they ought to be particularly solemn. Well,  the lion sniffed and sniffed, beginning at my ankle and slowly nosing  away up to my thigh. I thought that he was going to get hold then, but  he did not. He only growled softly, and went back to the ox. Shifting my  head a little I got a full view of him. He was about the biggest lion  I ever saw,--and I have seen a "]]]
