The distance may be measured, and its exactness  tested, by pricking a small hole from each side of the wood with the  marking gauge and carefully noting that the pricked holes coincide. The  gauge mark is clearly shown in the various illustrations. Now, take a  pencil and scribble or mark \"waste\" on the parts you intend to cut away.  This will save trouble later on, especially if you are making several  joints at once. Take your sharp penknife or marking knife blade, and cut  fairly deeply into the marked line on the portion you are going to pare  away.    [Illustration: Fig. 66.--Chiselling away Wood up to Gauge Line.]    [Illustration: Fig. 67.--How work is held when Sawing Shoulder.]    Fix the wood firmly in your vice, or against your cutting board or bench  stop, as may be more convenient to you, and with a sharp chisel cut away  the wood up to the marked line, as at Fig. 66. The channel in the sketch  is exaggerated, so as to show the method clearly. The object of using a  penknife or marking knife to mark your work, instead of using a pencil,  will be obvious. Owing to the knife having scored about 1/16 in. deep  across the fibres of the wood, the timber will come away cleanly when the  chisel is used, as at Fig. 66. The small channel thus made will form a  guide in which to start your tenon or dovetail saw; it prevents the saw  cutting on the wrong side of the marked line and thus making the halving  too wide.    [Illustration: Fig. 68.--Paring away Waste with Chisel.]    [Illustration: Fig. 69.--Showing an Oblique Halved Joint.]    SAWING.--Lay the work on the cutting board as at Fig. 67; or, if you  prefer, put the work in the vice. Carefully saw down the work until you  _just touch_ the gauge line. Do not press heavily with the saw; use it  lightly; the weight of the back iron which is fixed on the saw will  ensure the saw feeding into the work quite fast enough. If the saw is  newly sharpened it will, in fact, be an advantage to slightly ease the  weight of the saw from off the wood, owing to the keenness of its edge.  If the halving is a very wide one, additional cuts may be sawn between  the outside marks, and these will greatly facilitate the removal of the  waste wood when paring it away. For sawing the joint reference may be  made to the chapter on Dovetailing.    [Illustration: Fig. 70.--Sawing the Cheek of a Halving Joint.]    PARING away the waste material with a chisel is the next step, and this  is shown at Fig. 68. The work may be chiselled either in a vertical or a  horizontal position. The horizontal position is the easiest for the  amateur who has a vice or handscrew, because he may hold the work  securely with a mechanical device and so avoid the unnecessary risk to  his fingers.    Take the chisel and cut away A, Fig. 68; now turn the chisel and cut  away B; after which keep the chisel horizontal and cut off \"the top of  the hill,\" as it were, C. Repeat the three operations until you gradually  pare the wood away exactly to the gauge line. When chiselling, if you  find a tendency for the work to chip or crumble at the back edge owing to  the forward pressure of the chisel, turn your wood round and begin to cut  from the other edge, allowing the chisel to finish paring at the centre.    JOINTS OTHER THAN A RIGHT ANGLE.--If the halving joint is at an angle  similar to the sketch shown at Fig. 69, great care will have to be  exercised in the use of the chisel, owing to the change in the direction  of the grain of the wood. The arrow marks in this sketch distinctly  indicate the direction in which the chiselling must be done so as to give  a smooth result. This change of direction for cutting also applies to the  bottom of the halving joint.    CUTTING JOINT AT END OF TIMBER (Fig. 70).--Should the halving joint be  used at the end of a piece of wood, as at Fig. 30, the waste material may  be roughly sawn away and the flat surface trimmed up with a chisel.    To saw out this type of halving joint, proceed to work the shoulder line  as already described; then place the piece of wood obliquely in the vice  as shown (Fig. 70) and proceed to saw down the vertical line, carefully  watching the gauge line to see that you saw on the _waste_ side of the  lines. Then turn the piece of timber with its opposite edge towards you,  and again use the saw as illustrated. You will this time only have to  watch the gauge mark on the edge of the wood, because the saw will  readily follow in the saw kerf already made. Now place the wood  vertically in the vice, and keeping the saw in a horizontal position, saw  down to the shoulder line.    Halving joints properly made and fitted should knock together with the  weight of the clenched fist; the use of a heavy mallet or hammer will  deface the work.    [Illustration: Fig. 71.--Joints used in the erection of a Queen Post Roof  Truss.]          THE BRIDLE JOINT      A bridle joint is often defined as the reverse of a mortise and tenon,  and is chiefly used in the carpentry and joinery trades. The name  probably originated from the fact that it bears some resemblance to the  manner in which a bit slips into the horse's mouth and is fastened to the  bridle. There are fewer varieties of the bridle joint than of the halved  or the mortise and tenon; and this being the case we may take the  opportunity of giving a few detailed directions, with explanatory  illustrations, on the setting out and the making.    [Illustration: Fig. 72.--Simple Bridle Joint.]    Fig. 72 shows a bridle joint in what is perhaps its simplest form, the  separate pieces being given at the left and the completed joint at the  right. A joint of this type may be applied in nearly all cases where a  halved or a mortise and tenon joint could be used. Bridle joints have an  advantage as regards appearance over the mortise and tenoned variety in  cases such as Fig. 73, which shows an occasional table leg fitted to the  circular top framing. The bridle joint here allows the grain of the leg  to run through to the top, and gives a better and more workmanlike  appearance to the completed article.    [Illustration: Fig. 73.--Table Leg Bridle-jointed to Rail.]    Fig. 74 is a \"Mitred bridle joint,\" the part _a_ showing the upright  portion separated. This is a most useful joint for positions similar to  that shown in the small glass frame, Fig. 75. The wood framing in this  case is only 1-3/8 in. in width, and if a mortise were used it would have  to be exceptionally small. The shaped rail at the bottom of this frame  again shows the application of the bridle joint.    Fig. 76 shows an \"Oblique bridle joint,\" used in many instances as a  brace, or strut, to prevent framing from racking. (See also Figs. 31 and  32.)    Fig. 77 is a \"Stopped bridle joint,\" used in positions where the top or  bottom edge of the work meets the eye, and where, if the rail were  allowed to run through, the end grain would appear unsightly.    [Illustration: Fig. 74.--Mitre Bridle Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 75.--Mirror Frame with Bridle Joints.]    Fig. 78 is a so-called bridle-joint at the corner of a frame. This is  also called an \"Open slot mortise and tenon joint,\" a good strong,  serviceable joint which can be used instead of the closed mortise and  tenon type, its advantage being that less labour is required in the  making. (See also Fig. 169.)    Fig. 79 is an \"Oblique angle bridle joint,\" used in similar positions to  the above, but when the two pieces meet at an acute angle at the end of a  frame.    Fig. 80 shows the application of the bridle joint to a roof truss. Two  sketches are shown at the joining of the tie beam and the principal  rafter. The joint _a_ is the type generally used. (See also Fig. 71 for  the joints in a queen post roof.)    [Illustration: Fig. 76.--Oblique Bridle Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 77.--Stopped Bridle Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 78.--Bridle Joint at Corner of Frame.]    [Illustration: Fig. 79.--Oblique Angle Bridle Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 80.--Application of Bridle Joint to Roof Truss.]    SETTING OUT AND MARKING.--It is a safe rule, when setting out a bridle  joint, to divide the thickness of the timber into three equal parts. This  will leave the timber on each side of the tongue equal to the thickness  of the tongue, thus giving uniform strength to the joint. The bridle  joint is chiefly used for connecting the internal parts of wooden frames.  It is stronger than the halving joint, and, owing to its peculiar  construction, requires little in the way of pegs, screws or nails to  secure it in position. Fig. 81 illustrates the joint, both open and  closed.    To understand the method of setting out and marking, glance at the  sketch, Fig. 81. It is not necessary that the bridle piece A be the same  width as the cross piece B; but it must be remembered when setting out  the joint with the marking knife or pencil that the width marked W on  piece B must be equal to the width W on the piece A. The timber should be  fairly accurately sawn or planed to the same thickness, and all edges  should be square and true.    The wood is placed upon the bench, and the joint marked out by using a  marking knife or penknife blade and the try square. A knife blade is much  better than a pencil, as the sharp edge severs the fibres of the wood and  gives a finer line than the pencil. It is not always necessary to exactly  square and trim the end of piece A; it may with advantage in many cases  be left at least 1/4 in. longer than necessary and levelled off with the  saw, plane and chisel after the joint is put together. (See Method of  Cutting in Fig. 92, page 47.)    When the piece A has to have a bridle joint fitted at each end, it is  customary to cut the timber about 3/8 in. longer than necessary, and mark  the shoulder lines C to the exact length, after which the joints are cut.  This leaves the ends standing over the horizontal rails, and, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#4)"],[1,"near the outer surface of the plant stems. The pith  and woody tissues are of no value. The flax plant is an annual and to  obtain the best fibers it must be gathered before it is fully ripe. To  obtain seed from which the best quality of linseed oil can be made it is  usually necessary to sacrifice the quality of the fibers to some extent.      [Illustration: FLAX]      [Sidenote: Treatment of Flax]    Unlike cotton, flax is contaminated by impurities from which it must be  freed before it can be woven into cloth. The first process to which the  freshly pulled flax is submitted is that of \"rippling\" or the removal of  the seed capsules. Retting, next in order, is the most important  operation. This is done to remove the substances which bind the bast  fibers to each other and to remove the fiber from the central woody  portion of the stem. This consists of steeping the stalks in water.      [Illustration: A FIELD OF FLAX IN MINNESOTA    The Flax Must Be Pulled Up by the Roots to Give Fibres with Tapered Ends.    (Photograph of C. R. Dodge).]      [Sidenote: Retting]    (1) Cold water retting, either running or stagnant water.  (2) Dew retting.  (3) Warm water retting.      [Illustration: RETTING TANK _A_--Inlet; _B_--Undisturbed Water;  _C_--Bundles of Flax.]      Cold water retting in running water is practiced in Belgium. Retting in  stagnant water is the method usually employed in Ireland and Russia. The  retting in stagnant water is more rapidly done, but there is danger of  over-retting on account of the organic matter retained in the water  which favors fermentation. In this case the fiber is weakened.      [Illustration: RETTING FLAX IN THE RIVER LYS, BELGIUM    From the Government Bulletin, \"Flax for Seed and Fiber.\"]      In dew retting, the flax is spread on the field and exposed to the  action of the weather for several weeks without any previous steeping.  This method of retting is practiced in Germany and Russia. Warm water  retting and chemical retting have met with limited success.    When the retting is complete, the flax is set up in sheaves to dry. The  next operations consist of \"breaking,\" \"scutching,\" and \"hackling\" and  are now done by machinery.    [Illustration: FIBERS OF FLAX]    Breaking removes the woody center from the retted and dried flax by  being passed through a series of fluted rollers. The particles of woody  matter adhering to the fibers are detached by scutching.    [Sidenote: Hackling]    Hackling or combing still further separates the fibers into their finest  filaments--\"line\" and \"tow.\" The \"flax line\" is the long and valuable  fiber; the tow, the short coarse tangled fiber which is spun and used  for weaving coarse linen.      [Illustration: FLAX    A, Unthrashed Straw; B, Retted; C, Cleaned or Scutched; D, Hackled or  Dressed.    (Photograph of C. R. Dodge).]      [Illustration: HACKLING FLAX BY HAND    The \"Tow\" Is Seen at the Left and a Bunch of \"Flax line\" on the Bench.    (Photograph of C. R. Dodge, Special Agent U. S. Department of  Agriculture.)]      [Sidenote: Characteristics of Linen]    When freed from all impurities the chief physical characteristics of  flax are its snowy whiteness, silky luster and great tenacity. The  individual fibers may be from ten to twelve inches in length; they  are much greater in diameter than cotton. It is less pliant and elastic  than cotton and bleaches and dyes less readily. Linen cloth is a better  conductor of heat than cotton and clothing made from it is cooler. When  pure, it is, like cotton, nearly pure cellulose.    [Sidenote: Ramie]    Besides the linen, there is a great number of bast fibers fit for  textile purposes, some superior, some inferior. India alone has over  three hundred plants that are fiber yielding. One-third of these furnish  useful fibers for cordage and fabrics. The next in importance to linen  is ramie or rhea, and China grass. China grass comes from a different  plant but is about the same as ramie. The staple is longer and finer  than linen. The great strength of yarn made from it is due to length of  the staple.    The variety and great value of the ramie fibers has long been  recognized, but difficulties attending the separation and degumming of  the fibers have prevented its employment in the manufactures to any  great extent. The native Chinese split and scrape the plant stems,  steeping them in water. The common retting process used for flax is not  effective on account of the large amount of gummy matter, and although  easy to bleach it is difficult to dye in full bright shades without  injuring the luster of the fibers.    [Sidenote: Jute and Hemp]    Jute and hemp belong to the lower order of bast fibers. The fiber is  large and is unfit for any but the coarsest kind of fabrics. Jute is  mainly cultivated in Bengal. The fiber is separated from the plant by  retting, beating, etc.      [Illustration: JUTE GROWING IN LOUISIANA.    From Culture of Hemp and Jute, Report of U. S. Department of Agriculture.]      [Illustration: DRYING HEMP IN KENTUCKY    From \"Culture of Hemp and Jute.\"]      [Sidenote: Olona]    Olona, the textile fiber of Hawaii, is found to have promising  qualities. This plant resembles ramie and belongs to the nettle family  also, but it is without the troublesome resin of the ramie. The fiber is  fine, light, strong, and durable.    The Philippines are rich in fiber producing plants. The manila hemp is  the most prominent, of which coarse cloth is woven, besides the valuable  cordage. The sisal hemp, pineapple, yucca, and a number of fiber plants  growing in the southern part of the United States are worthy of note.  These fiber industries are conducted in a rude way, the fiber being  cleaned by hand, except the pineapple.      SILK    The silk fiber is the most perfect as well as the most beautiful of all  fibers. It is nearly faultless, fine and continuous, often measuring  from 1000 to 4000 feet long, without a scale, joint, or a blemish,  though not of the same diameter or fineness throughout its entire  length, as it becomes finer as the interior of the cocoon is approached.  Silk differs from all other vegetable or animal fibers by being devoid  of all cellular structure.    [Sidenote: Where Produced]    Southern Europe leads in the silk worm culture--Italy, southern France,  and Turkey, with China and India. Several species of moths, natives of  India, China, and Japan, produce the wild silk. The most important of  the \"wild silks\" are the Tussah. Silk plush and the coarser varieties of  buff colored fabrics are made of this silk. While manufacturers do not  favor the wild silk, the coarse uneven weave and softness make it a  favorite with artists and it is being used for interior decoration as  well as for clothing.    [Sidenote: Silk Worm]    The silk of commerce begins with an egg no bigger than a mustard seed,  out of which comes a diminutive caterpillar, which is kept in a frame  and fed upon mulberry leaves. When the caterpillars are full grown, they  climb upon twigs placed for them and begin to spin or make the cocoon.  The silk comes from two little orifices in the head in the form of a  glutinous gum which hardens into a fine elastic fiber. With a motion of  the head somewhat like the figure eight, the silk worm throws this  thread around the body from head to tail until at last it is entirely  enveloped. The body grows smaller and the thread grows finer until at  last it has spun out most of the substance of the body and the task is  done.    If left to itself, when the time came, the moth would eat its way out of  the cocoon and ruin the fiber. A few of the best cocoons are saved for a  new supply of caterpillars; the remainder are baked at a low heat which  destroys the worm but preserves the silk. This now becomes the cocoon of  commerce.    [Sidenote: Reeling Silk]    Next the cocoons go to the reelers who wind the filaments into the silk  yarn that makes the raw material of our mills. The cocoons are thrown  into warm water mixed with soap in order to dissolve the gum. The outer  or coarser covering is brushed off down to the real silk and the end of  the thread found. Four or five cocoons are wound together, the sticky  fibers clinging to each other as they pass through the various guides  and are wound as a single thread on the reels. The silk is dried and  tied into hanks or skeins. As the thread unwinds from the cocoon, it  becomes smaller, so other threads must be added.      [Illustration: SILK:--CATERPILLAR, COCOON, CHRYSALIS, MOTH]      [Sidenote: Organize and Tram]    At the mill the raw silk goes to the \"throwster\" who twists the silk  threads ready for the loom. These threads are of two kinds--\"organize\"  or warp and \"tram\" or filling. The warp runs the long way of woven  fabric or parallel with the selvage and it must be strong, elastic, and  not easily parted by rubbing. To prepare the warp, two threads of raw  silk are slightly twisted. Twist is always put into yarn of any kind to  increase its strength. These threads are united and twisted together and  this makes a strong thread capable of withstanding any reasonable strain  in the loom and it will not roughen. For the woof or tram which is  carried across the woven cloth on the shuttle, the thread should be as  loose and fluffy as possible. Several threads are put together,  subjected to only a very slight twist--just enough to hold the threads  together so they will lie evenly in the finished fabric.    [Sidenote: Boiling Off]    After the yarn leaves the spinners it is again run off on reels to be  taken to the dye house. First the yarn is boiled off in soapy water to  remove the remaining gum. Now the silk takes on its luster. Before it  was dull like cotton. The silk is now finer and harder and is known as  \"souple.\"    [Sidenote: Loading Silk]    The silk fiber has a remarkable property of absorbing certain metallic  salts, still retaining much of its luster.
