The Kentuckian marked  the upward swing of a quirt lash, saw a smaller shape fling up an arm in a  vain attempt to ward off the blow. Another, the one who cried out, was  belaboring the flogger with empty fists, and the voice was that of a girl!    To slide down the loft ladder was again nearer instinct than planned  action. Shiloh snorted as Drew's boots rapped on the stable floor. The  Kentuckian had no idea of the reason for that fight, but he ran out with  the vague notion that an impartial referee was needed.    \"You there--what's goin' on!\" Sergeant Rennie came to life again in the  snapped demand.    The one who fled the quirt came up against the side of the building almost  shoulder to shoulder with Drew. And he was only a boy, about Callie's age,  his black hair flopping over eyes wide with shock and fright. Drew's hand  moved, and the lantern light glinted plainly on the barrel of the Colt.  For a moment they were all still as if sight of the weapon had frozen  them.    The attacker faced Drew directly. He was young and handsome, if you  discounted a darkening bruise already puffing under one eye, a lip cut and  swelling, a scowl twisting rather heavy brows and making an ugly square of  his mistreated mouth.    \"An' who th' devil are you?\"    His voice was thick and slurred. Drew guessed that he had not only been in  a fight but that he was partly drunk. Yet, as he faced the stranger eye to  eye, the Kentuckian was as wary as he had been when bellying down a  Tennessee ridge crest to scout a Yankee railroad blockhouse. He knew what  he fronted; this was more than a drunken bully--a really dangerous man.    That queer little moment of silence lengthened, shutting the two of them  up--alone. Drew could not really name the emotion he felt. Deliberately he  tried to subdue the sensation as he turned to the girl.    \"What's the matter?\"    At first glance he might have thought her a boy, for she wore hide  breeches and boots, a man's shirt now hanging loosely about her hips. She  jerked her head, and a thick braid flopped from under her wide-brimmed  hat.    \"_Senor, por favor_--please--we have done no wrong. We are the  Trinfans--Teodoro and me. Teodoro, he finds _Senor_ Juanito's purse in the  road, he follows to give it back. He is not a _bandido_--he is not _espia_,  a spy one. We are mustangers. Ask of _Don_ Reese, of _Senor_ Kells. Why,  _Senor_ Juanito, do you say Teodoro spy on you, why you hit him with the  whip?\"    \"Not thief, not spy!\" The boy beside Drew dropped a wealed hand from his  face. \"The man who says Teodoro Trinfan is _ladron_--bad one--him I kill!\"    Drew's left arm swept out across the boy's chest, pinning him back against  the stable.    \"Now, what's your story?\" the Kentuckian asked the man he fronted.    \"An' jus' what's all this smokin' 'bout?\" Kells came out. \"You, Shannon,  what're you doin' here? Been drinkin' again, fightin', too, by th' look of  you.\"    \"_Senor_ Kells.\" The girl caught at the older man's arm. \"_Por favor,  senor_, we are not thieves, not spies. We come after _Senor_ Juanito  because he dropped his purse. Then he see Teodoro coming, he not listen--he  beat on him with quirt. You know, we are honest peoples!\"    \"Now then, Faquita, don't you git so upset, gal!\" She was wailing aloud,  making no effort to wipe away the tears running down her cheeks. \"Johnny,  what kinda game you tryin'? You know these kids are straight; them an'  their ol' man's come to work th' Range for wild ones on Rennie's own  askin'. Takin' a quirt to th' kid, eh?\" Kells' voice slid up the scale.  \"You sure have yourself a snootful tonight! Now you jus' walk yourself  outta here on th' bounce. I'm doin' th' sayin' of what goes on, on my own  property.\"    \"You do a lotta sayin', Kells.\" The scowl was gone; Shannon's battered  mouth was actually smiling. But, Drew decided, he liked the scowl better  than the smile and the tone of the voice accompanying it. \"Some men  oughtta put a hobble on their tongues. Sure, I know these young whelps an'  their pa too. Sniffin' round where they ain't wanted. An' mustangers ain't  above throwin' a sticky loop when they see a hoss worth it. We ain't blind  on th' Range.\" His head swung a little so he was looking at the girl.  \"You'd better hold that in mind, gal. Double R hosses have come up missin'  lately. It's easy to run a few prime head south to do some moonlight  tradin' at th' border. An' we don't take kindly to losin' good stock!\"    The boy lunged against Drew's pinioning arm. \"Now he says we are horse  thieves! Tell that to us before the _Don_ Cazar!\"    Shannon curled the quirt lash about his wrist. \"Don't think I won't, Mex!  He don't like havin' his colt crop whittled down. You--\" Those blue eyes,  brilliant, yet oddly shallow and curtained, met Drew's for the second  time. \"Don't know who you are, stranger, but you had no call to mix in.  I'll be seein' you. Kinda free with a gun, leastwise at showin' it. As  quick to back up your play?\"    \"Try me!\" The words came out of Drew before he thought.    Why had he said that? He had never been one to pick a fight or take up a  challenge. What was there about Shannon that prodded Drew this way? He'd  met the gamecock breed before and had never known the need to bristle at  their crowing. Now he was disturbed that Shannon could prick him so.    Odd, the other had been successfully turned from his purpose here. Yet now  as he swung around and walked away down the alley Drew was left with a  nagging doubt, a feeling that in some way or other Shannon had come off  even in this encounter.... But how and why?    Teodoro spat. His sister tugged at Kells' sleeve. \"It is not true what he  said. Why does he wish to make trouble?\"    \"Lissen, gal, an' you, too, Teodoro--jus' keep clear of Johnny Shannon when  he's on th' prod that way. I've knowed that kid since he didn't have  muscle enough to pull a gun 'less he took both hands to th' job. But he's  not needin' any two hands to unholster now. An' he's drinkin' a lot--mean,  ugly drunk, he is. Somethin' must have riled him good tonight--\"    \"In the cantina there was a soldier from the camp,\" Faquita volunteered.  \"They call names. He and _Senor_ Juanito fight. _Don_ Reese, he put them  both out in the street. _Senor_ Juanito he falls, drops purse. Teodoro  picks it up, and we follow. When we try to give it back _Senor_ Juanito  yell, 'spy,' hit with whip. That is the truth, _por Dios_, the truth!\"    \"Yeah, sounds jus' like Johnny these days. Him with a snootful an'  somebody yellin' Reb and Yank. Some men can't forgit an' don't seem to  want to. Johnny sure takes it hard bein' on th' losin' side--turned him  dirt mean. Now, you kids, you stayin' in town?\"    \"_Si._\" Faquita nodded vigorously. \"With Tia Maria.\"    \"Then you git there an' stay clear of Johnny Shannon, _sabe_? No more  trouble.\"    \"_Si, Senor_ Kells. You, _senor_,\" she spoke to Drew, \"to you we owe a big  debt. Come, Teodoro!\" She caught at her brother and pulled him away.    \"What makes a kid go sour?\" Kells asked of the shadows beyond rather than  of Drew. \"Johnny warn't no real trouble 'fore he skinned off to ride with  Howard. Sure he was always a wild one, but no more'n a lotta kids. An'  he'd answer th' lead rein. 'Course we don't know what happened to him in  Texas after th' big retreat th' Rebs made outta here. Could be he larned a  lot what was no good. Now he sops up whisky when he hits town an' picks  fights, like he didn't git his belly full of that in th' war. You can't  never tell how a kid's gonna turn out.\"    \"Hey! Mister Kirby, you better git in here!\" Callie hailed from the  stable. \"Th' mare ... she's....\"    Drew jammed the Colt under his belt and ran.        The scent of hay, of grain, of horse.... Drew's head rolled on the pillow  improvised from hay and blanket as sun lay hot across his face. He rubbed  the back of his hand over his eyes and then came fully awake to remember  the night before.    It took only a minute to get down the ladder into Shadow's stall where a  broom tail jiggled up and down above absurdly long baby legs and small  rounded haunches. Shadow's small daughter breakfasted. Callie squatted on  his heels near-by watching the process benignly.    \"Ain't she 'bout th' best-favored filly you ever saw?\" he asked. \"How come  all your hosses is grays? Shiloh her pa?\"    Drew shook his head. \"No, her sire's Storm Cloud. But all that line are  grays.\"    \"This Storm Cloud, he's a runnin' hoss?\"    \"About the runnin'est horse in his part of the country, Callie. This filly  ought to pick up her heels some, if she takes after her dam and sire.\"    \"What you namin' her?\"    Up to that moment Drew had not really thought about it. The crisp air  blowing into the stable, carrying something beside the scents of the town,  gave him a suggestion.    \"How about Sage, Callie?\"    The boy thought seriously and then nodded. \"Yeah--Sage. That's gray an'  it's purty, smells good, too.\"    Drew pulled up his shirt, dug into the pocket of the money belt for the  horse papers. \"Got a pencil--or better--pen and ink around here anywhere?\"    \"Mister Kells, he keeps ledgers over in th' tack room. Got some ink an' a  pen there. How come you need that? You ain't makin' out no bill of sale on  her already, are you?\" Callie was shocked.    \"Hardly. Just want to put her down right and proper on the tally sheet.\"    The boy followed to watch Drew make the record on the margin of Shadow's  papers. As the Kentuckian explained, Callie was deeply interested.    \"You mean as how you can tell way back jus' what hosses bred your hosses?  That's sure somethin'! Round here we knows a good hoss, but we ain't  always sure of his pa, not if he's wild stuff.\"    \"Lots of wild horses hereabouts then?\"    \"Sure. Some're jus' mustangs; other's good stuff gone wild--run off by th'  'Paches an' broke loose, or got away from a 'wet hoss' band--\"    \"'Wet horse' band?\"    Callie"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20842"],[0,"Dreams (#4)"],[1,"up other  memories which, presenting themselves often with the same deformations  and the same incoherences as the preceding, demand in their turn a new  explanation, and so on indefinitely. But I do not insist upon this point  for the moment. It is sufficient for me to say, in order to answer the  question which I have propounded, that the formative power of the  materials furnished to the dream by the different senses, the power  which converts into precise, determined objects the vague and indistinct  sensations that the dreamer receives from his eyes, his ears, and the  whole surface and interior of his body, is the memory.    Memory! In a waking state we have indeed memories which appear and  disappear, occupying our mind in turn. But they are always memories  which are closely connected with our present situation, our present  occupation, our present action. I recall at this moment the book of M.  d'Hervey on dreams; that is because I am discussing the subject of  dreams and this act orients in a certain particular direction the  activity of my memory. The memories that we evoke while waking, however  distant they may at first appear to be from the present action, are  always connected with it in some way. What is the role of memory in an  animal? It is to recall to him, in any circumstance, the advantageous or  injurious consequences which have formerly arisen in analogous  circumstances, in order to instruct him as to what he ought to do. In  man memory is doubtless less the slave of action, but still it sticks to  it. Our memories, at any given moment, form a solid whole, a pyramid, so  to speak, whose point is inserted precisely into our present action. But  behind the memories which are concerned in our occupations and are  revealed by means of it, there are others, thousands of others, stored  below the scene illuminated by consciousness. Yes, I believe indeed that  all our past life is there, preserved even to the most infinitesimal  details, and that we forget nothing, and that all that we have felt,  perceived, thought, willed, from the first awakening of our  consciousness, survives indestructibly. But the memories which are  preserved in these obscure depths are there in the state of invisible  phantoms. They aspire, perhaps, to the light, but they do not even try  to rise to it; they know that it is impossible and that I, as a living  and acting being, have something else to do than to occupy myself with  them. But suppose that, at a given moment, I become _disinterested_ in  the present situation, in the present action--in short, in all which  previously has fixed and guided my memory; suppose, in other words, that  I am asleep. Then these memories, perceiving that I have taken away the  obstacle, have raised the trapdoor which has kept them beneath the floor  of consciousness, arise from the depths; they rise, they move, they  perform in the night of unconsciousness a great dance macabre. They rush  together to the door which has been left ajar. They all want to get  through. But they cannot; there are too many of them. From the  multitudes which are called, which will be chosen? It is not hard to  say. Formerly, when I was awake, the memories which forced their way  were those which could involve claims of relationship with the present  situation, with what I saw and heard around me. Now it is more vague  images which occupy my sight, more indecisive sounds which affect my  ear, more indistinct touches which are distributed over the surface of  my body, but there are also the more numerous sensations which arise  from the deepest parts of the organism. So, then, among the phantom  memories which aspire to fill themselves with color, with sonority, in  short with materiality, the only ones that succeed are those which can  assimilate themselves with the color-dust that we perceive, the external  and internal sensations that we catch, etc., and which, besides, respond  to the affective tone of our general sensibility.[1] When this union is  effected between the memory and the sensation, we have a dream.    In a poetic page of the Enneades, the philosopher Plotinus, interpreter  and continuator of Plato, explains to us how men come to life. Nature,  he says, sketches the living bodies, but sketches them only. Left to her  own forces she can never complete the task. On the other hand, souls  inhabit the world of Ideas. Incapable in themselves of acting, not even  thinking of action, they float beyond space and beyond time. But, among  all the bodies, there are some which specially respond by their form to  the aspirations of some particular souls; and among these souls there  are those which recognize themselves in some particular body. The body,  which does not come altogether viable from the hand of nature, rises  toward the soul which might give it complete life; and the soul, looking  upon the body and believing that it perceives its own image as in a  mirror, and attracted, fascinated by the image, lets itself fall. It  falls, and this fall is life. I may compare to these detached souls the  memories plunged in the obscurity of the unconscious. On the other hand,  our nocturnal sensations resemble these incomplete bodies. The  sensation is warm, colored, vibrant and almost living, but vague. The  memory is complete, but airy and lifeless. The sensation wishes to find  a form on which to mold the vagueness of its contours. The memory would  obtain matter to fill it, to ballast it, in short to realize it. They  are drawn toward each other; and the phantom memory, incarnated in the  sensation which brings to it flesh and blood, becomes a being with a  life of its own, a dream.    The birth of a dream is then no mystery. It resembles the birth of all  our perceptions. The mechanism of the dream is the same, in general, as  that of normal perception. When we perceive a real object, what we  actually see--the sensible matter of our perception--is very little in  comparison with what our memory adds to it. When you read a book, when  you look through your newspaper, do you suppose that all the printed  letters really come into your consciousness? In that case the whole day  would hardly be long enough for you to read a paper. The truth is that  you see in each word and even in each member of a phrase only some  letters or even some characteristic marks, just enough to permit you to  divine the rest. All of the rest, that you think you see, you really  give yourself as an hallucination. There are numerous and decisive  experiments which leave no doubt on this point. I will cite only those  of Goldscheider and Mueller. These experimenters wrote or printed some  formulas in common use, \"Positively no admission;\" \"Preface to the  fourth edition,\" etc. But they took care to write the words incorrectly,  changing and, above all, omitting letters. These sentences were exposed  in a darkened room. The person who served as the subject of the  experiment was placed before them and did not know, of course, what had  been written. Then the inscription was illuminated by the electric light  for a very short time, too short for the observer to be able to perceive  really all the letters. They began by determining experimentally the  time necessary for seeing one letter of the alphabet. It was then easy  to arrange it so that the observer could not perceive more than eight or  ten letters, for example, of the thirty or forty letters composing the  formula. Usually, however, he read the entire phrase without difficulty.  But that is not for us the most instructive point of this experiment.    If the observer is asked what are the letters that he is sure of having  seen, these may be, of course, the letters really written, but there may  be also absent letters, either letters that we replaced by others or  that have simply been omitted. Thus an observer will see quite  distinctly in full light a letter which does not exist, if this letter,  on account of the general sense, ought to enter into the phrase. The  characters which have really affected the eye have been utilized only to  serve as an indication to the unconscious memory of the observer. This  memory, discovering the appropriate remembrance, _i.e._, finding the  formula to which these characters give a start toward realization,  projects the remembrance externally in an hallucinatory form. It is  this remembrance, and not the words themselves, that the observer has  seen. It is thus demonstrated that rapid reading is in great part a work  of divination, but not of abstract divination. It is an externalization  of memories which take advantage, to a certain extent, of the partial  realization that they find here and there in order to completely realize  themselves.    Thus, in the waking state and in the knowledge that we get of the real  objects which surround us, an operation is continually going on which is  of quite the same nature as that of the dream. We perceive merely a  sketch of the object. This sketch appeals to the complete memory, and  this complete memory, which by itself was either unconscious or simply  in the thought state, profits by the occasion to come out. It is this  kind of hallucination, inserted and fitted into a real frame, that we  perceive. It is a shorter process: it is very much quicker done than to  see the thing itself. Besides, there are many interesting observations  to be made upon the conduct and attitude of the memory images during  this operation. It is not necessary to suppose that they are in our  memory in a state of inert impressions. They are like the steam in a  boiler, under more or less tension.    At the moment when the perceived sketch calls them forth, it is as if  they were then grouped in families according to their relationship and  resemblances. There are experiments of Muensterberg, earlier than those  of Goldscheider and Mueller, which appear to me to confirm this  hypothesis, although they"]]]
