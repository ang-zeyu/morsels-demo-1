(M15)    In the meantime, the country had been invaded by a fresh enemy, and the  same atrocities which the Briton had suffered at the hands of the Saxon,  the Saxon was made to suffer at the hands of the Dane. London suffered  with the rest of the kingdom. In 839 we read of a \"great slaughter\"  there;(22) in 851 the city was in the hands of the enemy, and continued to  remain at the mercy of the Danes, so much so, in fact, that in 872 we find  the Danish army taking up winter quarters within its walls, as in a city  that was their own.(23)    (M16)    It was now, when the clouds were darkest, that Alfred, brother of King  Ethelred, appeared on the scene, and after more than one signal success by  land and sea, concluded the treaty of Wedmore (A.D. 878)(24) by which a  vast tract of land bounded by an imaginary line drawn from the Thames  along the river Lea to Bedford, and thence along the Roman Watling Street  to the Welsh border, was ceded to the enemy under the name of _Danelagh_.  The treaty, although it curtailed the Kingdom of Wessex, and left London  itself at the mercy of the Danes, was followed by a period of comparative  tranquillity, which allowed Alfred time to make preparations for a fresh  struggle that was to wrest from the enemy the land they had won.    (M17)    The Danes, like the Angles and the Jutes before them, set little store by  fortifications and walled towns, preferring always to defend themselves by  combat in open field, and the Roman wall of the City was allowed to fall  still further into decay. In the eyes of Alfred on the other hand, London,  with its surrounding wall, was a place of the first importance, and one to  be acquired and kept at all hazards. At length he achieved the object of  his ambition and succeeded in driving out the Danes, (A.D. 883 or  884).(25)    (M18)    Whilst the enemy directed their attention to further conquests in France  and Belgium, Alfred bent his energies towards repairing the City walls and  building a citadel for his defence--\"the germ of that tower which was to be  first the dwelling place of Kings, and then the scene of the martyrdom of  their victims.\"(26) To his foresight in this respect was it due that the  city of London was never again taken by open assault, but successfully  repelled all attacks whilst the surrounding country was often devastated.    Nor did Alfred confine his attention solely to strengthening the city  against attacks of enemies without or to making it more habitable. He also  laid the foundation of an internal Government analagous to that  established in the Shires. Under the year A.D. 886, the Anglo-Saxon  Chronicle(27) records that \"King AElfred restored London; and all the Anglo  race turned to him that were not in bondage of the Danish men; and he then  committed the burgh to \"the keeping of the aldorman AEthelred.\" In course  of time the analogy between shire and city organization became more close.  Where the former had its Shiremote, the latter had its Folkmote, meeting  in St. Paul's Churchyard by summons of the great bell. The County Court  found its co-relative in the Husting Court of the City; the Hundred Court  in the City Wardmote.(28)    (M19)    For the next ten years Alfred busied himself founding a navy and  establishing order in different parts of the country, but in 896 he was  compelled to hasten to London from the west of England to assist in the  repulse of another attack of the Danes. Two years before (894) the Danes  had threatened London, having established a fortification at Beamfleate or  South Benfleet, in Essex, whence they harried the surrounding country. The  Londoners on that occasion joined that part of the army which Alfred had  left behind in an attack upon the fort, which they not only succeeded in  taking, but they \"took all that there was within, as well money as women  and children, and brought all to London; and all the ships they either  broke in pieces or burned, or brought to London or to Rochester.\"(29) Nor  was this all: Hasting's wife and his two sons had been made prisoners, but  were chivalrously restored by Alfred.    (M20)    The Danes, however, were not to be daunted by defeat nor moved from their  purpose by the generous conduct of Alfred. In 896 they again appeared.  This time they erected a work on the sea, twenty miles above London.  Alfred made a reconnaissance and closed up the river so that they found it  impossible to bring out their ships.(30) They therefore abandoned their  vessels and escaped across country, and \"the men of London\" writes the  chronicler, \"brought away the ships, and all those which they could not  bring off they broke up, and those that were _stalworth_ they brought into  London.\"(31)    (M21)    The principle of each man becoming responsible to the Government for the  good behaviour of the neighbour, involved in the system of frankpledge  which Alfred established throughout the whole of his kingdom, subject to  his rule, was carried a step further by the citizens of London at a later  date. Under Athelstan (A.D. 925-940) we find them banding together and  forming an association for mutual defence of life and property, and thus  assisting the executive in the maintenance of law and order. A complete  code of ordinances, regulating this \"frith\" or peace gild, as it was  called, drawn up by the bishops and reeves of the burgh, and confirmed by  the members on oath, is still preserved to us.(32)    (M22)    The enactments are chiefly directed against thieves, the measures to be  taken to bring them to justice, and the penalties to be imposed on them,  the formation of a common fund for the pursuit of thieves, and for making  good to members any loss they may have sustained. So far, the gild  undertook duties of a public character, such as are found incorporated  among other laws of the kingdom, but it had, incidentally, also its social  and religious side. When the ruling members met in their gild-hall,(33)  which they did once a month, \"if they could and had leisure,\" they enjoyed  a refection with ale-drinking or \"byt-filling.\"    (M23)    Some writers see in the \"frith-gild\" of Athelstan's day, nothing more than  a mere \"friendly society,\" meeting together once a month, to drink their  beer and consult about matters of mutual insurance and other topics of  more or less social and religious character.(34) But there is evidence to  show that the tie which united members of a \"frith-gild\" was stronger and  more solemn than any which binds the members of a friendly society or  voluntary association. The punishment of one who was guilty of breaking  his \"frith\" was practically banishment or death. Such a one, in  Athelstan's time, was ordered to abjure the country, which probably meant  no more than that he was to leave his burgh or perhaps the shire in which  he dwelt, but if ever he returned, he might be treated as a thief taken  \"hand-habbende\" or one taken with stolen goods upon him, in other words,  \"with the mainour.\"(35) A thief so taken might lawfully be killed by the  first man who met him, and the slayer was, according to the code of the  \"frith-gild,\" \"to be twelve pence the better for the deed.\"(36) Under  these circumstances, it is more reasonable to suppose, that the  \"frith-gild\" was not so much a voluntary association as one imposed upon  members of the community by some public authority.(37)    (M24)    The commercial supremacy of London, not only over Winchester but over  every other town in the kingdom, now becomes more distinct, for when  Athelstan appointed moneyers or minters throughout the country, he  assigned eight (the largest number of all) to London, whilst for  Winchester he appointed only six, other towns being provided with but one  or at most two.(38) The king, moreover, showed his predilection for London  by erecting a mansion house for himself within the city's walls.    The encouragement which Athelstan gave to commercial enterprise by  enacting, that any merchant who undertook successfully three voyages  across the high seas at his own cost (if not in his own vessel) should  rank as a thane,(39) must have affected the London burgess more than those  of any other town.    (M25)    Under Ethelred II, surnamed the \"Unready\" or \"redeless\" from his  indifference to the \"rede\" or council of his advisers, the city would  again have fallen into the hands of the Danes, but for the personal  courage displayed by its inhabitants and the protection which, by Alfred's  foresight, the walls were able to afford them. In 994, Olaf and Sweyn  sailed up the Thames with a large fleet and threatened to burn London.  Obstinate fighting took place, but the enemy, we are told, \"sustained more  harm and evil than they ever deemed that any townsman could do to them,  for the Holy Mother of God, on that day, manifested her mercy to the  townsmen and delivered them from their foes.\"(40)    (M26)    Matters might not have been so bad had not the king already committed the  fatal error of attempting to secure peace by buying off the enemy. In 991,  he had, with the consent of his witan, raised the sum of L10,000 with  which he had bribed the Danish host. This was the origin of the tax known  as Danegelt, which in after years became one of the chief financial  resources of the Crown and continued almost uninterruptedly down to the  reign of Henry II. The effect of the bribe was naturally enough to induce  the enemy to make further depredations whenever in want of money; and  accordingly, a Danish fleet threatened London the very next year (992) and  again in 994. On this last occasion, the same wretched expedient was  resorted to, and the Danes were again bought off.    (M27)    Nor was cowardice the only charge of which Ethelred was guilty. To this  must be added treachery and murder.
