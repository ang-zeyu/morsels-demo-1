Upon the whole, I have always considered him,  both in his lifetime and since his death, as approaching as nearly to  the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of  human frailty will permit.

The curiosity entertained by all civilized nations, of inquiring into  the exploits and adventures of their ancestors, commonly excites a  regret that the history of remote ages should always be so much involved  in obscurity, uncertainty, and contradiction. Ingenious men, possessed  of leisure, are apt to push their researches beyond the period in which  literary monuments are framed or preserved; without reflecting, that the  history of past events is immediately lost or disfigured when intrusted  to memory and oral tradition, and that the adventures of barbarous  nations, even if they were recorded, could afford little or no  entertainment to men born in a more cultivated age. The convulsions of  a civilized state usually compose the most instructive and most  interesting part of its history; but the sudden, violent, and unprepared  revolutions incident to barbarians, are so much guided by caprice, and  terminate so often in cruelty, that they disgust us by the uniformity of  their appearance; and it is rather fortunate for letters that they are  buried in silence and oblivion. The only certain means by which nations  can indulge their curiosity in researches concerning their remote  origin, is to consider the language, manners, and customs of their  ancestors, and to compare them with those of the neighboring nations.  The fables, which are commonly employed to supply the place of true  history, ought entirely to be disregarded; or if any exception be  admitted to this general rule, it can only be in favor of the ancient  Grecian fictions, which are so celebrated and so agreeable, that they  will ever be the objects of the attention of mankind. Neglecting,  therefore, all traditions, or rather tales, concerning the more early  history of Britain, we shall only consider the state of the inhabitants  as it appeared to the Romans on their invasion of this country: we shall  briefly run over the events which attended the conquest made by that  empire, as belonging more to Roman than British story: we shall hasten  through the obscure and uninteresting period of Saxon annals; and shall  reserve a more full narration for those times, when the truth is both  so well ascertained, and so complete, as to promise entertainment and  instruction to the reader.    All ancient writers agree in representing the first inhabitants of  Britain as a tribe of the Gauls or Celtae, who peopled that island from  the neighboring continent. Their language was the same, their manners,  their government, their superstition; varied only by those small  differences which time or a communication with the bordering nations  must necessarily introduce. The inhabitants of Gaul, especially in those  parts which lie contiguous to Italy, had acquired, from a commerce with  their southern neighbors, some refinement in the arts, which gradually  diffused themselves northwards, and spread but a very faint light over  this island. The Greek and Roman navigators or merchants (for there  were scarcely any other travellers in those ages) brought back the most  shocking accounts of the ferocity of the people, which they magnified,  as usual, in order to excite the admiration of their countrymen. The  south-east parts, however, of Britain had already, before the age  of Caesar, made the first and most requisite step towards a civil  settlement; and the Britons, by tillage and agriculture, had there  increased to a great multitude.[*]         [* Caesar, lib. iv.]    The other inhabitants of the island still maintained themselves by  pasture: they were clothed with skins of beasts: they dwelt in huts,  which they reared in the forests and marshes, with which the country was  covered: they shifted easily their habitation, when actuated either by  the hopes of plunder or the fear of an enemy: the convenience of feeding  their cattle was even a sufficient motive for removing their seats and  as they were ignorant of all the refinements of life, their wants and  their possessions were equally scanty and limited.    The Britons were divided into many small nations or tribes and being a  military people, whose sole property was then arms and their cattle, It  was impossible, after they had acquired a relish of liberty for their  princes or chieftains to establish any despotic authority over them.  Their governments, though monarchical,[*] were free, as well as those of  all the Celtic nations; and the common people seem even to have enjoyed  more liberty among them,[**] than among the nations of Gaul,[***] from  whom they were descended. Each state was divided into factions within  itself:[****] it was agitated with jealousy or animosity against the  neighboring states: and while the arts of peace were yet unknown, wars  were the chief occupation, and formed the chief object of ambition,  among the people.         [* Diod. Sic. lib. iv. Mela, lib. iii. cap. 6.       Strabo, lib. iv.]         [** Dion Cassius, lib. lxxv.]         [*** Caesar, lib. vi.]         [**** Tacit. Agr.]    The religion of the Britons was one of the most considerable parts of  their government; and the druids, who were their priests, possessed  great authority among them. Besides ministering at the altar, and  directing all religious duties, they presided over the education of  youth; they enjoyed an immunity from wars and taxes; they possessed  both the civil and criminal jurisdiction; they decided all controversies  among states as well as among private persons, and whoever refused to  submit to their decree was exposed to the most severe penalties. The  sentence of excommunication was pronounced against him: he was forbidden  access to the sacrifices or public worship: he was debarred all  intercourse with his fellow-citizens, even in the common affairs of  life: his company was universally shunned, as profane and dangerous:  he was refused the protection of law:[*] and death itself became an  acceptable relief from the misery and infamy to which he was exposed.  Thus the bands of government, which were naturally loose among that rude  and turbulent people, were happily corroborated by the terrors of their  superstition.         [* Caesar, lib. vi. Strabo, lib. iv.]    No species of superstition was ever more terrible than that of the  druids. Besides the severe penalties, which it was in the power of the  ecclesiastics to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal  transmigration of souls; and thereby extended their authority as far as  the fears of their timorous votaries. They practised their rites in  dark groves or other secret recesses;[*] and in order to throw a greater  mystery over their religion, they communicated their doctrines only to  the initiated, and strictly forbade the committing of them to writing,  lest they should at any time be exposed to the examination of the  profane vulgar.         [* Plin. lib. xii. cap. 1.]    Human sacrifices were practised among them: the spoils of war were  often devoted to their divinities; and they punished with the severest  tortures whoever dared to secrete any part of the consecrated offering:  these treasures they kept in woods and forests, secured by no other  guard than the terrors of their religion;[*] and this steady conquest  over human avidity may be regarded as more signal than their prompting  men to the most extraordinary and most violent efforts. No idolatrous  worship ever attained such an ascendant over mankind as that of the  ancient Gauls and Britons; and the Romans, after their conquest, finding  it impossible to reconcile those nations to the laws and institutions of  their masters, while it maintained its authority, were at last obliged  to abolish it by penal statutes; a violence which had never, in any  other instance, been practised by those tolerating conquerors.[**]         [* Caesar, lib. vi.]         [* Sueton. in vita Claudii.]          THE ROMANS.    The Britons had long remained in this rude but independent state, when  Caesar, having overrun all Gaul by his victories, first cast his eye on  their island. He was not allured either by its riches or its renown; but  being ambitious of carrying the Roman arms into a new world, then mostly  unknown, he took advantage of a short interval in his Gaulic wars, and  made an invasion on Britain. The natives, informed of his intention,  were sensible of the unequal contest, and endeavored to appease him by  submissions, which, however, retarded not the execution of his design.  After some resistance, he landed, as is supposed, at Deal, [Anno ante,  C. 55;] and having obtained several advantages over the Britons, and  obliged them to promise hostages for their future obedience, he was  constrained, by the necessity of his affairs, and the approach of  winter, to withdraw his forces into Gaul. The Britons relieved, from the  terror of his arms, neglected the performance of their stipulations; and  that haughty conqueror resolved next summer to chastise them for this  breach of treaty. He landed with a greater force; and though he found  a more regular resistance from the Britons, who had united under  Cassivelaunus, one of their petty princes, he discomfited them in every  action. He advanced into the country; passed the Thames in the face of  the enemy; took and burned the capital of Cassivelaunus; established his  ally, Mandubratius, in the sovereignty of the Trinobantes; and having  obliged the inhabitants to make him new submissions, he again returned  with his army into Gaul, and left the authority of the Romans more  nominal than real in this island.    The civil wars which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19212"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part B. (#4)"],[1,"in his  custody. These two malecontents took into the confederacy the earls of  Chester, Warrenne, Glocester, Hereford, Warwick, and Ferrers, who were  all disgusted on a like account. [**] They assembled an army, which the  king had not the power or courage to resist; and he was obliged to give  his brother satisfaction, by grants of much greater importance than the  manor, which had been the first ground of the quarrel.[***]    The character of the king, as he grew to man's estate, became every  day better known; and he was found in every respect unqualified for  maintaining a proper sway among those turbulent barons, whom the feudal  constitution subjected to his authority. Gentle, humane, and merciful  even to a fault, he seems to have been steady in no other circumstance  of his character; but to have received every impression from those who  surrounded him, and whom he loved, for the time, with the most imprudent  and most unreserved affection. Without activity or vigor, he was unfit  to conduct war; without policy or art, he was ill fitted to maintain  peace: his resentments, though hasty and violent, were not dreaded,  while he was found to drop them with such facility; his friendships  were little valued, because they were neither derived from choice,  nor maintained with constancy: a proper pageant of state in a regular  monarchy, where his ministers could have conducted all affairs in his  name and by his authority; but too feeble in those disorderly times  to sway a sceptre, whose weight depended entirely on the firmness and  dexterity of the hand which held it.         * M. Paris, p. 233.         ** M. Paris, p. 233.         *** M. Paris, p. 233.    The ablest and most virtuous minister that Henry ever possessed was  Hubert de Burgh;[*] a man who had been steady to the crown in the most  difficult and dangerous times, and who yet showed no disposition, in  the height of his power, to enslave or oppress the people. The only  exceptionable part of his conduct is that which is mentioned by Matthew  Paris,[**] if the fact be really true, and proceeded from Hubert's  advice, namely, the recalling publicly and the annulling of the charter  of forests, a concession so reasonable in itself, and so passionately  claimed both by the nobility and people: but it must be confessed that  this measure is so unlikely, both from the circumstances of the times  and character of the minister, that there is reason to doubt of its  reality, especially as it is mentioned by no other historian. Hubert,  while he enjoyed his authority, had an entire ascendant over Henry, and  was loaded with honors and favors beyond any other subject.    {1231.} Besides acquiring the property of many castles and manors, he  married the eldest sister of the king of Scots, was created earl of  Kent, and, by an unusual concession, was made chief justiciary of  England for life; yet Henry, in a sudden caprice, threw off his faithful  minister, and exposed him to the violent persecutions of his enemies.  Among other frivolous crimes objected to him, he was accused of gaining  the king's affections by enchantment, and of purloining from the royal  treasury a gem which had the virtue to render the wearer invulnerable,  and of sending this valuable curiosity to the prince of Wales.[***] The  nobility, who hated Hubert on account of his zeal in resuming the rights  and possessions of the crown, no sooner saw the opportunity favorable,  than they inflamed the king's animosity against him, and pushed him to  seek the total ruin of his minister. Hubert took sanctuary in a church:  the king ordered him to be dragged from thence: he recalled those  orders: he afterwards renewed them: he was obliged by the clergy to  restore him to the sanctuary: he constrained him soon after to surrender  himself prisoner, and he confined him in the castle of the Devizes.  Hubert made his escape, was expelled the kingdom, was again received  into favor, recovered a great share of the king's confidence, but  never showed any inclination to reinstate himself in power and  authority.[****]         * Ypod.

The man who succeeded him in the government of the king and kingdom, was  Peter, bishop of Winchester, a Poictevin by birth, who had been raised  by the late king, and who was no less distinguished by his arbitrary  principles and violent conduct, than by his courage and abilities. This  prelate had been left by King John justiciary and regent of the kingdom  during an expedition which that prince made into France; and his illegal  administration was one chief cause of that great combination among the  barons, which finally extorted from the crown the charter of liberties,  and laid the foundation of the English constitution. Henry, though  incapable, from his character, of pursuing the same violent maxims which  had governed his father, had imbibed the same arbitrary principles;  and in prosecution of Peter's advice, he invited over a great number of  Poictevins and other foreigners, who, he believed, could more safely be  trusted than the English, and who seemed useful to counterbalance the  great and independent power of the nobility.[*] Every office and command  was bestowed on these strangers; they exhausted the revenues of the  crown, already too much impoverished;[**] they invaded the rights of the  people; and their insolence, still more provoking than their power, drew  on them the hatred and envy of all orders of men in the kingdom.[***]    {1233.} The barons formed a combination against this odious ministry,  and withdrew from parliament, on pretence of the danger to which  they were exposed from the machinations of the Poictevins. When again  summoned to attend, they gave for answer, that the king should dismiss  his foreigners, otherwise they would drive both him and them out of  the kingdom, and put the crown on another head, more worthy to wear it:  [****] such was the style they used to their sovereign. They at  last came to parliament, but so well attended, that they seemed in a  condition to prescribe laws to the king and ministry.         * M. Paris, p. 263         ** Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 151.         *** M. Paris, p. 258         **** M. Paris, p 265.    Peter des Roches, however, had in the interval found means of sowing  dissension among them, and of bringing over to his party the earl of  Cornwall, as well as the earls of Lincoln and Chester. The confederates  were disconcerted in their measures: Richard, earl Mareschal, who had  succeeded to that dignity on the death of his brother William, was  chased into Wales; he thence withdrew into Ireland, where he  was treacherously murdered by the contrivance of the bishop of  Winchester.[*] The estates of the more obnoxious barons were  confiscated, without legal sentence or trial by their peers; [**] and  were bestowed with a profuse liberality on the Poictevins. Peter even  carried his insolence so far as to declare publicly, that the barons of  England must not pretend to put themselves on the same foot with those  of France, or assume the same liberties and privileges: the monarch in  the former country had a more absolute power than in the latter. It had  been more justifiable for him to have said, that men so unwilling to  submit to the authority of laws, could with the worst grace claim any  shelter or protection from them.    When the king at any time was checked in his illegal practices, and when  the authority of the Great Charter was objected to him, he was wont to  reply, \"Why should I observe this charter, which is neglected by all my  grandees, both prelates and nobility?\" It was very reasonably said to  him, \"You ought, sir, to set them the example.\" [***]    So violent a ministry as that of the bishop of Winchester could not be  of long duration; but its fall proceeded at last from the influence of  the church, not from the efforts of the nobles. Edmond, the primate,  came to court, attended by many of the other prelates, and represented  to the king the pernicious measures embraced by Peter des Roches, the  discontents of his people, the ruin of his affairs; and after requiring  the dismission of the minister and his associates, threatened him  with excommunication in case of his refusal. Henry, who knew that an  excommunication so agreeable to the sense of the people could not  fail of producing the most dangerous effects, was obliged to submit:  foreigners were banished; the natives were restored to their place in  council;[****] the primate, who was a man of prudence, and who took care  to execute the laws and observe the charter of liberties, bore the chief  sway in the government.    {1236.} But the English in vain flattered themselves that they should be  long free from the dominion of foreigners. The king, having married  Eleanor, daughter of the count of Provence,[*****] was surrounded by a  great number of strangers from that country, whom he caressed with the  fondest affection, and enriched by an imprudent generosity.[******]         * Chron. Dunst. vol. i p. 219.         ** M. Paris, p. 265.         *** M. Paris, p. 608.         **** M. Paris, p. 271, 272         ***** Rymer, vol. i. p. 448.         ****** M. Paris, p. 286.    The bishop of Valence, a prelate of the house of Savoy, and maternal  uncle to the queen, was his chief minister, and employed every art to  amass wealth for himself and his relations. Peter of Savoy, a brother of  the same family, was invested in the honor of Richmond, and received the  rich wardship of Earl Warrenne; Boniface of Savoy was promoted to the  see of Canterbury: many young ladies were invited over to Provence, and  married to the chief noblemen of "]]]
