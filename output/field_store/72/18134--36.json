TEXTS IN USE IN WESTERN EUROPE BEFORE THE AGE OF CHARLEMAGNE.    _Lombardic._ The national hand of Italy. Founded on the old Roman  cursive, it does not attain to any great beauty until the tenth or  eleventh century. Examples may be seen in Palæographical Society, pl.  95, and in the excellent lithographs published by the monks of Monte  Cassino (_Paleografia artistica di Monte Cassino_, Longobardo-Cassinese,  tav. xxxiv., etc.). A very fine example occurs in pl. xv., dated  1087-88. Its characteristic letters are _a_, _e_, _g_, _t_.    _Visigothic._ The national hand of Spain. Also founded on the old Roman  cursive. It becomes an established hand in the eighth century, and lasts  until the twelfth. Examples occur in Ewald and Loewe, _Exempla Scripturæ  Visigoticæ_, Heidelberg, 1883. It was at first very rude and illegible,  but afterwards became even handsome. A fine example exists in the  British Museum (Palæograph. Soc., pl. 48). Its characteristic letters  are _g_, _s_, _t_.    _Merovingian._ The national hand of France. A hand made up chiefly of  loops and angles in a cramped, irregular way. Its derivation the same as  the preceding. In the seventh century it is all but illegible. In the  eighth it is much better, and almost easy to read.    _Celtic_. The national hand of Ireland. It is founded on the demi-uncial  Roman, borrowed as to type from MSS. taken to Ireland by missionaries.  It is bold, clear, and often beautiful, lending itself to some of the  most astonishing feats of penmanship ever produced.    Such are the chief varieties of writing found in the MSS. produced  before the great revival of the arts and learning which took place  during the reign of Charles the Great (Karl der Grosse), known  familiarly as Charlemagne.    Wattenbach (_Schriftwesen_, _etc._) says that uncials date from the  second century A.D. From examples still extant of the fifth and  following centuries, it seems that while the Roman capitals were not  uncommon, in Celtic MSS. the form generally adopted was the uncial. It  was the form also usually chosen for ornamentation or imitation in those  Visigothic, Merovingian, or Lombardic MSS., which made such remarkable  use of fishes, birds, beasts, and plants for the construction of initial  letters and principal words, of which we see so many examples in the  elaborately illustrated Catalogue of the library at Laon by Ed. Fleury,  and in that of Cambray, by M. Durieux. Most of these pre-Carolingian  designs are barbarous in the extreme, dreadfully clumsy in execution,  but they evince considerable ingenuity and a strong predilection for  symbolism.    Before concluding this chapter perhaps something should be said  concerning the shape of books, though this is a matter somewhat outside  the scope of our proper subject. Yet, as the brief digression will  afford an opportunity for the explanation of certain terms used in MSS.,  we will avail ourselves of it.    The ancient form of writing upon skins and papyrus was that of the roll.  The Hebrew, Arabic, or Greek terms for this do not concern us, but its  Latin name was _volumen_, \"something rolled,\" and from this we obtain  our word volume. Such words as \"explicit liber primus\" etc., which we  often find in early MSS., refer to this roll-form; _explicare_ in Latin  meaning to unroll; hence, apropos of a chapter or book, to finish. When  transferred to the square form, or codex, it simply means, \"here ends  book first,\" etc.    The modern book shape first came into use with the beginning of the  Christian era under the name of codex. Here it will be necessary to  explain that _caudex_, _codex_, in Latin, meant a block of wood, and had  its humorous by-senses among the Roman dramatists, as the word block has  among ourselves, such as blockhead.[5] So _caudicalis provincia_ was a  jocular expression for the occupation of wood-splitting.    [5] Terence, _Heautont._, 5. 1, 4.    Whether the word had originally any connection with _cauda_, \"a tail,\"  is not here worth considering, as if so, it had long lost the  connection; and when used to mean a book, had only the sense of a board,  or a number of boards from two upwards, fastened together by means of  rings passed through holes made in their edges.    Probably the first use was as plain smooth boards only; examples of such  are still in existence. Then of boards thinly covered with, usually,  black wax. A pair of such tablets, wax-covered, was a common form of a  Roman pocket-or memorandum-book. It was also used as a means of  conveying messages, the reply being returned on the same tablets. The  method was to write on the wax with a fine-pointed instrument called a  style, the reverse end of which was flattened. When the person to whom  the message was sent had read it, he (or she) simply flattened out the  writing, smoothed it level, and then wrote the reply on the same wax.  School-children did their exercises on these tablets, housewives and  stewards kept their accounts on them, and on them literary people jotted  down their ideas as they do now in their pocket-books. Extant examples  of these early books, or tablets, are fairly numerous, and may be seen  in most public museums. A codex of two leaves was called a diptych; of  three, a triptych, etc. The codex form was used for legal documents,  wills, conveyances, and general correspondence. Hence the Roman postman  was called a _tabellarius_, the tablets containing correspondence being  tied with a thread or ribbon and sealed. This custom of sending letters  on tablets survived for some centuries after Augustan times. Wattenbach  gives several interesting instances of their mediæval use.[6]    [6] _Schriftwesen_, 48.    Of course when the tablet gave place to the codex of skin or paper, the  papyrus was too brittle and fragile for practical utility, and examples,  as we have seen, were very rare; but vellum soon became popular. We may  mention, in passing, that the papyrus roll gave us a word still in use  in diplomatics, the word _protocol_. The first sheet of a papyrus roll  was called the {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER OMICRON WITH TONOS~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~}. It  usually contained the name of place and date of manufacture of the  papyrus, and was stamped or marked with the name of the government  officer who had charge of the department.    In the vellum codex, though each leaf might have only one fold, and thus  technically be considered as a folio, the actual shape of it was nearly  square, hence its name of _codex quadratus_. When other forms of books,  such as octavo, duo-decimo, etc., came into use, it was in consequence  of the increased number of foldings. The gatherings, originally  quaternions or quires, became different, and those who undertake to  examine MSS. with respect to their completeness have to be familiar with  the various methods.[7] This kind of knowledge, however, though useful,  is by no means essential to the story of illumination.

CHAPTER IV    GREEK AND ROMAN ILLUMINATION    The first miniature painter--The Vatican Vergils--Methods of  painting--Origin of Christian art--The Vienna Genesis--The  Dioscorides--The Byzantine Revival.      It has been already stated that the earliest recorded miniature painter  was a lady named Lala of Cyzicus in the days of Augustus Cæsar, days  when Cyzicus was to Rome what Brussels is to Paris, or Brighton to  London. All her work, as far as we know, has perished. It was  portraiture on ivory, probably much the same as we see in the miniature  portraiture of the present day.    But this was not illumination. The kind of painting employed in the two  Vatican Vergils was, however, something approaching it. These two  precious volumes contain relics of Pagan art, but it is the very art  which was the basis and prototype of so-called Christian art of those  earliest examples found in the catacombs and in the first liturgical  books of Christian times.    The more ancient of the two Vergils referred to, No. 3225, which Labarte  (2nd ed., ii. 158) thinks to be a century older than the other, Sir M.D.  Wyatt considered as containing \"some of the best and most interesting  specimens of ancient painting which have come down to us. The design is  free and the colours applied with good effect, the whole presenting  classical art in the period of decline, but before its final  debasement.\" Whereas in the second MS., No. 3867, the style, though  still classical, is greatly debased, and probably, in addition to this,  by no means among the best work of its time. It is described as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#4)"],[1,"of the vocal apparatus above the larynx, the  mouth, nose, etc., it becomes clear that only long, patient, and  _intelligent_ study will lead to the highest results.    It should also be remembered that such an apparatus can easily acquire  habits which may last for life, for good or ill, artistically  considered. Such delicate mechanisms can also be easily injured or  hopelessly ruined; and, as a matter of fact, this is being done daily.  A great musical periodical has made the statement that thousands of  voices are being ruined annually, in America alone, by incompetent  teaching. My experience when a practising laryngologist made me  acquainted with the extent of the ruin that may be brought about by  incorrect methods of using the voice, both as regards the throat and  the voice itself; and contact with teachers and students has so  impressed me with the importance of placing voice-production on a  sound foundation, not only artistic but physiological, that I have  felt constrained to tell others who may be willing to hear me what I  have learned as to correct methods, with some reference also to wrong  ones, though the latter are so numerous that I shall not be able to  find the space to deal at length with them.    The correct methods of singing and speaking are always, of necessity,  physiological. Others may satisfy a vitiated or undeveloped public  taste, but what is artistically sound is also physiological. None have  ever sung with more ease than those taught by the correct methods of  the old Italian masters; as none run so easily as the wisely trained  athlete, and none endure so well. People in singing and speaking will,  as in other cases, get what they work for, but have no right to expect  to sing or speak effectively by inspiration, any more than the athlete  to win a race because he is born naturally fleet of foot or with a  quick intelligence. In each case the ideas are converted into  performance, the results attained, by the exercise of neuro-muscular  mechanisms. I am most anxious that it shall be perceived that this is  the case, that the same laws apply to voice-production as to running  or any other exercise. The difference is one of delicacy and  complexity so far as the body is concerned.    It will be understood that I speak only of the technique. For art  there must be more than technique, but there is no art without good  methods of execution, which constitute technique. The latter is  nothing more than method--manner of performance. Behind these methods  of performance, or the simplest part of them, there must be some idea.  The more intelligent the student, speaker or singer, as to his art and  generally, the better for the teacher who instructs scientifically,  though such intelligence is largely lost to the teacher who depends on  tradition and pure imitation. In the present work I shall be so  concerned with the physical that I shall be able only to refer briefly  to the part that intelligence and feeling play in the result.    The qualifications for the successful treatment of vocal  physiology--that is, such a discussion of the subject as shall lead to  a clear comprehension of the nature of the principles involved, and  place them on a practical foundation, make them at once usable in  actual study and in teaching--such qualifications are many, and, in  their totality and in an adequate degree, difficult to attain. After  more than twenty years of the best study I could give to this subject  in both a theoretical and a practical manner, I feel that I have  something to say which may be useful to a large class, and, so far as  I know, that is my reason for writing this book.    For myself music is indispensable. The one instrument we all possess  is a voice-mechanism. I am one of those who regret that so little  attention is paid, especially in America, to pleasing and expressive  use of the voice in ordinary conversation. Yet how much pleasure  cannot a beautiful speaking voice convey! The college undergraduate  rarely finds vocal study among the requirements, in spite of the fact  that the voice is an instrument that he will use much more than the  pen. The truth is, the home methods of voice-production are those we  are most likely to carry with us through life, and, unfortunately,  little attention is given to the subject.    Sometimes a love of sweet sounds may be a hidden cause for much that  would otherwise be inexplicable in an entire career, as in my own  case. It led to an early study of singers and actors and their  performances; it gave rise to an effort to form a voice that would  meet the requirements of an unusually sensitive ear; it led to the  practice and teaching of elocution, and, later, to much communion with  voice-users, both singers and speakers. In the meantime came medical  practice, with speedy specialization as a laryngologist, when there  were daily consultations with singers and speakers who had employed  wrong methods of voice-production; this again led on to the scientific  investigation of voice problems, with a view of settling certain  disputed points; then came renewed and deeper study of music, both as  an art and as a science, with a profound interest in the study of the  philosophy of musical art and the psychological study of the musical  artist, all culminating in this attempt to help those who will listen  to me without prejudice. I do not think I know all that is to be  known, but I believe I do know how to form and preserve the voice  according to physiological principles; I at least ask the reader to  give my teachings and recommendations a fair trial. He shall have  reasons for what is presented and recommended to him.    Once more let it be said that I do not deny that good practical  results may follow teaching that is not put before the pupil as  physiology; but what is claimed for physiological teaching is that--    1. It is more rational. The student sees that things must be thus and  so, and not otherwise.    2. Faults can be the better recognized and explained.    3. The student can the more surely guide his own development, and meet  the stress and storm that sooner or later come to every professional  voice-user.    4. Injured voices can be the more effectively restored.    5. The physical welfare of the student is advanced--a matter which I  find is often neglected by teachers of music, though more so in the  case of instrumental than vocal teachers.    6. The student can much more effectively learn from the performances  of others, because he sees that singing and speaking are physical  processes leading to artistic ends. This is perhaps one of the most  valuable results, and I can testify to the greater readiness with  which analysis of a performance can be made after even moderate  advancement. The teacher who is wise will encourage the student to  hear those who excel, and to analyze the methods which successful  artists employ. The student can much more readily accomplish this than  detect the mental movements of the artist, though the two really go  hand in hand to a large extent.    The above are some of the advantages, but by no means all, of a method  of study of voice-production which I must claim is the only rational  one--certainly, the only one that rests on a scientific foundation.    It does not follow that such study, to be scientific, shall be made  repellent by the use of technical terms the significance of which the  reader is left to guess at, but finds unexplained. I fear such  treatment of vocal physiology has brought it into disrepute. The aim  of the writer will be to give a clear scientific treatment of the  subject, which shall not be obscured by unexplained technical terms,  and which shall be _practical_--capable of immediate use by student  and teacher. If he did not believe the latter possible he would not  think it worth while to attempt the former, especially as this has  often been done before, he regrets to say, badly enough.    Although the author has not now the tune to give regular lessons in  voice-production, he is frequently consulted, especially when abroad,  during his vacations, by speakers and especially singers who are  anxious to learn how they may increase their efficiency in the  profession by which they earn their livelihood and make their  reputation; and the reader may be gratified to learn how, in such  cases, the writer applies the principles he so strongly recommends to  others.    Let two or three illustrations suffice:    1. A tenor of world renown consulted him in regard to the position of  the larynx in singing, as he had a suspicion that his practice was not  correct, inasmuch as his voice seemed to be deteriorating to some  extent. The answer to his question need not be given here, as this  subject is discussed adequately in a later chapter.    2. The second was the case of a young lady, an amateur singer, who was  anxious to know why she failed to get satisfactory results. The author  heard her in a large room, without any accompaniment (to cover up  defects, etc.), and standing at first at some distance from her, then  nearer. Her tones were delightfully pure and beautiful, but her  performance suggested rather the sound of some instrument than singing  in the proper sense. It was impossible to learn the ideas to be  imparted, as the words could not be distinctly made out; there was a  monotony in the whole performance, though, it must be confessed, a  beautiful monotony, and there was a total lack of that vigor and  sureness that both educated and uneducated listeners must be made to  feel, or there results a sense of dissatisfaction, if not even  irritation.    The beauty of tone was owing to a production that was to a certain  extent sound, and this explained why the voice carried well in spite  of its being small. This young lady was well educated, had heard much  good music, possessed a sensitive ear and a fine aesthetic taste, and,  perhaps"]]]
