Now or never must music be in tune, for the youth must dance and sing  to get them a heat, while the aged sit by the fire. The country maid  leaves half her market, and must be sent again, if she forgets a pack  of cards on Christmas eve. Great is the contention of Holly and Ivy,  whether master or dame wears the breeches. Dice and cards benefit the  butler; and if the cook do not lack wit, he will sweetly lick his  fingers.\"    [Illustration]    I was roused from this fit of luxurious meditation by a shout from my  little travelling companions. They had been looking out of the  coach-windows for the last few miles, recognising every tree and cottage  as they approached home, and now there was a general burst of  joy--\"There's John! and there's old Carlo! and there's Bantam!\" cried  the happy little rogues, clapping their hands.    At the end of a lane there was an old sober-looking servant in livery  waiting for them: he was accompanied by a superannuated pointer, and by  the redoubtable Bantam, a little old rat of a pony, with a shaggy mane  and long rusty tail, who stood dozing quietly by the roadside, little  dreaming of the bustling times that awaited him.    I was pleased to see the fondness with which the little fellows leaped  about the steady old footman, and hugged the pointer, who wriggled his  whole body for joy. But Bantam was the great object of interest; all  wanted to mount at once; and it was with some difficulty that John  arranged that they should ride by turns, and the eldest should ride  first.    [Illustration]    Off they set at last; one on the pony, with the dog bounding and barking  before him, and the others holding John's hands; both talking at once,  and overpowering him by questions about home, and with school anecdotes.  I looked after them with a feeling in which I do not know whether  pleasure or melancholy predominated: for I was reminded of those days  when, like them, I had neither known care nor sorrow, and a holiday was  the summit of earthly felicity. We stopped a few moments afterwards to  water the horses, and on resuming our route, a turn of the road brought  us in sight of a neat country-seat. I could just distinguish the forms  of a lady and two young girls in the portico, and I saw my little  comrades, with Bantam, Carlo, and old John, trooping along the carriage  road. I leaned out of the coach-window, in hopes of witnessing the happy  meeting, but a grove of trees shut it from my sight.    [Illustration]    In the evening we reached a village where I had determined to pass the  night. As we drove into the great gateway of the inn, I saw on one side  the light of a rousing kitchen fire, beaming through a window. I  entered, and admired, for the hundredth time, that picture of  convenience, neatness, and broad honest enjoyment, the kitchen of an  English inn. It was of spacious dimensions, hung round with copper and  tin vessels highly polished, and decorated here and there with a  Christmas green. Hams, tongues, and flitches of bacon, were suspended  from the ceiling; a smoke-jack made its ceaseless clanking beside the  fireplace, and a clock ticked in one corner. A well-scoured deal table  extended along one side of the kitchen, with a cold round of beef, and  other hearty viands upon it, over which two foaming tankards of ale  seemed mounting guard. Travellers of inferior order were preparing to  attack this stout repast, while others sat smoking and gossiping over  their ale on two high-backed oaken seats beside the fire. Trim  housemaids were hurrying backwards and forwards under the directions of  a fresh, bustling landlady; but still seizing an occasional moment to  exchange a flippant word, and have a rallying laugh, with the group  round the fire. The scene completely realised Poor Robin's humble idea  of the comforts of mid-winter.    [Illustration]              Now trees their leafy hats do bare,            To reverence Winter's silver hair;            A handsome hostess, merry host,            A pot of ale now and a toast,            Tobacco and a good coal fire,            Are things this season doth require.[A]    I had not been long at the inn when a post-chaise drove up to the door.  A young gentleman stepped out, and by the light of the lamps I caught a  glimpse of a countenance which I thought I knew. I moved forward to get  a nearer view, when his eye caught mine. I was not mistaken; it was  Frank Bracebridge, a sprightly good-humoured young fellow, with whom I  had once travelled on the Continent. Our meeting was extremely cordial;  for the countenance of an old fellow-traveller always brings up the  recollection of a thousand pleasant scenes, odd adventures, and  excellent jokes. To discuss all these in a transient interview at an inn  was impossible; and finding that I was not pressed for time, and was  merely making a tour of observation, he insisted that I should give him  a day or two at his father's country-seat, to which he was going to pass  the holidays, and which lay at a few miles' distance. \"It is better than  eating a solitary Christmas dinner at an inn,\" said he; \"and I can  assure you of a hearty welcome in something of the old-fashion style.\"  His reasoning was cogent; and I must confess the preparation I had seen  for universal festivity and social enjoyment had made me feel a little  impatient of my loneliness. I closed, therefore, at once with his  invitation: the chaise drove up to the door; and in a few moments I was  on my way to the family mansion of the Bracebridges.

CARTWRIGHT.    [Illustration]          CHRISTMAS EVE      [Illustration: I]    It was a brilliant moonlight night, but extremely cold; our chaise  whirled rapidly over the frozen ground; the post-boy smacked his whip  incessantly, and a part of the time his horses were on a gallop. \"He  knows where he is going,\" said my companion, laughing, \"and is eager to  arrive in time for some of the merriment and good cheer of the servants'  hall. My father, you must know, is a bigoted devotee of the old school,  and prides himself upon keeping up something of old English  hospitality. He is a tolerable specimen of what you will rarely meet  with now-a-days in its purity, the old English country gentleman; for  our men of fortune spend so much of their time in town, and fashion is  carried so much into the country, that the strong rich peculiarities of  ancient rural life are almost polished away. My father, however, from  early years, took honest Peacham[B] for his text book, instead of  Chesterfield: he determined, in his own mind, that there was no  condition more truly honourable and enviable than that of a country  gentleman on his paternal lands, and, therefore, passes the whole of his  time on his estate. He is a strenuous advocate for the revival of the  old rural games and holiday observances, and is deeply read in the  writers, ancient and modern, who have treated on the subject. Indeed,  his favourite range of reading is among the authors who flourished at  least two centuries since; who, he insists, wrote and thought more like  true Englishmen than any of their successors. He even regrets sometimes  that he had not been born a few centuries earlier, when England was  itself, and had its peculiar manners and customs. As he lives at some  distance from the main road, in rather a lonely part of the country,  without any rival gentry near him, he has that most enviable of all  blessings to an Englishman, an opportunity of indulging the bent of his  own humour without molestation. Being representative of the oldest  family in the neighbourhood, and a great part of the peasantry being his  tenants, he is much looked up to, and, in general, is known simply by  the appellation of 'The Squire;' a title which has been accorded to the  head of the family since time immemorial. I think it best to give you  these hints about my worthy old father, to prepare you for any little  eccentricities that might otherwise appear absurd.\"    We had passed for some time along the wall of a park, and at length the  chaise stopped at the gate. It was in a heavy magnificent old style, of  iron bars, fancifully wrought at top into flourishes and flowers. The  huge square columns that supported the gate were surmounted by the  family crest. Close adjoining was the porter's lodge, sheltered under  dark fir-trees, and almost buried in shrubbery.    [Illustration]    The post-boy rang a large porter's bell, which resounded through the  still frosty air, and was answered by the distant barking of dogs, with  which the mansion-house seemed garrisoned. An old woman immediately  appeared at the gate. As the moonlight fell strongly upon her, I had a  full view of a little primitive dame, dressed very much in the antique  taste, with a neat kerchief and stomacher, and her silver hair peeping  from under a cap of snowy whiteness. She came curtseying forth, with  many expressions of simple joy at seeing her young master. Her husband,  it seems, was up at the house keeping Christmas eve in the servants'  hall; they could not do without him, as he was the best hand at a song  and story in the household.    [Illustration: \"It was in a heavy magnificent old style, of iron bars,  fancifully wrought at top into flourishes and flowers.\"--PAGE 46.]    My friend proposed that we should alight and walk through the park to  the hall, which was at no great distance, while the chaise should follow  on.

It  was an indication of his strange obsession, in regard to horses, that  he never would see that Lucy was teasing him. As far as horses were  concerned he lacked a sense of humor. Anything connected with his  horses was of intense interest.    \"I'd dearly love to own Plume,\" said Lucy, demurely.    Bostil had grown red in the face and now he was on the rack. The  monstrous selfishness of a rider who had been supreme in his day could  not be changed.    \"Girl, I--I thought you hadn't no use for Plume,\" he stammered.    \"I haven't--the jade! She threw me once. I've never forgiven her ....  Dad, I'm only teasing you. Don't I know you couldn't give one of those  racers away? You couldn't!\"    \"Lucy, I reckon you're right,\" Bostil burst out in immense relief.    \"Dad, I'll bet if Cordts gets me and holds me as ransom for the  King--as he's threatened--you'll let him have me!\"    \"Lucy, now thet ain't funny!\" complained the father.    \"Dear Dad, keep your old racers! But, remember, I'm my father's  daughter. I can love a horse, too. Oh, if I ever get the one I want to  love! A wild horse--a desert stallion--pure Arabian--broken right by an  Indian! If I ever get him, Dad, you look out! For I'll run away from  Sarch and Ben--and I'll beat the King!\"    The hamlet of Bostil's Ford had a singular situation, though,  considering the wonderful nature of that desert country, it was not  exceptional. It lay under the protecting red bluff that only Lucy  Bostil cared to climb. A hard-trodden road wound down through rough  breaks in the canyon wall to the river. Bostil's house, at the head of  the village, looked in the opposite direction, down the sage slope that  widened like a colossal fan. There was one wide street bordered by  cottonwoods and cabins, and a number of gardens and orchards, beginning  to burst into green and pink and white. A brook ran out of a ravine in  the huge bluff, and from this led irrigation ditches. The red earth  seemed to blossom at the touch of water.    The place resembled an Indian encampment--quiet, sleepy, colorful, with  the tiny-streams of water running everywhere, and lazy columns of blue  wood-smoke rising. Bostil's Ford was the opposite of a busy village,  yet its few inhabitants, as a whole, were prosperous. The wants of  pioneers were few. Perhaps once a month the big, clumsy flatboat was  rowed across the river with horses or cattle or sheep. And the season  was now close at hand when for weeks, sometimes months, the river was  unfordable. There were a score of permanent families, a host of merry,  sturdy children, a number of idle young men, and only one girl--Lucy  Bostil. But the village always had transient inhabitants--friendly Utes  and Navajos in to trade, and sheep-herders with a scraggy, woolly  flock, and travelers of the strange religious sect identified with Utah  going on into the wilderness. Then there were always riders passing to  and fro, and sometimes unknown ones regarded with caution.  Horse-thieves sometimes boldly rode in, and sometimes were able to sell  or trade. In the matter of horse-dealing Bostil's Ford was as bold as  the thieves.    Old Brackton, a man of varied Western experience, kept the one store,  which was tavern, trading-post, freighter's headquarters, blacksmith's  shop, and any thing else needful. Brackton employed riders, teamsters,  sometimes Indians, to freight supplies in once a month from Durango.  And that was over two hundred miles away. Sometimes the supplies did  not arrive on time--occasionally not at all. News from the outside  world, except that elicited from the taciturn travelers marching into  Utah, drifted in at intervals. But it was not missed. These wilderness  spirits were the forerunners of a great, movement, and as such were  big, strong, stern, sufficient unto themselves. Life there was made  possible by horses. The distant future, that looked bright to  far-seeing men, must be and could only be fulfilled through the  endurance and faithfulness of horses. And then, from these men, horses  received the meed due them, and the love they were truly worth. The  Navajo was a nomad horseman, an Arab of the Painted Desert, and the Ute  Indian was close to him. It was they who developed the white riders of  the uplands as well as the wild-horse wrangler or hunter.    Brackton's ramshackle establishment stood down at the end of the  village street. There was not a sawed board in all that structure, and  some of the pine logs showed how they had been dropped from the bluff.  Brackton, a little old gray man, with scant beard, and eyes like those  of a bird, came briskly out to meet an incoming freighter. The wagon  was minus a hind wheel, but the teamster had come in on three wheels  and a pole. The sweaty, dust-caked, weary, thin-ribbed mustangs, and  the gray-and-red-stained wagon, and the huge jumble of dusty packs,  showed something of what the journey had been.    \"Hi thar, Red Wilson, you air some late gettin' in,\" greeted old  Brackton.    Red Wilson had red eyes from fighting the flying sand, and red dust  pasted in his scraggy beard, and as he gave his belt an upward hitch  little red clouds flew from his gun-sheath.    \"Yep. An' I left a wheel an' part of the load on the trail,\" he said.    With him were Indians who began to unhitch the teams. Riders lounging  in the shade greeted Wilson and inquired for news. The teamster replied  that travel was dry, the water-holes were dry, and he was dry. And his  reply gave both concern and amusement.    \"One more trip out an' back--thet's all, till it rains,\" concluded  Wilson.    Brackton led him inside, evidently to alleviate part of that dryness.    Water and grass, next to horses, were the stock subject of all riders.    \"It's got oncommon hot early,\" said one.    \"Yes, an' them northeast winds--hard this spring,\" said another.    \"No snow on the uplands.\"    \"Holley seen a dry spell comin'. Wal, we can drift along without  freighters. There's grass an' water enough here, even if it doesn't  rain.\"    \"Sure, but there ain't none across the river.\"    \"Never was, in early season. An' if there was it'd be sheeped off.\"    \"Creech'll be fetchin' his hosses across soon, I reckon.\"    \"You bet he will. He's trainin' for the races next month.\"    \"An' when air they comin' off?\"    \"You got me. Mebbe Van knows.\"    Some one prodded a sleepy rider who lay all his splendid lithe length,  hat over his eyes. Then he sat up and blinked, a lean-faced, gray-eyed  fellow, half good-natured and half resentful.    \"Did somebody punch me?\"    \"Naw, you got nightmare! Say, Van, when will the races come off?\"    \"Huh! An' you woke me for thet? ... Bostil says in a few weeks, soon as  he hears from the Indians. Plans to have eight hundred Indians here,  an' the biggest purses an' best races ever had at the Ford.\"    \"You'll ride the King again?\"    \"Reckon so. But Bostil is kickin' because I'm heavier than I was,\"  replied the rider.    \"You're skin an' bones at thet.\"    \"Mebbe you'll need to work a little off, Van. Some one said Creech's  Blue Roan was comin' fast this year.\"    \"Bill, your mind ain't operatin',\" replied Van, scornfully. \"Didn't I  beat Creech's hosses last year without the King turnin' a hair?\"    \"Not if I recollect, you didn't. The Blue Roan wasn't runnin'.\"    Then they argued, after the manner of friendly riders, but all earnest,  an eloquent in their convictions. The prevailing opinion was that  Creech's horse had a chance, depending upon condition and luck.    The argument shifted upon the arrival of two new-comers, leading  mustangs and apparently talking trade. It was manifest that these  arrivals were not loath to get the opinions of others.    \"Van, there's a hoss!\" exclaimed one.    \"No, he ain't,\" replied Van.    And that diverse judgment appeared to be characteristic throughout. The  strange thing was that Macomber, the rancher, had already traded his  mustang and money to boot for the sorrel. The deal, whether wise or  not, had been consummated. Brackton came out with Red Wilson, and they  had to have their say.    \"Wal, durned if some of you fellers ain't kind an' complimentary,\"  remarked Macomber, scratching his head. \"But then every feller can't  have hoss sense.\" Then, looking up to see Lucy Bostil coming along the  road, he brightened as if with inspiration.    Lucy was at home among them, and the shy eyes of the younger riders,  especially Van, were nothing if not revealing. She greeted them with a  bright smile, and when she saw Brackton she burst out:    \"Oh, Mr. Brackton, the wagon's in, and did my box come? ... To-day's my  birthday.\"    \"'Deed it did, Lucy; an' many more happy ones to you!\" he replied,  delighted in her delight. \"But it's too heavy for you. I'll send it  up--or mebbe one of the boys--\"    Five riders in unison eagerly offered their services and looked as if  each had spoken first. Then Macomber addressed her:    \"Miss Lucy, you see this here sorrel?\"    \"Ah! the same lazy crowd and the same old story--a horse trade!\"  laughed Lucy.    \"There's a little difference of opinion,\" said Macomber, politely  indicating the riders. \"Now, Miss Lucy, we-all know you're a judge of a  hoss. And as good as thet you tell the truth. Thet ain't in some  hoss-traders I know.... What do you think of this mustang?\"    Macomber had eyes of enthusiasm for his latest acquisition, but some of  the cock-sureness had been knocked out of him by the blunt riders.    \"Macomber, aren't you a great one to talk?\" queried Lucy, severely.  \"Didn't you get around Dad and trade him an old, blind, knock-kneed bag  of bones for a perfectly good pony--one I liked to ride?\"    The riders shouted with laughter while the rancher struggled with  confusion.    \"'Pon my word, Miss Lucy, I'm surprised you could think thet of such an  old friend of yours--an' your Dad's, too. I'm hopin' he doesn't side  altogether with you.\"    \"Dad and I never"]]]
