If I am doomed to be  assassinated, it may aid you; if not in avenging me, in saving  others from my fate. I fear I shall never see you again.  A  cloud of horror settles upon me like a pall. Do not touch the  slipper, nor the case containing it.                                                      EDWARD DEEPING.    \"It is almost incredible!\" I said hoarsely.    Bristol returned the letter to me without a word, and turning to  Lester, who had reentered carrying a heavy pick-axe, he attacked  the oblong box with savage energy.    Through the house of death the sound of the blows echoed and rang  with a sort of sacrilegious mockery.  The box fell to pieces.    \"My God!  look, sir!\"    Lester was the trembling speaker.    The box, I have said, was but three feet long by one foot square,  and had clearly defied poor Deeping's efforts to open it.  But a  crescent-shaped knife, wet with blood, lay within!          CHAPTER V    THE OCCUPANT OF THE BOX      Dimly to my ears came the ceaseless murmur of London.  The night now  was far advanced, and not a sound disturbed the silence of the court  below my windows.    Professor Deeping's \"Assyrian Mythology\" lay open before me, beside  it my notebook.  A coal dropped from the fire, and I half started up  out of my chair.  My nerves were all awry, and I had more than my  horrible memories of the murdered man to thank for it.  Let me  explain what I mean.    When, after assisting, or endeavouring to assist, Bristol at his  elaborate inquiries, I had at last returned to my chambers, I had  become the victim of a singular delusion--though one common enough  in the case of persons whose nerves are overwrought.  I had thought  myself followed.    During the latter part of my journey I found myself constantly  looking from the little window at the rear of the cab.  I had an  impression that some vehicle was tracking us.  Then, when I  discharged the man and walked up the narrow passage to the court,  it was fear of a skulking form that dodged from shadow to shadow  which obsessed me.    Finally, as I entered the hall and mounted the darkened stair, from  the first landing I glanced down into the black well beneath.  Blazing yellow eyes, I thought, looked up at me!    I will confess that I leapt up the remaining flight of stairs to my  door, and, safely within, found myself trembling as if with a palsy.    When I sat down to write (for sleep was an impossible proposition)  I placed my revolver upon the table beside me.  I cannot say why.  It afforded me some sense of protection, I suppose.  My conclusions,  thus far, amounted to the following--    The apparition of the phantom scimitar was due to the presence of  someone who, by means of the moonlight, or of artificial light,  cast a reflection of such a weapon as that found in the oblong chest  upon the wall of a darkened apartment--as, Deeping's stateroom on  the Mandalay, his study, etc.    A group of highly efficient assassins, evidently Moslem fanatics,  who might or might not be of the ancient order of the Hashishin,  had pursued the stolen slipper to England.  They had severed any  hand, other than that of a Believer, which had touched the case  containing it.  (The Coptic porter was a Christian.)    Uncertain, possibly, of Deeping's faith, or fearful of endangering  the success of their efforts by an outrage upon him en route, they  had refrained from this until his arrival at his house.  He had  been warned of his impending end by Ahmad Ahmadeen.    Who was Ahmadeen?  And who was his beautiful associate?  I found  myself unable, at present, to answer either of those questions.  In  order to gain access to Professor Deeping, who so carefully secluded  himself, a box had been sent to him by ordinary carrier.  (As I sat  at my table, Scotland Yard was busy endeavouring to trace the  sender.)  Respecting this box we had made an extraordinary discovery.    It was of the kind used by Eastern conjurors for what is generally  known as \"the Box Trick.\"  That is to say, it could only be opened  (short of smashing it) from the inside!  You will remember what we  found within it?  Consider this with the new fact, above, and to  what conclusion do you come?    Something (it is not possible to speak of someone in connection with  so small a box) had been concealed inside, and had killed Professor  Deeping whilst he was actually engaged in endeavouring to force it  open.  This inconceivable creature had then searched the study for  the slipper--or for the key of the safe.  Interrupted and trapped  by the arrival of the police, the creature had returned to the box,  re-closed it, and had actually been there when the study was  searched!    For a creature so small as the murderous thing in the box to slip  out during the confusion, and at some time prior to Bristol's  arrival, was no difficult matter.  The inspector and I were certain  that these were the facts.    But what was this creature?    I turned to the chapter in \"Assyrian Mythology\"--\"The Tradition  of the Hashishin.\"    The legends which the late Professor Deeping had collected relative  to this sect of religious murderers were truly extraordinary.  Of  the cult's extinction at the time of writing he was clearly certain,  but he referred to the popular belief, or Moslem legend, that, since  Hassan of Khorassan, there had always been a Sheikh-al-jebal, and  that a dreadful being known as Hassan of Aleppo was the present  holder of the title.    He referred to the fact that De Sacy has shown the word Assassin  to be derived from Hashishin, and quoted El-Idrisi to the same  end.  The Hashishin performed their murderous feats under the  influence of hashish, or Indian hemp; and during the state of  ecstasy so induced, according to Deeping, they acquired powers  almost superhuman.  I read how they could scale sheer precipices,  pass fearlessly along narrow ledges which would scarce afford  foothold for a rat, cast themselves from great heights unscathed,  and track one marked for death in such a manner as to remain unseen  not only by the victim but by others about him.  At this point of  my studies I started, in a sudden nervous panic, and laid my hand  upon my revolver.    I thought of the eyes which had seemed to look up from the black  well of the staircase--I thought of the horrible end of this man  whose book lay upon the table ... and I thought I heard a faint  sound outside my study door!    The key of Deeping's safe, and his letter to me, lay close by my  hand.  I slipped them into a drawer and locked it.  With every  nerve, it seemed, strung up almost to snapping point, I mechanically  pursued my reading.    \"At the time of the Crusades,\" wrote Deeping, \"there was a story  current of this awful Order which I propose to recount.  It is one  of the most persistent dealing with the Hashishin, and is related  to-day of the apparently mythical Hassan of Aleppo.  I am disposed  to believe that at one time it had a solid foundation, for a  similar practice was common in Ancient Egypt and is mentioned by  Georg Ebers.\"    My door began very slowly to open!    Merciful God!  What was coming into the room!    So very slowly, so gently, nay, all but imperceptibly, did it move,  that had my nerves been less keenly attuned I doubt not I should  have remained unaware of the happening.  Frozen with horror, I sat  and watched.  Yet my mental condition was a singular one.    My direct gaze never quitted the door, but in some strange fashion  I saw the words of the next paragraph upon the page before me!    \"As making peculiarly efficient assassins, when under the influence  of the drug, and as being capable of concealing themselves where  a normal man could not fail to be detected--\"    (At this moment I remembered that my bathroom window was open, and  that the waste-pipe passed down the exterior wall.)    \"--the Sheikh-al-jebal took young boys of a certain desert tribe,  and for eight hours of every day, until their puberty, confined them  in a wooden frame--\"    What looked like a reed was slowly inserted through the opening  between door and doorpost!  It was brought gradually around  ... until it pointed directly toward me!    I seemed to put forth a mighty mental effort, shaking off the icy  hand of fear which held me inactive in my chair.  A saving instinct  warned me--and I ducked my head.    Something whirred past me and struck the wall behind.    Revolver in hand, I leapt across the room, dashed the door open,  and fired blindly--again--and again--and again--down the  passage.    And in the brief gleams I saw it!    I cannot call it man, but I saw the thing which, I doubt not, had  killed poor Deeping with the crescent-knife and had propelled a  poison-dart at me.    It was a tiny dwarf!  Neither within nor without a freak exhibition  had I seen so small a human being!  A kind of supernatural dread  gripped me by the throat at sight of it.  As it turned with animal  activity and bounded into my bathroom, I caught a three-quarter  view of the creature's swollen, incredible head--which was nearly  as large as that of a normal man!    Never while my mind serves me can I forget that yellow, grinning  face and those canine fangs--the tigerish, blazing eyes--set in  the great, misshapen head upon the tiny, agile body.    Wildly, I fired again.  I hurled myself forward and dashed into  the room.    Like nothing so much as a cat, the gleaming body (the dwarf was  but scantily clothed) streaked through the open window!    Certain death, I thought, must be his lot upon the stones of the  court far below.  I ran and looked down, shaking in every limb,  my mind filled with a loathing terror unlike anything I had ever  known.    Brilliant moonlight flooded the pavement beneath; for twenty yards  to left and right every stone was visible.    The court was empty!    Human, homely London moved and wrought intimately about me;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21272"],[0,"The Bibliotaph, and Other People (#4)"],[1,"to secure a second edition of Henry Crabb Robinson's  _Diary_ was in better case than he who had bothered himself to obtain  a first. When it fell in with his mood to argue against that which he  himself most affected, he would quote the childish bit of doggerel  beginning 'The first the worst, the second the same,' and then grow  eloquent over the dainty Templeman Hazlitts which are chiefly third  editions. He thought it absurd to worry over a first issue of  Carlyle's _French Revolution_ if it were possible to buy at moderate  price a copy of the third edition, which is a well-nigh perfect book,  'good to the touch and grateful to the eye.' But this lover of books  grew fierce in his special mania if you hinted that it was also  foolish to spend a large sum on an _editio princeps_ of _Paradise  Lost_ or of _Robinson Crusoe_. There are certain authors concerning  the desirability of whose first editions it must not be disputed.    The singular readiness with which bookish treasures fell into his way  astonished less fortunate buyers. Rare Stevensons dropped into his  hand like ripe fruit from a tree. The most inaccessible of pamphlets  fawned upon him, begging to be purchased, just as the succulent little  roast pigs in _The New Paul and Virginia_ run about with knives and  forks in their sides pleading to be eaten. The Bibliotaph said he did  not despair of buying Poe's _Tamerlane_ for twenty-five cents one of  these days; and that a rarity he was sure to get sooner or later was a  copy of that English newspaper which announced Shelley's death under  the caption _Now he Knows whether there is a Hell or Not_.    He unconsciously followed Heber in that he disliked large-paper  copies. Heber would none of them because they took up too much room;  their ample borders encroached upon the rights of other books. Heber  objected to this as Prosper Merimee objected to the gigantic English  hoopskirts of 1865,--there was space on Regent Street for but one  woman at a time.    Original as the Bibliotaph was in appearance, manners, habits, he was  less striking in what he did than in what he said. It is a pity that  no record of his talk exists. It is not surprising that there is no  such record, for his habits of wandering precluded the possibility of  his making a permanent impression. By the time people had fully  awakened to the significance of his presence among them he was gone.  So there grew up a legend concerning him, but no true biography. He  was like a comet, very shaggy and very brilliant, but he stayed so  brief a time in a place that it was impossible for one man to give  either the days or the thought to the reproduction of his more serious  and considered words. A greater difficulty was involved in the fact  that the Bibliotaph had many socii, but no fidus Achates. Moreover,  Achates, in this instance, would have needed the reportorial powers of  a James Boswell that he might properly interpret genius to the public.    This particular genius illustrated the misfortune of having too great  facility in establishing those relations which lie midway between  acquaintance and friendship. To put the matter in the form of a  paradox, he had so many _friends_ that he had no _friend_. Perhaps  this is unjust, but friendship has a touch of jealousy and  exclusiveness in it. He was too large-natured to say to one of his  admirers, 'Thou shalt have no other gods save myself;' but there were  those among the admirers who were quite prepared to say to him, 'We  prefer that thou shalt have no other worshipers in addition to us.'    People wondered that he seemed to have no care for a conventional home  life. He was taxed with want of sympathy with what makes even a humble  home a centre of light and happiness. He denied it, and said to his  accusers, 'Can you not understand that after a stay in _your_ home I  go away with much the feeling that must possess a lusty young calf  when his well-equipped mother tells him that henceforth he must find  means of sustenance elsewhere?'    He professed to have been once in love, but no one believed it. He  used to say that his most remarkable experience as a bachelor was in  noting the uniformity with which eligible young women passed him by on  the other side of the way. And when a married friend offered  condolence, with that sleek complacency of manner noteworthy in men  who are conscious of being mated for life better than they deserve,  the Bibliotaph said, with an admiring glance at the wife, 'Your  sympathy is supererogatory, sir, for I fully expect to become your  residuary legatee.'    It is most pleasing to think of this unique man 'buffeting his books'  in one of those temporary libraries which formed about him whenever he  stopped four or five weeks in a place. The shops were rifled of not a  few of their choicest possessions, and the spoils carried off to his  room. It was a joy to see him display his treasures, a delight to hear  him talk of them. He would disarm criticism with respect to the more  eccentric purchases by saying, 'You wouldn't approve of this, but _I_  thought it was curious,'--and then a torrent of facts, criticisms,  quotations, all bearing upon the particular volume which you were  supposed not to like; and so on, hour after hour. There was no limit  save that imposed by the receptive capacity of the guest. It reminded  one of the word spoken concerning a 'hard sitter at books' of the last  century, that he was a literary giant 'born to grapple with whole  libraries.' But the fine flavor of those hours spent in hearing him  discourse upon books and men is not to be recovered. It is evanescent,  spectral, now. This talk was like the improvisation of a musician who  is profoundly learned, but has in him a vein of poetry too. The talk  and the music strongly appeal to robust minds, and at the same time do  not repel the sentimentalist.    It is not to be supposed that the Bibliotaph pleased every one with  whom he came in contact. There were people whom his intellectual  potency affected in a disagreeable way. They accused him of applying  great mental force to inconsidered trifles. They said it was a  misfortune that so much talent was going to waste. But there is no  task so easy as criticising an able man's employment of his gifts.          THE BIBLIOTAPH: HIS FRIENDS, SCRAP-BOOKS, AND 'BINS'      To arrive at a high degree of pleasure in collecting a library, one  must travel. The Bibliotaph regularly traveled in search of his  volumes. His theory was that the collector must go to the book, not  wait for the book to come to him. No reputable sportsman, he said,  would wish the game brought alive to his back-yard for him to kill.  Half the pleasure was in tracking the quarry to its hiding-place. He  himself ordered but seldom from catalogues, and went regularly to and  fro among the dealers in books, seeking the volume which his heart  desired. He enjoyed those shops where the book-seller kept open house,  where the stock was large and surprises were common, where the  proprietor was prodigiously well-informed on some points and  correspondingly ill-informed on others. He bought freely, never  disputed a price, and laid down his cash with the air of a man who  believes that unspent money is the root of all evil.    These travels brought about three results: the making of friends, the  compilation of scrap-books, and the establishment of 'bins.' Before  speaking of any one of these points, a word on the satisfactions of  bibliographical touring.    In every town of considerable size, and in many towns of  inconsiderable size, are bookshops. It is a poor shop which does not  contain at least one good book. This book bides its time, and usually  outstays its welcome. But its fate is about its neck. Somewhere there  is a collector to whom that book is precious. They are made for one  another, the collector and the book; and it is astonishing how  infrequently they miss of realizing their mutual happiness. The  book-seller is a marriage-broker for unwedded books. His business is  to find them homes, and take a fee for so doing. Sugarman the Shadchan  was not more zealous than is your vendor of rare books.    Now, it is a curious fact that the most desirable of bookish treasures  are often found where one would be least likely to seek them. Montana  is a great State, nevertheless one does not think of going to Montana  for early editions of Shakespeare. Let the book-hunter inwardly digest  the following plain tale of a clergyman and a book of plays.    There is a certain collector who is sometimes called 'The Bishop.' He  is not a bishop, but he may be so designated; coming events have been  known to cast conspicuous shadows in the likeness of mitre and  crosier. The Bishop heard of a man in Montana who had an old book of  plays with an autograph of William Shakespeare pasted in it. Being a  wise ecclesiastic, he did not exclaim 'Tush' and 'Fie,' but proceeded  at once to go book-hunting in Montana. He went by proxy, if not in  person; the journey is long. In due time the owner of the volume was  found and the book was placed in the Bishop's hands for inspection. He  tore off the wrappers, and lo! it was a Fourth Folio of Shakespeare  excellently well preserved, and with what appeared to be the great  dramatist's signature written on a slip of paper and pasted inside the  front cover. The problem of the genuineness of that autograph does not  concern us. The great fact is that a Shakespeare folio turned up in  Montana. Now when he hears some one express desire for a copy of  Greene's _Groatsworth of Wit_, or any other rare book of Elizabeth's  time, the Bishop's thoughts fly toward the setting sun. Then he smiles  a notable kind of smile, and says, 'If I could get away I'd run out to  Montana and try to pick up a copy for you.'    There is a certain gentleman who loves the literature of Queen Anne's  reign. He lives with Whigs and Tories, vibrates "]]]
