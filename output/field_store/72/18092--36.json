No need to dwell on the character and  actions of the peoples, rulers and divines who have participated in, and  contributed to heighten the poignancy of the scenes of this, the greatest  drama in the world's spiritual history.            FEATURES OF THIS MOVING DRAMA      To enumerate a few of the outstanding features of this moving drama will  suffice to evoke in the reader of these pages, already familiar with the  history of the Faith, the memory of those vicissitudes which it has  experienced, and which the world has until now viewed with such frigid  indifference. The forced and sudden retirement of Baha'u'llah to the  mountains of Sulaymaniyyih, and the distressing consequences that flowed  from His two years' complete withdrawal; the incessant intrigues indulged  in by the exponents of _Sh_i'ih Islam in Najaf and Karbila, working in  close and constant association with their confederates in Persia; the  intensification of the repressive measures decreed by Sultan 'Abdu'l-'Aziz  which brought to a head the defection of certain prominent members of the  exiled community; the enforcement of yet another banishment by order of  that same Sultan, this time to that far off and most desolate of cities,  causing such despair as to lead two of the exiles to attempt suicide; the  unrelaxing surveillance to which they were subjected upon their arrival in  Akka, by hostile officials, and the insufferable imprisonment for two  years in the barracks of that town; the interrogatory to which the Turkish  pa_sh_a subsequently subjected his Prisoner at the headquarters of the  government; His confinement for no less than eight years in a humble  dwelling surrounded by the befouled air of that city, His sole recreation  being confined to pacing the narrow space of His room--these, as well as  other tribulations, proclaim, on the one hand, the nature of the ordeal  and the indignities He suffered, and point, on the other, the finger of  accusation at those mighty ones of the earth who had either so sorely  maltreated Him, or deliberately withheld from Him their succor.    No wonder that from the Pen of Him Who bore this anguish with such sublime  patience these words should have been revealed: \"He Who is the Lord of the  seen and unseen is now manifest unto all men. His blessed Self hath been  afflicted with such harm that if all the seas, visible and invisible, were  turned into ink, and all that dwell in the kingdom into pens, and all that  are in the heavens and all that are on earth into scribes, they would, of  a certainty, be powerless to record it.\" And again: \"I have been, most of  the days of My life, even as a slave, sitting under a sword hanging on a  thread, knowing not whether it would fall soon or late upon him.\" \"All  this generation,\" He affirms, \"could offer Us were wounds from its darts,  and the only cup it proffered to Our lips was the cup of its venom. On Our  neck We still bear the scar of chains, and upon Our body are imprinted the  evidences of an unyielding cruelty.\" \"Twenty years have passed, O kings!\"  He, addressing the kings of Christendom, at the height of His mission, has  written, \"during which We have, each day, tasted the agony of a fresh  tribulation. No one of them that were before Us hath endured the things We  have endured. Would that ye could perceive it! They that rose up against  Us have put Us to death, have shed Our blood, have plundered Our property,  and violated Our honor. Though aware of most of Our afflictions, ye,  nevertheless, have failed to stay the hand of the aggressor. For is it not  your clear duty to restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal  equitably with your subjects, that your high sense of justice may be fully  demonstrated to all mankind?\"    Who is the ruler, may it not be confidently asked, whether of the East or  of the West, who, at any time since the dawn of so transcendent a  Revelation, has been prompted to raise his voice either in its praise or  against those who persecuted it? Which people has, in the course of so  long a captivity, felt urged to arise and stem the tide of such  tribulations? Who is the sovereign, excepting a single woman, shining in  solitary glory, who has, in however small a measure, felt impelled to  respond to the poignant call of Baha'u'llah? Who amongst the great ones of  the earth was inclined to extend this infant Faith of God the benefit of  his recognition or support? Which one of the multitudes of creeds, sects,  races, parties and classes and of the highly diversified schools of human  thought, considered it necessary to direct its gaze towards the rising  light of the Faith, to contemplate its unfolding system, to ponder its  hidden processes, to appraise its weighty message, to acknowledge its  regenerative power, to embrace its salutary truth, or to proclaim its  eternal verities? Who among the worldly wise and the so-called men of  insight and wisdom can justly claim, after the lapse of nearly a century,  to have disinterestedly approached its theme, to have considered  impartially its claims, to have taken sufficient pains to delve into its  literature, to have assiduously striven to separate facts from fiction, or  to have accorded its cause the treatment it merits? Where are the  preeminent exponents, whether of the arts or sciences, with the exception  of a few isolated cases, who have lifted a finger, or whispered a word of  commendation, in either the defense or the praise of a Faith that has  conferred upon the world so priceless a benefit, that has suffered so long  and so grievously, and which enshrines within its shell so enthralling a  promise for a world so woefully battered, so manifestly bankrupt?    To the mounting tide of trials which laid low the Bab, to the  long-drawn-out calamities which rained on Baha'u'llah, to the warnings  sounded by both the Herald and the Author of the Baha'i Revelation, must  be added the sufferings which, for no less than seventy years, were  endured by 'Abdu'l-Baha, as well as His pleas, and entreaties, uttered in  the evening of His life, in connection with the dangers that increasingly  threatened the whole of mankind. Born in the very year that witnessed the  inception of the Babi Revelation; baptized with the initial fires of  persecution that raged around that nascent Cause; an eyewitness, when a  boy of eight, of the violent upheavals that rocked the Faith which His  Father had espoused; sharing with Him, the ignominy, the perils, and  rigors consequent upon the successive banishments from His native-land to  countries far beyond its confines; arrested and forced to support, in a  dark cell, the indignity of imprisonment soon after His arrival in Akka;  the object of repeated investigations and the target of continual assaults  and insults under the despotic rule of Sultan 'Abdu'l-Hamid, and later  under the ruthless military dictatorship of the suspicious and merciless  Jamal Pa_sh_a--He, too, the Center and Pivot of Baha'u'llah's peerless  Covenant and the perfect Exemplar of His teachings, was made to taste, at  the hands of potentates, ecclesiastics, governments and peoples, the cup  of woe which the Bab and Baha'u'llah, as well as so many of their  followers, had drained.    With the warnings which both His pen and voice have given in countless  Tablets and discourses, during an almost lifelong incarceration and in the  course of His extended travels in both the European and American  continents, they who labor for the spread of His Father's Faith in the  Western world are sufficiently acquainted. How often and how passionately  did He appeal to those in authority and to the public at large to examine  dispassionately the precepts enunciated by His Father? With what precision  and emphasis He unfolded the system of the Faith He was expounding,  elucidated its fundamental verities, stressed its distinguishing features,  and proclaimed the redemptive character of its principles? How insistently  did He foreshadow the impending chaos, the approaching upheavals, the  universal conflagration which, in the concluding years of His life, had  only begun to reveal the measure of its force and the significance of its  impact on human society?    A co-sharer in the woeful trials and momentary frustrations afflicting the  Bab and Baha'u'llah; reaping a harvest in His lifetime wholly  incommensurate to the sublime, the incessant and strenuous efforts He had  exerted; experiencing the initial perturbations of the world-shaking  catastrophe in store for an unbelieving humanity; bent with age, and with  eyes dimmed by the gathering storm which the reception accorded by a  faithless generation to His Father's Cause was raising, and with a heart  bleeding over the immediate destiny of God's wayward children--He, at last,  sank beneath a weight of troubles for which they who had imposed them upon  Him, and upon those gone before Him, were soon to be summoned to a dire  reckoning.    \"Hasten, O my God!\" He cried, at a time when adversity had sore beset Him,  \"the days of my ascension unto Thee, and of my coming before Thee, and of  my entry into Thy presence, that I may be delivered from the darkness of  the cruelty inflicted by them upon me, and may enter the luminous  atmosphere of Thy nearness, O my Lord, the All-Glorious, and may rest  under the shadow of Thy most great mercy.\" \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha [O Thou the  Glory of Glories]!\" He wrote in a Tablet revealed during the last week of  His life, \"I have renounced the world and the people thereof, and am  heartbroken and sorely afflicted because of the unfaithful. In the cage of  this world I flutter even as a frightened bird, and yearn every day to  take my flight unto Thy Kingdom. Ya Baha'u'l-Abha! Make me to drink of the  cup of sacrifice, and set me free. Relieve me from these woes and trials,  from these afflictions "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#4)"],[1," ears to the Voice of  Truth and shut his eyes to the Sacred Light, neglecting the Law of God,  for this reason has the darkness of war and tumult, unrest and misery,  desolated the earth. I pray that you will all strive to bring each child  of God into the radiance of the Sun of Truth, that the darkness may be  dissipated by the penetrating rays of its glory, and the winter's hardness  and cold may be melted away by the merciful warmth of its shining.          THE LIGHT OF TRUTH IS NOW SHINING UPON THE EAST AND WEST      Monday, October 23rd    When a man has found the joy of life in one place, he returns to that same  spot to find more joy. When a man has found gold in a mine, he returns  again to that mine to dig for more gold.    This shows the internal force and natural instinct which God has given to  man, and the power of vital energy which is born in him.    The West has always received spiritual enlightenment from the East. The  Song of the Kingdom is first heard in the East, but in the West the  greater volume of sound bursts upon the listening ears.    The Lord Christ arose as a bright Star in the Eastern sky, but the light  of His Teaching shone more perfectly in the West, where His influence has  taken root more firmly and His Cause has spread to a greater degree than  in the land of His birth.    The sound of the Song of Christ has echoed over all the lands of the  Western World and entered the hearts of its people.    The people of the West are firm, and the foundations on which they build  are of rock; they are steadfast, and do not easily forget.    The West is like a strong sturdy plant; when the rain falls gently upon it  to give it nourishment and the sun shines upon it, then does it blossom in  due time and bring forth good fruit. It is a long time since the Sun of  Truth mirrored forth by the Lord Christ has shed its radiance upon the  West, for the Face of God has been veiled by the sin and forgetfulness of  man. But now again, praise be to God, the Holy Spirit speaks anew to the  world! The constellation of love and wisdom and power is once more shining  from the Divine Horizon to give joy to all who turn their faces to the  Light of God. Baha'u'llah has rent the veil of prejudice and superstition  which was stifling the souls of men. Let us pray to God that the breath of  the Holy Spirit may again give hope and refreshment to the people,  awakening in them a desire to do the Will of God. May heart and soul be  vivified in every man: so will they all rejoice in a new birth.    Then shall humanity put on a new garment in the radiance of the love of  God, and it shall be the dawn of a new creation! Then will the Mercy of  the Most Merciful be showered upon all mankind and they will arise to a  new life.    My earnest desire is that you will all strive and work for this glorious  end; that you will be faithful and loving workers in the building of the  new spiritual civilization; the elect of God, in willing joyful obedience  carrying out His supreme design! Success is truly near at hand, for the  Flag of Divinity has been raised aloft, and the Sun of the Righteousness  of God appeareth upon the horizon in the sight of all men!          THE UNIVERSAL LOVE      October 24th    An Indian said to 'Abdu'l-Baha:    'My aim in life is to transmit as far as in me lies the message of Krishna  to the world.'    'Abdu'l-Baha said: The Message of Krishna is the message of love. All  God's prophets have brought the message of love. None has ever thought  that war and hate are good. Every one agrees in saying that love and  kindness are best.    Love manifests its reality in deeds, not only in words--these alone are  without effect. In order that love may manifest its power there must be an  object, an instrument, a motive.    There are many ways of expressing the love principle; there is love for  the family, for the country, for the race, there is political enthusiasm,  there is also the love of community of interest in service. These are all  ways and means of showing the power of love. Without any such means, love  would be unseen, unheard, unfelt--altogether unexpressed, unmanifested!  Water shows its power in various ways, in quenching thirst, causing seed  to grow, etc. Coal expresses one of its principles in gas-light, while one  of the powers of electricity is shown in the electric light. If there were  neither gas nor electricity, the nights of the world would be darkness!  So, it is necessary to have an instrument, a motive for love's  manifestation, an object, a mode of expression.    We must find a way of spreading love among the sons of humanity.    Love is unlimited, boundless, infinite! Material things are limited,  circumscribed, finite. You cannot adequately express infinite love by  limited means.    The perfect love needs an unselfish instrument, absolutely freed from  fetters of every kind. The love of family is limited; the tie of blood  relationship is not the strongest bond. Frequently members of the same  family disagree, and even hate each other.    Patriotic love is finite; the love of one's country causing hatred of all  others, is not perfect love! Compatriots also are not free from quarrels  amongst themselves.    The love of race is limited; there is some union here, but that is  insufficient. Love must be free from boundaries!    To love our own race may mean hatred of all others, and even people of the  same race often dislike each other.    Political love also is much bound up with hatred of one party for another;  this love is very limited and uncertain.    The love of community of interest in service is likewise fluctuating;  frequently competitions arise, which lead to jealousy, and at length  hatred replaces love.    A few years ago, Turkey and Italy had a friendly political understanding;  now they are at war!    All these ties of love are imperfect. It is clear that limited material  ties are insufficient to adequately express the universal love.    The great unselfish love for humanity is bounded by none of these  imperfect, semi-selfish bonds; this is the one perfect love, possible to  all mankind, and can only be achieved by the power of the Divine Spirit.  No worldly power can accomplish the universal love.    Let all be united in this Divine power of love! Let all strive to grow in  the light of the Sun of Truth, and reflecting this luminous love on all  men, may their hearts become so united that they may dwell evermore in the  radiance of the limitless love.    Remember these words which I speak unto you during the short time I am  amongst you in Paris. I earnestly exhort you: let not your hearts be  fettered by the material things of this world; I charge you not to lie  contentedly on the beds of negligence, prisoners of matter, but to arise  and free yourselves from its chains!    The animal creation is captive to matter, God has given freedom to man.  The animal cannot escape the law of nature, whereas man may control it,  for he, containing nature, can rise above it.    The power of the Holy Spirit, enlightening man's intelligence, has enabled  him to discover means of bending many natural laws to his will. He flies  through the air, floats on the sea, and even moves under the waters.    All this proves how man's intelligence has been enabled to free him from  the limitations of nature, and to solve many of her mysteries. Man, to a  certain extent, has broken the chains of matter.    The Holy Spirit will give to man greater powers than these, if only he  will strive after the things of the spirit and endeavour to attune his  heart to the Divine infinite love.    When you love a member of your family or a compatriot, let it be with a  ray of the Infinite Love! Let it be in God, and for God! Wherever you find  the attributes of God love that person, whether he be of your family or of  another. Shed the light of a boundless love on every human being whom you  meet, whether of your country, your race, your political party, or of any  other nation, colour or shade of political opinion. Heaven will support  you while you work in this in-gathering of the scattered peoples of the  world beneath the shadow of the almighty tent of unity.    You will be servants of God, who are dwelling near to Him, His divine  helpers in the service, ministering to all Humanity. All Humanity! Every  human being! never forget this!    Do not say, he is an Italian, or a Frenchman, or an American, or an  Englishman, remember only that he is a son of God, a servant of the Most  High, a man! All are men! Forget nationalities; all are equal in the sight  of God!    Remember not your own limitations; the help of God will come to you.  Forget yourself. God's help will surely come!    When you call on the Mercy of God waiting to reinforce you, your strength  will be tenfold.    Look at me: I am so feeble, yet I have had the strength given me to come  amongst you: a poor servant of God, who has been enabled to give you this  message! I shall not be with you long! One must never consider one's own  feebleness, it is the strength of the Holy Spirit of Love, which gives the  power to teach. The thought of our own weakness could only bring despair.  We must look higher than all earthly thoughts; detach ourselves from every  material idea, crave for the things of the spirit; fix our eyes on the  everlasting bountiful Mercy of the Almighty, who will fill our souls with  the gladness of joyful service to His command 'Love One Another'.          THE IMPRISONMENT OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA      4 Avenue de Camoeens,  Wednesday, October 25th    I regret much that I have kept you waiting this morning, but I have so  much to do in a short time for the Cause of the love of God.    You will not mind having waited a little to see me. I have waited years  and years in prison, that I might come to see you now.    Above all, God be praised, our hearts are always in unison, and with one  aim are drawn to the love of "]]]
