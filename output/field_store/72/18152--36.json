The bombardment continued all the afternoon, and ceased only when  darkness fell.    That night, when the van Warmelos returned to their deserted home,  they found the house still standing and no trace of the bombardment  except pieces of shell lying in the garden.    They were much surprised a few hours later, by the return of their two  warriors, weary and desperate after a hopeless attempt to keep back  the English with a handful of burghers, and the news they brought was  to the effect that Pretoria was to be surrendered to the enemy the  next morning. Once more they expressed their determination to escape  to the Boer lines, wherever they might be.    Only a few hours' rest for them that night and then they rode away at  dawn, in the Middelburg direction, on that dark and dreadful June 5th.    It was Fritz's twenty-second birthday on that cruel mid-winter's morn,  and when Hansie saw him again he was a man of twenty-six, with the  experiences and suffering of a lifetime resting on his shoulders.    The fate of the two young men remained a mystery to their dear ones  for many months of agonising suspense, and they pass out of these  pages for a time while we turn our attention to the relation of events  within the capital.          CHAPTER II    HOW THE MINES WERE SAVED      Before we begin relating the events with which this book is actually  concerned, and which took place, as we have said in the previous  chapter, exclusively in and around the capital, I must ask my reader  to turn his attention for a few moments to that great mining centre,  Johannesburg, \"The Golden City\" of South Africa.    If it was hated by the Boers before the war as the cause of all the  unrest in their beloved country, the unwelcome revolution in the calm  simplicity of their hitherto peaceful life, it is not to be wondered  at that their hatred and resentment had been intensified by the way in  which the war was brought about.    This feeling had risen to its height of concentrated fury when it  became known to the burghers that the sweeping advance of the British  forces in overwhelming numbers would soon make it possible for the  English to take full possession of those coveted mines.    At the time of the Republican successes there had been no suggestion  that it would be politic to destroy the mines, but as reverses became  more frequent, and it became evident beyond a doubt that the British  troops were about to cross the Vaal, a strong section of the  Government, supported by popular feeling, openly advocated the  destruction of the mines as well as the town of Johannesburg. The  precedent quoted for such a course was the burning of Moscow by the  Russians, in order to retard the victorious advance of Napoleon.    Very soon it became apparent that the members of the Government who  were advocating this policy were gaining the upper hand, as  instructions were actually given to certain officials of the Mines  Department to make the necessary arrangements for blowing up the  mines. Another section of the Government, among whom were General  Louis Botha and Dr. F.E.T. Krause, strenuously opposed the carrying  out of this policy.    This section eventually gained the upper hand at the time when  Commandant Schutte was compelled to relinquish the position of Special  Commandant for the Rand, and Dr. Krause was appointed in his stead,  although the circumstances leading to this change had at first in some  measure strengthened those who advocated destroying the mines. The  change was brought about in consequence of the terrible explosion at  Begbie's Engineering Works, which had been converted into a bomb  factory by the Government, and where several persons were killed and  many injured.    The cause of this explosion after investigation was alleged to have  been the work of British spies, and it was only natural that those  persons advocating the destruction of the mines should avail  themselves of this circumstance to further their scheme, but the bold  and determined opposition of Dr. Krause, supported as he was by the  mines police, a special body of men organised for the purpose of  protecting the mines, had the effect of inducing the \"Destroyers\" to  mature their scheme in secret.    The probable fate of the mines was openly and freely discussed in the  capital, and I have a faint recollection of a debating society having  taken for its subject, at this time, the question, \"Would the result  of blowing up the mines be beneficial or detrimental to the Boer  cause?\" Many were the pros and cons, and what conclusion was arrived  at I do not know.    At Harmony, mother and daughter followed the subject with the keenest  interest and anxiety, realising the important effect which the  destruction of the mines would have on the later development of the  war.    There were several weighty considerations which the \"Destroyers,\" in  their thirst for revenge, seemed to have overlooked entirely.    In the first place, the blowing up of the mines would have failed in  its object of punishing the mining magnates against whom the  resentment of the Republicans was specially directed, and the chief  sufferers would be innocent shareholders in every part of the world,  members of the middle-classes who had invested their little all in the  fabulously rich gold mines of the Rand. Another very important  consideration which was discussed by the more thoughtful section of  the community was the probable destruction of the farms by the British  forces by way of retaliation for the fate of the mines. Could the  burghers have foreseen that the entire country would be laid waste in  any case as the war proceeded, nothing could have saved the mines. But  the devastation of Boer homesteads was not to begin until a much later  period, and to this fact the \"Destroyers\" no doubt owed the  frustration of their schemes.    I have to thank friends who were principally concerned in the matter  for the following account of how the mines were saved and for the  interesting description of the surrender of the Golden City, appearing  in Chapter III.           *       *       *       *       *    At this time the British troops were advancing rapidly. The Boers were  panic-stricken, and had it not been for the determined efforts of the  administration in Johannesburg, chaos would have resulted.    About ten days before the surrender of the town, the scheme of the  \"Destroyers\" was unwittingly disclosed through the foolishness of the  man who had been apparently chosen to carry it out. Judge Kock, who  was a friend of Dr. Krause's, came over to Johannesburg for the  purpose of making a last and determined effort to destroy the mines.  Being a great friend of the Krauses, he was invited to stay at their  house. In a burst of confidence he produced a letter signed by a very  high-placed official of the Executive Council, whereby he was  empowered, in indefinite terms, to call for the co-operation of any  military official whom he pleased. He showed Dr. Krause this letter  and requested him to instruct the mine police and certain other mine  officials to assist him. He was met with a blank refusal, and a threat  that if he persisted in this undertaking he would be arrested. Judge  Kock, or, as he then styled himself, \"General\" Kock, had gathered  together a cosmopolitan force of about 100 men.    About this time events were rapidly changing. The determined advance  of the British forces and the panic-stricken retreat of the Boers had  the effect of encouraging \"General\" Kock and his men. Dr. Krause's  hands were full in attending to the military necessities of the  situation. Urgent messages from Botha and the President were hourly  passing over the wires. General French, who was advancing on  Johannesburg from the east, had pressed forward to such an extent that  the Boers retreating from Vereeniging were practically hemmed in by  the British columns.    Commandant Krause on the Sunday afternoon hastily gathered as many  fighting men as he could muster, and with them occupied the hills  surrounding Van Wyk's Rust, in order to check the advance of French  and give the Boers an opportunity of retreating safely. On the Monday,  while fighting was going on, he was obliged to leave his men--who by  that time had been reinforced by the retreating Boers--for  Johannesburg, on receiving an urgent message that chaos was reigning  in town, and that the goods sheds at the station, where Government  provisions and food-stuffs were stored, were being looted. On his  return order was speedily restored.    Tuesday, May 29th, was the eventful day in the history of the saving  of the mines, as on this date Dr. Krause personally arrested \"General\"  Kock and dispersed his band of followers. It happened in this way.    During the progress of the war the Government had been working some of  the mines, and, at the time of the rapid advance of the British from  Bloemfontein, instructions were given that all the gold should be  conveyed to Pretoria. The week before the surrender of Johannesburg,  Dr. Krause had given the necessary instructions for doing this, and  had received a report that all gold had been transported. Now, it  appears that Kock had taken advantage of the Commandant's absence from  Johannesburg to further his scheme of destruction, and the first mine  he went to with that purpose in view was the Robinson. On arriving  there he accidentally discovered that about 120,000 ounces of gold,  valued at about L400,000, were still stored on the mine. He was  evidently so perturbed about this that he momentarily forgot his  purpose, and galloped post-haste with the greater number of his men to  the Commandant's office. His men were drawn up outside; he dismounted  and found Dr. Krause in consultation with Commandant L.E. van  Diggelen, the energetic officer in command of the Mines Police."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20195"],[0,"Wood-Block Printing (#4)"],[1,"(as described later in Chapter  V) ready for the next impression, which may be proceeded with at once  without fear of the colour running. It is a remarkable fact that patches  of wet colour which touch one another do not run if properly printed.    For the second printing fresh colour is prepared and clean paste, and  the printing proceeds as already described, care being taken to watch  the proper registering or fitting of each impression to its place in the  design.    There are many niceties and details to be observed in the printing of  both line and colour blocks. These are given in special chapters  following. This description of the main action of printing will be of  use in giving a general idea of the final operation before the details  of the preliminary stages are described.          CHAPTER III           Description of the Materials and Tools required for Block-cutting    The wood most commonly used by the Japanese for their printing-blocks is  a cherry wood very similar to that grown in England. The Canadian cherry  wood, which is more easily obtained than English cherry, is of too open  a grain to be of use. The more slowly grown English wood has a closer  grain and is the best for all the purposes of block cutting and  printing. Well-seasoned planks should be obtained and kept ready for  cutting up as may be required.    When a set of blocks is to be cut for a given design, the size of the  printing surface of each block should be made equal to the size of the  design plus 1 inch or, for large prints, 1-1/2 inch in addition long  ways, and 1/4 or 1/2 inch crossways. The thickness of the plank need not  be more than 5/8 or 3/4 inch. It is best for the protection of the  surfaces of the printing blocks and to prevent warping, also for  convenience in storing and handling them, to fix across each end a piece  of wood slightly thicker than the plank itself. These cross-ends should  be mounted as shown in fig. 2.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Block mounted with cross ends to  prevent warping.]    Both surfaces of the plank should be planed smooth and then finished  with a steel scraper, but not touched with sand-paper.    It is understood that the face of the plank is used for the printing  surface, and not the end of the grain as in blocks for modern wood  engraving.    The tools needed for cutting the blocks are the following:    1. THE KNIFE    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Drawing of the knife.]    With this knife the most important and delicate work is done. All the  lines of the key-block as well as the boundaries of the colour masses  are cut with it, before the removal of intervening spaces.    The blade lies in a slot and is held tight by the tapered ferrule. This  can be pulled off by hand and the blade lengthened by pulling it  forward in the slot.    2. CHISELS    These are used for removing the wood between the cut lines or colour  masses, and should be ordinary carvers' chisels of the following sizes:    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Sizes of chisels.]    except those under No. 9, which are short-handled chisels for small  work.    The Japanese toolmakers fit these small chisels into a split handle as  shown in fig. 5. The blade is held tightly in its place by the tapered  ferrule when the handle is closed, or can be lengthened by opening the  handle and pulling forward the blade in its slot. In this way the blade  can be used down to its last inch.    3. MALLET    This is needed for driving the larger chisels.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Short chisel in split handle.]    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Mallet.]    These are all the tools that are needed for block cutting. For keeping  them in order it is well to have oilstones of three grades:    1. A carborundum stone for rapidly re-covering the shape of a chipped  or blunt tool.    2. A good ordinary oil stone.    3. A hard stone for keeping a fine edge on the knife in cutting line  blocks. The American \"Washita\" stone is good for this purpose.    [Illustration: Plate IV. Colour block of a print of which the key-block  is shown on page 5.]    (_To face page 23._)          CHAPTER IV           Block Cutting and the Planning of Blocks      The cutting of a line block needs patience and care and skill, but it is  not the most difficult part of print making, nor is it so hopeless an  enterprise as it seems at first to one who has not tried to use the  block-cutter's knife.    In Japan this work is a highly specialised craft, never undertaken by  the artist himself, but carried out by skilled craftsmen who only do  this part of the work of making colour prints. Even the clearing of the  spaces between the cut lines is done by assistant craftsmen or  craftswomen.    The exquisite perfection of the cutting of the lines in the finest of  the Japanese prints, as, for instance, the profile of a face in a  design by Outamaro, has required the special training and tradition of  generations of craftsmen.    The knife, however, is not a difficult weapon to an artist who has hands  and a trained sense of form. In carrying out his own work, moreover, he  may express a quality that is of greater value even than technical  perfection.    At present we have no craftsmen ready for this work--nor could our  designs be safely trusted to the interpretation of Japanese  block-cutters. Until we train craftsmen among ourselves we must  therefore continue to cut our own blocks.      CUTTING    A set of blocks consists of a key-block and several colour blocks. The  block that must be cut first is that which prints the line or \"key\" of  the design. By means of impressions from this key-block the various  other blocks for printing the coloured portions of the design are cut.  The key-block is the most important of the set of blocks and contains  the essential part of the design.    A drawing of that part of the design which is to be cut on the key-block  should first be made. This is done on the thinnest of Japanese tissue  paper in black indelible ink. The drawing is then pasted face downward  on the prepared first block with good starch paste. It is best to lay  the drawing flat on its back upon a pad of a few sheets of paper of  about the same size, and to rub the paste on the surface of the block,  not on the paper. The block is now laid down firmly with its pasted side  on the drawing, which at once adheres to the block. Next turn the block  over and lay a dry sheet of paper over the damp drawing so as to protect  it, and with the baren, or printing rubber, rub the drawing flat, and  well on to the block all over.    The drawing should then be allowed to dry thoroughly on the block.    With regard to the design of the key block, it is a common mistake to  treat this as a drawing only of outlines of the forms of the print. Much  modern so-called decorative printing has been weak in this respect. A  flat, characterless line, with no more expression than a bent gaspipe,  is often printed round the forms of a design, followed by printings of  flat colour, the whole resulting in a travesty of \"flat\" decorative  treatment.    The key design should be a skeleton of all the forms of a print,  expressing much more than mere exterior boundaries. It may so suggest  form that although the colour be printed by a flat tint the result is  not flat. When one is unconscious of any flatness in the final effect,  though the result is obtained by flat printing, then the proper use of  flat treatment has been made. The affectation of flatness in inferior  colour printing and poster work is due to a misapprehension of the true  principle of flat treatment.    [Illustration: Plate V. Impression (nearly actual size) of a portion of  a Japanese wood block showing great variety in the character of the  lines and spots suggesting form.]    (_To face page 26._)    As an illustration of the great variety of form that may be expressed by  the key-block, a reproduction is given (page 33) of an impression from a  Japanese key-block. It will be seen that the lines and spots express  much more than boundaries of form. In the case of the lighter tree  foliage the boundaries are left to be determined entirely by the  subsequent colour blocks, and only the interior form or character of the  foliage is suggested. The quality or kind of line, too, varies with the  thing expressed, whether tree, rock, sea, or the little ship. The  design, too, is in itself beautiful and gives the essential form of the  entire print.    The study of the drawing of any of the key-blocks of the Japanese  masters will reveal their wonderful power and resource in the suggestion  of essential form by black lines, spots, and masses of one uniform tint  of black or grey. The development of this kind of expressive drawing is  most important to the designer of printed decoration, whether by wood  blocks, or lithography, or any other printing process.    Other good types of drawing for the purposes of key-blocks in wood are  given on Plate V facing page 26 and Plate XVI p. iii in Appendix.    When the key-block with its design pasted upon it is thoroughly dry, a  little sweet oil should be rubbed with the finger at that part where the  cutting is to begin, so as to make the paper transparent and the black  line quite clear.    In order to keep the block from moving on the work-table, there should  be fixed one or two strips of wood screwed down, to act as stops in case  the block tends to slip, but the block should lie freely on the table,  so that it may be easily turned round during the cutting when necessary.  One should, however, learn to use the cutting knife in all directions,  and to move the block as little as possible.    The knife is held and guided by the right hand, but is pushed along by  the middle finger of the left hand placed at the back of the blade,  close down near the point. The left hand should be generally flat on the  work-table, palm down, and the nail of the middle finger must be kept  short. This position is shown (f"]]]
