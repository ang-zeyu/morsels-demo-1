The answer is obvious: Those great masters who have  travelled the same road with success are the most likely to conduct  others.  The works of those who have stood the test of ages have a claim  to that respect and veneration to which no modern can pretend.  The  duration and stability of their fame is sufficient to evince that it has  not been suspended upon the slender thread of fashion and caprice, but  bound to the human heart by every tie of sympathetic approbation.    There is no danger of studying too much the works of those great men, but  how they may be studied to advantage is an inquiry of great importance.    Some who have never raised their minds to the consideration of the real  dignity of the art, and who rate the works of an artist in proportion as  they excel, or are defective in the mechanical parts, look on theory as  something that may enable them to talk but not to paint better, and  confining themselves entirely to mechanical practice, very assiduously  toil on in the drudgery of copying, and think they make a rapid progress  while they faithfully exhibit the minutest part of a favourite picture.  This appears to me a very tedious, and I think a very erroneous, method  of proceeding.  Of every large composition, even of those which are most  admired, a great part may be truly said to be common-place.  This, though  it takes up much time in copying, conduces little to improvement.  I  consider general copying as a delusive kind of industry; the student  satisfies himself with the appearance of doing something; he falls into  the dangerous habit of imitating without selecting, and of labouring  without any determinate object; as it requires no effort of the mind, he  sleeps over his work; and those powers of invention and composition which  ought particularly to be called out and put in action lie torpid, and  lose their energy for want of exercise.    It is an observation that all must have made, how incapable those are of  producing anything of their own who have spent much of their time in  making finished copies.    To suppose that the complication of powers, and variety of ideas  necessary to that mind which aspires to the first honours ill the art of  painting, can be obtained by the frigid contemplation of a few single  models, is no less absurd than it would be in him who wishes to be a poet  to imagine that by translating a tragedy he can acquire to himself  sufficient knowledge of the appearances of nature, the operations of the  passions, and the incidents of life.    The great use in copying, if it be at all useful, should seem to be in  learning to colour; yet even colouring will never be perfectly attained  by servilely copying the mould before you.  An eye critically nice can  only be formed by observing well-coloured pictures with attention: and by  close inspection, and minute examination you will discover, at last, the  manner of handling, the artifices of contrast, glazing, and other  expedients, by which good colourists have raised the value of their  tints, and by which nature has been so happily imitated.    I must inform you, however, that old pictures deservedly celebrated for  their colouring are often so changed by dirt and varnish, that we ought  not to wonder if they do not appear equal to their reputation in the eyes  of unexperienced painters, or young students.  An artist whose judgment  is matured by long observation, considers rather what the picture once  was, than what it is at present.  He has acquired a power by habit of  seeing the brilliancy of tints through the cloud by which it is obscured.  An exact imitation, therefore, of those pictures, is likely to fill the  student's mind with false opinions, and to send him back a colourist of  his own formation, with ideas equally remote from nature and from art,  from the genuine practice of the masters and the real appearances of  things.    Following these rules, and using these precautions, when you have clearly  and distinctly learned in what good colouring consists, you cannot do  better than have recourse to nature herself, who is always at hand, and  in comparison of whose true splendour the best coloured pictures are but  faint and feeble.    However, as the practice of copying is not entirely to be excluded, since  the mechanical practice of painting is learned in some measure by it, let  those choice parts only be selected which have recommended the work to  notice.  If its excellence consists in its general effect, it would be  proper to make slight sketches of the machinery and general management of  the picture.  Those sketches should be kept always by you for the  regulation of your style.  Instead of copying the touches of those great  masters, copy only their conceptions.  Instead of treading in their  footsteps, endeavour only to keep the same road.  Labour to invent on  their general principles and way of thinking.  Possess yourself with  their spirit.  Consider with yourself how a Michael Angelo or a Raffaelle  would have treated this subject: and work yourself into a belief that  your picture is to be seen and criticised by them when completed.  Even  an attempt of this kind will rouse your powers.    But as mere enthusiasm will carry you but a little way, let me recommend  a practice that may be equivalent, and will perhaps more efficaciously  contribute to your advancement, than even the verbal corrections of those  masters themselves, could they be obtained.  What I would propose is,  that you should enter into a kind of competition, by painting a similar  subject, and making a companion to any picture that you consider as a  model.  After you have finished your work, place it near the model, and  compare them carefully together.  You will then not only see, but feel  your own deficiencies more sensibly than by precepts, or any other means  of instruction.  The true principles of painting will mingle with your  thoughts.  Ideas thus fixed by sensible objects, will be certain and  definitive; and sinking deep into the mind, will not only be more just,  but more lasting than those presented to you by precepts only: which  will, always be fleeting, variable, and undetermined.    This method of comparing your own efforts with those of some great  master, is indeed a severe and mortifying task, to which none will  submit, but such as have great views, with fortitude sufficient to forego  the gratifications of present vanity for future honour.  When the student  has succeeded in some measure to his own satisfaction, and has  felicitated himself on his success, to go voluntarily to a tribunal where  he knows his vanity must be humbled, and all self-approbation must  vanish, requires not only great resolution, but great humility.  To him,  however, who has the Ambition to be a real master, the solid satisfaction  which proceeds from a consciousness of his advancement (of which seeing  his own faults is the first step) will very abundantly compensate for the  mortification of present disappointment.  There is, besides, this  alleviating circumstance.  Every discovery he makes, every acquisition of  knowledge he attains, seems to proceed from his own sagacity; and thus he  acquires a confidence in himself sufficient to keep up the resolution of  perseverance.    We all must have experienced how lazily, and consequently how  ineffectually, instruction is received when forced upon the mind by  others.  Few have been taught to any purpose who have not been their own  teachers.  We prefer those instructions which we have given ourselves,  from our affection to the instructor; and they are more effectual, from  being received into the mind at the very time when it is most open and  eager to receive them.    With respect to the pictures that you are to choose for your models, I  could wish that you would take the world's opinion rather than your own.  In other words, I would have you choose those of established reputation  rather than follow your own fancy.  If you should not admire them at  first, you will, by endeavouring to imitate them, find that the world has  not been mistaken.    It is not an easy task to point out those various excellences for your  imitation which he distributed amongst the various schools.  An endeavour  to do this may perhaps be the subject of some future discourse.  I will,  therefore, at present only recommend a model for style in painting, which  is a branch of the art more immediately necessary to the young student.  Style in painting is the same as in writing, a power over materials,  whether words or colours, by which conceptions or sentiments are  conveyed.  And in this Lodovico Carrache (I mean in his best works)  appears to me to approach the nearest to perfection.  His unaffected  breadth of light and shadow, the simplicity of colouring, which holding  its proper rank, does not draw aside the least part of the attention from  the subject, and the solemn effect of that twilight which seems diffused  over his pictures, appear to me to correspond with grave and dignified  subjects, better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine which  enlightens the pictures of Titian.  Though Tintoret thought that Titian's  colouring was the model of perfection, and would correspond even with the  sublime of Michael Angelo; and that if Angelo had coloured like Titian,  or Titian designed like Angelo, the world would once have had a perfect  painter.    It is our misfortune, however, that those works of Carrache which I would  recommend to the student are not often found out of Bologna.  The \"St.  Francis in the midst of his Friars,\" \"The Transfiguration,\" \"The Birth of  St. John the Baptist,\" \"The Calling of St. Matthew,\" the \"St. Jerome,\"  the fresco paintings in the Zampieri Palace, are all worthy the attention  of the student.  And I think those who travel would do well to allot a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21781"],[0,"Text Book of Biology, Part 1: Vertebrata (#4)"],[1,"stuffs, containing  either carbon together with hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of  H2O (the carbo-hydrates), or carbon and hydrogen without oxygen  (the hydrocarbons). The second division consists of the nitrogenous  materials, containing also carbon, hydrogen, a certain amount  of oxygen, sulphur, and possibly other elements. Among the  carbohydrates, the commonest are starch and cellulose, which are  insoluble bodies, and sugar, which is soluble. The hydrocarbons,  fats, oils, and so on, form a comparatively small proportion of the  rabbit's diet; the proverb of \"oil and water\" will remind the student  that these are insoluble. The nitrogenous bodies have their type in  the albumen of an egg; and muscle substance and the less modified  living \"protoplasm\" of plants, a considerable proportion of the  substance of seeds, bulbs, and so on, are albuminous bodies, or  proteids. These also are insoluble bodies, or when soluble, will not  diffuse easily through animal membranes.      Section 18. Now the essential problem which the digestive canal of  the rabbit solves is to get these insoluble, or quasi-insoluble, bodies  into its blood and system. They have to pass somehow into the  circulation through the walls of the alimentary canal. In order that a  compound should diffuse through a membrane, it must be both  soluble and diffusible, and therefore an essential preliminary to the  absorption of nutritive matter is its conversion into a diffusible soluble  form. This is effected by certain fluids, formed either by the walls of  the alimentary canal or by certain organs called glands, which open  by ducts into it; all these fluids contain small quantities of organic  compounds of the class called ferments, and these are the active  agents in the change. The soluble form of the carbohydrates is  sugar; proteids can be changed into the, of course, chemically  equivalent but soluble and diffusible the peptones; and fats and oils  undergo a more complicated, but finally similar change.      Section 19. We shall discuss the structure and action of -a gland-  [glands] a little more fully in a subsequent chapter. Here we will  simply say that they are organs forming each its characteristic fluid  or secretion, and sending it by a conduit, the duct, to the point  where its presence is required. The saliva in our mouths, tears, and  perspiration, are examples of the secretions of glands.      Section 20. In the month of the rabbit the food is acted upon by the  teeth and saliva. The saliva contains ptyalin, a ferment converting  starch into sugar, and it also serves to moisten the food as it is  ground up by the cheek teeth. It does not act on fat to any  appreciable extent. The teeth of the rabbit are shown in Figure XVIII.,  Sheet 4. The incisor teeth in front, two pairs above and one pair below  (i.), are simply employed in grasping the food; the cheek teeth-- the  premolars (pm.) and molars (m.) behind-- triturate the food by a  complicated motion over each. Their crowns are flat for this purpose,  with harder ridges running across them.      Section 21. This grinding up of the food in the mouth invariably  occurs in herbivorous animals, where there is a considerable amount  of starch and comparatively little hydrocarbon in the food. By finely  dividing the food, it ensures its intimate contact with the digestive  ferment, ptyalin. In such meat-eaters as the cat and dog, where little  starchy matter and much fat is taken, the saliva is, of course, of less  importance, and this mastication does not occur. The cheek teeth of  a dog ({Section 91}), and more so of a cat, are sharp, and used for  gnawing off fragments of food, which are swallowed at once.  Between the incisors and premolars of a dog come the  characteristic biting teeth, or canines, absent in the rabbit.      Section 22. The student will probably ask why the cheek teeth,  which are all similar in appearance, are divided into premolars and  molars. The rabbit has a set of milk molars-- a milk dentition-- which  are followed by the permanent teeth, just as in man. Those cheek  teeth of the second set, which have predecessors in the first series,  are called premolars; the ones posterior to these are the molars.      Section 23. After mastication, the food is worked by the tongue and  cheeks into a saliva-soaked \"bolus\" and swallowed. The passage  down the oesophagus is called deglutition. In the stomach it comes  under the influence of the gastric juice, formed in little glandular pits  in the stomach wall-- the gastric (Figure VIII. Sheet 3) and pyloric  glands. This fluid is distinctly acid, its acidity being due to about  one-tenth per cent {of a hundred} of hydrochloric acid, and it  therefore stops any further action of the ptyalin, which can act only  on neutral or slightly alkaline fluids. The gastric juice does not act on  carbo-hydrates or hydrocarbons to any very noticeable degree. Its  essential property is the conversion of proteids into peptones, and the  ferment by which this is effected is called pepsin. Milk contains  a peculiar soluble proteid, called casein, which is precipitated by a  special ferment, the rennet-ferment, and the insoluble proteid, the  curd, thus obtained is then acted on by the pepsin. In the  manufacture of cheese, the rennetferment obtained, from the  stomach of a calf is used to curdle the milk.      Section 24. After the food has undergone digestion in the stomach it  passes into the duodenum, the U-shaped loop of intestine  immediately succeeding the stomach. The duodenum is separated  from the stomach by a ring-like muscular valve, the pylorus; this  valve belongs to the class of muscles called sphincters, which, under  ordinary circumstances, are closed, but which relax to open the  circular central aperture. The valve at the anus, which retains the  faeces, is another instance of a sphincter.      Section 25. The food at this stage is called chyme; it is an acid and  soup-like fluid-- acid through the influence of the gastric juice. The  temperature of the animal's body is sufficiently high to keep most of  the fat in the food melted and floating in oily drops; much of the  starch, has been changed to sugar, and the solid proteids to soluble  peptones, but many fragments of material still float unchanged.      Section 26. It meets now with the bile, a greenish fluid secreted by  that large and conspicuous gland the liver. The bile is not simply a  digestive secretion, like the saliva or the gastric juice; it contains  matters destined to mix in, and after a certain amount of change to  be passed out of the body with, the faeces; among these  substances, of which some portion is doubtless excretory, are  compounds containing sulphur-- the bile salts. There is also a  colouring matter, bili verdin, which may possibly also be excretory. If  the student will compare Sections 10 and 11, he will notice that in  those paragraphs no account is taken of the sulphur among the  katastases, the account does not balance, and he will at once see  that here probably is the missing item on the outgoing side. The bile,  through the presence of these salts, is strongly alkaline, and so  stops the action of the gastric juice, and prepares for that of the  pancreas, which can act only in an alkaline medium. The fermentive  action of the bile is trifling; it dissolves fats, to a certain extent, and  is antiseptic, that is, it prevents putrefaction to which the chyme  might be liable; it also seems to act as a natural purgative.      Section 27. The bile, as we shall see later, is by no means the sole  product of the liver.      Section 28. The pancreatic juice, the secretion of the pancreas is  remarkable as acting on all the food stuffs that have not already  become soluble. It emulsifies fats, that is, it breaks, the drops up  into extremely small globules, forming a milky fluid, and it  furthermore has a fermentive action upon them; it splits them up into  fatty acids, and the soluble body glycerine. The fatty acids combine  with alkaline substances (Section 26) to form bodies which belong to  the chemical group of Soaps, and which are soluble also. The  pancreatic juice also attacks any proteids that have escaped the  gastric juice, and converts them into peptones, and any residual  starch into sugar. Hence by this stage, in the duodenum, all the food  constituents noticed in Section 17 are changed into soluble forms.  There are probably, three distinct ferments in the pancreatic juice  acting respectively on starch, fat, and proteid, but they have not  been isolated, and the term pancreatin is sometimes used to  suggest the three together.      Section 29. A succus entericus, a saliva-like fluid secreted by  numerous small glands in the intestine wall (Brunner's glands,  Lieberkuhnian follicles), probably aids, to an unknown but  comparatively small extent, in the digestive processes.      Section 30. The walls of the whole of the small intestine are engaged  in the absorption of the soluble results of digestion. In the  duodenum, especially, small processes, the villi project into the  cavity, and being, like the small hairs of velvet pile, and as thickly  set, give its inner coat a velvety appearance. In a villus we find  (Figure IX., Sheet 3) a series of small blood-vessels and with it  another vessel called a lacteal. The lacteals run together into larger  and larger branches until they form a main trunk, the thoracic duct,  which opens into the blood circulation at a point near the heart; but  of this we shall speak further later. They contain, after a meal, a fluid  called chyle.      Section 31. Emulsified fats pass into the chyle. Water and diffusible  salts certainly pass into the vein. The course taken by the peptones  is uncertain, but Professor Foster favours the chyle in the case of  the rabbit-- the student should read his Text-book of Physiology,  Part 2, Chapter 1, Section 11, if interested in the"]]]
