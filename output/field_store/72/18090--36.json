He  would like him also, as soon as possible, to procure from each of the  local assemblies in India and Burmah a full list of the members and  office-bearers of the Local Spiritual Assembly with the address of the  Secretary, and to transmit a copy of that list to Shoghi Effendi. This is  to be done every year immediately after the election of the National  Spiritual Assembly.    Further it is desirable that each local Assembly should have a register of  the names and addresses of all declared Baha'is in their district and  should be careful to keep the register up-to-date, promptly noting any  changes in the address or number of the believers. It is also desirable  that the National Secretary should have a list of all believers in India  and Burmah who are living in districts where there is no Local Spiritual  Assembly, with full postal address in each case, so that these believers  may be kept in touch with the body of believers by letters, literature  etc., and travelling Baha'is visiting these districts may be put in touch  with the believers there. Shoghi Effendi would like to have a copy of this  list also.    The National Secretary should keep in as close touch as possible with the  Local Spiritual Assemblies, should urge the secretaries of these Local  Assemblies to furnish regular reports of the progress of the movement in  their respective localities, and should, by means of circular letters  etc., keep these local assemblies and isolated believers informed of all  matters of importance affecting the Cause, remind them of the importance  of contributing as regularly and generously as possible to the National  Fund, and so on.    It is obvious that to carry out these manifold duties efficiently,  thoroughly and tactfully is no easy task and Shoghi Effendi greatly hopes  that some one may be found who will be able to devote the necessary  ability, time and energy to carry them out satisfactorily.    A Baha'i Year Book is now in course of preparation and Shoghi Effendi  wishes to include in this Year-Book a complete list of the local Spiritual  Assemblies throughout the world, with the address of the Secretary in each  case, also a complete list of those localities where there are resident  Baha'is but where no local Spiritual Assembly exists. It will probably be  impracticable to include the addresses of all isolated believers, but  these should be known to the Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly  in each country, so that they may be available on application to him.    It will interest you to know that the Baha'is of Egypt have just elected  their first National Spiritual Assembly.    [From the Guardian:]    Your past and present efforts are indeed worthy of the deepest admiration  and the highest praise. Concentrate as much as you can at present on the  consolidation of the foundations of the N.S.A. of India and Burma. This is  the first and most essential step to further expansion in any direction.  The institution of the National Fund is of vital importance and should be  greatly stressed and emphasized in every circular or communication  addressed to the friends. I will continue to pray for you from all my  heart and assure you of my support and brotherly love.    May 12, 1925          The House of Baha'u'llah in Baghdad      Yesterday he ordered me to write a few words and acknowledge the receipt  of your letter, conveying to you his love and greeting. He was much  pleased to see that you have followed his telegraphic instructions  concerning the Baghdad House promptly.    From other centres also telegraphic communications have been done to both  the High Commissioner and to His Majesty King Faisal. We are hoping for a  desirable result. Up to this time no definite information has reached us.  We shall keep you informed as soon as we receive any.    [From the Guardian:]    The prompt and effective measures you have taken are worthy of the highest  praise. I will inform you if further action is deemed necessary. I hope  and pray your devoted efforts will yield abundant fruit in the near  future.    November 18, 1925          Inaugurate a Fresh Campaign of Teaching      Shoghi Effendi prays for all of you and hopes that through your practical  devotion, you will all attract divine assistance more and more day by day  and so this coming year the Cause of God will make unprecedented progress  in that country. He sends you and all the members of the National  Spiritual Assembly his affectionate greeting and expects your good news  regularly.    [From the Guardian:]    I pray that your newly constituted National Spiritual Assembly may grow  from strength to strength, may co-ordinate and consolidate the  ever-expanding activities of the friends in India and Burma and inaugurate  a fresh campaign of Teaching that will redound to the glory and power of  the Most Great Name.    May the projected Congress at Cawnpore attract widespread interest and  stimulate the work undertaken by the friends in that promising country. I  assure you of my best wishes for your success.    November 24, 1925          Increasing Activities      It is always a source of immeasurable joy and encouragement to our dear  Guardian to learn of your increasing activities in serving our dear Cause  and also of the growing measure of success which you are meeting with in  all your endeavours. The unity of the friends in India and Burma, the  spread of the Cause in that vast country and especially among the real  natives, intelligent connections with the universities and schools and the  direction of the thoughts of the students to a proper understanding of the  Cause and its great mission on earth, will not only be real accomplishment  on the part of our dear fellow-workers but will relieve to a very large  extent our dear Guardian of the stupendous task that he shoulders, and  will give him the deepest joy and confidence. We earnestly trust that  through the help of our dear Master from on high all your efforts will be  crowned with success.    Shoghi Effendi is always interested to hear from you on the work in India  and to help you in every possible way.    You are, I am sure, in touch with Mr. Horace Holley in America and you  would be interested to know that they are publishing soon a Baha'i Year  Book which will be of widespread interest not only to the Baha'is but also  to many interested men and women in our dear Cause.    Mrs. Stannard is very successful in her work in Geneva and she has already  started a fine center there. She is able to make many connections with  influential men and learned people and this is in itself a great work.    [From the Guardian:]    I am very pleased and gratified to learn of your persistent efforts in  advancing and consolidating the Cause. The establishment of a Central  Office in Delhi is a great step forward and I await very eagerly the first  issue of the publication of the National Spiritual Assembly of India &  Burma. The Burmese friends are very satisfied and pleased with the  consideration shown and the activity displayed by your Assembly and my  prayer is that the relations of the National Body with the local  Assemblies will grow firmer everyday. I will specially remember the  friends who are promoting the Cause among the Qadiyani community whenever  I visit the Shrines. I wish them the fullest success.    March 27, 1926          Bring Together the Hindus and Mohammedans      Shoghi Effendi received your letter dated June 11th and was very glad to  see the result of the election of the National Spiritual Assembly. He  sincerely hopes that this year will witness a great change and progress  for the Cause in India. As the friends are sincere in their love and  devotion, the members of the Assembly strong in their faith and unfailing  in their services, there is full assurance of an ultimate victory and  final settlement of the existing difficulties. Shoghi Effendi has great  hopes in you personally and trusts in your wise judgment, watchful  attentiveness and absolute assurance in the Cause you serve. He wants me  to assure you of his prayers.    He also hopes that the friends in India will do their very best to bring  together the Hindus and Mohammedans. In such cases the friends can show  their good-will, devotion to humanity, and disinterestedness in the  material result obtained. He will pray that ... Prof. Pritam Singh will be  guided in this undertaking and ably represent the spirit of the Cause as  well as its teachings. Being competent themselves and having the necessary  divine blessing and guidance it is sure that they will achieve much. May  be this will be a good chance for attracting the attention of some of the  prominent leaders to the reality of the Cause.    [From the Guardian:]    I have written in person to the Bombay Assembly and urged them most  emphatically to support morally and financially the National Assembly and  the National Fund. ...We have to repeat and repeat over and over again  until the truth, the necessity and the urgency of our Beloved's  instructions sink in the hearts and minds of the believers. I am sure you  will continue to remind the friends of their primary obligations. Assuring  you again of my prayers for your success in your high endeavours.    July 10, 1926          Cause Will Ultimately Conquer      'Abdu'l-Baha used often to say that the difference between a prophet and  an ordinary person is that the latter looks only to the present. He does  not try to imagine the future victories and thereby forget the present  trivial obstructions. The prophet, however, having a deep insight in the  future condition of things sees his ultimate victory and does not get  disheartened even though he sees a whole-sale massacre of his followers.    As Baha'is we should follow the prophet's method. We know that the Cause  will ultimately conquer and its ranks be fully united. We know that the  Master'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#4)"],[1," as safe and comfortable as  possible.    The Guardian himself is eagerly looking forward to the pleasure of meeting  her, and cherishes the hope that through this pilgrimage she may receive a  renewed stimulus to better work for the promotion of the Faith upon her  return home.    The Guardian has also noted with deep satisfaction the preparations made  by your N.S.A. for this year's meeting in Melbourne. He is praying that in  spite of the difficulties you have encountered in carrying out your plans  this important gathering of the Australian and New-Zealand believers may  prove another landmark in the history of the Cause throughout that  Continent.    With loving greetings to you and your dear fellow-members,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [Appended by the Guardian]    May the Almighty bless you and your dearly-loved co-workers and  fellow-members, and enable you all to proclaim far and wide the essential  truths of this glorious Revelation and to lay unassailable foundations for  its institutions.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JUNE 10TH, 1936      June 10th, 1936    Dear Miss Brooks,    I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge with deepest thanks  the receipt of your letter of March 30th written on behalf of the N.S.A.  of Australia and New-Zealand.    He is rejoiced to learn of the projected formation of a Spiritual Assembly  in Perth, and hopes that by the time this letter reaches you the assembly  will have been duly constituted and will be functioning with the utmost  unity, efficiency and vigour.    In this connection he wishes me to bring to your Assembly's attention the  necessity of their taking the necessary steps for the incorporation of the  N.S.A.. This step, he feels, is of a vital importance to the further  development of your Assembly, and will no doubt give it more stability and  an added influence, specially in the eyes of the general public.    The Guardian would also advise that the local assemblies take a similar  step, and obtain official recognition from the authorities. In case the  Auckland assembly has been registered in the government, will you be so  kind as to send him photostatic reproductions of any registration papers  or documents that the Auckland friends may have obtained from the  authorities, as he wishes to have them published in the next \"Baha'i  World\".    As regards the photograph of your N.S.A; the Guardian wishes me to inform  you that in going over the manuscript of the \"Baha'i World\", which was  sent to him from the States, he found your Assembly's picture already  incorporated in it. The manuscript has now been sent back to America and  is awaiting publication.    With loving Baha'i greetings,  Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    The incessant efforts so devotedly exerted by the members of your  distinguished assembly are assets that I greatly value and of which I am  truly proud. I will fervently pray for the extension of your activities  and the fulfilment of your dearest hopes. Rest assured and persevere.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 23RD, 1936      September 23rd, 1936    Dear Miss Brooks,    Your detailed communication of July 14th written on behalf of the N.S.A.  of Australia and New-Zealand, together with its enclosures have all duly  arrived, and their contents read with deepest interest and appreciation by  our beloved Guardian. Also the photographs and blocks have duly reached  him, as well as the local Assembly reports sent under separate cover.  Please accept his most sincere and grateful thanks for them all.    Regarding the proposed News Letter to be issued every three months by your  N.S.A; this, the Guardian feels, is a splendid idea and can render a  unique and much-needed help to your Assembly in its efforts for the  establishment of the Administration, and the more effective functioning of  its institutions throughout Australia and New-Zealand. Not only it has the  great advantage of keeping the friends well-informed about the events and  developments in the Cause, but in addition can help in consolidating the  organic unity of the believers by bringing them within the full orbit of  the N.S.A.'s jurisdiction. It is hoped that this body will do its utmost  to maintain the publication of this bulletin, and will make full use of  this splendid medium for the further widening and consolidation of the  foundations of the local as well as national assemblies.    As regards Mrs. ...'s request that you assist her in her project of  uniting the believers through correspondence; this is of course a task  which is quite secondary compared to the duties and responsibilities you  are called upon to discharge as secretary of the N.S.A. Your secretarial  work in that body imposes upon you a paramount obligation which no other  service can equal in importance. All your other Baha'i activities should  be subordinated to your work in the N.S.A. which is, undoubtedly, the most  vital and urgent among them all.    Concerning the Greatest Name; this term refers both to \"Allah-u-Abha\" and  to \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha\". The first is a form of Baha'i greeting and should  be used, while the other is an invocation, meaning \"O Thou Glory of  Glories!\" These two words are both referred to as the Greatest Name.    The Guardian, while fully aware of the difficulties, both financial and  otherwise which your N.S.A. is facing in connection with the publication  of the \"Herald of the South\", feels nevertheless the urge to advise you to  continue with this magazine and not to feel in the least discouraged if  your efforts for meeting the expenses incurred for its printing and  circulation, and for raising its literary standard, do not bring the  expected results. He very deeply values the self-sacrificing and sustained  efforts exerted by your Assembly in this connection. May Baha'u'llah  richly reward you for all your meritorious endeavours.    With warmest Baha'i Greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    The work in which your National Assembly is engaged, and which it is  prosecuting with such fidelity, diligence and perseverance is near and  dear to my heart. You are laying an unassailable foundation for the  erection of mighty Baha'i institutions which future generations are  destined to extend and perfect. Your pioneer work is arduous and highly  meritorious. I feel proud of your achievements, realizing as I do the  circumstances in which you labour. 'Abdu'l-Baha is watching over you and  is well-pleased with your services. Persevere and rest assured.    Affectionately,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 25TH, 1936      September 25th, 1936    Dear Miss Brooks,    Our able and indefatigable co-worker Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher is on a  tour to Australia, India and the Near East, and by the time this letter  reaches you he may be already in your midst.    The Guardian wishes your N.S.A. to arrange for him to visit all the  centers in Australia and if possible in New-Zealand too, and to make every  effort to render his stay amongst you as abundant in its results as  possible.    Mr. Schopflocher is surely known to you and to many friends in Australia.  He is truly one of the most distinguished believers in the West. He has a  deep knowledge of the Cause, and specially of the Administration, and has  contributed a unique share towards its establishment and consolidation in  the States. For many years a member of the American N.S.A., he revealed  such great qualities of heart and mind as very few of his fellow-members  were able to manifest. He supported valiantly and generously, and through  both moral and financial means, the various institutions of the Cause, and  in particular the institution of the Baha'i Fund which, as you can well  realize, is the foundation stone of every phase of Baha'i activity.    In this connection it should be remembered that it was mainly due to his  unfailing and most generous assistance that the Temple in Wilmette was  built. The friends owe him indeed a great debt, and can never be too  grateful for what he has accomplished, and is still so splendidly  accomplishing, for the Faith in the West.    The Guardian hopes, nay he feels confident, your Assembly, as well as all  the friends will extend a most cordial welcome to this dear and  distinguished Servant of the Cause, and will fully avail yourselves of  this splendid opportunity that has been offered you to further enrich the  field of your experiences in the Faith.    With warmest greetings,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.            LETTER OF NOVEMBER 17TH, 1936      November 17th, 1936    Dear Miss Brooks,    On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with deepest thanks the receipt of  your letter of the 17th October, and wish also to thank your Assembly for  forwarding to him the photostatic reproduction of the registration  certificate of the Assembly of Auckland. He fervently hopes that the  formation of the Declaration of Trust of the N.S.A. will also be completed  very soon, and that the difficulty you have encountered in this connection  will be satisfactorily met and settled. He also trusts that the delay  caused in registering the Sydney local assembly will be overcome, and that  you will immediately proceed with the formation of your National  Declaration of Trust. It is splendid, and a matter of deep satisfaction to  our Beloved Guardian that in all these steps that you are taking for the  administrative development and consolidation of the Faith in Australia and  New-Zealand you are closely and faithfully following the example of  America which, it should be admitted, occupies a pre-eminent rank among  its sister communities in both the East and the West.    As regards the problem facing the N.S.A. in connection with the  representation of Perth at"]]]
