[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#4)"],[1," the influence of music, Martin Luther sang the Reformation  into the hearts of the people with his noble chorals in which every one  might join. He called music a mistress of order and good manners, and  introduced it into the schools as a means of refinement and discipline,  in whose presence anger and all evil would depart. \"A schoolmaster,\"  said he, \"ought to have skill in music, otherwise I would not regard  him; neither should we ordain young men to the office of preaching  unless they have been well exercised in the art, for it maketh a fine  people.\" It were well if teachers and ministers to-day more generally  appreciated the value of music to them and their work.    Music is an essential factor in great national movements. Every  commander knows how inspiring and comforting it is to his men. Napoleon  Bonaparte, who was not readily lifted out of himself and who complained  that music jarred his nerves, was shrewd enough to observe its effect on  marching troops, and to order the bands of different regiments to play  daily in front of hospitals to soothe and cheer the wounded. The one  tune he prized, Malbrook, he hummed as he started for his last campaign.  In the solitude of St. Helena he said: \"Of all liberal arts music has  the greatest influence over the passions, and it is that to which the  legislator ought to give the most encouragement.\"    An art that in some form is found in the varied activities of all  people, at all times, must be the common heritage of humanity. \"It does  not speak to one class but to mankind,\" said Robert Franz, the German  song writer. Alexander Bain called it the most available, universal and  influential of the fine arts, and Dr. Marx, the musical theorist,  thought music beneficial to the moral and spiritual estate of the  masses.    Truly indeed has it been said that its universality gives music its high  worth. Mirroring neither your inner life alone nor mine, but the  world's essence, the transfiguration of what seems real, the divine  Ideal, some spark of which glows in every bosom, each individual may  feel in it whatever he is capable of feeling. The soul's language, it  takes up the thread dropped by words and gives utterance to those  refined sentiments and holy aspirations words are inadequate to awaken  or express. Its message is borne from heart to heart, revealing to each  things unseen, according as it is prepared to receive them.    In the Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare made Lorenzo speak to Jessica of  the harmony that is in immortal souls and say that \"whilst this muddy  vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it.\" To refine  this muddy vesture, to render the spirit attentive, to bring light,  sweetness, strength, harmony and beauty into daily life is the central  function of music which, from the cradle to the grave, is man's most  intimate companion.    Richard Wagner devoutly believed it would prepare the way for an  unspoiled, unfettered humanity, illumined by a perception of Truth and  Beauty and united by a bond of sympathy and love. This ideal union is  the goal at which Tolstoi aims in his \"What is Art?\" He defines art as a  human activity to be enjoyed by all, whose purpose is the transmission  of the most exalted feelings to which men have arisen; but the union he  proposes would have to be consummated by a leveling process. All art  that cannot without preparation reach the uncultured classes is  denounced by him. He is most bitter in his denunciation of Wagner, who  fought for a democratic art, but who wished to attain it by raising the  lowliest of his fellow-creatures to an ever loftier plane of high  thinking and feeling.    According to Tolstoi, art began to degenerate when it separated itself  from religion. There must have been dense mist before the Russian sage's  mental vision when he fancied this separation possible. Art, especially  musical art, is a vital part of religion, and cannot be put asunder from  it. Like thought, music, since the bonds of church and state have been  broken, has spread wide its pinions and soared to hitherto unsuspected  heights. All noble music is sacred.    Amid the marvelous material progress of to-day music is more needed than  ever. Unburdened by the responsibility of fact, it brings relief to the  soul from the grinding pressure of constant grappling with knowledge.  The benefits of knowledge are great, but it is also beneficial to be  uplifted, as we may be by music, from out the perplexing labyrinth of  the work-a-day world toward the realm of the Divine Ideal.    As a means of culture music is a potent factor in human civilization. It  is destined to wield even greater influence than has yet been known. It  has become the household art of to-day. As it enters more and more fully  into the heart of the home and social life it will more and more enrich  human existence and aid in ushering in the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth.    If music can do so much for mankind, why are not all musicians great and  good? Ah, my friend, that is a hard question to answer, and can only be  fairly treated by asking another equally difficult question: Why are not  all people who have enjoyed the advantages of religion wise and noble?  Consider the gigantic machinery that has been put in motion to  promulgate Christianity, and note how slow men have been to appropriate  the teachings of its founder. Slow progress furnishes no argument  against the mission either of religion or its comrade music.    In common with religion music kindles our finer sensibilities and brings  us into an atmosphere superior to that which ordinarily surrounds us. It  requires wisdom to beautify commonplace conditions with what has been  enjoyed in aerial regions. Rightly applied, music can lend itself to  this illumination. As it is better known, its advantages will be more  completely realized.          II    Blunders in Music Study      Like a voice from the Unseen, the Eternal, music speaks to the soul of  man. Its informing word being delivered in the language of the emotional  nature finds some response to its appeal in every normal human breast.  Shakespeare indicated this truth when he had his Lorenzo, in the  Merchant of Venice, say:        _\"The man that hath no music in himself,      Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,      Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;      The motions of his spirit are dull as night,      And his affections dark as Erebus;      Let no such man be trusted.\"_    It is not the normal soul, fresh from its Creator's hands, that is fit  for such dire evils, but the soul perverted by false conditions and  surroundings. Where vice has become congenial and the impure reigns  supreme, that which rouses and expresses noble aspirations and pure  emotions can find no room. Normal instincts may also be dulled, the  inner being made, as it were, musically deaf and dumb, by a false  education which stifles and dwarfs the finer feelings, or by  circumstances which permit these to remain dormant.    The emotional natures of human beings differ as widely in kind and  degree as the intellectual and physical natures. In some people  sensibility predominates, and the irresistible activity of fancy and  feeling compels the expression in rhythmic tone combinations of ideals  grasped intuitively. Thus musical genius manifests itself. No amount of  education can bring it into being, but true culture and wise guidance  are needed to equip it for its bold flight. \"Neither diligence without  genius, nor genius without education will produce anything thorough,\"  as we read in Horace. Other people with marked aptitude for musical  expression have reproductive rather than creative endowments. To them  belongs talent in a greater or less degree, and they are adapted to  promulgate the message which genius formulated for mankind. Talent may  be ripened and brightened by suitable environments and fostering care.    There are besides persons led by genius or talent into other avenues  than those of the tone-world, and the great public with its diverse  grades of emotional and intellectual gifts. The cultivation of the  aesthetic tastes is profitable to all, and no agency contributes so  freely to it as music. Too many people engaged in purely scientific or  practical pursuits have failed to realize this. In those nations known  as musical, and that have become so through generations occupied with  the art, music study is placed on an equal footing with any other worthy  pursuit and no life interest is permitted to exclude musical enthusiasm.    Unless disabled by physical defects, every one displays some sense of  musical sound and rhythmic motion. It is a constant occurrence for  children, without a word of direction, to mark the time of a stirring  tune with hands, feet and swaying motions of the body. A lullaby will  almost invariably soothe a restless infant, and most children old enough  to distinguish and articulate groups of tones will make some attempt at  singing the melodies they have often heard. The average child begins  music lessons with evident pleasure.    It should be no more difficult to strengthen the musical instincts than  any other faculties. On the contrary, it too often chances that a child  whose early song efforts have been in excellent time and tune, and not  without expression, who has marched in time and beat time accurately,  will, after a period of instruction, utterly disregard sense of rhythm,  sing out of tune, play wrong notes, or fail to notice when the musical  instrument used is ever so cruelly out of tune. Uneducated people,  trusting to intuitive perceptions, promptly decide that such or such a  child, or person, has been spoiled by cultivation. This is merely a  failure to trace a result to its rightful cause, which lies not in  cultivation, but in certain blunders in music study.    These blunders begin with the preliminary course on the piano or violin,  for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#4)"],[1,"with his family to  complete the sacrifice.    The queen, Dharini, overjoyed with the news of her son's success and  safety, distributes rich presents to all her train and the females of  Agnimitra's establishment, whilst to him she presents Malavika. Iravati  communicates her concurrence in this arrangement, and the Raja obtains a  bride, whom his queens accept as their sister. The difficulty of  conciliating his queens is thus removed. The king now marries Malavika  and all ends happily.          THE VIRA CHARITA OR THE MAHAVIRA CHARITA    OR    THE LIFE OF THE GREAT HERO.      Dasaratha, the king of Ayodhya (Oudh), is the father of four sons Rama,  Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna. Rama and Lakshmana visit Viswamitra's  hermitage. Kusadhwaja, the king of Sankasya and the brother of Janaka,  the king of Mithila, accompanied by his two nieces, Sita and Urmila,  enters the hermitage of Viswamitra on the borders of the Kausiki (Cosi),  having been invited by the sage to his sacrifice. He is met by the sage  with the two youths Rama and Lakshmana, and the young couples become  mutually enamoured. Meanwhile Ahalya--the cursed wife of Gautama--gets  cleared of her guilt through the purifying influence of Rama.    A messenger from Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, arrives, who has  followed them from Mithila, and comes to demand Sita as a wife for his  master.    They are further disturbed by Taraka, a female fiend, the daughter of  Suketu, wife of Sunda and mother of Maricha. Rama, by command of  Viswamitra slays her. Viswamitra is exceedingly pleased with the deed  and invokes and gives to Rama the heavenly weapons with all their  secrets of discharge and dissolution. The sage recommends Kusadhwaja to  invite the bow of Siva for Rama's present trial, and consequent  obtaining of Sita. The bow arrives, self-conveyed, being, as the weapon  of so great a deity, pregnant with intelligence. Rama snaps it asunder,  in consequence of which feat it is agreed that Sita shall be wedded to  him; Urmila her sister, to Lakshmana; and Mandavi and Srutakirti, the  daughters of Kusadhwaja, to Bharata and Satrughna respectively. The  party is again disturbed by Suvahu and Maricha, the first of whom is  killed and the second, thrown at a distance by Rama.    The messenger of Ravana then goes away mortified to represent the matter  to the minister of Ravana. The saint and his visitors then retire into  the hermitage.    Malyavan, the minister and maternal grandfather of Ravana and the king's  sister Surpanakha have heard the news of Rama's wedding with Sita from  Siddhasrama and discuss the consequences with some apprehension. The  minister takes the marriage as an insult to his master.    A letter arrives from Parasurama partly requesting and partly commanding  Ravana to call off some of his imps, who are molesting the sages in  Dandakaranya. He writes from Mahendra Dwipa.    Malyavan takes advantage of this opportunity to instigate a quarrel  between the two Ramas, anticipating that Parasurama, who is the pupil of  Siva, will be highly incensed when he hears of Rama's breaking the bow  of that divinity. The hero comes to Videha, the palace of Janaka, to  defy the insulter of his god and preceptor. He enters the interior of  the palace, the guards and attendants being afraid to stop him, and  calls upon Rama to show himself. The young hero is proud of Parasurama's  seeking him and anxious for the encounter but detained awhile by Sita's  terrors: at last the heroes meet. Parasurama alludes to his own history  how he, having overcome his fellow-pupil, Kartikeya, in a battle-axe  fight, received his axe from his preceptor, Siva, as the prize of his  prowess.    Parasurama addresses Rama thus:--    \"How dost thou presume to bend thy brow in frowns on me? Thou must be an  audacious boy, a scion of the vile Kshatriya race. Thy tender years and  newly wedded bride teach me a weakness I am not wont to feel.    Throughout the world the story runs, I, Rama, and the son of Jamadgni,  struck off a mother's head with remorseless arm. This vengeful axe has  one and twenty times destroyed the Kshatriya race, not sparing in its  wrath the unborn babe hewn piecemeal in the parent womb.    It was thus I slaked the fires of a wronged father's wrath with blood,  whose torrents, drawn unsparingly from martial veins, fed the vast  reservoir in which I love to bathe.\"    Rama replies thus:--    \"Give over thy vaunts--I hold thy cruelty a crime, not virtue.\"    The combat between the two Ramas is suspended by the arrival of Janaka  and Satananda, and Rama's being summoned to attend the Kanchana Mochana,  the loosening of Sita's golden bracelet.    Parasurama awaits Ramachandra's return. He is accosted in succession by  Vasishtha, Viswamitra, Satananda, Janaka and Dasaratha, who first  endeavour to soothe and then to terrify him; but he outbullies them all:  at last Ramachandra returns from the string-removing ceremony and is  heard calling on Parasurama, and the combat ensues. Ramachandra comes  out victorious.    The two kings Janaka and Dasaratha congratulate each other on the  victory of Ramachandra. Parasurama is now as humble as he was before  arrogant: he calls upon the earth to hide his shame. Whilst Rama regrets  Bhargava's departure, Surpanakha, disguised as Manthara, the favourite  of Kaikeyi, Dasaratha's second wife, arrives with a letter to Rama,  requesting him to use his influence with his father to secure Kaikeyi  the two boons which Dasaratha was pledged to grant her; specifying one  to be her son Bharata's inauguration, and the other, assent to Rama's  voluntary exile. In the meantime, Dasaratha, who has determined to raise  Rama to the participation of regal dignity, communicates his intention  to his son. Rama replies by informing him of Kaikeyi's message, and is  earnest with his father to accede to her request.    Bharata and his maternal uncle Yuddhajit arrive, and ask Dasaratha to  crown Rama and all are full of wonder and concern: however, as there is  no help for it, Dasaratha consents and orders preparations for the  ceremony.    Lakshmana and Sita are alone to accompany Rama, on which her father  Janaka exclaims, \"My child, what happiness it will be to wait upon thy  husband in the hour of trouble, permitted to partake and cheer his  wanderings!\" Bharata requests permission to go with them, but Rama  refuses his assent; on which his brother begs his golden shoes of him,  promising to instal them in the kingdom, and rule thereafter as their  representative. The seniors are led out in deep despondency, and Rama  with his brother and wife set off to the woods.    A dialogue opens between the two birds, Jatayu and Sampati, the  vulture-descendants of Kasyapa, who have seen successive creations. They  relate Rama's progress towards the south; and Sampati, the elder leaves  his brother Jatayu, with strict injunctions to assist Rama, if needed.  He then goes to the ocean to perform daily duties and Jatayu to Malaya.  Jatayu perches on the mountain and marks the hero Rama in pursuit of the  swift deer. Lakshmana directs his remote course thither. A holy seer  approaches the bower and the dame gives him meet welcome. His form  expands.    It is he, the felon Ravana--his train crowd from the groves; he seizes  upon Sita--he mounts the car. Jatayu cries shame on his birth and  threatens to rend his limbs and revel in his gore. Jatayu is, however,  killed in the conflict. Rama raves with indignation. The brothers set  off in pursuit of the ravisher, when Sramana, a female devotee sent by  Vibhishana to Rama, calls for succour being seized by Kabandha, a  headless fiend. Rama sends Lakshmana to her rescue; he goes off to kill  the demon and returns with the dame. She gives Rama a note from  Vibhishana praying for his refuge. Rama asks Lakshmana what reply to be  sent to (his) \"dear friend--lord of Lanka\" and Lakshman replies that  those words are sufficient.    (Two promises are implied--first contraction of friendship and secondly  bestowal of the Kingdom of Lanka.)    Rama, learning from the devotee that Vibhishana is with Sugriva,  Hanuman, and other monkey chiefs at Rishyamuka, and that the monkeys  have picked up Sita's ornaments and upper garments in the forest,  determines to go to them. Kabandha then appears, to thank Rama for  killing him, being thereby liberated from a curse and restored to a  divine condition.    They then set off to Rishyamuka, the residence of Bali, watered by the  Pampa. In the way Rama performs a miracle by kicking away the skeleton  of a giant.    When the brothers arrive at the mountain, Bali appears like a cloud upon  its peak and, being instigated by his friend Malyavan, resolves to  oppose Rama. The heroes meet and, after exchange of civilities, go to  the conflict.    The noise brings Vibhishana, Sugriva, and all the monkey chiefs to the  place. Bali is overthrown and mortally wounded. He recommends the  Monkeys to choose Sugriva and his own son Angada for their joint  sovereigns, and mediates an alliance between Rama and them, as well as  with Vibhishana. Rama and Sugriva pledge themselves to eternal  friendship, over the sacrificial fire in Matanga's hermitage which stood  close by. Bali then repeats his request to the monkey chiefs, as they  were attached to him, to acknowledge Sugriva and Angada as their joint  leaders, and to follow them in aid of Rama against Ravana in the ensuing  contest: he then dies.    Malyavan laments over these miscarriages. Trijata, a Rakshasi, adds to  his despondency by news of the mischief inflicted by Hanumana, who has  burnt the town of Lanka and slain a son of Ravana. He goes off to set  guards, and gather news by means of spies.    Ravana meditates on his love. His queen Mahodhari comes to bring him  tidings of Rama's approach, but he only laughs at her. She tells him of  the bridge made by Rama: he replies, if all the mountains of the earth  were cast into"]]]
