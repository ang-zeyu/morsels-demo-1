[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17829"],[0,"The Trained Memory (#4)"],[1,"ks_]    The attention operates in a manner complementary to the general Laws of  Recall. It is an active principle not of association, but of  _dissociation_.    You choose, for example, a certain aim in life. You decide to become the  inventor of an aeroplane of automatic stability. This choice henceforth  determines two things. First, it determines just which of the sensory  experiences of any given moment are most likely to be selected for your  conscious perception. Secondly, it determines just which of your past  experiences will be most likely to be recalled.    Such a choice, in other words, determines to some extent the sort of  elements that will most probably be selected to make up at any moment  the contents of your consciousness.    [Sidenote: _Iron Filings and Mental Magnets_]    From the instant that you make such a choice you are on the alert for  facts relevant to the subject of your ambition. Upon them you  concentrate your attention. They are presented to your consciousness  with greater precision and clearness than other facts. All facts that  pertain to the art of flying henceforth cluster and cling to your  conscious memory like iron filings to a magnet. All that are impertinent  to this main pursuit are dissociated from these intensely active  complexes, and in time fade into subconscious forgetfulness.    [Sidenote: _The Compartment of Subconscious Forgetfulness_]    By subconscious forgetfulness we mean a _compartment_, as it were, of  that reservoir in which all past experiences are stored.    _Consciousness is a momentary thing._ It is a passing state. It is  ephemeral and flitting. It is made up _in part of present  sense-impressions_ and in part of past experiences. These past  experiences are brought forth from subconsciousness. Some are  voluntarily brought forth. Some present themselves without our conscious  volition, but by the operation of the laws of association and  dissociation. Some we seem unable voluntarily to recall, yet they may  appear when least we are expecting them. It is these last to which we  have referred as lost in subconscious forgetfulness. As a matter of  fact, _none_ are ever actually _lost_.    [Sidenote: _Making Experience Count_]    All the wealth of your past experience is still yours--a concrete part  of your personality. All that is required to make it available for your  present use is a sufficient concentration of your attention, _a  concentration of attention that shall dwell persistently and exclusively  upon those associations that bear upon the fact desired_.    The tendency of the mind toward dissociation, a function limiting the  indiscriminate recall of associated \"groups,\" is also manifested in all  of us in the transfer to unconsciousness of many _muscular activities_.    [Sidenote: _How Habits Are Formed_]    As infants we learn to walk only by giving to every movement of the  limbs the most deliberate conscious attention. Yet, in time, the  complicated co-operation of muscular movements involved in walking  becomes involuntary and unconscious, so that we are no longer even aware  of them.    It is the same with reading, writing, playing upon musical instruments,  the manipulation of all sorts of mechanical devices, the thousand and  one other muscular activities that become what we call _habitual_.    The moment one tries to make these habitual activities again dependent  on the conscious will he encounters difficulties.        \"The centipede was happy quite,      Until the toad, for fun,      Said, 'Pray which leg goes after which?'      This stirred his mind to such a pitch,      He lay distracted in a ditch,      Considering _how_ to run.\"    _All these habitual activities are started as acts of painstaking care  and conscious attention. All ultimately become unconscious._ They may,  however, be started or stopped at will. They are, therefore, still  related to the conscious mind. They occupy a semi-automatic middle  ground between conscious and subconscious activities.          THE FALLACY OF MOST MEMORY SYSTEMS    [Illustration: Decorative Header]      CHAPTER VI    THE FALLACY OF MOST MEMORY SYSTEMS      [Sidenote: _Practice in Memorizing Inadequate_]    It is evident that if what we have been describing as the process of  recall is true, then the commonly accepted idea that _practice_ in  memorizing makes memorizing _easier_ is false, and that there is no  truth in the popular figure of speech that likens the memory to a muscle  that grows stronger with use.    So far as the memory is concerned, however, practice may result in a  more or less unconscious improvement in the _methods_ of memorizing.    _By practice we come to unconsciously discover and employ new  associative methods in our recording of facts, making them easier to  recall, but we can certainly add nothing to the actual scope and power  of retention._    [Sidenote: _Torture of the Drill_]    Yet many books on memory-training have wide circulation whose authors,  showing no conception of the processes involved, seek to develop the  general ability to remember by incessant practice in memorizing  particular facts, just as one would develop a muscle by exercise.    The following is quoted from a well-known work of this character:    \"I am now treating a case of loss of memory in a person advanced in  years, who did not know that his memory had failed most remarkably  until I told him of it. He is making vigorous efforts to bring it back  again, and with partial success. The method pursued is to spend two  hours daily, one in the morning and one in the evening, in exercising  this faculty. The patient is instructed to give the closest attention to  all that he learns, so that it shall be impressed on his mind clearly.  He is asked to recall every evening all the facts and experiences of the  day, and again the next morning. Every name heard is written down and  impressed on his mind clearly and an effort made to recall it at  intervals. Ten names from among public men are ordered to be committed  to memory every week. A verse of poetry is to be learned, also a verse  from the Bible, daily. He is asked to remember the number of the page of  any book where any interesting fact is recorded. These and _other_  methods are slowly resuscitating a failing memory.\"    [Sidenote: _Real Cause of Failing Memory_]    As remarked by Professor James, \"It is hard to believe that the memory  of the poor old gentleman is a bit the better for all this torture  except in respect to the particular facts thus wrought into it, the  occurrences attended to and repeated on those days, the names of those  politicians, those Bible verses, etc., etc.\"    The error in the book first quoted from lies in the fact that its author  looks upon a failing memory as indicating a loss of retentiveness. The  _real_ cause is the loss of an intensity of interest. _It is the failure  to form sufficiently large groups and complexes of related ideas,  emotions and muscular movements associated with the particular fact to  be remembered. There is no reason to believe that the retention of  sensory experiences is not at all times perfectly mechanical and  mechanically perfect._    Interest is a mental yearning. It is the offspring of desire and the  mother of memory.    It goes out spontaneously to anything that can add to the sum of one's  knowledge about the thing desired.    [Sidenote: _The Manufactured Interest_]    A manufactured interest is counterfeit. When a thing is done because it  has to be done, desire dies and \"duty\" is born. In proportion as a  subject is associated with \"duty,\" it is divorced from interest.    [Sidenote: _Memory Lure of a Desire_]    If you want to impress anything on another man's mind so that he will  remember it, harness it up with the lure of a desire.    Diffused interest is the cause of all unprofitable forgetfulness. Do not  allow your attention to grope vaguely among a number of things. Whatever  you do, make a business of doing it with your whole soul. Turn the  spotlight of your mind upon it, and you will not forget it.    [Illustration: TESTING ABILITY TO OBSERVE, REMEMBER AND REPORT THINGS  SEEN PRIVATE LABORATORY, SOCIETY OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY]          A SCIENTIFIC MEMORY SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS    [Illustration: Decorative Header]      CHAPTER VII    A SCIENTIFIC MEMORY SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS      [Sidenote: _Importance of Associates_]    We recall things by their associates. _When you set your mind to  remember any particular fact, your conscious effort should be not  vaguely to will that it shall be impressed and retained, but  analytically and deliberately to connect it with one or more other facts  already in your mind._    [Sidenote: _\"Cramming\" and \"Willing\"_]    The student who \"crams\" for an examination makes no permanent addition  to his knowledge. There can be no recall without association, and  \"cramming\" allows no time to form associations.    If you find it difficult to remember a fact or a name, do not waste your  energies in \"willing\" it to return. Try to recall some other fact or  name associated with the first in time or place or otherwise, and lo!  when you least expect it, it will pop into your thoughts.    If your memory is good in most respects, but poor in a particular line,  it is because you do not interest yourself in that line, and therefore  have no material for association. Blind Tom's memory was a blank on most  subjects, but he was a walking encyclopedia on music.    [Sidenote: _Basic Principle of Thought-Reproduction_]    _To improve your memory you must increase the number and variety of your  mental associations._    Many ingenious methods, scientifically correct, have been devised to aid  in the remembering of particular facts. These methods are based wholly  on the principle that _that is most easily recalled which is associated  in our minds with the most complex and elaborate groupings of related  ideas_.

The cow was frightened at his  violence, and kicked down the pail and spilt the milk all about. My master  knew that this accident was his own fault, but he was so enraged that he  seemed glad of an excuse to go on with his ill usage. I cannot remember  how many licks he gave me then, but he beat me till I was unable to stand,  and till he himself was weary.    After this I ran away and went to my mother, who was living with Mr.  Richard Darrel. My poor mother was both grieved and glad to see me;  grieved because I had been so ill used, and glad because she had not seen  me for a long, long while. She dared not receive me into the house, but  she hid me up in a hole in the rocks near, and brought me food at night,  after every body was asleep. My father, who lived at Crow-Lane, over the  salt-water channel, at last heard of my being hid up in the cavern, and he  came and took me back to my master. Oh I was loth, loth to go back; but as  there was no remedy, I was obliged to submit.    When we got home, my poor father said to Capt. I----, \"Sir, I am sorry  that my child should be forced to run away from her owner; but the  treatment she has received is enough to break her heart. The sight of her  wounds has nearly broke mine.--I entreat you, for the love of God, to  forgive her for running away, and that you will be a kind master to her in  future.\" Capt. I---- said I was used as well as I deserved, and that I  ought to be punished for running away. I then took courage and said that I  could stand the floggings no longer; that I was weary of my life, and  therefore I had run away to my mother; but mothers could only weep and  mourn over their children, they could not save them from cruel  masters--from the whip, the rope, and the cow-skin. He told me to hold my  tongue and go about my work, or he would find a way to settle me. He did  not, however, flog me that day.    For five years after this I remained in his house, and almost daily  received the same harsh treatment. At length he put me on board a sloop,  and to my great joy sent me away to Turk's Island. I was not permitted to  see my mother or father, or poor sisters and brothers, to say good bye,  though going away to a strange land, and might never see them again. Oh  the Buckra people who keep slaves think that black people are like cattle,  without natural affection. But my heart tells me it is far otherwise.    We were nearly four weeks on the voyage, which was unusually long.  Sometimes we had a light breeze, sometimes a great calm, and the ship made  no way; so that our provisions and water ran very low, and we were put  upon short allowance. I should almost have been starved had it not been  for the kindness of a black man called Anthony, and his wife, who had  brought their own victuals, and shared them with me.    When we went ashore at the Grand Quay, the captain sent me to the house of  my new master, Mr. D----, to whom Captain I----had sold me. Grand Quay is  a small town upon a sandbank; the houses low and built of wood. Such was  my new master's. The first person I saw, on my arrival, was Mr. D----, a  stout sulky looking man, who carried me through the hall to show me to his  wife and children. Next day I was put up by the vendue master to know how  much I was worth, and I was valued at one hundred pounds currency.    My new master was one of the owners or holders of the salt ponds, and he  received a certain sum for every slave that worked upon his premises,  whether they were young or old. This sum was allowed him out of the  profits arising from the salt works. I was immediately sent to work in the  salt water with the rest of the slaves. This work was perfectly new to me.  I was given a half barrel and a shovel, and had to stand up to my knees in  the water, from four o'clock in the morning till nine, when we were given  some Indian corn boiled in water, which we were obliged to swallow as fast  as we could for fear the rain should come on and melt the salt. We were  then called again to our tasks, and worked through the heat of the day;  the sun flaming upon our heads like fire, and raising salt blisters in  those parts which were not completely covered. Our feet and legs, from  standing in the salt water for so many hours, soon became full of dreadful  boils, which eat down in some cases to the very bone, afflicting the  sufferers with great torment. We came home at twelve; ate our corn soup,  called _blawly_, as fast as we could, and went back to our employment till  dark at night. We then shovelled up the salt in large heaps, and went down  to the sea, where we washed the pickle from our limbs, and cleaned the  barrows and shovels from the salt. When we returned to the house, our  master gave us each our allowance of raw Indian corn, which we pounded in  a mortar and boiled in water for our suppers.    We slept in a long shed, divided into narrow slips, like the stalls used  for cattle. Boards fixed upon stakes driven into the ground, without mat  or covering, were our only beds. On Sundays, after we had washed the salt  bags, and done other work required of us, we went into the bush and cut  the long soft grass, of which we made trusses for our legs and feet to  rest upon, for they were so full of the salt boils that we could get no  rest lying upon the bare boards.    Though we worked from morning till night, there was no satisfying Mr.  D----. I hoped, when I left Capt. I----, that I should have been better  off, but I found it was but going from one butcher to another. There was  this difference between them: my former master used to beat me while  raging and foaming with passion; Mr. D---- was usually quite calm. He  would stand by and give orders for a slave to be cruelly whipped, and  assist in the punishment, without moving a muscle of his face; walking  about and taking snuff with the greatest composure. Nothing could touch  his hard heart--neither sighs, nor tears, nor prayers, nor streaming  blood; he was deaf to our cries, and careless of our sufferings. Mr. D----  has often stripped me naked, hung me up by the wrists, and beat me with  the cow-skin, with his own hand, till my body was raw with gashes. Yet  there was nothing very remarkable in this; for it might serve as a sample  of the common usage of the slaves on that horrible island.    Owing to the boils in my feet, I was unable to wheel the barrow fast  through the sand, which got into the sores, and made me stumble at every  step; and my master, having no pity for my sufferings from this cause,  rendered them far more intolerable, by chastising me for not being able to  move so fast as he wished me. Another of our employments was to row a  little way off from the shore in a boat, and dive for large stones to  build a wall round our master's house. This was very hard work; and the  great waves breaking over us continually, made us often so giddy that we  lost our footing, and were in danger of being drowned.    Ah, poor me!--my tasks were never ended. Sick or well, it was  work--work--work!--After the diving season was over, we were sent to the  South Creek, with large bills, to cut up mangoes to burn lime with. Whilst  one party of slaves were thus employed, another were sent to the other  side of the island to break up coral out of the sea.    When we were ill, let our complaint be what it might, the only medicine  given to us was a great bowl of hot salt water, with salt mixed with it,  which made us very sick. If we could not keep up with the rest of the gang  of slaves, we were put in the stocks, and severely flogged the next  morning. Yet, not the less, our master expected, after we had thus been  kept from our rest, and our limbs rendered stiff and sore with ill usage,  that we should still go through the ordinary tasks of the day all the  same.--Sometimes we had to work all night, measuring salt to load a  vessel; or turning a machine to draw water out of the sea for the  salt-making. Then we had no sleep--no rest--but were forced to work as  fast as we could, and go on again all next day the same as usual.  Work--work--work--Oh that Turk's Island was a horrible place! The people  in England, I am sure, have never found out what is carried on there.  Cruel, horrible place!    Mr. D---- had a slave called old Daniel, whom he used to treat in the most  cruel manner. Poor Daniel was lame in the hip, and could not keep up with  the rest of the slaves; and our master would order him to be stripped and  laid down on the ground, and have him beaten with a rod of rough briar  till his skin was quite red and raw. He would then call for a bucket of  salt, and fling upon the raw flesh till the man writhed on the ground like  a worm, and screamed aloud with agony. This poor man's wounds were never  healed, and I have often seen them full of maggots, which increased his  torments to an intolerable degree. He was an object of pity and terror to  the whole gang of slaves, and in his wretched case we saw, each of us, our  own lot, if we should live to be as old.    Oh the horrors of slavery!--How the thought of it pains my heart! But the  truth ought to be told of it; and what my eyes have seen I think it is my  duty to relate; for few people in England know what slavery is. I have  been a slave--I have felt what a slave feels, and I know what a slave  knows; and I would have all the good people in England to know it too,  that they may break our chains, and set us free.    Mr. D---- had another slave called Ben. He being very hungry, stole a  little rice one night after he came in from work, and cooked it for his  supper. But his master soon discovered the theft; locked him up all night;  and kept him without food till one o'clock the next day. He then hung Ben  up by his hands, and beat him from time to time till the slaves came in at  night. We found the poor creature hung up when we came home; "]]]
