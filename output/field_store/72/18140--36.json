When through delights, or through pains which some power of ours  may experience, the soul is all concentrated thereon, it seems  that to no other faculty it may attend; and this is counter to  the error which believes that one soul above another is kindled  in us.[1] And therefore, when a thing is heard or seen, which may  hold the soul intently turned to it, the time passes, and the man  observes it not: for one faculty is that which listens, and  another is that which keeps the soul entire; the latter is as it  were bound, and the former is loosed.    [1] Were it true that, as according to the Platonists, there were  more than one soul in man, he might give attention to two things  at once. But when one faculty is free and called into activity,  the rest of the soul is as it were bound in inaction.      Of this had I true experience, hearing that spirit and wondering;  for full fifty degrees had the sun ascended,[1] and I had not  noticed it, when we came where those souls all together cried out  to us, \"Here is what you ask.\"    [1] It was now about nine o'clock A. M.      A larger opening the man of the farm often hedges up with a  forkful of his thorns, when the  grape grows dark, than was the  passage through which my Leader and I behind ascended alone, when  the troop departed from us. One goes to Sanleo, and descends to  Noli, one mounts up Bismantova[1] to its peak, with only the  feet; but here it behoves that one fly, I mean with the swift  wings and with the feathers of great desire, behind that guide  who gave me hope and made a light for me. We ascended in through  the broken rock, and on each side the border pressed on us, and  the ground beneath required both feet and hands.    [1] These all are places difficult of access.      When we were upon the upper edge of the high bank on the open  slope, \"My Master,\" said I, \"what way shall we take?\" And he to  me, \"Let no step of thine fall back, always win up the mountain  behind me, till some sage guide appear for us.\"    The summit was so high it surpassed the sight and the side  steeper far than a line from the mid quadrant to the centre.[1] I  was weary, when I began, \"O sweet Father, turn and regard howl  remain alone if thou dost not stop.\" \"My son,\" said he, \"far as  here drag thyself,\" pointing me to a ledge a little above, which  on that side circles all the hill. His words so spurred me, that  I forced myself, scrambling after him, until the belt was beneath  my feet. There we both sat down, turning to the east, whence we  had ascended, for to look back is wont to encourage one. I first  turned my eyes to the low shores, then I raised them to the sun,  and wondered that on the left we were struck by it. The Poet  perceived clearly that I was standing all bewildered at the  chariot of the light, where between us and Aquilo,[2] it was  entering. Whereupon he to me, \"If Castor and Pollux were in  company with that mirror [3] which up and down guides with its  light, thou wouldst see the ruddy Zodiac revolving still closer  to the Bears, if it went not out of its old road.[4] How that may  be, if thou wishest to be able to think, collected in thyself  imagine Zion and this mountain to stand upon the earth so that  both have one sole horizon, and different hemispheres; then thou  wilt see that the road which Phaethon, to his harm, knew not how  to drive, must needs pass on the one side of this mountain, and  on the other side of that, if thy intelligence right clearly  heeds.\" \"Surely, my Master,\" said I, \"never yet saw I so clearly,  as I now discern there where my wit seemed deficient; for the  mid-circle of the supernal motion, which is called Equator in a  certain art,[4] and which always remains between the sun and the  winter, for the reason that thou tellest, from here departs  toward the north, while the Hebrews saw it toward the warm  region. But, if it please thee, willingly I would know how far we  have to go, for the hill rises higher than my eyes can rise.\" And  he to me, \"This mountain is such, that ever at the beginning  below it is hard, and the higher one goes the less it hurts;  therefore when it shall seem so pleasant to thee that the going  up will be easy to thee as going down the current in a vessel,  then wilt thou be at the end of this path; there repose from toil  await: no more I answer, and this I know for true.\"    [1] A steeper inclination than that of an angle of forty-five  degrees.    [2] The North.    [3] The brightness of the sun is the reflection of the Divine  light.    [4] If the sun were in the sign of the Gemini instead of being in  Aries it would make the Zodiac ruddy still farther to the north.  In Purgatory the sun being seen from south of the equator is on  the left hand, while at Jerusalem, in the northern hemisphere, it  is seen on the right.    [5] Astronomy.      And when he had said his word, a voice near by sounded,  \"Perchance thou wilt be first constrained to sit.\" At the sound  of it each of us turned, and we saw at the left a great stone  which neither he nor I before had noticed. Thither we drew; and  there were persons who were staying in the shadow behind the  rock, as one through indolence sets himself to stay. And one of  them, who seemed to me weary, was seated, and was clasping his  knees, holding his face down low between them. \"O sweet my Lord,\"  said I, \"look at him who shows himself more indolent than if  sloth were his sister.\" Then that one turned to us and gave heed,  moving his look only up along his thigh, and said, \"Now go up  thou, for thou art valiant.\" I recognized then who he was, and  that effort which was still quickening my breath a little  hindered not my going to him, and after I had reached him, he  scarce raised his head, saying, \"Hast thou clearly seen how the  sun over thy left shoulder drives his chariot?\"    His slothful acts and his short words moved my lips a little to a  smile, then I began, \"Belacqua,[1] I do not grieve for thee  now,[2] but tell me why just here thou art seated? awaitest thou  a guide, or has only thy wonted mood recaptured thee?\" And he,  \"Brother, what imports the going up? For the bird of God that  sitteth at the gate would not let me go to the torments. It first  behoves that heaven circle around me outside the gate, as long as  it did in life, because I delayed good sighs until the end;  unless the prayer first aid me which rises up from a heart that  lives in grace: what avails the other which is not heard in  heaven?\"    [1] Belacqua, according to Benvenuto da Imola, was a Florentine,  a maker of citherns and other musical instruments; he carved with  great care the necks and heads of his citherns, and sometimes he  played on them. Dante, because of his love of music, had been  well acquainted with him.    [2] He had feared lest Belacqua might be in Hell.      And now the Poet in front of me was ascending, and he said, \"Come  on now: thou seest that the meridian is touched by the sun, and  on the shore the night now covers with her foot Morocco.\"        CANTO V. Ante-Purgatory.--Spirits who had delayed repentance, and  met with death by violence, but died repentant.--Jacopo del  Cassero.--Buonconte da Montefeltro--Via de' Tolomei.      I had now parted from those shades, and was following the  footsteps of my Leader, when behind me, pointing his finger, one  cried out, \"Look, the ray seems not to shine on the left hand of  that lower one, and as if alive he seems to hear himself.\" I  turned my eyes at the sound of these words, and I saw them  watching, for marvel, only me, only me, and the light which was  broken.    \"Why is thy mind so hampered,\" said the Master, \"that thou  slackenest thy going? What matters to thee that which here is  whispered? Come after me, and let the people talk. Stand as a  tower firm, that never wags its top for blowing of the winds; for  always the man in whom thought on thought wells up removes from  himself his aim, for the force of one weakens the other.\" What  could I answer, save \"I come\"? I said it, overspread somewhat  with the color, which, at times, makes a man worthy of pardon.    And meanwhile across upon the mountain side, a little in front of  us, were coming people, singing \"Miserere,\" verse by verse. When  they observed that I gave not place for passage of the rays  through my body, they changed their song into a long and hoarse  \"Oh!\" and two of them, in form of messengers, ran to meet us, and  asked of us, \"Of your condition make us cognizant.\" And my  Master, \"Ye can go back, and report to them who sent you, that  the body of this one is true flesh. If, as I suppose, they  stopped because of seeing his shadow, enough is answered them;  let them do him honor and he may he dear to them.\"    Never did I see enkindled vapors at early night so swiftly cleave  the clear sky, nor at set of sun the clouds of August, that these  did not return up in less time; and, arrived there, they, with  the others, gave a turn toward us, like a troop that runs without  curb. \"These folk that press to us are many, and they come to  pray thee,\" said the Poet; \"wherefore still go on, and in going  listen.\" \"O soul,\" they came crying, \"that goest to be happy with  those limbs with which thou wast born, a little stay thy step;  look if thou hast ever seen any one of us, so that thou mayest  carry news of him to earth. Ah, why dost thou go on? Ah, why dost  thou not stop? We were of old all done to death by violence, and  sinners up to the last hour; then light from Heaven made us  mindful, so that both penitent and pardoning we issued forth from  life, at peace with God, who fills our hearts with the desire to  see him.\" And I, \"Although I gaze upon your faces, not one I  recognize; but if aught that I can do be pleasing to you, spirits  wellborn,[1] speak ye, and I will do it by that peace which makes  me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19962"],[0,"Piccaninnies (#4)"],[1," deeper into it, only leaving their little black heads sticking  out.    All that night they lay and watched the Great Red Enemy in his wrath  worrying and tearing their poor trees to pieces, and all next day and  the next it lasted, and then nothing was left of their beautiful bush  but a few black, ugly stumps and a great grey waste of ashes.    And from the ashes rose the smoking dense breath of the Red Enemy, and  every now and then he flashed an angry red eye. The Piccaninnies who had  lived in that part of the bush could never again return to the cool  green shades of the forest, never slide down a fern leaf, or swing on  the branches, or pick puriri berries, or pelt the morepork in the  daytime.    What could they do? Where could they go? Poor, poor little Piccaninnies!    Well, this is what they did. Having no home to go to, and finding the  water very delightful they decided to make their home in it. At first  they would only stay timidly near the edges where the water was not  deep, but by-and-by through living entirely in the water they grew  webbed-toes (you try it!) and became as much at home in the swamp as any  other water-creature. Some of them even grew elegant little tails  (believe me or not, as you choose!) and they became known in the swamp  as the Teenywiggles, and some day you may hear something more of the  doings of the Teenywiggles.             *       *       *       *       *      Charming Booklets by Isabel Maud Peacocke (illustrated by Trevor Lloyd)      Piccaninnies    a bewitchingly fanciful and humorous fairy story in a setting of New  Zealand plant and bird life. 1/6      Bonny Books of Humorous Verse    These two booklets of amusing verses on topics peculiar to childhood  will delight both young and old. 1/6    Miss Peacocke's quaint humour is delightfully engaging, and Mr. Lloyd's  drawings are no less droll and pleasing.           *       *       *       *       *    Dainty Booklets by Edith Howes (illustrated by Alice Poison)      Wonderwings, and other Fairy Stories    Three entrancing fairy stories by New Zealand's popular author of  juvenile literature. 1/6      Little Make-Believe    a companion booklet to \"Wonderwings,\" also containing three delightful  fairy stories. 1/6    Miss Howes's stories are at once entertaining and uplifting.
