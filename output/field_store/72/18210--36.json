Vasantasena confesses to her  maid Madanika her love for Charudatta. Then a shampooer appears  in the street, pursued by the gambling-master and a gambler, who  demand of him ten gold-pieces which he has lost in the gambling-house.  At this point Darduraka enters, and engages the gambling-master  and the gambler in an angry discussion, during which the  shampooer escapes into Vasantasena's house. When Vasantasena  learns that the shampooer had once served Charudatta, she pays his  debt; the grateful shampooer resolves to turn monk. As he leaves  the house he is attacked by a runaway elephant, and saved by  Karnapuraka, a servant of Vasantasena.    ACT III., entitled _The Hole in the Wall_. The night following the  second day.--Charudatta and Maitreya return home after midnight  from a concert, and go to sleep. Maitreya has in his hand the  gem-casket which Vasantasena has left behind. Sharvilaka enters.  He is in love with Madanika, a maid of Vasantasena's, and is  resolved to acquire by theft the means of buying her freedom. He  makes a hole in the wall of the house, enters, and steals the casket  of gems which Vasantasena had left. Charudatta wakes to find  casket and thief gone. His wife gives him her pearl necklace with  which to make restitution.    ACT IV., entitled _Madanika and Sharvilaka_. Third day.--Sharvilaka  comes to Vasantasena's house to buy Madanika's freedom.  Vasantasena overhears the facts concerning the theft of her gem-casket  from Charudatta's house, but accepts the casket, and gives  Madanika her freedom. As Sharvilaka leaves the house, he hears  that his friend Aryaka, who had been imprisoned by the king, has  escaped and is being pursued. Sharvilaka departs to help him.  Maitreya comes from Charudatta with the pearl necklace, to repay  Vasantasena for the gem-casket. She accepts the necklace also, as  giving her an excuse for a visit to Charudatta.    ACT V., entitled _The Storm_. Evening of the third day.--Charudatta  appears in the garden of his house. Here he receives a servant  of Vasantasena, who announces that Vasantasena is on her  way to visit him. Vasantasena then appears in the street with the  courtier; the two describe alternately the violence and beauty of the  storm which has suddenly arisen. Vasantasena dismisses the courtier,  enters the garden, and explains to Charudatta how she has  again come into possession of the gem-casket. Meanwhile, the storm  has so increased in violence that she is compelled to spend the night  at Charudatta's house.    ACT VI., entitled _The Swapping of the Bullock-carts_. Morning of  the fourth day.--Here she meets Charudatta's little son, Rohasena.  The boy is peevish because he can now have only a little clay cart  to play with, instead of finer toys. Vasantasena gives him her  gems to buy a toy cart of gold. Charudatta's servant drives up to  take Vasantasena in Charudatta's bullock-cart to the park, where  she is to meet Charudatta; but while Vasantasena is making ready,  he drives away to get a cushion. Then Sansthanaka's servant drives  up with his master's cart, which Vasantasena enters by mistake.  Soon after, Charudatta's servant returns with his cart. Then the  escaped prisoner Aryaka appears and enters Charudatta's cart.  Two policemen come on the scene; they are searching for Aryaka.  One of them looks into the cart and discovers Aryaka, but agrees  to protect him. This he does by deceiving and finally maltreating  his companion.    ACT VII., entitled _Aryaka's Escape_. Fourth day.--Charudatta  is awaiting Vasantasena in the park. His cart, in which Aryaka lies  hidden, appears. Charudatta discovers the fugitive, removes his  fetters, lends him the cart, and leaves the park.    ACT VIII., entitled _The Strangling of Vasantasena_. Fourth  day.--A Buddhist monk, the shampooer of the second act, enters  the park. He has difficulty in escaping from Sansthanaka, who  appears with the courtier. Sansthanaka's servant drives in with the  cart which Vasantasena had entered by mistake. She is discovered  by Sansthanaka, who pursues her with insulting offers of love.  When she repulses him, Sansthanaka gets rid of all witnesses,  strangles her, and leaves her for dead. The Buddhist monk enters  again, revives Vasantasena, and conducts her to a monastery.    ACT IX., entitled _The Trial_. Fifth day.--Sansthanaka accuses  Charudatta of murdering Vasantasena for her money. In the course  of the trial, it appears that Vasantasena had spent the night of the  storm at Charudatta's house; that she had left the house the next  morning to meet Charudatta in the park; that there had been a  struggle in the park, which apparently ended in the murder of a  woman. Charudatta's friend, Maitreya, enters with the gems which  Vasantasena had left to buy Charudatta's son a toy cart of gold.  These gems fall to the floor during a scuffle between Maitreya and  Sansthanaka. In view of Charudatta's poverty, this seems to establish  the motive for the crime, and Charudatta is condemned to  death.    ACT X., entitled _The End_. Sixth day.--Two headsmen are conducting  Charudatta to the place of execution. Charudatta takes his last leave of  his son and his friend Maitreya. But Sansthanaka's servant escapes from  confinement and betrays the truth; yet he is not believed, owing to the  cunning displayed by his master. The headsmen are preparing to execute  Charudatta, when Vasantasena herself appears upon the scene, accompanied  by the Buddhist monk. Her appearance puts a summary end to the  proceedings. Then news is brought that Aryaka has killed and supplanted  the former king, that he wishes to reward Charudatta, and that he has by  royal edict freed Vasantasena from the necessity of living as a  courtezan. Sansthanaka is brought before Charudatta for sentence, but is  pardoned by the man whom he had so grievously injured. The play ends  with the usual Epilogue.
