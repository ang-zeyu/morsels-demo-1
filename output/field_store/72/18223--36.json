He has not drawn any  money.\"    \"P'r'aps press-gang's got him, sir,\" suggested Jem.    \"Humph!  Hardly likely!\" said Uncle Josiah; and he went on and entered  the office, to come out at the end of a few minutes and beckon to Don.    \"Lindon,\" he said, as the lad joined him, \"I left nine guineas and a  half in the little mahogany bowl in my desk yesterday.  Whom have you  paid?\"    \"Paid?  No one, sir.\"    \"But eight guineas are gone--missing.\"    \"Eight guineas?  Missing, sir?\"    \"Yes, do you know anything about them?\"    \"No, sir.  I--that is--yes, I remember now: I picked up a guinea on the  floor, and meant to give it to you.  Here it is: I forgot all about it.\"    Don took a piece of gold from his flap waistcoat pocket, and handed it  to his uncle, who looked at him so curiously that the boy grew confused.    \"Picked this up on the floor, Lindon?\" said Uncle Josiah.    \"Yes, sir.  It had rolled down by my desk.\"    \"It is very strange,\" said Uncle Josiah, thoughtfully.  \"Well, that  leaves seven missing.  You had better look round and see if you can find  them.\"    Don felt uncomfortable, he hardly knew why; but it seemed to him that  his uncle looked at him doubtingly, and this brought a feeling of hot  indignation into the boy's brain.    He turned quickly, however, entered the office, and with his uncle  looking on, searched all over the floor.    \"Well?\"    \"There's nothing here, sir.  Of course not,\" cried Don eagerly; \"Mrs  Wimble sweeps up every morning, and if there had been she would have  found it.\"    Uncle Josiah lifted off his cocked hat, and put it on again wrong way  first.    \"This is a very unpleasant affair, Lindon,\" he said.  \"I can afford to  lose seven guineas, or seven hundred if it came to that, but I can't  afford to lose confidence in those whom I employ.\"    Don felt hot and cold as his uncle walked to the door and called Jem;  and as he waited he looked at the map of an estate in the West Indies,  all fly-specked and yellow, then at the portraits of three merchant  vessels in full sail, all as yellow and fly-specked as the map, and  showing the peculiarity emphasised by the ingenious artist, of their  sails blown out one way and their house flags another.    \"Surely uncle can't suspect me,\" he said to himself; and then the  thought came again--\"surely uncle can't suspect me.\"    \"Come in here, Wimble,\" said Uncle Josiah, very sternly.    Jem took off his hat, and followed him into the office.    \"Some money is missing from my desk, Wimble.  Have you seen it?\"    \"Me, sir?\" said Jem, stooping down and peering in all directions under  the desks.  \"No, sir, I harn't seen it.  Let's see, I don't think I've  been here only when I locked up.\"    \"By some mischance I left my desk unlocked when I went out in a hurry  yesterday.  Lindon here has found one piece on the floor.\"    \"P'r'aps tothers is there, too,\" said Jem eagerly.    \"No; we have looked.  Call your wife.  Perhaps she may have found them  when sweeping.\"    \"Not she, sir,\" said Jem.  \"If she had she'd ha' told me.  'Sides, how  could they ha' got on the floor?\"    \"That remains to be proved, Wimble,\" said Uncle Josiah, drily.  \"Call  your wife.\"    Jem went to the door, rubbing his ear, and as it happened, seeing his  wife outside the cottage, telegraphed to her to come by working one arm  about furiously.    Little Mrs Wimble came up in a hurry, looking scared.    \"Take off that there dirty apron,\" whispered Jem, making a dash at the  offending garment, and snatching back his hand bleeding from the scratch  of the pin by which it was fastened.    \"Look at that,\" he began.    \"Then you shouldn't--\"    \"Silence!\" said Uncle Josiah.  \"Mrs Wimble, did you sweep up this room  to-day?\"    \"That I did, sir, and dusted too, and if there's any dust, it must be  an--\"    \"Hush!  Don't talk so.  Listen to me.  Did you find any money on the  floor?\"    \"Sakes alive, sir, no.\"    \"You are quite sure?\"    \"Oh yes, sir, quite sure.  Have you dropped anything?\"    \"Yes!  No!  That will do.\"    Mrs Wimble stared.    \"Don't you hear?\" whispered Jem.  \"Be off!\"    The little woman gave him an angry look, and then hurried from the  office, looking put out and hurt.    \"This money must be found,\" said Uncle Josiah sternly, as soon as they  were alone.  \"You are sure that you have seen no more, Lindon?\"    \"Quite, uncle.  I'm sorry I forgot about the guinea I found.\"    \"Yes!\" said Uncle Josiah, giving him a quick searching look.  \"You are  quite certain, Wimble?\"    \"Me, sir?  Oh, yes; I'm moral sartain.\"    \"I should be sorry to suspect any one, and behave unjustly, but I must  have this matter cleared up.  Michael Bannock is away, and I cannot  conceive his being absent without money, unless he is ill.  Wimble, go  and see.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said the yard-man, with alacrity; and he went off shaking  his head, as if all this was a puzzle beyond his capacity to comprehend.    \"You had better go to your desk, Lindon,\" said Uncle Josiah, coldly.    Don started, and mounted his stool, but he could not write.  His brain  was confused; and from time to time he glanced at the stern-looking old  merchant, and tried to grasp his thoughts.  \"Surely uncle can't suspect  me--surely he can't suspect me!\" he found himself saying again, and the  trouble seemed to increase till he felt as if he must speak out and say  how sorry he was that he had picked up the money and forgotten all about  it, when Jem returned.    \"He arn't ill, sir,\" said the man eagerly, \"I found him close by, at the  Little Half Moon, in the back street.\"    \"Drinking?\"    \"Yes, sir, and treating a lot of his mates.  He wanted me to have some,  and when I wouldn't, he said I should, and emptied half a glass over me.  See here.\"    He held up one of his broad skirts which was liberally splashed.    Uncle Josiah frowned, and took a turn or two up and down the office.  Then he stopped before Jem.    \"Go round to Smithers the constable.  You know: the man who came when  the rum was broached.\"    \"Yes, sir, I know.\"    \"Ask Smithers to bring Michael Bannock round here.  I must clear this  matter up.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Jem; and he hurried out, while Don drew a long breath.    \"Uncle does not suspect me,\" he said to himself.  \"The scoundrel!  He  must have taken advantage of your back being turned to come in here.  You did not notice anything, Lindon?\"    \"No, uncle, and I hardly think he could have been left alone.\"    \"But the money is missing; some of it was dropped; this man is always  penniless; he has not drawn his wages, and yet he is half tipsy and  treating his companions.  I hope I am not suspecting him wrongfully, but  it looks bad, Lindon, it looks bad.\"    The old merchant sat down and began to write.  So did Don, who felt  better now, and the time glided on till there were the sounds of feet  heard in the yard, and directly after Mike, looking very red-eyed and  flushed, entered the office, half pushed in by Jem Wimble and a  hard-faced ugly man, who had a peculiar chip out of, or dent in, his  nose.    \"Morn', master,\" said Mike, boisterously.  \"Couldn't yer get on without  yer best man i' th' yard?\"    \"Silence, sir!\" cried Uncle Josiah, turning round, and glaring  magisterially at the culprit.    \"Take yer hat off, can't yer?\" cried Jem, knocking it off for him, and  then picking it up and handing it.    \"Give man time, Jem Wimble,\" said Mike, with a grimace.  \"Want to pay me  what you owes me, master?\"    \"Hold your tongue, sir!  And listen.  Constable, a sum of money has been  abstracted from my desk, and this man, who I believe was penniless two  days ago, is now staying away from his work treating his friends.\"    \"Steady, master; on'y having a glass.\"    \"He was paying for ale with a guinea when I fetched him out, sir,\" said  the constable.  \"Now, Mike, you're wanted for another ugly job, so you  may as well clear yourself of this if you can.\"    \"What yer mean with your ugly job?\" said the man, laughing.    \"You'll know soon enough; you and four more are in trouble.  Now then,  what money have you got on you?\"    \"None 'tall.\"    \"Out with it.\"    \"Well, only two o' these.  I did have three,\" grumbled the man,  reluctantly taking out a couple of guineas from his pocket.    \"Looks bad, sir,\" said the constable.  \"Now then, where did you get  them?\"    \"What's that to you?\"    \"Enough for Mr Christmas to charge you with robbing his desk, my lad;  and this and what I've got against you will send you to Botany Bay.\"    \"What, me?  Rob a good master?  Not a penny.\"    \"What have you done with the rest?\" continued the constable.    \"Never had no more, and wouldn't have had that if I'd knowed.\"    \"This will do, sir,\" said the constable.  \"You charge him here with  stealing money from your desk?\"    \"I am afraid I must,\" said Uncle Josiah.    \"What, me?  Charge me?\" cried the man, angrily.    \"Yes, Bannock, reluctantly; but it seems that you are the thief.\"    \"No: not me!\" cried the man, fiercely.  \"It warn't me.  It was him.\"    Don started and turned pale, as the man stood pointing at him.    \"What do you mean?\" cried Uncle Josiah.    \"Mean?  Why, I ketched him a-helping hisself to the money, and he give  me three guineas to hold my tongue.\"    \"What?\"    \"And when I wouldn't take 'em he said if I didn't he'd say it was me;  and that's the whole truth, and nothing else.\"    \"Lindon, what have you to say to this?\" cried Uncle Josiah.    Don thought of the guinea he had picked up, of his uncle's curious look  when he gave it to him, and as he turned red and white with terror and  dismay, mingled with confusion, he tried to speak, but try how he would,  no words would come.        CHAPTER FOUR.    MIKE BANNOCK HAS A RIDE.    \"You wretch!\"    Those two words were a long time coming, but when they did escape from  Lindon's lips, they made up in emphasis and force for their brevity.    \"Steady, Master Don, steady,\" said Jem, throwing his arms"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21322"],[0,"The Tale of Betsy Butterfly (#4)"],[1,"Butterfly deceived me!\" she cried in a shrill voice. \"She was  afraid that if I knew she ate butter she would have to share it with  me.... I'd like to know where she gets her butter,\" Mrs. Ladybug mused.    \"She was standing on some of Farmer Green's, when I saw her,\" Daddy  Longlegs explained.    \"Did she ask him for it?\" Mrs. Ladybug demanded.    \"I don't believe she did,\" he admitted. \"I think she just took it.\"    A wicked gleam came into Mrs. Ladybug's eyes when she learned that. And  she threw up her hands, exclaiming, \"She steals! Betsy Butterfly steals  butter! When the field people hear the news they won't think she's so  fine.\" And then Mrs. Ladybug turned to Daddy Longlegs once more and  demanded whether he knew of anything else that Betsy Butterfly was in  the habit of taking from Farmer Green.    \"Eggs!\" he replied promptly.    \"Eggs!\" Mrs. Ladybug repeated after him. \"Betsy Butterfly steals butter  and eggs!\"    And before Daddy Longlegs could stop her she had hurried away to spread  the news far and wide.          X    THE NIGHT WATCH      LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug stopped everybody she met in the meadow and related  how Betsy Butterfly was taking Farmer Green's butter--and his eggs,  too--without asking his permission.    \"She's going to get some of us into trouble,\" Mrs. Ladybug informed her  neighbors. \"Just as likely as not Farmer Green and his wife will think  others are stealing from them. Why, I went to the farmhouse to-day and  asked for a bit of butter. And what do you think? Mrs. Green pretended  not to hear me! I thought it was queer, at the time. But now I know  that she's angry with me. She must have missed some of her butter; and  she thinks I'm the guilty party.\" Mrs. Ladybug shook her finger at her  neighbors. \"We'll have to do something to put a stop to Betsy  Butterfly's thieving,\" she declared.    Jealous Mrs. Ladybug's story amazed all the field people. They could  scarcely believe that anyone so beautiful and dainty as Betsy Butterfly  would bemean herself by robbing Farmer Green--or anybody else. But Mrs.  Ladybug said that Daddy Longlegs had _seen_ Betsy with her face buried  in Farmer Green's butter. And no one could doubt the word of so  respectable a person as Daddy Longlegs.    \"What steps do you think we ought to take to prevent Betsy from eating  any more butter and eggs that don't belong to her?\" asked the queen of  the Bumblebee family.    \"I think we ought to set a careful watch on her,\" said Mrs. Ladybug.  \"I'm sure I don't see when she gets her stolen goods, because I've  watched her very closely myself for some time. And I've seen her dine on  nothing but flowers.\"    \"Perhaps she goes to the farmhouse at night,\" Jennie Junebug suggested.    \"That's a happy thought!\" said Mrs. Ladybug approvingly. \"We'll have to  get Freddie Firefly to follow her about after dark.\"    So Mrs. Ladybug and her neighbors made arrangements with Freddie Firefly  to have Betsy Butterfly spied upon that very night.    \"I'll watch her till sunset,\" Mrs. Ladybug agreed. \"And then _you_ must  relieve me,\" she told Freddie. \"Don't let her out of your sight until  sunrise!\" she warned him.    Freddie Firefly promised that he would be faithful to his trust. And  later that afternoon, when the sun began to drop behind the mountains,  he relieved Mrs. Ladybug, who had been spying upon Betsy ever since  their talk earlier in the day.    \"She's behaved herself fairly well so far,\" Mrs. Ladybug whispered to  Freddie, as she prepared to fly home to her children. \"But there's no  knowing when she may start for the farmhouse. So you mustn't take your  eyes off her all night long!\"    \"You can trust me,\" Freddie assured her. And then Mrs. Ladybug said good  evening.           *       *       *       *       *    Freddie Firefly always claimed that that was the longest night he ever  spent. And he said that if he had realized that he would have to stay in  one place from sunset to dawn he never would have agreed to watch Betsy  Butterfly.    For Betsy Butterfly went to sleep the moment the sun went down. Freddie  had to remain for hours and hours where he could flash his light upon  her. And all the while he knew that his whole family was having a  delightful time dancing in the hollow over towards the swamp.    It was especially hard for Freddie because he could see the gay lights  of the Fireflies twinkling through the dark.    But Betsy Butterfly knew nothing of his long vigil. She slept and slept  the whole night long. And Freddie Firefly had to admit to himself, as he  watched her, that she didn't _act_ like a robber in the least.          XI    A SLY ONE      WHEN Freddie Firefly reported to Mrs. Ladybug and her neighbors that  Betsy Butterfly had taken neither butter nor eggs from Farmer Green  during the night the field people were much puzzled.    \"She's certainly a sly one!\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed. \"What do you think  we ought to do now?\" she asked Daddy Longlegs, who was supposed to be  very old, and therefore very wise.    \"I think you ought to warn her,\" he replied, after some thought. \"You  ought to tell Betsy Butterfly that she must stop pilfering.\"    \"No doubt your advice is good,\" Mrs. Ladybug observed. \"And I'll speak  to Betsy this very morning.... You must come with me,\" she told Daddy.  \"I naturally want to have a witness.\"    \"Oh, I'll come!\" he cried in his thin, quavering voice, though what she  meant by a \"witness\" was more than he knew.    So Mrs. Ladybug and Daddy Longlegs set forth to find Betsy Butterfly.  And behind them followed a crowd of their neighbors. Even lazy Buster  Bumblebee joined the procession. Though he was a drone, and never  worked, he was always ready to exert himself for the sake of any new  excitement.    The strange company wandered back and forth across the meadow for some  time without finding Betsy Butterfly. But at last Mrs. Ladybug spied  her. And soon Betsy found herself surrounded by the mob.    \"Goodness!\" she cried, looking about her in surprise. \"How nice of you  all to call on me! I'm _so_ glad to see you!\"    Betsy Butterfly was so cordial that Mrs. Ladybug couldn't help looking  somewhat uncomfortable. She couldn't avoid a strange feeling of guilt.  And yet she told herself that Betsy Butterfly was really the guilty one.    \"She's a bold piece!\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed, under her breath.    \"Perhaps you won't be so happy to see us when you hear what we have to  say to you,\" Mrs. Ladybug began.    \"There hasn't been an accident, I hope!\" Betsy cried. \"Your house hasn't  burned?\"    \"No!\" replied Mrs. Ladybug. And again she said, \"No!\" in a very decided  manner. \"We've come to warn you that we've found out about your  trickery,\" she announced. \"We know that you like butter, and that  you're in the habit of taking it from Farmer Green--yes! and eggs, too!\"    \"Why, I don't know what you're talking about!\" Betsy Butterfly faltered.  She was really greatly surprised.    \"It won't help you to be untruthful,\" Mrs. Ladybug told her severely.  \"It's no wonder--\" she added--\"it's no wonder Mrs. Green wouldn't give  me a bit of butter when I went to the farmhouse yesterday. She thought  _I_ was the one that's been stealing it from her, right along.\"    And then Mrs. Ladybug was amazed by what followed. For Betsy Butterfly  actually smiled at her.    \"You're mistaken,\" she said. \"I never eat butter. I don't like it. And  as for eggs, how could I ever break through an egg-shell?\"    \"I don't know anything about that,\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"And besides, I  didn't come here to be questioned,\" she added tartly. \"If you have any  questions to ask, just ask 'em of _him_, for he's seen you with your  face buried in butter!\" And she pointed at Daddy Longlegs.    And now it was _his_ turn to look uncomfortable. For he considered Betsy  Butterfly to be very beautiful indeed.          XII    A TERRIBLE BLUNDER      WHEN the beautiful Betsy Butterfly turned her gaze on him, Daddy  Longlegs couldn't help wishing that he had worn his new coat that day.  However, he straightened his necktie carefully and tried to look as well  as he could.    \"So you've seen me eating butter, have you?\" Betsy Butterfly asked him.    \"Not _eating_ it!\" he corrected her. \"I've seen you _standing_ on it.  And your face was hidden in it, too.\"    Mrs. Ladybug shot a triumphant glance at the crowd, of which she and  Betsy Butterfly and Daddy Longlegs were the center.    \"What have you to say now, my fine lady?\" she demanded of Betsy with a  sneer.    And still Betsy Butterfly was quite unruffled.    \"Where did you see me doing that?\" she asked Daddy Longlegs pleasantly  enough.    \"I object!\" Mrs. Ladybug interrupted hastily. \"You needn't answer her  question,\" she advised Daddy Longlegs. \"I know her tricks! She'll keep  us talking here until we forget what our errand was!\"    But Daddy Longlegs paid no attention to Mrs. Ladybug's advice.    \"I saw you in this meadow,\" he explained.    And Mrs. Ladybug began to look somewhat worried.    \"Come!\" she cried. \"Let's all go home now. We've warned her; and we'll  leave her to think over what she's done.... I hope--\" Mrs. Ladybug  added, turning to Betsy Butterfly--\"I hope you'll decide to turn over a  new leaf.\"    \"Why, that's exactly what she did, that time when I saw her!\" Daddy  Longlegs shouted. \"While I was watching her I saw her turn over a leaf.  So what's the use of her turning over another.\"    And now it was Mrs. Ladybug's turn to look amazed and bewildered.    \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" she snapped, glaring at Daddy  Longlegs. \"And I don't believe you know, yourself.\"    \"Oh! yes, I do!\" he retorted shrilly.    \"Butter has no leaves,\" said Mrs. Ladybug with a knowing air. \"I saw  heaps and heaps of it in Farmer Green's buttery yesterday. And there  wasn't a leaf on it.\"    \"How about eggs, then?\" shouted somebody in the crowd. It was stupid  Buster Bumblebee! And of course nobody paid any heed to his silly"]]]
