Perhaps he may pull  it through; anyway he is starting with a beautifully cleaned slate. He  has surpassed himself, in fact, for I confess even with past experience  to guide me, I did not imagine our machinery could have been so  thoroughly smashed in so short a time. Ten long years of General Staff;  Lyttelton, Nicholson, French, Douglas; where are your well-thought-out  schemes for an amphibious attack on Constantinople? Not a sign!  Braithwaite set to work in the Intelligence Branch at once. But beyond  the ordinary text books those pigeon holes were drawn blank. The  Dardanelles and Bosphorus might be in the moon for all the military  information I have got to go upon. One text book and one book of  travellers' tales don't take long to master and I have not been so free  from work or preoccupation since the war started. There is no use trying  to make plans unless there is some sort of material, political, naval,  military or geographical to work upon.    Winston had been in a fever to get us off and had ordered a special  train for that very afternoon. My new Staff were doubtful if they could  get fixed up so quickly and K. settled the matter by saying there was no  need to hustle. For myself, I was very keen to get away. The best plan  to save slips between cup and lip is to swallow the liquor. But K.  thought it wisest to wait, so I 'phoned over to Eddie to let Winston  know we should not want his train that day.    Next morning, the 13th, I handed over the Central Force Command to  Rundle and then, at 10.30 went in with Braithwaite to say good-bye. K.  was standing by his desk splashing about with his pen at three different  drafts of instructions. One of them had been drafted by Fitz--I suppose  under somebody's guidance; the other was by young Buckley; the third K.  was working on himself. Braithwaite, Fitz and I were in the room; no one  else except Callwell who popped in and out. The instructions went over  most of the ground of yesterday's debate and were too vague. When I  asked the crucial question:--the enemy's strength? K. thought I had  better be prepared for 40,000. How many guns? No one knows. Who was in  command? Djavad Pasha, it is believed. But, K. says, I may take it that  the Kilid Bahr Plateau has been entrenched and is sufficiently held.  South of Kilid Bahr to the point at Cape Helles, I may take it that the  Peninsula is open to a landing on very easy terms. The cross fire from  the Fleet lying part in the Aegean and part in the mouth of the Straits  must sweep that flat and open stretch of country so as to render it  untenable by the enemy. Lord K. demonstrated this cross fire upon the  map. He toiled over the wording of his instructions. They were headed  \"Constantinople Expeditionary Force.\" I begged him to alter this to  avert Fate's evil eye. He consented and both this corrected draft and  the copy as finally approved are now in Braithwaite's despatch box more  modestly headed \"Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.\" None of the drafts  help us with facts about the enemy; the politics; the country and our  allies, the Russians. In sober fact these \"instructions\" leave me to my  own devices in the East, almost as much as K.'s laconic order \"git\" left  me to myself when I quitted Pretoria for the West thirteen years ago.    So I said good-bye to old K. as casually as if we were to meet together  at dinner. Actually my heart went out to my old Chief. He was giving me  the best thing in his gift and I hated to leave him amongst people who  were frightened of him. But there was no use saying a word. He did not  even wish me luck and I did not expect him to, but he did say, rather  unexpectedly, _after_ I had said good-bye and just as I was taking up my  cap from the table, \"If the Fleet gets through, Constantinople will fall  of itself and you will have won, not a battle, but the war.\"    At 5 o'clock that afternoon we bade adieu to London. Winston was  disappointed we didn't dash away yesterday but we have not really let  much grass grow under our feet. He and some friends came down to Charing  Cross to see us off. I told Winston Lord K. would not think me loyal if  I wrote to another Secretary of State. He understood and said that if I  wanted him to be aware of some special request all I had to say was,  \"You will agree perhaps that the First Lord should see.\" Then the S. of  S. for War would be bound to show him the letter:--which proves that  with all his cleverness Winston has yet some points to learn about his  K. of K.!    My Staff still bear the bewildered look of men who have hurriedly been  snatched from desks to do some extraordinary turn on some unheard of  theatre. One or two of them put on uniform for the first time in their  lives an hour ago. Leggings awry, spurs upside down, belts over shoulder  straps! I haven't a notion of who they all are: nine-tenths of my few  hours of warning has been taken up in winding up the affairs of the  Central Force.    At Dover embarked on H.M.S. _Foresight_,--a misnomer, for we ran into a  fog and had to lie-to for a devil of a time. Heard far-off guns on  French front,--which was cheering.    At 10.30 p.m. we left Calais for Marseilles and during the next day the  French authorities caused me to be met by Officers of their Railway  Mobilization Section. Had my first breathing space wherein to talk over  matters with Braithwaite, and he and I tried to piece together the  various scraps of views we had picked up at the War Office into a  pattern which should serve us for a doctrine. But we haven't got very  much to go upon. A diagram he had drawn up with half the spaces unfilled  showing the General Staff. Another diagram with its blank spaces only  showed that our Q. branch was not in being. Three queried names,  Woodward for A.G., Winter for Q.M.G. and Williams for Cipher Officer.  The first two had been left behind, the third was with us. The following  hurried jottings by Braithwaite:--\"Only 1600 rounds for the 4.5  Howitzers!!! High Explosive essential. Who is to be C.R.E.? Engineer  Stores? French are to remain at Tunis until the day comes that they are  required. Egyptian troops also remain in Egypt till last moment.  Everything we want by 30th (it is hoped). Await arrival of 29th Division  before undertaking anything big. If Carden wants military help it is for  Sir Ian's consideration whether to give or to withhold it.\" These rough  notes; the text book on the Turkish Army, and two small guide books: not  a very luminous outfit. Braithwaite tells me our force are not to take  with them the usual 10 per cent. extra margin of reserves to fill  casualties. Wish I had realised this earlier. He had not time to tell  me he says. The General Staff thought we ought certainly to have these  and he and Wolfe Murray went in and made a personal appeal to the A.G.  But he was obdurate. This seems hard luck. Why should we not have our  losses quickly replaced--supposing we do lose men? I doubt though, if I  should have been able to do very much even if I had known. To press K.  would have been difficult. Like insisting on an extra half-crown when  you've just been given Fortunatus' purse. Still, fair play's a jewel,  and surely if formations destined for the French front cross the Channel  with 10 per cent. extra, over and above their establishment, troops  bound for Constantinople ought to have a 25 per cent. margin over  establishment?    _17th March, 1915. H.M.S. \"Phaeton.\" At sea._ Last night we raced past  Corfu--my birthplace--at thirty knots an hour. My first baby breath was  drawn from these thyme scented breezes. This crimson in the Eastern sky,  these waves of liquid opal are natal, vital.    Thirty miles an hour through Paradise! Since the 16th January, 1853, we  have learnt to go the pace and as a result the world shrinks; the  horizons close in upon us; the spacious days are gone!    Thoughts of my Mother, who died when I was but three. Thoughts of her  refusal as she lay dying--gasping in mortal pain--her refusal to touch  an opiate, because the Minister, Norman Macleod, had told her she so  might dim the clearness of her spiritual insight--of her thoughts  ascending heavenwards. What pluck--what grit--what faith--what an  example to a soldier.    Exquisite, exquisite air; sea like an undulating carpet of blue velvet  outspread for Aphrodite. Have been in the Aegean since dawn. At noon  passed a cruiser taking back Admiral Carden invalided to Malta. One week  ago the thunder of his guns shook the firm foundations of the world. Now  a sheer hulk lies poor old Carden. _Vanitas vanitatum_.    Have got into touch with my staff. They are all General Staff: no  Administrative Staff. The Adjutant-General-to-be (I don't know him) and  the Chief Medico (I don't know who he is to be) could not get ready in  time to come off with us, and the Q.M.G., too, was undecided when I  left. There are nine of the General Staff. I like the looks of them.  Quite characteristic of K., though, that barring Braithwaite, not one of  the associates he has told off to work hand in glove with me in this  enterprise should ever have served with me before.    Only two sorts of Commanders-in-Chief could possibly find time to  scribble like this on their way to take up an enterprise in many ways  unprecedented--a German and a Britisher. The first, because every  possible contingency would have been worked out for him beforehand; the  second, because he has nothing--literally nothing--in his portfolio  except a blank cheque signed with those grand yet simple words--John  Bull. The German General is the product of an organising nation. The  British General is the product of an improvising nation. Each army would  be better commanded by the other army's General.

There were heroes before Agamemnon;  there will be Bachs after Johann Sebastian. And beneath the Judaized  plutocracy, the sublimated _bourgeoisie_, there the immemorial  proletariat, I venture to guess, will roar on, endlessly tortured by its  vain hatreds and envies, stampeded and made to tremble by its ancient  superstitions, prodded and made miserable by its sordid and degrading  hopes. It seems to me very likely that, in this proletariat,  Christianity will continue to survive. It is nonsense, true enough, but  it is sweet. Nietzsche, denouncing its dangers as a poison, almost falls  into the error of denying it its undoubtedly sugary smack. Of all the  religions ever devised by the great practical jokers of the race, this  is the one that offers most for the least money, so to speak, to the  inferior man. It starts out by denying his inferiority in plain terms:  _all_ men are equal in the sight of God. It ends by erecting that  inferiority into a sort of actual superiority: it is a merit to be  stupid, and miserable, and sorely put upon--of such are the celestial  elect. Not all the eloquence of a million Nietzsches, nor all the  painful marshalling of evidence of a million Darwins and Harnacks, will  ever empty that great consolation of its allure. The most they can ever  accomplish is to make the superior orders of men acutely conscious of  the exact nature of it, and so give them armament against the contagion.  This is going on; this is being done. I think that \"The Antichrist\" has  a useful place in that enterprise. It is strident, it is often  extravagant, it is, to many sensitive men, in the worst of possible  taste, but at bottom it is enormously apt and effective--and on the  surface it is undoubtedly a good show. One somehow enjoys, with the  malice that is native to man, the spectacle of anathemas batted back; it  is refreshing to see the pitchfork employed against gentlemen who have  doomed such innumerable caravans to hell. In Nietzsche they found, after  many long years, a foeman worthy of them--not a mere fancy swordsman  like Voltaire, or a mob orator like Tom Paine, or a pedant like the  heretics of exegesis, but a gladiator armed with steel and armoured with  steel, and showing all the ferocious gusto of a mediaeval bishop. It is  a pity that Holy Church has no process for the elevation of demons, like  its process for the canonization of saints. There must be a long roll of  black miracles to the discredit of the Accursed Friedrich--sinners  purged of conscience and made happy in their sinning, clerics shaken in  their theology by visions of a new and better holy city, the strong made  to exult, the weak robbed of their old sad romance. It would be a  pleasure to see the _Advocatus Diaboli_ turn from the table of the  prosecution to the table of the defence, and move in solemn form for the  damnation of the Naumburg hobgoblin....    Of all Nietzsche's books, \"The Antichrist\" comes nearest to  conventionality in form. It presents a connected argument with very few  interludes, and has a beginning, a middle and an end. Most of his works  are in the form of collections of apothegms, and sometimes the subject  changes on every second page. This fact constitutes one of the counts in  the orthodox indictment of him: it is cited as proof that his capacity  for consecutive thought was limited, and that he was thus deficient  mentally, and perhaps a downright moron. The argument, it must be  obvious, is fundamentally nonsensical. What deceives the professors is  the traditional prolixity of philosophers. Because the average  philosophical writer, when he essays to expose his ideas, makes such  inordinate drafts upon the parts of speech that the dictionary is almost  emptied these defective observers jump to the conclusion that his  intrinsic notions are of corresponding weight. This is not unseldom  quite untrue. What makes philosophy so garrulous is not the profundity  of philosophers, but their lack of art; they are like physicians who  sought to cure a slight hyperacidity by giving the patient a carload of  burned oyster-shells to eat. There is, too, the endless poll-parrotting  that goes on: each new philosopher must prove his learning by  laboriously rehearsing the ideas of all previous philosophers....  Nietzsche avoided both faults. He always assumed that his readers knew  the books, and that it was thus unnecessary to rewrite them. And, having  an idea that seemed to him to be novel and original, he stated it in as  few words as possible, and then shut down. Sometimes he got it into a  hundred words; sometimes it took a thousand; now and then, as in the  present case, he developed a series of related ideas into a connected  book. But he never wrote a word too many. He never pumped up an idea to  make it appear bigger than it actually was. The pedagogues, alas, are  not accustomed to that sort of writing in serious fields. They resent  it, and sometimes they even try to improve it. There exists, in fact, a  huge and solemn tome on Nietzsche by a learned man of America in which  all of his brilliancy is painfully translated into the windy phrases of  the seminaries. The tome is satisfactorily ponderous, but the meat of  the cocoanut is left out: there is actually no discussion of the  Nietzschean view of Christianity!... Always Nietzsche daunts the  pedants. He employed too few words for them--and he had too many ideas.           *       *       *       *       *    The present translation of \"The Antichrist\" is published by agreement  with Dr. Oscar Levy, editor of the English edition of Nietzsche. There  are two earlier translations, one by Thomas Common and the other by  Anthony M. Ludovici. That of Mr. Common follows the text very closely,  and thus occasionally shows some essentially German turns of phrase;  that of Mr. Ludovici is more fluent but rather less exact. I do not  offer my own version on the plea that either of these is useless; on the  contrary, I cheerfully acknowledge that they have much merit, and that  they helped me at almost every line. I began this new Englishing of the  book, not in any hope of supplanting them, and surely not with any  notion of meeting a great public need, but simply as a private amusement  in troubled days. But as I got on with it I began to see ways of putting  some flavour of Nietzsche's peculiar style into the English, and so  amusement turned into a more or less serious labour. The result, of  course, is far from satisfactory, but it at least represents a very  diligent attempt. Nietzsche, always under the influence of French  models, wrote a German that differs materially from any other German  that I know. It is more nervous, more varied, more rapid in tempo; it  runs to more effective climaxes; it is never stodgy. His marks begin to  show upon the writing of the younger Germans of today. They are getting  away from the old thunderous manner, with its long sentences and its  tedious grammatical complexities. In the course of time, I daresay, they  will develop a German almost as clear as French and almost as colourful  and resilient as English.    I owe thanks to Dr. Levy for his _imprimatur_, to Mr. Theodor Hemberger  for criticism, and to Messrs. Common and Ludovici for showing me the way  around many a difficulty.

It is possible that they may be among those who understand my  \"Zarathustra\": how _could_ I confound myself with those who are now  sprouting ears?--First the day after tomorrow must come for me. Some men  are born posthumously.    The conditions under which any one understands me, and _necessarily_  understands me--I know them only too well. Even to endure my  seriousness, my passion, he must carry intellectual integrity to the  verge of hardness. He must be accustomed to living on mountain tops--and  to looking upon the wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as  _beneath_ him. He must have become indifferent; he must never ask of the  truth whether it brings profit to him or a fatality to him.... He must  have an inclination, born of strength, for questions that no one has the  courage for; the courage for the _forbidden_; predestination for the  labyrinth. The experience of seven solitudes. New ears for new music.  New eyes for what is most distant. A new conscience for truths that have  hitherto remained unheard. _And_ the will to economize in the grand  manner--to hold together his strength, his enthusiasm.... Reverence for  self; love of self; absolute freedom of self....    Very well, then! of that sort only are my readers, my true readers, my  readers foreordained: of what account are the _rest_?--The rest are  merely humanity.--One must make one's self superior to humanity, in  power, in _loftiness_ of soul,--in contempt.
