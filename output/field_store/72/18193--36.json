A shadow on a sun-baked rock sent the Terran skidding for  cover until he saw that it was cast by one of the questing falcons from  the upper peaks. But that shook his confidence, so he again sought  cover, ashamed at his own carelessness.    In the late afternoon he reached the far end of the plateau, faced a  climb to peaks which still bore cones of snow, now tinted a soft peach  by the sun. Shann studied that possible path and distrusted his own  powers to take it without proper equipment or supplies. He must turn  either north or south, though he would then have to abandon a sure water  supply in the stream. Tonight he would camp where he was. He had not  realized how tired he was until he found a likely half-cave in the  mountain wall and crawled in. There was too much danger in fire here; he  would have to do without that first comfort of his kind.    Luckily, the wolverines squeezed in beside him to fill the hole. With  their warm furred bodies sandwiching him, Shann dozed, awoke, and dozed  again, listening to night sounds--the screams, cries, hunting calls, of  the Warlock wilds. Now and again one of the wolverines whined and moved  uneasily.    Fingers of sun picked at Shann through a shaft among the rocks, striking  his eyes. He moved, blinked blearily awake, unable for the first few  seconds to understand why the smooth plasta wall of his bunk had become  rough red stone. Then he remembered. He was alone and he threw himself  frantically out of the cave, afraid the wolverines had wandered off.  Only both animals were busy clawing under a boulder with a steady  persistence which argued there was a purpose behind that effort.    A sharp sting on the back of one hand made that purpose only too clear  to Shann, and he retreated hurriedly from the vicinity of the  excavation. They had found an earth-wasp's burrow and were hunting  grubs, naturally arousing the rightful inhabitants to bitter resentment.    Shann faced the problem of his own breakfast. He had had the immunity  shots given to all members of the team, and he had eaten game brought in  by exploring parties and labeled \"safe.\" But how long he could keep to  the varieties of native food he knew was uncertain. Sooner or later he  must experiment for himself. Already he drank the stream water without  the aid of purifiers, and so far there had been no ill results from that  necessary recklessness. Now the stream suggested fish. But instead he  chanced upon another water inhabitant which had crawled up on land for  some obscure purpose of its own. It was a sluggish scaled thing, an easy  victim to his club, with thin, weak legs it could project at will from a  finned and armor-plated body.    Shann offered the head and guts to Togi, who had abandoned the wasp  nest. She sniffed in careful investigation and then gulped. Shann built  a small fire and seared the firm greenish flesh. The taste was flat,  lacking salt, but the food eased his emptiness. Enheartened, he started  south, hoping to find water sometime during the morning.    By noon he had his optimism justified with the discovery of a spring,  and the wolverines had brought down a slender-legged animal whose coat  was close in shade to the dusky purple of the vegetation. Smaller than a  Terran deer, its head bore, not horns, but a ridge of stiffened hair  rising in a point some twelve inches about the skull dome. Shann haggled  off some ragged steaks while the wolverines feasted in earnest,  carefully burying the head afterward.    It was when Shann knelt by the spring pool to wash that he caught the  clamor of the clak-claks. He had seen or heard nothing of the flyers  since he had left the lake valley. But from the noise now rising in an  earsplitting volume, he thought there was a sizable colony near-by and  that the inhabitants were thoroughly aroused.    He crept on his hands and knees to near-by brush cover, heading toward  the source of that outburst. If the claks were announcing a Throg  scouting party, he wanted to know it.    Lying flat, with branches forming a screen over him, the Terran gazed  out on a stretch of grassland which sloped at a fairly steep angle to  the south and which must lead to a portion of countryside well below the  level he was now traversing.    The clak-claks were skimming back and forth, shrieking their staccato  war cries. Following the erratic dashes of their flight formation,  Shann decided that whatever they railed against was on the lower level,  out of his sight from that point. Should he simply withdraw, since the  disturbance was not near him? Prudence dictated that; yet still he  hesitated.    He had no desire to travel north, or to try and scale the mountains. No,  south was his best path, and he should be very sure that route was  closed before he retreated.    Since any additional fuss the clak-claks might make on sighting him  would be undistinguished in their now general clamor, the Terran crawled  on to where tall grass provided a screen at the top of the slope. There  he stopped short, his hands digging into the earth in sudden braking  action.    Below, the ground steamed from a rocket flare-back, grasses burned away  from the fins of a small scoutship. But even as Shann rose to one knee,  his shout of welcome choked in his throat. One of those fins sank,  canting the ship crookedly, preventing any new take-off. And over the  crown of a low hill to the west swung the ominous black plate of a Throg  flyer.    The Throg ship came up in a burst of speed, and Shann waited tensely for  some countermove from the scout. Those small speedy Terran ships were  prudently provided with weapons triply deadly in proportion to their  size. He was sure that the Terran ship could hold its own against the  Throg, even eliminate the enemy. But there was no fire from the slanting  pencil of the scout. The Throg circled warily, obviously expecting a  trap. Twice it darted back in the direction from which it had come. As  it returned from its second retreat, another of its kind showed, a black  coin dot against the amber of the sky.    Shann felt sick inside. Now the Terran scout had lost any advantage and  perhaps all hope. The Throgs could box the other in, cut the downed ship  to pieces with their energy beams. He wanted to crawl away and not  witness this last disaster for his kind. But some stubborn core of will  kept him where he was.    The Throgs began to circle while beneath them the flock of clak-claks  screamed and dived at the slanting nose of the Terran ship. Then that  same slashing energy he had watched quarter the camp snapped from the  far plate across the stricken scout. The man who had piloted her, if not  dead already (which might account for the lack of defense), must have  fallen victim to that. But the Throg was going to make very sure. The  second flyer halted, remaining poised long enough to unleash a second  bolt--dazzling any watching eyes and broadcasting a vibration to make  Shann's skin crawl when the last faint ripple reached his lookout post.    What happened then the overconfident Throg was not prepared to take.  Shann cried out, burying his face on his arm, as pinwheels of scarlet  light blotted out normal sight. There was an explosion, a deafening  blast. He cowered, blind, unable to hear. Then, rubbing at his eyes, he  tried to see what had happened.    Through watery blurs he made out the Throg ship, not swinging now in  serene indifference to Warlock's gravity, but whirling end over end  across the sky as might a leaf tossed in a gust of wind. Its rim caught  against a rust-red cliff, it rebounded and crumpled. Then it came down,  smashing perhaps half a mile away from the smoking crater in which lay  the mangled wreckage of the Terran ship. The disabled scout pilot must  have played a last desperate game, making of his ship bait for a trap.    The Terran had taken one Throg with him. Shann rubbed again at his eyes,  just barely able to catch a glimpse of the second ship flashing away  westward. Perhaps it was only his impaired sight, but it appeared to him  that the Throg followed an erratic path, either as if the pilot feared  to be caught by a second shot, or because that ship had also suffered  some injury.    Acid smoke wreathed up from the valley making Shann retch and cough.  There could be no survivor from the Terran scout, and he did not believe  that any Throg had lived to crawl free of the crumpled plate. But there  would be other beetles swarming here soon. They would not dare to leave  the scene unsearched. He wondered about that scout. Had the pilot been  aiming for the Survey camp, the absence of any rider beam from there  warning him off so that he made the detour which brought him here? Or  had the Throgs tried to blast the Terran ship in the upper atmosphere,  crippling it, making this a forced landing? But at least this battle had  cost the Throgs, settling a small portion of the Terran debt for the  lost camp.    The length of time between Shann's sighting of the grounded ship and the  attack by the Throgs had been so short that he had not really developed  any strong hope of rescue to be destroyed by the end of the crippled  ship. On the other hand, seeing the Throgs take a beating had exploded  his subconscious acceptance of their superiority. He might not have even  the resources of a damaged scout at his command. But he did have Taggi,  Togi, and his own brain. Since he was fated to permanent exile on  Warlock, there might just be some way to make the beetles pay for that.    He licked his lips. Real action against the aliens would take a lot of  planning. Shann would have to know more about what made a Throg a Throg,  more than all the wild stories he had heard over the years. There _had_  to be some way a Terran could move effectively against a beetle-head.

Now will you do as I tell you? Within a couple of hours, they'll be  combing the planet for you, but by that time the ship I came in on will  have taken off again. They only stop a short time here, for mail,  passengers--no cargo. They may get under way again before all messages  are cleared and decoded.\" He stopped and breathed hard. \"The Earth  authorities might protect you, but you would never be able to board a  Lhari ship again--and that would mean staying on Earth for the rest of  your life. You've got to get away before they start comparing notes.  Here.\" His hand went into his pockets. \"For your hair. It's a dye--a  spray.\"    He pressed a button on the bulb in his hand; Bart gasped, feeling cold  wetness on his head. His own hand came away stained black.    \"Keep still.\" Briscoe said irritably. \"You'll need it at the Procyon end  of the run. Here.\" He stuck some papers into Bart's hand, then punched  some buttons on the robotcab's control. It wheeled and swerved so  rapidly that Bart fell against the fat man's shoulder.    \"Are you crazy? What are you going to do?\"    Briscoe looked straight into Bart's eyes. In his hoarse, sick voice, he  said, \"Bart, don't worry about me. It's all over for me, whatever  happens. Just remember this. What your father is doing is _worth_ doing,  and if you start stalling, arguing, demanding explanations, you can foul  up a hundred people--and kill about half of them.\"    He closed Bart's fingers roughly over the papers. The robotcab hovered  over the spaceport. \"Now listen to me, very carefully. When I stop the  cab, down below, jump out. Don't stop to say good-bye, or ask questions,  or anything else. Just get out, walk straight through the passenger door  and straight up the ramp of the ship. Show them that ticket, and get on.  Whatever happens, don't let anything stop you. Bart!\" Briscoe shook his  shoulder. \"Promise! Whatever happens, you'll _get on that ship_!\"    Bart swallowed, feeling as if he'd been shoved into a silly  cops-and-robbers game. But Briscoe's urgency had convinced him. \"Where  am I going?\"    \"All I have is a name--Raynor Three,\" Briscoe said, \"and the message  about the Eighth Color. That's all I know.\" His mouth twisted again in  that painful gasp.    The cab swooped down. Bart found his voice. \"But what then? Is Dad  there? Will I know--\"    \"I don't know any more than I've told you,\" Briscoe said. Abruptly the  robotcab came to a halt, swaying a little. Briscoe jerked the door open,  gave Bart a push, and Bart found himself stumbling out on the ramp  beside the spaceport building. He caught his balance, looked around, and  realized that the robotcab was already climbing the sky again.    Immediately before him, neon letters spelled TO PASSENGER ENTRANCE  ONLY. Bart stumbled forward. The Lhari by the gate thrust out a  disinterested claw. Bart held up what Briscoe had shoved into his hand,  only now seeing that it was a thin wallet, a set of identity papers and a  strip of pink tickets.    \"Procyon Alpha. Corridor B, straight through.\" The Lhari gestured, and  Bart went through the narrow passageway, came out at the other end, and  found himself at the very base of a curving stair that led up and up  toward a door in the side of the huge Lhari ship. Bart hesitated. In  another minute he'd be on his way to a strange sun and a strange world,  on what might well be the wild-goose chase of all time.    Passengers were crowding the steps behind him. Someone shouted suddenly,  \"Look at that!\" and someone else yelled, \"Is that guy crazy?\"    Bart looked up. A robotcab was swooping over the spaceport in wild,  crazy circles, dipping down, suddenly making a dart like an enraged wasp  at a little nest of Lhari. They ducked and scattered; the robotcab  swerved away, hovered, swooped back. This time it struck one of the  Lhari grazingly with landing gear and knocked him sprawling. Bart stood  with his mouth open, as if paralyzed.    _Briscoe! What was he doing?_    The fallen Lhari lay without moving. The robotcab moved in again, as if  for the kill, buzzing viciously overhead.    Then a beam of light arced from one of the drawn energon-ray tubes. The  robotcab glowed briefly red, then seemed to sag, sink together; then  puddled, a slag heap of molten metal, on the glassy floor of the port. A  little moan of horror came from the crowd, and Bart felt a sudden,  wrenching sickness. It had been like a game, a silly game of cops and  robbers, and suddenly it was as serious as melted death lying there on  the spaceport. _Briscoe!_    Someone shoved him and said, \"Come on, quit gawking, kid. They won't  hold the ship all day just because some nut finds a new way to commit  suicide.\"    Bart, his legs numb, walked up the ramp. Briscoe had died to give him  this chance. Now it was up to him to make it worth having.          CHAPTER THREE      At the top of the ramp, a Lhari glanced briefly at his papers, motioned  him through. Bart passed through the airlock, and into a brightly lit  corridor half full of passengers. The line was moving slowly, and for  the first time Bart had a chance to think.    He had never seen violent death before. In this civilized world, you  didn't. He knew if he thought about Briscoe, he'd start bawling like a  baby, so he swallowed hard a couple of times, set his chin, and  concentrated on the trip to Procyon Alpha. That meant this ship was  outbound on the Aldebaran run--Proxima Centauri, Sirius, Pollux,  Procyon, Capella and Aldebaran.    The line of passengers was disappearing through a doorway. A woman ahead  of Bart turned and said nervously, \"We won't be put into cold-sleep  right away, will we?\"    He reassured her, remembering his inbound trip five years ago. \"No, no.  The ship won't go into warp-drive until we're well past Pluto. It will  be several days, at least.\"    Beyond the doorway the lights dwindled, and a Mentorian interpreter took  his dark glasses, saying, \"Kindly remove your belt, shoes and other  accessories of leather or metal before stepping into the decontamination  chamber. They will be separately decontaminated and returned to you.  Papers, please.\"    With a small twinge of fright, Bart surrendered them. Would the  Mentorian ask why he was carrying two wallets? Inside the other one, he  still had his Academy ID card which identified him as Bart Steele, and  if the Mentorian looked through them to check, and found out he was  carrying two sets of identity papers....    But the Mentorian merely dumped all his pocket paraphernalia, without  looking at it, into a sack. \"Just step through here.\"    Holding up his trousers with both hands, Bart stepped inside the  indicated cubicle. It was filled with faint bluish light. Bart felt a  strong tingling and a faint electrical smell, and along his forearms  there was a slight prickling where the small hairs were all standing on  end. He knew that the invisible R-rays were killing all the  microorganisms in his body, so that no disease germ or stray fungus  would be carried from planet to planet.    The bluish light died. Outside, the Mentorian gave him back his shoes  and belt, handed him the paper sack of his belongings, and a paper cup  full of greenish fluid.    \"Drink this.\"    \"What is it?\"    The medic said patiently, \"Remember, the R-rays killed _all_ the  microorganisms in your body, including the good ones--the antibodies  that protect you against disease, and the small yeasts and bacteria that  live in your intestines and help in the digestion of your food. So we  have to replace those you need to stay healthy. See?\"    The green stuff tasted a little brackish, but Bart got it down all  right. He didn't much like the idea of drinking a solution of \"germs,\"  but he knew that was silly. There was a big difference between disease  germs and helpful bacteria.    Another Mentorian official, this one a young woman, gave him a key with  a numbered tag, and a small booklet with WELCOME ABOARD printed  on the cover.    The tag was numbered 246-B, which made Bart raise his eyebrows. B class  was normally too expensive for Bart's father's modest purse. It wasn't  quite the luxury class A, reserved for planetary governors and  ambassadors, but it was plenty luxurious. Briscoe had certainly sent him  traveling in style!    B Deck was a long corridor with oval doors; Bart found one numbered 246,  and, not surprisingly, the key opened it. It was a pleasant little  cabin, measuring at least six feet by eight, and he would evidently have  it to himself. There was a comfortably big bunk, a light that could be  turned on and off instead of the permanent glow-walls of the cheaper  class, a private shower and toilet, and a placard on the walls informing  him that passengers in B class had the freedom of the Observation Dome  and the Recreation Lounge. There was even a row of buttons dispensing  synthetic foods, in case a passenger preferred privacy or didn't want to  wait for meals in the dining hall.    A buzzer sounded and a Mentorian voice announced, \"Five minutes to Room  Check. Passengers will please remove all metal in their clothing, and  deposit in the lead drawers. Passengers will please recline in their  bunks and fasten the retaining straps before the steward arrives.  Repeat, passengers will please....\"    Bart took off his belt, stuck it and his cuff links in the drawer and  lay down. Then, in a sudden panic, he got up again. His papers as Bart  Steele were still in the sack. He got them out, and with a feeling as if  he were crossing a bridge and burning it after him, tore up every scrap  of paper that identified him as Bart Steele of Vega Four, graduate of  the Space Academy of Earth. Now, for better or worse, he was--who _was_  he? He hadn't even looked at the new papers Briscoe had given him!    He glanced through them quickly. They were"]]]
