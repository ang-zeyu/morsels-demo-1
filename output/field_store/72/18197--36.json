CHAPTER II    OXYGEN      ~History.~ The discovery of oxygen is generally attributed to the English  chemist Priestley, who in 1774 obtained the element by heating a  compound of mercury and oxygen, known as red oxide of mercury. It is  probable, however, that the Swedish chemist Scheele had previously  obtained it, although an account of his experiments was not published  until 1777. The name oxygen signifies acid former. It was given to the  element by the French chemist Lavoisier, since he believed that all  acids owe their characteristic properties to the presence of oxygen.  This view we now know to be incorrect.    ~Occurrence.~ Oxygen is by far the most abundant of all the elements. It  occurs both in the free and in the combined state. In the free state it  occurs in the air, 100 volumes of dry air containing about 21 volumes of  oxygen. In the combined state it forms eight ninths of water and nearly  one half of the rocks composing the earth's crust. It is also an  important constituent of the compounds which compose plant and animal  tissues; for example, about 66% by weight of the human body is oxygen.    ~Preparation.~ Although oxygen occurs in the free state in the atmosphere,  its separation from the nitrogen and other gases with which it is mixed  is such a difficult matter that in the laboratory it has been found more  convenient to prepare it from its compounds. The most important of the  laboratory methods are the following:    1. _Preparation from water._ Water is a compound, consisting of 11.18%  hydrogen and 88.82% oxygen. It is easily separated into these  constituents by passing an electric current through it under suitable  conditions. The process will be described in the chapter on water. While  this method of preparation is a simple one, it is not economical.    2. _Preparation from mercuric oxide._ This method is of interest, since  it is the one which led to the discovery of oxygen. The oxide, which  consists of 7.4% oxygen and 92.6% mercury, is placed in a small, glass  test tube and heated. The compound is in this way decomposed into  mercury which collects on the sides of the glass tube, forming a silvery  mirror, and oxygen which, being a gas, escapes from the tube. The  presence of the oxygen is shown by lighting the end of a splint,  extinguishing the flame and bringing the glowing coal into the mouth of  the tube. The oxygen causes the glowing coal to burst into a flame.         In a similar way oxygen may be obtained from its compounds with       some of the other elements. Thus manganese dioxide, a black       compound of manganese and oxygen, when heated to about 700 deg.,       loses one third of its oxygen, while barium dioxide, when       heated, loses one half of its oxygen.    3. _Preparation from potassium chlorate (usual laboratory method)._  Potassium chlorate is a white solid which consists of 31.9% potassium,  28.9% chlorine, and 39.2% oxygen. When heated it undergoes a series of  changes in which all the oxygen is finally set free, leaving a compound  of potassium and chlorine called potassium chloride. The change may be  represented as follows:       /potassium\\    |           | (potassium     / potassium \\ (potassium   {  chlorine   }            = {             }             + oxygen    |           |  chlorate)     \\ chlorine  /  chloride)     \\oxygen   /    [Illustration: JOSEPH PRIESTLEY (English) (1733-1804)    School-teacher, theologian, philosopher, scientist; friend of Benjamin  Franklin; discoverer of oxygen; defender of the phlogiston theory; the  first to use mercury in a pneumatic trough, by which means he first  isolated in gaseous form hydrochloric acid, sulphur dioxide, and  ammonia]    The evolution of the oxygen begins at about 400 deg.. It has been found,  however, that if the potassium chlorate is mixed with about one fourth  its weight of manganese dioxide, the oxygen is given off at a much lower  temperature. Just how the manganese dioxide brings about this result is  not definitely known. The amount of oxygen obtained from a given weight  of potassium chlorate is exactly the same whether the manganese dioxide  is present or not. So far as can be detected the manganese dioxide  undergoes no change.    [Illustration: Fig. 4]    ~Directions for preparing oxygen.~ The manner of preparing oxygen from  potassium chlorate is illustrated in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 4).  A mixture consisting of one part of manganese dioxide and four parts of  potassium chlorate is placed in the flask A and gently heated. The  oxygen is evolved and escapes through the tube B. It is collected by  bringing over the end of the tube the mouth of a bottle completely  filled with water and inverted in a vessel of water, as shown in the  figure. The gas rises in the bottle and displaces the water. In the  preparation of large quantities of oxygen, a copper retort (Fig. 5) is  often substituted for the glass flask.    [Illustration: Fig. 5]    In the preparation of oxygen from potassium chlorate and manganese  dioxide, the materials used must be pure, otherwise a violent explosion  may occur. The purity of the materials is tested by heating a small  amount of the mixture in a test tube.    ~The collection of gases.~ The method used for collecting oxygen  illustrates the general method used for collecting such gases as are  insoluble in water or nearly so. The vessel C (Fig. 4), containing the  water in which the bottles are inverted, is called a _pneumatic trough._    ~Commercial methods of preparation.~ Oxygen can now be purchased stored  under great pressure in strong steel cylinders (Fig. 6). It is prepared  either by heating a mixture of potassium chlorate and manganese dioxide,  or by separating it from the nitrogen and other gases with which it is  mixed in the atmosphere. The methods employed for effecting this  separation will be described in subsequent chapters.    [Illustration: Fig. 6]    ~Physical properties.~ Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas,  slightly heavier than air. One liter of it, measured at a temperature of  0 deg. and under a pressure of one atmosphere, weighs 1.4285 g., while under  similar conditions one liter of air weighs 1.2923 g. It is but slightly  soluble in water. Oxygen, like other gases, may be liquefied by applying  very great pressure to the highly cooled gas. When the pressure is  removed the liquid oxygen passes again into the gaseous state, since its  boiling point under ordinary atmospheric pressure is -182.5 deg..    ~Chemical properties.~ At ordinary temperatures oxygen is not very active  chemically. Most substances are either not at all affected by it, or the  action is so slow as to escape notice. At higher temperatures, however,  it is very active, and unites directly with most of the elements. This  activity may be shown by heating various substances until just ignited  and then bringing them into vessels of the gas, when they will burn with  great brilliancy. Thus a glowing splint introduced into a jar of oxygen  bursts into flame. Sulphur burns in the air with a very weak flame and  feeble light; in oxygen, however, the flame is increased in size and  brightness. Substances which readily burn in air, such as phosphorus,  burn in oxygen with dazzling brilliancy. Even substances which burn in  air with great difficulty, such as iron, readily burn in oxygen.    The burning of a substance in oxygen is due to the rapid combination of  the substance or of the elements composing it with the oxygen. Thus,  when sulphur burns both the oxygen and sulphur disappear as such and  there is formed a compound of the two, which is an invisible gas, having  the characteristic odor of burning sulphur. Similarly, phosphorus on  burning forms a white solid compound of phosphorus and oxygen, while  iron forms a reddish-black compound of iron and oxygen.    ~Oxidation.~ The term _oxidation_ is applied to the chemical change which  takes place when a substance, or one of its constituent parts, combines  with oxygen. This process may take place rapidly, as in the burning of  phosphorus, or slowly, as in the oxidation (or rusting) of iron when  exposed to the air. It is always accompanied by the liberation of heat.  The amount of heat liberated by the oxidation of a definite weight of  any given substance is always the same, being entirely independent of  the rapidity of the process. If the oxidation takes place slowly, the  heat is generated so slowly that it is difficult to detect it. If the  oxidation takes place rapidly, however, the heat is generated in such a  short interval of time that the substance may become white hot or burst  into a flame.    ~Combustion; kindling temperature.~ When oxidation takes place so rapidly  that the heat generated is sufficient to cause the substance to glow or  burst into a flame the process is called _combustion_. In order that any  substance may undergo combustion, it is necessary that it should be  heated to a certain temperature, known as the _kindling temperature._  This temperature varies widely for different bodies, but is always  definite for the same body. Thus the kindling temperature of phosphorus  is far lower than that of iron, but is definite for each. When any  portion of a substance is heated until it begins to burn the combustion  will continue without the further"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#4)"],[1,"was concerned in a burglary and was  transported.

Their names were Mary  Beaton (or _Bethune_), Mary Livingston (or _Leuison_), Mary Fleming (or  _Flemyng_), and Mary Seaton (_Seton_ or _Seyton_).    [Asterism] Mary Carmichael has no place in authentic history, although  an old ballad says:        Yestrien the queen had four Marys;        This night she'll hae but three:      There was Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton,        And Mary Carmichael, and me.

Mary Anne was the red-name for the republic years ago, and there       always was a sort of myth that these secret societies had been       founded by a woman.         The Mary-Anne associations, which are essentially republic, are       scattered about all the provinces of France.--_Lothair._      =Mary Graham=, an orphan adopted by old Martin Chuzzlewit. She eventually  married Martin Chuzzlewit, the grandson, and hero of the tale.      =Mary Scudder.= Blue-eyed daughter of a \"capable\" New England housewife.

The doctor, upon discovering the truth, resigns his  betrothed to the younger lover.--Harriet Beecher Stowe, _The Minister's  Wooing_ (1862).      =Mary Stuart=, an historical tragedy by J. Haynes (1840). The subject is  the death of David Rizzio.    [Asterism] Schiller has taken Mary Stuart for the subject of a tragedy.  P. Lebrun turned the German drama into a French play. Sir W. Scott, in  _The Abbot_, has taken for his subject the flight of Mary to England.      =Mary Tudor.= Victor Hugo has a tragedy so called (1833), and Tennyson, in  1878, issued a play entitled _Queen Mary_, an epitome of the reign of  the Tudor Mary.      =Mary and Byron.= The \"Mary\" of Lord Byron was Miss Chaworth. Both were  under the guardianship of Mr. White. Miss Chaworth married John Musters,  and Lord Byron married Miss Milbanke; both equally unfortunate. Lord  Byron, in _The Dream_, refers to his love-affair with Mary Chaworth.      =Mary in Heaven= (_To_) and _Highland Mary_, lyrics addressed by Robert  Burns to Mary Campbell, between whom and the poet there existed a strong  attachment previous to the latter's departure from Ayrshire to  Nithsdale. _Mary Morison_, a youthful effusion, was written to the  object of a prior passion.

[Asterism] She is introduced by Sir W. Scott, in his novel entitled _The  Abbot_.    Schiller has taken Mary Stuart for the subject of his best tragedy, and  P. Lebrun brought out in France a French version thereof (1729-1807).    _Mary queen of Scots._ The most elegant and poetical compliment ever  paid to woman was paid to Mary queen of Scots, by Shakespeare, in  _Midsummer Night's Dream_. Remember, the _mermaid_ is \"Queen Mary;\" the  _dolphin_ means the \"dauphin of France,\" whom Mary married; the _rude  sea_ means the \"Scotch rebels;\" and the _stars that shot from their  spheres_ means \"the princes who sprang from their allegiance to Queen  Elizabeth.\"                      Thou remember'st      Since once I sat upon a promontory,      And heard a _mermaid_, on a _dolphin's_ back,      Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,      That the _rude sea_ grew civil at her song;      And certain _stars shot madly from their spheres_,      To hear the sea-maid's music.        Act ii. sc. 1 (1592).    These \"stars\" were the earl of Northumberland, the earl of Westmoreland,  and the duke of Norfolk.      =Mary, the Maid of the Inn=, the delight and sunshine of the parish, about  to be married to Richard, an idle, worthless fellow. One autumn night,  two guests were drinking at the inn, and one remarked he should not much  like to go to the abbey on such a night. \"I'll wager that Mary will go,\"  said the other, and the bet was accepted. Mary went, and, hearing  footsteps, stepped into a place of concealment, when presently passed  her two young men carrying a young woman they had just murdered. The hat  of one blew off, and fell at Mary's feet. She picked it up, and flew to  the inn, told her story, and then, producing the hat, found it was  Richard's. Her senses gave way, and she became a confirmed maniac for  life.--R. Southey, _Mary, the Maid of the Inn_ (from Dr. Plot's _History  of Staffordshire_, 1686).      =Mary Pyncheon.= (See PYNCHEON.)      =Mary Woodcock.= (See WOODCOCK.)      =Mar'zavan=, foster-brother of the Princess Badou'ra.--_Arabian Nights_  (\"Camaralzaman and Badoura\").      =Masaniello=, a corruption of [Tom]maso Aniello, a Neapolitan fisherman,  who headed an insurrection in 1647 against the duke of Arcos; and he  resolved to kill the duke's son for having seduced Fenella, his sister,  who was deaf and dumb. The insurrection succeeded, and Masaniello was  elected by his rabble \"chief magistrate of Portici;\" but he became  intoxicated with his greatness, so the mob shot him, and flung his dead  body into a ditch. Next day, however, it was taken out and interred with  much ceremony and pomp. When Fenella heard of her brother's death, she  threw herself into the crater of Vesuvius.    [Asterism] Auber has an opera on the subject (1831), the libretto by  Scribe. Caraffa had chosen the same subject for an opera previously.      =Mascarille= (3 _syl._), the valet of La Grange. In order to reform two  silly, romantic girls, La Grange and Du Croisy introduce to them their  valets, as the \"marquis of Mascarille\" and the \"viscount of Jodelet.\"  The girls are taken with their \"aristocratic visitors;\" but when the  game has gone far enough, the masters enter and unmask the trick. By  this means the girls are taught a most useful lesson, and are saved from  any serious ill consequences.--Moli[`e]re, _Les Pr['e]cieuses Ridicules_  (1659).    [Asterism] Moli[`e]re had already introduced the same name in two other of  his comedies, _L'Etourdi_ (1653) and _Le D['e]pit Amoureux_ (1654).      =Masetto=, a rustic engaged to Zerl[=i]na; but Don Giovanni intervenes  before the wedding, and deludes the foolish girl into believing that he  means to make her a great lady and his wife.--Mozart, _Don Giovanni_  (libretto by L. da Ponte, 1787).      =Mask'well=, the \"double dealer.\" He pretends to love Lady Touchwood, but  it is only to make her a tool for breaking the attachment between  Mellefont (2 _syl._) and Cynthia. Maskwell pretends friendship for  Mellefont merely to throw dust in his eyes respecting his designs to  carry off Cynthia, to whom Mellefont is betrothed. Cunning and hypocrisy  are Maskwell's substitutes for wisdom and honesty.--W. Congreve, _The  Double Dealer_ (1700).      =Massasowat.= The account given by Edward Winslow of the illness of  Massasowat--the friendly Indian chief whose alliance with the pilgrim  father ceased only with his life--is a curious contribution to colonial  literature. The remedies and diet used by Winslow are so extraordinary  as to give unintentional point to his remark--\"We, with admiration,  blessed GOD for giving his blessing to such rare and ignorant  means.\"--Edward Winslow, _Good News from New England_ (1624).      =Mason= (_William_). The medallion to this poet in Westminster Abbey was  by Bacon.    _Mason_ (_Lady_). She forges a will purporting to be by her husband,  securing his estate to herself and her son.
