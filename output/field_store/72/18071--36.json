[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19092"],[0,"The Adventures of Paddy Beaver (#4)"],[1,"'s boy stared and  stared, his mouth gaping wide open. He looked so funny that Peter  Rabbit, who was hiding under an old pile of brush close by, nearly  laughed right out.    But Peter didn't laugh. No, Sir, Peter didn't laugh, for just that very  minute something happened. Sniff! Sniff! That was right behind him at  the very edge of the old brush-pile, and every hair on Peter stood on  end with fright.    \"Bow, wow, wow!\" It seemed to Peter that the great voice was right in  his very ears. It frightened him so that he just _had_ to jump. He  didn't have time to think. And so he jumped right out from under the  pile of brush and of course right into plain sight. And the very instant  he jumped there came another great roar behind him. Of course it was  from Bowser the Hound. You see, Bowser had been following the trail of  his master, but as he always stops to sniff at everything he passes, he  had been some distance behind. When he came to the pile of brush under  which Peter was hiding he had sniffed at that, and of course he had  smelled Peter right away.    Now when Peter jumped out so suddenly, he had landed right at one end  of the dam. The second roar of Bowser's great voice frightened him still  more, and he jumped right up on the dam. There was nothing for him to do  now but go across, and it wasn't the best of going. No, indeed, it  wasn't the best of going. You see, it was mostly a tangle of sticks.  Happy Jack Squirrel or Chatterer the Red Squirrel or Striped Chipmunk  would have skipped across it without the least trouble. But Peter Rabbit  has no sharp little claws with which to cling to logs and sticks, and  right away he was in a peck of trouble. He slipped down between the  sticks, scrambled out, slipped again, and then, trying to make a long  jump, he lost his balance and--tumbled heels over head into the water!    Poor Peter Rabbit! He gave himself up for lost this time. He could swim,  but at best he is a poor swimmer and doesn't like the water. He couldn't  dive and keep out of sight like Jerry Muskrat or Billy Mink. All he  could do was to paddle as fast as his legs would go. The water had gone  up his nose and down his throat so that he choked, and all the time he  felt sure that Bowser the Hound would plunge in after him and catch him.  And if he shouldn't, why Farmer Brown's Boy would simply wait for him to  come ashore and then catch him.    But Farmer Brown's boy didn't do anything of the kind. No, Sir, he  didn't. Instead he shouted to Bowser and called him away. Bowser didn't  want to come, but he long ago learned to obey, and very slowly he walked  over to where his master was sitting.    \"You know it wouldn't be fair, old fellow, to try to catch Peter now. It  wouldn't be fair at all, and we never want to do anything unfair, do  we?\" said he. Perhaps Bowser didn't agree, but he wagged his tail as if  he did, and sat down beside his master to watch Peter swim.    It seemed to Peter as if he never, never would reach the shore,  though really it was only a very little distance that he had to  swim. When he did scramble out, he was a sorry looking Rabbit.  He didn't waste any time, but started for home as fast as he could  go, lipperty--lipperty--lip. And Farmer Brown's boy and Bowser the  Hound just laughed and didn't try to catch him at all.    \"Well, I never!\" exclaimed Sammy Jay, who had seen it all from the  top of a pine-tree. \"Well, I never! I guess Farmer Brown's boy isn't  so bad, after all.\"    [Illustration]          IX    PADDY PLANS A HOUSE      Paddy the Beaver sat on his dam, and his eyes shone with happiness as he  looked out over the shining water of the pond he had made. All around  the edge of it grew the tall trees of the Green Forest. It was very  beautiful and very still and very lonesome. That is, it would have  seemed lonesome to almost any one but Paddy the Beaver. But Paddy never  is lonesome. You see, he finds company in the trees and flowers and all  the little plants.    It was still, very, very still. Over on one side was a beautiful rosy  glow in the water. It was the reflection from jolly, round, red Mr. Sun.  Paddy couldn't see him because of the tall trees, but he knew exactly  what Mr. Sun was doing. He was going to bed behind the Purple Hills.  Pretty soon the little stars would come out and twinkle down at him. He  loves the little stars and always watches for the first one.    Yes, Paddy the Beaver was very happy. He would have been perfectly  happy but for one thing: Farmer Brown's boy had found his dam and pond  that very afternoon, and Paddy wasn't quite sure what Farmer Brown's boy  might do. He had kept himself snugly hidden while Farmer Brown's boy was  there, and he felt quite sure that Farmer Brown's boy didn't know who  had built the dam. But for this very reason he might, he just _might_,  try to find out all about it, and that would mean that Paddy would have  to be always on the watch.    \"But what's the use of worrying over troubles that haven't come yet, and  may never come? Time enough to worry when they do come,\" said Paddy to  himself, which shows that Paddy has a great deal of wisdom in his little  brown head. \"The thing for me to do now is to get ready for winter, and  that means a great deal of work,\" he continued. \"Let me see, I've got to  build a house, a big, stout, warm house, where I will be warm and safe  when my pond is frozen over. And I've got to lay in a supply of food,  enough to last me until gentle Sister South Wind comes to prepare the  way for lovely Mistress Spring. My, my, I can't afford to be sitting  here dreaming, when there is such a lot to be done!\"    With that Paddy slipped into the water and swam all around his new pond  to make sure of just the best place to build his house. Now placing  one's house in just the right place is a very important matter. Some  people are dreadfully careless about this. Jimmy Skunk, for instance,  often makes the mistake of digging his house (you know Jimmy makes his  house underground) right where every one who happens along that way will  see it. Perhaps that is because Jimmy is so independent that he doesn't  care who knows where he lives.    But Paddy the Beaver never is careless. He always chooses just the very  best place. He makes sure that it is best before he begins. So now,  although he was quite positive just where his house should be, he swam  around the pond to make doubly sure. Then, when he was quite satisfied,  he swam over to the place he had chosen. It was where the water was  quite deep.    \"There mustn't be the least chance that the ice will ever get thick  enough to close up my doorway,\" said he, \"and I'm sure it never will  here. I must make the foundations strong and the walls thick. I must  have plenty of mud to plaster with, and inside, up above the water, I  must have the snuggest, warmest room where I can sleep in comfort. This  is the place to build it, and it is high time I was at work.\"    With that Paddy swam over to the place where he had cut the trees for  his dam, and his heart was light, for he had long ago learned that the  surest way to be happy is to be busy.          X    PADDY STARTS HIS HOUSE      Jerry Muskrat was very much interested when he found that Paddy the  Beaver, who, you know, is his cousin, was building a house. Jerry is a  house-builder himself, and down deep in his heart he very much doubted  if Paddy could build as good a house as he could. His house was down in  the Smiling Pool, and Jerry thought it a very wonderful house indeed,  and was very proud of it. It was built of mud and sod and little alder  and willow twigs and bulrushes. Jerry had spent one winter in it, and he  had decided to spend another there after he had fixed it up a little.  So, as long as he didn't have to build a brand new house, he could  afford the time to watch his cousin Paddy. Perhaps he hoped that Paddy  would ask his advice.    But Paddy did nothing of the kind. He had seen Jerry Muskrat's house,  and he had smiled. But he had taken great pains not to let Jerry see  that smile. He wouldn't have hurt Jerry's feelings for the world. He is  too polite and good-natured to do anything like that. So Jerry sat on  the end of an old log and watched Paddy work. The first thing to build  was the foundation. This was of mud and grass with sticks worked into it  to hold it together. Paddy dug the mud from the bottom of his new pond.  And because the pond was new, there was a great deal of grassy sod  there, which was just what Paddy needed. It was very convenient.    Jerry watched a little while and then, because Jerry is a worker  himself, he just had to get busy and help. Rather timidly he told his  big cousin that he would like to have a share in building the new house.    \"All right,\" replied Paddy, \"that will be fine. You can bring mud while  I am getting the sticks and grass.\"    So Jerry dived down to the bottom of the pond and dug up mud and piled  it on the foundation and was happy. The little stars looked down and  twinkled merrily as they watched the two workers. So the foundation grew  and grew down under the water. Jerry was very much surprised at the size  of it. It was ever and ever so much bigger than the foundation for his  own house. You see, he had forgotten how much bigger Paddy is.    Each night Jerry and Paddy worked, resting during the daytime.  Occasionally Bobby Coon or Reddy Fox or Unc' Billy Possum or Jimmy Skunk  would come to the edge of the pond to see what was going on. Peter  Rabbit came every night. But they couldn't see much because, you know,  Paddy and Jerry were working under water.    But at last Peter was rewarded. There, just above the water, was a  splendid platform of mud and grass and sticks. A great many sticks were  carefully laid as soon as the platform was above the water, for Paddy  was very particular about this. You see, it was to be the floor for the  splendid room he was planning to build. When"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19098"],[0,"Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan (#4)"],[1,"is clearly the name  of a Germanic season--probably a two-month tide covering the second half  of November, the whole of December, and the first half of January.{26}  It may well suggest to us the element added to Christmas by the barbarian  peoples who began to learn Christianity about the time when the festival  was founded. Modern research has tended to disprove the idea that the old  Germans held a Yule feast at the winter solstice, and it is probable, as  we shall see, that the specifically Teutonic Christmas customs come from  a New Year and beginning-of-winter festival kept about the middle of  November. These customs transferred to Christmas are to a great extent  religious or magical rites intended to secure prosperity during the  coming year, and there is also the familiar Christmas feasting,  apparently derived in part from the sacrificial banquets that marked the  beginning of winter.           *       *       *       *       *    We have now taken a general glance at the elements which have combined in  Christmas. The heathen folk-festivals absorbed by the Nativity feast were  essentially life-affirming, they expressed the mind of men who said \"yes\"  to this life, who valued earthly good things. On the other hand  Christianity, at all events in its intensest form, the religion of the  monks, was at bottom pessimistic as regards this earth, and valued it  only as a place of discipline for the life to come; it was essentially a  religion of renunciation that said \"no\" to the world. The |26| Christian  had here no continuing city, but sought one to come. How could the  Church make a feast of the secular New Year; what mattered to her the  world of time? her eye was fixed upon the eternal realities--the great  drama of Redemption. Not upon the course of the temporal sun through the  zodiac, but upon the mystical progress of the eternal Sun of  Righteousness must she base her calendar. Christmas and New Year's  Day--the two festivals stood originally for the most opposed of  principles.    Naturally the Church fought bitterly against the observance of the  Kalends; she condemned repeatedly the unseemly doings of Christians in  joining in heathenish customs at that season; she tried to make the first  of January a solemn fast; and from the ascetic point of view she was  profoundly right, for the old festivals were bound up with a lusty  attitude towards the world, a seeking for earthly joy and well-being.    The struggle between the ascetic principle of self-mortification,  world-renunciation, absorption in a transcendent ideal, and the natural  human striving towards earthly joy and well-being, is, perhaps, the most  interesting aspect of the history of Christianity; it is certainly shown  in an absorbingly interesting way in the development of the Christian  feast of the Nativity. The conflict is keen at first; the Church  authorities fight tooth and nail against these relics of heathenism,  these devilish rites; but mankind's instinctive paganism is  insuppressible, the practices continue as ritual, though losing much of  their meaning, and the Church, weary of denouncing, comes to wink at  them, while the pagan joy in earthly life begins to colour her own  festival.    The Church's Christmas, as the Middle Ages pass on, becomes increasingly  \"merry\"--warm and homely, suited to the instincts of ordinary humanity,  filled with a joy that is of this earth, and not only a mystical rapture  at a transcendental Redemption. The Incarnate God becomes a real child to  be fondled and rocked, a child who is the loveliest of infants, whose  birthday is the supreme type of all human birthdays, and may be kept with  feasting and dance and song. Such is the Christmas of popular tradition,  the Nativity as it is reflected in the carols, the cradle-rocking, the  mystery plays of the later Middle Ages. This |27| Christmas, which  still lingers, though maimed, in some Catholic regions, is strongly  life-affirming; the value and delight of earthly, material things is  keenly felt; sometimes, even, it passes into coarseness and riot. Yet a  certain mysticism usually penetrates it, with hints that this dear life,  this fair world, are not all, for the soul has immortal longings in her.  Nearly always there is the spirit of reverence, of bowing down before the  Infant God, a visitor from the supernatural world, though bone of man's  bone, flesh of his flesh. Heaven and earth have met together; the rough  stable is become the palace of the Great King.    This we might well call the \"Catholic\" Christmas, the Christmas of the  age when the Church most nearly answered to the needs of the whole man,  spiritual and sensuous. The Reformation in England and Germany did not  totally destroy it; in England the carol-singers kept up for a while the  old spirit; in Lutheran Germany a highly coloured and surprisingly  sensuous celebration of the Nativity lingered on into the eighteenth  century. In the countries that remained Roman Catholic much of the old  Christmas continued, though the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, faced  by the challenge of Protestantism, made for greater \"respectability,\" and  often robbed the Catholic Christmas of its humour, its homeliness, its  truly popular stamp, substituting pretentiousness for simplicity, sugary  sentiment for naive and genuine poetry.    Apart from the transformation of the Church's Christmas from something  austere and metaphysical into something joyous and human, warm and  kindly, we shall note in our Second Part the survival of much that is  purely pagan, continuing alongside of the celebration of the Nativity,  and often little touched by its influence. But first we must consider the  side of the festival suggested by the English and French names:  _Christmas_ will stand for the liturgical rites commemorating the wonder  of the Incarnation--God in man made manifest--_Noel_ or \"the Birthday,\"  for the ways in which men have striven to realize the human aspect of the  great Coming.    How can we reach the inner meaning of the Nativity feast, its  significance for the faithful? Better, perhaps, by the way of |28|  poetry than by the way of ritual, for it is poetry that reveals the  emotions at the back of the outward observances, and we shall understand  these better when the singers of Christmas have laid bare to us their  hearts. We may therefore first give attention to the Christmas poetry of  sundry ages and peoples, and then go on to consider the liturgical and  popular ritual in which the Church has striven to express her joy at the  Redeemer's birth. Ceremonial, of course, has always mimetic tendencies,  and in a further chapter we shall see how these issued in genuine drama;  how, in the miracle plays, the Christmas story was represented by the  forms and voices of living men.    |29| |30| |31|              Part I--The Christian Feast          CHAPTER II    CHRISTMAS POETRY (I)[8]{1}          Ancient Latin Hymns, their Dogmatic, Theological      Character--Humanizing Influence of Franciscanism--Jacopone da Todi's      Vernacular Verse--German Catholic Poetry--Mediaeval English Carols.    [Illustration:    MADONNA ENTHRONED WITH SAINTS AND ANGELS.    PESELLINO    (_Empoli Gallery_)]    Christmas, as we have seen, had its beginning at the middle of the fourth  century in Rome. The new feast was not long in finding a hymn-writer to  embody in immortal Latin the emotions called forth by the memory of the  Nativity. \"Veni, redemptor gentium\" is one of the earliest of Latin  hymns--one of the few that have come down to us from the father of Church  song, Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan (d. 397). Great as theologian and  statesman, Ambrose was great also as a poet and systematizer of Church  music. \"Veni, redemptor gentium\" is above all things stately and severe,  in harmony with the austere character of the zealous foe of the Arian  heretics, the champion of monasticism. It is the theological aspect alone  of Christmas, the redemption of sinful man by the mystery of the  Incarnation and the miracle of the Virgin Birth, that we find in St.  Ambrose's terse and pregnant Latin; there is no feeling for the human  pathos and poetry of the scene at Bethlehem--       \"Veni, redemptor gentium,      Ostende partum virginis;      Miretur omne saeculum:      Talis decet partus Deum. |32|      Non ex virili semine,      Sed mystico spiramine,      Verbum Dei factum caro,      Fructusque ventris floruit.\"[9]{2}           *       *       *       *       *    Another fine hymn often heard in English churches is of a slightly later  date. \"Corde natus ex Parentis\" (\"Of the Father's love begotten\") is a  cento from a larger hymn by the Spanish poet Prudentius (_c._ 348-413).  Prudentius did not write for liturgical purposes, and it was several  centuries before \"Corde natus\" was adopted into the cycle of Latin hymns.  Its elaborate rhetoric is very unlike the severity of \"Veni, redemptor  gentium,\" but again the note is purely theological; the Incarnation as a  world-event is its theme. It sings the Birth of Him who is       \"Corde natus ex Parentis      Ante mundi exordium,      Alpha et O cognominatus,      Ipse fons et clausula      Omnium quae sunt, fuerunt,      Quaeque post futura sunt          Saeculorum saeculis.\"[10]{3}    Other early hymns are \"A solis ortus cardine\" (\"From east to west, from  shore to shore\"), by a certain Coelius Sedulius (d. _c._ 450), still sung  by the Roman Church at Lauds on Christmas Day, and \"Jesu, redemptor  omnium\" (sixth century), the office hymn at Christmas Vespers. Like the  poems of Ambrose and Prudentius, they are in classical metres, unrhymed,  and based upon quantity, not accent, and they have the same general  character, doctrinal rather than humanly tender.    In the ninth and tenth centuries arose a new form of hymnody, the Prose  or Sequence sung after the Gradual (the anthem between the Epistle and  Gospel at Mass). The earliest writer of"]]]
