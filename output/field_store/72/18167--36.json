In this  respect also, though to a lesser extent, may be mentioned the Canon  or Ecclesiastical law--consisting of papal decretals on various points  which were founded partially on the Roman or Civil law--a juridical  system which also fully and indeed almost exclusively recognized the  individual holding of property as the basis of civil society (albeit  not without a recognition of social duties on the part of the owner).    Learning was now beginning to differentiate itself from the  ecclesiastical profession, and to become a definite vocation in its  various branches. Crowds of students flocked to the seats of learning,  and, as travelling scholars, earned a precarious living by begging or  \"professing\" medicine, assisting the illiterate for a small fee, or  working wonders, such as casting horoscopes, or performing  thaumaturgic tricks. The professors of law were now the most  influential members of the Imperial Council and of the various  Imperial Courts. In Central Europe, as elsewhere, notably in France,  the civil lawyers were always on the side of the centralizing power,  alike against the local jurisdictions and against the peasantry.    The effects of the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, and the  consequent dispersion of the accumulated Greek learning of the  Byzantine Empire, had, by the end of the fifteenth century, begun to  show themselves in a notable modification of European culture. The  circle of the seven sciences, the Quadrivium, and the Trivium, in  other words, the mediaeval system of learning, began to be antiquated.  Scholastic philosophy, that is to say, the controversy of the Scotists  and the Thomists, was now growing out of date. Plato was extolled at  the expense of Aristotle. Greek, and even Hebrew, was eagerly sought  after. Latin itself was assuming another aspect; the Renaissance Latin  is classical Latin, whilst Mediaeval Latin is dog-Latin. The physical  universe now began to be inquired into with a perfectly fresh  interest, but the inquiries were still conducted under the aegis of the  old habits of thought. The universe was still a system of mysterious  affinities and magical powers to the investigator of the Renaissance  period, as it had been before. There was this difference, however; it  was now attempted to _systematize_ the magical theory of the universe.  While the common man held a store of traditional magical beliefs  respecting the natural world, the learned man deduced these beliefs  from the Neo-Platonists, from the Kabbala, from Hermes Trismegistos,  and from a variety of other sources, and attempted to arrange this  somewhat heterogeneous mass of erudite lore into a system of organized  thought.    The Humanistic movement, so called, the movement, that is, of revived  classical scholarship, had already begun in Germany before what may be  termed the _sturm und drang_ of the Renaissance proper. Foremost among  the exponents of this older Humanism, which dates from the middle of  the fifteenth century, were Nicholas of Cusa and his disciples,  Rudolph Agricola, Alexander Hegius, and Jacob Wimpheling. But the new  Humanism and the new Renaissance movement generally throughout  Northern Europe centred chiefly in two personalities, Johannes  Reuchlin and Desiderius Erasmus. Reuchlin was the founder of the new  Hebrew learning, which up till then had been exclusively confined to  the synagogue. It was he who unlocked the mysteries of the Kabbala to  the Gentile world. But though it is for his introduction of Hebrew  study that Reuchlin is best known to posterity, yet his services in  the diffusion and popularization of classical culture were enormous.  The dispute of Reuchlin with the ecclesiastical authorities at Cologne  excited literary Germany from end to end. It was the first general  skirmish of the new and the old spirit in Central and Northern Europe.    But the man who was destined to become the personification of the  Humanist movement, us the new learning was called, was Erasmus. The  illegitimate son of the daughter of a Rotterdam burgher, he early  became famous on account of his erudition, in spite of the adverse  circumstances of his youth. Like all the scholars of his time, he  passed rapidly from one country to another, settling finally in Basel,  then at the height of its reputation as a literary and typographical  centre. The whole intellectual movement of the time centres round  Erasmus, as is particularly noticeable in the career of Ulrich von  Hutten, dealt with in the course of this history. As instances of the  classicism of the period, we may note the uniform change of the  patronymic into the classical equivalent, or some classicism supposed  to be the equivalent. Thus the name Erasmus itself was a classicism of  his father's name Gerhard, the German name Muth became Mutianus,  Trittheim became Trithemius, Schwarzerd became Melanchthon, and so on.    We have spoken of the other side of the intellectual movement of the  period. This other side showed itself in mystical attempts at reducing  nature to law in the light of the traditional problems which had been  set, to wit, those of alchemy and astrology: the discovery of the  philosopher's stone, of the transmutation of metals, of the elixir of  life, and of the correspondences between the planets and terrestrial  bodies. Among the most prominent exponents of these investigations may  be mentioned Philippus von Hohenheim or Paracelsus, and Cornelius  Agrippa of Nettesheim, in Germany, Nostrodamus in France, and Cardanus  in Italy. These men represent a tendency which was pursued by  thousands in the learned world. It was a tendency which had the honour  of being the last in history to embody itself in a distinct mythical  cycle. \"Doctor Faustus\" may probably have had an historical germ; but  in any case \"Doctor Faustus,\" as known to legend and to literature, is  merely a personification of the practical side of the new learning.    The minds of men were waking up to interest in nature. There was one  man, Copernicus, who, at least partially, struck through the  traditionary atmosphere in which nature was enveloped, and to his  insight we owe the foundation of astronomical science; but otherwise  the whole intellectual atmosphere was charged with occult views. In  fact, the learned world of the sixteenth century would have found  itself quite at home in the pretensions and fancies of our modern  theosophist and psychical researchers, with their notions of making  erstwhile miracles non-miraculous, of reducing the marvellous to  being merely the result of penetration on the part of certain seers  and investigators of the secret powers of nature. Every wonder-worker  was received with open arms by learned and unlearned alike. The  possibility of producing that which was out of the ordinary range of  natural occurrences was not seriously doubted by any. Spells and  enchantments, conjurations, calculations of nativities, were matters  earnestly investigated at Universities and Courts.    There were, of course, persons who were eager to detect impostors: and  amongst them some of the most zealous votaries of the occult arts--for  example, Trittheim and the learned Humanist, Conrad Muth or Mutianus,  both of whom professed to have regarded Faust as a fraudulent person.  But this did not imply any disbelief in the possibility of the alleged  pretensions. In the Faust-myth is embodied, moreover, the opposition  between the new learning on its physical side and the old religious  faith. The theory that the investigation of the mysteries of nature  had in it something sinister and diabolical which had been latent  throughout the Middle Ages, was brought into especial prominence by  the new religious movements. The popular feeling that the line between  natural magic and the black art was somewhat doubtful, that the one  had a tendency to shade off into the other, now received fresh  stimulus. The notion of compacts with the devil was a familiar one,  and that they should be resorted to for the purpose of acquiring an  acquaintance with hidden lore and magical powers seemed quite natural.    It will have already been seen from what we have said that the  religious revolt was largely economical in its causes. The intense  hatred, common alike to the smaller nobility, the burghers, and the  peasants, of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, was obviously due to its  ever-increasing exactions. The chief of these were the _pallium_ or  price paid to the Pope for an ecclesiastical investiture; the  _annates_ or first year's revenues of a church fief; and the _tithes_  which were of two kinds, the great tithe paid in agricultural produce,  and the small tithe consisting in a head of cattle. The latter seems  to have been especially obnoxious to the peasant. The sudden increase  in the sale of indulgences, like the proverbial last straw, broke down  the whole system; but any other incident might have served the purpose  equally well. The prince-prelates were in some instances, at the  outset, not averse to the movement; they would not have been  indisposed to have converted their territories into secular fiefs of  the empire. It was only after this hope had been abandoned that they  definitely took sides with the Papal authority.    The opening of the sixteenth century thus presents to us mediaeval  society, social, political, and religious, in Germany as elsewhere,  \"run to seed.\" The feudal organization was outwardly intact; the  peasant, free and bond, formed the foundation; above him came the  knighthood or inferior nobility; parallel with them was the  _Ehrbarkeit_ of the less important towns, holding from mediate  lordship; above these towns came the free cities, which held  immediately from the empire, organized into three bodies,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#4)"],[1,". B. Ford, a well known architect of the firm of Geo. B. Post &  Company, New York, was a rather quiet undemonstrative member, but a  worker and investigator in his particular line. His observations and  recommendations should have great weight in the work reconstructing and  rebuilding the destroyed portions of France.    Mr. F. J. LeMaistre, a chemical engineer, quite scientific; not  particularly unselfish in his dealings with his fellow commissioners,  was nevertheless a useful member of the commission, contributing much to  its success. He is connected with the duPont Powder Company in an  important capacity. His chemical knowledge came into good play in the  journeyings of the Commission.    Mr. C. G. Pfeiffer was, physically, the giant of the Commission. An  exporter and importer, a splendid French scholar, utilized on all  occasions when a knowledge of French was needed; a hard, conscientious  worker, quite close to the chairman and of decided use to the head of  the Commission from start to finish--he frequently steered the ship from  shallow shoals and dangerous rapids.    Mr. E. V. Douglass, the efficient secretary of the Commission, is  entitled to much commendation. His work was heavy and unending. To look  after a body of men, many of whom he had never previously met; to deal  with their idiosyncrasies and at times somewhat unreasonable demands,  and come through with success, was no mean task. Mr. Douglass lived in  France and had a wide acquaintance. His knowledge of the French language  was of very great service. I think all members of the Commission will  unite in saying; \"Well done good and faithful servant.\"    Mr. Emile Garden, the French secretary of the Commission, was very  helpful to Mr. Douglass as well as to the chairman.    Mr. Harrison Reeves, a well known writer and newspaper correspondent,  had special charge of the publicity work of the Commission and was  present and took part in all the meetings of the Commissioners, a  trusted attache of the enterprise.    Monsieur Henri Pierre Roche, a French soldier, on leave of absence, one  of the editors of the Paris Temps, was also a valuable attache. He  accompanied the commission on its travels and returned with the  commissioners to America for the express purpose of translating into  French, for final distribution in France, the report of the Commission.    Our first news from home came by wireless on Tuesday, August 29th. It  disclosed that Germany was reaching out for Rumania. We also got more or  less news about the railroad troubles.    At one of our meetings Mr. Nichols presented a letter which Governor  Herrick had written to him and which proved to be quite useful. We  found, wherever we travelled abroad, that the name of Governor Herrick  was a household word. This letter is reproduced as follows:--    * * *    August 24th, 1916.    Mr. W. W. Nichols,  The American Manufacturers' Export Association,  50 Church St., New York, N. Y.    My dear Mr. Nichols:--    It gives me great pleasure to take advantage of your kind  invitation to send by the American Industrial Commission of the  American Manufacturers' Export Association, a message to Industrial  France.    France has met in a way that evokes the admiration of the whole  world, even of her enemies, the recurring emergencies of this  greatest of wars. The patriotic self-sacrifice, the valor, the  uncomplaining endurance, the ingenuity which the French people have  shown during these two years of war reveal what is in truth the  \"birth of a new nation\". To an extent which scarcely seemed  possible, France has discovered within herself the resources of  men and materials with which to meet the demands of the struggle.    Europe has learned many important lessons, not only in military  science but also in industrial efficiency, since 1914. She has much  to impart to the United States in these matters. Yet such has been  the wide-spread destruction of men and property that France, and  indeed all Europe, must needs call upon other countries after the  war for assistance in rehabilitating her industrial and commercial  life. France will need to draw upon our stores of food until all  her fields are again producing; she will need our materials for  reconstruction where war has brought waste and desolation; she will  need our machines and implements to carry on the manifold pursuits  of agriculture, manufacturing and commerce. To France, as to all  the countries where war is causing destruction, America opens her  vast stores of goods.    The American Industrial Commission will be doing service not only  to Europe and to America but to all humanity, if it can discover  the ways by which the wealth that nature has so lavishly showered  upon the New World, may be most effectively poured out for the  restoration of the Old World.    Very sincerely yours,  (Signed) MYRON T. HERRICK.    * * *    The time on the boat was largely occupied in meetings of the  commissioners and the formulation of plans for the work in hand;  committees were appointed and a great deal of work done.    Among the various discussions, the subject of people living to a great  age in Bulgaria was brought up. Specific instances were noted; one, a  pair of Bulgarian twins both of whom lived to be one hundred and twenty  years of age and both died on the same date. It was suggested that the  two oldest members of the Commission, Mr. Farquhar and myself, should  emigrate to Bulgaria and take a fresh start.    The Lafayette had, mounted on its stern, one of the favorite French guns  known as a 75-millimeter. The captain told us he had orders to fire on  the Deutschland if the submarine happened to turn up. The first officer,  under instruction from the captain, showed the operation of the gun to  the commissioners. This was very interesting; everything was done except  to fire off the gun; all the maneuvers were gone through and we  discovered on the lower deck enough shells to fight a good sized battle.    On Saturday, previous to landing, a bazaar was held on the boat for the  benefit of the French hospitals. This was a very successful affair;  contributions were made or supposed to be made by all the passengers.  Among other things, I donated a quart bottle of champagne. This was sold  at auction, the first bid was one dollar, made with the understanding  that the last bid was to be no higher, but was to get the champagne.  These bids continued until the bottle finally brought seventy-five  dollars. It turned out to be a very good article with all that.    We were also informed before entering port that we were protected by two  submarine destroyers.    [Illustration: Autograph Signatures of the Commission.]    We discovered on arising, Sunday morning, September 3rd, that we were in  the Bay of Biscay and two cruisers were circling around and gradually  escorting us into the port of Bordeaux. We were told subsequently that  the wireless apparatus has been disconnected and we had been chased by a  submarine.    The first land seen was the shore of Spain, the course of the vessel  having been diverted on account of pursuit by the submarine. At four P.  M. on Sunday a commission from Bordeaux came out in a tug boat to meet  us. This delegation consisted of the prefect of Bordeaux district, the  mayor of the city and other notables. They boarded the boat and we  entertained them with a dinner party. We reached the Bordeaux dock about  ten o'clock on Sunday evening, but did not land until the following  morning.          III.    BORDEAUX AND PARIS      Upon going ashore, we discovered on the docks a number of stalwart  laborers. We wondered why they were not in the army, but were told they  were Spaniards. The docks were covered with motor trucks from Cleveland,  piles of copper bars, and also very large quantities of munitions and  barbed wire made by The Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company and the American  Steel & Wire Company. We also saw on the docks steel bars furnished by  our own Brier Hill Steel Company.    We were first impressed by the very large number of women employed. We  visited several telegraph offices and all were \"manned\" exclusively by  women. We also saw women driving large army trucks and milk carts, and  women selling newspapers, some of them anywhere from seventy to eighty  years of age. Newsboys are apparently unknown in France.    We were given a reception by the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce, and quite  an address was delivered by the president.    We then visited the docks, which are extensive. The improvements  contemplated will make Bordeaux one of the great world ports. In going  about the streets we were struck by the number of women in mourning; in  fact I can hardly recall any women, except the servants in the hotel,  who were not in mourning. The shop windows were filled with mourning  goods and people passing on the streets were either women in mourning or  soldiers home on leave of absence, many of them crippled.    We were next taken to the prison camp where the prisoners of war were  held. We happened to reach it when the prisoners were having a siesta.  There were about four thousand in the camp, some hired out to  contractors. We talked to some of these contractors, who in turn had  talked with the prisoners, and were told that a great many of them were  such voluntarily; that is to say, they were very glad to surrender when  the opportunity presented. The prisoners were mostly Germans, but there  were some Austrians and a few Bavarians. The French people never speak  of them as Germans; they always call them \"Boches\", which, rendered in  English, means vandal. They were fat and healthy and apparently  contented.
