There were shelves  on the wall containing what appeared to be books, and indeed were so;  mostly very small, like our diamond duodecimos, shaped in the fashion  of our volumes, and bound in sheets of fine metal. There were several  curious-looking pieces of mechanism scattered about, apparently models,  such as might be seen in the study of any professional mechanician. Four  automata (mechanical contrivances which, with these people, answer the  ordinary purposes of domestic service) stood phantom-like at each angle  in the wall. In a recess was a low couch, or bed with pillows. A window,  with curtains of some fibrous material drawn aside, opened upon a large  balcony. My host stepped out into the balcony; I followed him. We were  on the uppermost story of one of the angular pyramids; the view beyond  was of a wild and solemn beauty impossible to describe:--the vast  ranges of precipitous rock which formed the distant background, the  intermediate valleys of mystic many-coloured herbiage, the flash of  waters, many of them like streams of roseate flame, the serene lustre  diffused over all by myriads of lamps, combined to form a whole of which  no words of mine can convey adequate description; so splendid was it,  yet so sombre; so lovely, yet so awful.    But my attention was soon diverted from these nether landscapes.  Suddenly there arose, as from the streets below, a burst of joyous  music; then a winged form soared into the space; another as if in chase  of the first, another and another; others after others, till the crowd  grew thick and the number countless. But how describe the fantastic  grace of these forms in their undulating movements! They appeared  engaged in some sport or amusement; now forming into opposite squadrons;  now scattering; now each group threading the other, soaring, descending,  interweaving, severing; all in measured time to the music below, as if  in the dance of the fabled Peri.    I turned my gaze on my host in a feverish wonder. I ventured to place my  hand on the large wings that lay folded on his breast, and in doing so a  slight shock as of electricity passed through me. I recoiled in fear;  my host smiled, and as if courteously to gratify my curiosity, slowly  expanded his pinions. I observed that his garment beneath them became  dilated as a bladder that fills with air. The arms seemed to slide  into the wings, and in another moment he had launched himself into the  luminous atmosphere, and hovered there, still, and with outspread wings,  as an eagle that basks in the sun. Then, rapidly as an eagle swoops, he  rushed downwards into the midst of one of the groups, skimming through  the midst, and as suddenly again soaring aloft. Thereon, three forms,  in one of which I thought to recognise my host's daughter, detached  themselves from the rest, and followed him as a bird sportively follows  a bird. My eyes, dazzled with the lights and bewildered by the throngs,  ceased to distinguish the gyrations and evolutions of these winged  playmates, till presently my host re-emerged from the crowd and alighted  at my side.    The strangeness of all I had seen began now to operate fast on my  senses; my mind itself began to wander. Though not inclined to be  superstitious, nor hitherto believing that man could be brought into  bodily communication with demons, I felt the terror and the wild  excitement with which, in the Gothic ages, a traveller might have  persuaded himself that he witnessed a 'sabbat' of fiends and witches.  I have a vague recollection of having attempted with vehement  gesticulation, and forms of exorcism, and loud incoherent words, to  repel my courteous and indulgent host; of his mild endeavors to calm and  soothe me; of his intelligent conjecture that my fright and bewilderment  were occasioned by the difference of form and movement between us which  the wings that had excited my marvelling curiosity had, in exercise,  made still more strongly perceptible; of the gentle smile with which he  had sought to dispel my alarm by dropping the wings to the ground and  endeavouring to show me that they were but a mechanical contrivance.  That sudden transformation did but increase my horror, and as extreme  fright often shows itself by extreme daring, I sprang at his throat like  a wild beast. On an instant I was felled to the ground as by an electric  shock, and the last confused images floating before my sight ere I  became wholly insensible, were the form of my host kneeling beside  me with one hand on my forehead, and the beautiful calm face of his  daughter, with large, deep, inscrutable eyes intently fixed upon my own.        Chapter VI.      I remained in this unconscious state, as I afterwards learned, for many  days, even for some weeks according to our computation of time. When  I recovered I was in a strange room, my host and all his family were  gathered round me, and to my utter amaze my host's daughter accosted me  in my own language with a slightly foreign accent.    \"How do you feel?\" she asked.    It was some moments before I could overcome my surprise enough to falter  out, \"You know my language? How? Who and what are you?\"    My host smiled and motioned to one of his sons, who then took from a  table a number of thin metallic sheets on which were traced drawings of  various figures--a house, a tree, a bird, a man, &c.    In these designs I recognised my own style of drawing. Under each figure  was written the name of it in my language, and in my writing; and in  another handwriting a word strange to me beneath it.    Said the host, \"Thus we began; and my daughter Zee, who belongs to the  College of Sages, has been your instructress and ours too.\"    Zee then placed before me other metallic sheets, on which, in my  writing, words first, and then sentences, were inscribed. Under each  word and each sentence strange characters in another hand. Rallying my  senses, I comprehended that thus a rude dictionary had been effected.  Had it been done while I was dreaming? \"That is enough now,\" said Zee,  in a tone of command. \"Repose and take food.\"        Chapter VII.      A room to myself was assigned to me in this vast edifice. It was  prettily and fantastically arranged, but without any of the splendour  of metal-work or gems which was displayed in the more public apartments.  The walls were hung with a variegated matting made from the stalks and  fibers of plants, and the floor carpeted with the same.    The bed was without curtains, its supports of iron resting on balls of  crystal; the coverings, of a thin white substance resembling cotton.  There were sundry shelves containing books. A curtained recess  communicated with an aviary filled with singing-birds, of which I  did not recognise one resembling those I have seen on earth, except a  beautiful species of dove, though this was distinguished from our doves  by a tall crest of bluish plumes. All these birds had been trained  to sing in artful tunes, and greatly exceeded the skill of our piping  bullfinches, which can rarely achieve more than two tunes, and cannot, I  believe, sing those in concert. One might have supposed one's self at  an opera in listening to the voices in my aviary. There were duets  and trios, and quartetts and choruses, all arranged as in one piece of  music. Did I want silence from the birds? I had but to draw a curtain  over the aviary, and their song hushed as they found themselves left in  the dark. Another opening formed a window, not glazed, but on touching a  spring, a shutter ascended from the floor, formed of some substance  less transparent than glass, but still sufficiently pellucid to allow  a softened view of the scene without. To this window was attached a  balcony, or rather hanging garden, wherein grew many graceful plants  and brilliant flowers. The apartment and its appurtenances had thus a  character, if strange in detail, still familiar, as a whole, to modern  notions of luxury, and would have excited admiration if found attached  to the apartments of an English duchess or a fashionable French author.  Before I arrived this was Zee's chamber; she had hospitably assigned it  to me.    Some hours after the waking up which is described in my last chapter, I  was lying alone on my couch trying to fix my thoughts on conjecture as  to the nature and genus of the people amongst whom I was thrown, when my  host and his daughter Zee entered the room. My host, still speaking  my native language, inquired with much politeness, whether it would be  agreeable to me to converse, or if I preferred solitude. I replied, that  I should feel much honoured and obliged by the opportunity offered me to  express my gratitude for the hospitality and civilities I had received  in a country to which I was a stranger, and to learn enough of its  customs and manners not to offend through ignorance.    As I spoke, I had of course risen from my couch: but Zee, much to my  confusion, curtly ordered me to lie down again, and there was something  in her voice and eye, gentle as both were, that compelled my obedience.  She then seated herself unconcernedly at the foot of my bed, while her  father took his place on a divan a few feet distant.    \"But what part of the world do you come from?\" asked my host, \"that we  should appear so strange to you and you to us? I have seen individual  specimens of nearly all the races differing from our own, except the  primeval savages who dwell in the most desolate and remote recesses of  uncultivated nature, unacquainted with other light than that they obtain  from volcanic fires, and contented to grope their way in the dark, as do  many creeping, crawling and flying things. But certainly you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: Wimborne Minster and Christchurch Priory (#4)"],[1,"4,  and probably at the same time the walls of the nave were raised; and  the roofs of the nave aisles, which had been much lower than now, so  as not to block up the Norman clerestory windows, were raised on the  sides joining the nave walls above the heads of these windows, and a new  clerestory was formed in the raised wall. This contains five windows on  each side, each window being placed over one of the piers of the nave  arcading.    During the Early English period, probably by John de Berwick, who was  dean from 1286-1312, a spire was added to the central tower. This was  for long in an unsafe condition, and at length, in 1600, it fell. The  following is the description given by Coker, a contemporary writer:  \"Having discoursed this longe of this church, I will not overpasse a  strange accident which in our dayes happened unto it, viz. Anno Domini  1600 (the choire beeing then full of people at tenne of clock service,  allsoe the streets by reason of the markett), a sudden mist ariseing,  all the spire steeple, being of a very great height, was strangely cast  downe, the stones battered all the lead and brake much timber of the  roofe of the church, yet without anie hurt to the people; which ruin is  sithence commendablie repaired with the church revenues, for sacriledge  hath not yet swept awaye all, being assisted by Sir John Hannam, a  neighbour gentleman, who if I mistake not enjoyeth revenues of the  church, and hath done commendablie to convert part of it to its former  use.\" Other accounts mention a tempest at the time of the fall. It is  not unlikely that the tower was weakened by the alterations in the  fourteenth century, when wider arches were cut in the west walls of the  transepts, in consequence of the widening of the nave aisles. The fall  of the spire, which fell towards the east, demolished the clerestory  windows of the choir on the south side, and their place was supplied by  a long, low Tudor window oblong in shape and quite plain. The windows,  however, on both sides have been entirely altered, and those now  existing in the clerestory are small lancets of modern date.    The spire was not rebuilt, but the heavy looking battlement and solid  pinnacles which still remain, and detract considerably from the beauty  of the tower, were added as a finish to it in the year 1608. It is  curious that the churchwardens' books, in which many entries occur  detailing repairs and other work connected with the spire, make no  mention of its fall.    The western tower was also a source of trouble. It was built, as has  been already mentioned, during the latter half of the fifteenth century,  the glazing of the windows being completed in 1464; but as early as 1548  it was thought necessary to brick up the west doorway, and notices of  unsoundness of the tower occur frequently in the church books. In 1664  we find the following entry made:--\"Paid in beere to the Ringers for a  peale to trye if the Tower shooke L0 1s 0d.\" As we read this entry, we  cannot help wondering if the large amount of beer which a shilling would  purchase in those days was given to the ringers so as to give them a  fictitious courage and blind their eyes to the possible danger of  bringing the tower down upon their heads. In 1739 the Perpendicular  window in the western face of the tower was taken out and a smaller oval  one put in its place, with a view to the strengthening of the wall by  additional stonework. The modern restorer, however, has again put a  window of Perpendicular character in place of the oval window inserted  in the last century, using to aid him in his design, sundry fragments of  the original tracery found embedded in the walls.    [Illustration: WIMBORNE MINSTER IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. From an old  Print.]    Before the nineteenth-century restorations, the pulpit, probably late  sixteenth-century work, stood in the nave against the middle pillar on  the north side, and the nave and choir were separated by a screen of  three arches on which stood the organ. The central arch had doors.  On either side of the choir were a set of canopied stalls: these  canopies were removed in 1855 to make the chancel aisles available for  a congregation. As the canopies interfered with both sight and sound,  the floor of the choir was lowered to only three steps above the nave,  and the stalls reduced to four on each side, with a view to make room  for restoring the Norman steps indicated by traces on the wall under  the floor, which led up to the high altar of the Norman church. The  arrangement of steps was then three from the nave to the choir, four  from the choir to the next level to the east, and seven from this to the  presbytery, and one more to the altar platform. In 1866 further changes  were made: the stalls were increased to the present number to provide  sufficient accommodation for the choir, the additions being made out of  old woodwork. The level of the floors was also rearranged; five steps  now lead up from the nave to the choir, seven to the presbytery and one  more to the altar platform, the altar itself being raised yet another  step.    During the restoration carried on from 1855 to 1857, great changes  besides those already mentioned were made in the interior: the whitewash  and plaster were removed from the walls, a west gallery was taken down,  the nave re-seated, the organ transferred from its position upon the  screen to the south transept, and much mischief was done from an  archaeological standpoint, a thing which seems almost inseparable from  any nineteenth-century restoration.    An examination of the masonry shows clearly that all the exterior walls  east of the transepts save the east wall of the presbytery, which is  somewhat out of the vertical, the top hanging forward, have been if not  entirely rebuilt at anyrate completely refaced, and this work was no  doubt done at the restoration at the middle of the nineteenth century.  The doorway in the middle of the north choir aisle is entirely modern;  the doorway which formally occupied this place was provided with a small  porch.    How far this rebuilding and refacing were rendered necessary by the  condition of the walls at that time it is now impossible to say. The  fact that the walls of the nave aisles were not similarly treated may  have been due to want of funds, or it may be that the architects  employed found them in a better condition than the walls of the choir  aisles, and so preserved them, though they considered the latter beyond  the possibility of preservation without the extensive renewing that  evidently took place.    The room containing the chained library was at the same time refitted.  New shelves and rods were provided, but the old chains were used again.    The restoration of 1855-1857 did not extend to the transept; but  these were taken in hand in 1891, with the usual result--namely, the  destruction of some existing features, such as the seventeenth-century  tracery of the north window,[3] to make room for a nineteenth-century  window in Decorated style, which, however, differs altogether from any  window in the minster; the walls were raised about two feet and a roof  of higher pitch put upon them, which necessitated alterations in the  gables. A sundial which stood at the summit of the south gable was taken  down, and this in 1894 was erected on a pillar built in the churchyard,  a short distance from the south wall of the western tower. The transept  previous to the restoration with the sun-dial on its gable is shown in  the illustration on p. 19.        [3] This tracery is shown in the illustration on p. 21. The original          foliation seems to have been cut away, and the intermediate          mullions extended to the points of the two lights. This may          have been done with a view to economy in reglazing the window.          The modern window is shown on page 37.    A small chamber to contain the hydraulic apparatus for the organ has  recently been added to the east side of the south transept.          CHAPTER II    THE EXTERIOR      Wimborne Minster does not occupy a commanding position--it stands on  level ground, its two towers are not lofty, the western only reaching  the height of 95 feet and the central 84 feet--but it has the advantage  of having an extensive churchyard both on the south side and also on the  north, so that from either side a good general view of the building may  be obtained. A street running from the east end of the church towards  the north gives the spectator the advantage of a still more distant  standpoint, from which the towers, transepts, choir, and porch group  themselves into one harmonious whole, the long line of iron railings  bounding the churchyard being the only drawback. The first impression is  that there is something wrong with the central tower; the plain heavy  battlement, with its four enormous corner pinnacles, seems to overweight  the tower, and as each side of the parapet is longer than the side of  the tower below, the feeling of top-heaviness is increased. The central  tower has no buttresses, but the western has an octagonal buttress at  each corner, and these decrease in cross section at each of four string  courses; so that this tower seems to taper, and by contrast makes the  central tower seem to bulge out at the top more than it really does.    But Wimborne Minster does not stand alone in giving at first sight a  feeling that something is wanting to perfect beauty. In nearly every  old building which has gradually grown up, been altered and enlarged  by various generations, as need arose, each generation working in  its own style, and often with little regard to what already existed,  incongruities are sure to be discernible. But what is lost in unity  of design increases the interest in the building, historically and  architecturally regarded. And it is worthy of notice that at Wimborne,  more than at many places, the enlargers of the"]]]
