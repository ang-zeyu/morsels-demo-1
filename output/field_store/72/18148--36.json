'Twon't hurt me _a_ tall!\"    \"But I can't let you, Flaxie Frizzle; truly I can't; so don't ask me  again.\"    Flaxie's lip curled as well as her nose.    \"Poh! I haven't got so good a sister as I fought I had. Laugh to me,  Ninny, and get me my pretty new hat, or I'll shut you up in the closet!\"    Ninny did laugh, it was so funny to hear that speck of a child talk of  punishing a big girl like her!    \"Will you lem me go?\" repeated Flaxie.    \"No, indeed! What an idea!\"    \"I've got fi-ive cents, Ninny. I'll buy you anyfing what you want? Now  lem me! 'Twon't hurt me _a_ tall!\"    Ninny shook her head, and kept shaking it; and Flaxie began to push her  toward the closet door.    \"_Will_ you get my hat, Ninny? 'Cause when I die 'n' go to hebben, then  you won't have no little sister.\"    \"No, I will not get your hat, miss, so there!\"    All this while Flaxie was pushing, and Ninny was shaking her head. The  closet-door stood open, and, before Ninny thought much about it, she was  inside.    \"There you is!\" laughed the baby.    Then rising on her \"tippy-toes,\" Flaxie began to fumble with the key.  Ninny smiled to hear her breathe so hard, but never thought the wee, wee  fingers could do any harm.    At last the key, after clicking for a good while, turned round in the  lock; yes, fairly turned. The door was fastened.    \"Let me out! out! out!\" cried Ninny, pounding with both hands.    Flaxie was perfectly delighted. She had not known till then that the  door was locked, and if Ninny had been quiet she would probably have  kept fumbling away till she opened it. But now she wouldn't so much as  touch the key, you may be sure. O, Flaxie Frizzle was a big rogue, as  big as she _could_ be, and be so little! There she stood, hopping up and  down, and laughing, with the blind kitty hugged close to her bosom.    \"Laugh to me, Ninny!\"    \"What do I want to laugh for? Let me out, you naughty girl!\"    \"Well, _you_ needn't laugh, but _I_ shall. Now I's goin' to grandma's,  and carry my white kitty.\"    \"No, no, you mustn't, you mustn't!\"    \"_You_ can't help it! I _is_ a goin'!\"    \"Flaxie! Flax-ee!\"    Oh! where was Eva Snow? Would she never come? There was a sliding-door  in the wall above the middle shelf, and Ninny climbed up and pushed it  back. It opened into the parlor-closet, where the china dishes stood. If  she could only crawl through that sliding door she might get out by way  of the parlor, if she _did_ break the dishes.    But, oh dear! it wasn't half big enough. She could only put her head in,  and part of one shoulder. What should she do?    It was of no use screaming to that witch of a Frizzle; but she did  scream. She threatened to \"whip her,\" and \"tie her,\" and \"box her ears,\"  and \"burn up her dollies.\"    But Flaxie knew she wouldn't; so she calmly pulled off her boots and put  on her rubbers.    Then Ninny coaxed. She promised candy and oranges and even wedding-cake,  for she forgot she hadn't a speck of wedding-cake in the world.    But, while she was still screaming, Flaxie was out of sight and hearing.  She hadn't found her hat; but, with her new rubbers on her feet, and the  blind kitty still hugged to her bosom, she was \"going to grandma's.\" She  ran with all her might; for what if somebody should catch her before she  got there!    \"The faster I hurry the quicker I can't go,\" said she, puffing for  breath.    It was a beautiful day. The wind blew over the grass, and the grass  moved in green waves; Flaxie thought it was running away like herself.    It was half a mile to the bridge. By the time she reached Mr. Pratt's  store, which was half way, she thought she would stop to rest.    \"'Cause he'll give me some candy,\" said she, and walked right into the  store, though it was half full of men,--oh fie! Flaxie Frizzle!    Mr. Jones, a lame man, was sitting next the door, and she walked boldly  up to him.    \"Mr. _Lame_ Jones, does you want to see my kitty?\"    He laughed, and took it in his hands; and another man pinched its tail.  Flaxie screamed out:    \"You mustn't hold it by the handle, Mr. Man!\"    Then they all laughed more than ever, and clapped their hands; and Mr.  Jones said:    \"You're a cunning baby!\"    \"Well,\" replied Flaxie, quickly, \"what makes you have turn-about feet?\"    This wasn't a proper thing to say, and it made Mr. Jones look sober, for  he was sorry to have such feet. Mr. Pratt was afraid Flaxie would talk  more about them; so he frowned at her and said:    \"Good little girls don't run away bare-headed, Miss Frizzle! Is your  mamma at home?\"    \"Guess I'll go now,\" said Flaxie; \"some more folks will want to see my  kitty.\"    Mr. Pratt's boy ran after her with a stick of candy, but could not catch  her. She called now at all the houses along the road, ringing the bells  so furiously that people rushed to the doors, afraid something dreadful  had happened.    \"I fought you'd want to see my kitty,\" said the runaway, holding up the  little blind bundle; and they always laughed then; how could they help  it?    But somehow nobody thought of sending her home.    When she reached the bridge she was hungry, and told the \"bridge-man\"  she was \"fond of cookies.\" His wife gave her a caraway-cake shaped like  a leaf.    \"I'm fond o' that one,\" said she, with her mouth full. \"Please give me  _two_ ones.\"    Just fancy it! Begging food at people's houses! Yet her mamma _had_  tried to teach her good manners, little as you may think it.    \"I don't believe she has had any supper. It must be she is running  away,\" said the bridge-man's wife, as Flaxie left her door. \"I ought to  have stopped her; but somebody will, of course.\"    But nobody did. People only laughed at her kitty, and then passed on.    Soon the sun set, and the new moon shone white against the blue sky.  Flaxie had often seen the moon, but it looked larger and rounder than  this. What ailed it now?    \"Oh, I know,\" said she, \"God has doubled it up.\"    She had changed her mind, and did not want to go to her grandmother's.    \"Mr. Pratt fought I was bare-headed, and grandma'll fink I'm  bare-headed. Guess I won't go to g'andma's, kitty, I'll go to  preach-man's house; preach-man will want to see you.\"    On she went till she came to the church. Then she sat down on the big  steps, dreadfully tired.    \"Oh, my yubbers ache so! Now go s'eep, Kitty; and when you want to wake  up, call me, and I'll wake you.\"    This was the last Flaxie remembered. When the postmaster found her, she  was sitting up, fast asleep, with her little tow head against the door,  and the kitty in her arms. The kitty was still alive.    Eva Snow had come and let Ninny out of the closet long ago; and lots of  people had been hunting ever since for Flaxie Frizzle. When the  postmaster and the minister brought her home between them, Mrs. Gray was  so very glad that she laughed and cried. Still she thought Flaxie ought  to be punished.    \"O mamma,\" said Miss Frizzle next morning, very much surprised to find  herself tied by the clothes-line to a knob in the bay-window. \"The men  laughed to me, they did! Mr. Lame Jones, he said I was very cunning!\"    But for all that, her mamma did not untie her till afternoon; and then  Flaxie promised \"honestly,\" not to run away again.    Would you trust her?          FIVE POUNDS OF CINNAMON.      They don't name girls \"Roxy,\" and \"Polly,\" and \"Patty,\" and \"Sally,\"  nowadays; but when the little miss who is my heroine was a lady, those  short, funny old names were not at all old-fashioned. \"Roxy,\"  especially, was considered a very sweet name indeed. All these new  names, \"Eva,\" and \"Ada,\" and \"Sadie,\" and \"Lillie,\" and the rest of the  fanciful \"ies\" were not in vogue. Then, if a romantic, highflown young  mamma wished to give her tiny girl-baby an unusually fine name, she  selected such as \"Sophronia,\" \"Matilda,\" \"Lucretia,\" or \"Ophelia.\" In  extreme cases, the baby could be called \"Victoria Adelaide.\"    In this instance baby's mother was a plain, quiet woman; and she  thought baby's grandmother's name was quite fine enough for baby; and so  baby was called \"Roxy,\" and, when she was ten years old, you would have  thought little Roxy fully as old-fashioned as her name.    _I think it is her clothes_ that makes her image look so funny as she  rises up before me. She herself had brown hair and eyes, and a good  country complexion of milk and roses--such a nice complexion, girls! You  see she had plenty of bread and milk to eat; and a big chamber, big as  the sitting-room down stairs, to sleep in--all windows--and her bed  stood, neat and cool, in the middle of the floor; and she had to walk  ever so far to get anywhere--it was a respectable little run even out to  the barn for the hens' eggs; and it was half a mile to her cousin  Hannah's, and it was three quarters to school, and just a mile to the  very nearest stick of candy or cluster of raisins. Nuts were a little  nearer; for Roxy's father had a noble butternut orchard, and it was as  much a part of the regular farm-work in the fall to gather the  \"but'nuts\" as it was to gather the apples.    Don't you see, now, why she had such a nice complexion? But if you think  it don't quite account for such plump, rosy cheeks, why, then, she had  to chase ever so many ways for the strawberries. Not a strawberry was  raised in common folks' gardens in those days. They grew mostly in  farmers' meadows; and very angry those farmers used to be at such girls  as Roxy in \"strawberry time\"--\"strawberry time\" comes before \"mowing,\"  you know--for how they did wallow and trample the grass! Besides, the  raspberries and blackberries, instead of being Doolittle Blackcaps, and  Kittatinnies, and tied up to nice stakes in civilized little  plantations, grew away off upon steep hill-sides, and in the edges of  woods, by old logs, and around stumps; and it took at least three girls,  and half a day, and a lunch-basket, and torn dresses, and such  clambering, and such fun,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20116"],[0,"The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead, Volume 1 (of 3) (#4)"],[1," 355 _sq._; sham burial of eminent men, 356; ghosts driven away  from the village, 356-358; deceiving the ghosts of women who have died  in child-bed, 358; funeral feasts, 358 _sq._; funeral customs in the  New Hebrides, 359 _sqq._; the aged buried alive, 359 _sq._; seclusion of  mourners and restrictions on their diet, 360; sacrifice of pigs, 360  _sq._; the journey of the ghost to the spirit land, 361 _sq._;  provisions made by the living for the welfare of the dead, 362.

Note.--Myth of the Continuance of Death    Index          LECTURE I    INTRODUCTION      [Sidenote: Natural theology, and the three modes of handling it, the  dogmatic, the philosophical, and the historical.]    The subject of these lectures is a branch of natural theology. By  natural theology I understand that reasoned knowledge of a God or gods  which man may be supposed, whether rightly or wrongly, capable of  attaining to by the exercise of his natural faculties alone. Thus  defined, the subject may be treated in at least three different ways,  namely, dogmatically, philosophically, and historically. We may simply  state the dogmas of natural theology which appear to us to be true: that  is the dogmatic method. Or, secondly, we may examine the validity of the  grounds on which these dogmas have been or may be maintained: that is  the philosophic method. Or, thirdly, we may content ourselves with  describing the various views which have been held on the subject and  tracing their origin and evolution in history: that is the historical  method. The first of these three methods assumes the truth of natural  theology, the second discusses it, and the third neither assumes nor  discusses but simply ignores it: the historian as such is not concerned  with the truth or falsehood of the beliefs he describes, his business is  merely to record them and to track them as far as possible to their  sources. Now that the subject of natural theology is ripe for a purely  dogmatic treatment will hardly, I think, be maintained by any one, to  whatever school of thought he may belong; accordingly that method of  treatment need not occupy us further. Far otherwise is it with the  philosophic method which undertakes to enquire into the truth or  falsehood of the belief in a God: no method could be more appropriate at  a time like the present, when the opinions of educated and thoughtful  men on that profound topic are so unsettled, diverse, and conflicting. A  philosophical treatment of the subject might comprise a discussion of  such questions as whether a natural knowledge of God is possible to man,  and, if possible, by what means and through what faculties it is  attainable; what are the grounds for believing in the existence of a  God; and, if this belief is justified, what may be supposed to be his  essential nature and attributes, and what his relations to the world in  general and to man in particular. Now I desire to confess at once that  an adequate discussion of these and kindred questions "]]]
