If two texts of the Law be opposed to each other, an argument  founded on usage is of force; but the Dharma Sastra is of greater  force than the Artha Sastra.[63] This is a settled rule.    22. Legal proofs are described as, writing, possession, and witnesses.    In the absence of either of those, it is ordained, that some one of  the ordeals is [to be resorted to.]    23. In all disputes where property is concerned, the last act is of  greater force;[64] except in [cases of] pledge, gift,[65] and sale,  when the first act is of greater force.[66]    24. If one see[67] his land in the possession of another[68] and say  nothing, it is lost after twenty years; moveables after ten years:[69]    25. excepting pledges, boundary-limits, deposits with  specification,[70] property of idiots and children, deposits without  specification,[71] property of the monarch, of women, and of those  learned in the Vedas.    26. One who appropriates[72] a pledge, &c., shall be compelled to  restore to the owner his property, and to pay a fine of equal value,  or according to his means,[73] to the monarch.    27. Acquisition by title[74] is stronger[75] than possession, unless  this has come down from ancestors;[76] but acquisition by title is of  no avail without possession for a short time.[77]    28. If one holding by title have it questioned [in a Court of  justice], he must establish it by proof: but not so his son, nor his  son's son; in their case, possession is of greater weight.    29. If one whose title is questioned die [pending the suit[78]], his  heir must establish it by proof; in such case possession without title  will not avail.[79]    30. Those appointed by the monarch,[80] communities,[81] guilds,[82]  and families, have authority, one after the other,[83] to investigate  law-suits among men.    31. The monarch shall annul decisions of suits which have been brought  about by force or fraud; also those made by women, those made at  night, those made in private chambers, those made in a place beyond  the limits,[84] and those made by enemies.    32. A suit instituted by one intoxicated, or insane, or stricken with  disease,[85] or given up to vice,[86] or a minor, or one under the  influence of fear, &c.,[87] or one having no interest, is invalid.    33. When lost property is found,[88] it shall be restored by the  monarch to the owner: if the claimant fail to identify by some sign,  he shall pay an equivalent fine.    34. If the monarch find a treasure,[89] he shall give half of it to  the twice-born.[90] If, on the other hand, a twice-born [find a  treasure], he shall, if learned, take the whole, for he is lord of  all.[91]    35. Of treasure found by any one else,[92] the monarch shall take a  sixth.[93] If the finder do not make report, but [his discovery] comes  to light, he shall surrender [what he has found], and shall, besides,  be punished.    36. Stolen property, however, is to be given up by the monarch to the  subject; seeing that, if he do not give it, he shall bear all the sin  of that person from whom [it is stolen].[94]    37. Where there is a pledge, the interest, month by month, shall be an  eightieth part; otherwise, two, three, four or five parts, in a  hundred, according to the order of cast.[95]    38. They however who travel in forests[96] give ten parts; they who  go to sea, twenty parts, in a hundred. Or, all[97] must render to all,  of whatever cast, the rate of interest settled amongst themselves.[98]    39. But for cattle and women lent [the return] is, their offspring:  the highest encrease demandable for use of liquids[99] is eight-fold;  for wearing apparel, for corn, and for gold, four-fold, three-fold and  two-fold respectively.    40. The monarch should not blame one who enforces a recognised  debt.[100] If he, against whom the debt is enforced, complain to the  monarch, he may be punished, besides being compelled to pay the debt.    41. The debtor [as a general rule] shall be made to pay his creditors  in the order in which he has received from them; but a brahman he  is to pay [first], and, after him, the monarch.    42. The debtor shall be made to pay to the monarch ten parts in a  hundred of the sum proved against him;[101] and the creditor, when he  has recovered his property, five parts.[102]    43. One of inferior cast,[103] who is without means, may be compelled  to labour[104] in discharge of his debt; but a brahman,[105]  wanting means [to discharge his debt at once], shall pay gradually in  proportion to what may come to him.    44. If one do not accept restitution of his property on loan when  offered, it is to be delivered to some third party; from which time it  ceases to carry interest.    45. A debt incurred by undivided kinsmen on account of the family  shall be discharged by the heirs of the head of the family, should the  latter die or leave the country.[106]    46. A woman has not to pay a debt incurred by her husband or by her  son, nor a father the debt of his son; except such debts be incurred  on account of the family: and it is the same with a husband [in  respect of a debt] incurred by his wife.    47. A son has not to pay, in this world, his father's debt incurred  for spirituous liquor,[107] or, for gratification of lust, or in  gambling, nor a fine, nor what remains unpaid of a toll; nor [shall  he make good] idle gifts.[108]    48. As to debts of wives of herdsmen, distillers, players, washermen  and hunters, the husbands have to pay; because their maintenance  depends upon their wives.    49. A debt acknowledged,[109] one incurred by her jointly with her  husband, one incurred by herself [solely][110]--these must be paid by  the wife; none other need be paid by her.    50. If a father have gone abroad, or died, or been subdued by  calamity,[111] his debt shall be paid by his sons and grandsons;[112]  on their denial,[113] the debt must be proved by witnesses.    51. He who takes the property of one who leaves no [capable][114] son,  shall pay the debts; so, he who takes[115] the widow; also that son  whose paternal estate no other has appropriated, [and who in such  case shall always be deemed] fit to inherit property;[116] and if one  die without any son, then, whosoever succeeds to the property.    52. To become surety, to be indebted, and to give evidence, is  unlawful between brothers, between husband and wife, or between father  and son; except, where they are separated in property.    53. Giving surety is enjoined for appearance, for confidence,[117] and  for payment.[118] If there be a failure of either of the first two,  the surety [himself] in each case shall pay; of the third, his sons  [also] must pay.    54. If surety for appearance or for confidence die, the sons have not  to pay; of a surety for payment, the sons have to pay.[119]    55. If there are several sureties, they shall pay the debt according  to their respective liabilities: if all have undertaken for the entire  debt,[120] they shall [severally be made to] pay at the option of the  creditor.    56. If a surety be compelled by process of law[121] to discharge the  debt, the [principal] debtors shall reimburse him double the amount  paid.    57. For [use of] women and cattle, the offspring shall be given: for  corn, [a return of] three fold; for apparel, four fold; for liquids,  eight fold.    58. [The owner's property in] a pledge is forfeited if it be not  redeemed when the debt is doubled; of one made for a definite period,  it is forfeited at the specified date. [The property in] a pledge with  usufruct[122] does not become forfeit.    59. If a [simple] pledge be put to use, no interest is [demandable]:  so it is if a pledge with usufruct be damaged. If the pledge be wholly  spoiled or be destroyed, it must be replaced; except where caused by  accident,[123] or by the monarch.[124]    60. A pledge is complete upon acceptance.[125] If the thing pledged  have become worthless, although [duly] cared for, either another shall  be given [in its place], or the creditor shall receive back his money.    61. If a pledge be [given or taken, in reliance] upon character,[126]  the debtor shall be made to pay with interest: the debtor shall be  made to repay two-fold, if he received on his plighted word.[127]    62. If one come [and pay his debt], the pledge shall be released;  otherwise he [who has the pledge] is a thief:[128] should the creditor  be absent, the debtor is to receive back his pledge upon paying the  debt to the family;[129]    63. Or it may remain where it was, without interest [on the debt], the  value at that date [of the thing pledged] being ascertained. If the  debtor fail to come, the creditor may sell [the pledge] before  witnesses.    64. If the debt secured by pledge have become doubled, the pledge  shall be released; provided, the [value of the] usufruct of the thing  pledged be double [the amount of] the loan.[130]    65. _Upanidhi_ is something in a box delivered to the hands of  another, without a declaration. This shall be restored in the same  manner [as it was given].[131]    66. But one shall not be compelled to make good that of which he has  been deprived by the monarch, by accident, or by thieves.[132] When  the loss occurs after demand has been made, and the deposit not  returned, the depositee is to make it good and to pay a fine of equal  value.    67. Whoever of his own accord uses [this description of deposit] shall  be fined, and must restore it, together with the profit made.    The same rule applies to things borrowed[133] [for a special  occasion], also to what is delivered for the purpose of being restored  to the owner,[134] also to what is deposited [in the absence of the  head, with the other members of the family],[135] also to the deposits  called _nikshepa_,[136] and the like.[137]    68.

It makes the noise by striking  the edges of the gauzy wings and hard wing covers together. See, this  way!\" And the old man struck his arm and leg together. \"It has another  fiddle, too, which it uses when it makes the long, rasping, drowsy sound  of summer days. Then it rubs the rough edges of its hind leg against the  edge of its wing-cover.\"    \"Please, is it happy, then?\" asked Betty.    \"Just as happy as a healthy locust, who lives in long, sweet-smelling  grass and is contented with his own singing, can be, and that is very  happy.\"    \"Oh!\" said Betty, \"it doesn't use its mouth, then? Jimmie said it did.\"    \"Jimmie's a stupid boy. See this fellow.\" The old man held the locust  toward Betty. \"With its upper lip, broad, you see; and there is the  lower lip made in two scallops, and there's a short feeler on either  side, and another pair of soft jaws with a feeler. Hidden away under  those parts is a pair of dark-brown, horny jaws which open like two big  swinging gates.\"    \"What makes them so big?\"    \"The better to eat you with, my dear.\" The guide worked his jaws until  Betty, half afraid and half pleased, screamed and ran behind a tree.  \"Oh, how they can eat!\" growled the old man, \"more than any little girl  or boy I ever knew! Years and years ago, when your mamma was a baby,  they mounted up into the air from the Rocky Mountains and flew eastward  in a great cloud. Down they swooped upon the fertile valleys in rustling  hordes, and ate everything in sight--grass, grains, vegetables, and  bushes. They ate and ate and ate until they had eaten up fifty million  dollars' worth of food, and the poor farmer could hear nothing but the  sound of the chewing of those ever-swinging jaws. Now, be off, little  girl, or my pails won't be clean.\"    \"Oh, please, sir, just tell me how they jump and breathe.\"    \"Dear, dear, see this fellow!\" He had wet a little grain of maple sugar,  and a tiny meadow grasshopper which had alighted on his knee was pushing  the sweet stuff into its mouth with both fore legs. \"Child, you must  never,\" said the old man, savagely, \"push your food in that way.\"    \"Please, sir,\" answered Betty, \"I never do, because I eat with my fork  and my knife. Please, sir, are they happy when they jump?\"    \"Looks like a horse, doesn't it?\" asked the old man. \"It's made for  jumping. Think of all the training it takes to make a jumper of your  brother at school. Well, this chap can jump ten times as far. It's born  with a better jump than the longest-legged boy you ever saw. But the  locust might get its head cut off when jumping if it weren't for this  little saddle that covers the soft part of the neck. Mr. Locust can't  always look before he leaps, as a little girl can, and the knife edge of  a blade of grass would cut its head right off if it weren't for this  saddle. See, here are its long leaping-legs, and on the back edge of  these are some spines to keep it from slipping, and the feet are padded  with several soft little cushions that keep it from chin-chopping itself  to pieces when it lands after a long jump. And here, my dear, are little  rest-legs just behind the front legs. With these Mr. Locust hangs on to  a blade of grass when tired--a fine idea, child; every little boy and  girl ought to have some rest-legs like the locust. And the locust has  some extra eyes, too.\"    Ben Gile was going so fast now that Betty was listening to him, mouth  open, as he pointed with a blade of grass to one thing after another.    \"You see, the locust has two big eyes, and there in the middle of the  forehead it has three little eyes, and with five eyes there isn't much  it can't see. And here on the body are two tiny shining oval windows.  These are ear-laps, and that, my dear, is the way it hears. And upon the  sides of the body (the thorax--that is, just the chest) and his abdomen  are tiny holes. The air enters through these, and that is the way Mr.  Locust breathes.\"    \"Oh,\" said Betty, \"then it hasn't got any nose? I thought everything in  the world had a nose.\"    \"And this little body,\" the old man went on, \"is as strong as a grub  hoe. With it the locust makes holes in fence rails, logs, stumps, and  the earth, and in those holes mother locust lays her eggs. See, those  four spines are for boring holes. With these Mrs. Locust bores a hole in  the ground, and then with these same spines she guides the bundles of  eggs into the hole and covers them up with a gummy stuff. There the eggs  stay until next spring, when, my dear, out comes a little hopper with no  wings, and this little hopper is called a nymph. It grows and splits its  skin, grows and splits its skin, and with its new skin--it has five or  six skins, and leaves all its old clothes hanging around on the  bushes--its wings grow bigger and bigger. At last it flies off just as  its mother and father did a year ago.\"    Ben Gile tossed the locust into the air and called out, \"Shoo!\" clapping  his hands loudly together. Out from the woods came two baby deer, a  wise, gentle old cow; from the cabin came a mother cat and three kittens  and a big black dog; and from the trees scampered down a half a dozen  squirrels.    \"Time for dinner.\"    Betty went up to him and whispered something in his ear. The old man  nodded his head solemnly, and the little girl went trotting along the  path to Rangeley Village.          IV    FIDDLERS      There was the greatest scurrying around in the fields on the edge of the  woods about Ben Gile's cabin. Little girls and boys were flitting hither  and thither with pretty nets and small boxes strapped over their  shoulders. Inside the boxes there seemed to be just as much hopping  about as there was outside.    By-and-by the guide put his head out of his cabin door and called, \"How  many have you?\"    \"Oh, lots and lots!\" the children answered.    \"Bring them in.\" And the children trooped into the cabin, which they  thought quite the most wonderful place in the world. Its walls were  lined with books and cases. The books were not only in English, but also  in French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek, and other languages, and the  cases were filled with scores of specimens, the most beautiful  butterflies, moths, beetles, birds, flowers, and rare stones. The floor  of the cabin was covered by different kinds of skins. Besides, there  were telescopes, field-glasses, magnifying-glasses, specimen cases, old  weapons, and a flute. And by the great wide fireplace, in front of which  the guide was cooking biscuits and cookies in a reflector oven, lay  several kittens, the old black dog, Thor, and a dappled fawn which Thor  was licking.    \"Those crickets sound like pop-guns,\" said the old man, slipping more  cookies into the oven and setting a pan of biscuits on a shelf by the  hearth.    \"Oh, please,\" said little Hope, \"we've got bushels of them!\"    \"Now we'll let those cookies bake while we 'tend to the fiddlers. Are  four pans of cookies enough for five children?\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"Now, Hope, let me have your bushel box. H'm,\" he murmured, peeping in,  \"all dressed for the party. What color?\"    \"Brown, sir.\"    \"Black, too,\" said Betty; \"and on a few,\" she added, \"there's a stripe  or a weeny spot of color.\"    \"Oho!\" exclaimed the old man, \"what have we here?\" He took a pale little  creature from Hope's basket.    \"Why, it's white and green tinted,\" called Jimmie. \"That isn't a  cricket.\"    \"Isn't it? Well, it's a first cousin which lives in the trees and loves  its tree home so much, like the sensible little fellow it is, that it  sings 'Tr-e-e-e, tr-e-e-e,' as fast as it can trill all summer long. But  it is very harmful to the tree, because when egg-laying time comes it  cuts a long slit in the trees in which to lay its eggs. Just a minute!\"  The old man shifted the position of the baker, and out came such a good  odor of cookies that all the children sniffed with delight. \"Here,  Jack,\" he said, to a brown little fellow in ragged clothes and bare  feet, \"you have a singer in your box.\"    \"I didn't catch but one,\" said the lad.    \"Briers aren't good for bare legs, are they? Never mind, your crickets  won't eat one another.\"    \"Eat one another?\" cried the children.    \"Yes, crickets are cannibals, like some other insects, and they  frequently eat a near relation or a friend, as the people in the Fiji  Islands used to do. This is a nice brown little chap, Jack. Do you know  how he makes his music?\"    [Illustration:  _A._ File on wing of cricket.  _B._ Scraper on wing of cricket.  _C._ Mrs. Cricket.]    \"Why, I suppose,\" said the boy, \"he opens his mouth the way Mr. Tucker  does in the church choir, and--\"    There was a shout of laughter from Jimmie, who was sure he knew a great  deal.    \"Well,\" said the guide to Jim, \"then how does it make its music, since  you know?\"    \"Not with its mouth.\"    \"Then how?\"    \"I don't know, sir,\" stammered Jimmie, who found he didn't know as much  as he thought he did.    \"When Mr. Cricket sings,\" went on the hermit, \"it lifts its two wing  covers so that the edges meet like the pointed roof of a house. Then  your little fiddler, Jack, rubs one edge against the other.\"    All this time Peter Beech had been waving his hand about, the way  children do in school, and giving big sniffs.    \"Please, sir, the cookies are burning.\"    \"Bless my soul!\" The guide whisked the cookies away.    \"Please, sir,\" said Jack, \"are we going to have something soon?\" Jack  did not look as if he had his share of food to eat, for he was as thin  as the fawn which had curled up near him. Jack had twelve brothers and  sisters, and a father who wasn't what he ought to be, so there were  times when there was no food for Jack.    \"Yes, my son,\""]]]
