Let him not be  grasping nor have his mind preoccupied with the idea of receiving  perquisites, but let him with dignity keep up his position by cherishing  a good reputation. These are among the precepts of philosophy.  Furthermore philosophy treats of physics (in Greek [Greek: physiologia])  where a more careful knowledge is required because the problems which  come under this head are numerous and of very different kinds; as, for  example, in the case of the conducting of water. For at points of intake  and at curves, and at places where it is raised to a level, currents of  air naturally form in one way or another; and nobody who has not learned  the fundamental principles of physics from philosophy will be able to  provide against the damage which they do. So the reader of Ctesibius or  Archimedes and the other writers of treatises of the same class will not  be able to appreciate them unless he has been trained in these subjects  by the philosophers.    8. Music, also, the architect ought to understand so that he may have  knowledge of the canonical and mathematical theory, and besides be able  to tune ballistae, catapultae, and scorpiones to the proper key. For to  the right and left in the beams are the holes in the frames through  which the strings of twisted sinew are stretched by means of windlasses  and bars, and these strings must not be clamped and made fast until they  give the same correct note to the ear of the skilled workman. For the  arms thrust through those stretched strings must, on being let go,  strike their blow together at the same moment; but if they are not in  unison, they will prevent the course of projectiles from being straight.    [Illustration: PERSIANS    (From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]    9. In theatres, likewise, there are the bronze vessels (in Greek [Greek:  echeia]) which are placed in niches under the seats in accordance with  the musical intervals on mathematical principles. These vessels are  arranged with a view to musical concords or harmony, and apportioned in  the compass of the fourth, the fifth, and the octave, and so on up to  the double octave, in such a way that when the voice of an actor falls  in unison with any of them its power is increased, and it reaches the  ears of the audience with greater clearness and sweetness. Water  organs, too, and the other instruments which resemble them cannot be  made by one who is without the principles of music.    10. The architect should also have a knowledge of the study of medicine  on account of the questions of climates (in Greek [Greek: klimata]),  air, the healthiness and unhealthiness of sites, and the use of  different waters. For without these considerations, the healthiness of a  dwelling cannot be assured. And as for principles of law, he should know  those which are necessary in the case of buildings having party walls,  with regard to water dripping from the eaves, and also the laws about  drains, windows, and water supply. And other things of this sort should  be known to architects, so that, before they begin upon buildings, they  may be careful not to leave disputed points for the householders to  settle after the works are finished, and so that in drawing up contracts  the interests of both employer and contractor may be wisely  safe-guarded. For if a contract is skilfully drawn, each may obtain a  release from the other without disadvantage. From astronomy we find the  east, west, south, and north, as well as the theory of the heavens, the  equinox, solstice, and courses of the stars. If one has no knowledge of  these matters, he will not be able to have any comprehension of the  theory of sundials.    11. Consequently, since this study is so vast in extent, embellished and  enriched as it is with many different kinds of learning, I think that  men have no right to profess themselves architects hastily, without  having climbed from boyhood the steps of these studies and thus, nursed  by the knowledge of many arts and sciences, having reached the heights  of the holy ground of architecture.    12. But perhaps to the inexperienced it will seem a marvel that human  nature can comprehend such a great number of studies and keep them in  the memory. Still, the observation that all studies have a common bond  of union and intercourse with one another, will lead to the belief that  this can easily be realized. For a liberal education forms, as it were,  a single body made up of these members. Those, therefore, who from  tender years receive instruction in the various forms of learning,  recognize the same stamp on all the arts, and an intercourse between all  studies, and so they more readily comprehend them all. This is what led  one of the ancient architects, Pytheos, the celebrated builder of the  temple of Minerva at Priene, to say in his Commentaries that an  architect ought to be able to accomplish much more in all the arts and  sciences than the men who, by their own particular kinds of work and the  practice of it, have brought each a single subject to the highest  perfection. But this is in point of fact not realized.    13. For an architect ought not to be and cannot be such a philologian as  was Aristarchus, although not illiterate; nor a musician like  Aristoxenus, though not absolutely ignorant of music; nor a painter like  Apelles, though not unskilful in drawing; nor a sculptor such as was  Myron or Polyclitus, though not unacquainted with the plastic art; nor  again a physician like Hippocrates, though not ignorant of medicine; nor  in the other sciences need he excel in each, though he should not be  unskilful in them. For, in the midst of all this great variety of  subjects, an individual cannot attain to perfection in each, because it  is scarcely in his power to take in and comprehend the general theories  of them.    14. Still, it is not architects alone that cannot in all matters reach  perfection, but even men who individually practise specialties in the  arts do not all attain to the highest point of merit. Therefore, if  among artists working each in a single field not all, but only a few in  an entire generation acquire fame, and that with difficulty, how can an  architect, who has to be skilful in many arts, accomplish not merely the  feat--in itself a great marvel--of being deficient in none of them, but  also that of surpassing all those artists who have devoted themselves  with unremitting industry to single fields?    15. It appears, then, that Pytheos made a mistake by not observing that  the arts are each composed of two things, the actual work and the theory  of it. One of these, the doing of the work, is proper to men trained in  the individual subject, while the other, the theory, is common to all  scholars: for example, to physicians and musicians the rhythmical beat  of the pulse and its metrical movement. But if there is a wound to be  healed or a sick man to be saved from danger, the musician will not  call, for the business will be appropriate to the physician. So in the  case of a musical instrument, not the physician but the musician will be  the man to tune it so that the ears may find their due pleasure in its  strains.    16. Astronomers likewise have a common ground for discussion with  musicians in the harmony of the stars and musical concords in tetrads  and triads of the fourth and the fifth, and with geometricians in the  subject of vision (in Greek [Greek: logos optikos]); and in all other  sciences many points, perhaps all, are common so far as the discussion  of them is concerned. But the actual undertaking of works which are  brought to perfection by the hand and its manipulation is the function  of those who have been specially trained to deal with a single art. It  appears, therefore, that he has done enough and to spare who in each  subject possesses a fairly good knowledge of those parts, with their  principles, which are indispensable for architecture, so that if he is  required to pass judgement and to express approval in the case of those  things or arts, he may not be found wanting. As for men upon whom nature  has bestowed so much ingenuity, acuteness, and memory that they are able  to have a thorough knowledge of geometry, astronomy, music, and the  other arts, they go beyond the functions of architects and become pure  mathematicians. Hence they can readily take up positions against those  arts because many are the artistic weapons with which they are armed.  Such men, however, are rarely found, but there have been such at times;  for example, Aristarchus of Samos, Philolaus and Archytas of Tarentum,  Apollonius of Perga, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, and among Syracusans  Archimedes and Scopinas, who through mathematics and natural philosophy  discovered, expounded, and left to posterity many things in connexion  with mechanics and with sundials.    17. Since, therefore, the possession of such talents due to natural  capacity is not vouchsafed at random to entire nations, but only to a  few great men; since, moreover, the function of the architect requires a  training in all the departments of learning; and finally, since reason,  on account of the wide extent of the subject, concedes that he may  possess not the highest but not even necessarily a moderate knowledge of  the subjects of study, I request, Caesar, both of you and of those who  may read the said books, that if anything is set forth with too little  regard for grammatical rule, it may be pardoned. For it is not as a very  great philosopher, nor as an eloquent rhetorician, nor as a grammarian  trained in the highest principles of his art, that I have striven to  write this work, but as an architect who has had only a dip into those  studies. Still, as regards the efficacy of the art and the theories of  it, I promise and expect that in these volumes I shall undoubtedly show  myself of very considerable importance not only to builders but also to  all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#4)"],[1,"beings.    The Mohammedan, the Jew, the Christian, will readily agree that the  animism, the fetishism, and idolatry of the savage were man-made foolish  beliefs. They can readily perceive that there was nothing supernatural,  nothing revealed, in such beliefs; but they do not realize that to him,  in his infantile development, the fetish and the idol were just as  supernatural and superior as the modern conception of a Supreme Being.  In each age man creates his god, in his own image, and within the  confines of his own mental development. The mind of man has expanded so  that it has conquered more and more of his environment; it has grown and  wrested from nature those secrets which constitute his civilization.  Along with this has progressed the conception of a deity, but only to a  certain extent. The mind has embellished the outward appearance of its  gods, consolidated them, and built upon them intricate systems of  theology, upon which feed vast hordes of clergy; but the basic  conception, the fundamental principle, that there must be something  supernatural to explain something which we cannot explain at the present  moment, that conception still drugs the mind of man. Primitive man did  not understand the meaning of lightning, thunder, shadows, echoes, etc.,  and he placed these among the supernatural phenomena. The modern mind  explains these phenomena, understands the laws governing their  production. Yet, it is this same modern mind which persists in going  back to our savage ancestors and their mental sloth, by attributing the  myriads of phenomena which still elude its present stage of mental  development, to a particular idol, this time, a Supreme Being.  Brahmanism, Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Taoism,  Zoroastrianism, Hebrewism, Mohammedanism, Christianity--which is the  true religion?    Let us suppose for a moment that an inhabitant of Mars, if there be  such, were by a \"miracle\" to be transported to this earth and endowed  with the mental capacity of the average inhabitant of the earth (a thing  which perhaps would not be so flattering to our guest), were to be  approached by a zealot of each one of these faiths, who hoped to convert  this stranger to its ranks. Since the factor of coercion by force of  environment to which each of these earthlings was subject would  naturally be absent, the Martian would be in a position to make a fair  choice. How much would the visitor be impressed by the statements of the  Christian, Mohammedan, or Jew, when advised that unless he embraced  their particular creed, he would be damned to eternal torture in their  particular Hell?    If a Christian were to accost him and endeavor to put the fear of God  into him, and if our visitor, being from Mars, already knew that of the  world's population, only about 27 per cent are Christians, and the other  73 per cent are Non-Christians, is it logical to suppose that he would  ever be convinced that an omniscient, omnipotent, benevolent, Supreme  Being would select only one quarter of his children whom he had created  for redemption, with the infallible knowledge that nearly three-quarters  of them would be confined to Hell for not believing what He could have  made them believe if He were truly omnipotent, omniscient, and  benevolent? Would he not rather reply that on his planet such a \"Father\"  who would select some of his children for rewards, and maliciously  torture his other children, would not be designated as a God but a  Devil? Were the Martian to be further informed that each one of God's  children was represented in actual figures by hundreds of millions and  that these have been living on the planet Earth for hundreds of  thousands of years, and were the visitor to contemplate the vast  incomprehensible number of souls that have been confined to Hell by such  a father, might he not cut his visit short? He would be apt to repeat  with James Mill, \"Think of a being who would make a Hell, who would  create the human race with the infallible foreknowledge and therefore  with the intention that the great majority of them should be consigned  to horrible and everlasting torment.\" I believe that our guest would  assert that if such a Being actually existed and demanded worship, he  would certainly have revealed his true belief to the first man Adam, and  therefore saved his children an inestimable amount of suffering.    Were the visitor to be further pressed by the zealot with the vision of  eternal hell, I believe he would retort that there is no reason for God  to punish those who doubt or deny faith in His existence, since it is  His own doing; and if He desired each one of His children to worship Him  according to the precepts of a certain creed, He surely would have  instilled that creed into man's make-up together with the rest of his  characteristics. Undoubtedly, He would not esteem any creed which damned  the human intellect by cursing the doubts which are the necessary  consequence of its exercise, or the creed which cursed the moral faculty  by asserting the guilt of honest error.    If our visitor would but glance at the history, the evolution, of  religious beliefs, he would realize and soundly assert that all  religions are human in their origins, erroneous in their theories, and  ridiculous in their threats and rewards.          CHAPTER II    THE KORAN AND THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS        _The Jews emerge into history, not a nation of keen spiritual      aspirations and altruistic ethics, but that pagan people,      worshipping rocks, sheep and cattle, and spirits of caves and wells,      of whom the Old Testament, tending towards its higher ideal, gives      fragmentary but convincing evidence_.        JAMES T. SHOTWELL.        _Consider Jahveh. Cruel god of a horde of nomadic invaders settling      in a land of farmers, he had his images, ranging in elaboration from      an uncut mazzebah or asherah, to a golden bull. He was plural by      place and tribe and function. What did the prophetic movement do      with his sacred powers? It identified his taboos with a written      constitution_.        HORACE M. KALLEN.        _The mental attitude of these priest-dominated ancestors of ours is      amazing. They were like children in the hands of unscrupulous      teachers. In reading these old chronicles it is impossible not to be      shocked by the incongruity ever arising out of the juxtaposition of      theory and practice_.        LLEWELYN POWYS.      Our Martian visitor, having withstood the blasts of the Zealot, is  approached by a Mohammedan who places in his hands the Koran and tells  him that it is a divinely inspired revelation, as revealed by Allah  through his prophet, Mohammed. Having already had some experience with  earthly religionists, the Martian is disposed to avail himself of the  historical evidence regarding the life of Mohammed.    He finds that Mohammed, from all accounts, was a demagogue, a charlatan,  and a victim of mental disease. It strikes him strangely that such an  individual should be chosen by Allah as his disciple on earth to make  known his commands. He notes Mohammed's appearance on earth in 600 A.D.  and wonders why the Creator should have procrastinated for such a long  time; but decides to read the revelations anyhow.    He discovers that \"from the literary point of view, the Koran has little  merit. Declamation, repetition, puerility, a lack of logic, and  incoherence strike him at every turn. He finds it humiliating to the  human intellect to think that this mediocre literature has been the  subject of innumerable commentaries and that millions of men are still  wasting time in absorbing it.\"    A Hebrew next takes his turn at this obstinate guest and sets before him  the Old Testament. Again, the Martian is informed that it is an inspired  book actuated by God.    In his attempt to find the historical evidence corroborating this book,  the Martian finds that authentic history begins for the Israelites with  the constitution of Saul's monarchy about 1100 B.C. All that precedes  this--the deluge, the dispersal of mankind, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, the  captivity in Egypt, Moses, Joshua, and the conquest of Canaan, is more  or less mythical.    In the Old Testament, our Martian reads the first chapter, glances at  the chronology, and is immediately bewildered since he has a fair  knowledge of our scientific advances. As he reads on, he becomes aware  of a host of errors, contradictions, and manifest absurdities. When he  questions the zealous Hebrew, he comes in contact with what he is  informed is Concordism, which he perceives is a false science that  consists in determining, at any cost, a perfect harmony between modern  science and the knowledge possessed by God's people. He is thus told  that the days of creation were not days at all, but periods; although  the Bible mentions the morning and evening of each day. Delving further  in this most holy of revelations, he learns that God is represented in a  manner most unworthy of what such a being should be represented. He  finds the Lord walking in the cool of the evening, showing his hind  quarters to Moses, ordering abominable massacres, and punishing chiefs  who had not killed enough people. On further perusal, there is revealed,  \"A great deal of Oriental bombast, incoherence and absurdity, that the  marvels recounted are often ludicrous or grotesque.\"    In a chance moment, when the Hebrew had relaxed his hold for a second, a  vile heretic points out to the visitor (_Exodus XXII, 18_): \"Thou shalt  not suffer a witch to live!\" and explains the witchcraft delusion to  him.    From a comparison between Exodus XXXIV and Exodus XX, he is at a loss to  decipher which are the true commandments that the Lord gave to Moses.  The first five books of the Pentateuch, he finds, are attributed to  Moses, although they contain the account of the latter's death. On  inquiry, he learns that this"]]]
