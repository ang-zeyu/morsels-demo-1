Loosely woven linens can be obtained  specially suitable for drawn thread work. In any case, if there is  dressing in the new material, it must be well boiled before the  embroidery is commenced: this makes it much softer for stitching  through. Coloured linens are rarely satisfactory, a certain kind of blue  being almost the only exception. The safest plan is to keep to pure  white, or to the unbleached varieties that have a slightly grey or warm  tone about them. Wools, silks, and flax threads all look well upon a  linen ground; it is not usually in good taste to embroider with poor  thread upon a rich ground material, and, upon the other hand, gold  thread and floss demand silk or velvet rather than linen, though any  rule of this kind may on occasion be broken.    Velvet and satin make excellent backgrounds for rich work; they should  not be used unless of good quality. The pile of the best velvet is  shorter than that of poorer kinds, and so is easier to manipulate, which  is a further reason for using the best. It is in any case a difficult  material, so much so that work is often carried out on linen and  afterwards applied to a velvet ground. The modern velvets, even the best  of them, are for quality or colour not comparable with the old ones.    Silk of different kinds is largely employed, since it makes a suitable  ground for many kinds of embroidery. Twilled and damasked silks are much  used; in the last-named kind, patterns must be carefully chosen to suit  the particular purpose. A thick ribbed silk is rarely satisfactory for  embroidery purposes.    For working with silk thread, an untwisted floss takes the first place,  but it needs some skill in manipulation. Filofloss is somewhat similar,  but it has a slight twist in it, making it easier to work, though  producing a less satisfactory result. Filosel is useful for some kinds  of work, but it is a poorer quality of silk. The purse silks, and what  is called embroidery silk, are all excellent; they are tightly twisted  varieties of fine quality. There are various others in use; a visit to a  good embroidery depot will probably be the best means of finding out  about these and about materials in general.    Wools can be obtained in various thicknesses and twistings, each good in  their way. Some workers prefer a but slightly twisted wool; however,  examples of old wool work are to be found in which a finely twisted  variety is used with most satisfactory effect.    Flax threads can be obtained in very good colours, and are to be highly  recommended. There are various cottons procurable, either coloured or  white, that are good for marking and other embroidery purposes where an  evenly twisted thread is desirable.    Pearls and precious stones take their place in rich embroideries, also  various less expensive but pretty stones may often be made use of  effectively.    Beads are a fascinating material to work with; all kinds of pretty  things can be done with them, either sewing them upon a ground, knitting  or crocheting, or making use of a small bead loom. A good deal of the  ready-made bought bead work, that only requires a monotonous ground to  be filled in around an already worked pattern of sorts, is not at all  suggestive of its possibilities. Beads of both paste and glass can be  obtained in much greater variety than is usually known, from the most  minute in size to large varieties of all kinds of shapes and patterns,  the colours of most of them being particularly good. The larger  ornamental beads are useful in many ways, sometimes taking the place of  tassels or fringes.    Many kinds of most curious materials are at times brought into the  service of embroidery, but the above-mentioned ones are the most usual.          CHAPTER III    PATTERN DESIGNING      The Difficulties of Pattern Making--A Stock-in-Trade--Some    Principles upon which Patterns are Built Up--Spacing-Out--Nature and    Convention--Shading--Figure Work--Limitations--Colour.      A beginner sometimes experiences difficulty in preparing her own  patterns. A designer needs a wide knowledge of many subjects, which  necessitates much time being given to study; also drawing ability is  necessary to enable the worker to set down her ideas upon paper. For  much simple and pretty work, however, a slight acquaintance with drawing  and design is sufficient, and any one who can master the requisite  stitches can also acquire some knowledge of these two subjects.    The word design frightens some who do not know quite what it means or  entails. Perhaps they do not realise that the design has already been  begun when the object to be worked has been settled, and the material,  thread, and stitches have been decided upon--the rest comes in much the  same way, partly by a system of choice; as it is necessary to know what  materials there are which can be used, so must the chief varieties of  pattern be known from which choice can be made. All patterns are built  up on some fundamental plan, of which the number is comparatively small.  The ability to choose, plan, and arrange is in a greater or less degree  inherent in every one, so there should be, after all, no great  difficulty in the design. The necessary underlying qualities are--a nice  taste, freedom from affectation, an eye for colour and form, and, it  might be added, a fair share of common sense.    A pattern maker requires some stock-in-trade, and it is wise to collect  together a store of some well-classified design material of ascertained  value, ready to be drawn upon when required. A good knowledge of plants  and flowers is very necessary. This is best acquired by making careful  drawings from nature. In choosing flowers for embroidery purposes, the  best-known ones, such as the daisy, rose, or carnation, give more  pleasure to the observer than rare unrecognisable varieties. Figures,  birds, beasts, and such things as inscriptions, monograms, shields of  arms and emblems, all demand study and drawing, both from miscellaneous  examples and from embroideries.    The treatment of all these should be studied in old work, in order that  the curious conventions and all kinds of amusing and interesting ideas  that have gradually grown up in the past may still be made use of and  added to, instead of being cast aside in a wild endeavour after  something original. The student who collects a supply of the foregoing  materials will find she has considerably widened her knowledge during  the process, and is better prepared to make designs.    In making a pattern the first thing to be decided upon is some main  idea, the detail that is to carry it out must then be considered. This  latter may be of various types, such as flowers, foliage, figures,  animals, geometrical forms, interlacing strapwork, quatrefoils, &c.,  &c.; perhaps several of these _motifs_ may be combined together in the  same design.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    One of the simplest plans upon which a pattern can be arranged is that  of some form recurring at regular intervals over the surface. The  principle involved is repetition; an example of it is shown at fig. 10.  The form that is used here is a sprig of flower, but the repeating  element admits of infinite variation, it may be anything from a dot to  an angel.    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    Copes and chasubles, bedspreads and curtains, are often to be seen  decorated with some repeating form. Fig. 11 shows in outline a  conventional sprig that is repeated in this fashion over the surface of  a famous cope in Ely Cathedral. Fig. 12 is an example of a sprig of  flower taken from a XVIIth century embroidered curtain; similar bunches,  but composed of different flowers, recur at intervals over this hanging.    It may interest the practical worker to know what are the different  stitches used upon this figure. The petals of the top flower are in  chain stitch in gradated colouring, the centre is an open crossing of  chain surrounded by stamens in stem stitch in varied colour, the  outermost leaves are outlined in stem stitch with an open filling of  little crossed stitches. The petals of the lower flower are worked  similarly, and the centre is carried out in chain stitch and French  knots. The leaves are filled in with ingenious variations of these  stitches.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]    The repeating element is perhaps a symbolical figure, a heraldic shield,  or it may be some geometrical form that supplies the motive. Fig. 13 is  a conventional sprig of hawthorn that ornaments in this way an altar  frontal at Zanthen. It is by no means necessary that the element which  repeats should be always identical; so long as it is similar in size,  form, and general character it will probably be the more interesting if  variety is introduced.    The principle of repetition is again found in fig. 14, but with an  additional feature; a sprig of flower is used, with the further  introduction of diagonal lines, expressed by leaf sprays, which are  arranged so as to surround each flower and divide it from the adjoining  ones.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]    It is advisable to space out the required surface in some way before  commencing to draw out a pattern; for carrying out fig. 14 it would be  well to pencil out the surface as in fig. 15; a connection between these  two will be perceived at a glance. This spacing-out of the required  surface in one way or another is of great assistance, and may even prove  suggestive in the planning of the design. It helps the regularity of the  work, and order is essential in design as in most other things in life.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]    Another very usual expedient is that of introducing a main central form,  with others branching out on either side and symmetrically balancing  each other. An example of this is given in fig. 16. The symmetry may be  much more free than this; a tree is symmetrical taken as a whole, but  the two sides"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#4)"],[1,"so dark that perhaps the full meaning of it escaped me. But what I  seemed to see was a form, at first crouching low among trees or bushes  that were being threshed by a violent wind, then running very swiftly,  and constantly turning a pale face to look behind him, as if he feared  a pursuer: and, indeed, pursuers were following hard after him. Their  shapes were but dimly seen, their number--three or four, perhaps,  only guessed. I suppose they were on the whole more like dogs than  anything else, but dogs such as we have seen they assuredly were not.  Could I have closed my eyes to this horror, I would have done so at  once, but I was helpless. The last I saw was the victim darting  beneath an arch and clutching at some object to which he clung: and  those that were pursuing him overtook him, and I seemed to hear the  echo of a cry of despair. It may be that I became unconscious:  certainly I had the sensation of awaking to the light of day after an  interval of darkness. Such, in literal truth, Emily, was my vision--I  can call it by no other name--of this afternoon. Tell me, have I not  been the unwilling witness of some episode of a tragedy connected with  this very house?\"    The letter is continued next day. \"The tale of yesterday was not  completed when I laid down my pen. I said nothing of my experiences to  my uncle--you know, yourself, how little his robust common-sense would  be prepared to allow of them, and how in his eyes the specific remedy  would be a black draught or a glass of port. After a silent evening,  then--silent, not sullen--I retired to rest. Judge of my terror,  when, not yet in bed, I heard what I can only describe as a distant  bellow, and knew it for my uncle's voice, though never in my hearing  so exerted before. His sleeping-room is at the further extremity of  this large house, and to gain access to it one must traverse an  antique hall some eighty feet long and a lofty panelled chamber, and  two unoccupied bedrooms. In the second of these--a room almost devoid  of furniture--I found him, in the dark, his candle lying smashed on  the floor. As I ran in, bearing a light, he clasped me in arms that  trembled for the first time since I have known him, thanked God, and  hurried me out of the room. He would say nothing of what had alarmed  him. 'To-morrow, to-morrow,' was all I could get from him. A bed was  hastily improvised for him in the room next to my own. I doubt if his  night was more restful than mine. I could only get to sleep in the  small hours, when daylight was already strong, and then my dreams were  of the grimmest--particularly one which stamped itself on my brain,  and which I must set down on the chance of dispersing the impression  it has made. It was that I came up to my room with a heavy foreboding  of evil oppressing me, and went with a hesitation and reluctance I  could not explain to my chest of drawers. I opened the top drawer, in  which was nothing but ribbons and handkerchiefs, and then the second,  where was as little to alarm, and then, O heavens, the third and last:  and there was a mass of linen neatly folded: upon which, as I looked  with curiosity that began to be tinged with horror, I perceived a  movement in it, and a pink hand was thrust out of the folds and began  to grope feebly in the air. I could bear it no more, and rushed from  the room, clapping the door after me, and strove with all my force to  lock it. But the key would not turn in the wards, and from within the  room came a sound of rustling and bumping, drawing nearer and nearer  to the door. Why I did not flee down the stairs I know not. I  continued grasping the handle, and mercifully, as the door was plucked  from my hand with an irresistible force, I awoke. You may not think  this very alarming, but I assure you it was so to me.    \"At breakfast to-day my uncle was very uncommunicative, and I think  ashamed of the fright he had given us; but afterwards he inquired of  me whether Mr. Spearman was still in town, adding that he thought that  was a young man who had some sense left in his head. I think you  know, my dear Emily, that I am not inclined to disagree with him  there, and also that I was not unlikely to be able to answer his  question. To Mr. Spearman he accordingly went, and I have not seen him  since. I must send this strange budget of news to you now, or it may  have to wait over more than one post.\"    The reader will not be far out if he guesses that Miss Mary and Mr.  Spearman made a match of it not very long after this month of June.  Mr. Spearman was a young spark, who had a good property in the  neighbourhood of Whitminster, and not unfrequently about this time  spent a few days at the \"King's Head,\" ostensibly on business. But he  must have had some leisure, for his diary is copious, especially for  the days of which I am telling the story. It is probable to me that he  wrote this episode as fully as he could at the bidding of Miss Mary.    \"Uncle Oldys (how I hope I may have the right to call him so before  long!) called this morning. After throwing out a good many short  remarks on indifferent topics, he said 'I wish, Spearman, you'd listen  to an odd story and keep a close tongue about it just for a bit, till  I get more light on it.' 'To be sure,' said I, 'you may count on me.'  'I don't know what to make of it,' he said. 'You know my bedroom. It  is well away from every one else's, and I pass through the great hall  and two or three other rooms to get to it.' 'Is it at the end next the  minster, then?' I asked. 'Yes, it is: well, now, yesterday morning my  Mary told me that the room next before it was infested with some sort  of fly that the housekeeper couldn't get rid of. That may be the  explanation, or it may not. What do you think?' 'Why,' said I, 'you've  not yet told me what has to be explained.' 'True enough, I don't  believe I have; but by-the-by, what are these sawflies? What's the  size of them?' I began to wonder if he was touched in the head. 'What  I call a sawfly,' I said very patiently, 'is a red animal, like a  daddy-longlegs, but not so big, perhaps an inch long, perhaps less. It  is very hard in the body, and to me'--I was going to say 'particularly  offensive,' but he broke in, 'Come, come; an inch or less. That won't  do.' 'I can only tell you,' I said, 'what I know. Would it not be  better if you told me from first to last what it is that has puzzled  you, and then I may be able to give you some kind of an opinion.' He  gazed at me meditatively. 'Perhaps it would,' he said. 'I told Mary  only to-day that I thought you had some vestiges of sense in your  head.' (I bowed my acknowledgements.) 'The thing is, I've an odd kind  of shyness about talking of it. Nothing of the sort has happened to me  before. Well, about eleven o'clock last night, or after, I took my  candle and set out for my room. I had a book in my other hand--I  always read something for a few minutes before I drop off to sleep. A  dangerous habit: I don't recommend it: but I know how to manage my  light and my bed curtains. Now then, first, as I stepped out of my  study into the great half that's next to it, and shut the door, my  candle went out. I supposed I had clapped the door behind me too  quick, and made a draught, and I was annoyed, for I'd no tinder-box  nearer than my bedroom. But I knew my way well enough, and went on.  The next thing was that my book was struck out of my hand in the dark:  if I said twitched out of my hand it would better express the  sensation. It fell on the floor. I picked it up, and went on, more  annoyed than before, and a little startled. But as you know, that hall  has many windows without curtains, and in summer nights like these it  is easy to see not only where the furniture is, but whether there's  any one or anything moving, and there was no one--nothing of the kind.  So on I went through the hall and through the audit chamber next to  it, which also has big windows, and then into the bedrooms which lead  to my own, where the curtains were drawn, and I had to go slower  because of steps here and there. It was in the second of those rooms  that I nearly got my _quietus_. The moment I opened the door of it I  felt there was something wrong. I thought twice, I confess, whether I  shouldn't turn back and find another way there is to my room rather  than go through that one. Then I was ashamed of myself, and thought  what people call better of it, though I don't know about \"better\" in  this case. If I was to describe my experience exactly, I should say  this: there was a dry, light, rustling sound all over the room as I  went in, and then (you remember it was perfectly dark) something  seemed to rush at me, and there was--I don't know how to put it--a  sensation of long thin arms, or legs, or feelers, all about my face,  and neck, and body. Very little strength in them, there seemed to be,  but Spearman, I don't think I was ever more horrified or disgusted in  all my life, that I remember: and it does take something to put me  out. I roared out as loud as I could, and flung away my candle at  random, and, knowing I was near the window, I tore at the curtain and  somehow let in enough light to be able to see something waving which I  knew was an insect's leg, by the shape of it: but, Lord, what a size!  Why the beast must have been as tall as I am. And now you tell me  sawflies are an inch long or less. What do you make of it, Spearman?'    \"'For goodness sake finish your story first,' I said. 'I never heard  anything like it.' 'Oh,' said he, 'there's no more to tell. Mary ran  in with a light, and there was nothing there. I didn't tell her what  was the matter. I changed my room for last night, and I expect for  good.' 'Have you searched this odd room of yours?' I said. 'What do  you keep in it?' 'We don't use it,' he answered. 'There's an old press  there, and some little other furniture.' 'And in the press?' said I.  'I don't"]]]
