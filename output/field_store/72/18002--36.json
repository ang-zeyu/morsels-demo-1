[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17753"],[0,"On the Antiquity of the Chemical Art (#4)"],[1," The consideration of these coins of the  Graeco-Persian empire of the Seleucidae naturally leads us to the  consideration of the Persians.    I have already shown that the Greeks and Persians held intimate  relations with each other as early as the fourth century B.C., and from  the speech of Demosthenes against a proposed war with Persia, delivered  in 354 B.C, we may well believe that they had already had a long and  intimate connection with each other. The passage rends thus:-    \"All Greeks know that, so long as they regarded Persia as their common  enemy, they were at peace with each other, and enjoyed much prosperity,  but since they have looked upon the King (of Persia) as a friend, and  quarrelled about disputes with each other, they have suffered worse  calamities than any one could possibly imprecate upon them.\"    The Persian empire was founded by Cyrus, about B.C. 560, and rapidly  rose to be perhaps the greatest power of the world of that age. The rise  of the Persian empire is not unlike that of the Arabian power in regard  to the wide range of conquest achieved in a very limited period. Its  actual existence, from the foundation of the empire by Cyrus in B.C. 560  to the death of Darius III., was barely two centuries and a half.    Previous to the Persian empire there existed three principal powers in  Asia--the Medes, the Chaldaeans or Babylonish, and the Lydian. Of these  the Medes and Chaldaeans were the most ancient, and their joint power  would seem to have extended eastward as far as the Oxus and Indus.    Of these nations the Babylonians were the most highly civilized, and,  did time permit, we might find much that would interest and instruct in  examining the various facts relating to the arts and sciences amongst  these nations. We know that arts and sciences must have been diligently  cultivated amongst them, and that magic and astrology were held in high  repute.    That the Persians were well acquainted with other nations is shown  clearly from the remains of their great city of Persepolis, where the  sculptured figures represent many types of mankind--the negro, with  thick lips and flat nose, and with his crisp, wooly hair, clearly cut;  and the half-naked Indian, with his distinguishing features, being  easily singled out from many others.    Persia held sway over a huge district of India--the limits of this are  not known; but, in addition, they were well acquainted with a large  portion of the north-western part of India.    The traditions and historical records of the Persians are contained in  the famous series of writings culled the Zend-avesta. These writings  are, it is thought, of an age even before the Persian dynasty was  established; and it has been shown by the researches of M. Anguetil and  Sir W. Jones that there is indeed a great probability of the Zend having  been a dialect of the ancient Sanscrit language. In the vocabulary  attached to M. Anguetil's great work on the Zend-avesta no less than 60  to 70 per cent. of the words are said to be pure Sanscrit.    As the oldest known language of Persia was Chaldaeic, we are again thrown  back on Indian sources for the origin of the great book of the ancient  Persians. Even the name of the priests of the Persian religion of  Zoroaster, Mag or Magi, is of Sanscrit derivation.    The Persians kept up an enormous army, which was spread through all the  various provinces and Satrapies, and consisted in great part of paid  auxiliaries. In at least the later period of Persian power the Greeks  were preferred to all others, and in the time of Cyrus the Younger they  composed the flower of the Persian army, and were employed in  garrisoning most of the chief cities of Asia Minor.    The description given by Herodotus of the vast army and fleet prepared  for the expedition of Xerxes against the Greeks gives us an idea of the  extent of the Persian power, and of the wide range of countries and  nations over which they held sway. The review held on the Plain of  Doriscus was perhaps the greatest military spectacle ever beheld either  before or since. Herodotus enumerates no less than 56 different nations,  all of them in their national dress and arms. Besides the Persians there  were \"Medes and Bactrians; Libyans in war chariots with four horses;  Arabs on camels; Sagartians, wild huntsmen who employed, instead of the  usual weapons of the time, the lasso; the nomadic tribes of Bucharia and  Mongolia; Ethiopians in lions' skins, and Indians in cotton robes;  Phoenician sailors, and Greeks from Asia Minor.\" All these and many  others were there assembled by the despotic power of the Persian king.    The system of government employed by the Persians, and the constant  reports and tributes sent from every province to the central court of  the king, were well calculated to bring to it, as to a focus, the  curious lore of the various nations who came in contact with or were  subdued by them.    The Persians were famed for their knowledge of astronomy and astrology,  and were said \"to have anciently known the most wonderful powers of  nature, and to have therefore acquired great fame as magicians and  enchanters.\"    The close relation between the Persian religious traditions and those of  the Hindoos is very striking. According to Mohsan, \"The best informed  Persians, who professed the faith of Hu-shang as distinguished from that  of Zeratusht, believes that the first monarch of Iran, and, indeed, of  the whole world, was Mahabad (a word apparently Sanscrit), who divided  the people into four orders,--the religious, the military, the  commercial, and the servile, to which he assigned names unquestionably  the same as those now applied to the four primary classes of the  Hindoos.\"    They added, \"that he received from the Creator and promulgated amongst  men a _sacred book in a heavenly language_, to which the Musselman  author gives the _Arabic_ title of _Desatir_, or Regulations, but the  original name of which he has not mentioned; and that _fourteen  Mahabads_ had appeared, or would appear, in human shapes for the  government of this world.\"    \"Now when we know that the Hindoos believe in _fourteen Menus_, or  celestial persons with similar functions, the _first_ of whom left a  book of _regulations_, or divine ordinances, which they hold equal to  the _Veda_, and the language of which they believe to be that of the  gods, we can hardly doubt that the first corruption of the purest and  oldest religion was the system of _Indian_ theology invented by the  _Brahmins_ and prevalent in those territories where the book of Mahabad,  or Menu, is at this moment the standard of all religious and moral  duties.\"    Having established, then, the long and intimate nature of the Persian  intercourse with India, let us see how it bears on our more immediate  subject.    The works on medicine which are known to exist, and to have been written  in Persian, are not very many in number, but they cover a period of time  of nearly 400 years. The oldest of them is of the year 1392 A.D., and in  it and its successors there are long lists of Arabian authors whose  works had been consulted, and also various Indian works.    Greek physicians were in great request at the Persian court, and when  the daughter of the Emperor Aurelian was sent in marriage to the Persian  monarch, Sapor II., she had a number of Greek physicians in her train.  This king founded a new city called Jondisabour in honour of his Queen,  and owing to the settlement here of a number of Greek physicians, who  had, on account of religious differences, retired into Persia, this city  became celebrated as a medical school. Dr. Friend gives the names of  these as \"Damascius the Syrian, Simplicius of Cilicia, Diogenes of  Phaenicea, Isidorus of Gaza, and others, the most learned and greatest  philosophers of the age.\" It is thought by some authors that many of the  Arabian writers who belonged to the college of Baghdad were educated at  Jondisabour.    The district of Jondisabour is even yet one of the most nourishing in  Persia, and contains mines which still yield turquoise, salt, lead,  copper, antimony, iron, and marble.    During the reign of the Persian king Nooshirwan, his physician Barzoueh  made various journeys into India, one of which was specially for the  purpose of obtaining copies of Indian literature, and another to obtain  medicaments and herbs.    How to account for the strange fact that all schools of medicine which  have risen, flourished, and disappeared, have left some trace in  historical records, with the exception of that of India, is most  difficult, unless under the hypothesis that the language in which the  science and philosophy of India was recorded has been almost a sealed  book to the world, and is even now quite unintelligible to the people of  India itself, generally speaking, and that thus the only way in which  the results of the long ages of philosophic study, which unquestionably  have had a place in India, have only been known by this dark reflection  from the writings of Greek and Arabic writers, which were scattered  broadcast over the ancient world. The Greeks, we know, borrowed their  science largely from the Egyptians, both in respect to theology and  philosophy; and we might, with much profit, pursue the examination of  our subject amongst the records of that highly civilized amongst the  ancient nations.    Many authors have attempted to show that there is a wonderful  resemblance between the Egyptians and the Hindoos, the sculptures on the  monuments of the former are most wonderfully like those of India, and  the features, dress, and arms are all as like as may be.    Both nations had the various arts of weaving, dyeing, embroidering,  working in metals, and the manufacture of glass, and practised them with  but little difference in their methods.

Having now, I trust, given sufficient examples of how the deep roots of  national prejudice defy every effort and circumstance to eradicate them,  I shall hope that my readers will endeavour to banish from their minds  any early impressions they may have received inimical to the French, and  resolve only to judge them as they find them, as reason must suggest  that all prepossessions cherished against any people must powerfully  militate against the traveller's happiness during his sojourn amongst  them. I fear that I may have been considered rather prolix upon the  subject, but besides the motive to which I have already alluded, I  always have cherished a most anxious desire to soften as much as  possible all national animosities.          CHAPTER II.         Different routes from London to Paris.--Aspect of the city as first       presented to the English traveller, according to the road by which       he may enter.--Its extent, population, etc.      The first measure to be adopted after any one has decided upon visiting  Paris, is to provide himself with a passport, which he will procure at  the French Ambassador's office in Poland street, for which there is no  charge, but it is requisite to state by which port you mean to proceed;  but in order to leave some latitude for caprice, you may mention two  places, as Calais or Boulogne, or Dieppe or Havre, etc. There are now  many different means of travelling to Paris; that which was once the  most frequently adopted was by coach to Dover, then embarking for  Calais, as those are the two ports which present the shortest distance  between the two countries, being only about twenty-one miles apart; many  however prefer embarking at Dover at once for Boulogne, thus avoiding  about twenty-five miles by land from Calais to Boulogne, which certainly  does not afford a single object of interest, and the distance by sea is  only increased eight miles. Another route is by railway to Brighton,  then crossing to Dieppe, and which is certainly the straightest line of  any of the routes from London to Paris; but on account of there being  more sea, the distance is not generally performed in so short a period  as the other routes, from the uncertainty of the Ocean. It is not  therefore so much frequented by travellers as those on which they can  reckon with more accuracy; the same may be said of the route by  Southampton, which is performed by railway to that town, and afterwards  by steam-packet to Havre, which includes above a hundred miles by sea,  consequently but little resorted to as compared with the former routes.  There was another means of reaching Paris, and that was from London to  St. Vallery by sea; which being near Abbeville and only 33 leagues from  Paris, there was the least of land travelling, consequently it was the  cheapest if all went smoothly, and this line was often adopted by strict  economists, who however have frequently found themselves much  disappointed, as sometimes it happened they could not make the port, and  have either been obliged to put back and lie off Ramsgate, or lay to,  for some hours, and perhaps after having landed, have been detained at  St. Vallery, from not having been able to find places in the diligences  for Paris. This means, however, of proceeding to Paris no longer exists,  as the steamers have been sold, but it is thought that they will be  replaced by others. The route which is by far the most frequented is  that of embarking from London direct for Boulogne, and is on the long  run the most economical, and maybe comfortably performed, living  included, for three pounds, at the present prices, which are 1_l._ in  the best Cabin from London to Boulogne, then about 1_l._ 4_s._, in the  inside from Boulogne to Paris; and the other expenses will amount to  about fifteen or sixteen shillings; with respect to the charges on the  other routes, they are so often varying that it might only deceive the  reader by stating them as they at present exist, when in a few weeks  they may be higher or lower as circumstances may arise. Some persons  choose, the route by Southampton and Havre as being the most  picturesque, as from the latter town to Rouen such exquisite scenery is  presented by the banks of the Seine, as you pass in the steamer between  them, that the passenger is at a loss on which side to bestow his  attention, whilst rapidly hurried through so delightful and fertile a  country; in fact, he is tempted for once to regret the velocity of steam  conveyance, in not permitting him to tarry awhile to contemplate the  beautiful scenes by which he is environed. Rouen, where the traveller  should at least remain some days, is an object of great attraction. As  my work is especially devoted to Paris, I cannot afford much space to  the description of towns on the road; but as the city of Rouen is the  largest, the most interesting, and the most connected with history and  English associations of any upon the routes to Paris, I cannot pass it  over without some comment. Its boulevards first strike the English, as  being not only most picturesque and beautiful, but as presenting a scene  to them wholly novel, the noble vistas formed by towering trees,  mingling their branches, shading beneath their foliage many a cheerful  group, the merchant's stone villas, seen amongst their bowers, the high  shelving grassy banks, and the lively bustle that is ever going forward,  has so animated an effect that the beholder cannot but catch the  infection and feel his spirits elevated by the enlivening spectacle. But  what a contrast on entering the city; the streets narrow, dark, and with  no foot pavement, have a mean and gloomy appearance, but many of them  being built mostly of wood, carved into fantastic forms, offer a rich  harvest to the artist, and those of our own country have amply profited  by the innumerable picturesque objects which Rouen presents. The  cathedral, built by William the Conqueror, is one of the most  interesting monuments of France; the Church of St.-Ouen is at least as  beautiful, and there are several others which well repay the visiter for  the time he may expend in visiting them. The statue of the Maid of  Orleans stands in the _Marche aux Veaux_, on the spot where she was  burnt as a sorceress under the sanction of the Duke of Bedford in 1431.  Above all, the traveller must not fail to visit Mount Catherine, which  rises just above the city, and commands a view equally beautiful and  extensive. The delightful environs of Rouen are displayed before him,  comprising almost every scenic beauty that a country can afford; even  the factories, which in most places rather deform the view than  otherwise, are here so constructed as to contribute to its ornament,  more resembling villas than buildings solely for utility. Hills, wood,  water, bridges, chateaux, cottages, corn fields and meadows are so  picturesquely intermingled, that every object which can give charm to a  landscape is here united. There are several hills round Rouen which  present prospects nearly equal to that which is witnessed from Mount  Catherine, and in fact it is difficult to imagine any situation which  affords so many pleasant walks and such enchanting scenery. Indeed, all  the way to Paris by this route (that is by what is called the lower  road) which for a considerable distance runs within sight of the Seine,  the country is most highly interesting, passing through Louvier,  Gaillon, Vernon, Mantes and St. Germains.    Calais, as being the nearest point to the English coast, and at which we  so often obtain our first peep at France, merits some notice, and  although it offers but few attractions, and is surrounded by a flat  cheerless country, yet there are connected with it some associations  which are replete with interest; as who that has ever read Sterne's  Sentimental Journey can forget the simple but impressive description he  gives of the poor friar and other objects which he there met, and which  he has engraven on the minds of his readers, in his own peculiar style,  in characters never to be erased; for my part, as I first approached  Calais I thought but of Sterne and his plain, unvarnished tale, of the  trifles he encountered, around which he contrived to weave an interest  which is felt even by the inhabitants of Calais to this day; although  they knew his works but through the spoiling medium of translation,  still they never fail to exhibit to the Englishman the alcove in which  he is said to have written his adventures in Calais. As I entered the  town, instantly the works of Hogarth appeared before me, for who is  there that does not remember his excellent representation of the Gates  of Calais, with the meagre sentinel and still more skinny cook bending  under the weight of a dish crowned with an enormous sirloin of beef, no  doubt intended to regale some newly-arrived John Bull, whilst a fat monk  scans it with a longing eye. Next the bust of Eustache de St. Pierre  awakes the attention, and the surrender of Calais and his devoted  patriotism rises in one's memory. Another souvenir also must not be  forgotten, namely, the print of the foot of Louis the Eighteenth, which  is cut in the stone, and a piece of brass let in where he first stepped  on shore, and undoubtedly represents a very pretty little foot; but when  a Frenchman who was no amateur of the Bourbon dynasty was asked to  admire its symmetry, he observed it was very well, but that it would  look"]]]
