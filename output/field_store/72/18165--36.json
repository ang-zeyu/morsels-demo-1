He  had also accumulated an almost record series of racing debts,  besides as shady a gang of friends--for the most part vaguely  connected with the turf--as any young man of his age ever  contrived to collect.    These things try the most placid of parents; and finally Lord  Emsworth had put his foot down. It was the only occasion in his  life when he had acted with decision, and he did it with the  accumulated energy of years. He stopped his son's allowance,  haled him home to Blandings Castle, and kept him there so  relentlessly that until the previous night, when they had come up  together by an afternoon train, Freddie had not seen London for  nearly a year.    Possibly it was the reflection that, whatever his secret  troubles, he was at any rate once more in his beloved metropolis  that caused Freddie at this point to burst into discordant song.  He splashed and warbled simultaneously.    Lord Emsworth's frown deepened and he began to tap his fingers  together irritably. Then his brow cleared and a pleased smile  flickered over his face. He, too, had remembered.    What Lord Emsworth remembered was this: Late in the previous  autumn the next estate to Blandings had been rented by an  American, a Mr. Peters--a man with many millions, chronic  dyspepsia, and one fair daughter--Aline. The two families had  met. Freddie and Aline had been thrown together; and, only a few  days before, the engagement had been announced. And for Lord  Emsworth the only flaw in this best of all possible worlds had  been removed.    Yes, he was glad Freddie was engaged to be married to Aline  Peters. He liked Aline. He liked Mr. Peters. Such was the relief  he experienced that he found himself feeling almost affectionate  toward Freddie, who emerged from the bathroom at this moment,  clad in a pink bathrobe, to find the paternal wrath evaporated,  and all, so to speak, right with the world.    Nevertheless, he wasted no time about his dressing. He was always  ill at ease in his father's presence and he wished to be  elsewhere with all possible speed. He sprang into his trousers  with such energy that he nearly tripped himself up. As he  disentangled himself he recollected something that had slipped  his memory.    \"By the way, gov'nor, I met an old pal of mine last night and  asked him down to Blandings this week. That's all right, isn't  it? He's a man named Emerson, an American. He knows Aline quite  well, he says--has known her since she was a kid.\"    \"I do not remember any friend of yours named Emerson.\"    \"Well, as a matter of fact, I met him last night for the first  time. But it's all right. He's a good chap, don't you know!  --and all that sort of rot.\"    Lord Emsworth was feeling too benevolent to raise the objections  he certainly would have raised had his mood been less sunny.    \"Certainly; let him come if he wishes.\"    \"Thanks, gov'nor.\"    Freddie completed his toilet.    \"Doing anything special this morning, gov'nor? I rather thought  of getting a bit of breakfast and then strolling round a bit.  Have you had breakfast?\"    \"Two hours ago. I trust that in the course of your strolling you  will find time to call at Mr. Peters' and see Aline. I shall be  going there directly after lunch. Mr. Peters wishes to show me  his collection of--I think scarabs was the word he used.\"    \"Oh, I'll look in all right! Don't you worry! Or if I don't I'll  call the old boy up on the phone and pass the time of day. Well,  I rather think I'll be popping off and getting that bit of  breakfast--what?\"    Several comments on this speech suggested themselves to Lord  Emsworth. In the first place, he did not approve of Freddie's  allusion to one of America's merchant princes as \"the old boy.\"  Second, his son's attitude did not strike him as the ideal  attitude of a young man toward his betrothed. There seemed to be  a lack of warmth. But, he reflected, possibly this was simply  another manifestation of the modern spirit; and in any case it  was not worth bothering about; so he offered no criticism.    Presently, Freddie having given his shoes a flick with a silk  handkerchief and thrust the latter carefully up his sleeve, they  passed out and down into the main lobby of the hotel, where they  parted--Freddie to his bit of breakfast; his father to potter  about the streets and kill time until luncheon. London was always  a trial to the Earl of Emsworth. His heart was in the country and  the city held no fascinations for him.                            *   *   *    On one of the floors in one of the buildings in one of the  streets that slope precipitously from the Strand to the Thames  Embankment, there is a door that would be all the better for a  lick of paint, which bears what is perhaps the most modest and  unostentatious announcement of its kind in London. The grimy  ground-glass displays the words:                      R. JONES    Simply that and nothing more. It is rugged in its simplicity.  You wonder, as you look at it--if you have time to look at and  wonder about these things--who this Jones may be; and what is the  business he conducts with such coy reticence.    As a matter of fact, these speculations had passed through  suspicious minds at Scotland Yard, which had for some time taken  not a little interest in R. Jones. But beyond ascertaining that  he bought and sold curios, did a certain amount of bookmaking  during the flat-racing season, and had been known to lend money,  Scotland Yard did not find out much about Mr. Jones and presently  dismissed him from its thoughts.    On the theory, given to the world by William Shakespeare, that it  is the lean and hungry-looking men who are dangerous, and that  the \"fat, sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights,\" are  harmless, R. Jones should have been above suspicion. He was  infinitely the fattest man in the west-central postal district of  London. He was a round ball of a man, who wheezed when he walked  upstairs, which was seldom, and shook like jelly if some tactless  friend, wishing to attract his attention, tapped him unexpectedly  on the shoulder. But this occurred still less frequently than his  walking upstairs; for in R. Jones' circle it was recognized that  nothing is a greater breach of etiquette and worse form than to  tap people unexpectedly on the shoulder. That, it was felt,  should be left to those who are paid by the government to do it.    R. Jones was about fifty years old, gray-haired, of a mauve  complexion, jovial among his friends, and perhaps even more  jovial with chance acquaintances. It was estimated by envious  intimates that his joviality with chance acquaintances, specially  with young men of the upper classes, with large purses and small  foreheads--was worth hundreds of pounds a year to him. There was  something about his comfortable appearance and his jolly manner  that irresistibly attracted a certain type of young man. It was  his good fortune that this type of young man should be the type  financially most worth attracting.    Freddie Threepwood had fallen under his spell during his short  but crowded life in London. They had met for the first time at  the Derby; and ever since then R. Jones had held in Freddie's  estimation that position of guide, philosopher and friend which  he held in the estimation of so many young men of Freddie's  stamp.    That was why, at twelve o'clock punctually on this Spring day, he  tapped with his cane on R. Jones' ground glass, and showed such  satisfaction and relief when the door was opened by the  proprietor in person.    \"Well, well, well!\" said R. Jones rollickingly. \"Whom have we  here? The dashing bridegroom-to-be, and no other!\"    R. Jones, like Lord Emsworth, was delighted that Freddie was  about to marry a nice girl with plenty of money. The sudden  turning off of the tap from which Freddie's allowance had flowed  had hit him hard. He had other sources of income, of course; but  few so easy and unfailing as Freddie had been in the days of his  prosperity.    \"The prodigal son, by George! Creeping back into the fold after  all this weary time! It seems years since I saw you, Freddie.  The old gov'nor put his foot down--didn't he?--and stopped the  funds. Damned shame! I take it that things have loosened up a bit  since the engagement was announced--eh?\"    Freddie sat down and chewed the knob of his cane unhappily.    \"Well, as a matter of fact, Dickie, old top,\" he said, \"not so  that you could notice it, don't you know! Things are still pretty  much the same. I managed to get away from Blandings for a night,  because the gov'nor had to come to London; but I've got to go  back with him on the three-o'clock train. And, as for money, I  can't get a quid out of him. As a matter of fact, I'm in the  deuce of a hole; and that's why I've come to you.\"    Even fat, jovial men have their moments of depression. R. Jones'  face clouded, and jerky remarks about hardness of times and  losses on the Stock Exchange began to proceed from him. As  Scotland Yard had discovered, he lent money on occasion; but he  did not lend it to youths in Freddie's unfortunate position.    \"Oh, I don't want to make a touch, you know,\" Freddie hastened to  explain. \"It isn't that. As a matter of fact, I managed to raise  five hundred of the best this morning. That ought to be enough.\"    \"Depends on what you want it for,\" said R. Jones, magically genial  once more.    The thought entered his mind, as it had so often, that the world  was full of easy marks. He wished he could meet the money-lender  who had been rash enough to advance the Honorable Freddie five  hundred pounds. Those philanthropists cross our path too seldom.    Freddie felt in his pocket, produced a cigarette case, and from  it extracted a newspaper clipping.    \"Did you read about poor old Percy in the papers? The case, you  know?\"    \"Percy?\"    \"Lord"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],[0,"Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#4)"],[1,"horns (_loc. cit._, iii., 2, 663^b).    But there are other instances of correlation which seem to have taxed  even Aristotle's ingenuity beyond its powers. Thus he knew that all  animals (meaning viviparous quadrupeds) with no front teeth in the  upper jaw have cotyledons on their foetal membranes, and that most  animals which have front teeth in both jaws and no horns have no  cotyledons (_De Generatione_, ii., 7). He offers no explanation of  this, but accepts it as a fact.    We may conveniently refer here to one or two other ideas of Aristotle  regarding the causes of form. He makes the profound remark that the  possible range of form of an organ is limited to some extent by its  existing differentiation. Thus he explains the absence of external  (projecting) ears in birds and reptiles by the fact that their skin is  hard and does not easily take on the form of an external ear (_De  Partibus_, ii, 12). The fact of the inverse correlation is certain;  the explanation is, though very vague, probably correct.    In one passage of the _De Partibus_ Aristotle clearly enunciates the  principle of the division of labour, afterwards emphasised by H.  Milne-Edwards. In some insects, he says, the proboscis combines the  functions of a tongue and a sting, in others the tongue and the sting  are quite separate. \"Now it is better,\" he goes on, \"that one and the  same instrument shall not be made to serve several dissimilar ends;  but that there shall be one organ to serve as a weapon, which can then  be very sharp, and a distinct one to serve as a tongue, which can then  be of spongy texture and fit to absorb nutriment. Whenever, therefore,  Nature is able to provide two separate instruments for two separate  uses, without the one hampering the other, she does so, instead of  acting like a coppersmith who for cheapness makes a spit and  lampholder in one\" (iv., 6, 683^a).    (5) The first sentence of the _Historia Animalium_ formulates, with  that simplicity and directness which is so characteristic of  Aristotle, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous  parts, in the mass the distinction between tissues and organs. \"Some  parts of animals are simple, and these can be divided into like parts,  as flesh into pieces of flesh; others are compound, and cannot be  divided into like parts, as the hand cannot be divided into hands, nor  the face into faces. All the compound parts also are made up of simple  parts--the hand, for example, of flesh and sinew and bone\" (Cresswell,  _loc. cit_., p. I).    In the _De Partibus Animalium_ he broadens the conception by adding  another form of composition. \"Now there are,\" he says, \"three degrees  of composition; and of these the first in order, as all will allow, is  composition out of what some call the elements, such as earth, air,  water, fire.... The second degree of composition is that by which the  homogeneous parts of animals, such as bone, flesh, and the like, are  constituted out of the primary substances. The third and last stage is  the composition which forms the heterogeneous parts, such as face,  hand, and the rest\" (ii., 1, 646^a, trans. Ogle).    In the _Historia Animalium_ the homogeneous parts are divided into (1)  the soft and moist (or fluid), such as blood, serum, flesh, fat, suet,  marrow, semen, gall, milk, phlegm, faeces and urine, and (2) the hard  and dry (or solid), such as sinew, vein, hair, bone, cartilage, nail,  and horn. It would appear from this enumeration that Aristotle's  distinction of simple and complex parts does not altogether coincide  with our distinction of tissues and organs. We should not call vein a  tissue, nor do we include under this heading non-living secretions.  But in the _De Partibus Animalium_ Aristotle, while still holding to  the distinction set forth above, is alive to the fact that his simple  parts include several different sorts of substances. He distinguishes  among the homogeneous parts three sets. The first of these comprises  the tissues out of which the heterogeneous parts are constructed,  _e.g._, flesh and bone; the second set form the nutriment of the  parts, and are invariably fluid; while the third set are the residue  of the second and constitute the residual excretions of the body (ii.,  2, 647^b). He sees clearly the difficulty of calling vein or  blood-vessel a simple part, for while a bloodvessel and a part of it  are both blood-vessel, as we should say vascular tissue, yet a part of  a blood-vessel is not a bloodvessel. There is form superadded to  homogeneity of structure (ii., 2, 647^b). Similarly for the heart and  the other viscera. \"The heart, like the other viscera, is one of the  homogeneous parts; for, if cut up, its pieces are homogeneous in  substance with each other. But it is at the same time heterogeneous in  virtue of its definite configuration\" (ii., 1, 647^a, trans. Ogle).    Aristotle, therefore, came very near our conception of tissue. He was  of course not a histologist; he describes not the structure of  tissues, which he could not know, but rather their distribution within  the organism; his section on the homogeneous parts of Sanguinea  (_Historia Animalium_, iii., second half) is largely a comparative  topographical anatomy; in it, for instance, he describes the venous  and skeletal systems.    This distinction which Aristotle drew plays an important part in all  his writings on animals, particularly in his theory of development. It  was a distinction of immense value, and is full of meaning even at the  present day. No one has ever given a better definition of organ than  is implied in Aristotle's description of the heterogeneous parts--\"The  capacity of action resides in the compound parts\" (Cresswell, _loc.  cit._, p. 7). The heterogeneous parts were distinguished by the  faculty of doing something, they were the active or executive parts.  The homogeneous parts were distinguished mainly by physical characters  (_De Generatione_, i., 18), but certain of them had other than purely  physical properties, they were the organs of touch (_De Partibus_,  ii., 1, 647^a).    (6) In a passage in the _De Generatione_ (ii, 3) Aristotle says that  the embryo is an animal before it is a particular animal, that the  general characters appear before the special. This is a foreshadowing  of the essential point in von Baer's law (see Chap. IX. below).    He considers also that tissues arise before organs. The homogeneous  parts are anterior genetically to the heterogeneous parts and  posterior to the elementary material (_De Partibus_, ii., 1, 646^b).    (7) We meet in Aristotle an idea which later acquired considerable  vogue, that of the _Echelle des etres_(or \"scale of beings\"), that  organisms, or even all objects organic or inorganic, can be arranged  in a single ascending series. The idea is a common one; its first  literary expression is found perhaps in primitive creation-myths, in  which inorganic things are created before organic, and plants before  animals. It may be recognised also in Anaximander's theory that land  animals arose from aquatic animals, more clearly still in Anaxagoras'  theory that life took its origin on this globe from vegetable germs  which fell to earth with the rain. Anaxagoras considered animals  higher in the scale than plants, for while the latter participated in  pleasure (when they grew) and pain (when they lost their leaves),  animals had in addition \"Nous.\" In Empedocles' theory of evolution,  the vegetable world preceded the animal. Plato, in the _Timaeus_,  describes the whole organic world as being formed by degradation from  man, who is created first. Man sinks first into woman, then into brute  form, traversing all the stages from the higher to the lower animals,  and becoming finally a plant. This is a reversal of the more usual  notion, but the idea of gradation is equally present.    Aristotle seems not to have believed in any transformation of species,  but he saw that Nature passes gradually from inanimate to animate  things without a clear dividing line. \"The race of plants succeeds  immediately that of inanimate objects\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p.  94). Within the organic realm the passage from plants to animals is  gradual. Some creatures, for example, the sea-anemones and sponges,  might belong to either class.    Aristotle recognised also a natural series among the groups of  animals, a series of increasing complexity of structure. He begins his  study of structure with man, who is the most intricate, and then takes  up in turn viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, then birds, then  fishes. After the Sanguinea he considers the Exsanguinea, and of the  latter first the most highly organised, the Cephalopods, and last the  simplest, the lower members of his class of the Testacea. In treating  of generation (in _Hist. Animalium_, v.) he reverses this order. In  the _De Generatione_ (Book ii., I) there is given another serial  arrangement of animals, this time in relation to their manner of  reproduction. There is a gradation, he says, of the following kind:--    1. Internally viviparous Sanguinea  } producing a perfect  2. Externally viviparous Sanguinea  }       animal.  3. Oviparous Sanguinea--producing a perfect egg.  4. Animals producing an imperfect egg (one which       increases in size after being laid).  5. Insects, producing a scolex (or grub).    In Aristotle's view the gradation of organic forms is the consequence,  not the cause, of the gradation observable in their activities. Plants  have no work to do beside nutrition, growth, and reproduction; they  possess only the nutritive soul. Animals possess in addition sensation  and the sensitive or perceptive soul--\"their manner of life differs in  their having pleasure in sexual intercourse, in their mode of  parturition and rearing their young\" (_Hist. Anim._, viii., trans.  Cresswell, p. 195). Man alone has the rational soul in addition to the  two lower kinds.    As"]]]
