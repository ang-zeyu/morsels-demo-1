[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#4)"],[1,"had in their collective contributions  to the propagation of the Cause of Baha'u'llah. I can only for the moment  cite at random certain of these opportunities which stand out  preeminently, in any attempt to survey the possibilities of the future:  The election of the International House of Justice and its establishment  in the Holy Land, the spiritual and administrative center of the Baha'i  world, together with the formation of its auxiliary branches and  subsidiary institutions; the gradual erection of the various dependencies  of the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the West, and the intricate issues  involving the establishment and the extension of the structural basis of  Baha'i community life; the codification and promulgation of the ordinances  of the Most Holy Book, necessitating the formation, in certain countries  of the East, of properly constituted and officially recognized courts of  Baha'i law; the building of the third Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the Baha'i  world in the outskirts of the city of Tihran, to be followed by the rise  of a similar House of Worship in the Holy Land itself; the deliverance of  Baha'i communities from the fetters of religious orthodoxy in such Islamic  countries as Persia, 'Iraq, and Egypt, and the consequent recognition, by  the civil authorities in those states, of the independent status and  religious character of Baha'i National and Local Assemblies; the  precautionary and defensive measures to be devised, coordinated, and  carried out to counteract the full force of the inescapable attacks which  the organized efforts of ecclesiastical organizations of various  denominations will progressively launch and relentlessly pursue; and, last  but not least, the multitudinous issues that must be faced, the obstacles  that must be overcome, and the responsibilities that must be assumed, to  enable a sore-tried Faith to pass through the successive stages of  unmitigated obscurity, of active repression, and of complete emancipation,  leading in turn to its being acknowledged as an independent Faith,  enjoying the status of full equality with its sister religions, to be  followed by its establishment and recognition as a State religion, which  in turn must give way to its assumption of the rights and prerogatives  associated with the Baha'i state, functioning in the plenitude of its  powers, a stage which must ultimately culminate in the emergence of the  worldwide Baha'i Commonwealth, animated wholly by the spirit, and  operating solely in direct conformity with the laws and principles of  Baha'u'llah.    The challenge offered by these opportunities the American believers, I  feel confident, will, in addition to their answer to the teaching call  voiced by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablets, unhesitatingly take up, and will,  with their traditional fearlessness, tenacity, and efficiency, so respond  to it as to confirm, before all the world, their title and rank as the  champion-builders of the mightiest institutions of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah.    Dearly beloved friends! Though the task be long and arduous, yet the prize  which the All-Bountiful Bestower has chosen to confer upon you is of such  preciousness that neither tongue nor pen can befittingly appraise it.  Though the goal towards which you are now so strenuously striving be  distant, and as yet undisclosed to men's eyes, yet its promise lies firmly  embedded in the authoritative and unalterable utterances of Baha'u'llah.  Though the course He has traced for you seems, at times, lost in the  threatening shadows with which a stricken humanity is now enveloped, yet  the unfailing light He has caused to shine continually upon you is of such  brightness that no earthly dusk can ever eclipse its splendor. Though  small in numbers, and circumscribed as yet in your experiences, powers,  and resources, yet the Force which energizes your mission is limitless in  its range and incalculable in its potency. Though the enemies which every  acceleration in the progress of your mission must raise up be fierce,  numerous, and unrelenting, yet the invisible Hosts which, if you  persevere, must, as promised, rush forth to your aid, will, in the end,  enable you to vanquish their hopes and annihilate their forces. Though the  ultimate blessings that must crown the consummation of your mission be  undoubted, and the Divine promises given you firm and irrevocable, yet the  measure of the goodly reward which every one of you is to reap must depend  on the extent to which your daily exertions will have contributed to the  expansion of that mission and the hastening of its triumph.            \"DEARLY BELOVED FRIENDS! GREAT AS IS MY LOVE AND ADMIRATION ...\"      Dearly beloved friends! Great as is my love and admiration for you,  convinced as I am of the paramount share which you can, and will,  undoubtedly have in both the continental and international spheres of  future Baha'i activity and service, I feel it nevertheless incumbent upon  me to utter, at this juncture, a word of warning. The glowing tributes, so  repeatedly and deservedly paid to the capacity, the spirit, the conduct,  and the high rank, of the American believers, both individually and as an  organic community, must, under no circumstances, be confounded with the  characteristics and nature of the people from which God has raised them  up. A sharp distinction between that community and that people must be  made, and resolutely and fearlessly upheld, if we wish to give due  recognition to the transmuting power of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, in its  impact on the lives and standards of those who have chosen to enlist under  His banner. Otherwise, the supreme and distinguishing function of His  Revelation, which is none other than the calling into being of a new race  of men, will remain wholly unrecognized and completely obscured.    How often have the Prophets of God, not excepting Baha'u'llah Himself,  chosen to appear, and deliver their Message in countries and amidst  peoples and races, at a time when they were either fast declining, or had  already touched the lowest depths of moral and spiritual degradation. The  appalling misery and wretchedness to which the Israelites had sunk, under  the debasing and tyrannical rule of the Pharaohs, in the days preceding  their exodus from Egypt under the leadership of Moses; the decline that  had set in in the religious, the spiritual, the cultural, and the moral  life of the Jewish people, at the time of the appearance of Jesus Christ;  the barbarous cruelty, the gross idolatry and immorality, which had for so  long been the most distressing features of the tribes of Arabia and  brought such shame upon them when Muhammad arose to proclaim His Message  in their midst; the indescribable state of decadence, with its attendant  corruption, confusion, intolerance, and oppression, in both the civil and  religious life of Persia, so graphically portrayed by the pen of a  considerable number of scholars, diplomats, and travelers, at the hour of  the Revelation of Baha'u'llah--all demonstrate this basic and inescapable  fact. To contend that the innate worthiness, the high moral standard, the  political aptitude, and social attainments of any race or nation is the  reason for the appearance in its midst of any of these Divine Luminaries  would be an absolute perversion of historical facts, and would amount to a  complete repudiation of the undoubted interpretation placed upon them, so  clearly and emphatically, by both Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha.    How great, then, must be the challenge to those who, belonging to such  races and nations, and having responded to the call which these Prophets  have raised, to unreservedly recognize and courageously testify to this  indubitable truth, that not by reason of any racial superiority, political  capacity, or spiritual virtue which a race or nation might possess, but  rather as a direct consequence of its crying needs, its lamentable  degeneracy, and irremediable perversity, has the Prophet of God chosen to  appear in its midst, and with it as a lever has lifted the entire human  race to a higher and nobler plane of life and conduct. For it is precisely  under such circumstances, and by such means that the Prophets have, from  time immemorial, chosen and were able to demonstrate their redemptive  power to raise from the depths of abasement and of misery, the people of  their own race and nation, empowering them to transmit in turn to other  races and nations the saving grace and the energizing influence of their  Revelation.    In the light of this fundamental principle it should always be borne in  mind, nor can it be sufficiently emphasized, that the primary reason why  the Bab and Baha'u'llah chose to appear in Persia, and to make it the  first repository of their Revelation, was because, of all the peoples and  nations of the civilized world, that race and nation had, as so often  depicted by 'Abdu'l-Baha, sunk to such ignominious depths, and manifested  so great a perversity, as to find no parallel among its contemporaries.  For no more convincing proof could be adduced demonstrating the  regenerating spirit animating the Revelations proclaimed by the Bab and  Baha'u'llah than their power to transform what can be truly regarded as  one of the most backward, the most cowardly, and perverse of peoples into  a race of heroes, fit to effect in turn a similar revolution in the life  of mankind. To have appeared among a race or nation which by its intrinsic  worth and high attainments seemed to warrant the inestimable privilege of  being made the receptacle of such a Revelation would in the eyes of an  unbelieving world greatly reduce the efficacy of that Message, and detract  from the self-sufficiency of its omnipotent power. The contrast so  strikingly presented in the pages of Nabil's Narrative between the heroism  that immortalized the life and deeds of the Dawn-Breakers and the  degeneracy and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19250"],[0,"`Abdu'l-Bahá in London (#4)"],[1,"by Professor Sadler,  'Abdu'l-Baha closed the meeting by giving his blessing in undulating  rhythmic tones.    By the time these lines appear 'Abdu'l-Baha Abbas will have left our  shores, but the memory of his gracious personality is a permanent  possession. His influence will be felt for many days to come, and has  already done much to promote that union of East and West for which many  have long yearned.            10 CHENISTON GARDENS LONDON W.          The subjoined notes are taken from \"The Quarterly Record of      'Higher Thought' Work,\" November 1911.      One of the most interesting and significant events which have taken place,  has been the visit of 'Abdu'l-Baha to London. The Persian Mage whose life,  passed in prison, has been spent in promoting peace and unity by the one  certain method of aiding individual spiritual development, must in a very  real sense have \"tasted of the travail of his soul and been satisfied\".  Not only was he visited privately by nearly every earnest truth-seeker and  leader of high thought in London, but his message was made known to  thousands who had but dimly heard his name before.    The Higher Thought Centre was well known to 'Abdu'l-Baha as the place  where the Baha'is held their weekly meetings under the direction of Miss  Rosenberg, and an invitation to the Centre was accepted by him just two  days before his departure. Through his interpreter 'Abdu'l-Baha gave a  kindly greeting and a short impressive address, dwelling on the  blessedness of such an assembly gathered in a spirit of unity and  spiritual aspiration. He concluded with a lowly uttered fervent prayer in  his own tongue, and a benediction which all present felt to be very real.    On the following day a message was conveyed to the Centre from  'Abdu'l-Baha signifying the fullest appreciation of all kindness shown to  the Baha'is, and concluding with these words; \"it matters not what name  each calls himself--The Great Work is One.\"    \"Christ is ever in the world of existence. He has never disappeared out of  it.... Rest assured that Christ is present. The Spiritual beauty we see  around us today is from the breathings of Christ.\"            A MESSAGE FROM 'ABDU'L-BAHA      Written for The Christian Commonwealth and published September 29th, 1911.      God sends Prophets for the education of the people and the progress of  mankind. Each such Manifestation of God has raised humanity. They serve  the whole world by the bounty of God. The sure proof that they are the  Manifestations of God is in the education and progress of the people. The  Jews were in the lowest condition of ignorance, and captives under Pharaoh  when Moses appeared and raised them to a high state of civilization. Thus  was the reign of Solomon brought about and science and art were made known  to mankind. Even Greek philosophers became students of Solomon's teaching.  Thus was Moses proved to be a Prophet.    After the lapse of time the Israelites deteriorated, and became subject to  the Romans and the Greeks. Then the brilliant Star of Jesus rose from the  horizon upon the Israelites, brightening the world, until all sects and  creeds and nations were taught the beauty of unity. There cannot be any  better proof than this that Jesus was the Word of God.    So it was with the Arabian nations who, being uncivilized, were oppressed  by the Persian and Greek governments. When the Light of Muhammad shone  forth all Arabia was brightened. These oppressed and degraded peoples  became enlightened and cultured; so much so, indeed, that other nations  imbibed Arabian civilization from Arabia. This was the proof of Muhammad's  divine mission.    All the teaching of the Prophets is one; one faith; one Divine light  shining throughout the world. Now, under the banner of the oneness of  humanity all people of all creeds should turn away from prejudice and  become friends and believers in all the Prophets. As Christians believe in  Moses, so the Jews should believe in Jesus. As the Muhammadans believe in  Christ and Moses, so likewise the Jews and the Christians should believe  in Muhammad. Then all disputes would disappear, all then would be united.  Baha'u'llah came for this purpose. He has made the three religions one. He  has uplifted the standard of the oneness of faith and the honour of  humanity in the centre of the world. Today we must gather round it, and  try with heart and soul to bring about the union of mankind.            DISCOURSE GIVEN AT MISS E. J. ROSENBERG'S UNITY MEETING.                                 September 8th, 1911.      Praise be to God, that such a meeting of purity and steadfastness is being  held in London. The hearts of those present are pure, and are turned  towards the Kingdom of God. I hope that all that is contained and  established in the Holy books of God may be realized in you. The  Messengers of God are the principal and the first teachers. Whenever this  world becomes dark, and divided in its opinions and indifferent, God will  send one of His Holy Messengers.    Moses came during a time of darkness, when ignorance and childishness  prevailed amongst the people, and they were waverers. Moses was the  teacher of God; He gave the teachings of holiness and educated the  Israelites. He raised up the people from their degradation and caused them  to be highly honoured. He taught them Sciences and Arts, trained them in  civilization and increased their human virtues. After a while, that which  they had thus received from God was lost; the way was prepared for the  return of evil qualities, and the world was oppressed by tyranny.    Then again the rumour of the Light of Reality and the breathing of the  Holy Spirit became known. The cloud of Bounty showered, the Light of  Guidance shone upon the earth. The world put on a new garment, the people  became a new people, the oneness of humanity was proclaimed. The great  unity of thought transformed humanity and created a new world. Again,  after a time, all this was forgotten by the people. The teachings of God  no longer influenced their lives. His prophecies and commandments became  fainter and were finally obliterated from their hearts, and tyranny and  thoughtlessness once more prevailed.    Baha'u'llah then came and once more renewed the foundation of Faith. He  brought back the teachings of God, and the humane practices of the time of  Christ. He quenched the thirst of the thirsty, He awakened the careless  and called the attention of the heedless to the Divine secrets. He  declared the unity of humanity, and spread abroad the teaching of the  equality of all men.    Therefore, all of you ought with your hearts and minds to endeavour to win  the people with kindness, so that this great Unity may be established,  that childish superstitions may pass away, and all may become one.            DISCOURSE AT MRS. THORNBURGH-CROPPER'S                                September 13th, 1911.      'Abdu'l-Baha said:--Thanks be to God, this is a good meeting. It is very  enlightened, it is spiritual.    As a Persian Poet has written:--\"The Celestial Universe is so formed that  the under world reflects the upper world.\" That is to say whatever exists  in heaven is reflected in this phenomenal world. Now, praise be to God,  this meeting of ours is a reflection of the heavenly concourse; it is as  though we had taken a mirror and had gazed into it. This reflection from  the heavenly concourse we know as love.    As heavenly love exists in the supreme concourse even so it is reflected  here. The supreme concourse is filled with the desire for God--thank God,  this desire is also here.    Therefore if we say that this meeting is heavenly, it is true. Why?  Because we have no other desire except for that which comes from God. We  have no other object save the commemoration of God.    Some of the people of the earth desire conquest over others: some of them  are longing for rest and ease; others desire a high position; some desire  to become famous:--thank God our desire is for spirituality and for union  with God.    Now that we are gathered here our wish is to raise the banner of the Unity  of God, to spread the Light of God, to make the hearts of the people turn  to the Kingdom. Therefore I thank God that He is causing us to do this  great work.    I pray for all of you, that you may become celestial warriors, that you  may everywhere spread the Unity of God and enlighten the East and West,  and that you may give to all hearts the love of God. This is my utmost  desire, and I pray to God that your desire may be the same.    I am very happy to be with you all. I am pleased with the English King and  Government, and with the people.    You may thank God that in this land you are so free. You do not know what  lack of freedom there is in the East. When anyone comes to this country he  is content.    I wish God's protection for you all. Goodbye to you all.            DISCOURSE BY 'ABDU'L-BAHA GIVEN AT THE UNITY MEETING OF MISSES JACK AND  HERRICK.                                September 22nd, 1911.      It is a cold and miserable day but as I was anxious to see you I came  here. For a man who has love, effort is a rest. He will travel any  distance to visit his friends.    Thank God I see you spiritual and at rest; I give you this message from  God; that you must be turned toward Him. Praise God that you are near Him!  The unworthy things of this world have not deterred you from seeking the  world of Spirit. When in harmony with that world, you care not for the  things that perish; your desire is for that which never dies and the  Kingdom lies open before you. I hope that the teaching of God will spread  throughout the world, and will cause all to be united.    In the time of Jesus Christ there was an outpouring of the Light from East  to West that brought the people under a heavenly banner and illumined them  with divine insight. Western lands have been kindled by the Light"]]]
