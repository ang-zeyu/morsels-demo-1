Two violent attacks he was obliged this session to sustain, one from the  earl of Bristol, another from the house of commons.    As long as James lived, Bristol, secure of the concealed favor of that  monarch, had expressed all duty and obedience; in expectation that an  opportunity would offer of reinstating himself in his former credit and  authority. Even after Charles's accession he despaired not. He submitted  to the king's commands of remaining at his country seat, and of  absenting himself from parliament. Many trials he made to regain  the good opinion of his master; but finding them all fruitless, and  observing Charles to be entirely governed by Buckingham, his implacable  enemy, he resolved no longer to keep any measures with the court. A new  spirit he saw, and a new power arising in the nation; and to these he  was determined for the future to trust for his security and protection.    When the parliament was summoned, Charles, by a stretch of prerogative,  had given orders that no writ, as is customary, should be sent to  Bristol.[*] That nobleman applied to the house of lords by petition; and  craved their good offices with the king for obtaining what was his due  as a peer of the realm. His writ was sent him, but accompanied with  a letter from the lord keeper Coventry, commanding him, in the king's  name, to absent himself from parliament. This letter Bristol conveyed  to the lords, and asked advice how to proceed in so delicate a  situation.[**] The king's prohibition was withdrawn, and Bristol took  his seat. Provoked at these repeated instances of vigor, which the court  denominated contumacy, Charles ordered his attorney-general to enter an  accusation of high treason against him. By way of recrimination, Bristol  accused Buckingham of high treason. Both the earl's defence of himself  and accusation of the duke remain;[***] and, together with some original  letters still extant, contain the fullest and most authentic account  of all the negotiations with the house of Austria. From the whole, the  great imprudence of the duke evidently appears, and the sway of his  ungovernable passions; but it would be difficult to collect thence any  action which, in the eye of the law, could be deemed a crime, much less  could subject him to the penalty of treason.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 236.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 237.

The house, after  having voted, upon some queries of Dr. Turner's, \"that common fame was  a sufficient ground of accusation by the commons,\"[*] proceeded to frame  regular articles against Buckingham. They accused him of having united  many offices in his person; of having bought two of them; of neglecting  to guard the seas, insomuch that many merchant ships had fallen into the  hands of the enemy; of delivering ships to the French king in order to  serve against the Hugonots; of being employed in the sale of honors and  offices; of accepting extensive grants from the crown; of procuring many  titles of honor for his kindred; and of administering physic to the late  king without acquainting his physicians. All these articles appear, from  comparing the accusation and reply, to be either frivolous or false,  or both.[**] The only charge which could be regarded as important, was,  that he had extorted a sum of ten thousand pounds from the East India  company, and that he had confiscated some goods belonging to French  merchants, on pretence of their being the property of Spanish. The  impeachment never came to a full determination; so that it is difficult  for us to give a decisive opinion with regard to these articles: but it  must be confessed that the duke's answer in these particulars, as in all  the rest, is so clear and satisfactory, that it is impossible to refuse  our assent to it.[***] His faults and blemishes were, in many respects,  very great; but rapacity and avarice were vices with which he was  entirely unacquainted.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 217.

It is remarkable that the commons, though so much at a loss to  find articles of charge against Buckingham, never adopted Bristol's  accusation, or impeached the duke for his conduct in the Spanish treaty,  the most blamable circumstance in his whole life. He had reason to  believe the Spaniards sincere in their professions; yet, in order to  gratify his private passions, he had hurried his master and his  country into a war pernicious to the interests of both. But so rivetted  throughout the nation were the prejudices with regard to Spanish deceit  and falsehood, that very few of the commons seem as yet to have been  convinced that they had been seduced by Buckingham's narrative: a  certain proof that a discovery of this nature was not, as is imagined by  several historians, the cause of so sudden and surprising a variation in  the measures of the parliament.[*] [1]    While the commons were thus warmly engaged against Buckingham, the king  seemed desirous of embracing every opportunity by which he could express  a contempt and disregard for them. No one was at that time sufficiently  sensible of the great weight which the commons bore in the balance of  the constitution. The history of England had never hitherto afforded one  instance where any great movement or revolution had proceeded from  the lower house. And as their rank, both considered in a body and as  individuals, was but the second in the kingdom, nothing less than fatal  experience could engage the English princes to pay a due regard to the  inclinations of that formidable assembly.    The earl of Suffolk, chancellor of the university of Cambridge, dying  about this time, Buckingham, though lying under impeachment was yet, by  means of court interest, chosen in his place. The commons resented and  loudly complained of this affront; and the more to enrage them, the king  himself wrote a letter to the university, extolling the duke, and giving  them thanks for his election.[**]    The lord keeper, in the king's name, expressly commanded the house not  to meddle with his minister and servant, Buckingham; and ordered them to  finish, in a few days, the bill which they had begun for the subsidies,  and to make some addition to them; otherwise they must not expect to sit  any longer.[***] And though these harsh commands were endeavored to  be explained and mollified, a few days after, by a speech of  Buckingham's,[****] they failed not to leave a disagreeable impression  behind them.         * See note A, at the end of the volume.         ** Rush worth, vol. i. p. 371.         *** Parliament.

Besides a more stately style which Charles in general affected to  this parliament than to the last, he went so far, in a message, as to  threaten the commons that, if they did not furnish him with supplies, he  should be obliged to try new \"counsels.\" This language was sufficiently  clear: yet lest any ambiguity should remain, Sir Dudley Carleton,  vice-chamberlain, took care to explain it. \"I pray you, consider,\" said  he, \"what these new counsels are, or may be. I fear to declare those  that I conceive. In all Christian kingdoms, you know that parliaments  were in use anciently, by which those kingdoms were governed in a most  flourishing manner; until the monarchs began to know their own strength,  and seeing the turbulent spirit of their parliaments, at length they,  by little and little, began to stand on their prerogatives, and at last  overthrew the parliaments, throughout Christendom, except here only  with us. Let us be careful then to preserve the king's good opinion of  parliaments, which bringeth such happiness to this nation, and makes us  envied of all others, while there is this sweetness between his majesty  and the commons; lest we lose the repute of a free people by our  turbulency in parliament.\"[*] These imprudent suggestions rather gave  warning than struck terror. A precarious liberty, the commons thought,  which was to be preserved by unlimited complaisance, was no liberty  at all. And it was necessary, while yet in their power, to secure the  constitution by such invincible barriers, that no king or minister  should ever, for the future, dare to speak such a language to any  parliament, or even entertain such a project against them.    Two members of the house, Sir Dudley Digges and Sir John Elliot, who  had been employed as managers of the impeachment against the duke, were  thrown into prison.[**] The commons immediately declared, that they  would proceed no further upon business till they had satisfaction  in their privileges. Charles alleged, as the reason of this measure,  certain seditious expressions, which, he said, had, in their accusation  of the duke, dropped from these members. Upon inquiry, it appeared that  no such expressions had been used.[***] The members were released; and  the king reaped no other benefit from this attempt than to exasperate  the house still, and to show some degree of precipitancy and  indiscretion.    Moved by this example, the house of peers were roused from their  inactivity; and claimed liberty for the earl of Arundel, who had been  lately confined in the Tower. After many fruitless evasions, the king,  though somewhat ungracefully, was at last obliged to comply.[****] And  in this incident it sufficiently appeared, that the lords,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19216"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part F. (#4)"],[1,"violent measure. He represented that it was the loyalty  of the Scottish nation which had engaged them in an opposition to the  English rebels; and to take advantage of the calamities into which,  on that account, they had fallen, would be regarded as the highest  injustice and ingratitude: that the spirit of that people was now fully  subdued by the servitude under which the usurpers had so long held them,  and would of itself yield to any reasonable compliance with their  legal sovereign, if, by this means, they recovered their liberty and  independence: that the attachment of the Scots towards their king, whom  they regarded as their native prince, was naturally much stronger than  that of the English; and would afford him a sure resource, in case of  any rebellion among the latter: that republican principles had long  been, and still were, very prevalent with his southern subjects, and  might again menace the throne with new tumults and resistance: that  the time would probably come, when the king, instead of desiring to see  English garrisons in Scotland, would be better pleased to have Scottish  garrisons in England; who, supported by English pay, would be fond to  curb the seditious genius of that opulent nation: and that a people,  such as the Scots, governed by a few nobility, would more easily be  reduced to submission under monarchy, than one like the English, who  breathed nothing but the spirit of democratical equality.    {1661.} These views induced the king to disband all the forces in  Scotland, and to raze all the forts which had been erected. General  Middleton, created earl of that name, was sent commissioner to the  parliament, which was summoned. A very compliant spirit was there  discovered in all orders of men. The commissioner had even sufficient  influence to obtain an act, annulling at once all laws which had passed  since the year 1633; on pretext of the violence which, during that time,  had been employed against the king and his father, in order to procure  their assent to these statutes. This was a very large, if not an  unexampled concession; and, together with many dangerous limitations,  overthrew some useful barriers which had been erected to the  constitution. But the tide was now running strongly towards monarchy;  and the Scottish nation plainly discovered, that their past resistance  had proceeded more from the turbulence of their aristocracy, and the  bigotry of their ecclesiastics, than from any fixed passion towards  civil liberty. The lords of articles were restored, with some other  branches of prerogative; and royal authority fortified with more  plausible claims and pretences, was, in its full extent, reestablished  in that kingdom.    The prelacy likewise, by the abrogating of every statute enacted  in favor of Presbytery, was thereby tacitly restored; and the king  deliberated what use he should make of this concession. Lauderdale,  who at bottom was a passionate zealot against Episcopacy, endeavored  to persuade him, that the Scots, if gratified in this favorite point  of ecclesiastical government, would, in every other demand, be entirely  compliant with the king. Charles, though he had not so much attachment  to prelacy as had influenced his father and grandfather, had suffered  such indignities from the Scottish Presbyterians, that he ever  after bore them a hearty aversion. He said to Lauderdale, that  Presbyterianism, he thought, was not a religion for a gentleman; and he  could not consent to its further continuance in Scotland. Middleton too  and his other ministers persuaded him, that the nation in general was so  disgusted with the violence and tyranny of the ecclesiastics, that  any alteration of church government would be universally grateful. And  Clarendon, as well as Ormond, dreading that the Presbyterian sect, if  legally established in Scotland, would acquire authority in England and  Ireland, seconded the application of these ministers. The resolution was  therefore taken to restore prelacy; a measure afterwards attended with  many and great inconveniencies: but whether in this resolution Charles  chose not the lesser evil, it is very difficult to determine. Sharp, who  had been commissioned by the Presbyterians in Scotland to manage their  interests with the king, was persuaded to abandon that party; and, as  a reward for his compliance, was created archbishop of St. Andrews. The  conduct of ecclesiastical affairs was chiefly intrusted to him; and as  he was esteemed a traitor and a renegade by his old friends, he became  on that account, as well as from the violence of his conduct, extremely  obnoxious to them.    Charles had not promised to Scotland any such indemnity as he had  insured to England by the declaration of Breda: and it was deemed more  political for him to hold over men's heads, for some time, the terror  of punishment, till they should have made the requisite compliances  with the new government. Though neither the king's temper nor plan of  administration led him to severity, some examples, after such a bloody  and triumphant rebellion, seemed necessary; and the marquis of Argyle  and one Guthry were pitched on as the victims. Two acts of indemnity,  one passed by the late king in 1641, another by the present in 1651,  formed, it was thought, invincible obstacles to the punishment of  Argyle, and barred all inquiry into that part of his conduct which might  justly be regarded as the most exceptionable. Nothing remained but to  try him for his compliance with the usurpation; a crime common to him  with the whole nation, and such a one as the most loyal and affectionate  subject might frequently by violence be obliged to commit. To make this  compliance appear the more voluntary and hearty, there were produced  in court letters which he had written to Albemarle, while that general  commanded in Scotland, and which contained expressions of the most  cordial attachment to the established government. But besides the  general indignation excited by Albemarle's discovery of this private  correspondence, men thought, that even the highest demonstrations of  affection might, during jealous times, be exacted as a necessary mark of  compliance from a person of such distinction as Argyle, and could  not, by any equitable construction, imply the crime of treason. The  parliament, however, scrupled not to pass sentence upon him; and he died  with great constancy and courage. As he was universally known to have  been the chief instrument of the past disorders and civil wars, the  irregularity of his sentence, and several iniquitous circumstances in  the method of conducting his trial, seemed on that account to admit  of some apology. Lord Lorne, son of Argyle, having ever preserved his  loyalty, obtained a gift of the forfeiture. Guthry was a seditious  preacher, and had personally affronted the king: his punishment gave  surprise to nobody. Sir Archibald Johnstone of Warriston was attainted  and fled; but was seized in France about two years after, brought over,  and executed. He had been very active during all the late disorders;  and was even suspected of a secret correspondence with the English  regicides.    Besides these instances of compliance in the Scottish parliament, they  voted an additional revenue to the king of forty thousand pounds a  year, to be levied by way of excise. A small force was purposed to be  maintained by this revenue, in order to prevent like confusions with  those to which the kingdom had been hitherto exposed. An act was also  passed, declaring the covenant unlawful, and its obligation void and  null.    In England, the civil distinctions seemed to be abolished by the lenity  and equality of Charles's administration. Cavalier and roundhead were  heard of no more: all men seemed to concur in submitting to the king's  lawful prerogatives, and in cherishing he just privileges of the people  and of parliament. Theological controversy alone still subsisted, and  kept alive some sparks of that flame which had thrown the nation into  combustion. While Catholics, Independents, and other sectaries were  content with entertaining some prospect of toleration, Prelacy and  Presbytery struggled for the superiority, and the hopes and fears of  both parties kept them in agitation. A conference was held in the  Savoy between twelve bishops and twelve leaders among the Presbyterian  ministers, with an intention, at least on pretence, of bringing about an  accommodation between the parties. The surplice, the cross in baptism,  the kneeling at the sacrament, the bowing at the name of Jesus, were  anew canvassed; and the ignorant multitude were in hopes, that so  many men of gravity and learning could not fail, after deliberate  argumentation, to agree in all points of controversy: they were  surprised to see them separate more inflamed than ever, and more  confirmed in their several prejudices. To enter into particulars would  be superfluous. Disputes concerning religious forms are, in themselves,  the most frivolous of any; and merit attention only so far as they have  influence on the peace and order of civil society.    The king's declaration had promised, that some endeavors should be  used to effect a comprehension of both parties; and Charles's own  indifference with regard to all such questions seemed a favorable  circumstance for the execution of that project. The partisans of a  comprehension said, that the Presbyterians, as well as the Prelatists,  having felt by experience the fatal effects of obstinacy and violence,  were now well disposed towards an amicable agreement: that the bishops,  by relinquishing some part of their authority, and dispensing with the  most exceptionable ceremonies, would so gratify their adversaries as to  obtain their cordial and affectionate compliance, and unite the whole  nation in one faith and one worship: that by obstinately insisting on  forms, in themselves insignificant, an air "]]]
