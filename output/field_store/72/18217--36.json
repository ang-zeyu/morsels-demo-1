But the fact is that a bird's beak is by no  means a perfect eating or food-seizing instrument. A squirrel is far  more dexterous with a nut than a cockatoo; and a dog manages a bone  incomparably better than an eagle. But the beak has to do so much more!  Pruning feathers, building nests, and the incessant discipline in  military arts, are all to be thought of, as much as feeding.    Soldiership, especially, is a much more imperious necessity among birds  than quadrupeds. Neither lions nor wolves habitually use claws or teeth  in contest with their own species; but birds, for their partners, their  nests, their hunting-grounds, and their personal dignity, are nearly  always in contention; their courage is unequaled by that of any other  race of animals capable of comprehending danger; and their pertinacity  and endurance have, in all ages, made them an example to the brave, and  an amusement to the base, among mankind.    22. Nevertheless, since as sword, as trowel, or as pocket-comb, the  beak of the bird has to be pointed, the collection of seeds may be  conveniently intrusted to this otherwise penetrative instrument, and  such food as can only be obtained by probing crevices, splitting open  fissures, or neatly and minutely picking things up, is allotted,  pre-eminently, to the bird species.    The food of the robin, as you know, is very miscellaneous. Linnaeus says  of the Swedish one, that it is \"delectatus euonymi baccis,\"--\"delighted  with dogwood berries,\"--the dogwood growing abundantly in Sweden, as  once in Forfarshire, where it grew, though only a bush usually in the  south, with trunks a foot or eighteen inches in diameter, and the tree  thirty feet high. But the Swedish robin's taste for its berries is to  be noted by you, because, first, the dogwood berry is commonly said to  be so bitter that it is not eaten by birds (Loudon, \"Arboretum,\" ii.,  497, 1.); and, secondly, because it is a pretty coincidence that this  most familiar of household birds should feed fondly from the tree which  gives the housewife her spindle,--the proper name of the dogwood in  English, French, and German being alike \"Spindle-tree.\" It feeds,  however, with us, certainly, most on worms and insects. I am not sure  how far the following account of its mode of dressing its dinners may  be depended on: I take it from an old book on Natural History, but find  it, more or less, confirmed by others: \"It takes a worm by one  extremity in its beak, and beats it on the ground till the inner part  comes away. Then seizing it in a similar manner by the other end, it  entirely cleanses the outer part, which alone it eats.\"    One's first impression is that this must be a singularly unpleasant  operation for the worm, however fastidiously delicate and exemplary in  the robin. But I suppose the real meaning is, that as a worm lives by  passing earth through its body, the robin merely compels it to quit  this--not ill-gotten, indeed, but now quite unnecessary--wealth. We  human creatures, who have lived the lives of worms, collecting dust,  are served by Death in exactly the same manner.    23. You will find that the robin's beak, then, is a very prettily  representative one of general bird power. As a weapon, it is very  formidable indeed; he can kill an adversary of his own kind with one  blow of it in the throat; and is so pugnacious, \"valde pugnax,\" says  Linnaeus, \"ut non una arbor duos capiat erithacos,\"--\"no single tree can  hold two cock-robins;\" and for precision of seizure, the little flat  hook at the end of the upper mandible is one of the most delicately  formed points of forceps which you can find among the grain eaters. But  I pass to one of his more special perfections.    24. He is very notable in the exquisite silence and precision of his  movements, as opposed to birds who either creak in flying, or waddle in  walking. \"Always quiet,\" says Gould, \"for the silkiness of his plumage  renders his movements noiseless, and the rustling of his wings is never  heard, any more than his tread on earth, over which he bounds with  amazing sprightliness.\" You know how much importance I have always  given, among the fine arts, to good dancing. If you think of it, you  will find one of the robin's very chief ingratiatory faculties is his  dainty and delicate movement,--his footing it featly here and there.  Whatever prettiness there may be in his red breast, at his brightest he  can always be outshone by a brickbat. But if he is rationally proud of  anything about him, I should think a robin must be proud of his legs.  Hundreds of birds have longer and more imposing ones--but for real  neatness, finish, and precision of action, commend me to his fine  little ankles, and fine little feet; this long stilted process, as you  know, corresponding to our ankle-bone. Commend me, I say, to the robin  for use of his ankles--he is, of all birds, the pre-eminent and  characteristic Hopper; none other so light, so pert, or so swift.    25. We must not, however, give too much credit to his legs in this  matter. A robin's hop is half a flight; he hops, very essentially, with  wings and tail, as well as with his feet, and the exquisitely rapid  opening and quivering of the tail-feathers certainly give half the  force to his leap. It is in this action that he is put among the  motacillae, or wagtails; but the ornithologists have no real business  to put him among them. The swing of the long tail feathers in the true  wagtail is entirely consequent on its motion, not impulsive of it--the  tremulous shake is _after_ alighting. But the robin leaps with wing,  tail, and foot, all in time, and all helping each other. Leaps, I say;  and you check at the word; and ought to check: you look at a bird  hopping, and the motion is so much a matter of course, you never think  how it is done. But do you think you would find it easy to hop like a  robin if you had two--all but wooden--legs, like this?    26. I have looked wholly in vain through all my books on birds, to find  some account of the muscles it uses in hopping, and of the part of the  toes with which the spring is given. I must leave you to find out that  for yourselves; it is a little bit of anatomy which I think it highly  desirable for you to know, but which it is not my business to teach  you. Only observe, this is the point to be made out. You leap  yourselves, with the toe and ball of the foot; but, in that power of  leaping, you lose the faculty of grasp; on the contrary, with your  hands, you grasp as a bird with its feet. But you cannot hop on your  hands. A cat, a leopard, and a monkey, leap or grasp with equal ease;  but the action of their paws in leaping is, I imagine, from the fleshy  ball of the foot; while in the bird, characteristically [Greek:  gampsonux], this fleshy ball is reduced to a boss or series of bosses,  and the nails are elongated into sickles or horns; nor does the  springing power seem to depend on the development of the bosses. They  are far more developed in an eagle than a robin; but you know how  unpardonably and preposterously awkward an eagle is when he hops. When  they are most of all developed, the bird walks, runs, and digs well,  but leaps badly.    27. I have no time to speak of the various forms of the ankle itself,  or of the scales of armor, more apparent than real, by which the foot  and ankle are protected. The use of this lecture is not either to  describe or to exhibit these varieties to you, but so to awaken your  attention to the real points of character, that, when you have a bird's  foot to draw, you may do so with intelligence and pleasure, knowing  whether you want to express force, grasp, or firm ground pressure, or  dexterity and tact in motion. And as the actions of the foot and the  hand in man are made by every great painter perfectly expressive of the  character of mind, so the expressions of rapacity, cruelty, or force of  seizure, in the harpy, the gryphon, and the hooked and clawed evil  spirits of early religious art, can only be felt by extreme attention  to the original form.    28. And now I return to our main question, for the robin's breast to  answer, \"What is a feather?\" You know something about it already; that  it is composed of a quill, with its lateral filaments terminating  generally, more or less, in a point; that these extremities of the  quills, lying over each other like the tiles of a house, allow the wind  and rain to pass over them with the least possible resistance, and form  a protection alike from the heat and the cold; which, in structure much  resembling the scale-armor assumed by man for very different objects,  is, in fact, intermediate, exactly, between the fur of beasts and the  scales of fishes; having the minute division of the one, and the  armor-like symmetry and succession of the other.    29. Not merely symmetry, observe, but extreme flatness. Feathers are  smoothed down, as a field of corn by wind with rain; only the swathes  laid in beautiful order. They are fur, so structurally placed as to  imply, and submit to, the perpetually swift forward motion. In fact, I  have no doubt the Darwinian theory on the subject is that the feathers  of birds once stuck up all erect, like the bristles of a brush, and  have only been blown flat by continual flying.    Nay, we might even sufficiently represent the general manner of  conclusion in the Darwinian system by the statement that if you fasten  a hair-brush to a mill-wheel, with the handle forward, so as to develop  itself into a neck by moving always in the same direction, and within  continual hearing of a steam-whistle, after a certain number of  revolutions the hair-brush will fall in love with the whistle; they  will marry, lay an egg, and the produce "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21189"],[0,"Aesop, in Rhyme: Old Friends in a New Dress (#4)"],[1,"his head to cast him thence.  \"You rascal, what are you about,\"  Said he, when he had turned him out.  \"I'll teach you soon,\" the lion said,  \"To make a mouse-hole in my head!\"  So saying, he prepared his foot,  To crush the trembling tiny brute;  But he, the mouse, with tearful eye,  Implored the lion's clemency,  Who thought it best at least to give  His little pris'ner a reprieve.  'Twas nearly twelve months after this,  The lion chanced his way to miss;  When pressing forward: heedless yet,  He got entangled in a net.  With dreadful rage he stamp'd and tore,  And straight commenced a lordly roar;  When the poor mouse who heard the noise,  Attended, for she knew his voice.  Then what the lion's utmost strength  Could not effect, she did at length:  With patient labor she applied  Her teeth, the net-work to divide;  And so at last forth issued he,  A _lion_, by a mouse set free.      MORAL.    Few are so small or weak, I guess,  But may assist us in distress;  Nor shall we ever, if we're wise,  The meanest, or the least, despise.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE JEALOUS ASS.      \"There lived,\" says friend Esop, \"some ages ago,  An ass who had feelings acute, you must know;  This ass to be jealous, felt strongly inclined,  And for reasons which follow, felt hurt in his mind.\"    It seems that his master, as I understand,  Had a favorite dog which he fed from his hand.  Nay, the dog was permitted to jump on his knee:  An honor that vex'd our poor donkey to see.    \"Now,\" thought he, \"what's the reason, I cannot see any,  That I have no favors, while he has so many?  If all this is got by just wagging his tail,  Why _I_ have got one, which I'll wag without fail.\"    So the donkey resolved to try what he could do  And, determined unusual attentions to show,  When his master was dining, came into the room.  \"Good sir!\" said his friends, \"why your donkey is come!\"    \"Indeed!\" said their host, great astonishment showing,  When he saw the ass come, while his tail was a-going;  But who can describe his dismay or fear,  When the donkey rear'd up, and bray'd loud in his ear!    \"You rascal get down,--John, Edward, or Dick!  Where are you? make haste, and come here with a stick.\"  The man roared--the guests laugh'd--the dog bark'd--the bell rung:  Coals, poker, and tongs, at the donkey were flung,    Till the blows and the kicks, with combined demonstration,  Convinced him that this was a bad speculation;  So, mortified deeply, his footsteps retrod he,  Hurt much in his mind, but still more in his body.      MORAL.    So some silly children, as stupid as may be,  Will cry for indulgences fit for a baby.  Had they enter'd the room while the donkey withdrew,  They'd have seen their own folly and punishment too:  Let them think of this fable, and what came to pass;  Nor forget, he who play'd this fine game was _an ass_.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE TOWN AND COUNTRY MICE.      A plain, but honest, country mouse,  Residing in a miller's house;  Once, on a time, invited down  An old acquaintance of the town:  And soon he brought his dainties out;  The best he had there's not a doubt.  A dish of oatmeal and green peas,  With half a candle, and some cheese;  Some beans, and if I'm not mistaken,  A charming piece of Yorkshire bacon.  And then to show he was expert  In such affairs, a fine dessert  Was next produced, all which he press'd,  With rustic freedom, on his guest.    But he, the city epicure,  This homely fare could not endure  Indeed he scarcely broke his fast  By what he took, but said, at last,  \"Old crony, now, I'll tell you what:  I don't admire this lonely spot;  This dreadful, dismal, dirty hole,  Seems more adapted for a mole  Than 'tis for you; Oh! could you see  _My_ residence, how charm'd you'd be.  Instead of bringing up your brood  In wind, and wet, and solitude,  Come bring them all at once to town,  We'll make a courtier of a clown.  I think that, for your children's sake,  'Tis proper my advice to take.\"  \"Well,\" said his host, \"I can but try,  And so poor quiet hole good bye!\"    Then off they jogg'd for many a mile,  Talking of splendid things the while;  At last, in town, they all arrived--  Found where the city mouse had lived--  Entered at midnight through a crack,  And rested from their tedious track.    \"Now,\" said the city mouse, \"I'll show  What kind of fare I've brought you to:\"  On which he led the rustic mice  Into a larder, snug and nice,  Where ev'ry thing a mouse could relish,  Did ev'ry shelf and nook embellish.    \"Now is not this to be preferr'd  To your green peas?\" \"Upon my word,  It is,\" the country mouse replied,  \"All this must needs the point decide.\"    Scarce had they spoke these words, when, lo!  A tribe of servants hasten'd through,  And also two gigantic cats,  Who spied our country mouse and brats.  Then, by a timely exit, she  Just saved herself and family.    \"Oh, ask me not,\" said she in haste,  \"Your tempting dainties more to taste;  I much prefer my homely peas,  To splendid dangers such as these.\"      MORAL.    Then let not those begin to grumble,  Whose lot is safe, though poor and humble;  Nor envy him who better fares,  But for each good, has twenty cares.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE FOX AND THE CROW.      Crows feed upon worms: yet an author affirms    Cheshire cheese they will get if they're able;  \"For,\" said he, \"I well know, one unprincipled crow    Once purloined a large piece from my table.\"    Then away darted she, to the shade of a tree,    To deposit the booty within her;  But it never occurr'd to the mind of the bird,    That a _fox_ was to have it for dinner.    \"How many a slip, 'twixt the cup and the lip!\"    (Excuse me, I pray, the digression,)  Said a fox to himself, \"I can share in the pelf,    If I act with my usual discretion.\"    So said he, \"Is it you? pray, ma'am, how do you do,    I have long wish'd to pay you a visit;  For a twelvemonth has pass'd, since I heard of you last    Which is not very neighborly, is it?    \"But, dear madam,\" said he, \"you are dining, I see;    On that subject I'd ask your advice;  Pray, ma'am, now can you tell, where provisions they sell,    That are not an extravagant price?    \"Bread and meat are so dear, and have been for a year,    That poor people can scarcely endure it,  And then _cheese is so high_, that such beggars as I,    _Till it falls_, cannot hope to procure it.\"    But the ill-behaved bird did not utter a word,    Still intent on retaining her plunder;  Thought the fox, \"It should seem, this is not a good scheme,    What else can I think of, I wonder?\"    So said Reynard once more, \"I ne'er knew it before,    But your feathers are whiter than snow is!\"  But thought he, when he'd said it, \"she'll ne'er give it credit,    For what bird is so black as a crow is.\"  \"But I'm told that your voice is a horrible noise,    Which they say of all sounds is the oddest;  But then this is absurd, for it never is heard,    Since you are so excessively modest.\"    If _that's_ all thought the crow, \"I will soon let you know    That all doubt on that score may be ended;\"  Then most laughingly piped, the poor silly biped,    When quickly her dinner descended!      MORAL.    If this _biped_ had not been so vain and conceited,  She would not by the fox quite so soon have been cheated;  But perhaps the term _biped_ to some may be new:  'Tis a two-legged creature--perchance it is _you_.          [Illustration]    THE LION AND THE ECHO.      A lion, bravest of the wood,  Whose title undisputed stood,  As o'er the wide domains he prowl'd,  And in pursuit of booty growl'd,  An Echo from a distant cave  Regrowl'd, articulately grave:  His majesty, surprised, began  To think at first it was a man;  But on reflection sage, he found  It was too like a lion's sound.  \"Whose voice is that which growls at mine?\"  His highness ask'd. Says Echo, \"Mine!\"  \"Thine!\" says the Lion: \"Who art thou?\"  Echo as stern cried, \"Who art thou?\"  \"Know I'm a lion, hear and tremble!\"  Replied the king. Cried Echo, \"Tremble!\"  \"Come forth,\" says Lion; \"show thyself.\"  Laconic Echo answered, \"Elf.\"  \"Elf, durst thou call me, vile pretender?\"  Echo as loud replies, \"Pretender!\"  At this, as jealous of his reign,  He growl'd in rage; she growl'd again.  Incensed the more, he chafed and foam'd,  And round the spacious forest roam'd  To find the rival of his throne,  Who durst with him dispute the crown.    A fox, who listen'd all the while,  Address'd the monarch with a smile:  \"My liege, most humbly I make bold,  Though truth may not be always told,  That this same phantom which you hear,  That so alarms your royal ear,  Is not a rival of your throne:  The voice and fears are all your own.\"  Imaginary terrors scare  A timorous soul with real fear;  Nay, even the wise and brave are cow'd  By apprehensions from the crowd:  A frog a lion may disharm,  And yet how causeless the alarm!    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE PAPER KITE.      Once on a time, a paper kite  Was mounted to a wondrous height;  Where, giddy with its elevation,  It thus express'd self-admiration:  \"See how yon crowds of gazing people  Admire my flight above the steeple;  How would they wonder, if they knew  All that a kite, like me, could do?  Were I but free, I'd take a flight,  And pierce the clouds beyond their sight.  But, ah! like a poor prisoner bound,  My string confines me near the ground.  I'd brave the eagle's towering wing,  Might I but fly without a string.\"  It tugg'd and pull'd, while thus it spoke,  To break the string--at last it broke!  Deprived at once of all its stay,  In vain it tried to soar away:  Unable its own weight to bear,  It flutter'd downward through the air;  Unable its own course to guide,  The winds soon plunged it in the tide.  Oh! foolish kite, thou hadst no wing,  How could'st thou fly without a string?  My heart replied, \"Oh, Lord, I see  How much the kite resembles me!"]]]
