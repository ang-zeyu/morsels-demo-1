Old Jewish houses are crowded all       along near this wall, threatened with destruction at any moment.       The strange circle formed by this wall has an unwelcome, puzzling       appearance.         \"This is the city of the dead--the renowned Prague cemetery.         \"In this abode of rest may be seen the spirit of the nation, whose       bones found shelter here after long wandering,--here is stamped all       its history, full of sufferings, struggles and resistance.         \"It seems as though at any moment these tombs, overgrown with       shrubbery, are ready to open, these stones growing for thousands of       years are ready to raise themselves, and to let out into the world       the restless wanderer with a pack upon his shoulder, with a staff       in his hand, in order to go again to strange peoples,--to cheat and       combat them and to seek a new Canaan--his dominion! The Jewish       cemetery in Prague is the very oldest cemetery known. It was closed       by order of the government a hundred years ago. For foreigners it       is a historical landmark; for the Jews it is a sacred place. The       impression of this deserted spot is intensified by its       surroundings. Amidst the closely crowded tombs and monuments,       overgrown with moss, only a narrow passage remains which is almost       entirely covered with shrubbery of thorn-bushes and mat-weed.         \"During the inspection, the watchman will tell the visitor the       history of the death of Rabbi Ben Manasseh, the great conqueror of       death, and Rabbi Loewe, the most learned Rabbi of the 17th century;       he will speak of Simon the Just and of the Polish princess Anna       Shmiless. He will then lead the visitor to the monument of Anna       Kohn on which can be read the mysterious figure 606, which shows       that the Jews, more than twelve hundred years ago, had buried       their dead here, in the legendary times of Lyubush and her       daughters.         \"If we are not to believe this figure, we must nevertheless agree       with the opinion of the Jews that this is the oldest settlement and       the first Jewish community in Europe.         \"Silently the Jewish guide and the curious foreigner go by one       place where under an old lilac bush a heap of stone stands out, and       when the foreigner asks, 'What is this?' the guide gives an evasive       answer----         \"'Beth Chaim--the house of life.' Thus is the cemetery called. Yes,       indeed, this place of rest is a house of life, for from here is       given the mysterious impulse which makes the exiles masters of the       earth and tyrants of nations,--the impulse which directs the golden       calf to the chosen tribe.         \"The Jewish town has assumed a holiday aspect. The stands of the       petty retailers have disappeared; Jewish boys and girls were       strolling about in their holiday attire. The houses and windows       were adorned with green branches. On the old benches sat men,       talking seriously; in the alleys youths were chatting. From time to       time men and women in their best Sabbath clothes were going to the       synagogue, carrying prayer books in their hands; while poor       Christian women whom need had forced to work in this quarter were       running with keys and dishes in order to prepare for the feast.         \"It was the last day of the Feast of Booths, the day of Assembly,       and dusk was gathering over the narrow streets, while the Christian       part of the city was still brightly illumined by the last rays of       the setting sun. Two men (the older wore a black silk mantle, with       long earlocks, which showed that he was a Polish Jew; the other was       middle aged, in modern clothes, with diamond studs in his shirt and       a heavy golden chain on his vest) walked along the narrow streets,       without paying any attention to the crowd.         \"The younger seemed to be the guide. Having come with his companion       to the little house where the watchman of the cemetery lived, he       knocked at the closed door, through a crevice of which the bright       light of wax candles was seen, showing the watchman's holiday mood.       It was a good summer--a large number of foreigners had visited the       cemetery and were generous in their gifts.         \"In the doorway appeared the thin face of the watchman, whose       short-sighted eyes began to look fixedly into the darkness.         \"'Come out into the street, Joel, somebody wants to talk to you!'         \"'O, God of Justice,' said the watchman with amazement, as he came       out of the door,--'One of the trustees! What is your pleasure to       command me?'         \"'This Rabbi desires to make a brief prayer in the cemetery; he is       leaving to-morrow morning by train.'         \"'In the cemetery? This evening? But you know yourself, Mr. Banker,       that I am forbidden to open the gates after sunset, and to-night is       also the holy Sabbath.'         \"'First of all, there is no need for you to shout here about my       calling,' replied the banker, displeased. 'Every Jewish rag-picker       will know that banker Rosenberg was here to see you. As for the       permit to open the gates, I myself, as a trustee, authorize you to       do it. I will wait here until he has completed his prayer. The       company in your house must not know what we are doing here. Arrange       it so that the curious crowd will not rush in there.'         \"The watchman disappeared in the house, but soon returned with a       bunch of keys and opened the gates of the cemetery. He took a       lantern along and was about to light it.         \"'Don't!' said the Rabbi in a low voice. 'I don't need any light.       Lock the gates from the inside!'         \"'But, Mr. von Rosenberg----'         \"'Lock it, I say!'         \"The watchman obeyed.         \"'Now lead me to the grave of the holy Rabbi Simeon-ben-Yehudah!'         \"'Hold on to my coat, esteemed sir,' said the watchman. 'It is dark       and you may stumble over the old graves.'         \"'I can see better at night than in the daytime, my son!' answered       the learned Polish Jew.         \"'Here is the grave!'         \"The old Rabbi reverently leaned over the tombstone. The watchman       heard him pronounce a prayer in Jewish. He used so many words of       ancient Hebrew, or some other words of a language he did not       understand, that he knew only a few separate expressions, although       he himself had been in the past a teacher at the Bohemian       community.         \"Having completed his prayer, the stranger turned to the watchman       of the cemetery:         \"'When you accepted the position from your predecessor, did he not       give you certain instructions?'         \"'Me?'         \"'Yes, you! It was so from the day the first person was buried in       this place.'         \"'Well, and what if he did give such instructions,--how does that       concern you? This the first time I am asked about this matter since       I am employed here.'         \"'Because this happens once in a hundred years, and human life       rarely lasts as long as that.'         \"'I see that you know about it, Rabbi,' said the frightened       watchman. 'But I can obey you only if you mention the word which       was given to me by my predecessor, because I took a sacred oath on       the Bible.'         \"The Polish Jew bent down and slowly pronounced a word of seven       syllables.         \"The watchman bowed respectfully.         \"'You are the Rabbi!' he said. 'All will be done as you command!'         \"'You will send away the friends who are feasting in your house       before the clock strikes eleven. At the first stroke you will open       the gates of the cemetery, and at the last stroke you will get into       your house, lock the doors and windows, lie down in your bed and       turn into a corpse together with the members of your       household,--into a corpse that sees and hears nothing.'         \"'I will neither look nor listen.'         \"'The angel of death will leave your soul in your body and will       force you to wander about among the graves to the end of time if       you do not carry out my orders correctly. Now go, and remember that       by virtue of your position you are the servant of the great       Jerusalem synagogue. I need not tell you that you should not say       anything to that vain, worldly man who brought me here.'         \"Both returned to the gates, near which the banker was still on       guard.         \"'Well,' he said, 'your desire is fulfilled, Rabbi, and you may       inform my friend in Warsaw that Rosenberg and Son are always ready       to do a favor to a guest recommended by such a personage. Now let       us go home; my wife is waiting for us.'         \"'Let us go, my son,' replied the Rabbi. 'But relieve me of       worldly pleasures. I shall spend the night in prayer!'         \"The banker shrugged his shoulders and gave the watchman a gold       coin.         \"'Joel,' he said in a low voice, 'the other trustees of the       community must not know about this violation of the rule.'         \"The watchman nodded, and the companion again disappeared in the       dark streets, which had already become deserted, while in the       houses people talked merrily and the sounds of holiday festivities       were heard.         \"How poor, dirty and dark these little houses looked from outside!       But it was quite different within! In the rear rooms of many of       these houses the bright light of numerous wax candles was reflected       in the splendid high mirrors, in expensive dishes and precious       rugs. Girls and women, who in the morning perhaps walked with trays       in their hands, now were seated at the tables in heavy silk gowns       with golden chains and bracelets; their jewels and diamonds were       glittering.

He found that their duties  consisted of bearing messages, of hauling any rope to which they  were told to fix themselves, and in receiving, with as good a face  as might be, the various orders, to say nothing of the various  kicks, which might be bestowed upon them by all on board. At the  same time their cheerful countenances showed that these things  which, when told, sounded a little terrible, were in truth in no  way serious.    Ned was first shown where he was to sling his hammock, and how;  where he was to get his food; and under whose orders he was  specially to consider himself; the master, for the present, taking  him under his own charge. For the next ten days, as the vessel  sailed calmly along, with a favoring wind, Ned had learned all the  names of the ropes and sails, and their uses; could climb aloft,  and do his share of the work of the ship; and if not yet a skilled  sailor, was at least on the high road to become one. The master was  pleased at his willingness and eagerness to oblige, and he soon  became a great favorite of his.    Between the four boys on the ship a good feeling existed. All had  been chosen as a special favor, upon the recommendation of one or  other of those in authority. Each of them had made up his mind  that, one of these days, he, too, would command an expedition to  the West Indies. Each thought of the glory which he would attain;  and although, in the hearts of many of the elder men in the  expedition, the substantial benefits to be reaped stood higher than  any ideas of glory or honor; to the lads, at least, pecuniary gain  exercised no inducement whatever. They burned to see the strange  country, and to gain some of the credit and glory which would, if  the voyage was successful, attach to each member of the crew. All  were full of fun, and took what came to them, in the way of work,  so good temperedly and cheerfully, that the men soon ceased to give  them work for work's sake.    They were, too, a strong and well-built group of boys. Ned was by a  full year the youngest, and by nigh a head the shortest of them;  but his broad shoulders and sturdy build, and the strength acquired  by long practice in swimming and rowing, made him their equal.    There were, however, no quarrels among them, and their strength  they agreed to use in alliance, if need be, should any of the crew  make a dead set at one or other of them; for even in an expedition  like this there must be some brutal, as well as many brave men.  There were assuredly two or three, at least, of those on board the  Swanne who might well be called brutal. They were for the most part  old hands, who had lived on board ship half their lives, had taken  part in the slave traffic of Captain Hawkins, and in the  buccaneering exploits of the earlier commanders. To them the voyage  was one in which the lust of gold was the sole stimulant; and,  accustomed to deeds of bloodshed, what feelings they ever had had  become utterly blunted, and they needed but the power to become  despotic and brutal masters.    The chief among these was Giles Taunton, the armorer He was a  swarthy ruffian, who hid, beneath the guise of a jovial bonhomie, a  cruel and unfeeling nature. He was ever ready to cuff and beat the  boys, on the smallest provocation.    They soon gathered together, in a sort of defensive league, against  their common oppressors. All four were high-spirited lads. The  other three, indeed, were sons of men of substance in Devon, whose  fathers had lent funds to Captain Drake for the carrying out of his  great enterprise. They therefore looked but ill on the kicks and  curses which, occasionally, fell to their lot.    One day they gathered together round the bowsprit, and talked over  what they should do. Gerald Summers, the eldest of the party,  proposed that they should go in a body to Captain Drake, and  complain of the tyranny to which they were subject. After some  talk, however, all agreed that such a course as this would lower  them in the estimation of the men, and that it would be better to  put up with the ill treatment than, to get the name of tell tales.    Ned then said to the others:    \"It seems to me that, if we do but hold together, we need not be  afraid of this big bully. If we all declare to each other and swear  that, the first time he strikes one of us, we will all set upon  him; my faith on it, we shall be able to master him, big as he is.  We are all of good size, and in two years will think ourselves men;  therefore it would be shame, indeed, if the four of us could not  master one, however big and sturdy he may be.\"    After much consultation, it was agreed that this course should be  adopted; and the next day, as Reuben Gale was passing by Giles, he  turned round and struck him on the head with a broom. The boy gave  a long whistle, and in a moment, to the astonishment of the  armorer, the other three lads rushed up, and at once assailed him  with fury. Astonished at such an attack, he struck out at them with  many strange oaths. Gerald he knocked down, but Ned leaped on his  back from behind, and the other two, closing with him, rolled him  on to the deck; then, despite of his efforts, they pummeled him  until his face was swollen and bruised, and his eyes nearly closed.    Some of the men of his own sort, standing by, would fain have  interfered; but the better disposed of the crew, who had seen, with  disgust, the conduct of the armorer and his mates to the boys, held  them back, and said that none should come between.    Just as the boys drew off, and allowed the furious armorer to rise  to his feet, Captain John Drake, attracted by the unusual noise,  came from his cabin.    \"What is this?\" he asked.    \"These young wild cats have leapt upon me,\" said Giles Taunton  furiously, \"and have beaten me nigh to death. But I will have my  turn. They will see, and bitterly shall they have cause to regret  what they have done.\"    \"We have been driven almost weary of our lives, sir, with the foul  and rough conduct of this man, and of some of his mates,\" Gerald  said. \"We did not like to come to tell you of it, and to gain the  name of carry tales; but we had resolved among ourselves at last  that, whoever struck one of us, the whole should set upon him.  Today we have carried it out, and we have shown Giles Taunton that  we are more than a match for one man, at any rate.\"    \"Four good-sized dogs, if they are well managed,\" said Captain John  Drake, \"will pull down a lion; and the best thing that the lion can  do is to leave them alone.    \"I am sorry to hear, Master Taunton, that you have chosen to  mistreat these lads; who are, indeed, the sons of worthy men, and  are not the common kind of ship boys. I am sure that my brother  would not brook such conduct, and I warn you that, if any complaint  again on this head reaches me, I shall lay it before him.\"    With angry mutterings, the armorer went below.    \"We have earned a bitter foe,\" Ned said to his friends, \"and we had  best keep our eyes well open. There is very little of the lion  about Master Taunton. He is strong, indeed; but if it be true that  the lion has a noble heart, and fights his foes openly, methinks he  resembles rather the tiger, who is prone to leap suddenly upon his  enemies.\"    \"Yes, indeed, he looked dark enough,\" Gerald said, \"as he went  below; and if looks could have killed us, we should not be standing  here alive, at present.\"    \"It is not force that we need fear now, but that he will do us some  foul turn; at all events, we are now forewarned, and if he plays us  a scurvy trick it will be our own faults.\"    For several days the voyage went on quietly, and without adventure.  They passed at a distance the Portuguese Isle of Madeira, lying  like a cloud on the sea. The weather now had become warm and very  fair, a steady wind blew, and the two barks kept along at a good  pace.    All sorts of creatures, strange to the boys, were to be seen in the  sea. Sometimes there was a spout of a distant whale. Thousands of  flying fish darted from the water, driven thence by the pursuit of  their enemies beneath; while huge flocks of gulls and other birds  hovered over the sea, chasing the flying fish, or pouncing down  upon the shoals of small fry; whose splashings whitened the surface  of the water, as if a sandbank had laid below it.    Gradually, as the time went on, the heat increased. Many of the  crew found themselves unable to sleep below, for in those days  there was but little thought of ventilation. The boys were among  these, for the heat and the confinement were, to them, especially  irksome.    One day the wind had fallen almost to a calm, and the small boat  had been lowered, to enable the carpenter to do some repair to the  ship's side, where a seam leaked somewhat, when the waves were  high. When night came on, and all was quiet, Ned proposed to the  others that they should slip down the rope over the stern into the  boat which was towing behind; where they could sleep undisturbed by  the tramp of the sentry, or the call to pull at ropes and trim  sails.    The idea was considered a capital one, and the boys slid down into  the boat; where, taking up their quarters as comfortably as they  could, they, after a short chat, curled themselves up and were soon  sound asleep, intending to be on board again, with the earliest  gleam of morn.    When they awoke, however, it was with a start and a cry. The sun  was already high, but there were no signs whatever of the ship;  they floated, alone, in the mid-ocean. With blank amazement they  looked at each other.    \"This is a stroke of misfortune, indeed,\" Gerald said. \"We have  lost the ship, and I fear our lives, as well.    \"What do you say, Otter?\"    For the lad's nickname had come on board ship with him, and he was"]]]
