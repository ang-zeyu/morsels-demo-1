By rapid and energetic movement, while the  opponent's forces are still separated, every advantage must be seized  to destroy hostile detachments within reach, and to establish one's  own front as far in advance of the great national interests, as it can  be reasonably hoped to maintain it with communications unbroken. The  line thus occupied must rest upon positions so chosen that by their  strength, natural and developed, it shall be possible, when offence  has to be exchanged for defensive warfare, to impose to the utmost  upon the invader both delay and loss; for delay and loss mean  lessening power, and only by causing such diminution, greater  relatively than his own, can the weaker hope eventually to reverse the  odds and win the game.    To this end, therefore, the Boers with sound military judgment at once  devoted themselves; and it is very likely that the surmise before  quoted was correct--in naming the Hex River Pass and Durban as their  ultimate objectives, to be reached by a swift advance. The latter was  certainly not an unreasonable hope, and it is possible that with  {p.027} more precise accuracy of combination, and an offensive more  resolutely sustained, they might have attained their purpose, through  the mistaken primary dispositions of the British, who, though  recognizing themselves to be for the time on the defensive,  nevertheless, for political reasons, advanced their front of  operations to a point with which, as it proved, they could not secure  their communications. From the worst consequences of this error they  were saved by the gallantry and skill with which advantage was taken  of the defective co-operation that marked the opening of the campaign  by the Boers; and there can be also little question that the wholesome  respect for their fighting qualities, thus established at the  beginning of hostilities, had a most beneficial effect for them, in  discouraging attack by an enemy, who, though brave and active,  constitutionally prefers a waiting game to an assault. Thus the  ultimate fate of Ladysmith was settled in the fortnight of operations  that preceded the investment.          CHAPTER II {p.028}    THE OPENING CAMPAIGN IN NATAL TO THE INVESTMENT OF LADYSMITH  (OCTOBER 11-NOVEMBER 2)      The evident exposure of Natal to the first and heaviest attack of the  enemy, and the necessity so to provide for its defence as to gain the  time necessary for reinforcements to arrive, engaged very early the  anxious attention of the Imperial and local authorities. The latter  especially felt the greater solicitude, which is natural to those  whose interests are immediately threatened. As early as May 25, before  the Bloemfontein Conference between Sir Alfred Milner and President  Kruger, the Natal Ministry notified Mr. Chamberlain that, owing to  Boer preparations across the border, the scattered British in the neck  of Natal were getting uneasy, and the Ministry itself nervous, at the  prospect of war. These representations were {p.029} repeated more  urgently in the middle of June, and a month later a request was made  to be confidentially informed of the proposed plan for defence. When  this was communicated, it appeared that General Sir Penn Symons,  commanding the Imperial troops in Natal (who afterward was the first  general officer killed in the war), considered that with the force  then at his disposal--something over 5,000 men of all arms--he could  do no more than hold the railroad as far as Hattingh Spruit, some five  miles north of Dundee, thereby protecting the collieries. To advance  as far as Newcastle he estimated would require 2,000 more, while to  hold Laing's Nek an addition of 5,600 would be needed.    These calculations, as is now known, fell far short of the necessities  of the case, but they sufficiently alarmed the Colonial Government,  and upon its remonstrance the British Cabinet, on August 3, decided to  send a reinforcement of 2,000 men.    On the 6th of September the Governor of Natal telegraphed at length to  London many menacing symptoms observable among the Boers, {p.030}  from which war was believed to be inevitable, and urged the immediate  despatch of troops sufficient to protect the colony. In response to  this, orders were issued on September 8 for 5,700 men to start from  India, and a small additional force from England itself, making a  total of from seven to eight thousand. These were expected to arrive,  and actually did for the most part arrive, between October 12 and 19,  but even so were barely in time for the critical moment. They were  also only sufficient imperfectly to defend the colony, and were by no  means adequate to the offensive purpose which the Boer Government, in  its ultimatum, professed to discern.    Meanwhile, on the 25th of September, Glencoe had been occupied by a  detachment from Ladysmith, while reinforcements were sent to the  latter. It had by this time been recognized that the attempt to hold  the more advanced positions, such as Newcastle and Laing's Nek, would  expose the forces so placed to the fate of isolation which afterward  befell Ladysmith. The course of both the Imperial and colonial  governments at this period {p.031} was much affected by a wish not to  precipitate hostile action on the part of the Boers; for, in general,  war was not desired by the British, and, in particular, they were as  yet unready. On the 28th, however, such definite and threatening  movements were reported that the Natal Ministry decided at all hazards  to call out the volunteers, although it had apprehended that this step  would be considered practically equivalent to a declaration of war.    The increase of force in Natal to 15,000 men determined the sending  out of an officer superior in rank to General Symons. Sir George  White, designated for this duty, reached Cape Town October 3, and in  view of the serious news he there received, proceeded at once to  Durban. On the 9th, the day the Boer ultimatum was issued, he had at  Pietermaritzburg an interview with the Governor, in which he expressed  his disapproval of the position at Glencoe--an opinion in which other  officers of rank present coincided. The Governor replied that General  Symons had thought it safe, even before the Indian contingent arrived;  that the step had been {p.032} taken to assure the coal supply; and  that to recede from it now would involve grave political consequences,  disheartening the loyal, and tending to encourage a rising among the  blacks and the disaffected Dutch. Without changing his opinion as to  the military error involved, Sir George White resolved to allow the  detachment to remain. The decision thus taken finally constituted the  British military situation in Natal when the campaign opened; namely,  an advanced detachment of three or four thousand at Glencoe and  Dundee, a main body of eight to ten thousand at Ladysmith, with  smaller posts guarding the communications in rear of the latter.    The greater exposure of Natal, owing to its nearness to the Boer  States, had determined the concentration upon it of the bulk of the  British forces in South Africa, including the reinforcements so far  ordered; by the arrival of which it was expected that there would by  the end of October be 22,000 troops in South Africa. It was not till  October 7 that was issued the first order to mobilise, summoning  25,000 of the Army Reserve to join the colours.    The {p.033} necessities of Natal left but scant numbers to Cape  Colony, which was comparatively of less consequence, because the  points of vital importance to Great Britain lay near the sea-coast,  protected by their mere remoteness from any speedy attack. On the far  inland borders of the colony the situation soon reduced itself to that  with which we were so long familiar. The four or five thousand men  available at the outbreak of the war for the defence of the long  frontier, extending over five hundred miles, from the Basutoland  boundary to Mafeking, were obliged by the necessities of the case to  concentrate; which they did at Mafeking and Kimberley. There they were  speedily invested; and, being thus held in check, the border country,  including the important railroad junctions of De Aar, Naauwport and  Stormberg, lay freely open to the enemy. The seriousness of this  military condition was much increased by the well-known political fact  that the Dutch population of the region sympathized more or less  actively with the Boers. In fact many of them, upon the opening of  hostilities, crossed the border {p.034} to join the forces of the  Orange Free State.    On the 9th of October, 1899, the Transvaal Government presented an  ultimatum. After recounting the political grievances of which it  complained, it demanded that all points of mutual difference should be  settled by arbitration, or other peaceful means, that the British  troops near the Transvaal border should be withdrawn, that the recent  reinforcements be removed altogether from South Africa, and that those  still on the sea should not be landed. If a satisfactory answer were  not received by 5 P.M., October 11, the action of the British  Government would be regarded as a formal declaration of war. War  therefore may be considered as having been formally initiated by the  Transvaal, at the day and hour thus fixed.    For some time prior to the opening of hostilities, the armed men of  both the South African Republic and the Free State had been assembling  in force on their respective frontiers toward Natal; the latter less  rapidly than the former, its military preparation not having received  as full development as that of its ally, {p.035} who for some years  had been contemplating the possibility of war and accumulating  material. The Transvaalers came in rapidly, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#4)"],[1,"and gold and the scarlet  robes. Before him sat King Sigismund on the throne. The two men looked  each other in the face. As the articles were rapidly read out against  him, John Hus endeavoured to speak in his own defence. He was told to  hold his tongue. Let him answer the charges all at once at the close.    \"How can I do that,\" said Hus, \"when I cannot even bear them all in  mind?\"    He made another attempt.    \"Hold your tongue,\" said Cardinal Zabarella; \"we have already given you  a sufficient hearing.\"    With clasped hands, and in ringing tones, Hus begged in vain for a  hearing. Again he was told to hold his peace, and silently he raised  his eyes to heaven in prayer. He was accused of denying the Catholic  doctrine of transubstantiation. He sprang to his feet in anger.  Zabarella tried to shout him down. The voice of Hus rang out above the  babel.    \"I have never held, taught or preached,\" he cried, \"that in the  sacrament of the altar material bread remains after consecration.\"    The trial was short and sharp. The verdict had been given beforehand.  He was now accused of another horrible crime. He had actually described  himself as the fourth person in the Godhead! The charge was monstrous.    \"Let that doctor be named,\" said Hus, \"who has given this evidence  against me.\"    But the name of his false accuser was never given. He was now accused  of a still more dangerous error. He had appealed to God instead of  appealing to the Church.    \"O Lord God,\" he exclaimed, \"this Council now condemns Thy action and  law as an error! I affirm that there is no safer appeal than that to the  Lord Jesus Christ.\"    With those brave words he signed his own death warrant. For all his  orthodoxy on certain points, he made it clearer now than ever that  he set the authority of his own conscience above the authority of the  Council; and, therefore, according to the standard of the day, he had to  be treated as a heretic.    \"Moreover,\" he said, with his eye on the King, \"I came here freely to  this Council, with a safe-conduct from my Lord the King here present,  with the desire to prove my innocence and to explain my beliefs.\"    At those words, said the story in later years, King Sigismund blushed.  If he did, the blush is the most famous in the annals of history; if he  did not, some think he ought to have done. For Hus the last ordeal had  now arrived; and the Bishop of Concordia, in solemn tones, read out the  dreadful articles of condemnation. For heretics the Church had then but  little mercy. His books were all to be burned; his priestly office must  be taken from him; and he himself, expelled from the Church, must be  handed over to the civil power. In vain, with a last appeal for justice,  he protested that he had never been obstinate in error. In vain he  contended that his proud accusers had not even taken the trouble to read  some of his books. As the sentence against himself was read, and the  vision of death rose up before him, he fell once more on his knees and  prayed, not for himself, but for his enemies.    \"Lord Jesus Christ,\" he said, \"pardon all my enemies, I pray thee, for  the sake of Thy great mercy! Thou knowest that they have falsely accused  me, brought forward false witnesses and false articles against me. O!  pardon them for Thine infinite mercies' sake.\"    At this beautiful prayer the priests and bishops jeered. He was ordered  now to mount the scaffold, to put on the priestly garments, and to  recant his heretical opinions. The first two commands he obeyed; the  third he treated with scorn. As he drew the alb over his shoulders, he  appealed once more to Christ.    \"My Lord Jesus Christ,\" he said, \"was mocked in a white robe, when led  from Herod to Pilate.\"    There on the scaffold he stood, with his long white robe upon him and  the Communion Cup in his hand; and there, in immortal burning words, he  refused to recant a single word that he had written.    \"Behold,\" he cried, \"these Bishops demand that I recant and abjure. I  dare not do it. If I did, I should be false to God, and sin against my  conscience and Divine truth.\"    The Bishops were furious. They swarmed around him. They snatched the Cup  from his hand.    \"Thou cursed Judas!\" they roared. \"Thou hast forsaken the council of  peace. Thou hast become one of the Jews. We take from thee this Cup of  Salvation.\"    \"But I trust,\" replied Hus, \"in God Almighty, and shall drink this Cup  this day in His Kingdom.\"    The ceremony of degradation now took place. As soon as his robes had  been taken from him, the Bishops began a hot discussion about the proper  way of cutting his hair. Some clamoured for a razor, others were all for  scissors.    \"See,\" said Hus to the King, \"these Bishops cannot agree in their  blasphemy.\"    At last the scissors won the victory. His tonsure was cut in four  directions, and a fool's cap, a yard high, with a picture of devils  tearing his soul, was placed upon that hero's head.    \"So,\" said the Bishops, \"we deliver your soul to the devil.\"    \"Most joyfully,\" said Hus, \"will I wear this crown of shame for thy  sake, O Jesus! who for me didst wear a crown of thorns.\"    \"Go, take him,\" said the King. And Hus was led to his death. As he  passed along he saw the bonfire in which his books were being burned. He  smiled. Along the streets of the city he strode, with fetters clanking  on his feet, a thousand soldiers for his escort, and crowds of admirers  surging on every hand. Full soon the fatal spot was reached. It was a  quiet meadow among the gardens, outside the city gates. At the stake he  knelt once more in prayer, and the fool's cap fell from his head. Again  he smiled. It ought to be burned along with him, said a watcher, that he  and the devils might be together. He was bound to the stake with seven  moist thongs and an old rusty chain, and faggots of wood and straw were  piled round him to the chin. For the last time the Marshal approached to  give him a fair chance of abjuring.    \"What errors,\" he retorted, \"shall I renounce? I know myself guilty of  none. I call God to witness that all that I have written and preached  has been with the view of rescuing souls from sin and perdition, and  therefore most joyfully will I confirm with my blood the truth I have  written and preached.\"    As the flame arose and the wood crackled, he chanted the Catholic burial  prayer, \"Jesu, Son of David, have mercy upon me.\" From the west a gentle  breeze was blowing, and a gust dashed the smoke and sparks in his face.  At the words \"Who was born of the Virgin Mary\" he ceased; his lips moved  faintly in silent prayer; and a few moments later the martyr breathed  no more. At last the cruel fire died down, and the soldiers wrenched his  remains from the post, hacked his skull in pieces, and ground his bones  to powder. As they prodded about among the glowing embers to see how  much of Hus was left, they found, to their surprise, that his heart was  still unburned. One fixed it on the point of his spear, thrust it  back into the fire, and watched it frizzle away; and finally, by the  Marshal's orders, they gathered all the ashes together, and tossed them  into the Rhine.    He had died, says a Catholic writer, for the noblest of all causes. He  had died for the faith which he believed to be true.          CHAPTER III. -- THE WELTER, 1415-1434.    The excitement in Bohemia was intense. As the ashes of Hus floated down  the Rhine, the news of his death spread over the civilized world, and in  every Bohemian town and hamlet the people felt that their greatest man  had been unjustly murdered. He had become the national hero and the  national saint, and now the people swore to avenge his death. A Hussite  League was formed by his followers, a Catholic League was formed by his  enemies. The Hussite Wars began. It is important to note with exactness  what took place. As we study the history of men and nations, we are apt  to fancy that the rank and file of a country can easily be united in  one by common adherence to a common cause. It is not so. For one man who  will steadily follow a principle, there are hundreds who would rather  follow a leader. As long as Hus was alive in the flesh, he was able to  command the loyalty of the people; but now that his tongue was silent  for ever, his followers split into many contending factions. For all his  eloquence he had never been able to strike one clear commanding note. In  some of his views he was a Catholic, in others a Protestant. To some he  was merely the fiery patriot, to others the champion of Church Reform,  to others the high-souled moral teacher, to others the enemy of the  Pope. If the people had only been united they might now have gained  their long-lost freedom. But unity was the very quality they lacked the  most. They had no clear notion of what they wanted; they had no definite  scheme of church reform; they had no great leader to show them the way  through the jungle, and thus, instead of closing their ranks against the  common foe, they split up into jangling sects and parties, and made the  confusion worse confounded.    First in rank and first in power came the Utraquists or Calixtines.[2] For  some reason these men laid all the stress on a doctrine taught by Hus in  his later years. As he lay in his gloomy dungeon near Constance, he had  written letters contending that laymen should be permitted to take the  wine at the Communion. For this doctrine the Utraquists now fought  tooth and nail. They emblazoned the Cup on their banners. They were the  aristocrats of the movement; they were led by the University dons; they  were political rather than religious in their aims; they regarded Hus  as a patriot; and, on the whole, they did not care much for moral and  spiritual reforms.    Next came the Taborites, the red-hot Radicals, with Socialist ideas of  property and loose ideals of morals. They built themselves a fort on  Mount Tabor, and held"]]]
