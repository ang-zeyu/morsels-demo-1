Subsequent experience has only served to confirm this opinion.    The past has produced many good speakers, among them Henry Clay,  Daniel Webster, Edwin Booth, Wm. Charles Macready, and Edward Everett.  Of the last Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote: \"It is with delight that one  who remembers Edward Everett in his robes of rhetorical splendor,  recalls his full blown, high colored, double flowered periods; the  rich, resonant, grave, far-reaching music of his speech, with just  enough of the nasal vibration to give the vocal sounding-board its  proper value in the harmonies of utterance.\" These examples of correct  vocalization, however, were exceptions to the general rule; they  happened to speak well, but the physiologic action of the vocal organs  which produced such results in those individual cases was not  understood, and hence the pupil ambitious to imitate them and develop  the best of which his voice was capable had no rule by which to  proceed. Few could speak with ease, still fewer could be heard by a  large assembly, and sore throats seemed to be the rule.      DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SINGING AND SPEAKING    In singing the flow of tone is unbroken between the words, but in  speaking it is interrupted. In singing tone is sustained and changed  from one pitch to another by definite intervals over a wide compass  that includes notes not attempted in speech. In speaking tone is  unsustained, not defined in pitch, is limited to a narrow compass, and  the length of the tones is not governed by the measure of music.    Notwithstanding these differences, singing and speaking tones are  produced by the vocal organs in the same way, are focused precisely  alike, have the same resonance, and are delivered in the same manner.  It has been said that speech differs from song as walking from  dancing. Speech may be called the prose, and song the poetry of  vocalization.    During the past decade the knowledge of the speaking voice has been  greatly broadened, and the art of cultivating tone has made progress.  The identity of the singing and speaking voice is becoming more fully  recognized, and methods are being used to develop the latter similar  to those in use for the training of the former. As Dr. Morell  Mackenzie says: \"Singing is a help to good speaking, as the greater  includes the less.\"    The recognition of this truth cannot fail to be a great aid to the  progress of singing in the public schools, since every enlargement of  exercises common to both speaking and singing helps to solidarity and  _esprit de corps_ in teaching and in learning.    An accurate sense of pitch, melody, harmony, and rhythm is necessary  to the singer, but the orator may, by cultivation, develop a speaking  voice of musical quality without being able to distinguish _Old  Hundred_ from _The Last Rose of Summer_.      PRONUNCIATION    It is a matter of common observation that American singers, although  they may be painstaking in their French and German, are indifferent,  even to carelessness, in the clear and finished enunciation of their  native tongue. Mr. W.J. Henderson, in his recent work, _The Art of the  Singer_, says: \"The typical American singer cannot sing his own  language so that an audience can understand him; nine-tenths of the  songs we hear are songs without words.\" Happily this condition is  gradually yielding to a better one, stimulated in part by the examples  of visiting singers and actors. In story-telling songs and in  oratorio, slovenly delivery is reprehensible, but when the words of a  song are the lyric flight of a true poet, a careless utterance becomes  intolerable.    Beauty of tone is not everything; the singing of mere sounds, however  lovely, is but a tickling of the ear. The shortcoming of the Italian  school of singing, as of composition, has been too exclusive devotion  to sensuous beauty of tone as an end in itself. The singer must never  forget that his mission is to =vitalize text with tone=. The songs of  Schubert, Schumann, Franz, Brahms, Grieg, Strauss, and Wolf, as well  as the Wagnerian drama, are significant in their inseparable union of  text and music. The singer is therefore an interpreter, not of music  alone, but of text made potent by music.    Pronunciation, moreover, concerns not only the listener, but the  singer and speaker, for pure tone and pure pronunciation cannot be  divorced, one cannot exist without the other. In his interesting work,  _The Singing of the Future_, Mr. Ffrangcon-Davies insists that, \"the  quickest way to fine tone is through fine pronunciation.\"    We cannot think except in words, nor voice our thought without speech.  Vocal utterance is thought articulate. Therefore, instead of prolonged  attention to tone itself, training should be concentrated upon the  uttered word. The student should aim \"to sing a word rather than a  tone.\" Correct pronunciation and beautiful tone are so interdependent  as to be inseparable.    The singer and speaker require all sounds in their purity. To seek to  develop the voice along the narrow limits of any single vowel or  syllable, as for instance the syllable _ah_, is harmful. Not only is  this vowel sound, as Lilli Lehmann says, \"the most difficult,\" but the  proper pronunciation of all words within the whole range of the voice  is thereby impeded. Diction and tone work should therefore go hand in  hand. \"The way in which vowel melts into vowel and consonants float  into their places largely determines the character of the tone  itself.\" Without finished pronunciation speech and song of emotional  power are impossible. Gounod, the composer, says, \"Pronunciation  creates eloquence.\" Mr. Forbes-Robertson, the English master of  dramatic diction, speaking for his own profession says: \"The trouble  with contemporary stage elocution springs from the actor's very desire  to act well. In his effort to be natural he mumbles his words as too  many people do in everyday life. Much of this can be corrected by  constantly bearing in mind the true value of vowels, the percussive  value of consonants, and the importance of keeping up the voice until  the last word is spoken. There must be, so to speak, plenty of wind in  the bellows. The great thing is to have the sound come from the front  of the mouth.... The actor must learn to breathe deeply from the  diaphragm and to take his breath at the proper time. Too often the  last word is not held up, and that is very often the important  word.... Schools for acting are valuable, ... but, after all, the  actors, like other folk, must be taught how to speak as children in  the home, at school, and in society.\"    In pronunciation the words should seem to be formed by the upper lip  and to come out through it. By this method it will be found easy to  pronounce distinctly. The words will thus be formed outside the mouth  and be readily heard, as is a person talking in front of, instead of  behind, a screen. A single, intelligent trial will be sufficient to  show the correctness of the statement. Thinking of the upper lip as  the fashioner of the words makes speaking easy and singing a delight.    To smile while talking gives to the words a flat, silly sound, hence  the corners of the mouth should be kept well forward.      THE SINGER'S SCALE OF VOWEL SOUNDS    [Illustration:    1  n_ee_  2  n_i_t  3  n_e_t  4  n_a_y  5  n_ai_r  6  n_a_t  7  n_i_gh  8  N_a_h  7' n_o_t  6' n_a_w  5' n_e_r  4' n_u_t  3' n_o_  2' n_oo_k  1' n_oo_.]    It may fasten this in mind to remember that at one end of the vowel  scale is--_me_, at the other--_you_.    The teeth and lips are most closed at the extremes of this scale, and  gradually open toward _ah_, with which vowel they are widest apart.    In the series 1-8 the tongue is highest in the centre for _ee_ and  gradually descends until it lies flat in the mouth for _ah_.    The _upper_ pharynx is most closed in 1, most open in 8, and closes  more and more in the descending series 7'-1'.    The _lower_ pharynx gradually opens in the descending series 7'-1'.    The researches of Helmholtz, Koenig, Willis, Wheatstone, Appunn, Bell,  and others have shown that each vowel sound has its own characteristic  pitch. The Scale of Vowel Sounds given above corresponds closely to  the order of resonance pitch from the highest _ee_ to the lowest _oo_.  In the natural resonance of the vowels _ee_ is highest in the head,  _ah_ is midway in the scale, and _oo_ is lowest in resonance.      LIP POSITION    Figure 2 shows the best position of the lips to give the sound of  _ee_. Hold the under jaw without stiffness and as far from the upper  teeth as is consistent with delivery of the pure sound of this vowel.    Figure 3 shows the best position of the lips to produce the vowel  _oo_.    Figure 4 shows the position of the lips for the vowel sound of long  _o_. The opening of the lips should be made as round as is the letter  _o_. When preparing the lips to give the sound of _o_, the inclination  is strong to drop the lower jaw; in practice, to develop action of the  lips, the under jaw would better be held quite immovable. It will be  found possible to produce all of the vowel sounds without any change  except in the form of the opening of the lips. The vowel sound of _i_  is an exception; for as a compound of _ah_ and _ee_, the extremes of  the vowel scale, it requires two distinct positions for its utterance  with a movement of transition between; it is not, therefore, a good  vowel for initial practice.    [Illustration: FIGURE 2.]    [Illustration: FIGURE 3.]    [Illustration: FIGURE 4.]    [Illustration: FIGURE 5.]    Figure 5 shows that the sound _aw_ is produced from _o_ by raising the  edge of the upper lip outward and upward, and flattening the raised  portion laterally.    Figure 6 shows the position for producing _ah_. It differs from the  position assumed for _aw_ in that the opening of the lips is larger,  the upper lip is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19142"],[0,"The Devil Doctor (#4)"],[1,"Karamaneh ... Karamaneh  whom once we had rescued from the house of this fiendish Chinese  doctor; Karamaneh who had been our ally, in fruitless quest of  whom,--when, too late, I realized how empty my life was become--I had  wasted what little of the world's goods I possessed:--Karamaneh!    \"Poor old Petrie,\" murmured Smith. \"I knew, but I hadn't the  heart--_He_ has her again--God knows by what chains he holds her. But  she's only a woman, old boy, and women are very much alike--very much  alike from Charing Cross to Pagoda Road.\"    He rested his hand on my shoulder for a moment; I am ashamed to  confess that I was trembling; then, clenching my teeth with that  mechanical physical effort which often accompanies a mental one, I  swallowed the bitter draught of Nayland Smith's philosophy. He was  raising himself, to peer, cautiously, over the top of the door. I did  likewise.    The window from which the girl had looked was nearly on a level with  our eyes, and as I raised my head above the woodwork, I quite  distinctly saw her go out of the room. The door, as she opened it,  admitted a dull light, against which her figure showed silhouetted for  a moment. Then the door was reclosed.    \"We must risk the other windows,\" rapped Smith.    Before I had grasped the nature of his plan, he was over and had  dropped almost noiselessly upon the casks outside. Again I followed  his lead.    \"You are not going to attempt anything, single-handed--against _him_?\"  I asked.    \"Petrie--Eltham is in that house. He has been brought here to be put  to the question, in the mediaeval, and Chinese, sense! Is there time to  summon assistance?\"    I shuddered. This had been in my mind, certainly, but so expressed it  was definitely horrible--revolting, yet stimulating.    \"You have the pistol,\" added Smith; \"follow closely, and quietly.\"    He walked across the tops of the casks and leapt down, pointing to  that nearest to the closed door of the house. I helped him place it  under the open window. A second we set beside it, and, not without  some noise, got a third on top.    Smith mounted.    His jaw muscles were very prominent and his eyes shone like steel; but  he was as cool as though he were about to enter a theatre and not the  den of the most stupendous genius who ever worked for evil. I would  forgive any man who, knowing Dr. Fu-Manchu, feared him; I feared him  myself--feared him as one fears a scorpion; but when Nayland Smith  hauled himself up on to the wooden ledge above the door and swung  thence into the darkened room, I followed and was in close upon his  heels. But I admired him, for he had every ampere of his  self-possession in hand; my own case was different.    He spoke close to my ear.    \"Is your hand steady? We may have to shoot.\"    I thought of Karamaneh, of lovely dark-eyed Karamaneh, whom this  wonderful, evil product of secret China had stolen from me--for so I  now adjudged it.    \"Rely upon me!\" I said grimly. \"I--\"    The words ceased--frozen on my tongue.    There are things that one seeks to forget, but it is my lot often to  remember the sound which at that moment literally struck me rigid with  horror. Yet it was only a groan; but, merciful God! I pray that it may  never be my lot to listen to such a groan again.    Smith drew a sibilant breath.    \"It's Eltham!\" he whispered hoarsely, \"they're torturing--\"    \"No, no!\" screamed a woman's voice--a voice that thrilled me anew,  but with another emotion. \"Not that, not--\"    I distinctly heard the sound of a blow. Followed a sort of vague  scuffling. A door somewhere at the back of the house opened--and shut  again. Some one was coming along the passage towards us!    \"Stand back!\" Smith's voice was low, but perfectly steady. \"Leave it  to me!\"    Nearer came the footsteps and nearer. I could hear suppressed sobs.  The door opened, admitting again the faint light--and Karamaneh came  in. The place was quite unfurnished, offering no possibility of  hiding; but to hide was unnecessary.    Her slim figure had not crossed the threshold ere Smith had his arm  about the girl's waist and one hand clapped to her mouth. A stifled  gasp she uttered, and he lifted her into the room.    \"Shut the door, Petrie,\" he directed.    I stepped forward and closed the door. A faint perfume stole to my  nostrils--a vague, elusive breath of the East, reminiscent of strange  days that, now, seemed to belong to a remote past. Karamaneh! that  faint, indefinable perfume was part of her dainty personality; it may  appear absurd--impossible--but many and many a time I had dreamt of  it.    \"In my breast pocket,\" rapped Smith; \"the light.\"    I bent over the girl as he held her. She was quite still, but I could  have wished that I had had more certain mastery of myself. I took the  torch from Smith's pocket and, mechanically, directed it upon the  captive.    She was dressed very plainly, wearing a simple blue skirt, and white  blouse. It was easy to divine that it was she whom Eltham had mistaken  for a French maid. A brooch set with a ruby was pinned at the point  where the blouse opened--gleaming fierily and harshly against the soft  skin. Her face was pale and her eyes wide with fear.    \"There is some cord in my right-hand pocket,\" said Smith. \"I came  provided. Tie her wrists.\"    I obeyed him, silently. The girl offered no resistance, but I think I  never essayed a less congenial task than that of binding her white  wrists. The jewelled fingers lay quite listlessly in my own.    \"Make a good job of it!\" rapped Smith significantly.    A flush rose to my cheeks, for I knew well enough what he meant.    \"She is fastened,\" I said, and I turned the ray of the torch upon her  again.    Smith removed his hand from her mouth but did not relax his grip of  her. She looked up at me with eyes in which I could have sworn there  was no recognition. But a flush momentarily swept over her face, and  left it pale again.    \"We shall have to--gag her--\"    \"Smith, I can't do it!\"    The girl's eyes filled with tears and she looked up at my companion  pitifully.    \"Please don't be cruel to me,\" she whispered, with that soft accent  which always played havoc with my composure. \"Every one--every one--is  cruel to me. I will promise--indeed I will swear, to be quiet. Oh,  believe me, if you can save him I will do nothing to hinder you.\" Her  beautiful head drooped. \"Have some pity for me as well.\"    \"Karamaneh,\" I said, \"we would have believed you once. We cannot now.\"    She started violently.    \"You know my name!\" Her voice was barely audible. \"Yet I have never  seen you in my life--\"    \"See if the door locks,\" interrupted Smith harshly.    Dazed by the apparent sincerity in the voice of our lovely  captive--vacant from wonder of it all--I opened the door, felt for,  and found, a key.    We left Karamaneh crouching against the wall; her great eyes were  turned towards me fascinatedly. Smith locked the door with much care.  We began a tip-toed progress along the dimly-lighted passage.    From beneath a door on the left, and near the end, a brighter light  shone. Beyond that again was another door. A voice was speaking in the  lighted room; yet I could have sworn that Karamaneh had come, not from  there but from the room beyond--from the far end of the passage.    But the voice!--who, having once heard it, could ever mistake that  singular voice, alternately guttural and sibilant.    Dr. Fu-Manchu was speaking!    \"I have asked you,\" came with ever-increasing clearness (Smith had  begun to turn the knob), \"to reveal to me the name of your  correspondent in Nan-Yang. I have suggested that he may be the  Mandarin Yen-Sun-Yat, but you have declined to confirm me. Yet I know\"  (Smith had the door open a good three inches and was peering in) \"that  some official, some high official, is a traitor. Am I to resort again  to _the question_ to learn his name?\"    Ice seemed to enter my veins at the unseen inquisitor's intonation of  the words \"_the question_.\" This was the twentieth century; yet there,  in that damnable room....    Smith threw the door open.    Through a sort of haze, born mostly of horror, but not entirely, I saw  Eltham, stripped to the waist and tied, with his arms upstretched, to  a rafter in the ancient ceiling. A Chinaman, who wore a slop-shop blue  suit and who held an open knife in his hand, stood beside him. Eltham  was ghastly white. The appearance of his chest puzzled me momentarily,  then I realized that a sort of _tourniquet_ of wire-netting was  screwed so tightly about him that the flesh swelled out in knobs  through the mesh. There was blood--    \"God in heaven!\" screamed Smith frenziedly, \"_they have the  wire-jacket on him!_ Shoot down that damned Chinaman, Petrie! Shoot!  Shoot!\"    Lithely as a cat the man with the knife leapt around--but I raised the  Browning, and deliberately--with a cool deliberation that came to me  suddenly--shot him through the head. I saw his oblique eyes turn up to  the whites; I saw the mark squarely between his brows; and with no word  nor cry he sank to his knees and toppled forward with one yellow hand  beneath him and one outstretched, clutching--clutching--convulsively.  His pigtail came unfastened and began to uncoil, slowly, like a snake.    I handed the pistol to Smith; I was perfectly cool, now; and I leapt  forward, took up the bloody knife from the floor and cut Eltham's  lashings. He sank into my arms.    \"Praise God,\" he murmured weakly. \"He is more merciful to me than  perhaps I deserve. Unscrew ... the jacket, Petrie ... I think ... I was  very near to ... weakening. Praise the good God, who ... gave me ...  fortitude....\"    I got the screw of the accursed thing loosened, but the act of  removing the jacket was too agonizing for Eltham--man of iron though  he was. I laid him swooning on the floor.    \"Where is Fu-Manchu?\"    Nayland Smith, from just within the door, threw out the query in a  tone of stark amaze."]]]
