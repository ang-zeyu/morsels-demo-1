[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1825"],[0,"The Adventures of Reddy Fox (#4)"],[1,"forgot all about how mean Reddy had been.    \"Poor Reddy Fox,\" said Peter Rabbit. \"Poor Reddy Fox.\"          XI. Granny Fox Returns    Up over the hill trotted old Granny Fox. She was on her way home with  a tender young chicken for Reddy Fox. Poor Reddy! Of course, it was his  own fault, for he had been showing off and he had been careless or he  never would have gone so near to the old tree trunk behind which Farmer  Brown's boy was hiding.    But old Granny Fox didn't know this. She never makes such mistakes  herself. Oh, my, no! So now, as she came up over the hill to a place  where she could see her home, she laid the chicken down and then she  crept behind a little bush and looked all over the Green Meadows to see  if the way was clear. She knew that Bowser the Hound was chained up. She  had seen Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown's boy hoeing in the cornfield, so  she had nothing to fear from them.    Looking over to her doorstep, she saw Reddy Fox lying in the sun, and  then she saw something else, something that made her eyes flash and her  teeth come together with a snap. It was Peter Rabbit sitting up very  straight, not ten feet from Reddy Fox.    \"So that's that young scamp of a Peter Rabbit whom Reddy was going to  catch for me when I was sick and couldn't! I'll just show Reddy Fox how  easily it can be done, and he shall have tender young rabbit with his  chicken!\" said Granny Fox to herself.    So first she studied and studied every clump of grass and every bush  behind which she could creep. She saw that she could get almost to where  Peter Rabbit was sitting and never once show herself to him. Then  she looked this way and looked that way to make sure that no one was  watching her.    No one did she see on the Green Meadows who was looking her way. Then  Granny Fox began to crawl from one clump of grass to another and from  bush to bush. Sometimes she wriggled along flat on her stomach. Little  by little she was drawing nearer and nearer to Peter Rabbit.    Now with all her smartness old Granny Fox had forgotten one thing. Yes,  Sir, she had forgotten one thing. Never once had she thought to look up  in the sky.    And there was Ol' Mistah Buzzard sailing round and round and looking  down and seeing all that was going on below.    Ol' Mistah Buzzard is sharp. He knew just what old Granny Fox was  planning to do--knew it as well as if he had read her thoughts. His eyes  twinkled.    \"Ah cert'nly can't allow li'l' Brer Rabbit to be hurt, Ah cert'nly  can't!\" muttered Ol' Mistah Buzzard, and chuckled.    Then he slanted his broad wings downward and without a sound slid down  out of the sky till he was right behind Granny Fox.    \"Do yo' always crawl home, Granny Fox?\" asked Ol' Mistah Buzzard.    Granny Fox was so startled, for she hadn't heard a sound, that she  jumped almost out of her skin. Of course Peter Rabbit saw her then, and  was off like a shot.    Granny Fox showed all her teeth. \"I wish you would mind your own  business, Mistah Buzzard!\" she snarled.    \"Cert'nly, cert'nly, Ah sho'ly will!\" replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard, and  sailed up into the blue, blue sky.          XII. The Lost Chicken    When old Granny Fox had laid down the chicken she was bringing home to  Reddy Fox to try to catch Peter Rabbit, she had meant to go right back  and get it as soon as she had caught Peter. Now she saw Peter going  across the Green Meadows, lipperty-lipperty-lip, as fast as he could go.  She was so angry that she hopped up and down. She tore up the grass and  ground her long, white teeth. She glared up at Ol' Mistah Buzzard, who  had warned Peter Rabbit, but all she could do was to scold, and that  didn't do her much good, for in a few minutes Ol' Mistah Buzzard was  so far up in the blue, blue sky that he couldn't hear a word she was  saying. My, my, but old Granny Fox certainly was angry! If she hadn't  been so angry she might have seen Johnny Chuck lying as flat as he could  make himself behind a big clump of grass.    Johnny Chuck was scared. Yes, indeed, Johnny Chuck was dreadfully  scared. He had fought Reddy Fox and whipped him, but he knew that old  Granny Fox would be too much for him. So it was with great relief that  Johnny Chuck saw her stop tearing up the grass and trot over to see how  Reddy Fox was getting along. Then Johnny Chuck crept along until he was  far enough away to run. How he did run! He was so fat and roly-poly that  he was all out of breath when he reached home, and so tired that he just  dropped down on his doorstep and panted.    \"Serves me right for having so much curiosity,\" said Johnny Chuck to  himself.    Reddy Fox looked up as old Granny Fox came hurrying home. He was weak  and very, very hungry. But he felt sure that old Granny Fox would  bring him something nice for his breakfast, and as soon as he heard her  footsteps his mouth began to water.    \"Did you bring me something nice, Granny?\" asked Reddy Fox.    Now old Granny Fox had been so put out by the scare she had had and by  her failure to catch Peter Rabbit that she had forgotten all about the  chicken she had left up on the hill. When Reddy spoke, she remembered  it, and the thought of having to go way back after it didn't improve her  temper a bit.    \"No!\" she snapped. \"I haven't!--You don't deserve any breakfast anyway.  If you had any gumption\"--that's the word Granny Fox used, gumption--\"if  you had any gumption at all, you wouldn't have gotten in trouble, and  could get your own breakfast.\"    Reddy Fox didn't know what gumption meant, but he did know that he was  very, very hungry, and do what he would, he couldn't keep back a couple  of big tears of disappointment. Granny Fox saw them.    \"There, there, Reddy! Don't cry. I've got a fine fat chicken for you up  on the hill, and I'll run back and get it,\" said Granny Fox.    So off she started up the hill to the place where she had left the  chicken when she started to try to catch Peter Rabbit. When she got  there, there wasn't any chicken. No, Sir, there was no chicken at  all--just a few feathers. Granny Fox could hardly believe her own eyes.  She looked this way and she looked that way, but there was no chicken,  just a few feathers. Old Granny Fox flew into a greater rage than  before.          XIII. Granny Fox Calls Jimmy Skunk Names    Granny Fox couldn't believe her own eyes. No, Sir, she couldn't believe  her own eyes, and she rubbed them two or three times to make sure that  she was seeing right. That chicken certainly had disappeared, and left  no trace of where it had gone.    It was very queer. Old Granny Fox sat down to think who would dare steal  anything from her. Then she walked in a big circle with her nose to the  ground, sniffing and sniffing. What was she doing that for? Why, to  see if she could find the tracks of anyone who might have stolen her  chicken.    \"Aha!\" exclaimed old Granny Fox, starting to run along the top of the  hill, her nose to the ground. \"Aha! I'll catch him this time!\"    In a few minutes she began to run more slowly, and every two or three  steps she would look ahead. Suddenly her eyes snapped, and she began  to creep almost flat on her stomach, just as she had crept for Peter  Rabbit. But it wasn't Peter Rabbit this time. It was--who do you think?  Jimmy Skunk! Yes, Sir, it was Jimmy Skunk. He was slowly ambling along,  for Jimmy Skunk never hurries. Every big stick or stone that he could  move, he would pull over or look under, for Jimmy Skunk was hunting for  beetles.    Old Granny Fox watched him. \"He must have a tremendous appetite to be  hunting for beetles after eating my chicken!\" muttered she. Then  she jumped out in front of Jimmy Skunk, her eyes snapping, her teeth  showing, and the hair on her back standing on end so as to make her look  very fierce. But all the time old Granny Fox took the greatest care not  to get too near to Jimmy Skunk.    \"Where's my chicken?\" snarled old Granny Fox, and she looked very, very  fierce.    Jimmy Skunk looked up as if very much surprised. \"Hello, Granny Fox!\" he  exclaimed. \"Have you lost a chicken?\"    \"You've stolen it! You're a thief, Jimmy Skunk!\" snapped Granny Fox.         \"Words can never make black white;       Before you speak be sure you're right,\"    said Jimmy Skunk. \"I'm not a thief.\"    \"You are!\" cried Granny working herself into a great rage.    \"I'm not!\"    \"You are!\"    All the time Jimmy Skunk was chuckling to himself, and the more he  chuckled the angrier grew old Granny Fox. And all the time Jimmy Skunk  kept moving toward old Granny Fox and Granny Fox kept backing away, for,  like all the other little meadow and forest people, she has very great  respect for Jimmy Skunk's little bag of scent.    Now, backing off that way, she couldn't see where she was going, and  the first thing she knew she had backed into a bramble bush. It tore her  skirts and scratched her legs. \"Ooch!\" cried old Granny Fox.    \"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed Jimmy Skunk. \"That's what you get for calling me  names.\"          XIV. Granny Fox Finds What Became of the Chicken    Old Granny Fox was in a terrible temper. Dear, dear, it certainly was  a dreadful temper! Jimmy Skunk laughed at her, and that made it worse.  When he saw this, Jimmy Skunk just rolled over and over on the ground  and shouted, he was so tickled. Of course, it wasn't the least bit nice  of Jimmy Skunk, but you know that Granny Fox had been calling Jimmy  a thief. Then Jimmy doesn't like Granny Fox anyway, nor do any of the  other little meadow and forest people, for most of them are very much  afraid of her.    When old Granny Fox finally got out of the bramble bush, she didn't stop  to say anything more to Jimmy Skunk, but hurried away, muttering and  grumbling and grinding her teeth. Old Granny Fox wasn't pleasant to meet  just then, and when Bobby Coon saw her coming, he just thought it best  to get out of her way, so he climbed a tree.    It wasn't that Bobby Coon was afraid of old Granny Fox. Bless "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#4)"],[1,"&c. For as knowledge and time discouereth errors, so dooth  superstition and ignorance in time breed them.\"    The passage which I next quote, is a further specimen of the  impressive and even eloquent earnestness with which he pleads his  cause:--    \"In the meane time, I would wish them to know that if neither the  estimation of Gods omnipotencie, nor the tenor of his word, nor the  doubtfulnes or rather the impossibilitie of the case, nor the small  proofes brought against them, nor the rigor executed vpon them, nor  the pitie that should be in a christian heart, nor yet their  simplicitie, impotencie, or age may suffice to suppresse the rage or  rigor wherewith they are oppressed; yet the consideration of their sex  or kind ought to mooue some mitigation of their punishment. For if  nature (as Plinie reporteth) haue taught a lion not to deale so  roughlie with a woman as with a man, bicause she is in bodie the  weaker vessell, and in hart more inclined to pitie (which Ieremie in  his lamentations seemeth to confirme) what should a man doo in this  case, for whome a woman was created as an helpe and comfort vnto him?  In so much as, euen in the lawe of nature, it is a greater offense to  slea a woman than a man: not bicause a man is not the more excellent  creature, but bicause a woman is the weaker vessell. And therefore  among all modest and honest persons it is thought a shame to offer  violence or iniurie to a woman: in which respect Virgil saith, _Nullum  memorabile nomen foeminea in poena est_.    \"God that knoweth my heart is witnes, and you that read my booke shall  see, that my drift and purpose in this enterprise tendeth onelie to  these respects. First, that the glorie and power of God be not so  abridged and abased, as to be thrust into the hand or lip of a lewd  old woman: whereby the worke of the Creator should be attributed to  the power of a creature. Secondlie, that the religion of the gospell  may be seene to stand without such peeuish trumperie. Thirdlie, that  lawfull fauour and christian compassion be rather vsed towards these  poore soules, than rigor and extremitie. Bicause they, which are  commonlie accused of witchcraft, are the least sufficient of all other  persons to speake for themselues; as hauing the most base and simple  education of all others; the extremitie of their age giuing them leaue  to dote, their pouertie to beg, their wrongs to chide and threaten (as  being void of anie other waie of reuenge) their humor melancholicall  to be full of imaginations, from whence cheefelie proceedeth the  vanitie of their confessions; as that they can transforme themselues  and others into apes, owles, asses, dogs, cats, &c: that they can flie  in the aire, kill children with charmes, hinder the comming of butter,  &c.    \"And for so much as the mightie helpe themselues together, and the  poore widowes crie, though it reach to heauen, is scarse heard here  vpon earth: I thought good (according to my poore abilitie) to make  intercession, that some part of common rigor, and some points of  hastie iudgement may be aduised vpon. For the world is now at that  stay (as Brentius in a most godlie sermon in these words affirmeth)  that euen as when the heathen persecuted the christians, if anie were  accused to beleeue in Christ, the common people cried _Ad leonem_: so  now, if anie woman, be she neuer so honest, be accused of witchcraft,  they crie _Ad ignem_.\"]    [Footnote 19: In the intervening period between the publication of  Soot's work and the advertisement of Filmer, several books came out on  the subject of witchcraft. Amongst them it is right to notice \"A  Dialogue concerning Witches and Witchcraft, by George Giffard,  Minister of God's Word in Maldon,\" 1593, 4to. This tract, which has  been reprinted by the Percy Society, is not free from the leading  fallacies which infected the reasonings of almost all the writers on  witchcraft. It is, nevertheless, exceedingly entertaining, and well  deserves a perusal, if only as transmitting to us, in their full  freshness, the racy colloquialisms of the age of Elizabeth. It is to  be hoped that the other works of Giffard, all of which are deserving  of attention, independently of their theological interest, as  specimens of pure and sterling English, may appear in a collected  form. The next tract requiring notice is \"The Trial of Witchcraft, by  John Cotta,\" 1616, 4to, of which a second and enlarged edition was  published in 1624. Cotta, who was a physician of great eminence and  experience, residing at Northampton, has supplied in this very able,  learned, and vigorous treatise, a groundwork which, if pursued to its  just results, for he writes very cautiously and guardedly, and rather  hints at his conclusions than follows them out, would have sufficed to  have overthrown many of the positions of the supporters of the system  of witchcraft. His work has a strong scholastic tinge, and is not  without occasional obscurity; and on these accounts probably produced  no very extensive impression at the time. He wrote two other  tracts--1. \"Discovery of the Dangers of ignorant practisers of Physick  in England,\" 1612, 4to; 2. \"Cotta contra Antonium, or An Ant-Anthony,\"  Oxford, 1623, 4to; the latter of which, a keen satire against the  chymists' aurum potabile, is exceedingly rare. Both are intrinsically  valuable and interesting, and written with great vigour of style, and  are full of curious illustrations derived from his extensive medical  practice. I cannot conclude this note without adverting to Gaule's  amusing little work, (\"Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and  Witchcraft, by John Gaule, Preacher of the Word at Great Haughton, in  the county of Huntingdon,\" 1646, 24mo.) which gives us all the  casuistry applicable to witchcraft. We can almost forgive Gaule's  fundamental errors on the general question, for the courage and spirit  with which he battled with the villainous witchfinder, Hopkins, who  wanted sorely to make an example of him, to the terror of all  gainsayers of the sovereign power of this examiner-general of witches.  Gaule proved himself to be an overmatch for the itinerating  inquisitor, and so effectually attacked, battled with, and exposed  him, as to render him quite harmless in future. The minister of Great  Haughton was made of different metal to the \"old reading parson  Lewis,\" or Lowes, to whose fate Baxter refers with such nonchalance.  As the only clergyman of the Church of England, that I am aware of,  who was executed for witchcraft, Lewis's case is sufficiently  interesting to merit some notice. Stearne's (vide his _Confirmation of  Witchcraft_, p. 23,) account of it, which I have not seen quoted  before, is as follows:--    \"Thus was Parson Lowis taken, who had been a Minister, (as I have  heard) in one Parish above forty yeares, in Suffolke, before he was  condemned, but had been indited for a common imbarriter, and for  Witchcraft, above thirty yeares before, and the grand Jury (as I have  heard) found the bill for a common imbarriter, who now, after he was  found with the markes, in his confession, he confessed, that in pride  of heart, to be equall, or rather above God, the Devill tooke  advantage of him, and hee covenanted with the Devill, and sealed it  with his bloud, and had three Familiars or spirits, which sucked on  the markes found upon his body, and did much harme, both by Sea and  Land, especially by Sea, for he confessed, that he being at Lungarfort  in Suffolke, where he preached, as he walked upon the wall, or workes  there, he saw a great saile of Ships passe by, and that as they were  sailing by, one of his three Impes, namely his yellow one, forthwith  appeared to him, and asked him what hee should doe, and he bade it goe  and sinke such a Ship, and shewed his Impe a new Ship, amongst the  middle of the rest (as I remember) one that belonged to Ipswich, so he  confessed the Impe went forthwith away, and he stood still, and viewed  the Ships on the Sea as they were a sayling, and perceived that Ship  immediately, to be in more trouble and danger then the rest; for he  said, the water was more boystrous neere that then the rest, tumbling  up and down with waves, as if water had been boyled in a pot, and  soone after (he said) in a short time it sanke directly downe into the  Sea, as he stood and viewed it, when all the rest sayled away in  safety, there he confessed, he made fourteen widdowes in one quarter  of an houre. Then Mr. Hopkin, as he told me (for he tooke his  Confession) asked him, if it did not grieve him to see so many men  cast away, in a short time, and that he should be the cause of so many  poore widdowes on a suddaine, but he swore by his maker, no, he was  joyfull to see what power his Impes had, and so likewise confessed  many other mischiefes, and had a charme to keep him out of Goale, and  hanging, as he paraphrased it himselfe, but therein the Devill  deceived him; for he was hanged, that Michaelmas time 1645. at Burie  Saint Edmunds, but he made a very farre larger confession, which I  have heard hath been printed: but if it were so, it was neither of Mr.  Hopkins doing nor mine owne; for we never printed anything untill  now.\"    Hutchinson gives the explanation of this confession. What can be more  atrocious than the whole story, which is yet but the common story of  witch confessions?    \"_Adv._ Then did not he confess this before the Commissioners, at the  Time of his Tryal?    \"_Clerg._ No, but maintained his Innocence stoutly, and challenged  them to make Proof of such Things as they laid to his Charge. I had  this from a Person of Credit, who was then in Court, and heard his  Tryal. I may add, that tho' his Case is remembered better than others  that suffered, yet I never heard any one speak of him, but with great  Compassion, because of his Age and Character, and their Belief of his  Innocence: And when he came to his Execution, because he would"]]]
