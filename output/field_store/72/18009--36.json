But the use of this name has not, I believe, been generally  associated with any question of linguistics.    The area in the map which is called by the Fathers Boboi is occupied  by people whose language, I was told by the Fathers, is Papuan,  but is distinct from the languages of the Ambo and the Fuyuge areas.    Kamaweka is a name which appears in several of Dr. Seligmann's  publications. It seems to have been originally used by Captain  Barton to designate the natives of the district of which Inavaurene,  to the north-east of the Mekeo plains, is the centre, but to have  been afterwards regarded as a somewhat more general term; and I think  Dr. Seligmann uses it in a very general sense, almost, if not quite,  equivalent to the wide application above referred to of the term Kovio,  and which might include the Papuan-speaking Boboi and Ambo people, and  even perhaps the people of the northern Mafulu villages. [4] But here  again the use of the name has, I think, no reference to linguistics.    If the Fathers' linguistic boundary lines are substantially correct,  each of the two terms Kovio and Kamaweka, as now used, would appear  to cover more than one linguistic area; and in any case these terms  seem to have widened and to have become somewhat indefinite. It will  be seen on reference to the map and to Father Egedi's information  as to the Oru Lopiku and Boboi boundaries that both Mt. Yule and  Inavaurene are within the area which the Fathers call Oru Lopiku, but  that Inavaurene is not far from their Boboi area. I suggest that it  would be convenient for the present, pending further investigation  and delimitation on the spot, and until we know something of the  difference between the languages of the Oru Lopiku and Boboi people,  to adopt the term Kovio as a general name for, and confine it to,  the two areas Boboi and Oru Lopiku; though for linguistic purposes  the names Boboi and Oru Lopiku, which at present indicate very little  to us, may eventually be accepted and come into general use.    The Koiari people of the foothills and lateral spurs behind the Motu  area, also referred to from time to time in Dr. Seligmann's writings,  must be eastern next door neighbours of the Fuyuge-speaking people,  the western boundary of these Koiari being stated by him to be the  Vanapa river, [5] and they being in fact regarded by him as being  the eastern neighbours of the natives of \"the mountains inland of  Mekeo Nara and Kabadi,\" [6] and being referred to by him as being  the people from whose district the Kamaweka and Kuni are reached by  \"passing westward\"--the word used is \"eastward,\" but this is obviously  a printer's error--\"in the mountains, keeping roughly parallel with  the coast.\" [7]    Turning to the question of the Fuyuge boundary, Dr. Strong says that  the Fuyuge people occupy the upper waters of the St. Joseph river,  [8] and he is quoted by Dr. Seligmann as having stated that the Afoa  language \"is spoken in the villages on Mt. Pizoko and the northern  slopes of Mt. Davidson,\" and that \"the Afoa villages lie to the north  of the Fuyuge-speaking communities, stretching westward for an unknown  distance behind Mt. Davidson.\" [9] If the information given to me  verbally by the Fathers of the Mission of the Sacred Heart and the  red linguistic boundary lines roughly drawn by them, and introduced  into my map, be correct, these statements require modification, for  according to the Fathers the Mafulu or Fuyuge-speaking area does not  include any part of the St. Joseph river, as its extreme north-westerly  corner lies to the east of the junction--close to the boundary line  between the Afoa (Ambo) and the Kuni areas--of the rivers Alabula  and Aduala, and Mt. Pizoko is within the Fuyuge area, and not within  that of the Afoa, and Mt. Davidson is within the Boboi area. I think  that, though the Fathers' lines are admittedly not exact, they and  the information supplied by the Fathers to me are likely to be more  trustworthy in these respects, especially as regards boundaries near to  the actual Mafulu villages, than the earlier statements of Dr. Strong,  as they are the outcome of recent and careful investigation; and,  as regards Mt. Pizoko, I may mention that Dr. Strong himself seems to  have subsequently regarded that mountain as being within the Mafulu  district, [10] which brings it into the Fuyuge area.    The inclusion of the upper valley of the river Chirima within the  Fuyuge or Mafulu-speaking area is perhaps surprising, as this valley is  separated from the general Fuyuge area by one of the southern ridges  of Mt. Albert Edward, and more or less so by the ridges of Mt. Stone  Wigg and the Wharton range, and as the Chirima is a tributary flowing  into the Mambare river, which is one of the great watercourses of  Northern New Guinea. The Mafulu Fathers, however, had no doubt as  to the correctness of the inclusion, which seems to open out the  possibility of some, at all events, of the Fuyuge people having  northern associations; and indeed Monseigneur de Boismenu told me  that he believed that the Mafulu people were in touch with Northern  New Guinea, and got some of their shell ornaments, or the shells from  which they were made, from the northern coast.    It is interesting, therefore, to turn for the purpose of comparison  to the report of Mr. Monckton's expedition to Mt. Albert Edward by  way of the Upper Chirima valley in 1906 [11] and the illustrations  accompanying it, with which I incorporate a description of the people  of this valley given to Dr. Seligmann by Mr. Money, who was with  Mr. Monckton. [12]    From these it appears that the Upper Chirima people are short in  stature and sturdily built. Both sexes wear the perineal band,  the front of which is made (I am not sure whether this applies to  women as well as to men) to bulge out by padding. In some cases the  men's hair is tied up in a bunch with string, and in others it is  bound up in various styles with native cloth. Some of the men have  their hair done up in small plaits over the forehead. All the above  descriptions, except that of the padding of the band, are applicable to  the Mafulu. Some of the Chirima houses have a curious apse-like roof  projection over the front platform, which is a specially distinctive  feature of a Mafulu house, and one with this projection figured by  Mr. Monckton is indistinguishable from a typical Mafulu house. The  Chirima people place the bodies of their dead on raised platforms,  and apparently sometimes put the body of an infant on the platform  erection of an adult, but below the latter. This also is a practice  of the Mafulu; and, though the latter people confine platform burial  (if such it may be called) to chiefs and their families and important  persons, it is possible that some such limitation of the custom exists  in the Chirima valley also, but did not come under Mr. Monckton's  notice. A burial platform figured by him might well be a Mafulu burial  platform, except that the curious cone-shaped receptacle for the child  is a form for which I cannot vouch as regards the Mafulu. The Chirima  have a special and peculiar form of netting, which Mr. Monckton's  illustration shows to be identical with the special form of Mafulu  netting. On the other hand, as regards the Chirima weapons, implements  and utensils, a comparison of Mr. Monckton's verbal descriptions and  figures with what I have seen in Mafulu, and describe in this book,  leads me to the conclusion that, though many of these are similar to  those of Mafulu, some of them are different. As examples of this I may  say that the drill implements of the Chirima people are very similar  to, and their stone cloth-beaters appear to be identical with, those  used by the Mafulu; whilst on the other hand their war bows are much  longer, [13] and their method of producing fire seems to be totally  different; also they apparently have bull-roarers, which to the best  of my knowledge are unknown among the Mafulu. Again some of the Chirima  weapons, as figured by Mr. Monckton, disclose ideas of artistic design,  including that of the curved line and a rude representation of a man,  which I have not met with among the Mafulu. As regards this last  point I draw attention to Mr. Monckton's figures of carving on a bow  and on wooden clubs. I think, however, that in such matters as these  local differences might well arise between people who are really  more or less identical, especially if their respective districts  are on opposite sides of the main mountain range of the country, and  still more so if the people of one of the districts (in the present  case I refer to the Chirima people) may perhaps have been subject to  the influence of other people beyond them. As to this latter point,  however, I should say that these Chirima people seem to be, so far as  dress, ornaments, &c., are concerned, much nearer to the Mafulu than  they are to the natives of the Mambare river itself, as described  by Sir William Macgregor. [14] It is curious also that the dogs of  the Chirima people are not yellow dingoes, but are black and white,  as is the case in Mafulu.    I notice that Dr. Seligmann suggests that these Chirima valley people  are related to the natives of the neighbourhood of Mt. Yule, [15] a  statement which, though probably intended broadly, is in accord with  the suggestion that they are connected with the Mafulu-speaking people.    The natives of Mt. Scratchley (apparently the eastern or south-eastern  side), visited by Sir William Macgregor in 1896, appear from his  description of them [16] to show a few points of resemblance to the  Mafulu people. In particular I refer to their \"dark bronze\" colour,  to the wearing by women of the perineal band (to which, however, is  added a mantle and \"in most cases\" a grass petticoat, which is not done  in Mafulu), to the absence of tattooing or cicatrical ornamentation,  to their \"large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#4)"],[1,"transition to the time when the  Oriental movement in Germany really began.    After the Portuguese had sailed around Africa, direct and uninterrupted  communication with the far East was established. Portuguese, Dutch,  French and English merchants appeared successively on the scene to get  their share of the rich India commerce. German merchants also made a  transitory effort. The firm of the Welsers in Augsburg sent two  representatives who accompanied the expedition of Francisco d' Almeida  in 1505 and that of Tristao da Cunha in the following year. But  conditions were not favorable and the attempt was not renewed.[49]    Travels to India and Persia now multiplied rapidly, and accounts of such  travels became very common; so common, in fact, that already in the  sixteenth century collections of them were made, the best known being  the _Novus Orbis_ of Grynaeus, and the works of Ramusio and Hakluyt.  Among the more famous travellers of the sixteenth century we may mention  Barthema, Federici, Barbosa, Fitch and van Linschoten for India, and the  brothers Shirley for Persia. In the seventeenth century we may cite the  names of della Valle, Baldaeus, Tavernier, Bernier and the German  Mandelslo for India, while those of Olearius and Chardin are most famous  in connection with Persia. And that books of travel were much read in  Germany is attested by the number of editions and translations which  appeared there. Thus among the earliest books printed there we have a  translation of Marco Polo (Nuremberg), 1477,[50] reprinted repeatedly,  e.g. at Augsburg, 1481, in the _Novus Orbis_, 1534 (Latin version), at  Basle, 1534 (German translation of the preceding), while Mandeville's  memoirs were so popular as to become finally a _Volksbuch_.[51]    The account of Olearius is of special interest to us. It gives an  excellent description of Persia, and above all it gives us valuable  information on the literature and language. Olearius is struck by the  similarity of many Persian words to corresponding words in German and  Latin, and hints at the kinship of these idioms, though, looking only at  the vocabulary and not at the structure, he supposes Persian to be  related to Arabic.[52] He tells us of the high esteem in which poetry  was held by the Persians, and notices that rhyme is an indispensable  requisite of their poetic art. He also mentions some of their leading  poets, among them Sa'di, Hafid, Firdausi and Nidami.[53]           *       *       *       *       *    But what interests us most is the translation which he made of the  _Gulistan_, published in 1654, under the title of _Persianischer  Rosenthal_. True, it was not the first in point of time. As early as  1634 du Ryer had published at Paris an incomplete French version, and  shortly afterwards this version was translated into German by Johann  Friedrich Ochsenbach of Tuebingen, but apparently without attracting much  notice.[54] In 1644, Levin Warner of Leyden had given the Persian text  and Latin version of a number of Sa'di's maxims,[55] while Gentius had  published the whole text with a Latin translation at Amsterdam in 1651.  But it was the version of Olearius that really introduced the _Gulistan_  to Europe.    The edition of Olearius, from which we have cited, contains also a  translation of the _Bustan_, called _Der Persianische Baumgarten_, made,  however, not directly from the Persian, but from a Dutch version.  Besides this, the edition contains also the narratives of two other  travellers, Juergen Andersen and Volquard Iversen, as well as an account  of Persia by the French missionary Sanson. Iversen, in speaking of the  Parsi religion, gives an essentially correct account of the Zoroastrian  hierarchy, of the supreme god and his seven servants, each presiding  over some special element, evidently an allusion to Ahura Mazda and his  six Amesha Spentas, with the possible addition of Sraosha.[56] Sanson  states that the _Gavres_ have kept up the old Persian language and that  it is entirely different from modern Persian,[57] a distinct recognition  of the existence of the Avestan language. The eighteenth century saw the  discovery of the _Avesta_ by Anquetil du Perron, and its close found men  like Jones, Revizky, de Sacy and Hammer busily engaged in spreading a  knowledge of Persian literature in Europe.           *       *       *       *       *    India, as far as its literature was concerned, did not fare so well. The  struggles of European nations for the mastery of that rich empire did  little towards promoting a knowledge of its religion or its language.  Nor were the efforts of missionaries very successful. Most of their  attention was devoted to the Dravidian idioms of Southern India, not to  Sanskrit. We have the authority of Friedrich Schlegel for the statement  that before his time there were but two Germans who were known to have  gained a knowledge of the sacred language, the missionary Heinrich Roth  and the Jesuit Hanxleben.[58] Even their work was not published and was  superseded by that of Jones, Colebrooke and others. Most valuable  information on Hindu religion was given by the Dutch preacher Abraham  Roger in his well known book _De Open-Deure tot het Verborgen  Heydendom_, published at Leyden in 1651, two years after the author's  death. This book also gave to the West the first specimen of Sanskrit  literature in the shape of a Dutch version of two hundred maxims of  Bhartrhari, not a direct translation from the Sanskrit, but based on  oral communication imparted by a learned Brahman Padmanaba.[59] As a  rule the rendering is very faithful, sometimes even literal. The maxims  were translated into German by C. Arnold and were published at Nuremberg  in 1663.    This, however, ended the progress of Sanskrit literature in Europe for  the time being. Information came in very slowly. The _Lettres  Edifiantes_ of the Jesuits, and the accounts of travellers like Sonnerat  began to shed additional light on the religious customs of India, but  its sacred language remained a secret. In 1785, Herder wrote that what  Europe knew of Hindu literature was only late legends, that the Sanskrit  language as well as the genuine Veda would probably for a long time  remain unknown.[60] Sir William Jones, however, had founded the Asiatic  Society a year before and the first step towards the discovery of  Sanskrit had really thus been taken.    But let us consider what bearing all this had on German poetry. In this  field the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were desperately dreary.  In the former century the leading thinkers of Germany were absorbed in  theological controversy, while in the next the Thirty Years' War  completely crushed the spirit of the nation. There is little poetry in  this period that calls for even passing notice in this investigation.  Paul Fleming, although he was with Olearius in Persia, has written  nothing that would interest us here. Andreas Gryphius took the subject  for his drama \"Catharina von Georgien\" (1657) from Persian history. It  is the story of the cruel execution of the Georgian queen by order of  Shah 'Abbas in 1624.[61] Nor is Oriental influence in the eighteenth  century more noticeable. Occasionally an Oriental touch is brought in.  Pfeffel makes his \"Bramine\" read a lesson to bigots; Matthias Claudius  in his well-known poem makes Herr Urian pay a visit to the Great Mogul;  Buerger, in his salacious story of the queen of Golkonde, transports the  lovers to India; Lessing, in \"Minna von Barnhelm\" (Act i. Sc. 12)  represents Werner as intending to take service with Prince Heraklius of  Persia, and he chooses an Oriental setting for his \"Nathan der Weise.\"           *       *       *       *       *    In the prose writings of this period Oriental influence is much more  discernible. In the literature dealing with magic Zoroaster always  played a prominent part. The invention of the Cabala was commonly  ascribed to him.[62] European writers on the black art, as for instance  Bodinus, whose _De Magorum Daemonomania_ was translated by Fischart  (Strassburg, 1591), repeat about Zoroaster all the fables found in  classical or patristic writers. So the Iranian sage figures prominently  also in the Faust-legend. He is the prince of magicians whose book Faust  studies so diligently that he is called a second Zoroastris.[63] This  book passes into the hands of Faust's pupil Christoph Wagner, who uses  it as diligently as his master.[64]    In all this folkbook-literature India is a mere name. Thus in the oldest  Faust-book of 1587 the sorcerer makes a journey in the air through  England, Spain, France, Sweden, Poland, Denmark, India, Africa and  Persia, and finally comes to _Morenland_.[65]    Of all the prose-writings, however, the novel, which began to flourish  luxuriously in the seventeenth century, showed the most marked tendency  to make use of Eastern scenery and episodes, and incidentally to exhibit  the author's erudition on everything Oriental. Thus Grimmelshausen  transports his hero Simplicissimus into Asia through the device of  Tartar captivity. Lohenstein, in his ultra-Teutonic romance of Arminius,  manages to introduce an Armenian princess and a prince from Pontus. The  latter, as we learn from the autobiography with which he favors us in  the fifth book, has been in India. He took with him a Brahman sage, who  burned himself on reaching Greece. Evidently Lohenstein had read  Arrian's description of the burning of Kalanos (Arrian vii. 2, 3). The  _Asiatische Banise_ of Heinrich Anselm von Ziegler-Kliphausen, perhaps  the most popular German novel of the seventeenth century, was based  directly on the accounts of travellers to Farther India, not on Greek or  Latin writings.[66] Other authors who indulged their predilection for  Oriental scenery were Buchholtz in his _Herkules und Valisca_ (1659),  Happel in _Der Asiatische Onogambo_ (Hamb. 1673), Bohse (Talander) in  _Die"]]]
