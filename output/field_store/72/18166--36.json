The Princess was  rejoiced to see him again, but was very sorry to find that she had  been the cause of all their trouble by parting with the wonderful  Lamp. Aladdin, however, consoled her, and told her that he had thought  of a plan for getting it back. He then left her, but soon returned  with a powerful sleeping-draught, and advised her to receive the  Magician with pretended kindness, and pour it into his wine at dinner  that day, so as to make him fall sound asleep, when they could take  the Lamp from him. Everything happened as they expected; the Magician  drank the wine, and when Aladdin came in, he found that he had fallen  back lifeless on the couch. Aladdin took the Lamp from his bosom, and  called upon the Genius to transport the Palace, the Princess, and  himself, back to their native city. The Sultan was as much astonished  and pleased at their return, as he had been provoked at the loss of  his daughter; and Aladdin, with his Bulbul, lived long afterwards to  enjoy his good fortune.

Every day for two weeks she went early to the mill in her  plain homespun dress, her straight hair neatly parted and smoothed  over her ears. Proudly she tended the spools. She was skillful and  quick, and received the regular wage of $1.50 a week, which she  divided with Hannah, buying with her share six pale blue coffee cups  for her mother who had allowed her this satisfying adventure.    A few weeks before her thirteenth birthday, Susan became a member of  the Society of Friends which met in nearby Easton, New York, and  learned to search her heart and ask herself, \"Art thou faithful?\"  Parties, dancing, and entertainments were generally ruled out of her  life as sinful, and rarely were a temptation, but occasionally her  mother, remembering her own good times, let her and her sisters go to  parties at the homes of their Presbyterian neighbors, and for this her  father was criticized at Friends' Meeting. Condemning bright colors,  frills, and jewelry as vain and worldly, Susan accepted plain somber  clothing as a mark of righteousness, and when she deviated to the  extent of wearing the Scotch-plaid coat which her mother had bought  her, she wondered if the big rent torn in it by a dog might not be  deserved punishment for her pride in wearing it.    That same year, the family moved into their new brick house of fifteen  rooms, with hard-finish plaster walls and light green woodwork, the  finest house in that part of the country. Here Susan's brother Merritt  was born the next April, and her two-year-old sister, Eliza, died.    Susan, Guelma, and Hannah continued their studies longer than most  girls in the neighborhood, for Quakers not only encouraged but  demanded education for both boys and girls. As soon as Susan and her  sister Guelma were old enough, they taught the \"home\" school in the  summer when the younger children attended, and then went further  afield to teach in nearby villages. At fifteen Susan was teaching a  district school for $1.50 a week and board, and although it was hard  for her to be away from home, she accepted it as a Friend's duty to  provide good education for children. Now Presbyterian neighbors  criticized her father, protesting that well-to-do young ladies should  not venture into paid work.    Daniel Anthony was now a wealthy man, his factory the largest and most  prosperous in that part of the country, and he could afford more and  better education for his daughters. He sent Guelma, the eldest, to  Deborah Moulson's Friends' Seminary near Philadelphia, where for $125  a year \"the inculcation of the principles of Humility, Morality, and  Virtue\" received particular attention; and when Guelma was asked to  stay on a second year as a teacher, he suggested that Susan join her  there as a pupil.           *       *       *       *       *    It was a long journey from Battenville to Philadelphia in 1837, and  when Susan left her home on a snowy afternoon with her father, she  felt as if the parting would be forever. Her first glimpse of the  world beyond Battenville interested her immensely until her father  left her at the seminary, and then she confessed to her diary, \"Oh  what pangs were felt. It seemed impossible for me to part with him. I  could not speak to bid him farewell.\"[8] She tried to comfort herself  by writing letters, and wrote so many and so much that Guelma often  exclaimed, \"Susan, thee writes too much; thee should learn to be  concise.\" As it was a rule of the seminary that each letter must first  be written out carefully on a slate, inspected by Deborah Moulson,  then copied with care, inspected again, and finally sent out after  four or five days of preparation, all spontaneity was stifled and her  letters were stilted and overvirtuous. This censorship left its mark,  and years later she confessed, \"Whenever I take my pen in hand, I  always seem to be mounted on stilts.\"[9]    To her diary she could confide her real feelings--her discouragement  over her lack of improvement and her inability to understand her many  \"sins,\" such as not dotting an _i_, too much laughter, or smiling at  her friends instead of reproving them for frivolous conduct. She  wrote, \"Thought so much of my resolutions to do better in the future  that even my dreams were filled with these desires.... Although I have  been guilty of much levity and nonsensical conversation, and have also  admitted thoughts to occupy my mind which should have been far distant  from it, I do not consider myself as having committed any wilful  offense but perhaps the reason I cannot see my own defects is because  my heart is hardened.\"[10]    The girls studied a variety of subjects, arithmetic, algebra,  literature, chemistry, philosophy, physiology, astronomy, and  bookkeeping. Men came to the school to conduct some of the classes,  and Deborah Moulson was also assisted by several student teachers, one  of whom, Lydia Mott, became Susan's lifelong friend. Susan worked  hard, for she was a conscientious child, but none of her efforts  seemed to satisfy Deborah Moulson, who was a hard taskmaster. Her  reproofs cut deep, and once when Susan protested that she was always  censured while Guelma was praised, Deborah Moulson sternly replied,  \"Thy sister Guelma does the best she is capable of, but thou dost not.  Thou hast greater abilities and I demand of thee the best of thy  capacity.\"[11]    Mail from home was a bright spot, bringing into those busy austere  days news of her friends, and when she read that one of them had  married an old widower with six children, she reflected sagely, \"I  should think any female would rather live and die an old maid.\"[12]    Then came word that her father's business had been so affected by the  financial depression that the family would have to give up their home  in Battenville. Sorrowfully she wrote in her diary, \"O can I ever  forget that loved residence in Battenville, and no more to call it  home seems impossible.\"[13] It helped little to realize that countless  other families throughout the country were facing the future penniless  because banks had failed, mills were shut down, and work on canals and  railroads had ceased. In April 1838, Daniel Anthony came to the  seminary to take his daughters home.    Susan felt keenly her father's sorrow over the failure of his business  and the loss of the home he had built for his family, and she resolved  at once to help out by teaching in Union Village, New York. In May  1838, she wrote in her diary, \"On last evening ... I again left my  home to mingle with strangers which seems to be my sad lot. Separation  was rendered more trying on account of the embarrassing condition of  our business affairs, an inventory was expected to be taken today of  our furniture by assignees.... Spent this day in school, found it  small and quite disorderly. O, may my patience hold out to persevere  without intermission.\"[14]    Her patience did hold out, and also her courage, as the news came from  home telling her how everything had to be sold to satisfy the  creditors, the furniture, her mother's silver spoons, their clothing  and books, the flour, tea, coffee, and sugar in the pantries. She  rejoiced to hear that Uncle Joshua Read from Palatine Bridge, New  York, had come to the rescue, had bought their most treasured and  needed possessions and turned them over to her mother.    On a cold blustery March day in 1839, when she was nineteen, Susan  moved with her family two miles down the Battenkill to the little  settlement of Hardscrabble, later called Center Falls, where her  father owned a satinet factory and grist mill, built in more  prosperous times. These were now heavily mortgaged but he hoped to  save them. They moved into a large house which had been a tavern in  the days when lumber had been cut around Hardscrabble. It was  disappointing after their fine brick house in Battenville, but they  made it comfortable, and their love for and loyalty to each other made  them a happy family anywhere. As it had been a halfway house on the  road to Troy and travelers continued to stop there asking for a meal  or a night's lodging, they took them in, and young Daniel served them  food and nonintoxicating drinks at the old tavern bar.    Susan, when her school term was over, put her energies into housework,  recording in her diary, \"Did a large washing today.... Spent today at  the spinning wheel.... Baked 21 loaves of bread.... Wove three yards  of carpet yesterday.\"[15]    The attic of the tavern had been finished off for a ballroom with  bottles laid under the floor to give a nice tone to the music of the  fiddles, and now the young people of the village wanted to hold their  dancing school there. Susan's father, true to his Quaker training,  felt obliged to refuse, but when they came the second time to tell him  that the only other place available was a disreputable tavern where  liquor was sold, he relented a little, and talked the matter over with  his wife and daughters. Lucy Anthony, recalling her love of dancing,  urged him to let the young people come. Finally he consented on the  condition that Guelma, Hannah, and Susan would not dance. They agreed.  Every two weeks all through the winter, the fiddles played in the  attic room and the boys and girls of the neighborhood danced the  Virginia reel and their rounds and squares, while the three Quaker  girls sat around the wall, watching and longing to join in the fun.    Such frivolous entertainment in the home of a Quaker could not be  condoned, and Daniel Anthony was not only severely censured by the  Friends but read out of Meeting, \"because he kept a place of amusement  in his house.\" But he did not regret his so-called sin any more than  he regretted marrying out of Meeting. He continued to attend Friends'  Meeting, but grew more and more liberal as the years went by. At this  time, like all Quakers, he refused to vote, not wishing in any way to  support a government that "]]]
