Consider how great is this  power! It is an extraordinary Power, an all-sufficient proof of the truth  of the mission of the Prophets of God, and a conclusive evidence of the  power of Divine Inspiration.    The Glory of Glories rest upon thee.  Haifa, 21 September 1921.              FOOTNOTES          1 Original Persian text first published Cairo 1922. This translation        taken from The Baha'i World, Vol. XV, pp. 37-43.        2 'Abdu'l-Baha is obviously referring to the letter from Forel        translated above and dated 28 December 1920.        3 'Abdu'l-Baha refers to His talk at Stanford University, Palo Alto,        California, in 1912, which was published in the local newspaper and        is also included in the collection of His talks in America, entitled        The Promulgation of Universal Peace.        4 There 'Abdu'l-Baha distinguishes the materialistic and empirical        philosophy of the modern West from the standard rationalistic        philosophy of the Greeks and Persians, and highlights the difference        between theories of the essence of nature and of the origin of man."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19296"],[0,"Tablets of the Divine Plan (#4)"],[1,"of souls have reached the shore of the sea of faith!  Consider ye, what happiness, what joy is this! I declare by the Lord of  Hosts that had this respected daughter founded an empire, that empire  would not have been so great! For this sovereignty is eternal sovereignty  and this glory is everlasting glory.    10 Likewise, if some teachers go to other islands and other parts, such as  the continent of Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, also to Japan, Asiatic  Russia, Korea, French Indochina, Siam, Straits Settlements, India, Ceylon  and Afghanistan, most great results will be forthcoming. How good would it  be were there any possibility of a commission composed of men and women,  to travel together through China and Japan--so that this bond of love may  become strengthened, and through this going and coming they may establish  the oneness of the world of humanity, summon the people to the Kingdom of  God and spread the teachings.    11 Similarly, if possible, they should travel to the continent of Africa,  Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands, Madeira Islands, Reunion Islands, St.  Helena, Zanzibar, Mauritius, etc., and in those countries summon the  people to the Kingdom of God and raise the cry of \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha!\" They  must also upraise the flag of the oneness of the world of humanity in the  island of Madagascar.    12 Books and pamphlets must be either translated or composed in the  languages of these countries and islands, to be circulated in every part  and in all directions.    13 It is said that in South Africa, a diamond mine is discovered. Although  this mine is most valuable, yet after all it is stone. Perchance, God  willing, the mine of humanity may be discovered and the brilliant pearls  of the Kingdom be found.    14 In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the  hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the  longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of  men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most  wonderful state of receptivity is being realized. This is through the  consummate wisdom of God, so that capacity may be created, the standard of  the oneness of the world of humanity be upraised, and the fundamental of  universal peace and the divine principles be promoted in the East and the  West.    15 Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war  spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles,  France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium,  Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia,  Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Monaco,  San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta,  Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands.    16 In all these countries, like unto the morning stars shine ye forth from  the horizon of guidance. Thus far ye have been untiring in your labors.  Let your exertions henceforth increase a thousandfold. Summon the people  in these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter  the Abha Kingdom. The scope of your exertions must needs be extended. The  wider its range, the more striking will be the evidence of divine  assistance.    17 You have observed that while 'Abdu'l-Baha was in the utmost bodily  weakness and feebleness, while he was indisposed, and had not the power to  move--notwithstanding this physical state he traveled through many  countries, in Europe and America, and in churches, meetings and  conventions was occupied with the promotion of the divine principles and  summoned the people to the manifestation of the Kingdom of Abha. You have  also observed how the confirmations of the Blessed Perfection encompassed  all. What result is forthcoming from material rest, tranquillity, luxury  and attachment to this corporeal world? It is evident that the man who  pursues these things will in the end become afflicted with regret and  loss.    18 Consequently, one must close his eyes wholly to these thoughts, long  for eternal life, the sublimity of the world of humanity, the celestial  developments, the Holy Spirit, the promotion of the Word of God, the  guidance of the inhabitants of the globe, the promulgation of universal  peace and the proclamation of the oneness of the world of humanity! This  is the work! Otherwise like unto other animals and birds one must occupy  himself with the requirements of this physical life, the satisfaction of  which is the highest aspiration of the animal kingdom, and one must stalk  across the earth like unto the quadrupeds.    19 Consider ye! No matter how much man gains wealth, riches and opulence  in this world, he will not become as independent as a cow. For these  fattened cows roam freely over the vast tableland. All the prairies and  meadows are theirs for grazing, and all the springs and rivers are theirs  for drinking! No matter how much they graze, the fields will not be  exhausted! It is evident that they have earned these material bounties  with the utmost facility.    20 Still more ideal than this life is the life of the bird. A bird, on the  summit of a mountain, on the high, waving branches, has built for itself a  nest more beautiful than the palaces of the kings! The air is in the  utmost purity, the water cool and clear as crystal, the panorama charming  and enchanting. In such glorious surroundings, he expends his numbered  days. All the harvests of the plain are his possessions, having earned all  this wealth without the least labor. Hence, no matter how much man may  advance in this world, he shall not attain to the station of this bird!  Thus it becomes evident that in the matters of this world, however much  man may strive and work to the point of death, he will be unable to earn  the abundance, the freedom and the independent life of a small bird. This  proves and establishes the fact that man is not created for the life of  this ephemeral world--nay, rather, is he created for the acquirement of  infinite perfections, for the attainment to the sublimity of the world of  humanity, to be drawn nigh unto the divine threshold, and to sit on the  throne of everlasting sovereignty!    21 Upon you be Baha'u'l-Abha!    Whoever sets out on a teaching journey to any place, let him recite this  prayer day and night during his travels in foreign lands:    O GOD, my God! Thou seest me enraptured and attracted toward Thy glorious  kingdom, enkindled with the fire of Thy love amongst mankind, a herald of  Thy kingdom in these vast and spacious lands, severed from aught else save  Thee, relying on Thee, abandoning rest and comfort, remote from my native  home, a wanderer in these regions, a stranger fallen upon the ground,  humble before Thine exalted threshold, submissive toward the heaven of  Thine omnipotent glory, supplicating Thee in the dead of night and at the  break of dawn, entreating and invoking Thee at morn and at eventide to  graciously aid me to serve Thy Cause, to spread abroad Thy teachings and  to exalt Thy Word throughout the East and the West.    O Lord! Strengthen my back, enable me to serve Thee with the utmost  endeavor, and leave me not to myself, lonely and helpless in these  regions.    O Lord! Grant me communion with Thee in my loneliness, and be my companion  in these foreign lands.    Verily, Thou art the Confirmer of whomsoever Thou willest in that which  Thou desirest, and, verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.            8: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA      _Revealed on April 19, 1916, in 'Abdu'l-Baha's room at the house in Bahji;  on April 20, in the pilgrims' quarters of the house in Bahji; on April 22,  in the garden adjacent to the Shrine of Baha'u'llah, and addressed to the  Baha'is of the United States and Canada. _    1    _He is God!_  O ye Apostles of Baha'u'llah!  May my life be sacrificed for you!    2 The Blessed Person of the Promised One is interpreted in the Holy Book  as the Lord of Hosts--the heavenly armies. By heavenly armies those souls  are intended who are entirely freed from the human world, transformed into  celestial spirits and have become divine angels. Such souls are the rays  of the Sun of Reality who will illumine all the continents. Each one is  holding in his hand a trumpet, blowing the breath of life over all the  regions. They are delivered from human qualities and the defects of the  world of nature, are characterized with the characteristics of God, and  are attracted with the fragrances of the Merciful. Like unto the apostles  of Christ, who were filled with Him, these souls also have become filled  with His Holiness Baha'u'llah; that is, the love of Baha'u'llah has so  mastered every organ, part and limb of their bodies, as to leave no effect  from the promptings of the human world.    3 These souls are the armies of God and the conquerors of the East and the  West. Should one of them turn his face toward some direction and summon  the people to the Kingdom of God, all the ideal forces and lordly  confirmations will rush to his support and reinforcement. He will behold  all the doors open and all the strong fortifications and impregnable  castles razed to the ground. Singly and alone he will attack the armies of  the world, defeat the right and left wings of the hosts of all the  countries, break through the lines of the legions of all the nations and  carry his attack to the very center of the powers of the earth. This is  the meaning of the Hosts of God.    4 Any soul from among the believers of Baha'u'llah who attains to this  station will become known as the Apostle of Baha'u'llah. Therefore strive  ye with heart and soul so that ye may reach this lofty and exalted  position, be established on the throne of everlasting glory, and crown  your heads with the shining diadem of the Kingdom, whose brilliant jewels  may"]]]
