While he was gone the settlement became a prey to disease and famine.  Some were killed by the Indians while returning from their club at  evening; some became pirates.    The colony decreased from four hundred and ninety to sixty people, and  at last it was moved and seconded that they do now adjourn. They started  away from Jamestown without a tear, or hardly anything else, having  experienced a very dull time there, funerals being the only relaxation  whatever.    But moving down the bay they met Lord Delaware, the new Governor, with a  lot of Christmas-presents and groceries. Jamestown was once more saved,  though property still continued low. The company, by the terms of its  new charter, became a self-governing institution, and London was only  too tickled to get out of the responsibility. It is said that the only  genuine humor up to that time heard in London was spent on the jays of  Jamestown and the Virginia colony.    Where is that laughter now? Where are the gibes and _bon-mots_ made at  that sad time?    They are gone.    All over that little republic, so begun in sorrow and travail, there  came in after-years the dimples and the smiles of the prosperous child  who would one day rise in the lap of the mother-country, and, asserting  its rights by means of Patrick O'Fallen Henry and others, place a large  and disagreeable fire-cracker under the nose of royalty, that, busting  the awful stillness, should jar the empires of earth, and blow the  unblown noses of future kings and princes. (This is taken bodily from a  speech made by me July 4, 1777, when I was young.--THE AUTHOR.)    Pocahontas was married in 1613. She was baptized the day before. Whoever  thought of that was a bright and thoughtful thinker. She stood the wear  and tear of civilization for three years, and then died, leaving an  infant son, who has since grown up.    The colony now prospered. All freemen had the right to vote. Religious  toleration was enjoyed first-rate, and, there being no negro slavery,  Virginia bade fair to be _the_ republic of the continent. But in 1619  the captain of a Dutch trading-vessel sold to the colonists twenty  negroes. The negroes were mostly married people, and in some instances  children were born to them. This peculiarity still shows itself among  the negroes, and now all over the South one hardly crosses a county  without seeing a negro or a person with negro blood in his or her veins.    [Illustration: NEGROES STILL HAVE FAMILIES.]    After the death of Powhatan, the friend of the English, an organized  attempt was made by the Indians to exterminate the white people and  charge more for water frontage the next time any colonists came.    March 22, 1622, was the day set, and many of the Indians were eating at  the tables of those they had sworn to kill. It was a solemn moment. The  surprise was to take place between the cold beans and the chili sauce.    But a converted Indian told quite a number, and as the cold beans were  passed, the effect of some arsenic that had been eaten with the  slim-neck clams began to be seen, and before the beans had gone half-way  round the board the children of the forest were seen to excuse  themselves, and thus avoid dying in the house.    [Illustration: PREPARING THE FEAST.]    Yet there were over three hundred and fifty white people massacred, and  there followed another, reducing the colonists from four thousand to two  thousand five hundred, then a massacre of five hundred, and so on, a  sickening record of death and horror, even worse, before a great nation  could get a foothold in this wild and savage land; even a toe-hold, as I  may say, in the sands of time.    July 30, 1619, the first sprout of Freedom poked its head from the soil  of Jamestown when Governor Yeardley stated that the colony \"should have  a handle in governing itself.\" He then called at Jamestown the first  legislative body ever assembled in America; most of the members whereof  boarded at the Planters' House during the session. (For sample of  legislator see picture.) This body could pass laws, but they must be  ratified by the company in England. The orders from London were not  binding unless ratified by this Colonial Assembly.    This was a mutual arrangement reminding one of the fearful yet mutual  apprehension spoken of by the poet when he says,--      \"Jim Darling didn't know but his father was dead,    And his father didn't know but Jim Darling was dead.\"    The colony now began to prosper; men held their lands in severalty, and  taxes were low. The railroad had not then brought in new styles in  clothing and made people unhappy by creating jealousy.    Settlements joined each other along the James for one hundred and forty  miles, and the colonists first demonstrated how easily they could get  along without the New York papers.    Tobacco began to be a very valuable crop, and at one time even the  streets were used for its cultivation. Tobacco now proceeded to become  a curse to the civilized world.    In 1624, King James, fearing that the infant colony would go Democratic,  appointed a rump governor.    The oppression of the English parliament now began to be felt. The  colonists were obliged to ship their products to England and to use only  English vessels. The Assembly, largely royalists, refused to go out when  their terms of office expired, paid themselves at the rate of about  thirty-six dollars per day as money is now, and, in fact, acted like  members of the Legislature generally.    [Illustration: JAMESTOWN LEGISLATOR.]    In 1676, one hundred years before the Colonies declared themselves free  and independent, a rebellion, under the management of a bright young  attorney named Bacon, visited Jamestown and burned the American  metropolis, after which Governor Berkeley was driven out. Bacon died  just as his rebellion was beginning to pay, and the people dispersed.  Berkeley then took control, and killed so many rebels that Mrs. Berkeley  had to do her own work, and Berkeley, who had no one left to help him  but his friends, had to stack his own grain that fall and do the chores  at the barn.    Jamestown is now no more. It was succeeded in 1885 by Jamestown, North  Dakota, now called Jimtown, a prosperous place in the rich farming-lands  of that State.    Jamestown the first, the scene of so many sorrows and little jealousies,  so many midnight Indian attacks and bilious attacks by day, became a  solemn ruin, and a few shattered tombstones, over which the jimson-weed  and the wild vines clamber, show to the curious traveller the place  where civilization first sought to establish itself on the James River,  U.S.A.           *       *       *       *       *         The author wishes to refer with great gratitude to information       contained in the foregoing chapter and obtained from the following       works:         The Indian and other Animalcula.

In the fall of 1620 the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth during a  disagreeable storm, and, noting the excellent opportunity for future  misery, began to erect a number of rude cabins. This party consisted of  one hundred and two people of a resolute character who wished to worship  God in a more extemporaneous manner than had been the custom in the  Church of England.    They found that the Indians of Cape Cod were not ritualistic, and that  they were willing to dispose of inside lots at Plymouth on reasonable  terms, retaining, however, the right to use the lands for massacre  purposes from time to time.    The Pilgrims were honest, and gave the Indians something for their land  in almost every instance, but they put a price upon it which has made  the Indian ever since a comparatively poor man.    Half of this devoted band died before spring, and yet the idea of  returning to England did not occur to them. \"No,\" they exclaimed, \"we  will not go back to London until we can go first-class, if we have to  stay here two hundred years.\"    During the winter they discovered why the lands had been sold to them so  low. The Indians of one tribe had died there of a pestilence the year  before, and so when the Pilgrims began to talk trade they did not haggle  over prices.    In the early spring, however, they were surprised to hear the word  \"Welcome\" proceeding from the door-mat of Samoset, an Indian whose chief  was named Massasoit. A treaty was then made for fifty years, Massasoit  taking \"the same.\"    Canonicus once sent to Governor Bradford a bundle of arrows tied up in a  rattlesnake's skin. The Governor put them away in the pantry with his  other curios, and sent Canonicus a few bright new bullets and a little  dose of powder. That closed the correspondence. In those days there were  no newspapers, and most of the fighting was done without a guarantee or  side bets.    Money-matters; however, were rather panicky at the time, and the people  were kept busy digging clams to sustain life in order to raise Indian  corn enough to give them sufficient strength to pull clams enough the  following winter to get them through till the next corn crop should give  them strength to dig for clams again. Thus a trip to London and the Isle  of Wight looked farther and farther away.    After four years they numbered only one hundred and eighty-four,  counting immigration and all. The colony only needed, however, more  people and Eastern capital.    It would be well"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#4)"],[1,"of  another; the Brahman could not enter a lower order; if he violated  the laws of his own grade, he became an outcast, lost to all but  outcasts like himself.\"    At this point, the imagination of the Greek, flashing forward  upon all the consequences of such a degradation, overcame his  eager attention, and he exclaimed, \"In such a state, O brethren,  what mighty need of a loving God!\"    \"Yes,\" added the Egyptian, \"of a loving God like ours.\"    The brows of the Hindoo knit painfully; when the emotion was spent,  he proceeded, in a softened voice.    \"I was born a Brahman. My life, consequently, was ordered down to  its least act, its last hour. My first draught of nourishment;  the giving me my compound name; taking me out the first time to  see the sun; investing me with the triple thread by which I became  one of the twice-born; my induction into the first order--were all  celebrated with sacred texts and rigid ceremonies. I might not walk,  eat, drink, or sleep without danger of violating a rule. And the  penalty, O brethren, the penalty was to my soul! According to the  degrees of omission, my soul went to one of the heavens--Indra's the  lowest, Brahma's the highest; or it was driven back to become the  life of a worm, a fly, a fish, or a brute. The reward for perfect  observance was Beatitude, or absorption into the being of Brahm,  which was not existence as much as absolute rest.\"    The Hindoo gave himself a moment's thought; proceeding, he said:  \"The part of a Brahman's life called the first order is his student  life. When I was ready to enter the second order--that is to say,  when I was ready to marry and become a householder--I questioned  everything, even Brahm; I was a heretic. From the depths of the well  I had discovered a light above, and yearned to go up and see what  all it shone upon. At last--ah, with what years of toil!--I stood  in the perfect day, and beheld the principle of life, the element  of religion, the link between the soul and God--Love!\"    The shrunken face of the good man kindled visibly, and he clasped  his hands with force. A silence ensued, during which the others  looked at him, the Greek through tears. At length he resumed:    \"The happiness of love is in action; its test is what one is  willing to do for others. I could not rest. Brahm had filled  the world with so much wretchedness. The Sudra appealed to me,  so did the countless devotees and victims. The island of Ganga  Lagor lies where the sacred waters of the Ganges disappear in  the Indian Ocean. Thither I betook myself. In the shade of the  temple built there to the sage Kapila, in a union of prayers  with the disciples whom the sanctified memory of the holy man  keeps around his house, I thought to find rest. But twice every  year came pilgrimages of Hindoos seeking the purification of the  waters. Their misery strengthened my love. Against its impulse to  speak I clenched my jaws; for one word against Brahm or the Triad  or the Shastras would doom me; one act of kindness to the outcast  Brahmans who now and then dragged themselves to die on the burning  sands--a blessing said, a cup of water given--and I became one of them,  lost to family, country, privileges, caste. The love conquered! I  spoke to the disciples in the temple; they drove me out. I spoke  to the pilgrims; they stoned me from the island. On the highways  I attempted to preach; my hearers fled from me, or sought my life.  In all India, finally, there was not a place in which I could find  peace or safety--not even among the outcasts, for, though fallen,  they were still believers in Brahm. In my extremity, I looked for  a solitude in which to hide from all but God. I followed the Ganges  to its source, far up in the Himalayas. When I entered the pass at  Hurdwar, where the river, in unstained purity, leaps to its course  through the muddy lowlands, I prayed for my race, and thought myself  lost to them forever. Through gorges, over cliffs, across glaciers,  by peaks that seemed star-high, I made my way to the Lang Tso, a  lake of marvellous beauty, asleep at the feet of the Tise Gangri,  the Gurla, and the Kailas Parbot, giants which flaunt their crowns  of snow everlastingly in the face of the sun. There, in the centre  of the earth, where the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmapootra rise to run  their different courses; where mankind took up their first abode,  and separated to replete the world, leaving Balk, the mother of  cities, to attest the great fact; where Nature, gone back to its  primeval condition, and secure in its immensities, invites the sage  and the exile, with promise of safety to the one and solitude to  the other--there I went to abide alone with God, praying, fasting,  waiting for death.\"    Again the voice fell, and the bony hands met in a fervent clasp.    \"One night I walked by the shores of the lake, and spoke to the  listening silence, 'When will God come and claim his own? Is there  to be no redemption?' Suddenly a light began to glow tremulously  out on the water; soon a star arose, and moved towards me,  and stood overhead. The brightness stunned me. While I lay upon  the ground, I heard a voice of infinite sweetness say, 'Thy love  hath conquered. Blessed art thou, O son of India! The redemption  is at hand. With two others, from far quarters of the earth,  thou shalt see the Redeemer, and be a witness that he hath come.  In the morning arise, and go meet them; and put all thy trust in  the Spirit which shall guide thee.'    \"And from that time the light has stayed with me; so I knew it  was the visible presence of the Spirit. In the morning I started  to the world by the way I had come. In a cleft of the mountain I  found a stone of vast worth, which I sold in Hurdwar. By Lahore,  and Cabool, and Yezd, I came to Ispahan. There I bought the  camel, and thence was led to Bagdad, not waiting for caravans.  Alone I traveled, fearless, for the Spirit was with me, and is  with me yet. What glory is ours, O brethren! We are to see the  Redeemer--to speak to him--to worship him! I am done.\"          CHAPTER V      The vivacious Greek broke forth in expressions of joy and  congratulations; after which the Egyptian said, with characteristic  gravity:    \"I salute you, my brother. You have suffered much, and I rejoice  in your triumph. If you are both pleased to hear me, I will now  tell you who I am, and how I came to be called. Wait for me a  moment.\"    He went out and tended the camels; coming back, he resumed his seat.    \"Your words, brethren, were of the Spirit,\" he said, in commencement;  \"and the Spirit gives me to understand them. You each spoke particularly  of your countries; in that there was a great object, which I will explain;  but to make the interpretation complete, let me first speak of myself and  my people. I am Balthasar the Egyptian.\"    The last words were spoken quietly, but with so much dignity that  both listeners bowed to the speaker.    \"There are many distinctions I might claim for my race,\" he continued;  \"but I will content myself with one. History began with us. We were the  first to perpetuate events by records kept. So we have no traditions;  and instead of poetry, we offer you certainty. On the facades of  palaces and temples, on obelisks, on the inner walls of tombs,  we wrote the names of our kings, and what they did; and to the  delicate papyri we intrusted the wisdom of our philosophers and  the secrets of our religion--all the secrets but one, whereof I  will presently speak. Older than the Vedas of Para-Brahm or the  Up-Angas of Vyasa, O Melchior; older than the songs of Homer or  the metaphysics of Plato, O my Gaspar; older than the sacred  books or kings of the people of China, or those of Siddartha,  son of the beautiful Maya; older than the Genesis of Mosche the  Hebrew--oldest of human records are the writings of Menes, our  first king.\" Pausing an instant, he fixed his large eves kindly  upon the Greek, saying, \"In the youth of Hellas, who, O Gaspar,  were the teachers of her teachers?\"    The Greek bowed, smiling.    \"By those records,\" Balthasar continued, \"we know that when the  fathers came from the far East, from the region of the birth of the  three sacred rivers, from the centre of the earth--the Old Iran of  which you spoke, O Melchior--came bringing with them the history  of the world before the Flood, and of the Flood itself, as given  to the Aryans by the sons of Noah, they taught God, the Creator  and the Beginning, and the Soul, deathless as God. When the duty  which calls us now is happily done, if you choose to go with me,  I will show you the sacred library of our priesthood; among others,  the Book of the Dead, in which is the ritual to be observed by the  soul after Death has despatched it on its journey to judgment.  The ideas--God and the Immortal Soul--were borne to Mizraim over  the desert, and by him to the banks of the Nile. They were then  in their purity, easy of understanding, as what God intends for  our happiness always is; so, also, was the first worship--a song  and a prayer natural to a soul joyous, hopeful, and in love with  its Maker.\"    Here the Greek threw up his hands, exclaiming, \"Oh! the light  deepens within me!\"    \"And in me!\" said the Hindoo, with equal fervor.    The Egyptian regarded them benignantly, then went on, saying,  \"Religion is merely the law which binds man to his Creator:  in purity it has but these elements--God, the Soul, and their  Mutual Recognition; out of which, when put in practise,  spring Worship, Love, and Reward. This law, like all others of  divine origin--like that, for instance, which binds the earth  to the sun--was perfected in the beginning by its Author. Such,  my brothers, was the religion of the first family; such was the  religion of our father Mizraim, who could not have been blind to  the formula of creation, nowhere so discernible as in the first  faith and the earliest worship. Perfection is "]]]
