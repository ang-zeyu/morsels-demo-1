Suddenly, from a hillock of the moor, Florian beheld afar the enchanted  dwelling. A great sunken marsh lay before him, beginning at the foot of  the little hill and stretching away, league after league, till its  farther shore was hidden in the gathering darkness. The autumn wind  stirred the dead sedges at its brim, and though the dying twilight was  still gleaming in the sky, the great bog had caught little of its glow,  and lay full of coiling blue mists, pale quagmires, and islands of  mysterious darkness. A dreadful moaning cry, uttered by some demon of  the moor, sounded through the mist, chilling the blood in Florian's  veins; and as if in answer to the cry, thousands upon thousands of  will-o'-the-wisps appeared, darting and dancing. In the very heart of this  terrible marsh a great black rock uprose, and on this rock, its turrets  and battlements outlined against the burning face of the moon, stood the  castle. Ghostly lights, now green, now blue, flickered in its windows.    The Enchanter reined up his horse at the brink of the mire, and cried,--      \"List! List!    Will-o'-the-Wisp,    Lend me your light.\"    Scarcely had the last word fallen from the Enchanter's mouth, when the  dancing witch-fires hurried toward him from all sides of the marsh. Soon  a pale road leading across the bog to the castle stood revealed, an  enchanted road which melted away behind the riders as smoke melts into  the winter air. To the very gates of his castle did the ghost-fires  accompany the Enchanter; then, rising swiftly high into the air, they  fled like startled birds, in every direction.    Doors opened of their own will, strange goblins and ghostly creatures  passed, and bright, whirling globes of fire fled hissing across the  castle courtyard. Just as they were about to enter the castle itself,  the Enchanter turned, and fastened his burning eyes on Florian.    \"Boy,\" said he, \"let nothing that you hear or see make you afraid. Be  assured that no power or spirit can harm you. There is only one demon in  the world whose power is greater than mine, and that is Fear himself. Be  brave, keep the doors of your heart locked against Fear; be faithful,  and you shall never have cause to regret your coming.\"    So Florian, who was by nature brave, felt ashamed of having allowed the  demon Fear to knock at the door of his heart, and resolved never to let  his courage fail, no matter what might happen. And true to this resolve  the lad remained during the years he spent in the service of the  Enchanter. At first, to be sure, he had to struggle to conquer his fear  of some of the goblins; but as time passed and no ghost or goblin ever  ventured to annoy him, he grew accustomed to their presences and ended  by paying no more attention to them than he paid to the great ravens who  flew croaking over the mire. So faithful and courageous was the little  page that, when his year was up, the Enchanter begged him to remain yet  another year, promising him rich rewards if he stayed. When this second  year was up, however, Florian felt a longing to see the world again, and  told the Enchanter that he must be going.    \"Very well,\" said the Enchanter, who respected the courage of the brave  page, \"thou shalt do as thou desirest. Thou art a brave and faithful  lad. Here is a purse of gold for thy wages, and here are three gifts to  reward thy courage and good-will.\" He opened a copper casket and took  forth a little golden bird with outstretched wings hanging from a fine  golden chain, a golden key, and a scarlet sphere marked with a band of  white. \"This little bird,\" continued the Enchanter, \"will protect you  from the spells of any sorcerer whose power is less than mine, and will  sing when you fare into hidden danger; this key will open every door in  the world; and should you ever lose your way, you have but to put this  sphere on the ground, and it will roll home of its own accord. Moreover,  if you are ever yourself in deadly peril, call upon me, and I will come  and help you.\"    So Florian thanked the Enchanter, and taking his gifts, went back into  the world again. But so gentle and kind was he that he soon gave away to  the unfortunate all the gold he had earned, and was forced to go in  search of another situation. At length he entered the service of the  King and Queen of the Twelve Towers.    This royal couple, who were renowned in Fairyland as much for their  goodness and generosity as for their wealth and magnificence, had but  one son, Prince Florizel. No braver or more gallant prince ever drew  breath. He had driven the dragon of the blue cavern out of his father's  kingdom; he had fought three wicked ogres one after the other, and  finished each one; he had delivered the diamond castle of a terrible  spell which lay upon it.    When Florian entered the service of the King and Queen, these excellent  parents were sending their son on a visit to his uncle, the Emperor of  the Plain, and Florian was ordered to join the gay company of lords and  ladies, knights and soldiers, who were to make the journey. According to  the gossip of the company, Prince Florizel was being sent to his uncle's  in the hope that he would fall in love with his uncle's ward, the  beautiful Princess Rosamond.    Now in some way or other, after the company had been a few days on the  road, Prince Florizel, who watched over the company as carefully as a  good captain does over his soldiers, became aware of the bravery,  trustworthiness, and modest bearing of Florian, the little page, and  promoted him to be his own personal squire. Alas! no sooner had he been  advanced, than Florian the little page, though remaining outwardly a  page, became at heart the runaway girl, Isabella. Though she fought as  hard as she could against her own heart, it was of little use, and she  knew herself to be deeply in love with the gallant Florizel. Yet she  suffered no word or sign of her affection to escape her, for Prince  Florizel thought her only a little page, and to speak would be to betray  the secret she had so long and successfully guarded.    One morning, as the cavalcade was riding through a charming country,  Florian, for so we must still continue to call Isabella, was following  close behind his master, when the Prince caught sight of a wonderful  scarlet flower, something like a scarlet lily, blooming by the roadside.  At the same moment, the little golden bird that Florian wore round his  neck sang a few clear notes as if it were alive.    \"What a pretty flower!\" said the Prince. \"I must have it.\"    And he was about to dismount and pick the flower, when Florian spurred  on ahead of him, grasped the enchanted flower, and tossed it into a  ditch.    \"Fie, what a naughty page!\" cried the lords and ladies.    The company rode on a few miles more, and suddenly the Prince caught  sight of a beautiful jeweled dagger lying in the highway. At the same  moment the little golden bird sang a few clear notes of warning.    \"What a fine dagger!\" cried the Prince, \"I must have it.\"    And he was about to dismount and pick up the dagger, when Florian  spurred on ahead of him, seized the dagger, and tossed it into a ditch.    \"Fie, what a naughty page!\" cried the lords and ladies.    The company now rode on for a few miles more, and the Prince saw by the  roadside a beautiful enchanted garden. Birds of many colors sang in the  branches of the trees, fountains sparkled and danced in the sunlight,  and the sweetest of music was heard. At the same moment the golden bird  sang louder and longer than ever.    \"What a beautiful garden!\" cried the Prince. \"Let us ride in and look  about.\"    So Florian hurried to the Prince's side, and implored him not to enter,  saying that the garden was enchanted and that some harm would certainly  befall him.    At this, all the lords and ladies, who were a little jealous, perhaps,  that a page should know more than they, laughed at poor Florian, and  even Florizel smiled at him and said, \"All that is only fancy, little  Florian,\" and dashed in through the garden gate. For a minute or so  nothing happened, and the first to enter mocked at Florian again; but  when the whole company had entered the garden, there was a clap of  thunder, and everybody except the Prince and Florian, who was protected  by the Enchanter's charm, was turned into stone. The echoes of the  thunder had hardly ceased rolling when two frightful demons with lions'  heads rushed towards them through the garden, seized the Prince, and  hurried him away. Florian was left alone in the garden. Night was fast  approaching.    Now, the owner of the enchanted garden was a witch, who had a daughter  so frightfully ugly that even her mother's powerful magic could not make  her beautiful. In spite of her ugliness, however, the witch's daughter  considered herself quite beautiful, and was always importuning her  mother to invite to the castle princes whom she considered worthy of her  hand. So the old witch gave wonderful dances and parties, to which all  the eligible young kings and princes of the neighborhood were invited;  but just as soon as the witch's daughter appeared with a horrid smirk on  her ugly face, the young men were sure to make their excuses and ride  away.    At length the old witch, who had just had a severe tongue-lashing from  her daughter for not punishing the Prince of Zagabondiga after that  prince had failed to ask her for a dance, could endure her daughter's  scolding no longer, and resolved to catch the first prince who came past  her garden, and force him, willy nilly, to accept her ugly daughter.  Into her trap poor Florizel had walked, and the witch, hoping to bend  him to her will by terrifying him, had thrown him into a deep dungeon.  The ugly daughter had immediately peeked through the key-hole of the  prison, and fallen in love"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19209"],[0,"The Andes and the Amazon; Or, Across the Continent of South America (#4)"],[1,"is the _cacao de  abajo_, from down the river, as Machala, Santa Rosa, Balao, and Manabi,  below Guayaquil. A still richer nut is the mountain cacao, but it is  never cultivated. It is small and white, and almost pure oil. This oil,  called cacao-butter, is used by the natives for burns, sores, and many  cutaneous diseases. Cacao contributes more to the commerce of the  republic than any other production of its soil. The flowers and fruit  grow directly out of the trunk and branches. \"A more striking example  (says Humboldt) of the expansive powers of life could hardly be met with  in organic nature.\" The fruit is yellowish-red, and of oblong shape, and  the seeds (from which chocolate is prepared) are enveloped in a mass of  white pulp. The tree resembles our lilac in size and shape, and yields  three crops a year--in March, June, and September. Spain is the largest  consumer of cacao. The Mexican _chocolalt_ is the origin of our word  chocolate. Tucker gives the following comparative analysis of unshelled  beans from Guayaquil and Caracas:                         Guayaquil.

Each tree yields on an average two pounds annually.    The other chief articles of exportation are hides, cotton, \"Panama  hats,\" manufactured at Indian villages on the coast, cinchona bark,  caucho, tobacco, orchilla weed, sarsaparilla, and tamarinds.[8] The hats  are usually made of the \"Toquilla\" (_Carludovica palmata_), an  arborescent plant about five feet high, resembling the palm. The leaf,  which is a yard long, is plaited like a fan, and is borne on a  three-cornered stalk. It is cut while young, the stiff parallel veins  removed, then slit into shreds by whipping it, and immersed in boiling  water, and finally bleached in the sun. The same \"straw\" is used in the  interior. The \"Mocora,\" which grows like a cocoa-nut tree, with a very  smooth, hard, thorny bark, is rarely used, as it is difficult to work.  The leaves are from eight to twelve feet in length, so that the \"straws\"  will finish a hat without splicing. Such hats require two or three  months, and bring sometimes $150; but they will last a lifetime. They  can be packed away in a vest pocket, and they can be turned inside out  and worn, the inside surface being as smooth and well finished as the  outside. \"Toquilla\" hats are whiter than the \"mocora.\"    [Footnote 8: In 1867 there were exported to Europe of cacao, 197,260  quintals; cotton, 10,247 do.; caucho, 8911 do.; sarsaparilla, 149 do.;  orchilla, 10,247 packages; quinine, 5000 do.; tobacco, 2000 do.; coffee,  1611 do.; tamarinds, 65 bbls.; sides of leather, 22,514; hats, 8397.]    The exports from Guayaquil bear no proportion to the capabilities of the  country; Ecuador has no excuse for being bankrupt. Most of the imports  are of English origin; lard comes from the United States, and flour from  Chile.    The Malecon and river present a lively scene all the year round; the  rest of the city appears deserted in comparison. The British steamers  from Panama and Payta arrive weekly; Yankee steam-boats make regular  trips up and down the Guayas and its tributaries; half a dozen sailing  vessels, principally French, are usually lying in the stream, which is  here six fathoms deep; and hundreds of canoes are gliding to and fro.  But the _balsas_ are the most original, and, therefore, the most  attractive sight. These are rafts made of light balsa wood, so buoyant  as to be used in coasting voyages. They were invented by the old  Peruvians, and are the homes of a literally floating population. By  these and the smaller craft are brought to the mole of the Malecon,  besides articles for exportation, a boundless variety of  fruits--pine-apples (whose quality has made Guayaquil famous), oranges,  lemons, limes, plantains, bananas, cocoa-nuts, alligator pears, papayas,  mangos, guavas, melons, etc.; many an undescribed species of fish known  only to the epicure, and barrels or jars of water from a distant point  up the river, out of the reach of the tide and the city sewers. Ice is  frequently brought from Chimborazo, and sold for $1 per pound. A flag  hoisted at a favorite cafe announces that snow has arrived from the  mountains, and that ice-cream can be had. The market, held every morning  by the river side, is an animated scene. The strife of the half-naked  fishmongers, the cry of the swarthy fruit-dealers--\"Pinas!\" \"Naranjas!\"  etc., and the song of the itinerant dulce-peddler--\"Tamales!\" mingled  with the bray of the water-bearing donkeys as they trot through the  town, never fail to arrest the attention of every traveler.    But there is another sight more attractive still--one worth a long  voyage, for Nature nowhere else repeats the picture. From the balconies  of Guayaquil can be seen on a clear day the long, towering range of the  Andes. We may forget all the incidents in our subsequent journey, but  the impression produced by that glorious view is unfading. The sun had  nearly touched the Pacific when the clouds, which for days had wrapped  the Cordilleras[9] in misty robes, suddenly rose like a curtain. There  stood, in inconceivable grandeur, one of the stupendous products of the  last great revolution of the earth's crust, as a geologist would say,  but, in the language of history, the lofty home of the Incas, made  illustrious by the sword of Pizarro and the pen of Prescott. On the  right a sea of hills rose higher and higher, till they culminated in the  purple mountains of Assuay. Far to the left, one hundred miles  northeasterly, the peerless Chimborazo lifted its untrodden and  unapproachable summit above its fellows--an imposing background to  lesser mountains and stately forests. The great dome reflected  dazzlingly the last blushes of the west, its crown of snow fringed with  black lines, which were the steep and sharp edges of precipitous rocks.  It was interesting to watch the mellowing tints on the summit as the  shadows crept upward: gold, vermilion, violet, purple, were followed by  a momentary \"glory;\" then darkness covered the earth, and a host of  stars, \"trembling with excess of light,\" burst suddenly into view over  the peaks of the Andes.    [Footnote 9: _Cordillera_ (pronounced Cor-de-yer-ra), literally a long  ridge, is usually applied to a longitudinal subdivision of the Andes, as  the east and west cordilleras inclosing the valley of Quito; _Sierra_  (from the Spanish for saw or Arabic _sehrah_, an uncultivated tract) is  a jagged spur of the Andes; _Cerro_, \"a hog-backed hill.\" _Paramo_ (a  desert) is the treeless, uninhabited, uncultivated rolling steppes just  below the snow-limit.]    Bidding \"adios\" to our Guayaquilian friends, we took passage in one of  Captain Lee's little steamers to Bodegas, seventy miles up the river.  The Ecuadorian government, strange to say, does not patronize these  steamers, but carries the Quito mail in a canoe. The Guayas is a  sluggish stream, its turbid waters starting from the slope of the  Andes, and flowing through a low, level tract, covered with varied forms  of vegetable life. Forests of the broad-leaved plantain and banana line  the banks. The fruit is the most common article of food in equatorial  America, and is eaten raw, roasted, baked, boiled, and fried. It grows  on a succulent stem formed of sheath-like leaf-stalks rolled over one  another, and terminating in enormous light green, glossy blades nearly  ten feet long by two feet wide, so delicate that the slightest wind will  tear them transversely. Each tree (vulgarly called \"the tree of  paradise\") produces fruit but once, and then dies. A single bunch often  weighs 60 or 70 pounds; and Humboldt calculated that 33 pounds of wheat  and 99 pounds of potatoes require the same space of ground as will  produce 4000 pounds of bananas. They really save more labor than steam,  giving the greatest amount of food from a given piece of ground with the  least labor. They are always found where the palm is; but their original  home is the foot of the Himalayas. The banana (by some botanists  considered a different species from the plantain) is about four inches  long, and cylindrical, and is eaten raw. The plantain is twice as large  and prismatic, and uncooked is unhealthy. There is another variety,  _platanos de Otaheite_, which resembles the banana in size and quality,  but is prismatic.    A belt of jungle and impenetrable brushwood intervenes, and then cacao  and coffee plantations, vast in extent, arrest the eye. Passing these,  the steamer brings you alongside of broad fields covered with the low,  prickly pine-apple plant; the air is fragrant with a rich perfume wafted  from a neighboring grove of oranges and lemons; the mango spreads its  dense, splendid foliage, and bears a golden fruit, which, though praised  by many, tastes to us like a mixture of tow and turpentine; the exotic  bread-tree waves its fig-like leaves and pendent fruit; while high over  all the beautiful cocoa-palm lifts its crown of glory.[10] Animal life  does not compare with this luxuriant growth. The steamer-bound traveler  may see a few monkeys, a group of _gallinazos_, and many brilliant,  though songless birds; but the chief representative is the lazy, ugly  alligator. Large numbers of these monsters may be seen on the mud-b"]]]
