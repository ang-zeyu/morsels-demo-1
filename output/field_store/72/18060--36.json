And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,  When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.    Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,  As he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place.  I gave him a cup, and he smiled--'twas only a boy, you see;  Faint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he'd sailed on the Tennessee.    Only sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother's only son--  Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun!  The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth;  And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South.    Oh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through and through;  Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't do;--  The boy was dying, sir, dying as plain as plain could be,  Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.    But when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,  Water came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth.  \"Do you know the Blue-Grass country?\" he wistful began to say;  Then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away.    I had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to;  I fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother'd do;  And when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,  Morgan's men--were miles; away, galloping, galloping on.    \"Oh, I must go,\" he muttered; \"I must be up and away!  Morgan--Morgan is waiting for me; Oh, what will Morgan say?\"  But I heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door--  The ringing sound of horses' hoofs that I had heard before.    And on, on, came the soldiers--the Michigan cavalry--  And fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping rapidly,--  They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had followed day and night;  But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight.    And rich Ohio sat startled through all those summer days;  For strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways--  Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west,  Through river-valleys and cornland farms, sweeping away her best.    A bold ride and a long ride; but they were taken at last.  They almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;  But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford,  And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword.    Well, I kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will--  But he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still.  When it was cool and dusky--you'll wonder to hear me tell--  But I stole down to that gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle.    I kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty gentle lass--  But I knew that she'd be happy back in the old Blue-Grass.  A suit of clothes of Conrad's, with all the money I had,  And Kentuck, pretty Kentuck, I gave to the worn-out lad.    I guided him to the southward as well as I know how;  The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;  And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell,  As down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!    When Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high;  Baby and I were both crying--I couldn't tell him why--  But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,  And a thin old horse, with drooping head, stood in Kentucky's stall.    Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me;  He knew I couldn't help it--'twas all for the Tennessee,  But, after the war was over, just think what came to pass--  A letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass.    The lad had got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;  And Kentuck, she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;  He cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur.  Ah! we've had many horses since, but never a horse like her!        _Constance F. Woolson._          An Inventor's Wife      I remember it all so very well, the first of my married life,    That I can't believe it was years ago--it doesn't seem true at all;  Why, I just can see the little church where they made us man and wife,    And the merry glow of the first wood-fire that danced on our cottage            wall.    _We were happy?_ Yes; and we prospered, too; the house belonged            to Joe,    And then, he worked in the planing mill, and drew the best of pay;  And our cup was full when Joey came,--our baby-boy, you know;    So, all went well till that mill burned down and the owner moved away.    It wasn't long till Joe found work, but 'twas never quite the same,--    Never steady, with smaller pay; so to make the two ends meet  He fell to inventin' some machine--I don't recall the name,    But he'd sit for hours in his little shop that opens toward the            street,--    Sit for hours, bent over his work, his tools all strewn about.    I used to want to go in there to dust and sweep the floor,  But 'twas just as if 'twas the parson there, writing his sermon out;    Even the baby--bless the child!--learned never to slam that door!    People called him a clever man, and folks from the city came    To look at his new invention and wish my Joe success;  And Joe would say, \"Little woman,\"--for that was my old pet-name,--    \"If my plan succeeds, you shall have a coach and pair, and a fine silk            dress!\"    I didn't want 'em, the grand new things, but it made the big tears start    To see my Joe with his restless eyes, his fingers worn away  To the skin and bone, for he wouldn't eat; and it almost broke my heart    When he tossed at night from side to side, till the dawning of the day.    Of course, with it all he lost his place. I couldn't blame the man,    The foreman there at the factory, for losing faith in Joe,  For his mind was never upon his work, but on some invention-plan,    As with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro.    Yet, he kept on workin' at various things, till our little money went    For wheels and screws and metal casts and things I had never seen;  And I ceased to ask, \"Any pay, my dear?\" with the answer, \"Not a cent!\"    When his lock and his patent-saw had failed, he clung to that great            machine.    I remember one special thing that year. He had bought some costly tool,    When we wanted our boy to learn to read--he was five years old, you            know;  He went to his class with cold, bare feet, till at last he came from            school    And gravely said, \"Don't send me back; the children tease me so!\"    I hadn't the heart to cross the child, so, while I sat and sewed    He would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side;  And when the struggle was hardest and I felt keen hunger's goad    Driving me almost to despair--the little baby died.    Her father came to the cradle-side, as she lay, so small and white;    \"Maggie,\" he said, \"I have killed this child, and now I am killing you!  I swear by heaven, I will give it up!\" Yet, like a thief, that night    He stole to the shop and worked; his brow all wet with a clammy dew.    I cannot tell how I lived that week, my little boy and I,    Too proud to beg; too weak to work; and the weather cold and wild.  I can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky,    And the wind went wailing round the house, like the ghost of my buried            child.    Joe still toiled in the little shop. Somebody clicked the gate;    A neighbor-lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor,  But I sat half-stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate,    Till I heard--the crack of a pistol-shot; and I sprang to the workshop            door.    That door was locked and the bolt shut fast. I could not cry, nor speak,    But I snatched my boy from the corner there, sick with a sudden dread,  And carried him out through the garden plot, forgetting my arms were weak,    Forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head;    The front door yielded to my touch. I staggered faintly in,    Fearing--_what_? He stood unharmed, though the wall showed a            jagged hole.  In his trembling hand, his aim had failed, and the great and deadly sin    Of his own life's blood was not yet laid on the poor man's tortured soul.    But the pistol held another charge, I knew; and like something mad    I shook my fist in my poor man's face, and shrieked at him, fierce and            wild,  \"How can you dare to rob us so?\"--and I seized the little lad;    \"How can you dare to rob your wife and your little helpless child?\"    All of a sudden, he bowed his head, while from his nerveless hand    That hung so limp, I almost feared to see the pistol fall.  \"Maggie,\" he said in a low, low voice, \"you see me as I stand    A hopeless man. My plan has failed. That letter tells you all.\"    Then for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death;    Only the drip of the rain outside, for the storm was almost o'er;  But no;--there followed another sound, and I started, caught my breath;    As a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door.    I shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise;    He must have guessed our awful state; he couldn't help but see  There was something wrong; but never a word, never a look in his eyes    Told what he thought, as in kindly way he talked to Joe and me.    He was come from a thriving city firm, and they'd sent him here to say    That _one_ of Joe's inventions was a great, successful thing;  And which do you think? His window-catch that he'd tinkered up one day;    And we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring.    And then the pleasant stranger went, and we wakened as from a dream.    My man bent down his head and said, \"Little woman, you've saved my life!\"  The worn look gone from his dear gray eyes, and in its place, a gleam    From the sun that has shone so brightly since, on Joe and his happy            wife!        _Jeannie Pendleton Ewing._      "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18910"],[0,"Diary of a Nursing Sister on the Western Front, 1914-1915 (#4)"],[1,". There is a Proclamation up all over  the town telling the people to pull themselves together whatever  happens, and to forget everything that is not La Patrie. Also another  about the military necessity for the Government to leave Paris, and  that they mustn't be afraid of anything that may happen, because we  shall win in the end, &c., &c.    We don't start till to-morrow, I believe; meanwhile, cleanliness and  privacy and sheets, and cool, quick meals and sea breeze, are cheering  after the grime and the pigging and the squash and the awful heat of the  last fortnight. I have picked up a bad cold from the foul dust-heaps and  drainless condition of the smelly Havre streets, but it will soon  disappear now.    I wish I could tell you the extraordinary beauty of yesterday evening  from the ship. There was a flaming sunset below a pale-green sky, and  then the thousand lights of the ships and the town came out reflected in  the water, and then a brilliant moon. A big American cruiser was  alongside of us.    We shall get no more letters till we land. I have a \"State-room\" all to  myself on the top deck; the waiters and stewards are English, very  polite to us, and the crew are mostly West African negroes, who talk  good English. The ship is very becoming to the white, grey, and red of  our uniforms, or else our uniforms are becoming to the ship, and her  many decks; but why, oh why, are we not all in hospital somewhere?      _Saturday, September 5th._--Had a perfect voyage--getting in to Nantes  to-night--after that no one knows. Shouldn't be surprised if we are sent  home.      LA BAULE, NEAR NANTES.    _Monday, September 7th._--The latest wave of this erratic sea has tossed  us up on to two little French seaside places north of St Nazaire, the  port of Nantes. There are over _500_ Sisters at the two places in  hotels. No.-- and No.-- and part of -- are at La Baule in one enormous  new hotel, which has been taken over for the French wounded on the  bottom floor; the rest was empty till we came. We are in palatial rooms  with balconies overlooking the sea, and have large bathrooms opening out  of our rooms; it is rather like the Riffel in the middle of a forest of  pines, and the sea immediately in front. The expense of it all must be  colossal! Every one is too sick at the state of affairs to enjoy it at  all; some bathe, and you can sit about in the pines or on the sands. We  have had no letters since we left Havre last Thursday, and no news of  the war. We took till Sunday morning to reach St Nazaire, and at midday  were stuffed into a little dirty train for this place. I'm thankful we  didn't have to get out at Pornichet, the station before this, where are  Nos.--, --, --, --, and --.    The Sisters of No.-- who had to leave their hospital at ---- handed  their sick officers and men over to the French hospital, much to their  disgust. The officers especially have a horror of the elegant ways of  the French nurses, who make one water do for washing them all round!      _Tuesday, September 8th._--Orders came last night to each Matron to  provide three or five Sisters who can talk French for duty up country  with a Stationary Hospital, so M. and I are put down with two Regulars  and another Reserve. It is probably too much luck and won't come off.  The duties will be \"very strenuous,\" both for night and day duty, and we  are to carry very little kit. The wire may come at any time. So this  morning M. and I and Miss J----, our Senior Regular, and very nice  indeed, got into the train for St Nazaire to see about our baggage, and  had an adventurous morning. The place was swarming with troops of all  sorts. The 6th Division was being sent up to the Front to-day, and no  medical units could get hold of any transport for storing all their  thousands of tons of stuff. One of the minor errors has been sending the  600 Sisters out with 600 trunks, 600 holdalls, and 600 kit-bags!! The  Sisters' baggage is a byword now, and we could have done with only one  of the three things or 1-1/2. We have been out nearly a month now and  have not been near our boxes; some other hospitals have lost all  theirs, or had them smashed up. We at last traced our No.-- people and  found them encamped on the wharf among the stuff,[1] trying to get it  stored with only one motor transport lent them by the Flying Corps. They  were very nice to us, offered us lunch on packing-cases, and Major  ---- cleaned my skirt with petrol for me!    [Footnote 1: Each hospital contains 78 tons of tents, furniture, stores,  &c.]    They sorted out the five kit-bags and boxes for us from the rest, as we  have to go in to-morrow and repack for duty,--only sleeping kit and  uniform to be taken, and a change of underclothing. They said we'd have  to make our own transport arrangements, as the 6th Division had taken up  everything. So in the town we saw an empty dray outside a public-house,  and after investigating inside two pubs we unearthed a fat man, who took  us to a wine merchant's yard, and he produced a huge dray, which he  handed over to us! We lent it to the Matron of No.--, and we have  commandeered the brewer for No.--'s to-morrow. Then we met a large  French motor ambulance without a French owner, with \"Havre\" on it, which  we knew, and sent Miss ---- in it to the _Asturias_ to try and collar it  for us to-morrow. She did.    There were a lot of Cavalry already mounted just starting, and Welsh  Fusiliers, and Argyll and Sutherlands, and swarms more. We had another  invitation to a packing-case lunch from three other M.O.'s at another  wharf, but couldn't stop.    We saw three German officers led through the crowd at the wharf. The  French crowd booed and groaned and yelled \"Les Assassins\" at them. The  Tommies were quite quiet. They looked white and bored. We also saw 86  men (German prisoners) in a shed on the wharf. Some one who'd been  talking to the German officers told us they were quite cheerful and  absolutely certain Germany is going to win!      _Wednesday, September 9th._--It is a month to-day since I left home, and  seems like six, and no work yet. Isn't it absolutely rotten? A big storm  last night, and the Bay of Biscay tumbling about like fun to-day: bright  and sunny again now. The French infants, boys and girls up to any age,  are all dressed in navy knickers and jerseys and look so jolly. Matron  has gone into St Nazaire to-day to get all the whole boiling of our  baggage out here to repack. P'raps she'll bring some news or some  letters, or, best of all, some orders.    This is a lovely spot. I'm writing on our balcony at the Riffelalp,  above the tops of the pines, and straight over the sea. Three Padres  are stranded at Pornichet--two were troopers in the S.A. War, and they  do duty for us. The window of the glass lounge where we have services  blew in with a crash this morning, right on the top of them, and it took  some time to sort things out, but eventually they went on, in the middle  of the sentence they stopped at.    A French rag this morning had some cheering telegrams about the  Allies--that left, centre, and right were all more than holding their  own, even if the enemy is rather near Paris. What about the Russians who  came through England? We've heard of trains passing through Oxford with  all the blinds down.      _Thursday, September 10th._--Dazzling day. War news, \"L'ennemie se  replie devant l'armee anglaise,\" and that \"Nos allies anglais  poursuivent leur offensive dans la direction de la Marne.\"--All good so  far. No letters yet.      _Friday, September 11th._--It is said to-day that No.-- is to open at  Nantes immediately. That will mean, at the earliest, in a fortnight,  possibly much longer. We five French speakers are again told to stand by  for special orders, but I know it won't come off.    At early service yesterday among the Intercessions was one for patience  in this time of trial waiting for our proper work. Never was there a  more needful Intercession.    Some of us explored the salt-marshes behind this belt of pines  yesterday, up to the farms and to a little old church on the other side;  it was open, and had a little ship hanging over the chancel. The  salt-marshes are intersected by sea walls--with sea pinks and sea  lavender--that you walk along, and there are masses of blackberries  round the farms.    There are rumours that all the hospitals will be getting to work soon,  but I don't believe it. No.-- has lost all its tent-poles, and a lot of  its equipment in the move from Havre. I believe the missing stuff is  supposed to be on its way to Jersey in the _Welshman_ with the German  prisoners.      _Saturday, September 12th._--Rien a dire. Tous les jours meme chose--on  attend des ordres, ce qui ne viennent jamais.      _Sunday, September 13th._--The hospitals seem to be showing faint signs  of moving. No.-- has gone to Versailles, and No.-- to Nantes. No.--  would have gone to Versailles if they hadn't had the bad luck to lose  their tent-poles in the _Welshman_, and their pay-sheets and a few other  important items.    Had to play the hymns at three services to-day without a hymn-book!  Luckily I scratched up 370, 197, 193, 176, and 285, and God Save the  King, out of my head, but \"We are but little children weak\" is the only  other I can do, except \"Peace, Perfect Peace\"! A fine sermon by an  exceptionally good Padre, mainly on Patience and Preparation!      _Sunday Evening, September 13th, La Baule, Nantes._--Orders at last. M.  and I, an Army Sister, and two Army Staff Nurses are to go to Le Mans;  what for, remains to be seen; anyway, it will be work. It seems too good  to be by any possibility true. We may be for Railway Station duty,  feeding and dressings in trains or for a Stationary Hospital, or  anything, or to join No. 5 General at Le Mans.      _Monday, September 14th, Angers_, 8 P.M.--_in the train._--We five got  into the train at La Baule with kit-bags and holdalls, with"]]]
