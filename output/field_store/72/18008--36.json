Then,  during the late Mr. Chamberlain's 'Peace in our time,' he picked up a  refugee Czech chemist and foods-expert named Anton Varcek, who whipped  up a lot of new products. So business got better and better, and they  made more money to spend on advertising to get more money to buy more  advertising to make more money, like Bill Nye's Puritans digging clams  in the winter to get strength to hoe corn in the summer to get strength  to dig clams in the winter.    \"So Premix became a sort of symbol of achievement to Fleming. Then, he  was one of these old-model paternalistic employers, and he was afraid  that if he relinquished control, a lot of his old retainers would be  turned out to grass. And finally, he was opposed in principle to  concentration of business ownership. He claimed it made business more  vulnerable to government control and eventual socialization.\"    \"I'm not sure he didn't have something there,\" Rand considered. \"We get  all our corporate eggs in a few baskets, and they're that much easier for  the planned-economy boys to grab.... Just who, on the Premix side, was in  favor of this merger?\"    \"Just about everybody but Fleming,\" Tipton replied. \"His two sons-in-law,  Fred Dunmore and Varcek, who are first and second vice presidents.  Humphrey Goode, the company attorney, who doubles as board chairman.  All the directors. All the New York banking crowd who are interested  in Premix. And all the two-share tinymites. I don't know who inherits  Fleming's voting interest, but I can find out for you by this time  tomorrow.\"    \"Do that, Tip, and bill me for what you think finding out is worth,\" Rand  said. \"It'll be a novel reversal of order for you to be billing me for an  investigation.... Now, how about the family, as distinct from the  company?\"    \"Well, there's your client, Gladys Fleming. She married Lane Fleming  about ten years ago, when she was twenty-five and he was fifty-five. In  spite of the age difference, I understand it was a fairly happy marriage.  Then, there are two daughters by a previous marriage, Nelda Dunmore and  Geraldine Varcek, and their respective husbands. They all live together,  in a big house at Rosemont. In the company, Dunmore is Sales, and Varcek  is Production. They each have a corner of the mantle of Lane Fleming in  one hand and a dirk in the other. Nelda and Geraldine hate each other  like Greeks and Trojans. Nelda is the nymphomaniac sister, and Geraldine  is the dipsomaniac. From time to time, temporary alliances get formed,  mainly against Gladys; all of them resent the way she married herself  into a third-interest in the estate. You're going to have yourself a  nice, pleasant little stay in the country.\"    \"I'm looking forward to it.\" Rand grimaced. \"You mentioned suicide  rumors. Such as, and who's been spreading them?\"    \"Oh, they are the usual bodyless voices that float about,\" Tipton told  him. \"Emanating, I suspect, from sources interested in shaking out the  less sophisticated small shareholders before the merger. The story is  always approximately the same: That Lane Fleming saw his company drifting  reefward, was unwilling to survive the shipwreck, and performed  _seppuku_. The family are supposed to have faked up the accident  afterward. I dismiss the whole thing as a rather less than subtle bit of  market-manipulation chicanery.\"    \"Or a smoke screen, to cover the defects in camouflaging a murder as an  accident,\" Rand added.    Tipton nodded. \"That could be so, too,\" he agreed. \"Say somebody dislikes  the looks of that accident, and starts investigating. Then he runs into  all this miasma of suicide rumors, and promptly shrugs the whole thing  off. Fleming killed himself, and the family made a few alterations and  are passing it off as an accident. The families of suicides have been  known to do that.\"    \"Yes. Regular defense-in-depth system; if the accident line is  penetrated, the suicide line is back of it,\" Rand said. \"Well, in the  last few years, we've seen defenses in depth penetrated with monotonous  regularity. I've jeeped through a couple, myself, to interrogate the  surviving ex-defenders. It's all in having the guns and armor to smash  through with.\"          CHAPTER 3      Humphrey Goode was sixty-ish, short and chunky, with a fringe of  white hair around a bald crown. His brow was corrugated with wrinkles,  and he peered suspiciously at Rand through a pair of thick-lensed,  black-ribboned glasses. His wide mouth curved downward at the corners  in an expression that was probably intended to be stern and succeeded  only in being pompous. His office was dark, and smelled of dusty books.    \"Mr. Rand,\" he began accusingly, \"when your secretary called to make this  appointment, she informed me that you had been retained by Mrs. Gladys  Fleming.\"    \"That's correct.\" Rand slowly packed tobacco into his pipe and lit it.  \"Mrs. Fleming wants me to look after some interests of hers, and as  you're executor of her late husband's estate, I thought I ought to talk  to you, first of all.\"    Goode's eyes narrowed behind the thick glasses.    \"Mr. Rand, if you're investigating the death of Lane Fleming, you're  wasting your time and Mrs. Fleming's money,\" he lectured. \"There is  nothing whatever for you to find out that is not already public  knowledge. Mr. Fleming was accidentally killed by the discharge of an old  revolver he was cleaning. I don't know what foolish feminine impulse led  Mrs. Fleming to employ you, but you'll do nobody any good in this matter,  and you may do a great deal of harm.\"    \"Did my secretary tell you I was making an investigation?\" Rand demanded  incredulously. \"She doesn't usually make mistakes of that sort.\"    The wrinkles moved up Goode's brow like a battalion advancing in platoon  front. He looked even more narrowly at Rand, his suspicion compounded  with bewilderment.    \"Why should I investigate the death of Lane Fleming?\" Rand continued.  \"As far as I know, Mrs. Fleming is satisfied that it was an accident. She  never expressed any other belief to me. Do you think it was anything  else?\"    \"Why, of course not!\" Goode exclaimed. \"That's just what I was telling  you. I--\" He took a fresh start. \"There have been rumors--utterly without  foundation, of course--that Mr. Fleming committed suicide. They are, I  may say, nothing but malicious fabrications, circulated for the purpose  of undermining public confidence in Premix Foods, Incorporated. I had  thought that perhaps Mrs. Fleming might have heard them, and decided, on  her own responsibility, to bring you in to scotch them; I was afraid that  such a step might, by giving these rumors fresh currency, defeat its  intended purpose.\"    \"Oh, nothing of the sort!\" Rand told him. \"I'm not in the least  interested in how Mr. Fleming was killed, and the question is simply  not involved in what Mrs. Fleming wants me to do.\"    He stopped there. Goode was looking at him sideways, sucking in one  corner of his mouth and pushing out the other. It was not a facial  contortion that impressed Rand favorably; it was too reminiscent of  a high-school principal under whom he had suffered, years ago, in  Vicksburg, Mississippi. Rand began to suspect that Goode might be just  another such self-righteous, opinionated, egotistical windbag. Such men  could be dangerous, were usually quite unscrupulous, and were almost  always unpleasant to deal with.    \"Then why,\" the lawyer demanded, \"did Mrs. Fleming employ you?\"    \"Well, as you know,\" Rand began, \"the Fleming pistol-collection, now the  joint property of Mrs. Fleming and her two stepdaughters, is an extremely  valuable asset. Mr. Fleming spent the better part of his life gathering  it. At one time or another, he must have owned between four and five  thousand different pistols and revolvers. The twenty-five hundred left to  his heirs represent the result of a systematic policy of discriminating  purchase, replacement of inferior items, and general improvement. It's  one of the largest and most famous collections of its kind in the  country.\"    \"Well?\" Goode was completely out of his depth by now. \"Surely Mrs.  Fleming doesn't think...?\"    \"Mrs. Fleming thinks that expert advice is urgently needed in disposing  of that collection,\" Rand replied, carefully picking his words to fit  what he estimated to be Goode's probable semantic reactions. \"She has  the utmost confidence in your ability and integrity, as an attorney;  however, she realized that you could hardly describe yourself as an  antique-arms expert. It happens that I am an expert in antique firearms,  particularly pistols. I have a collection of my own, I am the author of  a number of articles on the subject, and I am recognized as something  of an authority. I know arms-values, and understand market conditions.  Furthermore, not being a dealer, or connected with any museum, I have no  mercenary motive for undervaluing the collection. That's all there is to  it; Mrs. Fleming has retained me as a firearms-expert, in connection with  the collection.\"    Goode was looking at Rand as though the latter had just torn off a mask,  revealing another and entirely different set of features underneath. The  change seemed to be a welcome one, but he was evidently having trouble  adjusting to it. Rand grinned inwardly; now he was going to have to find  himself a new set of verbal labels and identifications.    \"Well, Mr. Rand, that alters the situation considerably,\" he said, with  noticeably less hostility. He was still a bit resentful; people had no  right to confuse him by jumping about from one category to another, like  that. \"Now understand, I'm not trying to be offensive, but it seems a  little unusual for a private detective also to be an authority on antique  firearms.\"    \"Mr. Fleming was an authority on antique firearms, and he was a  manufacturer of foodstuffs,\" Rand parried, carefully staying inside  Goode's Aristotelian"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#4)"],[1,"reason is because, just as in the process of reasoning,  the principle is that which is naturally known, so in the process of  the rational appetite, i.e. the will, the principle needs to be that  which is naturally desired. Now this must needs be one: since nature  tends to one thing only. But the principle in the process of the  rational appetite is the last end. Therefore that to which the will  tends, as to its last end, is one.    The third reason is because, since voluntary actions receive their  species from the end, as stated above (A. 3), they must needs receive  their genus from the last end, which is common to them all: just as  natural things are placed in a genus according to a common form.  Since, then, all things that can be desired by the will, belong, as  such, to one genus, the last end must needs be one. And all the more  because in every genus there is one first principle; and the last end  has the nature of a first principle, as stated above. Now as the last  end of man, simply as man, is to the whole human race, so is the last  end of any individual man to that individual. Therefore, just as of  all men there is naturally one last end, so the will of an individual  man must be fixed on one last end.    Reply Obj. 1: All these several objects were considered as one  perfect good resulting therefrom, by those who placed in them the  last end.    Reply Obj. 2: Although it is possible to find several things which  are not in opposition to one another, yet it is contrary to a thing's  perfect good, that anything besides be required for that thing's  perfection.    Reply Obj. 3: The power of the will does not extend to making  opposites exist at the same time. Which would be the case were it to  tend to several diverse objects as last ends, as has been shown above  (ad 2).  ________________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 6]    Whether Man Wills All, Whatsoever He Wills, for the Last End?    Objection 1: It would seem that man does not will all, whatsoever he  wills, for the last end. For things ordained to the last end are said  to be serious matter, as being useful. But jests are foreign to  serious matter. Therefore what man does in jest, he ordains not to  the last end.    Obj. 2: Further, the Philosopher says at the beginning of his  Metaphysics (i. 2) that speculative science is sought for its own sake.  Now it cannot be said that each speculative science is the last end.  Therefore man does not desire all, whatsoever he desires, for the last  end.    Obj. 3: Further, whosoever ordains something to an end, thinks of  that end. But man does not always think of the last end in all that  he desires or does. Therefore man neither desires nor does all for  the last end.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 1): \"That is the  end of our good, for the sake of which we love other things, whereas  we love it for its own sake.\"    _I answer that,_ Man must, of necessity, desire all, whatsoever he  desires, for the last end. This is evident for two reasons. First,  because whatever man desires, he desires it under the aspect of good.  And if he desire it, not as his perfect good, which is the last end,  he must, of necessity, desire it as tending to the perfect good,  because the beginning of anything is always ordained to its  completion; as is clearly the case in effects both of nature and of  art. Wherefore every beginning of perfection is ordained to complete  perfection which is achieved through the last end. Secondly, because  the last end stands in the same relation in moving the appetite, as  the first mover in other movements. Now it is clear that secondary  moving causes do not move save inasmuch as they are moved by the first  mover. Therefore secondary objects of the appetite do not move the  appetite, except as ordained to the first object of the appetite,  which is the last end.    Reply Obj. 1: Actions done jestingly are not directed to any external  end; but merely to the good of the jester, in so far as they afford  him pleasure or relaxation. But man's consummate good is his last end.    Reply Obj. 2: The same applies to speculative science; which is  desired as the scientist's good, included in complete and perfect  good, which is the ultimate end.    Reply Obj. 3: One need not always be thinking of the last end,  whenever one desires or does something: but the virtue of the first  intention, which was in respect of the last end, remains in every  desire directed to any object whatever, even though one's thoughts be  not actually directed to the last end. Thus while walking along the  road one needs not to be thinking of the end at every step.  ________________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 7]    Whether All Men Have the Same Last End?    Objection 1: It would seem that all men have not the same last end.  For before all else the unchangeable good seems to be the last end of  man. But some turn away from the unchangeable good, by sinning.  Therefore all men have not the same last end.    Obj. 2: Further, man's entire life is ruled according to his last  end. If, therefore, all men had the same last end, they would not  have various pursuits in life. Which is evidently false.    Obj. 3: Further, the end is the term of action. But actions are of  individuals. Now although men agree in their specific nature, yet  they differ in things pertaining to individuals. Therefore all men  have not the same last end.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 3) that all men  agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness.    _I answer that,_ We can speak of the last end in two ways: first,  considering only the aspect of last end; secondly, considering the  thing in which the aspect of last end is realized. So, then, as to  the aspect of last end, all agree in desiring the last end: since all  desire the fulfilment of their perfection, and it is precisely this  fulfilment in which the last end consists, as stated above (A. 5).  But as to the thing in which this aspect is realized, all men are not  agreed as to their last end: since some desire riches as their  consummate good; some, pleasure; others, something else. Thus to  every taste the sweet is pleasant but to some, the sweetness of wine  is most pleasant, to others, the sweetness of honey, or of something  similar. Yet that sweet is absolutely the best of all pleasant  things, in which he who has the best taste takes most pleasure. In  like manner that good is most complete which the man with well  disposed affections desires for his last end.    Reply Obj. 1: Those who sin turn from that in which their last end  really consists: but they do not turn away from the intention of the  last end, which intention they mistakenly seek in other things.    Reply Obj. 2: Various pursuits in life are found among men by reason  of the various things in which men seek to find their last end.    Reply Obj. 3: Although actions are of individuals, yet their first  principle of action is nature, which tends to one thing, as stated  above (A. 5).  ________________________    EIGHTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 8]    Whether Other Creatures Concur in That Last End?    Objection 1: It would seem that all other creatures concur in man's  last end. For the end corresponds to the beginning. But man's  beginning--i.e. God--is also the beginning of all else. Therefore  all other things concur in man's last end.    Obj. 2: Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that \"God turns all  things to Himself as to their last end.\" But He is also man's last  end; because He alone is to be enjoyed by man, as Augustine says (De  Doctr. Christ. i, 5, 22). Therefore other things, too, concur in man's  last end.    Obj. 3: Further, man's last end is the object of the will. But the  object of the will is the universal good, which is the end of all.  Therefore other things, too, concur in man's last end.    _On the contrary,_ man's last end is happiness; which all men desire,  as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 3, 4). But \"happiness is not  possible for animals bereft of reason,\" as Augustine says (QQ. 83,  qu. 5). Therefore other things do not concur in man's last end.    _I answer that,_ As the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 2), the end is  twofold--the end \"for which\" and the end \"by which\"; viz. the thing  itself in which is found the aspect of good, and the use or  acquisition of that thing. Thus we say that the end of the movement of  a weighty body is either a lower place as \"thing,\" or to be in a lower  place, as \"use\"; and the end of the miser is money as \"thing,\" or  possession of money as \"use.\"    If, therefore, we speak of man's last end as of the thing which is the  end, thus all other things concur in man's last end, since God is the  last end of man and of all other things. If, however, we speak of  man's last end, as of the acquisition of the end, then irrational  creatures do not concur with man in this end. For man and other  rational creatures attain to their last end by knowing and loving God:  this is not possible to other creatures, which acquire their last end,  in so far as they share in the Divine likeness, inasmuch as they are,  or live, or even know.    Hence it is evident how the objections are solved: since happiness  means the acquisition of the last end.  ________________________    QUESTION 2    OF THOSE THINGS IN WHICH MAN'S HAPPINESS CONSISTS  (In Eight Articles)    We have now to consider happiness: and (1) in what it consists; (2)  what it is; (3) how we can obtain it.    Concerning the first there are eight points of inquiry:    (1) Whether happiness consists in wealth?    (2) Whether in honor?    (3) Whether in fame or glory?    (4) Whether in power?    (5) Whether in any good of the body?    (6) Whether in pleasure?    (7) Whether in any good of the soul?
