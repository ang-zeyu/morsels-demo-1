[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#4)"],[1," such a  woman will one day rule over the known peoples. I was assured some  years ago, by a very learned pundit, that a princess of incalculably  ancient lineage, residing in some secret monastery in Tartary or Tibet,  was to be the future empress of the world. I believe this tradition,  or the extensive group who seek to keep it alive and potent, to be  what is called the Si-Fan!\"    I was past greater amazement; but--    \"This lady can be no longer young, then?\" I asked.    \"On the contrary, Petrie, she remains always young and beautiful by  means of a continuous series of reincarnations; also she thus  conserves the collated wisdom of many ages. In short, she is the  archetype of Lamaism. The real secret of Lama celibacy is the existence  of this immaculate ruler, of whom the Grand Lama is merely a high  priest. She has, as attendants, maidens of good family, selected for  their personal charms, and rendered dumb in order that they may never  report what they see and hear.\"    \"Smith!\" I cried, \"this is utterly incredible!\"    \"Her body slaves are not only mute, but blind; for it is death to look  upon her beauty unveiled.\"    I stood up impatiently.    \"You are amusing yourself,\" I said.    Nayland Smith clapped his hands upon my shoulders, in his own  impulsive fashion, and looked earnestly into my eyes.    \"Forgive me, old man,\" he said, \"if I have related all these fantastic  particulars as though I gave them credence. Much of this is legendary,  I know, some of it mere superstition, but--I am serious now, Petrie--  _part of it is true_.\"    I stared at the square-cut, sun-tanned face; and no trace of a smile  lurked about that grim mouth. \"Such a woman may actually exist, Petrie,  only in legend; but, nevertheless, she forms the head center of that  giant conspiracy in which the activities of Dr. Fu-Manchu were merely  a part. Hale blundered on to this stupendous business; and from what I  have gathered from Beeton and what I have seen for myself, it is  evident that in yonder coffer\"--he pointed to the brass chest standing  hard by--\"Hale got hold of something indispensable to the success of  this vast Yellow conspiracy. That he was followed here, to the very  hotel, by agents of this mystic Unknown is evident. But,\" he added  grimly, \"they have failed in their object!\"    A thousand outrageous possibilities fought for precedence in my mind.    \"Smith!\" I cried, \"the half-caste woman whom I saw in the hotel ...\"    Nayland Smith shrugged his shoulders.    \"Probably, as M. Samarkan suggests, an _ayah!_\" he said; but there was  an odd note in his voice and an odd look in his eyes.    \"Then again, I am almost certain that Hale's warning concerning 'the  man with the limp' was no empty one. Shall you open the brass chest?\"    \"At present, decidedly _no_. Hale's fate renders his warning one that  I dare not neglect. For I was with him when he died; and they cannot  know how much _I_ know. How did he die? How did he die? How was the  Flower of Silence introduced into his closely guarded room?\"    \"The Flower of Silence?\"    Smith laughed shortly and unmirthfully.    \"I was once sent for,\" he said, \"during the time that I was stationed  in Upper Burma, to see a stranger--a sort of itinerant Buddhist priest,  so I understood, who had desired to communicate some message to me  personally. He was dying--in a dirty hut on the outskirts of Manipur,  up in the hills. When I arrived I say at a glance that the man was a  Tibetan monk. He must have crossed the river and come down through  Assam; but the nature of his message I never knew. He had lost the  power of speech! He was gurgling, inarticulate, just like poor Hale.  A few moments after my arrival he breathed his last. The fellow who  had guided me to the place bent over him--I shall always remember the  scene--then fell back as though he had stepped upon an adder.    \"'He holds the Flower Silence in his hand!' he cried--'the Si-Fan! the  Si-Fan!'--and bolted from the hut.\"    \"When I went to examine the dead man, sure enough he held in one hand  a little crumpled spray of flowers. I did not touch it with my fingers  naturally, but I managed to loop a piece of twine around the stem,  and by that means I gingerly removed the flowers and carried them to  an orchid-hunter of my acquaintance who chanced to be visiting Manipur.    \"Grahame--that was my orchid man's name--pronounced the specimen to be  an unclassified species of _jatropha;_ belonging to the _Curcas_  family. He discovered a sort of hollow thorn, almost like a fang,  amongst the blooms, but was unable to surmise the nature of its  functions. He extracted enough of a certain fixed oil from the flowers,  however, to have poisoned the pair of us!\"    \"Probably the breaking of a bloom ...\"    \"Ejects some of this acrid oil through the thorn? Practically the  uncanny thing stings when it is hurt? That is my own idea, Petrie. And  I can understand how these Eastern fanatics accept their sentence--  silence and death--when they have deserved it, at the hands of their  mysterious organization, and commit this novel form of _hara-kiri_.  But I shall not sleep soundly with that brass coffer in my possession  until I know by what means Sir Gregory was induced to touch a Flower  of Silence, and by what means it was placed in his room!\"    \"But, Smith, why did you direct me to-night to repeat the words,  'Sakya Muni'?\"    Smith smiled in a very grim fashion.    \"It was after the episode I have just related that I made the  acquaintance of that pundit, some of whose statements I have already  quoted for your enlightenment. He admitted that the Flower of Silence  was an instrument frequently employed by a certain group, adding that,  according to some authorities, one who had touched the flower might  escape death by immediately pronouncing the sacred name of Buddha. He  was no fanatic himself, however, and, marking my incredulity, he  explained that the truth was this;--    \"No one whose powers of speech were imperfect could possibly pronounce  correctly the words 'Sakya Muni.' Therefore, since the first  effects of this damnable thing is instantly to tie the tongue, the  uttering of the sacred name of Buddha becomes practically a test  whereby the victim my learn whether the venom has entered his system  or not!\"    I repressed a shudder. An atmosphere of horror seemed to be enveloping  us, foglike.    \"Smith,\" I said slowly, \"we must be on our guard,\" for at last I had  run to earth that elusive memory. \"Unless I am strangely mistaken,  the 'man' who so mysteriously entered Hale's room and the supposed  _ayah_ whom I met downstairs are one and the same. Two, at least, of  the Yellow group are actually here in the New Louvre!\"    The light of the shaded lamp shone down upon the brass coffer on the  table beside me. The fog seemed to have cleared from the room somewhat,  but since in the midnight stillness I could detect the muffled sounds  of sirens from the river and the reports of fog signals from the  railways, I concluded that the night was not yet wholly clear of the  choking mist. In accordance with a pre-arranged scheme we had decided  to guard \"the key of India\" (whatever it might be) turn and turn about  through the night. In a word--we feared to sleep unguarded. Now my  watch informed me that four o'clock approached, at which hour I was  to arouse Smith and retire to sleep to my own bedroom.    Nothing had disturbed my vigil--that is, nothing definite. True once,  about half an hour earlier, I had thought I heard the dragging and  tapping sound from somewhere up above me; but since the corridor  overhead was unfinished and none of the rooms opening upon it yet  habitable, I concluded that I had been mistaken. The stairway at the  end of our corridor, which communicated with that above, was still  blocked with bags of cement and slabs of marble, in fact.    Faintly to my ears came the booming of London's clocks, beating out  the hour of four. But still I sat beside the mysterious coffer,  indisposed to awaken my friend any sooner than was necessary,  particularly since I felt in no way sleepy myself.    I was to learn a lesson that night: the lesson of strict adherence to  a compact. I had arranged to awaken Nayland Smith at four; and because  I dallied, determined to finish my pipe ere entering his bedroom,  almost it happened that Fate placed it beyond my power ever to awaken  him again.    At ten minutes past four, amid a stillness so intense that the  creaking of my slippers seemed a loud disturbance, I crossed the room  and pushed open the door of Smith's bedroom. It was in darkness, but  as I entered I depressed the switch immediately inside the door,  lighting the lamp which swung form the center of the ceiling.    Glancing towards the bed, I immediately perceived that there was  something different in its aspect, but at first I found this  difference difficult to define. I stood for a moment in doubt. Then  I realized the nature of the change which had taken place.    A lamp hung above the bed, attached to a movable fitting, which  enabled it to be raised or lowered at the pleasure of the occupant.  When Smith had retired he was in no reading mood, and he had not even  lighted the reading-lamp, but had left it pushed high up against the  ceiling.    It was the position of this lamp which had changed. For now it swung  so low over the pillow that the silken fringe of the shade almost  touched my friend's face as he lay soundly asleep with one  lean brown hand outstretched upon the coverlet.    I stood in the doorway staring, mystified, at this phenomenon; I might  have stood there without intervening, until intervention had been too  late, were it not that, glancing upward toward the wooden block from  which ordinarily the pendant hung, I perceived that no block was  visible, but only a round, black cavity from which the white flex  supporting the lamp swung out.

RUNWAYS AND TRACKS.    Still other features add to the interest in the dwelling places of  _spectabilis_. Radiating in various directions from some of the openings  of the mounds well-used runways are to be seen, some of them fading out  in the surrounding vegetation, but others extending 30, 40, or even 50  or more yards to neighboring burrows or mounds (Pl. V, Fig. 2; Pl. VI,  Fig. 1). These runways and the entrances to the mounds are well worn,  showing that the inhabitants are at home and are at some time of day  very active. The worn paths become most conspicuous in the autumnal  harvest season, when they stand out in strong contrast to surrounding  grass. One usually finds not far distant from the main habitation one or  more smaller burrows, each with from one to three typical openings,  connected by the trail or runway system with the central den, and these  we have called \"subsidiary burrows\" (Pl. VI, Fig. 2). These will be  again referred to in discussing the detailed plan of the entire shelter  system.    Examination of the runways and of the denuded area about a mound  discloses an abundance of almost indecipherable tracks. The dust or sand  is ordinarily much too dry and shifting to record clear footprints, and  there are no opportunities to see footprints of this species recorded in  good impressionable soil. Very characteristic traces of kangaroo rats  may be readily observed in the dust about the mounds, however, and these  are long, narrow, sometimes curving, furrows made by the long tails as  the animals whisk about their work or play.      [Illustration: PLATE V. FIG. 1.--CLEARING ABOUT A MOUND.    A typical clearing about a mound of _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_, showing  the autumnal denudation of the mound and surrounding areas.

If a scratching or tapping sound be made at the mouth of a burrow, even  in the daytime, one is likely to hear a muffled tapping in response, and  this may at times be heard while one is engaged in excavating a mound.  It has a chirring or fluttering quality, described by Fisher as  resembling the noise of a quail flying. Bailey (1905, 148) is of the  opinion that it is used as a signal of alarm, call note, or challenge, a  view which the present authors believe to be correct. During the winter  of 1920-21, however, both Bailey and Vorhies discovered that this sound,  or a very similar one, is made by the rapid action of the forefeet in  digging. On one occasion in the laboratory the sound was given by one of  a pair and was responded to at once by the other, the two being in  separate but contiguous cages. This observation, however, could not be  repeated. (Vorhies MS.)    One evening, while working in the vicinity of the Burro Mountains, N.  Mex., Goldman heard a kangaroo rat near camp making this thumping noise.  Taking a lantern, he approached the den, very cautiously, until within  10 feet. The kangaroo rat was just outside the entrance of one of its  burrows, and though moving about more or less restlessly at first showed  little fear, and kept up the thumping or drumming at intervals. When  making the noise the animal was standing with the forefeet on the ground  and the tail lying extended. The noise seemed to be made with the hind  feet only, and the vibration of the feet could be seen. The tapping was  kept up for a second or two at a time, the sounds coming close together  and being repeated rhythmically after a very short interval, suggesting  the distant galloping of a horse. After continuing in this way for a  short time, the animal turned quickly about, with its head in the  opposite direction, and began tapping. It appeared to pay little  attention to the light, but finally gave a sudden bound and entered one  of its holes about 4 feet from the one in front of which it had been  standing.    Vorhies has repeatedly noted when watching for the appearance of a  kangaroo rat at night that this sound invariably precedes the rodent's  first emergence into the open, and often its appearance after an alarm,  though when the storage season has begun and the kangaroo rat is  carrying loads of grass heads or other material into its den, it  regularly comes out without preliminary signaling. Vorhies has also  observed it making the sound while on top of the mound, and certainly  not digging, but was unable to see how it was made.      VOICE.    No data concerning any call notes or sounds other than those described  above are at hand, with the following exception: Price (in Allen, 1895,  213), who studied the habits of the animal in the moonlight, at Willcox,  Ariz., says that a low chuckle was uttered at intervals; and Vorhies has  had one captive female that would repeatedly utter a similar chuckle in  a peevish manner when disturbed by day, and one captive male which, when  teased into a state of anger and excitement, would squeal much like a  cornered house rat. Vorhies has spent many moonlight hours observing  kangaroo rats, but without ever hearing a vocal sound uttered by free  individuals.      DAILY AND SEASONAL ACTIVITY.    The kangaroo rat is strictly nocturnal. An observer watching patiently  by a den in the evening for the animal's first appearance is not  rewarded until darkness has fallen completely, and unless the moon is  shining the animal can hardly be seen. Were it not for the white  tail-brush of _spectabilis_ and its white belly when upright on the hind  legs and tail, one could not as a rule see the animal at all when it  makes its first evening appearance. With the first streak of dawn  activity usually ceases completely and much more abruptly than it began  with the coming of darkness, but on a recent occasion Vorhies observed  that a kangaroo rat which did not appear until near morning remained  above ground until quite light, but not fully daylight. On removal of  the plug from the mouth of a kangaroo rat burrow, one may sometimes see  a fresh mass of earth and refuse shoved into the opening from within. As  often as not, however, even this unwelcome attention does not elicit any  response by day, the great majority of the burrow openings of this  species, as observed by the authors, remaining permanently open.    The ordinary activities of the kangaroo rat in southern Arizona can  scarcely be said to show any true seasonal variation. The animals are  active all the year in this region, there being neither hibernation nor  estivation, both perhaps being rendered unnecessary by the storage  habit, to be discussed in full later (pp. 15-16), and by the mildness of  the winter climate. On any particular night that the weather is rainy,  or the ground too wet and cold, activity is confined to the interior of  the burrow system, and for this reason one has no opportunity to see a  perfect imprint of the foot in freshly wet soil or in snow. On two or  three of the comparatively rare occasions on which there was a light  fall of snow on the Range Reserve a search was made for tracks in the  snow. At these times, however, as on rainy nights, the only signs of  activity were the pushing or throwing out of fresh earth and food refuse  from within the burrow. This is so common a sight as to be complete  evidence that the animals are active within their dens during stormy  weather but do not venture outside. Trapping has again and again proved  to be useless on rainy nights, unless the rain is scant and a part of  the night favorable, in which case occasional individuals are taken.  These statements apply to the Range Reserve particularly; the facts may  be quite different where the animals experience more winter, as at  Albuquerque, N. Mex., although in November, 1921, Vorhies noted no  indications of lessened activity in that region.      PUGNACITY AND SOCIABILITY.    So far as their reactions toward man are concerned, kangaroo rats are  gentle and make confiding and interesting pets; this is especially the  case with _merriami_. This characteristic is the more surprising in view  of the fact that they will fight each other so readily and so viciously,  and yet probably it is explained in part by their method of fighting.  They do not appear to use their teeth toward each other, but fight by  leaping in the air and striking with the powerful hind feet, reminding  one most forcibly of a pair of game cocks, facing each other and  guarding in the same manner. Sometimes they carry on a sparring match  with their fore feet. Biting, if done at all, is only a secondary means  of combat. When taken in hand, even for the first time, they will use  their teeth only in the event that they are wounded. The jaws are not  powerful, and though the animals may lay hold of a bare finger, with the  apparent intention of biting, usually they do not succeed in drawing  blood. As Bailey says (1905, 148), they are gentle and timid, and, like  rabbits, depend upon flight and their burrows for protection.    The well-traveled trails elsewhere described (p. 10) indicate a degree  of sociability difficult to explain in connection"]]]
