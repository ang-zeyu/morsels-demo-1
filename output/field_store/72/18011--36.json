In constructive  ability our Indians are singularly deficient, just as it is with  greatest difficulty that they can be induced even on a small scale to  practice agriculture. It has been objected to this conclusion that the  Indians can make a canoe, which is a marvel in its way. But there is a  great difference in the two cases. In the canoe all the materials  remain the same. The approximation to a chemical process makes the  pottery manufacture a much more complicated matter. Indeed the Indian  in token of his surprise at his success in being even able to  construct a canoe, states in his tradition that it is the gift of the  Manitou. Furthermore the mound builder used metal tools, and was  probably a metal worker. It is true the copper implements mentioned,  as having been found were brought to Rainy and Red Rivers. I have,  however, pointed out the intimate connection judging by the line of  transport subsisting between Rainy River and Lake Superior, the mining  locality for copper. To sink a mine in the unyielding Huronian rock of  Lake Superior, with mallet and hammer and wedge and fire, take out the  native copper, work it into the desired tools, and then temper these  requires skill and adaptation unpossessed by the Indians. For  centuries we know that the Lake Superior mine in which are found tools  and timber constructions, have been buried, filled in for ten feet  with debris, and have rank vegetation and trees growing upon them. It  is certain that the Indian races, even when shown the example, cannot  when left alone follow the mining pursuit. Not only then by the  ethnological, and other data cited do we conclude that the mound  builders belong to a different race from the present Indians, but the  tradition of the Indians is to the same effect. Then    WHO WERE THE MOUND BUILDERS?    I would lead you back now to what little we know from the different  sources, of the early history of our continent. When the Spaniards  came to Mexico in the early years of the 16th century, Montezuma, an  Aztec prince was on the throne. The Aztecs gave themselves out as  intruders in Mexico. They were a bloody and warlike race, and though  they gave the Spaniards an easy victory it was rather a reception, for  they were overawed by superstition as to the invaders. They stated  that a few centuries before, they had been a wild tribe on the high  country of the Rio Grande and Colorado, in New Mexico. The access  from the Pacific up the Colorado would agree well with the hypothesis  that the chief sources of the aboriginal inhabitants of America were  Mongolian, and that from parties of Mongols landing from the Pacific  Isles on the American coast, the population was derived. At any rate  the Aztecs stated that before they invaded Mexico from their original  home, they were preceded by a civilized race, well acquainted with the  arts and science, knowing more art and astronomy in particular than  they. They stated that they had exterminated this race known as    THE TOLTECS.    The main features of the story seem correct. The Toltecs seem to have  been allied to the Peruvians. Their skulls seem of the Brachycephalic  type. The Toltecs were agriculturists, were mechanical, industrial,  and constructive. In Mexico, and further south in Nicaragua, as well  as northward, large mounds remain which are traced to them. According  to the Aztec story the Toltecans spread in Mexico from the seventh to  the twelfth century at which latter day they were swept away. My  theory is that it was this race--which must have been very  numerous--which either came from Peru in South America, capturing  Mexico and then flowing northward; or perhaps came from New Mexico,  the American Scythia of that day, and sending one branch down into  Mexico, sent another down the Rio Grande, which then spread up the  Mississippi and its tributaries The mounds mark the course of this  race migration. They are found on the Mississippi. One part of the  race seems to have ascended the Ohio to the great lakes and the St.  Lawrence, another went up the Missouri, while another ascended the  Mississippi proper and gained communication from its head waters with  the Rainy and Red Rivers. When then did the crest of this wave of  migration reach its furthest northward point? Taking the seventh  century as the date of the first movement of the Toltecs toward  conquest in Mexico, I have set three or four centuries as the probable  time taken for multiplication and the displacement of former tribes,  until they reached and possessed this northern region of \"The  Takagamies,\" or far north mound builders. This would place their  occupation of Rainy River in the eleventh century. Other  considerations to which I shall refer seem to sustain this as the  probable date. The grand mound is by far the    LARGEST MOUND    on Rainy River. It is likewise at the mouth of the Bowstring River,  which is its largest tributary and affords the readiest means of  access from the Mississippi up which the Toltecan flood of emigration  was surging. My theory is that here in their new homes, for three  centuries they multiplied, cultivated the soil, and built the mounds  which are still a monument to their industry. Here they became less  warlike because more industrious, and hence less able to defend  themselves. I have already stated that the    AZTEC WHIRLWIND OF CONQUEST    swept into Mexico from the Northwest about the twelfth century. The  sanguinary horde partly destroyed and partly seized for its own use  the civilization of the Toltecans. We have specially to do with an  Aztec wave that seems to have surged up the valley of the Mississippi.  As the great conquering people captured one region, they would settle  upon it, and send off a new hive of marauders. Indian tribes, numerous  but of the same savage type, are marked by the old Geographers as  occupying the Mississippi valley. It was when one part of the northern  horde came up the valley of the Ohio, as the Savage Iroquois, and  another up the head waters of the Mississippi as the Sioux, the tigers  of the plains, that we became familiar in the sixteenth century with  this race. The French recognized the Sioux as the same race as the  Iroquois and called them \"Iroquets\" or little Iroquois. The two  nations were confederate in their form of government; they had all the  fury of Aztecs, and resemblances of a sufficiently marked kind are  found between Sioux or Dakota and the Iroquois dialect, while their  skulls follow the Dolichocephalic type of cranium. With fire and sword  the invaders swept away the Toltecs; their mines were deserted and  filled up with debris; their arts of agriculture, metal working and  pottery making were lost; and up to the extreme limits of our country  of the Takawgamis, only the mounds and their contents were left.    OUR HISTORIC ERA    saw the expiring blaze of this tremendous conflagration just as the  French arrived in Canada. Cartier saw a race in 1535 in Hochelaga, who  are believed to have had Brachycephalic crania, who were  agriculturists, used at least implements of metal, dwelt in large  houses, made pottery and were constructive in tendency. In 1608 when  Champlain visited the same spot, there were none of the Hochelagans  remaining. This remnant of the Toltecans had been swept out of  existence between the Algonquin wave from the east and the Iroquois  from the southwest. The French heard of a similar race called the  Eries and of another the Neutrals, who had the same habits and customs  as the vanished Hochelagans, but who had been visited by the scourge  of the Iroquois on the Ohio as they ascended it, and had perished.  Thus from the twelfth century, the time set for the irruption of the  savage tribes from New Mexico, two or three centuries would probably  suffice to sweep away the last even of the farthest north Takawgamis.  This, say the fifteenth century, would agree very well, not only with  time estimated by the early French explorers, but also with the  tradition of the Crees who claim that for three or four centuries they  have lived sole possessors upon the borders of Lake Superior, Lake of  the Woods, and Lake Winnipeg. Our theory then is that the mound  builders occupied the region of Rainy and Red Rivers from the eleventh  to the fifteenth centuries. Their works remain.    HOW OLD    then are the mounds? If our conclusions are correct the oldest mound  in our region cannot exceed 800 years, and the most recent must have  been completed upwards of 400 years ago. Look at further  considerations, which lead to these conclusions. We learn, that 200  years ago, viz.: in 1683, the \"Clistinos\" and \"Assinipouals\" (Crees  and Assiniboines) were in their present country. The Crees were at  that time in the habit of visiting both Lake Superior and Hudson's Bay  for the purpose of trade. They were then extensive nations and no  trace of a nation which preceded them was got from them. The fallen  tree on the top of the grand mound, judging by the concentric rings of  its trunk is 150 or 200 years old, and yet its stump stands in a foot  or more of mould that must have taken longer than that time to form.  Even among savage nations it would take upwards of half a dozen  generations of men, to lose the memory of so great a catastrophe as  the destruction of a former populous race. Then some 400 years ago  would agree with the time of extermination of the Hochelagans, or with  the destruction of the Eries, who according to Labontan were blotted  out before the French came to the continent. The Hochelagans, Eries,  and Takawgamis being northern in their habitat, I take it were among  the last of the Toltecans who survived. The white man but arrived upon  the scene to succeed the farmer, the metal worker and the potter, who  had passed away so disastrously, and to be the avenger of the lost  race, in driving before him the savage red man.

About 1.4 million Afghan refugees remain in    Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million probably moved    into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.
