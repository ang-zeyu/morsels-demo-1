In a river so small as the  Ribble, it will be readily believed that not many fish can deposit  their spawn in safety, when practices of this kind are followed  almost openly, and when no one feels a sufficient interest in the  matter to put a stop to them. A single party of poachers killed  four hundred Salmon in one spawning season near the source of the  river; the roe of which, when potted, they sold for L20. Need we  be surprised, then, if the breed decreases? The only wonder is that  they have not been exterminated long ago.    I may perhaps be allowed to say what, in my opinion, would remedy  this alarming destruction, particularly as no one hitherto seems  to have devised an efficient preventive. I believe that in 1826  there was an Act of Parliament passed which either repealed or  modified some of the old laws on the subject, and I have also  understood that the good effects of this new law are already  perceptible in Scotland, to which it is exclusively applied. There  was a bill introduced into Parliament in 1825 which was intended  to apply to the whole kingdom; but some of the clauses were so  very objectionable, that if they had been carried they could not  possibly have been enforced without stopping and ruining the  manufactories which were carried on by water-power, and the bill  was consequently abandoned. The first thing to be done is to give  the proprietors on the upper part of the river such an interest in  the fisheries as will make them anxious about the preservation of  the fish in the spawning season; and to accomplish so desirable an  object no one ought to fish or keep a net stretched across a river  for more than twelve hours each day, or from sunrise to sunset;  and every mill-owner ought to be compelled to facilitate the  passage of the fish over his weir by every means consistent with  the proper supply of water to his wheels. At present the fisheries  at the mouths and lower parts of rivers so completely prevent the  access of the fish to the upper parts, that unless there happen to  be high floods, which prevent the fishermen below from keeping  their nets in, the upper proprietors comparatively seldom see any  until the season is at an end. The evidence before the House of  Commons on this point is exceedingly amusing. One person thinks  the upper proprietors have no right to expect any fish, as they  have never paid any consideration for them when they bought their  estates; another states that he pays L7,000 a year to the Duke of  Gordon, and that if he is compelled to observe a weekly (not a  daily) close time, he will lose that proportion of his rent;  another observes the weekly close time, and opens a passage for  the fish, but places a crocodile, painted in very glaring colours,  in the gap to frighten them back again; another says he observes  the weekly close time in his cruive fishing, but no one is allowed  to inspect the cruives; another sends men to break down the stake  nets in the estuary, which reach from high to low water-mark, and  at the same time stretches a net completely across the river from  March to August, so that a fish cannot pass without his  permission. No wonder that fish are scarce in the upper parts of  the river, when such samples of _disinterestedness_ are manifested  by the proprietors of the fisheries below. No wonder that the  upper proprietors should be careless about the protection of fish  from which they are not allowed to derive any benefit. No wonder  that they should connive at, and even encourage, the shameful  destruction of fish in close time, since that is the only time  they are allowed to have any. Let the fishermen below make it  worth the while of the upper proprietors to protect the fish, and  they will receive that protection; but it is too much to expect  from human nature that these proprietors will take all the odium  and trouble of preserving them when others reap all the benefit.  There ought to be conservators employed, to see that the fisheries  are properly regulated, and these should be paid by an assessment  on all the proprietors in proportion to the value of their  fisheries.    I should also recommend an extension and uniformity of close time  in all the rivers in the kingdom, for although it is an undoubted  fact that some clean fish are caught in the river early in the  season, yet they are comparatively few in number, and their  capture involves that of a far greater number of spawning and Kelt  fish, which are not only of no value for the table, but the  destruction of which is in effect the destruction of millions of  fish which would proceed from them. In the first Parl. Rep., p.  11, Mr. Walter Jamieson says, that in the river Tweed, from  January 10th to February 1st, he caught one hundred and twenty-one  fish, only one of which had spawned; from February 1st to March  1st he took forty-four fish, twenty-five of which had not spawned  --fifteen were Kelts and four were clean fish; from March 1st to  March 10th he took seventeen fish, seven of which had not spawned  (four of them on the 10th)--six were Kelts and one clean fish. Now  the close time varies in almost every river, and some have no  close time at all; thus in the Ribble the close time begins on  September 15th and ends on December 31st, and in the Hodder there  is no legal close time; but there is no practical difference  between them in this respect, every one thinking himself entitled  to kill all the fish he can, at all times of the year, in both of  them. The observance of the weekly close time, that is, opening a  passage for the fish from sunset on Saturday night to sunrise on  Monday morning, is a mere farce, even if it could not be evaded,  as it almost invariably is, for it is well known to every one  conversant with the habits of Salmon, that they only ascend the  rivers when there are freshes (floods) in them, and in summer the  ground is generally so dry, and vegetation absorbs so much  moisture, and the evaporation is so great, that it not only  requires twice as much rain to produce a flood in the river then  as it does in winter, but when the rain does come its effects are  only visible in the river for a short time. I have known a strong  fresh in the Ribble in the morning, and the river low again in the  afternoon of the same day. A fresh coming at the beginning of a  week, would disappear long before the close of it, unless the  rainy weather continued; and thus the strict observance of the  weekly close time would be of little service to the upper  proprietors unless the fresh came at the right end of the week.    The Smolts and the Par ought to be protected as strictly as the  Salmon; and there ought to be a penalty attached to the killing of  them, or having them in possession, and conservators of rivers  ought to have the power of inspecting all mills and manufactories  driven by those rivers, to ascertain that they have no contrivances  for taking the fry on their way to the sea, as it appears that in  some rivers they are taken in large quantities. There ought also to  be a penalty attached to the killing of Kelt fish, which in that  state are not only tasteless and insipid, but actually unwholesome;  yet they are pursued and destroyed with as much avidity as the fresh  fish, and a very small number of the few that spawn in safety ever  return to the sea. A penalty ought also to be inflicted for selling,  buying, using, or having in possession Salmon roe, either in a fresh  or salted state, as its excellence as a bait for Trout and Eels, and  the consequent high price at which it sells, are sufficient  temptations to poachers to kill the Salmon in the spawning season  even if they could not sell or use any other part. Yet destructive  as this practice is, there is an extensive trade in this article--  a fishing-tackle maker in Liverpool having told a friend of mine  that he sold 300 lbs. in a season, which, supposing every egg to  hatch, would produce perhaps five times as many Salmon as are caught  in one year throughout the whole kingdom. [4]    In concluding this imperfect sketch, I may remark that I have  omitted many things concerning the natural history and habits of  the Salmon, fearing to trespass too much on the patience of my  readers; but I have wished, in addition to communicating some  facts in the natural history of this fish, which I believe are not  generally known, to call the attention of the public to the  present state of the Salmon fisheries in England. Many of the  preceding observations are founded on the evidence of persons  connected with the fisheries in Scotland, and are perhaps no  longer applicable to that part of the kingdom, since there has  been an alteration in the laws; whether this is the case or not, I  have no present means of ascertaining. I shall be glad if any one  having a knowledge of the subject will say what benefit, if any,  has been derived from the alteration; however, it is sufficient  for my present purpose to show what is the state of things when  there are no laws on the subject, or, which is the same thing,  when there is no attention paid to them; a state of things which,  instead of promoting an abundant supply of these excellent fish,  and rendering the Salmon fisheries nationally important, tends by  the habitual disregard of the laws by one party, the selfishness  of another, and the neglect of a third, to render these fisheries  of little and decreasing value; whereas if the lower proprietors  would allow a tolerable supply of Salmon to come up the river when  they were worth taking, and the upper ones would preserve them  during close time, there would be plenty for each and for all.    I am aware it will be difficult to legislate upon this subject  without injury to what is of infinitely greater importance--I mean  the manufactories of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#4)"],[1,"few years ago.  \"No  mistake about HER, sir.\"    \"Ikey,\" said I, \"don't mention it; I have seen something in this  house.\"    \"No, sir?\" he whispered, greedily opening his eyes.  \"'Ooded lady,  sir?\"    \"Don't be frightened,\" said I.  \"It was a figure rather like you.\"    \"Lord, sir?\"    \"Ikey!\" said I, shaking hands with him warmly, I may say  affectionately; \"if there is any truth in these ghost-stories, the  greatest service I can do you, is, to fire at that figure.  And I  promise you, by Heaven and earth, I will do it with this gun if I  see it again!\"    The young man thanked me, and took his leave with some little  precipitation, after declining a glass of liquor.  I imparted my  secret to him, because I had never quite forgotten his throwing his  cap at the bell; because I had, on another occasion, noticed  something very like a fur cap, lying not far from the bell, one  night when it had burst out ringing; and because I had remarked  that we were at our ghostliest whenever he came up in the evening  to comfort the servants.  Let me do Ikey no injustice.  He was  afraid of the house, and believed in its being haunted; and yet he  would play false on the haunting side, so surely as he got an  opportunity. The Odd Girl's case was exactly similar.  She went  about the house in a state of real terror, and yet lied monstrously  and wilfully, and invented many of the alarms she spread, and made  many of the sounds we heard.  I had had my eye on the two, and I  know it.  It is not necessary for me, here, to account for this  preposterous state of mind; I content myself with remarking that it  is familiarly known to every intelligent man who has had fair  medical, legal, or other watchful experience; that it is as well  established and as common a state of mind as any with which  observers are acquainted; and that it is one of the first elements,  above all others, rationally to be suspected in, and strictly  looked for, and separated from, any question of this kind.    To return to our party.  The first thing we did when we were all  assembled, was, to draw lots for bedrooms.  That done, and every  bedroom, and, indeed, the whole house, having been minutely  examined by the whole body, we allotted the various household  duties, as if we had been on a gipsy party, or a yachting party, or  a hunting party, or were shipwrecked.  I then recounted the  floating rumors concerning the hooded lady, the owl, and Master B.:  with others, still more filmy, which had floated about during our  occupation, relative to some ridiculous old ghost of the female  gender who went up and down, carrying the ghost of a round table;  and also to an impalpable Jackass, whom nobody was ever able to  catch.  Some of these ideas I really believe our people below had  communicated to one another in some diseased way, without conveying  them in words.  We then gravely called one another to witness, that  we were not there to be deceived, or to deceive--which we  considered pretty much the same thing--and that, with a serious  sense of responsibility, we would be strictly true to one another,  and would strictly follow out the truth.  The understanding was  established, that any one who heard unusual noises in the night,  and who wished to trace them, should knock at my door; lastly, that  on Twelfth Night, the last night of holy Christmas, all our  individual experiences since that then present hour of our coming  together in the haunted house, should be brought to light for the  good of all; and that we would hold our peace on the subject till  then, unless on some remarkable provocation to break silence.    We were, in number and in character, as follows:    First--to get my sister and myself out of the way--there were we  two.  In the drawing of lots, my sister drew her own room, and I  drew Master B.'s.  Next, there was our first cousin John Herschel,  so called after the great astronomer: than whom I suppose a better  man at a telescope does not breathe.  With him, was his wife: a  charming creature to whom he had been married in the previous  spring.  I thought it (under the circumstances) rather imprudent to  bring her, because there is no knowing what even a false alarm may  do at such a time; but I suppose he knew his own business best, and  I must say that if she had been MY wife, I never could have left  her endearing and bright face behind.  They drew the Clock Room.  Alfred Starling, an uncommonly agreeable young fellow of eight-and-  twenty for whom I have the greatest liking, was in the Double Room;  mine, usually, and designated by that name from having a dressing-  room within it, with two large and cumbersome windows, which no  wedges I was ever able to make, would keep from shaking, in any  weather, wind or no wind.  Alfred is a young fellow who pretends to  be \"fast\" (another word for loose, as I understand the term), but  who is much too good and sensible for that nonsense, and who would  have distinguished himself before now, if his father had not  unfortunately left him a small independence of two hundred a year,  on the strength of which his only occupation in life has been to  spend six.  I am in hopes, however, that his Banker may break, or  that he may enter into some speculation guaranteed to pay twenty  per cent.; for, I am convinced that if he could only be ruined, his  fortune is made.  Belinda Bates, bosom friend of my sister, and a  most intellectual, amiable, and delightful girl, got the Picture  Room.  She has a fine genius for poetry, combined with real  business earnestness, and \"goes in\"--to use an expression of  Alfred's--for Woman's mission, Woman's rights, Woman's wrongs, and  everything that is woman's with a capital W, or is not and ought to  be, or is and ought not to be.  \"Most praiseworthy, my dear, and  Heaven prosper you!\" I whispered to her on the first night of my  taking leave of her at the Picture-Room door, \"but don't overdo it.  And in respect of the great necessity there is, my darling, for  more employments being within the reach of Woman than our  civilisation has as yet assigned to her, don't fly at the  unfortunate men, even those men who are at first sight in your way,  as if they were the natural oppressors of your sex; for, trust me,  Belinda, they do sometimes spend their wages among wives and  daughters, sisters, mothers, aunts, and grandmothers; and the play  is, really, not ALL Wolf and Red Riding-Hood, but has other parts  in it.\"  However, I digress.    Belinda, as I have mentioned, occupied the Picture Room.  We had  but three other chambers: the Corner Room, the Cupboard Room, and  the Garden Room.  My old friend, Jack Governor, \"slung his  hammock,\" as he called it, in the Corner Room.  I have always  regarded Jack as the finest-looking sailor that ever sailed.  He is  gray now, but as handsome as he was a quarter of a century ago--  nay, handsomer.  A portly, cheery, well-built figure of a broad-  shouldered man, with a frank smile, a brilliant dark eye, and a  rich dark eyebrow.  I remember those under darker hair, and they  look all the better for their silver setting.  He has been wherever  his Union namesake flies, has Jack, and I have met old shipmates of  his, away in the Mediterranean and on the other side of the  Atlantic, who have beamed and brightened at the casual mention of  his name, and have cried, \"You know Jack Governor?  Then you know a  prince of men!\"  That he is!  And so unmistakably a naval officer,  that if you were to meet him coming out of an Esquimaux snow-hut in  seal's skin, you would be vaguely persuaded he was in full naval  uniform.    Jack once had that bright clear eye of his on my sister; but, it  fell out that he married another lady and took her to South  America, where she died.  This was a dozen years ago or more.  He  brought down with him to our haunted house a little cask of salt  beef; for, he is always convinced that all salt beef not of his own  pickling, is mere carrion, and invariably, when he goes to London,  packs a piece in his portmanteau.  He had also volunteered to bring  with him one \"Nat Beaver,\" an old comrade of his, captain of a  merchantman.  Mr. Beaver, with a thick-set wooden face and figure,  and apparently as hard as a block all over, proved to be an  intelligent man, with a world of watery experiences in him, and  great practical knowledge.  At times, there was a curious  nervousness about him, apparently the lingering result of some old  illness; but, it seldom lasted many minutes.  He got the Cupboard  Room, and lay there next to Mr. Undery, my friend and solicitor:  who came down, in an amateur capacity, \"to go through with it,\" as  he said, and who plays whist better than the whole Law List, from  the red cover at the beginning to the red cover at the end.    I never was happier in my life, and I believe it was the universal  feeling among us.  Jack Governor, always a man of wonderful  resources, was Chief Cook, and made some of the best dishes I ever  ate, including unapproachable curries.  My sister was pastry cook  and confectioner.  Starling and I were Cook's Mate, turn and turn  about, and on special occasions the chief cook \"pressed\" Mr.  Beaver.  We had a great deal of outdoor sport and exercise, but  nothing was neglected within, and there was no ill-humor or  misunderstanding among us, and our evenings were so delightful that  we had at least one good reason for being reluctant to go to bed.    We had a few night alarms in the beginning.  On the first night, I  was knocked up by Jack with a most wonderful ship's lantern in his  hand, like the gills of some monster of the deep, who informed me  that he \"was going aloft to the main truck,\" to have the  weathercock down.  It was a stormy night and I remonstrated; but  Jack called my attention to its making a sound like a cry of  despair, and said somebody would be \"hailing a ghost\" presently, if  it wasn't done.  So, up to the top of the house,"]]]
