(#4)"],[1,"discontent arose chiefly from his  prejudices against the house of York which was generally beloved by  the nation, and which, for that very reason, became every day more  the object of his hatred and jealousy. Not only a preference on all  occasions, it was observed, was given to the Lancastrians, but many  of the opposite party had been exposed to great severity, and had been  bereaved of their fortunes by acts of attainder. A general resumption  likewise had passed of all grants made by the princes of the house of  York; and though this rigor had been covered under the pretence that the  revenue was become insufficient to support the dignity of the crown, and  though the grants during the later years of Henry VI. were resumed by  the same law, yet the York party, as they were the principal sufferers  by the resumption, thought it chiefly levelled against them. The  severity exercised against the earl of Warwick begat compassion for  youth and innocence exposed to such oppression; and his confinement in  the Tower, the very place where Edward's children had been murdered by  their uncle, made the public expect a like catastrophe for him, and led  them to make a comparison between Henry and that detested tyrant. And  when it was remarked that the queen herself met with harsh treatment,  and even after the birth of a son, was not admitted to the honor of  a public coronation, Henry's prepossessions were then concluded to be  inveterate, and men became equally obstinate in their disgust to his  government. Nor was the manner and address of the king calculated to  cure these prejudices contracted against his administration; but had  in every thing a tendency to promote fear, or at best reverence, rather  than good will and affection.[*] While the high idea entertained of  his policy and vigor retained the nobility and men of character in  obedience, the effects of his unpopular government soon appeared, by  incidents of an extraordinary nature.         * Bacon, p. 583.    There lived in Oxford one Richard Simon, a priest, who possessed  some subtlety, and still more enterprise and temerity. This man had  entertained the design of disturbing Henry's government, by raising a  pretender to his crown, and for that purpose he cast his eyes on Lambert  Simnel, a youth of fifteen years of age, who was son of a baker, and  who, being endowed with understanding above his years, and address  above his condition, seemed well fitted to personate a prince of royal  extraction. A report had been spread among the people, and received,  with great avidity, that Richard, duke of York, second son of Edward  IV., had, by a secret escape, saved himself from the cruelty of his  uncle, and lay somewhere concealed in England. Simon, taking advantage  of this rumor, had at first instructed his pupil to assume that name,  which he found to be so fondly cherished by the public: but hearing  afterwards a new report, that Warwick had made his escape from the  Tower, and observing that this news was attended with no less general  satisfaction, he changed the plan of his imposture, and made Simnel  personate that unfortunate prince.[*] Though the youth was qualified by  nature for the part which he was instructed to act, yet was it remarked,  that he was better informed in circumstances relating to the royal  family, particularly in the adventures of the earl of Warwick, than he  could be supposed to have learned from one of Simon's condition: and it  was thence conjectured, that persons of higher rank, partisans of the  house of York, had laid the plan of this conspiracy, and had conveyed  proper instructions to the actors. The queen dowager herself was exposed  to suspicion; and it was indeed the general opinion, however unlikely  it might seem, that she had secretly given her consent to the imposture.  This woman was of a very restless disposition. Finding that, instead  of receiving the reward of her services in contributing to Henry's  elevation, she herself was fallen into absolute insignificance, her  daughter treated with severity, and all her friends brought under  subjection, she had conceived the most violent animosity against him,  and had resolved to make him feel the effects of her resentment. She  knew that the impostor, however successful, might easily at last be  set aside; and if a way could be found at his risk to subvert the  government, she hoped that a scene might be opened, which, though  difficult at present exactly to foresee, would gratify her revenge, and  be on the whole less irksome to her than that slavery and contempt to  which she was now reduced.[**]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 569. 570.         ** Polyd. Virg. p. 570.    But whatever care Simon might take to convey instruction to his pupil  Simnel, he was sensible that the imposture would not bear a close  inspection; and he was therefore determined to open the first public  scene of it in Ireland. That island, which was zealously attached to  the house of York, and bore an affectionate regard to the memory  of Clarence, Warwick's father, who had been their lieutenant, was  improvidently allowed by Henry to remain in the same condition in  which he found it; and all the counsellors and officers, who had been  appointed by his predecessor, still retained their authority. No sooner  did Simnel present himself to Thomas Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare, the  deputy, and claim his protection as the unfortunate Warwick, than that  credulous nobleman, not suspecting so bold an imposture, gave attention  to him, and began to consult some persons of rank with regard to this  extraordinary incident. These he found even more sanguine in their zeal  and belief than himself: and in proportion as the story diffused itself  among those of lower condition, it became the object of still greater  passion and credulity, till the people in Dublin with one consent  tendered their allegiance to Simnel, as to the true Plantagenet. Fond of  a novelty which flattered their natural propension, they overlooked  the daughters of Edward IV., who stood before Warwick in the order  of succession; they paid the pretended prince attendance as their  sovereign, lodged him in the Castle of Dublin, crowned him with a diadem  taken from a statue of the Virgin, and publicly proclaimed him king, by  the appellation of Edward VI. The whole island followed the example of  the capital; and not a sword was any where drawn in Henry's quarrel.    When this intelligence was conveyed to the king, it reduced him to some  perplexity. Determined always to face his enemies in person, he yet  scrupled at present to leave England, where he suspected the conspiracy  was first framed, and where he knew many persons of condition, and the  people in general, were much disposed to give it countenance. In order  to dis cover the secret source of the contrivance, and take measures  against this open revolt, he held frequent consultations with his  ministers and counsellors, and laid plans for a vigorous defence of his  authority, and the suppression of his enemies.    The first event which followed these deliberations gave surprise to the  public; it was the seizure of the queen dowager the forfeiture of all  her lands and revenue, and the close confinement of her person in the  nunnery of Bermondsey. The act of authority was covered with a very thin  pretence. It was alleged that, notwithstanding the secret agreement to  marry her daughter to Henry, she had yet yielded to the solicitations  and menaces of Richard, and had delivered that princess and her sisters  into the hands of the tyrant. This crime, which was now become obsolete,  and might admit of alleviations, was therefore suspected not to be the  real cause of the severity with which she was treated; and men believed  that the king, unwilling to accuse so near a relation of a conspiracy  against him, had cloaked his vengeance or precaution under color of  an offence known to the whole world.[*] They were afterwards the more  confirmed in this suspicion, when they found that the unfortunate queen,  though she survived this disgrace several years, was never treated with  any more lenity, but was allowed to end her life in poverty, solitude,  and confinement.         * Bacon, p. 583, Polyd. Virg. p. 571.    The next measure of the king's was of a less exceptionable nature.  He ordered that Warwick should be taken from the Tower, be led in  procession through the streets of London, be conducted to St. Paul's,  and there exposed to the view of the whole people. He even gave  directions, that some men of rank, attached to the house of York, and  best acquainted with the person of this prince, should approach him and  converse with him: and he trusted that these, being convinced of the  absurd imposture of Simnel, would put a stop to the credulity of the  populace. The expedient had its effect in England: but in Ireland the  people still persisted in their revolt, and zealously retorted on the  king the reproach of propagating an imposture, and of having shown a  counterfeit Warwick to the public.    Henry had soon reason to apprehend, that the design against him was  not laid on such slight foundations as the absurdity of the contrivance  seemed to indicate. John, earl of Lincoln, son of John de la Pole, duke  of Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, eldest sister to Edward IV., was engaged  to take part in the conspiracy. This nobleman, who possessed capacity  and courage, had entertained very aspiring views; and his ambition was  encouraged by the known intentions of his uncle Richard, who had formed  a design, in case he himself should die without issue, of declaring  Lincoln successor to the crown. The king's jealousy against all eminent  persons of the York party, and his rigor towards Warwick, had further  struck Lincoln with apprehensions, and made him resolve to seek  for safety in the most dangerous counsels.

Camden, p. 371.         *** Camden, p. 378. Strype, vol. i. p. 150, 370.    While the queen and parliament were employed in settling the public  religion, the negotiations for a peace were still conducted, first at  Cercamp, then at Chateau-Cambresis, between the ministers of France,  Spain, and England; and Elizabeth, though equally prudent, was not  equally successful in this transaction. Philip employed his utmost  efforts to procure the restitution of Calais, both as bound in honor to  indemnify England which merely on his account had been drawn into the  war; and as engaged in interest to remove France to a distance from  his frontiers in the Low Countries. So long as he entertained hopes of  espousing the queen, he delayed concluding a peace with Henry; and even  after the change of religion in England deprived him of all such  views, his ministers hinted to her a proposal which may be regarded  as reasonable and honorable. Though all his own terms with France were  settled, he seemed willing to continue the war till she should obtain  satisfaction; provided she would stipulate to adhere to the Spanish  alliance, and continue hostilities against Henry during the course  of six years:[*]* but Elizabeth, after consulting with her ministers,  wisely rejected this proposal. She was sensible of the low state of her  finances; the great debts contracted by her father, brother, and sister;  the disorders introduced into every part of the administration; the  divisions by which her people were agitated; and she was convinced that  nothing but tranquillity during some years could bring the kingdom again  into a flourishing condition, or enable her to act with dignity and  vigor in her transactions with foreign nations. Well acquainted with  the value which Henry put upon Calais, and the impossibility, during the  present emergence, of recovering it by treaty, she was willing rather to  suffer that loss, than submit to such a dependence on Spain, as she  must expect to fall into, if she continued pertinaciously in her present  demand. She ordered, therefore, her ambassadors, Lord Effingham, the  bishop of Ely, and Dr. Wotton, to conclude the negotiation, and to  settle a peace with Henry on any reasonable terms. Henry offered to  stipulate a marriage between the eldest daughter of the dauphin, and the  eldest son of Elizabeth; and to engage for the restitution of Calais as  the dowry of that princess;[**] but as the queen was sensible that this  treaty would appear to the world a palpable evasion, she insisted upon  more equitable, at least more plausible conditions.         * Forbes's Full View, vol. i. p. 59.         ** Forbes's Full View, vol. i. p. 54.         It was at last agreed, that Henry should restore Calais at       the expiration of eight years; that in case of failure, he       should pay five hundred thousand crowns, and the queen's       title to Calais still remain; that he should find the       security of seven or eight foreign merchants, not natives of       France, for the payment of this sum; that he should deliver       five hostages till that security were provided; that if       Elizabeth broke the peace with France or Scotland during the       interval, she should forfeit all title to Calais; but if       Henry made war on Elizabeth, he should be obliged       immediately to restore that fortress.[*] All men of       penetration easily saw that these stipulations were but a       colorable pretence for abandoning Calais; but they excused       the queen on account of the necessity of her affairs; and       they even extolled her prudence in submitting without       further struggle to that necessity. A peace with Scotland       was a necessary consequence of that with France.         * Forbes, vol. i. p. 68. Rymer, tom. xv. p 505.    Philip and Henry terminated hostilities by a mutual restitution of  all places taken during the course of the war; and Philip espoused the  princess Elizabeth, eldest daughter of France, formerly betrothed to his  son Don Carlos. The duke of Savoy married Margaret, Henry's sister,  and obtained a restitution of all his dominions of Savoy and Piedmont,  except a few towns retained by France. And thus general tranquillity  seemed to be restored to Europe.    But though peace was concluded between France and England, there soon  appeared a ground of quarrel of the most serious nature, and which  was afterwards attended with the most important consequences. The two  marriages of Henry VIII., that with Catharine of Arragon, and that with  Anne Boleyn, were incompatible with each other; and it seemed impossible  that both of them could be regarded as valid and legal: but still the  birth of Elizabeth lay under some disadvantages to which that of her  sister Mary was not exposed. Henry's first marriage had obtained the  sanction of all the powers, both civil and ecclesiastical, which were  then acknowledged in England; and it was natural for Protestants as  well as Romanists to allow, on account of the sincere intention of the  parties, that their issue ought to be regarded as legitimate, But his  divorce and second marriage had been concluded in direct opposition to  the see of Rome; and though they had been ratified by the authority  both of the English parliament and convocation, those who were strongly  attached to the Catholic communion, and who reasoned with great  strictness were led to regard them as entirely invalid, and to deny  altogether the queen's right of succession. The next heir of blood was  the queen of Scots, now married to the dauphin; and the great power of  that princess, joined to her plausible title rendered her a formidable  rival to Elizabeth. The king of France had secretly been soliciting at  Rome a bull of excommunication against the queen; and she had here been  beholden to the good offices of Philip, who, from interest more than  either friendship or generosity, had negotiated in her favor, and had  successfully opposed the pretensions of Henry. But the court of France  was not discouraged with this repulse; the duke of Guise and his  brothers, thinking that it would much augment their credit if their  niece should bring an accession of England, as she had already done of  Scotland, to the crown of France, engaged the king not to neglect the  claim; and, by their persuasion, he ordered his son and daughter-in-law  to assume openly the arms as well as title of England, and to quarter  these arms on all their equipages, furniture, and liveries. When the  English ambassador complained of this injury he could obtain nothing  but an evasive answer; that as the queen of Scots was descended from  the blood royal of England, she was entitled, by the example of many  princes, to assume the arms of that kingdom. But besides that this  practice had never prevailed without permission being first obtained,  and without making a visible difference between the arms, Elizabeth  plainly saw that this pretension had not been advanced during the reign  of her sister Mary; and that, therefore, the king of France intended, on  the first opportunity, to dispute her legitimacy, and her title to  the crown. Alarmed at the danger, she thenceforth conceived a violent  jealousy against the queen of Scots; and was determined, as far as  possible, to incapacitate Henry from the execution of his project. The  sudden death of that monarch, who was killed in a tournament at Paris,  while celebrating the espousals of his sister with the duke of Savoy,  altered not her views. Being informed that his successor, Francis  II., still continued to assume, without reserve, the title of King of  England, she began to consider him and his queen as her mortal enemies;  and the present situation of affairs in Scotland afforded her a  favorable opportunity, both of revenging the injury, and providing for  her own safety.    The murder of the cardinal-primate at St. Andrew's had deprived the  Scottish Catholics of a head whose severity, courage, and capacity had  rendered him extremely formidable to the innovators in religion; and  the execution of the laws against heresy began thenceforth to be more  remiss. The queen regent governed the kingdom by prudent and moderate  counsels; and as she was not disposed to sacrifice the civil interests  of the state to the bigotry or interests of the clergy, she deemed  it more expedient to temporize, and to connive at the progress of a  doctrine which she had not power entirely to repress. When informed of  the death of Edward, and the accession of Mary to the crown of England,  she entertained hopes that the Scottish reformers, deprived of the  countenance which they received from that powerful kingdom, would lose  their ardor with their prospect of success, and would gradually return  to the faith of their ancestors. But the progress and revolutions of  religion are little governed by the usual maxims of civil policy; and  the event much disappointed the expectations of the regent. Many of the  English preachers, terrified with the severity of Mary's government,  took shelter in Scotland, where they found more protection, and a milder  administration; and while they propagated their theological tenets, they  filled the whole kingdom with a just horror against the cruelties of the  bigoted Catholics, and showed their disciples the fate which they  must expect, if ever their adversaries should attain an uncontrolled  authority over them.    A hierarchy, moderate in its acquisitions of power and riches, may  safely grant a toleration to sectaries; and the more it softens the zeal  of innovators by lenity and liberty, the more securely will it possess  those advantages which the legal establishments bestow upon it.
