As we  now emerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together, I  cast my eyes about, and truly my heart glowed within me and my spirits  rose at the beautiful prospect which I beheld on every side.  The gale  had suddenly died away, just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed  our ship upon the rocks, and had nothing more to do after accomplishing  that.  The island on which we stood was hilly, and covered almost  everywhere with the most beautiful and richly coloured trees, bushes,  and shrubs, none of which I knew the names of at that time--except,  indeed, the cocoa-nut palms, which I recognised at once from the many  pictures that I had seen of them before I left home.  A sandy beach of  dazzling whiteness lined this bright-green shore, and upon it there fell  a gentle ripple of the sea.  This last astonished me much, for I  recollected that at home the sea used to fall in huge billows on the  shore long after a storm had subsided.  But on casting my glance out to  sea the cause became apparent.  About a mile distant from the shore I  saw the great billows of the ocean rolling like a green wall, and  falling with a long, loud roar upon a low coral reef, where they were  dashed into white foam and flung up in clouds of spray.  This spray  sometimes flew exceedingly high, and every here and there a beautiful  rainbow was formed for a moment among the falling drops.  We afterwards  found that this coral reef extended quite round the island, and formed a  natural breakwater to it.  Beyond this, the sea rose and tossed  violently from the effects of the storm; but between the reef and the  shore it was as calm and as smooth as a pond.    My heart was filled with more delight than I can express at sight of so  many glorious objects, and my thoughts turned suddenly to the  contemplation of the Creator of them all.  I mention this the more  gladly, because at that time, I am ashamed to say, I very seldom thought  of my Creator, although I was constantly surrounded by the most  beautiful and wonderful of His works.  I observed, from the expression  of my companion's countenance, that he too derived much joy from the  splendid scenery, which was all the more agreeable to us after our long  voyage on the salt sea.  There the breeze was fresh and cold; but here  it was delightfully mild, and when a puff blew off the land it came  laden with the most exquisite perfume that can be imagined.  While we  thus gazed we were startled by a loud \"Huzza!\" from Peterkin, and on  looking towards the edge of the sea we saw him capering and jumping  about like a monkey, and ever and anon tugging with all his might at  something that lay upon the shore.    \"What an odd fellow he is, to be sure!\" said Jack, taking me by the arm  and hurrying forward.  \"Come, let us hasten to see what it is.\"    \"Here it is, boys--hurrah!  Come along!  Just what we want!\" cried  Peterkin as we drew near, still tugging with all his power.  \"First-rate; just the very ticket!\"    I need scarcely say to my readers that my companion Peterkin was in the  habit of using very remarkable and peculiar phrases.  And I am free to  confess that I did not well understand the meaning of some of them--  such, for instance, as \"the very ticket;\" but I think it my duty to  recount everything relating to my adventures with a strict regard to  truthfulness in as far as my memory serves me, so I write, as nearly as  possible, the exact words that my companions spoke.  I often asked  Peterkin to explain what he meant by \"ticket,\" but he always answered me  by going into fits of laughter.  However, by observing the occasions on  which he used it, I came to understand that it meant to show that  something was remarkably good or fortunate.    On coming up we found that Peterkin was vainly endeavouring to pull the  axe out of the oar into which, it will be remembered, Jack struck it  while endeavouring to cut away the cordage among which it had become  entangled at the bow of the ship.  Fortunately for us, the axe had  remained fast in the oar, and even now all Peterkin's strength could not  draw it out of the cut.    \"Ah, that is capital indeed!\" cried Jack, at the same time giving the  axe a wrench that plucked it out of the tough wood.  \"How fortunate this  is!  It will be of more value to us than a hundred knives, and the edge  is quite new and sharp.\"    \"I'll answer for the toughness of the handle, at any rate!\" cried  Peterkin; \"my arms are nearly pulled out of the sockets.  But see here,  our luck is great.  There is iron on the blade.\"  He pointed to a piece  of hoop-iron as he spoke, which had been nailed round the blade of the  oar to prevent it from splitting.    This also was a fortunate discovery.  Jack went down on his knees, and  with the edge of the axe began carefully to force out the nails.  But as  they were firmly fixed in, and the operation blunted our axe, we carried  the oar up with us to the place where we had left the rest of our  things, intending to burn the wood away from the iron at a more  convenient time.    \"Now, lads,\" said Jack after we had laid it on the stone which contained  our little all, \"I propose that we should go to the tail of the island,  where the ship struck, which is only a quarter of a mile off; and see if  anything else has been thrown ashore.  I don't expect anything, but it  is well to see.  When we get back here it will be time to have our  supper and prepare our beds.\"    \"Agreed!\" cried Peterkin and I together, as, indeed, we would have  agreed to any proposal that Jack made; for, besides his being older and  much stronger and taller than either of us, he was a very clever fellow,  and, I think, would have induced people much older than himself to  choose him for their leader, especially if they required to be led on a  bold enterprise.    Now as we hastened along the white beach, which shone so brightly in the  rays of the setting sun that our eyes were quite dazzled by its glare,  it suddenly came into Peterkin's head that we had nothing to eat except  the wild berries which grew in profusion at our feet.    \"What shall we do, Jack?\" said he with a rueful look.  \"Perhaps they may  be poisonous!\"    \"No fear,\" replied Jack confidently.  \"I have observed that a few of  them are not unlike some of the berries that grow wild on our own native  hills.  Besides, I saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few  minutes ago, and what won't kill the birds won't kill us.  But look up  there, Peterkin,\" continued Jack, pointing to the branched head of a  cocoa-nut palm.  \"There are nuts for us in all stages.\"    \"So there are!\" cried Peterkin, who, being of a very unobservant nature,  had been too much taken up with other things to notice anything so high  above his head as the fruit of a palm-tree.  But whatever faults my  young comrade had, he could not be blamed for want of activity or animal  spirits.  Indeed, the nuts had scarcely been pointed out to him when he  bounded up the tall stem of the tree like a squirrel, and in a few  minutes returned with three nuts, each as large as a man's fist.    \"You had better keep them till we return,\" said Jack.  \"Let us finish  our work before eating.\"    \"So be it, captain; go ahead!\" cried Peterkin, thrusting the nuts into  his trousers pocket.  \"In fact, I don't want to eat just now; but I  would give a good deal for a drink.  Oh, that I could find a spring! but  I don't see the smallest sign of one hereabouts.  I say, Jack, how does  it happen that you seem to be up to everything?  You have told us the  names of half-a-dozen trees already, and yet you say that you were never  in the South Seas before.\"    \"I'm not up to everything, Peterkin, as you'll find out ere long,\"  replied Jack with a smile; \"but I have been a great reader of books of  travel and adventure all my life, and that has put me up to a good many  things that you are, perhaps, not acquainted with.\"    \"Oh, Jack, that's all humbug!  If you begin to lay everything to the  credit of books, I'll quite lose my opinion of you,\" cried Peterkin with  a look of contempt.  \"I've seen a lot o' fellows that were _always_  poring over books, and when they came to try to _do_ anything, they were  no better than baboons!\"    \"You are quite right,\" retorted Jack; \"and I have seen a lot of fellows,  who never looked into books at all, who knew nothing about anything  except the things they had actually seen, and very little they knew even  about these.  Indeed, some were so ignorant that they did not know that  cocoa-nuts grew on cocoa-nut trees!\"    I could not refrain from laughing at this rebuke, for there was much  truth in it as to Peterkin's ignorance.    \"Humph! maybe you're right,\" answered Peterkin; \"but I would not give  _tuppence_ for a man of books if he had nothing else in him.\"    \"Neither would I,\" said Jack; \"but that's no reason why you should run  books down, or think less of me for having read them.  Suppose, now,  Peterkin, that you wanted to build a ship, and I were to give you a long  and particular account of the way to do it, would not that be very  useful?\"    \"No doubt of it,\" said Peterkin, laughing.    \"And suppose I were to write the account in a letter instead of telling  you in words, would that be less useful?\"    \"Well--no, perhaps not.\"    \"Well, suppose I were to print it and send it to you in the form of a  book, would it not be as good and useful as ever?\"    \"Oh, bother!  Jack, you're a philosopher, and that's worse than  anything!\" cried Peterkin with a look of pretended horror.    \"Very well, Peterkin, we shall see,\" returned Jack, halting under the  shade of a cocoa-nut tree.  \"You said you were thirsty just a minute  ago.  Now jump up that tree and bring down a nut--not a ripe one; bring  a green, unripe one.\"    Peterkin looked surprised, but seeing that Jack was in earnest, he  obeyed.    \"Now cut a hole in it with your penknife and clap it to your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#4)"],[1,"-----------------  Caprin     | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{10}H_{19}O)_{3}     |     Do.  do.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Laurin     | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{12}H_{23}O)_{3}     |     Do.  do.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Myristin   | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{14}H_{27}O)_{3}     |   Nutmeg butter  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Palmitin   | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{16}H_{31}O)_{3}     |   Palm oil, lard  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Stearin    | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{18}H_{35}O)_{3}     |   Tallow, lard,             |                                     |   cacao butter  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Olein      | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{18}H_{33}O)_{3}     |   Olive and             |                                     |   almond oils  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Ricinolein | C_{3}H_{5}(O.C_{18}H_{33}O_{2})_{3} |   Castor oil  ---------------------------------------------------------------------    ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Glyceride.  |   Melting        | Refractive          |  Saponification              |  Point, deg.C.   | Index at 60 deg.

The presence of stearin and  palmitin, which are solid at the ordinary temperature, gives firmness to  a fat; the greater the percentage present, the harder the fat and the  higher will be the melting point, hence tallows and palm oils are solid,  firm fats. Where olein, which is liquid, is the chief constituent, we  have softer fats, such as lard, and liquid oils, as almond, olive and  cotton-seed.    _Stearin_ (Tristearin) can be prepared from tallow by crystallisation  from a solution in ether, forming small crystals which have a bright  pearly lustre. The melting point of stearin appears to undergo changes  and suggests the existence of distinct modifications. When heated to 55 deg.  C. stearin liquefies; with increase of temperature it becomes solid, and  again becomes liquid at 71.6 deg. C. If this liquid be further heated to 76 deg.  C., and allowed to cool, it will not solidify until 55 deg. C. is reached,  but if the liquid at 71.6 deg. C. be allowed to cool, solidification will  occur at 70 deg. C.    _Palmitin_ (Tripalmitin) may be obtained by heating together palmitic  acid and glycerol, repeatedly boiling the resulting product with strong  alcohol, and allowing it to crystallise. Palmitin exists in scales,  which have a peculiar pearly appearance, and are greasy to the touch.  After melting and solidifying, palmitin shows no crystalline fracture;  when heated to 46 deg. C. it melts to a liquid which becomes solid on  further heating, again liquefying when 61.7 deg. C. is reached, and becoming  cloudy, with separation of crystalline particles. At 63 deg. C. it is quite  clear, and this temperature is taken as the true melting point. It has  been suggested that the different changes at the temperatures mentioned  are due to varying manipulation, such as rate at which the temperature  is raised, and the initial temperature of the mass when previously cool.    _Olein_ (Triolein) is an odourless, colourless, tasteless oil, which  rapidly absorbs oxygen and becomes rancid. It has been prepared  synthetically by heating glycerol and oleic acid together, and may be  obtained by submitting olive oil to a low temperature for several days,  when the liquid portion may be further deprived of any traces of stearin  and palmitin by dissolving in alcohol. Olein may be distilled _in vacuo_  without decomposition taking place.    _Laurin_ (Trilaurin) may be prepared synthetically from glycerol and  lauric acid. It crystallises in needles, melting at 45 deg.-46 deg. C., which  are readily soluble in ether, but only slightly so in cold absolute  alcohol. Scheij gives its specific gravity, _d_60 deg./4 deg. = 0.8944. Laurin  is the chief constituent of palm-kernel oil, and also one of the  principal components of cocoa-nut oil.    _Fatty Acids._--When a fat or oil is saponified with soda or potash, the  resulting soap dissolved in hot water, and sufficient dilute sulphuric  acid added to decompose the soap, an oily layer gradually rises to the  surface of the liquid, which, after clarifying by warming and washing  free from mineral acid, is soluble in alcohol and reddens blue litmus  paper. This oily layer consists of the \"fatty acids\" or rather those  insoluble in water, acids like acetic, propionic, butyric, caproic,  caprylic and capric, which are all more or less readily soluble in  water, remaining for the most part dissolved in the aqueous portion. All  the acids naturally present in oils and fats, whether free or combined,  are monobasic in character, that is to say, contain only one  carboxyl--CO.OH group. The more important fatty acids may be classified  according to their chemical constitution into five homologous series,  having the general formulae:--                I. Stearic series     C_{n}H_{2n+1}COOH             II. Oleic series       C_{n}H_{2n-1}COOH            III. Linolic series     C_{n}H_{2n-3}COOH             IV. Linolenic series   C_{n}H_{2n-5}COOH              V. Ricinoleic series  C_{n}H_{2n-7}COOH    I. _Stearic Series._--The principal acids of this series, together with  their melting points and chief sources, are given in the following  table:--    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Acid.          | Formula.          | Melting | Found in                 |                   | Point,  |                 |                   |  deg.C. |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Acetic         | CH_{3}COOH        | 17      | Macassar oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Butyric        | C_{3}H_{7}COOH    |  ...    | Butter, Macassar oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Isovaleric     | C_{4}H_{9}COOH    |  ...    | Porpoise and dolphin oils.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Caproic        | C_{5}H_{11}COOH   |  ...    | Butter, cocoa-nut oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Caprylic       | C_{7}H_{15}COOH   | 15      | Butter, cocoa-nut oil,                 |                   |         | Limburg cheese.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Capric         | C_{9}H_{19}COOH   | 30      | Butter, cocoa-nut oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lauric         | C_{11}H_{23}COOH  | 44      | Cocoa-nut oil, palm-kernel oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Ficocerylic    | C_{12}H_{25}COOH  |   ...   | Pisang wax.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Myristic       | C_{13}H_{27}COOH  | 54      | Nutmeg butter, liver fat,                 |                   |         | cocoa-nut oil, dika fat,                 |                   |         | croton oil.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Palmitic       | C_{15}H_{31}COOH  | 62.5    | Palm oil, most animal fats.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Daturic        | C_{16}H_{33}COOH  |         | Oil of Datura Stramonium.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Stearic        | C_{17}H_{35}COOH  | 69      | Tallow, lard, most solid                 |                   |         | animal fats.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Arachidic      | C_{19}H_{39}COOH  | 75      | Arachis or earth-nut oil,                 |                   |         | rape and mustard-seed oils.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Behenic        | C_{21}H_{43}COOH  |  ...    | Ben oil, black mustard-seed                 |                   |         | oil, rape oil.  --"]]]
