He was never drawn out of the highroad of art by the minuter and more  entangling allurements of scholarship. In one of his Divorce pamphlets he  tells, with the inevitable touch of pride, how he never could delight in  long citations, much less in whole traductions, \"whether it be natural  disposition or education in me, or that my mother bore me a speaker of  what God made mine own, and not a translator.\"    Milton was intended by his family, and by his own early resolves, for the  service of the Church. The growing unrest, therefore, in matters  ecclesiastical during the early part of the seventeenth century could not  but affect him. The various parties and tendencies in the Church of  England had never, since the Reformation, attained to a condition of  stable equilibrium. But the settlement under Elizabeth was strengthened,  and the parties bound together for thirty years, by the ever-present fear  of Rome. When that fear was allayed, and the menace that hung over the  very existence of the nation removed by the defeat of the Armada, the  differences within the Church broke out afresh, and waxed fiercer every  year. Shakespeare grew to manhood during the halcyon years between the  Marian persecutions and the Marprelate pamphlets--a kind of magic oasis,  which gave us our English Renaissance. Milton's youth breathed a very  different air. The Church, as it was, pleased hardly any party. Much of  the old temple had been hastily pulled down; the new government offices  that were to replace it had as yet been but partially built, and  commanded no general approval. Considered as a social organisation,  moreover, the Church throughout large parts of the country had fallen  into a state not unlike decay. Richard Baxter, whose testimony there is  no sufficient reason to reject, tells of its state in Shropshire during  the years of his youth, from 1615 onwards:--\"We lived in a country that  had but little preaching at all: In the Village where I was born there  was four Readers successively in Six years time, ignorant Men, and two of  them immoral in their lives; who were all my School-masters. In the  Village where my Father lived, there was a Reader of about Eighty years  of Age that never preached, and had two Churches about Twenty miles  distant: His Eyesight failing him, he said Common-Prayer without Book;  but for the Reading of the Psalms and Chapters he got a Common Thresher  and Day-Labourer one year, and a Taylor another year: (for the Clerk  could not read well): And at last he had a Kinsman of his own (the  excellentest Stage-player in all the Country, and a good Gamester and  good Fellow) that got Orders and supplied one of his Places.... After him  another Neighbour's Son took Orders, when he had been a while an  Attorney's Clerk, and a common Drunkard, and tipled himself into so great  Poverty that he had no other way to live.... These were the  School-masters of my Youth ... who read Common Prayer on Sundays and Holy  Days, and taught School and tipled on the Weekdays, and whipt the Boys  when they were drunk, so that we changed them very oft. Within a few  miles about us were near a dozen more Ministers that were near Eighty  years old apiece, and never preached; poor ignorant Readers, and most of  them of Scandalous Lives.\" Some few there were, Baxter admits, who  preached in the neighbourhood, but any one who went to hear them \"was  made the Derision of the Vulgar Rabble under the odious Name of a  _Puritane_.\"    In one of his Latin letters written from Cambridge, Milton himself speaks  of the ignorance of those designed for the profession of divinity, how  they knew little or nothing of literature and philosophy. The high  prelacy and ritualism of Laud on the one hand, the Puritan movement on  the other, each in some measure a protest against this state of things,  were at fierce variance with each other, and Milton's ear, from his youth  upward, was \"pealed with noises loud and ruinous.\" The age of Shakespeare  was irrecoverably past, and it was impossible for any but a few  imperturbable Cyrenaics, like Herrick, to \"fleet the time carelessly, as  they did in the golden world.\" The large indifference of Shakespeare to  current politics was impossible for Milton. \"I had as lief be a Brownist  as a politician,\" said the folly of Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the wisdom  of Shakespeare. But now the Brownists and the politicians had it their  own way; and Milton was something of both.    His notable early poems, written at College and during his retreat in  Buckinghamshire, have therefore a singular interest and pathos. He was  not long for the world in which these poems move with so ineffable a  native grace. They are the poems of his youth, instinct with the  sensibility of youth, and of a delicate and richly nurtured imagination.  But they are also the poems of an age that was closing, and they have a  touch of the sadness of evening. \"I know not,\" says Dr. Johnson, speaking  of _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, \"whether the characters are kept  sufficiently apart. No mirth can indeed be found in his melancholy, but I  am afraid that I always meet some melancholy in his mirth.\" It is true;  for both characters are Milton himself, who embodies in separate poems  the cheerful and pensive elements of his own nature--and already his  choice is made. There is something disinterested and detached about his  sketches of the merriment which he takes part in only as a silent  onlooker, compared with the profound sincerity of the lines--      And may at last my weary age    Find out the peaceful hermitage,    The hairy gown and mossy cell,    Where I may sit and rightly spell    Of every star that heaven doth shew,    And every herb that sips the dew,    Till old experience do attain    To something like prophetic strain.    The rising tide of political passion submerged the solemn Arcadia of his  early fancies. Like Lycidas, he was carried far from the flowers and the  shepherds to visit \"the bottom of the monstrous world.\" Hence there may  be made a whole index of themes, touched on by Milton in his early poems,  as if in promise, of which no fulfilment is to be found in the greater  poems of his maturity. His political career under the Commonwealth is  often treated, both by those who applaud and by those who lament it, as  if it were the merest interlude between two poetic periods. It was not  so; political passion dominates and informs all his later poems,  dictating even their subjects. How was it possible for him to choose King  Arthur and his Round Table for the subject of his epic, as he had  intended in his youthful days; when chivalry and the spirit of chivalry  had fought its last fight on English soil, full in the sight of all men,  round the forlorn banner of King Charles? The policy of Laud and  Stratford kept Milton out of the Church, and sent him into retirement at  Horton; the same policy, it may be plausibly conjectured, had something  to do with the change in the subject of his long-meditated epic. From the  very beginning of the civil troubles contemporary events leave their mark  on all his writings. The topical bias (so to call it) is very noticeable  in many of the subjects tentatively jotted down by him on the paper that  is now in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. The corrupted  clergy, who make so splendid and, as some think, so irrelevant an  appearance in _Lycidas_, figure frequently, either directly or by  implication, in the long list of themes.    Without misgiving or regret, when the time came, Milton shut the gate on  the sequestered paradise of his youth, and hastened downward to join the  fighters in the plain. Before we follow him we may well \"interpose a  little ease\" by looking at some of the beauties proper to the earlier  poems, and listening to some of the simple pastoral melodies that were  drowned when the organ began to blow. _L'Allegro_ is full of them--      Sometimes, with secure delight,    The upland hamlets will invite,    When the merry bells ring round,    And the jocund rebecks sound    To many a youth and many a maid    Dancing in the chequered shade,    And young and old come forth to play    On a sunshine holiday.    That is Merry England of Shakespeare's time. But already the controversy  concerning the _Book of Sports_ had begun to darken the air. Already the  Maypole, that \"great stinking idol,\" as an Elizabethan Puritan called it,  had been doomed to destruction. Some years before _L'Allegro_ was  written, a bard, who hailed from Leeds, had lamented its downfall in the  country of his nativity--      Happy the age, and harmelesse were the dayes,      (For then true love and amity was found)    When every village did a May-pole raise,      And Whitson Ales and May games did abound;    And all the lusty Yonkers in a rout    With merry Lasses danced the rod about;    Then friendship to their banquets bid the guests,    And poor men far'd the better for their feasts.    The next verse recalls that scene in _The Winter's Tale_ where  Shakespeare draws a vivid picture of Elizabethan country merrymaking--      The Lords of Castles, Manners, Townes, and Towers      Rejoyc'd when they beheld the Farmers flourish,    And would come down unto the Summer-Bowers      To see the Country gallants dance the Morrice,    And sometimes with his tenant's handsome daughter    Would fall in liking, and espouse her after    Unto his Serving-man, and for her portion    Bestow on him some farme, without extortion.

Adversity may be a hard task-mistress, but she is an  excellent teacher in the school of life, and their Spartan upbringing  had given the Gascoynes a certain resourcefulness and grit of  character that they might possibly have lacked in more affluent  surroundings. They were not a perfect family by any means, and had  their squabbles and their cross moods like many another; but on the  whole they were ready to give and take, make sacrifices for each  other, and to try day by day to live a little nearer to that wonderful  high standard that Father ever set before them, and which he himself  followed so faithfully and truly.          CHAPTER III    A False Step      The morning following Gwen's promotion to the Fifth Form was wet, one  of those hopelessly wet October days when the grey sky and the  dripping trees and the sodden grass and the draggled flowers all seem  to combine to remind us that summer, lovely, gracious summer, has gone  with the swallows and left her fickle stepsister autumn in her stead.  It had been raining heavily all night, and it was pouring hard when  Nellie placed the coffee pot and the porridge on the table and rang  the breakfast bell.    \"It's an atrocious, abominable morning!\" grunted Gwen, peering  disconsolately through the window into the damp garden. \"It's sheer  cruelty to be expected to turn out and tramp two miles through the  mud. We oughtn't to have to go to school when it rains.\"    \"Wet at seven, fine at eleven!\" chirped Beatrice at the coffee pot.    \"It's all very well for you to be cheerful and quote proverbs--you  haven't to go out yourself, Madam Bee!\" grumbled Gwen. \"I wonder how  you'd like it if--\"    \"Oh, Gwen, don't whine! Come and get breakfast,\" interrupted Winnie.  \"It's five-and-twenty to eight, and I've a strong suspicion the  clock's late.\"    \"It is,\" remarked Lesbia calmly, pausing with her porridge spoon  suspended midway between plate and mouth. \"Stumps put it back ten  minutes last night when Father wasn't looking. I saw him.\"    A chorus of united indignation followed her information, each member  of the family trying to bolt breakfast and scold the offender at the  same time.    \"We've only five minutes. Oh, you naughty boy!\" shrieked Winnie.    \"I didn't want to go to bed--I meant to put it on again this morning  first thing--I did, honest,\" protested Giles, otherwise known as  \"Stumps\".    \"Lesbia, why couldn't you say sooner?\" fretted Gwen.    \"Only just remembered.\"    \"And the porridge is so hot I've burned my mouth!\" wailed Basil.    \"You haven't a moment to waste!\" urged Beatrice. \"Have you all got  your boots on? I shall tell Father what you've done, Giles, as soon as  he comes downstairs.\"    Even the loss of ten minutes was a serious consideration to those  members of the Gascoyne family who were bound for school. Skelwick was  such an out-of-the-way place that they had quite a journey to get to  Stedburgh, the seaside town where Rodenhurst was situated. First they  had to walk two miles along a very exposed country road to the village  of North Ditton, where they could catch the motor omnibus that would  take them the remaining four miles into Stedburgh, and then there was  a further walk of at least ten minutes before they reached the school.  The bus always started with the utmost promptitude, so it was a daily  anxiety to leave home punctually and not be obliged to run the last  half mile. On this particular morning there was more than the usual  scramble to get off. At the last moment Gwen could not find her  galoshes, and remembered that she had broken the rib of her umbrella  some days before, and had forgotten to mention the fact and ask  Beatrice to have it mended.    \"You're the most tiresome girl!\" scolded the harassed elder sister.  \"Why couldn't you tell me and I'd have sent it to Johnson's last  night? Now I suppose I shall have to lend you mine, and very likely  you'll go and break that too!\"    \"I don't want yours!\" snapped Gwen, tucking her hair inside her  mackintosh and putting on her \"stormy-weather\" cap. \"I wouldn't risk  smashing it for a five-pound note. I'll go without!\" and snatching her  satchel of books she rushed after the others, who had already started.    The rain was driving furiously, and the road was full of little  running rivers of yellow mud. The strong wind made Gwen's eyes smart  and water, and she was obliged to hurry to make up for lost time; so  when she arrived at North Ditton she was a breathless, rather pitiful  object, and most decidedly cross. The omnibus was so full that she was  compelled to take Lesbia on her knee and to sit wedged between a very  fat wheezy old farmer and a market gardener, who nursed a parcel of  plants.    \"It's rather fun, isn't it?\" laughed Lesbia, graciously accepting the  rose that her neighbour offered her. (Somehow people always gave  things to Lesbia.)    \"More fun for you than for me!\" growled Gwen. \"I wish you knew how  heavy you are!\"    A bad start does not make a good preparation for the rest of the day,  and Gwen marched into the Fifth Form room that morning in no  conciliatory frame of mind. She was quite prepared to be ill received,  so she thought she would meet possible coldness by showing a defiant  attitude. It was an extremely foolish move, for it brought about the  very state of affairs she anticipated. Several of the nicer girls in  the Form had half repented their wrath of yesterday, and were ready  not only to treat her kindly, but to influence the others in her  favour. When they saw her enter, however, with a \"don't care\" scowling  air and walk to her desk, without even looking in their direction,  they decided that she was an ill-conditioned, disagreeable girl, and  that they would not trouble their heads about her. Instead, therefore,  of going and speaking to her as they had intended, they let her  severely alone. As a rule, if we go through life expecting slights and  dislike, we get what we look for: the self-made martyr can find stake  and faggots waiting round every corner. Gwen raged inwardly at the  neglect of her classmates, but she did not realize in the least that  it was partly her own fault. She sat all the morning with a  thundercloud on her face, hurrying out of the room at the interval and  eating her lunch alone in a corner of the gymnasium.    \"How are you getting on in the Fifth?\" whispered Lesbia, who ran up  for a moment to sympathize.    \"Badly,\" groaned Gwen. \"They're boycotting me. Of course the Fourth  won't have anything to do with me now; so I'm like Mahomet's coffin,  swung between heaven and earth! It's not pleasant, I assure you.\"    \"I should think not. I wish I could do anything.\"    \"You can't. Go back and play basket-ball.\"    It was not Rodenhurst etiquette for Seniors to talk to Juniors, so  Gwen, mindful even in her forlorn state of her new dignity as a member  of the Upper School, could not indulge in the luxury of a chat with  Lesbia. She wandered down the corridor, read the time sheets and the  announcements on the notice boards, peeped into several empty  classrooms, and was glad for once when the bell rang. At one o'clock  things were no better. She was given a new place at the dinner-table  and had to sit between Rachel Hunter and Edith Arnold, both of whom  behaved as if unaware of her presence, and talked to each other across  her as though she were non-existent. When she asked for the salt  (rather shortly, certainly) Edith only stared and did not pass it. By  the end of the meal Gwen began to feel the situation was getting on  her nerves. She had been fairly popular in the Upper Fourth, so the  change was the more unpleasant.    \"I'm not going to give in, though,\" she thought. \"I believe what they  want is to make me ask Miss Roscoe to move me down again. Well,  they'll find themselves mistaken, that's all! I'll stay in the Upper  School if nobody speaks to me till next midsummer, and if I have to  stop up half the night slogging away at my work!\"    \"How cross that Gwen Gascoyne looks!\" whispered Hilda Browne to Iris  Watson.    \"Yes, she doesn't seem to want to know us, does she?\"    \"She needn't, I'm sure. I think she's horrid!\"    It was still raining and impossible to go into the playground, so Gwen  strolled into the empty classroom, and for lack of anything else to do  began arranging and rearranging the contents of her desk. She had not  been there more than five minutes when the door opened and Netta  Goodwin, one of her new form-mates, entered, humming a tune. She  glanced at Gwen, went to her own desk, made a pretence of trying to  find a book, sat whistling for a moment or two, then finally turned  towards Gwen.    \"Well, how do you like being a Senior?\" she asked half mockingly.    \"Too soon to tell yet,\" replied Gwen cautiously. \"I shall know better  at the end of a week.\"    \"You've not had a very charming reception so far, have you? I saw how  Rachel and Edith were behaving at dinner.\"    \"I don't care!\" snapped Gwen. \"I don't want to talk to them, thanks!  The Form can please itself whether it's friendly or leaves me alone as  far as I'm concerned.\"    Netta whistled softly. There was a rather inscrutable expression on  her face.    \"All the same I suppose you don't always want to go on being a kind of  leper and outlaw? Not very interesting, I should say, to come to  school every day and speak to nobody!\"    Gwen was silent. She had no argument to advance.    \"They're annoyed with you just at present for being moved into our  Form, but they can't keep it up long. In a little while they'll feel  accustomed to you and you'll get on all right. Then the question is,  are you going to belong to the Saints or the Sinners?\"    \"What do you mean?\" asked Gwen.    \"We're all one or other here. We call Hilda Browne and Iris Watson and  Louise Mawson and Rachel Hunter"]]]
