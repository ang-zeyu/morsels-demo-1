They were always known as \"wild\" Indians, and indeed their early warfare  with all neighboring tribes, as well as their recent persistent hostility  toward our Government, which precipitated a \"war of extermination,\" bear  out the appropriateness of the designation. An admission of fear of  anything is hard to elicit from the weakest of Indian tribes, but all who  lived within raiding distance of the Apache, save the Navaho, their  Athapascan cousins, freely admit that for generations before their  subjugation the Apache were constantly held in mortal terror.    Through the constant depredations carried on against the Mexican  settlements in northern Sonora and Chihuahua, under the leadership of Juan  Jose, an Apache chief educated among the Mexicans, those two states were  led, in 1837, to offer a bounty for Apache scalps. The horror of this  policy lay in the fact that the scalp of a friendly Indian brought the  same reward as that of the fiercest warrior, and worse still, no exception  was made of women or children. Nothing could have been more effective than  this scalp bounty in arousing all the savagery in these untamed denizens  of the mountains, and both Mexico and the United States paid dearly in  lives for every Apache scalp taken under this barbarous system. Predatory  warfare continued unabated during the next forty years in spite of all the  Mexican government could do. With the consummation of the treaty of  Guadalupe Hidalgo, in 1848, the Apache problem became one to be solved by  the United States as well.    In 1864, under General James H. Carleton, the \"war of extermination\" was  begun in a most systematic manner. On April 20 this officer communicated a  proposal of co-operation to Don Ignacio Pesqueira, Governor of Sonora,  saying: \"If your excellency will put a few hundred men into the field on  the first day of next June, and keep them in hot pursuit of the Apaches of  Sonora, say for sixty or ninety days, we will either exterminate the  Indians or so diminish their numbers that they will cease their murdering  and robbing propensities and live at peace.\"    This request was met. The settlers in Arizona, under agreement, placed a  force in the field provisioned with army supplies. Several hundred Pima,  Papago, and Maricopa Indians also were supplied with guns, ammunition, and  clothing, and pressed into service; but a year's effort netted the  combined forces little gain. Although two hundred Apache were killed and  many head of stolen stock recovered, practically no advance toward the  termination of hostilities was accomplished.    In April, 1865, Inspector-General Davis arranged a conference at the  Copper Mines in New Mexico with Victorio, Nane, Acosta, and other chiefs,  among whom were Pasquin, Cassari, and Salvador, sons of Mangas Coloradas,  through which he learned of the existence of dire destitution among the  Apache and a desire for peace on condition that they be permitted to  occupy their native haunts. But the Government had adopted a policy of  removal by which the Arizona Apache desiring peace should join the  Mescaleros at the Bosque Redondo in New Mexico. To this they flatly  refused to agree, and the warfare continued.                    [Illustration: The Bathing Pool - Apache]                            The Bathing Pool - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1906 by E.S. Curtis_      Practically all the Apache were assembled in Arizona in 1865, and waged  hostilities with renewed energy for the next five years, being joined by  the Walapai in 1868. The close of this period found the situation quite as  unsettled as ever.    On June 4, 1871, General George Crook was placed in command. Crook was not  an exterminator. In the fall of the same year he said:    \"I think that the Apache is painted in darker colors than he deserves, and  that his villainies arise more from a misconception of facts than from his  being worse than other Indians. Living in a country the natural products  of which will not support him, he has either to cultivate the soil or  steal, and as our vacillating policy satisfies him we are afraid of him,  he chooses the latter, also as requiring less labor and being more  congenial to his natural instincts. I am satisfied that a sharp, active  campaign against him would not only make him one of the best Indians in  the country, but it would also save millions of dollars to the Treasury,  and the lives of many innocent whites and Indians.\"    Crook's policy was one of peace, but he made it plain to the Indians that  if they did not agree to peace when liberal terms were offered, they could  expect a campaign against them hitherto unequalled in vigor. It was thus  that by 1873 the Tontos, Coyoteros, and Apache-Mohave were subdued and the  backbone of Apache resistance broken.    The Apache-Mohave and the Tontos were placed on a reservation on the Rio  Verde; the Coyoteros were taken to the White Mountain district near Fort  Apache; the Pinalenos and parts of other bands surrendered and were  established at San Carlos; in all, approximately three thousand Apache had  been brought under control. About one thousand hostiles yet remained in  the mountains, but by 1874 they had become so nearly subjugated as to make  it seem advisable to transfer the Arizona reservations from the War  Department to the Office of Indian Affairs, which was done. The policy of  the Indian Office from the beginning had been to concentrate the various  bands upon one reservation at San Carlos. Disaffection arose between  different bands until this became a despicable place to nearly all, while  continued adherence to the removal policy drove the Chiricahua from their  southern Arizona reservation to seek refuge with the Ojo Caliente Apache  in southwestern New Mexico, in 1876, although they had been living in  comparative peace for four years. In 1877 these Chiricahua and the Ojo  Caliente band were forcibly removed to San Carlos, but while en route  Victorio and a party of forty warriors made their escape. In September of  the same year three hundred more fled from San Carlos and settler after  settler was murdered. In February, 1878, Victorio and his notorious band  surrendered at Ojo Caliente, but gave notice that they would die fighting  before submitting to removal to San Carlos. The major portion of the three  hundred Chiricahua who had left San Carlos surrendered at Fort Wingate,  New Mexico, shortly before. All these were taken to the Mescalero  reservation in New Mexico.    Haunted by the dread of removal to San Carlos, the appearance of a party  of Grant County officials at the Mescalero agency on a hunting tour a few  months later caused Victorio and his band to flee with a number of  Chiricahua and Mescaleros to the mountains of southern New Mexico.    For two years, until he met his death at the hands of Mexican troops in  the fall of 1880, Victorio spread carnage throughout the southern portions  of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and the northern states of Mexico,  enlisting the aid of every willing renegade or refugee of whatever band or  tribe in that section. After him Nane, Chato, Juh, Geronimo, and other  doughty hostiles carried the fighting and raiding along until June, 1883,  when Crook, reassigned to the Arizona district, followed the Chiricahua  band under Geronimo into the Sierra Madre in Chihuahua, whence he brought  them back whipped and ready to accept offers of peace. The captives were  placed upon the San Carlos and White Mountain reservations, where, with  the various other Apache bands under military surveillance, and with Crook  in control, they took up agriculture with alacrity. But in 1885 Crook's  authority was curtailed, and through some cause, never quite clear,  Geronimo with many Chiricahua followers again took the warpath. Crook  being relieved at his own request, Gen. Nelson A. Miles was assigned the  task of finally subduing the Apache, which was consummated by the  recapture of Geronimo and his band in the Sierra Madre in September, 1886.  These hostiles were taken as prisoners to Florida, later to Alabama, and  thence to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where, numbering 298, they still are,  living as farmers in peace and quiet, but still under the control of the  military authorities.                        [Illustration: _Alchise_ - Apache]                                _Alchise_ - Apache                 _From Copyright Photograph 1906 by E.S. Curtis_      One of the last hostile movements of note was the so-called Cibicu fight  in 1882. In the spring of that year an old medicine-man, Nabakelti,  Attacking The Enemy, better known as Doklini, started a \"medicine\" craze  in the valley of the Cibicu on the White Mountain reservation. He had  already a considerable following, and now claimed divine revelation and  dictated forms of procedure in bringing the dead to life. As medicine  paraphernalia he made sixty large wheels of wood, painted symbolically,  and twelve sacred sticks, one of which, in the form of a cross, he  designated \"chief of sticks.\" Then with sixty men he commenced his dance.    One morning at dawn Nabakelti went to the grave of a man who had been  prominent in the tribe and who had recently died. He and his adherents  danced about the grave and then dug up the bones, around which they danced  four times in a circle. The dancing occupied the entire morning, and early  in the afternoon they went to another grave, where the performance was  repeated. In each instance the bones were left exposed; but later four  men, specially delegated, went to the graves and erected a brush hut over  the remains.    Nabakelti told the people that they must pray each morning for four days,  at the end of which time the bleached bones would be found clothed with  flesh and alive again.
