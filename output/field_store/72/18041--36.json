It's 'The  Scorpion' case right enough. That bit of gold found on the dead man  is not a cactus stem; it's a scorpion's tail!\"    He put down the telephone and turned to Stuart, who had been listening  to the words with growing concern. Dunbar struck his open palm down  on to the table with a violent gesture.    \"We have been asleep!\" he exclaimed. \"Gaston Max of the Paris Service  has been at work in London for a month, and we didn't know it!\"    \"Gaston Max!\" cried Start--\"then it must be a big case indeed.\"    As a student of criminology the name of the celebrated Frenchman was  familiar to him as that of the foremost criminal investigator in  Europe, and he found himself staring at the fragment of gold with a new  and keener interest.    \"Poor chap,\" continued Dunbar--\"it was his last. The body brought in  from Hanover Hole has been identified as his.\"    \"What! it is the body of Gaston Max!\"    \"Paris has just wired that Max's reports ceased over a week ago. He  was working on the case of Sir Frank Narcombe, it seems, and I never  knew! But I predicted a long time ago that Max would play the  lone-hand game once too often. They sent particulars. The  identification disk is his. Oh! there's no doubt about it,  unfortunately. The dead man's face is unrecognizable, but it's not  likely there are two disks of that sort bearing the initials G.M. and  the number 49685. I'm going along now. Should you care to come,  doctor?\"    \"I am expecting a patient, Inspector,\" replied Stuart--\"er--a special  case. But I hope you will keep me in touch with this affair?\"    \"Well, I shouldn't have suggested your coming to the Yard if I hadn't  wanted to do that. As a matter of fact, this scorpion job seems to  resolve itself into a case of elaborate assassination by means of  some unknown poison; and although I should have come to see you in  any event, because you have helped me more than once, I came to-night  at the suggestion of the Commissioner. He instructed me to retain  your services if they were available.\"    \"I am honoured,\" replied Stuart. \"But after all, Inspector, I am  merely an ordinary suburban practitioner. My reputation has yet to  be made. What's the matter with Halesowen of Upper Wimpole Street?  He's the big man.\"    \"And if Sir Frank Narcombe was really poisoned--as Paris seems to  think he was--he's also a big fool.\" retorted Dunbar bluntly. \"He  agreed that death was due to heart trouble.\"    \"I know he did; unsuspected ulcerative endocarditis. Perhaps he was  right.\"    \"If he was right,\" said Dunbar, taking up the piece of gold from the  table, \"what was Gaston Max doing with this thing in his possession?\"    \"There may be no earthly connection between Max's inquiries and the  death of Sir Frank.\"    \"On the other hand--there may! Leaving Dr. Halesowen out of the  question, are you open to act as expert adviser in this case?\"    \"Certainly; delighted.\"    \"Your fee is your own affair, doctor. I will communicate with you  later, if you wish, or call again in the morning.\"    Dunbar wrapped up the scorpion's tail in the piece of tissue paper  and was about to replace it in his note-case. Then:    \"I'll leave this with you, doctor,\" he said. \"I know it will be safe  enough, and you might like to examine it at greater leisure.\"    \"Very well,\" replied Stuart. \"Some of the engraving is very minute.  I will have a look at it through a glass later.\"    He took the fragment from Dunbar, who had again unwrapped it, and,  opening a drawer of the writing-table in which he kept his cheque-book  and some few other personal valuables, he placed the curious piece of  gold-work within and relocked the drawer.    \"I will walk as far as the cab-rank with you,\" he said, finding  himself to be possessed of a spirit of unrest. Whereupon the two went  out of the room, Stuart extinguishing the lamps as he came to the  door.    They had not left the study for more than two minutes ere a car drew  up outside the house, and Mrs. M'Gregor ushered a lady into the room  but lately quitted by Stuart and Dunbar, turning up the lights as she  entered.    \"The doctor has gone out but just now, Miss Dorian,\" she said stiffly.  \"I am sorry that ye are so unfortunate in your veesits. But I know  he'll be no more than a few minutes.\"    The girl addressed was of a type fully to account for the misgivings  of the shrewd old Scotswoman. She had the slim beauty of the East  allied to the elegance of the West. Her features, whilst cast in a  charming European mould, at the same time suggested in some subtle  way the Oriental. She had the long, almond-shaped eyes of the Egyptian,  and her hair, which she wore unconventionally in a picturesque  fashion reminiscent of the _harem_, was inclined to be \"fuzzy,\" but  gleamed with coppery tints where the light touched its waves.    She wore a cloak of purple velvet having a hooded collar of white fox  fur; it fastened with golden cords. Beneath it was a white and gold  robe, cut with classic simplicity of line and confined at the waist  by an ornate Eastern girdle. White stockings and dull gold shoes  exhibited to advantage her charming little feet and slim ankles, and   she carried a handbag of Indian beadwork. Mlle. Dorian was a figure  calculated to fire the imagination of any man and to linger long and  sweetly in the memory.    Mrs. M'Gregor, palpably ill at ease, conducted her to an armchair.    \"You are very good,\" said the visitor, speaking with a certain  hesitancy and with a slight accent most musical and fascinating.  \"I wait a while if I may.\"    \"Dear, dear,\" muttered Mrs. M'Gregor, beginning to poke the fire, \"he  has let the fire down, of course! Is it out? No ... I see a wee  sparkie!\"    She set the poker upright before the nearly extinguished fire and  turned triumphantly to Mlle. Dorian, who was watching her with a  slight smile.    \"That will be a comforting blaze in a few minutes, Miss Dorian,\" she  said, and went towards the door.    \"If you please,\" called the girl, detaining her--\"do you permit me to  speak on the telephone a moment? As Dr. Stuart is not at home, I must  explain that I wait for him.\"    \"Certainly, Miss Dorian,\" replied Mrs. M'Gregor; \"use the telephone  by all means. But I think the doctor will be back any moment now.\"    \"Thank you so much.\"    Mrs. M'Gregor went out, not without a final backward glance at the  elegant figure in the armchair. Mlle. Dorian was seated, her chin  resting in her hand and her elbow upon the arm of the chair, gazing  into the smoke arising from the nearly extinguished ember of the fire.  The door closed, and Mrs. M'Gregor's footsteps could be heard receding  along the corridor.    Mlle. Dorian sprang from the chair and took out of her handbag a  number of small keys attached to a ring. Furtively she crossed the  room, all the time listening intently, and cast her cloak over the  back of the chair which was placed before the writing-table. Her robe  of white and gold clung to her shapely figure as she bent over the  table and tried three of the keys in the lock of the drawer which  contained Stuart's cheque-book and in which he had recently placed  the mysterious gold ornament. The third key fitted the lock, and Mlle.  Dorian pulled open the drawer. She discovered first the cheque-book  and next a private account-book; then from under the latter she drew  out a foolscap envelope sealed with red wax and bearing, in Stuart's  handwriting, the address:      Lost Property Office,    Metropolitan Police,    New Scotland Yard, S. W. I.    She uttered a subdued exclamation; then, as a spark of light gleamed  within the open drawer, she gazed as if stupefied at the little  ornament which she had suddenly perceived lying near the cheque-book.  She picked it up and stared at it aghast. A moment she hesitated;  then, laying down the fragment of gold and also the long envelope upon  the table, she took up the telephone. Keeping her eyes fixed upon the  closed door of the study, she asked for the number East 89512, and  whilst she waited for the connection continued that nervous watching  and listening. Suddenly she began to speak, in a low voice.    \"Yes! ... Miska speaks. Listen! One of the new keys--it fits. I have  the envelope. But, also in the same drawer, I find a part of a broken  gold _'agrab_ (scorpion). Yes, it is broken. It must be they find it,  on him.\" Her manner grew more and more agitated. \"Shall I bring it?  The envelope it is very large. I do not know if----\"    From somewhere outside the house came a low, wailing cry--a cry which  Stuart, if he had heard it, must have recognized to be identical with  that which he had heard in the night--but which he had forgotten to  record in his written account.    \"Ah!\" whispered the girl--\"there is the signal! It is the doctor who  returns.\" She listened eagerly, fearfully, to the voice which spoke  over the wires. \"Yes--yes!\"    Always glancing toward the door, she put down the instrument, took  up the long envelope and paused for a moment, thinking that she had  heard the sound of approaching footsteps. She exhibited signs of  nervous indecision, tried to thrust the envelope into her little bag  and realized that even folded it would not fit so as to escape  observation. She ran across to the grate and dropped the envelope  upon the smouldering fire. As she did so, the nicely balanced poker  fell with a clatter upon the tiled hearth.    She started wildly, ran back to the table, took up the broken ornament  and was about to thrust it into the open drawer, when the study door  was flung open and Stuart came in.          CHAPTER V    THE SEALED ENVELOPE      \"MADEMOISELLE DORIAN!\" cried Stuart joyously, advancing with  outstretched hand. She leaned back against the table watching him--and  suddenly he perceived the open drawer. He stopped. His expression  changed to one of surprise and anger, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#4)"],[1,"be, is secondary and indirect. An increase in       the greatness of the effect adds to its importance. It does       not alter its character.[14]    We all know how this issue was finally resolved. In the Fair Labor  Standards Act of 1938 Congress not only prohibits interstate commerce in  goods produced by substandard labor, but it directly forbids, with  penalties, the employment of labor in industrial production for  interstate commerce on other than certain prescribed terms. And in  United States _v._ Darby[15] this Act was sustained by the Court, in all  its sweeping provisions, on the basis of an opinion by Chief Justice  Stone which in turn is based on Chief Justice Marshall's famous opinions  in McCulloch _v._ Maryland and Gibbons _v._ Ogden rendered more than a  century and a quarter ago. In short, as a principle capable of  delimiting the national legislative power, the concept of Dual  Federalism as regards the present Court seems today to be at an end,  with consequent aggrandizement of national power.    There is, however, another side to the story. For in one respect even  the great Marshall has been in effect overruled in support of enlarged  views of national authority. Without essaying a vain task of \"tithing  mint, anise and cummin,\" it is fairly accurate to say that throughout  the 100 years which lie between Marshall's death and the cases of the  1930's, the conception of the federal relationship which on the whole  prevailed with the Court was a competitive conception, one which  envisaged the National Government and the States as jealous rivals. To  be sure, we occasionally get some striking statements of contrary  tendency, as in Justice Bradley's opinion in 1880 for a divided Court in  the Siebold Case,[16] where is reflected recognition of certain results  of the War between the States; or later in a frequently quoted dictum by  Justice McKenna, in Hoke _v._ United States, in which the Mann White  Slave Act was sustained in 1913:         Our dual form of government has its perplexities, State and       Nation having different spheres of jurisdiction ... but it       must be kept in mind that we are one people; and the powers       reserved to the states and those conferred on the nation are       adapted to be exercised, whether independently or       concurrently, to promote the general welfare, material and       moral.[17]    The competitive concept is, nevertheless, the one much more generally  evident in the outstanding results for American Constitutional Law  throughout three-quarters of its history. Of direct pertinence in this  connection is the doctrine of tax exemption which converted federalism  into a principle of private immunity from taxation, so that, for  example, neither government could tax as income the official salaries  paid by the other government.[18] This doctrine traces immediately to  Marshall's famous judgment in McCulloch _v._ Maryland,[19] and bespeaks  a conception of the federal relationship which regards the National  Government and the States as bent on mutual frustration. Today the  principle of tax exemption, except so far as Congress may choose to  apply it to federal instrumentalities by virtue of its protective powers  under the necessary and proper clause, is at an end.    By the cooperative conception of the federal relationship the States and  the National Government are regarded as mutually complementary parts of  a single governmental mechanism all of whose powers are intended to  realize the current purposes of government according to their  applicability to the problem in hand. This is the conception on which  the recent social and economic legislation professes to rest. It is the  conception which the Court invokes throughout its decisions in  sustaining the Social Security Act of 1935 and supplementary state  legislation. It is the conception which underlies congressional  legislation of recent years making certain crimes against the States,  like theft, racketeering, kidnapping, crimes also against the National  Government whenever the offender extends his activities beyond state  boundary lines. The usually cited constitutional justification for such  legislation is that which was advanced forty years ago in the above  quoted Hoke Case.[20]    It has been argued that the cooperative conception of the federal  relationship, especially as it is realized in the policy of federal  subventions to the States, tends to break down state initiative and to  devitalize state policies. Actually, its effect has often been just the  contrary, and for the reason pointed out by Justice Cardozo in Helvering  _v._ Davis,[21] decided in 1937, namely, that the States, competing as  they do with one another to attract investors, have not been able to  embark separately upon expensive programs of relief and social  insurance. Another great objection to Cooperative Federalism is more  difficult to meet. This is, that Cooperative Federalism invites further  aggrandizement of national power. Unquestionably it does, for when two  cooperate, it is the stronger member of the combination who usually  calls the tunes. Resting as it does primarily on the superior fiscal  resources of the National Government, Cooperative Federalism has been,  at least to date, a short expression for a constantly increasing  concentration of power at Washington in the stimulation and supervision  of local policies.[22]    The last element of the concept of Federalism to demand attention is the  doctrine that the National Government is a government of enumerated  powers only, and consequently under the necessity at all times of  justifying its measures juridically by pointing to some particular  clause or clauses of the Constitution which, when read separately or in  combination, may be thought to grant power adequate to such measures. In  spite of such recent decisions as that in United States _v._ Darby, this  time-honored doctrine still guides the authoritative interpreters of the  Constitution in determining the validity of acts which are passed by  Congress in presumed exercise of its powers of domestic legislation--the  course of reasoning pursued by the Chief Justice in the Darby Case  itself is proof that such is the fact. In the field of foreign  relations, on the contrary, the doctrine of enumerated powers has always  had a difficult row to hoe, and today may be unqualifiedly asserted to  be defunct.    As early as the old case of Penhallow _v._ Doane, which was decided by  the Supreme Court in 1795, certain counsel thought it pertinent to urge  the following conception of the War Power:         A formal compact is not essential to the institution of a       government. Every nation that governs itself, under what form       soever, without any dependence on a foreign power, is a       sovereign state. In every society there must be a sovereignty.       1 Dall. Rep. 46, 57. Vatt. B. 1. ch. 1. sec. 4. The powers of       war form an inherent characteristic of national sovereignty;       and, it is not denied, that Congress possessed those       powers....[23]    To be sure, only two of the Justices felt it necessary to comment on  this argument, which one of them endorsed, while the other rejected it.    Yet seventy-five years later Justice Bradley incorporated closely  kindred doctrine into his concurring opinion in the Legal Tender  Cases;[24] and in the years following the Court itself frequently  brought the same general outlook to questions affecting the National  Government's powers in the field of foreign relations. Thus in the  Chinese Exclusion Case, decided in 1889, Justice Field, in asserting the  unlimited power of the National Government, and hence of Congress, to  exclude aliens from American shores, remarked:         While under our Constitution and form of government the great       mass of local matters is controlled by local authorities, the       United States, in their relation to foreign countries and       their subjects or citizens, are one nation, invested with the       powers which belong to independent nations, the exercise of       which can be invoked for the maintenance of its absolute       independence and security throughout its entire territory.[25]    And four years later the power of the National Government to deport  alien residents at the option of Congress was based by Justice Gray on  the same general reasoning.[26]    Finally, in 1936, Justice Sutherland, speaking for the Court in United  States _v._ Curtiss-Wright Corporation, with World War I a still recent  memory, took over bodily counsel's argument of 140 years earlier, and  elevated it to the head of the column of authoritative constitutional  doctrine. He said:         A political society cannot endure without a supreme will       somewhere. Sovereignty is never held in suspense. When,       therefore, the external sovereignty of Great Britain in       respect of the colonies ceased, it immediately passed to the       Union.... It results that the investment of the Federal       government with the powers of external sovereignty did not       depend upon the affirmative grants of the Constitution. The       powers to declare and wage war, to conclude peace, to make       treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations with other       sovereignties, if they had never been mentioned in the       Constitution, would have vested in the Federal government as a       necessary concomitant of nationality.[27]    In short, the power of the National Government in the field of  international relationship is not simply a complexus of particular  enumerated powers; it is an inherent power, one which is attributable to  the National Government on the ground solely of its belonging to the  American People as a sovereign political entity at International Law. In  that field the principle of Federalism no longer holds, if it ever  did.[28]      II    The Separation of Powers    The second great "]]]
