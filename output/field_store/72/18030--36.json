They are situated in the gap between the terrestrial and the jovian  planets, and about 500 of them have been discovered, while there is  reason to think that their real number may be many thousands. The  largest of them is less than 500 miles in diameter, and many of those  recently discovered may be not more than ten or twenty miles in  diameter. What marvelous places of abode such little planets would be if  it were possible to believe them inhabited, we shall see more clearly  when we come to consider them in their turn. But without regard to the  question of habitability, the asteroids will be found extremely  interesting.    In the next chapter we proceed to take up the planets for study as  individuals, beginning with Mercury, the one nearest the sun.          CHAPTER II    MERCURY, A WORLD OF TWO FACES AND MANY CONTRASTS      Mercury, the first of the other worlds that we are going to consider,  fascinates by its grotesqueness, like a piece of Chinese ivory carving,  so small is it for its kind and so finished in its eccentric details. In  a little while we shall see how singular Mercury is in many of the  particulars of planetary existence, but first of all let us endeavor to  obtain a clear idea of the actual size and mass of this strange little  planet. Compared with the earth it is so diminutive that it looks as if  it had been cut out on the pattern of a satellite rather than that of an  independent planet. Its diameter, 3,000 miles, only exceeds the moon's  by less than one half, while both Jupiter and Saturn, among their  remarkable collections of moons, have each at least one that is  considerably larger than the planet Mercury. But, insignificant though  it be in size, it holds the place of honor, nearest to the sun.    It was formerly thought that Mercury possessed a mass greatly in excess  of that which its size would seem to imply, and some estimates, based  upon the apparent effect of its attraction on comets, made it equal in  mean density to lead, or even to the metal mercury. This led to curious  speculations concerning its probable metallic composition, and the  possible existence of vast quantities of such heavy elements as gold in  the frame of the planet. But more recent, and probably more correct,  computations place Mercury third in the order of density among the  members of the solar system, the earth ranking as first and Venus as  second. Mercury's density is now believed to be less than the earth's in  the ratio of 85 to 100. Accepting this estimate, we find that the force  of gravity upon the surface of Mercury is only one third as great as  upon the surface of the earth--i.e., a body weighing 300 pounds on the  earth would weigh only 100 pounds on Mercury.    This is an important matter, because not only the weight of bodies, but  the density of the atmosphere and even the nature of its gaseous  constituents, are affected by the force of gravity, and if we could  journey from world to world, in our bodily form, it would make a great  difference to us to find gravity considerably greater or less upon other  planets than it is upon our own. This alone might suffice to render some  of the planets impossible places of abode for us, unless a decided  change were effected in our present physical organization.    One of the first questions that we should ask about a foreign world to  which we proposed to pay a visit, would relate to its atmosphere. We  should wish to know in advance if it had air and water, and in what  proportions and quantities. However its own peculiar inhabitants might  be supposed able to dispense with these things, to _us_ their presence  would be essential, and if we did not find them, even a planet that  blazed with gold and diamonds only waiting to be seized would remain  perfectly safe from our invasion. Now, in the case of Mercury, some  doubt on this point exists.    Messrs. Huggins, Vogel, and others have believed that they found  spectroscopic proof of the existence of both air and the vapor of water  on Mercury. But the necessary observations are of a very delicate  nature, and difficult to make, and some astronomers doubt whether we  possess sufficient proof that Mercury has an atmosphere. At any rate,  its atmosphere is very rare as compared with the earth's, but we need  not, on that account, conclude that Mercury is lifeless. Possibly, in  view of certain other peculiarities soon to be explained, a rare  atmosphere would be decidedly advantageous.    Being much nearer the sun than the earth is, Mercury can be seen by us  only in the same quarter of the sky where the sun itself appears. As it  revolves in its orbit about the sun it is visible, alternately, in the  evening for a short time after sunset and in the morning for a short  time before sunrise, but it can never be seen, as the outer planets are  seen, in the mid-heaven or late at night. When seen low in the twilight,  at evening or morning, it glows with the brilliance of a bright  first-magnitude star, and is a beautiful object, though few casual  watchers of the stars ever catch sight of it. When it is nearest the  earth and is about to pass between the earth and the sun, it temporarily  disappears in the glare of the sunlight; and likewise, when it it is  farthest from the earth and passing around in its orbit on the opposite  side of the sun, it is concealed by the blinding solar rays.  Consequently, except with the instruments of an observatory, which are  able to show it in broad day, Mercury is never visible save during the  comparatively brief periods of time when it is near its greatest  apparent distance east or west from the sun.    The nearer a planet is to the sun the more rapidly it is compelled to  move in its orbit, and Mercury, being the nearest to the sun of all the  planets, is by far the swiftest footed among them. But its velocity is  subject to remarkable variation, owing to the peculiar form of the orbit  in which the planet travels. This is more eccentric than the orbit of  any other planet, except some of the asteroids. The sun being situated  in one focus of the elliptical orbit, when Mercury is at perihelion, or  nearest to the sun, its distance from that body is 28,500,000 miles, but  when it is at aphelion, or farthest from the sun, its distance is  43,500,000 miles. The difference is no less than 14,000,000 miles! When  nearest the sun Mercury darts forward in its orbit at the rate of  twenty-nine miles in a second, while when farthest from the sun the  speed is reduced to twenty-three miles.    Now, let us return for a moment to the consideration of the wonderful  variations in Mercury's distance from the sun, for we shall find that  their effects are absolutely startling, and that they alone suffice to  mark a wide difference between Mercury and the earth, considered as the  abodes of sentient creatures. The total change of distance amounts, as  already remarked, to 14,000,000 miles, which is almost half the entire  distance separating the planet from the sun at perihelion. This immense  variation of distance is emphasized by the rapidity with which it takes  place. Mercury's periodic time, i.e., the period required for it to make  a single revolution about the sun--or, in other words, the length of its  year--is eighty-eight of our days. In just one half of that time, or in  about six weeks, it passes from aphelion to perihelion; that is to say,  in six weeks the whole change in its distance from the sun takes place.  In six weeks Mercury falls 14,000,000 miles--for it _is_ a fall, though  in a curve instead of a straight line--falls 14,000,000 miles toward the  sun! And, as it falls, like any other falling body it gains in speed,  until, having reached the perihelion point, its terrific velocity  counteracts its approach and it begins to recede. At the end of the next  six weeks it once more attains its greatest distance, and turns again to  plunge sunward.    Of course it may be said of every planet having an elliptical orbit  that between aphelion and perihelion it is falling toward the sun, but  no other planet than Mercury travels in an orbit sufficiently eccentric,  and approaches sufficiently near to the sun, to give to the mind so  vivid an impression of an actual, stupendous fall!    Next let us consider the effects of this rapid fall, or approach, toward  the sun, which is so foreign to our terrestrial experience, and so  appalling to the imagination.    First, we must remember that the nearer a planet is to the sun the  greater is the amount of heat and light that it receives, the variation  being proportional to the inverse square of the distance. The earth's  distance from the sun being 93,000,000 miles, while Mercury's is only  36,000,000, it follows, to begin with, that Mercury gets, on the  average, more than six and a half times as much heat from the sun as the  earth does. That alone is enough to make it seem impossible that Mercury  can be the home of living forms resembling those of the earth, for  imagine the heat of the sun in the middle of a summer's day increased  six or seven fold! If there were no mitigating influences, the face of  the earth would shrivel as in the blast of a furnace, the very stones  would become incandescent, and the oceans would turn into steam.    Still, notwithstanding the tremendous heat poured upon Mercury as  compared with that which our planet receives, we can possibly, and for  the sake of a clearer understanding of the effects of the varying  distance, which is the object of our present inquiry, find a loophole to  admit the chance that yet there may be living beings there. We might,  for instance, suppose that, owing to the rarity of its atmosphere, the  excessive heat was quickly radiated away, or that there was something in  the constitution of the atmosphere"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18435"],[0,"Good Things to Eat, as Suggested (#4)"],[1,"cover, steam for two hours, and cool. After it gets quite cold set  on the ice until ready to carve.      ~OYSTERS A LA POULETTE~--One quart oysters, four level tablespoons  butter, four level tablespoons flour, one-half level teaspoon salt,  one-fourth level teaspoon celery salt, one-half cup oysters liquor, one  cup each of chicken stock and milk, juice one-half lemon. Look over the  oysters, heat quickly to the boiling point, then drain and strain the  liquor through cheesecloth. Melt the butter, add the flour, salt and  celery salt, and when blended add the oyster liquor, chicken stock and  milk, stirring until thick and smooth. Cook for five minutes, then add  the oysters and lemon juice, and serve at once.      ~OYSTER FRICASSE~--Put one pint of oysters into a double boiler or into  the top of the chafing dish. As soon as the edges curl add the slightly  beaten yolks of three eggs, a few grains of pepper and half a teaspoon  of salt. Set over hot water and as soon as the egg thickens add a  teaspoon of lemon juice. Spread on slices of toasted brown bread and  garnish with celery tips. Celery salt is a good addition to the  seasoning.      ~RECHAUFFE OF FINNAN HADDIE~--Cover a finnan haddie with boiling water  and let it simmer for twenty minutes, then remove the kettle and flake,  discarding the skin and bones. For three cups of fish scald two cups of  thin cream and add to the fish. Season with paprika or a dash of  cayenne, and when thoroughly heated stir in the yolks of two eggs,  diluted with a little hot cream.      ~SCALLOPED CLAMS IN SHELL~--Chop the clams very fine and season with  salt and cayenne pepper. In another dish mix some powdered crackers,  moistened first with warm milk, then with clam liquor, a beaten egg and  some melted butter, the quantity varying with the amount of clams used;  stir in the chopped clams. Wash clean as many shells as the mixture will  fill, wipe and butter them, fill heaping full with the mixture,  smoothing with a spoon. Place in rows in a baking pan and bake until  well browned. Send to the table hot.      ~SCALLOPED SHRIMPS~--Make a sauce with a level tablespoon of cornstarch,  a rounding tablespoon of butter and one cup of milk cooked together five  minutes. Season with one-quarter level teaspoon of salt and a few grains  of cayenne. Add one can of shrimps after removing all bits of shell and  mincing them fine. Use, if preferred, the same amount of fresh shrimps.  Put into buttered scallop shells, scatter fine bread crumbs over the  top of each, and dot with bits of butter. Set in a quick oven to brown  the crumbs, and serve hot in the shells.      ~STEWED CODFISH~--Take a piece of boiled cod, remove the skin and bones  and pick into flakes. Put these in a stewpan, with a little butter,  salt, pepper, minced parsley and juice of a lemon. Put on the fire and  when the contents of the pan are quite hot the fish is ready to serve.      ~CODFISH CONES~--When it is not convenient to make and preparation into  shapes, dip them into egg beaten with cream, then in sifted breadcrumbs  and let them stand for half an hour or so to dry; then fry them a  delicate color after plunging into boiling lard. Take them out, drain,  place on a napkin on a dish and serve. The remainder of the chicken  stock may be used for making consomme or soup.          BEEF, VEAL AND PORK      ~BEEF EN CASSEROLE~--Have a steak cut two inches thick and broil two  minutes on each side. Lay in a casserole and pour round two cups of rich  brown sauce; add three onions cut in halves.      ~BEEF HASH CAKES~--Chop cold corned beef fine and add a little more than  the same measure of cold boiled potatoes, chopped less fine than the  beef. Season with onion juice, make into small cakes, and brown in  butter or beef drippings; serve each cake on a slice of buttered toast  moistened slightly.      ~BEEF RAGOUT~--Another way to serve the remnants of cold meat is to melt  one rounding tablespoon of butter in a pan and let it brown lightly. Add  two rounding tablespoons of flour and stir until smooth and browned; add  one cup of strained tomato and one cup of stock or strained gravy, or  part gravy and part water. When this sauce is thickened add two cups of  meat cut in small, thin slices or shavings. Stir until heated through  and no longer, as that will harden the meat. Season with salt and  pepper, and serve at once.      ~BOILED BONED HAM~--Wash a ham, place it in a saucepan, cover with cold  water and boil for four or five hours, according to its size. Take out  the bone, roll the ham and place it in a basin with a large weight on  top. When cold put it on a dish, garnish with parsley, and serve.      ~BONED HAM~--Have the bone taken from a small ham and put into a kettle  of cold water with one onion cut in quarters, a dozen cloves, and a bay  leaf. Cook slowly until tender and do not test it until you have allowed  fifteen minutes to the pound. Take from the kettle, remove the skin,  brush with beaten egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and set in the oven to  brown.      ~BREADED CUTLETS~--Have the cutlets cut into portions of the right size  for serving. Dust each side with salt and pepper. Beat one egg with a  tablespoon of cold water, dip the cutlets in this and roll in fine bread  crumbs. Fry three slices of salt pork in the frying-pan and cook the  cutlets in this fat. As veal must be well done to be wholesome, cook it  slowly about fifteen minutes. Serve with a gravy made from the contents  of the pan or with a tomato sauce.      ~BROILED LIVER AND BACON~--As broiling in most cases is wasteful, the  liver and bacon are generally fried together, but the dish is somewhat  spoiled by this method. The best way is to fry the well-trimmed slices  of bacon, and after having washed and sliced the liver, say a third of  an inch thick, dry it on a cloth and dip in flour. Place in the bacon  fat and broil over a clear fire, adding pepper and salt while cooking.  When done lay on a dish, placing a piece of bacon on each piece of  liver.      ~BROILED PIG'S FEET~--Thoroughly clean as many pig's feet as are  required, and split lengthwise in halves, tying them with a broad tape  so they will not open in cooking. Put in a saucepan with a seasoning of  parsley, thyme, bay leaf, allspice, carrots and onions, with sufficient  water to cover. Boil slowly until tender, and let them cool in the  liquor. Dip in the beaten yolks of eggs and warmed butter. Sprinkle with  salt and pepper and cover with bread crumbs seasoned with very finely  chopped shallot and parsley. Put on a gridiron over a clear fire and  broil until well and evenly browned. Unbind and arrange on a dish,  garnish with fried parsley and serve.      ~BROILED SHEEP'S KIDNEYS~--To broil sheep's kidneys cut them open, put  them on small skewers. Season with salt and pepper and broil. When done  serve with shallot or maitre d'hotel sauce.      ~BRUNSWICK STEW~--Cut up one chicken, preferably a good fat hen, cover  with cold water, season with salt and pepper, and cook slowly until  about half done. Add six ears of green corn, splitting through the  kernels, one pint butter beans and six large tomatoes chopped fine. A  little onion may be added if desired. Cook until the vegetables are  thoroughly done, but very slowly, so as to avoid burning. Add strips of  pastry for dumplings and cook five minutes. Fresh pork can be used in  place of the chicken and canned vegetables instead of the fresh.      ~CALVES' TONGUES~--Wash and put into a saucepan with half a dozen slices  of carrot, an onion sliced, five cloves, a teaspoon of whole  peppercorns, and half a level tablespoon of salt. Cover with boiling  water and simmer until tender. Drain and cool a little, then take off  the skin. Drop back into the hot liquid to reheat. Serve with a sauce.  Melt one-quarter cup of butter, add three slightly rounding tablespoons  of flour, stir and cook until browned, add two cups of broth, brown  stock of rich gravy melted in hot water, one-half level teaspoon of  salt, the same of paprika, a saltspoon of allspice, one tablespoon of  vinegar, a few grains of cayenne, and half a tablespoon of capers. Pour  over the tongues and serve.      ~CORNED BEEF HASH~--To two cups of chopped cold corned beef, add two  cups of chopped cold boiled potatoes. Heat three tablespoons of bacon  fat in a frying pan and add the meat and potato, add pepper and salt, if  necessary, and moisten with water. Cook slowly until a nice brown  underneath. Roll from the pan on to a hot platter. Garnish with parsley  and serve with pickled beets.      ~ENGLISH POT ROAST~--Cut one pound of cold roast into two-inch pieces,  slice four good sized potatoes thin, also one onion, into a deep dish,  put a layer of the beef, one of potatoes, one of onions, salt and  pepper, another layer of meat, potatoes and onions, season again, add  one cup gravy, and over all put a thick layer of potatoes. Bake three  hours--the longer and slower the better.      ~FRANKFORT SAUSAGE~--For this use any part of the pig, but equal  quantities of lean and fat. Mince fine, season with ground coriander  seed, salt, pepper, and a small quantity of nutmeg. Have ready skins,  well cleaned and soaked in cold water for several hours, fill with the  seasoned meat, secure the ends and hang in a cool, dry place until  needed.      ~FRIED HAM~--Cut off a thick slice of ham. Place in a saucepan over the  fire, with sufficient water to cover and let come to a boil. Pour off  the water, and fry the ham slowly until it is brown on both sides.  Season with pepper and serve. Eggs are usually served with fried ham.  They may be fried in the same pan or separately, in sufficient grease to  prevent burning. Season with salt and pepper, place around the ham.      ~HAM AND CHICKEN PIE~--Trim off the skin of some cold chicken and cut  the meat into small pieces. Mix with an equal quantity of finely chopped  lean ham and a small lot of chopped"]]]
