Minerva visited shameless Venus. But wisdom took not root at Lucienne.    For the Revolution, alas! had to cut off this charming head, which was  at one time the ideal of beauty--of court beauty. Madame du Barry gave  hospitality to the wounded at the arrest of the queen. \"These wounded  youths have no other regret than that they have not died for a princess  so worthy as your Majesty,\" she said. \"What I have done for these brave  men is only what they have merited. I consoled them, and I respect their  wounds when I think, Madame, that without their devotion, your Majesty  would no longer be alive. Lucienne is yours, Madame, for was it not your  beneficence which gave it to me? All I possess has come to me through  the royal family. I have too much loyalty to forget it.\"    But negro Zamor became a citizen like Mirabeau. It was Zamor who took to  Du Barry her lover's head. It was Zamor who denounced her at the club of  the Jacobins. \"The fealty (faith) of the black man is white,\" said the  negro. But he learned how to make it red. Jeanne was imprisoned and  tried before Dumas.    \"Your age?\"    \"Forty-two years.\" She was really forty-seven. Coquetry even at the  guillotine.    The public accuser, Fouquier Tinville, was not disarmed by the sweet  voluptuousness still possessed by this pale and already fading beauty.  He accused her of treason against the nation. Could the defender of Du  Barry, who had also defended Marie Antoinette, find an eloquent word?  No; Fouquier Tinville was more eloquent than Chauveau-Lagarde. So  the mistress of Louis was condemned. It was eleven o'clock in the  evening--the hour for supper at Versailles when she was queen!    She passed the night in prayer and weeping, or rather in a frenzy of  fright. In the morning she said it was \"too early to die\"; she wished  to have a little time in order to make some disclosures. The Comite sent  someone to listen to her. What did she say? She revealed all that was  hidden away at Lucienne; she gave word by word an inventory of the  treasures she had concealed, forgetting nothing, for did not each word  give her a second of time?    \"Have you finished?\" said the inquisitor. \"No,\" said Jeanne. \"I have not  mentioned a silver syringe concealed under the staircase!\"    Meanwhile the horses of destiny stamped with impatience, and spectators  were knocking at the prison gate. When they put her, already half  dead, on the little cart, she bent her head and grew pale. The Du Barry  alone--a sinner without redemption.    She saw the people in the square of Louis XV; she struck her breast  three times and murmured: \"It is my fault!\" But this Christian  resignation abandoned her when she mounted the scaffold--there where the  statue of Louis XV had been--and she implored of the executioner:    \"One moment, Mr. Executioner! One moment more!\"    But the executioner was pitiless Sanson. It was block and the  knife--without the \"one moment!\"    Such was the last bed of the Du Barry. Had the almanac of Liege only  predicted to her that the one who would lead her to her bed for the  last time would not be a King but a citizen executioner, it might have  been--but why moralize?    Robert Arnot _To the Reader_    _As the early part of Madame du Barry's career had little to  differentiate it from the life of an ordinary courtezan, the editor has  deemed it best to confine the memoirs to the years in her life which  helped to make history._    _--Editor*_         *\"Editor\" here means the author, who is assuming       the persona of the editor of the Comtesse's memoirs.        CHAPTER I      Letter from Lebel--Visit from Lebel--Nothing conclusive--Another visit  from Lebel--Invitation to sup with the king--Instructions of the comte  Jean to the comtesse    One morning comte Jean entered my apartment, his face beaming with  delight.    \"Read,\" said he, giving me a letter, \"read, Jeannette: victory is ours.  News from Morand. Lebel is coming to Paris, and will dine with us. Are  we alone?\"    \"No, there are two of your countrymen whom you invited yesterday.\"    \"I will write and put them off. Morand alone must dine with Lebel; he  ought to have a place at the feast which he furnishes with such good  music. Come, my dear girl, we touch the moment of importance, it is in  your beauty and power of pleasing that I place all my hopes. I think  I may rely on you; but, above all, do not forget that you are my  sister-in-law.\"    \"Brother-in-law,\" said I, laughing, \"it is not unnecessary that I should  know decidedly to which of family I am married? The custom in France is  not that a woman be the undivided property of three brothers.\"    \"That only happens in Venice,\" replied the comte; \"my brother Elie is  too young, you must be the wife of Guillaume, my second brother.\"    \"Very well; I am the comtesse Guillaume du Barry; that does famously  well; we like to know whom we are married to.\"    After this conversation, comte Jean insisted on presiding at my  toilette. He acquitted himself of the task, with a most laughable  attention. During two good hours, at least, he tormented first  Henriette, and then the female hairdresser, for I had not yet followed  the mode, which began to be very general, of having my hair dressed by a  man. Comte Jean passed alternately from my dressing-room to the kitchen.  He knew Lebel was a gallant and a gourmand*, and he was anxious to  please him in all senses at once.          *He seems to mean \"gourmet\" rather than \"gourmand.\"        --Transcriber    At one o'clock I was under arms, and prepared to receive him on whom  my destiny depended. As soon as I reached the drawing-room, comte Jean  compelled me to submit to the test of a rigid examination.    His serious air amused me much as he gazed at me some time in solemn  silence. At length his forehead relaxed, a smile of satisfaction played  on his lips, and extending his arms to me, without venturing to touch  me, \"You are charming, divine,\" he said; \"Lebel ought to go and hang  himself if he does not fall down at your knees.\"    Soon afterwards the folding-doors were hastily opened, and a servant  announced M. Lebel, _premier de sa Majeste_, with M. Morand. The comte  went to meet the arrivals, and as I now saw Lebel for the first time, he  presented him to me formally.    \"Sister, this is M. Lebel, _premier de sa Majeste _, who has done us the  honor to come and dine with us.\"    \"And he confers a real pleasure on us,\" said I, looking smilingly on M.  Lebel. My look had its effect, for Lebel remained mute and motionless  from admiration at my person. At length he stammered out a few  incoherent words, which I imagined to be compliments. The comte watched  Lebel anxiously, and Morand began to rub his hands, saying:    \"Well, sir, what think you of our celestial beauty?\"    \"She is worthy of a throne,\" replied Lebel, bending his head before  me, and taking my hand, which he pressed respectfully to his lips. This  reply was, perhaps, inadvertently made, but I took it as a good augury.  \"Yes,\" added Lebel, \"you are the most lovely creature I ever met, though  no one is more in the habit of seeing handsome females than myself.\"    \"And of causing them to be seen by others,\" replied comte Jean.    This was an opening which was not followed up by Lebel. His first  enthusiasm having passed, he measured me from head to foot, as if he  would take an accurate description of my person.    For my part I began to support the looks of Lebel with more assurance.  He was a man of no particular \"mark or likelihood,\" but had made  his way. Living at Versailles had given him a certain air of easy  impertinence, but you could not discover anything distinguished in his  manners, nothing which concealed his humble extraction. The direction  of the _Parc aux Cerfs_ gave him much influence with the king, who found  the convenience of such a man, who was willing to take upon himself all  the disagreeable part of his clandestine amours. His duties placed  him in contact with the ministers, the lieutenant of police, and the  comptroller-general. The highest nobility sought his friendship with  avidity. They all had a wife, a sister, a daughter, whom they wished to  make the favorite sultana; and for this it was necessary to get the ear  of Lebel. Thus, under a libertine prince, the destinies of France were  at the mercy of a _valet de chambre_.    I should tell you, however, that I never had occasion but to speak well  of him, and that I have the utmost gratitude for all he did for me. The  attachment he testified on our first meeting has never been altered. He  gave me his protection as far as it was necessary for me, and when the  favor of the king had accorded to me a station, whence all the court  sought to hurl me, Lebel seconded me with all his power in my efforts  to preserve it. I will say, that it is to his vigilance that I owe the  overthrow of more than one conspiracy against me. He was a warm and  sincere friend, and not at all interested in the services he rendered.  He did a great deal of good, as well as harm, in private. I know poor  families whom he has assisted with his own purse, when he could obtain  nothing for them from the king, for Louis was only prodigal in his  pleasures.    However, we dined, and Lebel praised me incessantly to the very skies,  and that with so much warmth, that I was fearful at one time he would  fall in love with me himself, and would not resign me to another. Thank  heaven, Lebel was a faithful servant.    After dinner, when we left the table, Lebel paid me some compliments;  then pulling out his watch, he spoke of an appointment at the Marais,  and left without saying a word of seeing us again.    At this abrupt departure, comte Jean and I looked at each other with  astonishment. As for Morand, he was overjoyed.    \"Well, comtesse,\" said he, \"behold the number of your slaves "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20839"],[0,"The Mountain Chant, A Navajo Ceremony (#4)"],[1," brother what he thought of the mimicry. When  the latter gave his approval, the elder brother said, \"Steal round to  the other side of the herd and when they see you they will come in my  direction.\" He waited, and when he saw that his brother had got to the  other side of the herd, he selected a big fat buck as his special  object, and began to move towards him, walking and pawing the ground  like a deer, and rubbing his antlers against the trees. Soon the buck  began to approach the hunter, but the latter kept his head constantly  turned toward the deer the better to maintain his disguise. Presently  the buck came quite close to the Indian, when the latter sped his arrow  and brought the quarry down. They carried the meat home and the old man  demanded that the meat and skin should all be his in payment for his  advice. This was the third time he had advised them and the third time  he had received a gift for his service. He directed that the meat should  be cut into pieces and hung in the trees to dry, and that the skin  should be stretched and dried for his bed.    21. Next day the elder brother desired the younger to stay at home,  saying that he would like to hunt alone. As usual, the old man warned  him against the south, and directed him to hunt in the country north of  the hogÃ¡n. He set out, accordingly, to the north; but he returned at  night without any game. Again on the following morning he set out alone,  and this time went to the west, as his father had directed. He hunted  all day without success, until near sunset, when it was time for him to  return. Then he remembered what his father had told him of the shrubs  that would always have deer for his arrow. Looking around he saw a cliff  rose, into which he shot his dart, and at the same instant he observed a  deer falling in the shrub. He ran to the spot and found a dead doe. When  he had skinned and dressed it, he could discover no high tree at hand  that he might hang it on to keep it safe from the wolves, so he laid the  meat on the top of the cliff rose, spread the skin over it, stuck an  arrow upright on the top of it, and went home. On his way he often said  to himself, \"Why does my father bid me never to go to the south?\" He  pondered much on the subject, and before he reached the hut he had  determined to satisfy his curiosity and to go to the south on the first  good opportunity. When he got home he told where he had laid the meat,  and, fearing that the crows or coyotes might get at it, he begged his  brother to hasten and bring it in. When the meat came he asked that a  piece might be broiled for his lunch on the hunt next day. All that  night the thought of his father's prohibition continued to haunt his  mind and would not be dismissed.    22. On the morrow, when he went forth on his hunt, his father gave him  the usual injunctions, saying: \"Hunt in any direction from the lodge  that you will; but go not to the south.\" He departed as if he were going  to the east; but when he got out of sight from the hogÃ¡n he turned round  to the south and pursued his way in that direction. He went on until he  came to the San Juan River, and he forded it at a place a little above  Beautiful Under the Cottonwoods, where they had crossed it before. He  went on to a place called TyÃ¨l-sakaÂ¢ (Erect Cat-Tail Rushes) and thence  to a place called DsiskÃ­Â¢ (Clay Hill). Here he laid his deer skin mask  and his weapons on the ground and climbed the hill to observe the  surrounding country for game. But instead of looking south in the  direction in which he was going he looked to the north, the country in  which dwelt his people. Before him were the beautiful peaks of  [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa, with their forested slopes. The clouds hung over the  mountain, the showers of rain fell down its sides, and all the country  looked beautiful. And he said to the land, \"AqalÃ ni!\" (greeting), and a  feeling of loneliness and homesickness came over him, and he wept and  sang this song:      That flowing water! That flowing water!    My mind wanders across it.    That broad water! That flowing water!    My mind wanders across it.    That old age water! That flowing water!    My mind wanders across it.    23. The gods heard his song and they were about to gratify his wishes.  He was destined to return to [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa, but not in the manner he most  desired. Had he gazed to the south when he ascended the hill, instead of  to the north, it might have been otherwise.    24. He wiped away his tears and went down to the place where he had laid  his mask and arms at the foot of the hill. He put on his buckskin coat  and was just putting on his mask, but had not quite drawn it down over  his head, when he heard a noise to the south and, looking around, he saw  a great crowd on horseback riding towards him. To see better he drew off  his mask, and then observed that they were dividing into two lines as  they advanced; a moment later he was surrounded. The horsemen were of  the tribe of Ute, a people whose language he did not understand. One  young man rode up close to the Navajo, aimed an arrow at the breast of  the latter and drew it to the head; but just as he was about to release  it an old man began to address the party in a loud voice and the young  warrior lowered his arrow and relaxed his bow. Then the speaker  dismounted, approached the captive, and seized him by the arm. For a  long time there was much loud talking and discussion among the Ute. Now  one would harangue the party and then another would make a speech, but  after a while the dispute ceased and the old man motioned to the Navajo  to move on. They made him trot while they followed him on horseback in a  semicircle, so that they could guard him and watch his movements. Soon  they came to TyÃ¨l-sakaÂ¢; shortly afterward they crossed the San Juan.  That night they camped near [Â¢]epÃ©ntsa, where they watched him closely  all night and gave him nothing to eat. They bound his feet firmly  together, tied his hands behind his back, and threw an untanned buckskin  over him before they lay down to sleep.    25. They set out on their journey again early in the morning. At  ÃÃ²inÃ§eski` (Scattered Springs) they stopped for a little while to eat,  but the only food they gave the Navajo was the full of his palm of  service berries. When they arrived on the south side of ÃÃ²tsosi (Narrow  Water) they halted for the night and a number went out to hunt. Among  them they secured two deer, one large and one small; the feet of these  they gave to their captive for his supper. Next morning they gave him a  piece of liver, half of which he ate and the rest he kept. They moved on  rapidly and rested for the night at Dsil nahoyÃ l, where there was a  spring. They had given him nothing to eat all that day, and at night  they gave him nothing; so it was well for him that he had secreted part  of the liver. This he ate after dark. On the third morning he had to set  out fasting and had to go on foot as usual. About noon, however, one of  the Ute took pity on him and lent him a horse to ride, while the owner  of the horse walked all the afternoon. That night they arrived at the  bank of a large river, and here they gave him to understand, by signs,  that this was the last river they would cross until they got home.  Beyond the river there was nothing in sight but a great plain.    26. By the light of the morning, however, on the next day, he discerned  some mountains showing their points faintly above the northern horizon.  To these the Ute pointed and motioned to him to go ahead. They did not  follow him immediately; but saddled up at their leisure while the Navajo  went on. Though he was now for some time alone on the trail and out of  sight of his captors, he knew that he could not escape; all around and  before him was a desert plain where he could not discover a single  hiding place; so he trudged on, tired and hungry and sorrowing, and he  wept all along the way. At noon they gave him another handful of  berries.    27. At night they came to a plain situated between four mountains, one  on the east, one on the south, one on the west, and one on the north,  and here there was a great encampment of Ute, whose tents were scattered  around in different places on the plain. There was one tent whose top  was painted black and whose base was painted white and which had a  forked pole set in the ground in front of it. To this his master, the  old man who had saved his life and taken him by the arm on the occasion  of his capture, led him, while the rest of the war party departed to  their respective tents. The old man hung his own arms and accouterments  on the pole, and the slave, following his example, hung his deer skin  mask and robe on the forks and laid his crutches against the pole, and  he prayed to the head of the deer, saying:      Whenever I have appealed to you, you have helped me, my pet.    Once you were alive, my pet.    Take care that I do not die, my pet.    Watch over me.    When he had finished his prayer an old man came and danced around him,  and when the latter had done an old woman approached with a whistle in  her hand and she whistled all around him. This was for joy because they  had captured one of an alien tribe. Then his master motioned to him to  go into the tent. Here he was given a large bowl of berries of which he  ate his fill, and he was allowed to lie down and sleep undisturbed until  morning.    28. Next morning the Ute began to enter the tent. They came one by one  and in small groups until after a while there was a considerable crowd  present. Then they gave the Navajo to understand by signs that they  wished to know for what purpose he wore the mask and the buckskin. He  answered that he used them for no particular purpose, but only for a  whim. They repeated the question three times very pointedly and  searchingly, but he continued to make evasive replies. The fourth time  they addressed him they"]]]
