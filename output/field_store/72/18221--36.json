Don't hope it -- the slinking hound,      He sloped across to the Queensland side,     And sold the Swagman for fifty pound,      And stole the money, and more beside.     And took to drink, and by some good chance      Was killed -- thrown out of a stolen trap.     And that was the end of this small romance,      The end of the story of Conroy's Gap.          Our New Horse           The boys had come back from the races      All silent and down on their luck;     They'd backed 'em, straight out and for places,      But never a winner they struck.     They lost their good money on Slogan,      And fell, most uncommonly flat,     When Partner, the pride of the Bogan,      Was beaten by Aristocrat.       And one said, 'I move that instanter      We sell out our horses and quit,     The brutes ought to win in a canter,      Such trials they do when they're fit.     The last one they ran was a snorter --      A gallop to gladden one's heart --     Two-twelve for a mile and a quarter,      And finished as straight as a dart.       'And then when I think that they're ready      To win me a nice little swag,     They are licked like the veriest neddy --      They're licked from the fall of the flag.     The mare held her own to the stable,      She died out to nothing at that,     And Partner he never seemed able      To pace it with Aristocrat.       'And times have been bad, and the seasons      Don't promise to be of the best;     In short, boys, there's plenty of reasons      For giving the racing a rest.     The mare can be kept on the station --      Her breeding is good as can be --     But Partner, his next destination      Is rather a trouble to me.       'We can't sell him here, for they know him      As well as the clerk of the course;     He's raced and won races till, blow him,      He's done as a handicap horse.     A jady, uncertain performer,      They weight him right out of the hunt,     And clap it on warmer and warmer      Whenever he gets near the front.       'It's no use to paint him or dot him      Or put any 'fake' on his brand,     For bushmen are smart, and they'd spot him      In any sale-yard in the land.     The folk about here could all tell him,      Could swear to each separate hair;     Let us send him to Sydney and sell him,      There's plenty of Jugginses there.       'We'll call him a maiden, and treat 'em      To trials will open their eyes,     We'll run their best horses and beat 'em,      And then won't they think him a prize.     I pity the fellow that buys him,      He'll find in a very short space,     No matter how highly he tries him,      The beggar won't _RACE_ in a race.'           .   .   .   .   .       Next week, under 'Seller and Buyer',      Appeared in the _DAILY GAZETTE_:     'A racehorse for sale, and a flyer;      Has never been started as yet;     A trial will show what his pace is;      The buyer can get him in light,     And win all the handicap races.      Apply here before Wednesday night.'       He sold for a hundred and thirty,      Because of a gallop he had     One morning with Bluefish and Bertie,      And donkey-licked both of 'em bad.     And when the old horse had departed,      The life on the station grew tame;     The race-track was dull and deserted,      The boys had gone back on the game.           .   .   .   .   .       The winter rolled by, and the station      Was green with the garland of spring     A spirit of glad exultation      Awoke in each animate thing.     And all the old love, the old longing,      Broke out in the breasts of the boys,     The visions of racing came thronging      With all its delirious joys.       The rushing of floods in their courses,      The rattle of rain on the roofs     Recalled the fierce rush of the horses,      The thunder of galloping hoofs.     And soon one broke out:  'I can suffer      No longer the life of a slug,     The man that don't race is a duffer,      Let's have one more run for the mug.       'Why, _EVERYTHING_ races, no matter      Whatever its method may be:     The waterfowl hold a regatta;      The 'possums run heats up a tree;     The emus are constantly sprinting      A handicap out on the plain;     It seems like all nature was hinting,      'Tis time to be at it again.       'The cockatoo parrots are talking      Of races to far away lands;     The native companions are walking      A go-as-you-please on the sands;     The little foals gallop for pastime;      The wallabies race down the gap;     Let's try it once more for the last time,      Bring out the old jacket and cap.       'And now for a horse; we might try one      Of those that are bred on the place,     But I think it better to buy one,      A horse that has proved he can race.     Let us send down to Sydney to Skinner,      A thorough good judge who can ride,     And ask him to buy us a spinner      To clean out the whole countryside.'       They wrote him a letter as follows:      'We want you to buy us a horse;     He must have the speed to catch swallows,      And stamina with it of course.     The price ain't a thing that'll grieve us,      It's getting a bad 'un annoys     The undersigned blokes, and believe us,      We're yours to a cinder, 'the boys'.'       He answered:  'I've bought you a hummer,      A horse that has never been raced;     I saw him run over the Drummer,      He held him outclassed and outpaced.     His breeding's not known, but they state he      Is born of a thoroughbred strain,     I paid them a hundred and eighty,      And started the horse in the train.'       They met him -- alas, that these verses      Aren't up to the subject's demands --     Can't set forth their eloquent curses,      _FOR PARTNER WAS BACK ON THEIR HANDS_.     They went in to meet him in gladness,      They opened his box with delight --     A silent procession of sadness      They crept to the station at night.       And life has grown dull on the station,      The boys are all silent and slow;     Their work is a daily vexation,      And sport is unknown to them now.     Whenever they think how they stranded,      They squeal just like guinea-pigs squeal;     They bit their own hook, and were landed      With fifty pounds loss on the deal.          An Idyll of Dandaloo           On Western plains, where shade is not,      'Neath summer skies of cloudless blue,     Where all is dry and all is hot,      There stands the town of Dandaloo --     A township where life's total sum     Is sleep, diversified with rum.       It's grass-grown streets with dust are deep,      'Twere vain endeavour to express     The dreamless silence of its sleep,      Its wide, expansive drunkenness.     The yearly races mostly drew     A lively crowd to Dandaloo.       There came a sportsman from the East,      The eastern land where sportsmen blow,     And brought with him a speedy beast --      A speedy beast as horses go.     He came afar in hope to 'do'     The little town of Dandaloo.       Now this was weak of him, I wot --      Exceeding weak, it seemed to me --     For we in Dandaloo were not      The Jugginses we seemed to be;     In fact, we rather thought we knew     Our book by heart in Dandaloo.       We held a meeting at the bar,      And met the question fair and square --     'We've stumped the country near and far      To raise the cash for races here;     We've got a hundred pounds or two --     Not half so bad for Dandaloo.       'And now, it seems, we have to be      Cleaned out by this here Sydney bloke,     With his imported horse; and he      Will scoop the pool and leave us broke     Shall we sit still, and make no fuss     While this chap climbs all over us?'           .   .   .   .   .       The races came to Dandaloo,      And all the cornstalks from the West,     On ev'ry kind of moke and screw,      Came forth in all their glory drest.     The stranger's horse, as hard as nails,     Look'd fit to run for New South Wales.       He won the race by half a length --      _QUITE_ half a length, it seemed to me --     But Dandaloo, with all its strength,      Roared out 'Dead heat!' most fervently;     And, after hesitation meet,     The judge's verdict was 'Dead heat!'       And many men there were could tell      What gave the verdict extra force:     The stewards, and the judge as well --      They all had backed the second horse.     For things like this they sometimes do     In larger towns than Dandaloo.       They ran it off; the stranger won,      Hands down, by near a hundred yards     He smiled to think his troubles done;      But Dandaloo held all the cards.     They went to scale and -- cruel fate! --     His jockey turned out under-weight.       Perhaps they'd tampered with the scale!      I cannot tell.  I only know     It weighed him _OUT_ all right.  I fail      To paint that Sydney sportsman's woe.     He said the stewards were a crew     Of low-lived thieves in Dandaloo.       He lifted up his voice, irate,      And swore till all the air was blue;     So then we rose to vindicate      The dignity of Dandaloo.     'Look here,' said we, 'you must not poke     Such oaths at us poor country folk.'       We rode him softly on a rail,      We shied at him, in careless glee,     Some large tomatoes, rank and stale,      And eggs of great antiquity --     Their wild, unholy fragrance flew     About the town of Dandaloo.       He left the town at break of day,      He led his race-horse through the streets,     And now he tells the tale, they say,      To every racing man he meets.     And Sydney sportsmen all eschew     The atmosphere of Dandaloo.          The Geebung Polo Club           It was somewhere up the country, in a land of rock and scrub,     That they formed an institution called the Geebung Polo Club.

COWBOY SONGS    AND OTHER FRONTIER BALLADS          THE DYING COWBOY[1]        \"O bury me not on the lone prairie,\"    These words came low and mournfully    From the pallid lips of a youth who lay    On his dying bed at the close of day.      He had wailed in pain till o'er his brow    Death's shadows fast were gathering now;    He thought of his home and his loved ones nigh    As the cowboys gathered to see him die.        \"O bury me not on the lone prairie      Where the wild cayotes will howl o'er me,      In a narrow grave just six by three,      O bury me not on the lone prairie.      \"In fancy I listen to the well known words    Of the free, wild winds and the song of the birds;    I think of home and the cottage in the bower    And the scenes I loved in my childhood's hour.      \"It matters not, I've oft been told,    Where the body lies when the heart grows cold;    Yet grant, Oh grant this wish to me,    O bury me not on the lone prairie.        \"O then bury me not on the lone prairie,      In a narrow grave six foot by three,      Where the buffalo paws o'er a prairie sea,      O bury me not on the lone prairie.      \"I've always wished to be laid when I died    In the little churchyard on the green hillside;    By my father's grave, there let mine be,    And bury me not on the lone prairie.      \"Let my death slumber be where my mother's prayer    And a sister's tear will mingle there,    Where my friends can come and weep o'er me;    O bury me not on the lone prairie.        \"O bury me not on the lone prairie      In a narrow grave just six by three,      Where the buzzard waits and the wind blows free;      Then bury me not on the lone prairie.      \"There is another whose tears may be shed    For one who lies on a prairie bed;    It pained me then and it pains me now;--    She has curled these locks, she has kissed this brow.      \"These locks she has curled, shall the rattlesnake kiss?    This brow she has kissed, shall the cold grave press?    For the sake of the loved ones that will weep for me    O bury me not on the lone prairie.        \"O bury me not on the lone prairie      Where the wild cayotes will howl o'er me,      Where the buzzard beats and the wind goes free,      O bury me not on the lone prairie.      \"O bury me not,\" and his voice failed there,    But we took no heed of his dying prayer;    In a narrow grave just six by three    We buried him there on the lone prairie.      Where the dew-drops glow and the butterflies rest,    And the flowers bloom o'er the prairie's crest;    Where the wild cayote and winds sport free    On a wet saddle blanket lay a cowboy-ee.        \"O bury me not on the lone prairie      Where the wild cayotes will howl o'er me,      Where the rattlesnakes hiss and the crow flies free      O bury me not on the lone prairie.\"      O we buried him there on the lone prairie    Where the wild rose blooms and the wind blows free,    O his pale young face nevermore to see,--    For we buried him there on the lone prairie.      Yes, we buried him there on the lone prairie    Where the owl all night hoots mournfully,    And the blizzard beats and the winds blow free    O'er his lowly grave on the lone prairie.      And the cowboys now as they roam the plain,--    For they marked the spot where his bones were lain,--    Fling a handful of roses o'er his grave,    With a prayer to Him who his soul will save.        \"O bury me not on the lone prairie      Where the wolves can howl and growl o'er me;      Fling a handful of roses o'er my grave      With a prayer to Him who my soul will save.\"      [Footnote 1: In this song, as in several others, the chorus should  come in after each stanza. The arrangement followed has been adopted  to illustrate versions current in different sections.]        The Dying Cowboy (Mus. Not.)        \"O bu-ry me not on the lone prai-rie,\"    These words came low ... and mourn-ful-ly ...    From the pal-lid lips of a youth who lay    On his dy-ing bed at the close of day.          THE DAYS OF FORTY-NINE        We are gazing now on old Tom Moore,    A relic of bygone days;    'Tis a bummer, too, they call me now,    But what cares I for praise?    It's oft, says I, for the days gone by,    It's oft do I repine    For the days of old when we dug out the gold    In those days of Forty-Nine.      My comrades they all loved me well,    The jolly, saucy crew;    A few hard cases, I will admit,    Though they were brave and true.    Whatever the pinch, they ne'er would flinch;    They never would fret nor whine,    Like good old bricks they stood the kicks    In the days of Forty-Nine.      There's old \"Aunt Jess,\" that hard old cuss,    Who never would repent;    He never missed a single meal,    Nor never paid a cent.    But old \"Aunt Jess,\" like all the rest,    At death he did resign,    And in his bloom went up the flume    In the days of Forty-Nine.      There is Ragshag Jim, the roaring man,    Who could out-roar a buffalo, you bet,    He roared all day and he roared all night,    And I guess he is roaring yet.    One night Jim fell in a prospect hole,--    It was a roaring bad design,--    And in that hole Jim roared out his soul    In the days of Forty-Nine.      There is Wylie Bill, the funny man,    Who was full of funny tricks,    And when he was in a poker game    He was always hard as bricks.    He would ante you a stud, he would play you a draw,    He'd go you a hatful blind,--    In a struggle with death Bill lost his breath    In the days of Forty-Nine.      There was New York Jake, the butcher boy,    Who was fond of getting tight.    And every time he got on a spree    He was spoiling for a fight.    One night Jake rampaged against a knife    In the hands of old Bob Sine,    And over Jake they held a wake    In the days of Forty-Nine.      There was Monte Pete, I'll ne'er forget    The luck he always had,    He would deal for you both day and night    Or as long as he had a scad.    It was a pistol shot that lay Pete out,    It was his last resign,    And it caught Pete dead sure in the door    In the days of Forty-Nine.      Of all the comrades that I've had    There's none that's left to boast,    And I am left alone in my misery    Like some poor wandering ghost.    And as I pass from town to town,    They call me the rambling sign,    Since the days of old and the days of gold    And the days of Forty-Nine.        Days of Forty-Nine (Mus. Not.)        You are gaz-ing now on old Tom Moore, A    rel-ic of by-gone days; 'Tis a bum-mer now they    call me. But what cares I for praise; It is    oft, says I, for days gone by, It's oft do I repine    For those days of old when we dug out the gold, In the    days of For-ty-nine, In those days of old when we    dug out the gold, In the days of For-ty-nine.          JOE BOWERS        My name is Joe Bowers,    I've got a brother Ike,    I came here from Missouri,    Yes, all the way from Pike.    I'll tell you why I left there    And how I came to roam,    And leave my poor old mammy,    So far away from home.      I used to love a gal there,    Her name was Sallie Black,    I asked her for to marry me,    She said it was a whack.    She says to me, \"Joe Bowers,    Before you hitch for life,    You ought to have a little home    To keep your little wife.\"      Says I, \"My dearest Sallie,    O Sallie, for your sake,    I'll go to California    And try to raise a stake.\"    Says she to me, \"Joe Bowers,    You are the chap to win,    Give me a kiss to seal the bargain,\"--    And I throwed a dozen in.      I'll never forget my feelings    When I bid adieu to all.    Sal, she cotched me round the neck    And I began to bawl.    When I begun they all commenced,    You never heard the like,    How they all took on and cried    The day I left old Pike.      When I got to this here country    I hadn't nary a red,    I had such wolfish feelings    I wished myself most dead.    At last I went to mining,    Put in my biggest licks,    Came down upon the boulders    Just like a thousand bricks.      I worked both late and early    In rain and sun and snow,    But I was working for my Sallie    So 'twas all the same to Joe.    I made a very lucky strike    As the gold itself did tell,    For I was working for my Sallie,    The girl I loved so well.      But one day I got a letter    From my dear, kind brother Ike;    It came from old Missouri,    Yes, all the way from Pike.    It told me the goldarndest news    That ever you did hear,    My heart it is a-bustin'    So please excuse this tear.      I'll tell you what it was, boys,    You'll bust your sides I know;    For when I read that letter    You ought to seen poor Joe.    My knees gave 'way beneath me,    And I pulled out half my hair;    And if you ever tell this now,    You bet you'll hear me swear.      It said my Sallie was fickle,    Her love for me had fled,    That she had married a butcher,    Whose hair was awful red;    It told me more than that,    It's enough to make me swear,--    It said that Sallie had a baby    And the baby had red hair.      Now I've told you all that I can tell    About this sad affair,    'Bout Sallie marrying the butcher    And the baby had red hair.    But whether it was a boy or girl    The letter never said,    It only said its cussed hair    Was inclined to be red.          THE COWBOY'S DREAM[2]        Last night as I lay on the prairie,    And looked at the stars in the sky,    I wondered if ever a cowboy    Would drift to that sweet by and by.        Roll on, roll on;      Roll on, little dogies, roll on, roll on,      Roll on, roll on;      Roll on, little dogies, roll on.      The road to that bright, happy region    Is a dim, narrow trail, so they say;    But the broad one that leads to perdition    Is posted and blazed all the way.      They say there"]]]
