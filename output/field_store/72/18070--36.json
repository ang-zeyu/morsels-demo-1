After a while he thought he should like to go quicker, so  he began to click with his tongue and to cry \"Gee-up!\" And the horse  began to trot, and Hans was thrown before he knew what was going to  happen, and there he lay in the ditch by the side of the road. The horse  would have got away but that he was caught by a peasant who was passing  that way and driving a cow before him. And Hans pulled himself together  and got upon his feet, feeling very vexed. \"Poor work, riding,\" said he,  \"especially on a jade like this, who starts off and throws you before  you know where you are, going near to break your neck; never shall I try  that game again; now, your cow is something worth having, one can jog on  comfortably after her and have her milk, butter, and cheese every day,  into the bargain. What would I not give to have such a cow!\"    \"Well now,\" said the peasant, \"since it will be doing you such a favour,  I don't mind exchanging my cow for your horse.\"    Hans agreed most joyfully, and the peasant, swinging himself into the  saddle, was soon out of sight.    And Hans went along driving his cow quietly before him, and thinking all  the while of the fine bargain he had made.    \"With only a piece of bread I shall have everything I can possibly want,  for I shall always be able to have butter and cheese to it, and if I am  thirsty I have nothing to do but to milk my cow; and what more is there  for heart to wish!\"    And when he came to an inn he made a halt, and in the joy of his heart  ate up all the food he had brought with him, dinner and supper and all,  and bought half a glass of beer with his last two farthings. Then on he  went again driving his cow, until he should come to the village where  his mother lived. It was now near the middle of the day, and the sun  grew hotter and hotter, and Hans found himself on a heath which it would  be an hour's journey to cross. And he began to feel very hot, and so  thirsty that his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.    \"Never mind,\" said Hans; \"I can find a remedy. I will milk my cow at  once.\" And tying her to a dry tree, and taking off his leather cap to  serve for a pail, he began to milk, but not a drop came. And as he set  to work rather awkwardly, the impatient beast gave him such a kick on  the head with his hind foot that he fell to the ground, and for some  time could not think where he was; when luckily there came by a butcher  who was wheeling along a young pig in a wheelbarrow.    \"Here's a fine piece of work!\" cried he, helping poor Hans on his legs  again. Then Hans related to him all that had happened; and the butcher  handed him his pocket-flask, saying,    \"Here, take a drink, and be a man again; of course the cow would give no  milk; she is old and only fit to draw burdens, or to be slaughtered.\"    \"Well, to be sure,\" said Hans, scratching his head. \"Who would have  thought it? of course it is a very handy way of getting meat when a man  has a beast of his own to kill; but for my part I do not care much about  cow beef, it is rather tasteless. Now, if I had but a young pig, that is  much better meat, and then the sausages!\"    \"Look here, Hans,\" said the butcher, \"just for love of you I will  exchange, and will give you my pig instead of your cow.\"    \"Heaven reward such kindness!\" cried Hans, and handing over the cow,  received in exchange the pig, who was turned out of his wheelbarrow and  was to be led by a string.    So on went Hans, thinking how everything turned out according to his  wishes, and how, if trouble overtook him, all was sure to be set right  directly. After a while he fell in with a peasant, who was carrying a  fine white goose under his arm. They bid each other good-day, and Hans  began to tell about his luck, and how he had made so many good  exchanges. And the peasant told how he was taking the goose to a  christening feast.    \"Just feel how heavy it is,\" said he, taking it up by the wings; \"it has  been fattening for the last eight weeks; and when it is roasted, won't  the fat run down!\"    \"Yes, indeed,\" said Hans, weighing it in his hand, \"very fine to be  sure; but my pig is not to be despised.\"    Upon which the peasant glanced cautiously on all sides, and shook his  head.    \"I am afraid,\" said he, \"that there is something not quite right about  your pig. In the village I have just left one had actually been stolen  from the bailiff's yard. I fear, I fear you have it in your hand; they  have sent after the thief, and it would be a bad look-out for you if it  was found upon you; the least that could happen would be to be thrown  into a dark hole.\"    Poor Hans grew pale with fright. \"For heaven's sake,\" said he, \"help me  out of this scrape, I am a stranger in these parts; take my pig and give  me your goose.\"    \"It will be running some risk,\" answered the man, \"but I will do it  sooner than that you should come to grief.\" And so, taking the cord in  his hand, he drove the pig quickly along a by-path, and lucky Hans went  on his way home with the goose under his arm. \"The more I think of it,\"  said he to himself, \"the better the bargain seems; first I get the roast  goose; then the fat; that will last a whole year for bread and dripping;  and lastly the beautiful white feathers which I can stuff my pillow  with; how comfortably I shall sleep upon it, and how pleased my mother  will be!\"    And when he reached the last village, he saw a knife-grinder with his  barrow; and his wheel went whirring round, and he sang,        \"My scissors I grind, and my wheel I turn;      And all good fellows my trade should learn,      For all that I meet with just serves my turn.\"    And Hans stood and looked at him; and at last he spoke to him and said,    \"You seem very well off, and merry with your grinding.\"    \"Yes,\" answered the knife-grinder, \"my handiwork pays very well. I call  a man a good grinder who, every time he puts his hand in his pocket  finds money there. But where did you buy that fine goose?\"    \"I did not buy it, but I exchanged it for my pig,\" said Hans.    \"And the pig?\"    \"That I exchanged for a cow.\"    \"And the cow?\"    \"That I exchanged for a horse.\"    \"And the horse?\"    \"I gave for the horse a lump of gold as big as my head.\"    \"And the gold?\"    \"Oh, that was my wage for seven years' service.\"    \"You seem to have fended for yourself very well,\" said the  knife-grinder. \"Now, if you could but manage to have money in your  pocket every time you put your hand in, your fortune is made.\"    \"How shall I manage that?\" said Hans.    \"You must be a knife-grinder like me,\" said the man. \"All you want is a  grindstone, the rest comes of itself: I have one here; to be sure it is  a little damaged, but I don't mind letting you have it in exchange for  your goose; what say you?\"    \"How can you ask?\" answered Hans. \"I shall be the luckiest fellow in the  world, for if I find money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, there is  nothing more left to want.\"    And so he handed over the goose to the pedlar and received the  grindstone in exchange.    \"Now,\" said the knife-grinder, taking up a heavy common stone that lay  near him, \"here is another proper sort of stone that will stand a good  deal of wear and that you can hammer out your old nails upon. Take it  with you, and carry it carefully.\"    Hans lifted up the stone and carried it off with a contented mind. \"I  must have been born under a lucky star!\" cried he, while his eyes  sparkled for joy. \"I have only to wish for a thing and it is mine.\"    After a while he began to feel rather tired, as indeed he had been on  his legs since daybreak; he also began to feel rather hungry, as in the  fulness of his joy at getting the cow, he had eaten up all he had. At  last he could scarcely go on at all, and had to make a halt every  moment, for the stones weighed him down most unmercifully, and he could  not help wishing that he did not feel obliged to drag them along. And on  he went at a snail's pace until he came to a well; then he thought he  would rest and take a drink of the fresh water. And he placed the stones  carefully by his side at the edge of the well; then he sat down, and as  he stooped to drink, he happened to give the stones a little push, and  they both fell into the water with a splash. And then Hans, having  watched them disappear, jumped for joy, and thanked his stars that he  had been so lucky as to get rid of the stones that had weighed upon him  so long without any effort of his own.    \"I really think,\" cried he, \"I am the luckiest man under the sun.\" So on  he went, void of care, until he reached his mother's house.          THE GOOSE GIRL.      THERE lived once an old Queen, whose husband had been dead many years.  She had a beautiful daughter who was promised in marriage to a King's  son living a great way off. When the time appointed for the wedding drew  near, and the old Queen had to send her daughter into the foreign land,  she got together many costly things, furniture and cups and jewels and  adornments, both of gold and silver, everything proper for the dowry of  a royal Princess, for she loved her daughter dearly. She gave her also a  waiting gentlewoman to attend her and to give her into the bridegroom's  hands; and they were each to have a horse for the journey, and the  Princess's horse was named Falada, and he could speak. When the time for  parting came, the old Queen took her daughter to her chamber, and with a  little knife she cut her own finger so that it bled; and she held  beneath it a white napkin, and on it fell three drops of blood; and she  gave it to her daughter, bidding her take care of it, for it would be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#4)"],[1,"nodded to the man waiting there. He was a  flat-faced Eucorian of the servant caste, and now he reached out to  draw Lansor over the threshold.    \"I have him, gentlehomo.\" His voice was as expressionless as his face.  There was another shimmer and the door disappeared.    Hume brushed his hand down the outer side of his thigh, wiping flesh  against the coarse stuff of the crew uniform. He left the lobby  frowning at his own thoughts.    Stupid! A swamper from one of the worst rat holes in the port. Like as  not that youngster would have had his brains kicked out in a brawl, or  been fried to a crisp when some drunk got wild with a blaster, before  the year was out. He'd done him a real kindness, given him a chance at  a future less than one man in a billion ever had the power to even  dream about. Why, if Vye Lansor had known what was going to happen to  him, he would have been so willing to volunteer, that he would have  dragged Hume here. There was no reason to have any regrets over the  boy, he had never had it so good--never! There was only one small  period of risk for Vye to face. Those days he would have to spend  alone on Jumala between the time Wass' organization would plant him  there and the coming of Hume's party to \"discover\" him. Hume himself  would tape every possible aid to cover that period. All the knowledge  of a Guild Out-Hunter, added to the information gathered by the  survey, would be used to provide Rynch Brodie with the training  necessary for wilderness survival. Hume was already listing the items  to be included as he strode down the street, his tread once more  assured.          3      His head ached dully, of that he was conscious first. As he turned,  without opening his eyes, he felt the brush of softness against his  cheek, and a pungent odor fill his nostrils.    He opened his eyes, stared up past a rim of broken rock toward the  cloudless, blue-green sky. A relay clicked into proper place deep in  his mind.    Of course! He had been trying to lure a strong-jaws out of its  traphole with hooked bait, then his foot had slipped. Rynch Brodie sat  up, flexed his bare thin arms, and moved his long legs experimentally.  No broken bones, anyway. But still he frowned. Odd--that dream which  jarred with the here and now.    Crawling to the side of the creek, he dipped head and shoulders into  the water, letting the chill of the stream flush away some of his  waking bewilderment. He shook himself, making the drops fly from his  uncovered torso and arms, and then discovered his hunting tackle.    He stood for a moment fingering each piece of his scanty clothing,  recalling every piece of labor or battle which had added pouch, belt,  strip of fabric to his equipment. Yet--there was still that odd sense  of strangeness, as if none of this was really his.    Rynch shook his head, wiped his wet face with his arm. It was all his,  that was sure, every bit of it. He'd been lucky, the survival manual  on the L-B had furnished him with general directions and this was a  world which was not unfriendly--not if one was prepared for trouble.    He climbed up and loosened the net, coiling its folds into one hand,  taking the good spear in his other. A bush stirred ahead, against the  pull of the light breeze. Rynch froze, then the haft of his spear slid  into a new hand grip, the coils of his net spun out. A snarl cut over  the purr of water.    The scarlet blot which sprang for his throat was met with the flail of  the net. Rynch stabbed twice at the creature he had so swept off  balance. A water-cat, this year's cub. Dying, its claws, over-long in  proportion to its paws, drew inch deep furrows in the earth and  gravel. Its eyes, almost the same shade as its long, burr-entangled  body fur, glared up at him in deathly enmity.    As Rynch watched, that feeling that he was studying something strange,  utterly alien, came to him once again. Yet he had hunted water-cats  for many seasons. Fortunately they were solitary, evil-tempered beasts  that marked out a roaming territory to defend it from others of their  kind, and not too many were to be encountered in cross-country travel.    He stooped to pull his net from the now still paws. Some definite  place he must reach. The compulsion to move on in that sudden flash  shook him, raised the dull ache still troubling his temples into a  punishing throb. Going down on his knees, Rynch once more turned to  the stream water; this time after splashing it onto his face, he drank  from his cupped hands.    Rynch swayed, his wet hands over his eyes, digging fingertips into the  skin of his forehead to ease that pain bursting in his skull. Sitting  in a room, drinking from a cup--it was as if a shadow picture fitted  over the reality of the stream, rocks and brush about him. He had sat  in a room, had drank from a cup--that action had been important!    A sharp, hot pain made him lose contact with that shadow. He looked  down. From the gravel, from under rocks, gathered an army of  blue-black, hard-shelled things, their clawed forelimbs extended, blue  sense organs raised on fleshy stalks well above their heads, all  turned towards the dead feline.    Rynch slapped out vigorously, stumbled into the water loosening the  hold of two vicious scavengers on the torn skin of his ankle when he  waded out knee-deep. Already that black tongue of small bodies licked  across the red-haired side of the hunter. Within minutes the corpse  would be only well-cleaned bones.    Retrieving his spear and net, Rynch immersed both in the water to  clean off attackers, and hurried on, splashing through the creek until  he was well away from the vicinity of the kill. A little later he  flushed a four-footed creature from between two rocks and killed it  with one blow from his spear haft. He skinned his kill, feeling the  substance of the skill. Was it exceedingly rough hide, or rudimentary  scales? And knew a return of that puzzlement.    He felt, he thought painfully as he toasted the dry looking, grayish  meat on a sharpened stick, as if a part of him knew very well what  manner of animal he had killed. And yet, far inside him, another  person he could not understand stood aloof watching in amazement.    He was Rynch Brodie, and he had been traveling on the Largo Drift with  his mother.    Memory presented him automatically with a picture of a thin woman with  a narrow, rather unhappy face, a twist of elaborately dressed hair in  which jeweled lights sparkled. There had been something bad--memory  was no longer exact but chaotic. And his head ached as he tried to  recall that time with greater clarity. Afterwards the L-B and a man  with him in it--    \"Simmons Tait!\"    An officer, badly hurt. He had died when the L-B landed here. Rynch  had a clear memory of himself piling rocks over Tait's twisted body.  He had been alone then with only the survival manual and some of the  L-B supplies. The important thing was that he must never forget he was  Rynch Brodie.    He licked grease from his fingers. The ache in his head made him  drowsy. He curled up on a patch of sun-warmed sand and slept.    Or did he? His eyes were open again. Now the sky above him was no  longer a bowl of light, but rather a muted halo of evening. Rynch sat  up, his heart pounding as if he had been racing to outdistance the  rising wind now pushing against his half-naked body.    What was he doing here? Where _was_ here?    Panic, carried through from that awakening, dried his mouth, roughened  his skin, made wet the palms of the hands he dug into the sand on  either side of him. Vaguely, a picture projected into his mind--he had  sat in a room, and watched a man come to him with a cup. Before that,  he had been in a place of garish light and evil smells.    But he was Rynch Brodie, he had come here on an L-B when he was a boy,  he had buried the ship's officer under a pile of rocks, managed to  survive by himself because he had applied the aids in the boat to  learn how. This morning he had been hunting a strong-jaw, tempting it  out of its hiding by a hook and line and a bait of fresh killed  skipper.    Rynch's hands went to his face, he crouched forward on his knees. That  all was true, he could prove it--he would prove it! There was the  strong-jaw's den back there, somewhere on the rise where he had left  the snapped haft of the spear he had broken in his fall. If he could  find the den, then he would be sure of the reality of everything else.    He had only had a very real dream--that was it! Only, why did he  continue to dream of that room, that man, and the cup? Of the place of  lights and smells, which he hated so much that the hate was a sour  taste in his fright-dried mouth? None of it had ever been a part of  Rynch Brodie's world.    Through the dusk he started back up the stream bed, towards the narrow  little valley where he had wakened after that fall. Finally, finding  shelter within the heart of a bush, he crouched low, listening to the  noises of another world which awoke at night to take over the stage  from the day dwellers.    As he plodded back, he fought off panic, realizing that some of those  noises he could identify with confidence, while others remained  mysteries. He bit down hard on the knuckles of his clenched fist,  attempting to bend that discovery into evidence. Why did he know at  once that that thin, eerie wailing was the flock call of a  leather-winged, feathered tree dweller, and that a coughing grunt from  downstream was just a noise?    \"Rynch Brodie--Largo Drift--Tait.\" He tasted the blood his teeth drew  from his own skin as he recited that formula. Then he scrambled up.  His feet tangled in the net, and he went down again, his head cracking  on a protruding root.    Nothing tangible reached him in that brush shelter. What did venture  out of hiding to investigate was a substance none of his species could  have named. It was neither body, nor mind--perhaps it was"]]]
