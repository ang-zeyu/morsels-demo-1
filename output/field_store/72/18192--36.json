[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781"],[0,"Heidi (#4)"],[1," consoled herself with the thought that she would be  able to do more for the child if she could earn some money. She was  very glad to go away from people who interfered in her affairs, and  looked forward with great delight to her new place.    [Illustration]          II    WITH THE GRANDFATHER      After Deta had disappeared, the Uncle sat down again on the bench,  blowing big clouds of smoke out of his pipe. He did not speak, but  kept his eyes fastened on the ground. In the meantime Heidi looked  about her, and discovering the goat-shed, peeped in. Nothing could be  seen inside. Searching for some more interesting thing, she saw the  three old fir-trees behind the hut. Here the wind was roaring through  the branches and the tree-tops were swaying to and fro. Heidi stood  still to listen. After the wind had ceased somewhat, she walked round  the hut back to her grandfather. She found him in exactly the same  position, and planting herself in front of the old man, with arms  folded behind her back, she gazed at him. The grandfather, looking up,  saw the child standing motionless before him. \"What do you want to do  now?\" he asked her.    \"I want to see what's in the hut,\" replied Heidi.    \"Come then,\" and with that the grandfather got up and entered the  cottage.    \"Take your things along,\" he commanded.    \"I do not want them any more,\" answered Heidi.    The old man, turning about, threw a penetrating glance at her. The  child's black eyes were sparkling in expectation of all the things to  come. \"She is not lacking in intelligence,\" he muttered to himself.  Aloud he added: \"Why don't you need them any more?\"    \"I want to go about like the light-footed goats!\"    \"All right, you can; but fetch the things and we'll put them in the  cupboard.\" The child obeyed the command. The old man now opened the  door, and Heidi followed him into a fairly spacious room, which took  in the entire expanse of the hut. In one corner stood a table and a  chair, and in another the grandfather's bed. Across the room a large  kettle was suspended over the hearth, and opposite to it a large door  was sunk into the wall. This the grandfather opened. It was the  cupboard, in which all his clothes were kept. In one shelf were a few  shirts, socks and towels; on another a few plates, cups and glasses;  and on the top shelf Heidi could see a round loaf of bread, some bacon  and cheese. In this cupboard the grandfather kept everything that he  needed for his subsistence. When he opened it, Heidi pushed her things  as far behind the grandfather's clothes as she could reach. She did  not want them found again in a hurry. After looking around attentively  in the room, she asked, \"Where am I going to sleep, grandfather?\"    \"Wherever you want to,\" he replied. That suited Heidi exactly. She  peeped into all the corners of the room and looked at every little  nook to find a cosy place to sleep. Beside the old man's bed she saw a  ladder. Climbing up, she arrived at a hayloft, which was filled with  fresh and fragrant hay. Through a tiny round window she could look far  down into the valley.       [Illustration: HERE A NEAT LITTLE BED WAS PREPARED]    \"I want to sleep up here,\" Heidi called down. \"Oh, it is lovely here.  Please come up, grandfather, and see it for yourself.\"    \"I know it,\" sounded from below.    \"I am making the bed now,\" the little girl called out again, while she  ran busily to and fro. \"Oh, do come up and bring a sheet, grandfather,  for every bed must have a sheet.\"    \"Is that so?\" said the old man. After a while he opened the cupboard  and rummaged around in it. At last he pulled out a long coarse cloth  from under the shirts. It somewhat resembled a sheet, and with this he  climbed up to the loft. Here a neat little bed was already prepared.  On top the hay was heaped up high so that the head of the occupant  would lie exactly opposite the window.    The grandfather was well pleased with the arrangement. To prevent the  hard floor from being felt, he made the couch twice as thick. Then he  and Heidi together put the heavy sheet on, tucking the ends in well.  Heidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh, new bed and said,  \"Grandfather, we have forgotten something.\"    \"What?\" he asked.    \"I have no cover. When I go to bed I always creep in between the sheet  and the cover.\"    \"What shall we do if I haven't any?\" asked the grandfather.    \"Never mind, I'll just take some more hay to cover me,\" Heidi  reassured him, and was just going to the heap of hay when the old man  stopped her.    \"Just wait one minute,\" he said, and went down to his own bed. From it  he took a large, heavy linen bag and brought it to the child.    \"Isn't this better than hay?\" he asked.    Heidi pulled the sack to and fro with all her might, but she could not  unfold it, for it was too heavy for her little arms. The grandfather  put the thick cover on the bed while Heidi watched him. After it was  all done, she said: \"What a nice bed I have now, and what a splendid  cover! I only wish the evening was here, that I might go to sleep in  it.\"    \"I think we might eat something first,\" said the grandfather. \"Don't  you think so?\"    Heidi had forgotten everything else in her interest for the bed; but  when she was reminded of her dinner, she noticed how terribly hungry  she really was. She had had only a piece of bread and a cup of thin  coffee very early in the morning, before her long journey. Heidi said  approvingly: \"I think we might, grandfather!\"    \"Let's go down then, if we agree,\" said the old man, and followed  close behind her. Going up to the fireplace, he pushed the big kettle  aside and reached for a smaller one that was suspended on a chain.  Then sitting down on a three-legged stool, he kindled a bright fire.  When the kettle was boiling, the old man put a large piece of cheese  on a long iron fork, and held it over the fire, turning it to and fro,  till it was golden-brown on all sides. Heidi had watched him eagerly.  Suddenly she ran to the cupboard. When her grandfather brought a pot  and the toasted cheese to the table, he found it already nicely set  with two plates and two knives and the bread in the middle. Heidi had  seen the things in the cupboard and knew that they would be needed for  the meal.    \"I am glad to see that you can think for yourself,\" said the  grandfather, while he put the cheese on top of the bread, \"but  something is missing yet.\"    Heidi saw the steaming pot and ran back to the cupboard in all haste.  A single little bowl was on the shelf. That did not perplex Heidi  though, for she saw two glasses standing behind. With those three  things she returned to the table.    \"You certainly can help yourself! Where shall you sit, though?\" asked  the grandfather, who occupied the only chair himself, Heidi flew to  the hearth, and bringing back the little stool, sat down on it.    \"Now you have a seat, but it is much too low. In fact, you are too  little to reach the table from my chair. Now you shall have something  to eat at last!\" and with that the grandfather filled the little bowl  with milk. Putting it on his chair, he pushed it as near to the stool  as was possible, and in that way Heidi had a table before her. He  commanded her to eat the large piece of bread and the slice of golden  cheese. He sat down himself on a corner of the table and started his  own dinner. Heidi drank without stopping, for she felt exceedingly  thirsty after her long journey. Taking a long breath, she put down her  little bowl.    \"How do you like the milk?\" the grandfather asked her.    \"I never tasted better,\" answered Heidi.    \"Then you shall have more,\" and with that the grandfather filled the  little bowl again. The little girl ate and drank with the greatest  enjoyment. After she was through, both went out into the goat-shed.  Here the old man busied himself, and Heidi watched him attentively  while he was sweeping and putting down fresh straw for the goats to  sleep on. Then he went to the little shop alongside and fashioned a  high chair for Heidi, to the little girl's greatest amazement.    \"What is this?\" asked the grandfather.    \"This is a chair for me. I am sure of it because it is so high. How  quickly it was made!\" said the child, full of admiration and wonder.    \"She knows what is what and has her eyes on the right place,\" the  grandfather said to himself, while he walked around the hut, fastening  a nail or a loose board here and there. He wandered about with his  hammer and nails, repairing whatever was in need of fixing. Heidi  followed him at every step and watched the performance with great  enjoyment and attention.    At last the evening came. The old fir-trees were rustling and a mighty  wind was roaring and howling through the tree-tops. Those sounds  thrilled Heidi's heart and filled it with happiness and joy. She  danced and jumped about under the trees, for those sounds made her  feel as if a wonderful thing had happened to her. The grandfather  stood under the door, watching her, when suddenly a shrill whistle was  heard. Heidi stood still and the grandfather joined her outside. Down  from the heights came one goat after another, with Peter in their  midst. Uttering a cry of joy, Heidi ran into the middle of the flock,  greeting her old friends. When they had all reached the hut, they  stopped on their way and two beautiful slender goats came out of the  herd, one of them white and the other brown. They came up to the  grandfather, who held out some salt in his hands to them, as he did  every night. Heidi tenderly caressed first one and then the other,  seeming beside herself with joy.    \"Are they ours, grandfather? Do they both belong to us? Are they going  to the stable? Are they going to stay with us?\" Heidi kept on asking  in her excitement. The grandfather hardly could put in a \"yes, yes,  surely\" between her numerous questions. When the goats had licked up  all the salt, the old man said, \"Go"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20785"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#4)"],[1,"up in the night,  all covered with white spreads, they was something bound to happen.    Them way back days is gone and I is mighty glad. The Negroes of today  needs another leader like Booker Washington.

Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves    LEWIS BONNER  Age 87 yrs.  507 N. Durland  Oklahoma City, Oklahoma      I was born 7 miles north of Palestine, Texas, on Matt Swanson's place  in 1850, but I kin not remember the date. My mistress was name Celia  Swanson. My mistress was so good to me till I jest loved her.    My family and all slaves on our place was treated good. Mighty few  floggings went on 'round and about. Master was the overseer over his  darkies and didn't use no other'n. I waited table and churned in the  Big House.    I ate at the table with my mistress and her family and nothing was  evah said. We ate bacon, greens, Irish potatoes and such as we git  now. Aunt Chaddy was the cook and nurse for all the chillun on the  place.    We used to hear slaves on de other places hollering from whippings,  but master never whipped his niggers 'less they lied. Sometimes slaves  from other places would run off and come to our place. Master would  take them back and tell the slave-holders how to treat them so dey  wouldn't run off again.    Mistress had a little stool for me in the big house, and if I got  sleepy, she put me on the foot of her bed and I stayed there til  morning, got up washed my face and hands and got ready to wait on the  table.    There was four or five hundred slaves on our place. One morning during  slavery, my father killed 18 white men and ran away. They said he was  lazy and whipped him, and he just killed all of 'em he could, which  was 18 of 'em. He stayed away 3 years without being found. He come  back and killed 7 before they could kill him. When he was on the place  he jest made bluing.    My mother worked in the field and weaved cloth. Shirts dat she made  lasted 12 months, even if wore and washed and ironed every day. Pants  could not be ripped with two men pulling on dem with all their might.  You talking 'bout clothes, them was some clothes then. Clothes made  now jest don't come up to them near abouts.    Doing of slavery, we had the best church, lots better than today. I am  a Baptist from head to foot, yes sir, yes sir. Jest couldn't be  nothing else. In the first place, I wouldn't even try.    I knows when the war started and ceaseted. I tell you it was some war.  When it was all over, the Yankees come thoo' singing, \"You may die  poor but you won't die a slave.\"    When the War was over, master told us that we could go out and take  care of the crops already planted and plant the ones that need  planting 'cause we knowed all 'bout the place and we would go halvers.  We stayed on 3 years after slavery. We got a little money, but we got  room and board and didn't have to work too hard. It was enough  difference to tell you was no slaves any more.    After slavery and when I was old enough I got married. I married a gal  that was a daughter of her master. He wanted to own her, but she sho'  didn't return it. He kept up with her till he died and sent her money  jest all the time. Before he died, he put her name in his will and  told his oldest son to be sure and keep up with her. The son was sure  true to his promise, for till she died, she was forever hearing from  him or he would visit us, even after we moved to Oklahoma from Texas.    Our chillun and grandchillun will git her part since she is gone. She  was sure a good wife and for no reason did I take the second look at  no woman. That was love, which don't live no more in our hearts.    I make a few pennies selling fish worms and doing a little yard work  and raising vegetables. Not much money in circulation. When I gets my  old age pension, it will make things a little mite better. I guess the  time will be soon.    Tain't nothing but bad treatment that makes people die young and I  ain't had none.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves  [Date stamp: AUG 19 1937]    FRANCIS BRIDGES  Age 73 yrs.  Oklahoma City, Okla.      I was born in Red River County, Texas in 1864, and that makes me 73  years old. I had myself 75, and I went to my white folks and they  counted it up and told me I was 73, but I always felt like I was older  than that.    My husband's name is Henry Bridges. We was raised up children together  and married. I had five sisters. My brother died here in Oklahoma  about two years ago. He was a Fisher. Mary Russell, my sister, she  lives in Parish, Texas; Willie Ann Poke, she lives in Greenville,  Texas; Winnie Jackson, lives in Adonia, Texas, and Mattie White, my  other sister, lives in Long Oak, Texas, White Hunt County.    Our Master was named Master Travis Wright, and we all ate nearly the  same thing. Such things as barbecued rabbits, coon, possums baked with  sweet potatoes and all such as that. I used to hang round the kitchen.  The cook, Mama Winnie Long, used to feed all us little niggers on the  flo', jest like little pigs, in tin cups and wooden spoons. We ate  fish too, and I like to go fishing right this very day.    We lived right in old Master Wright's yard. His house sat way up on a  high hill. It was jest a little old log hut we lived in a little old  shack around the yard. They was a lot of little shacks in the yard, I  can't tell jest how many, but it was quite a number of 'em. We slept  in old-fashion beds that we called \"corded beds\", 'cause they had  ropes crossed to hold the mattresses for slats. Some of 'em had beds  nailed to the wall.    Master Travis Wright had one son named Sam Wright, and after old  Master Travis Wright died, young Master Sam Wright come to be my  mother's master. He jest died a few years ago.    My mother say dey had a nigger driver and he'd whip 'em all but his  daughter. I never seen no slaves whipped, but my mother say dey had to  whip her Uncle Charley Mills once for telling a story. She say he  bored a hole in de wall of de store 'til he bored de hole in old  Master's whiskey barrel, and he caught two jugs of whiskey and buried  it in de banks of de river. When old Master found out de whiskey was  gone, he tried to make Uncle Charley 'fess up, and Uncle Charley  wouldn't so he brung him in and hung him and barely let his toes  touch. After Uncle Charley thought he was going to kill him, he told  where de whiskey was.    We didn't go to church before freedom, land no! 'cause the closest  church was so far--it was 30 miles off. But I'm a member of the  Baptist Church and I've been a member for some 40-odd years. I was  past 40 when I heerd of a Methodist Church. My favorite song is  \"Companion.\" I didn't get to go to school 'til after slavery.    I 'member more after de War. I 'member my mother said dey had  patrollers, and if de slaves would get passes from de Master to go to  de dances and didn't git back before ten o'clock dey'd beat 'em half  to death.    I used to hear 'em talking 'bout Ku Klux Klan coming to the well to  get water. They'd draw up a bucket of water and pour the water in they  false stomachs. They false stomachs was tied on 'em with a big leather  buckle. They'd jest pour de water in there to scare 'em and say, \"This  is the first drink of water I've had since I left Hell.\" They'd say  all sech things to scare the cullud folks.    I heerd my mother say they sold slaves on what they called an auction  block. Jest like if a slave had any portly fine looking children  they'd sell them chillun jest like selling cattle. I didn't see this,  jest heerd it.    After freedom, when I was old enough then to work in the field, we  lived on Mr. Martin's plantation. We worked awful hard in the fields.  Lawd yes'm! I've heard 'bout shucking up de corn, but give me dem  cotton pickings. Fry'd pick out all de crop of cotton in one day. The  women would cook and de men'd pick the cotton, I mean on dem big  cotton pickings. Some would work for they meals. Then after dey'd  gather all de crops, dey'd give big dances, drink whiskey, and jest  cut up sumpin terrible. We didn't know anything 'bout holidays.    I've heard my husband talk 'bout \"Raw head an' bloody bones.\" Said  whenever dey mothers wanted to scare 'em to make 'em be good dey'd  tell 'em dat a man was outside de door and asked her if she'd hold his  head while he fixed his back bone. I don't believe in voodooing, and I  don't believe in hants. I used to believe in both of 'em when I was  young.    I married Jake Bridges. We had a ordinary wedding. The preacher  married us and we had a license. We have two sons grown living here.  My husband told me that in slavery if your Master told you to live  with your brother, you had to live with him. My father's mother and  dad was first cousins.    I can 'member my husband telling me he was hauling lumber from  Jefferson where the saw mill was and it was cold that night, and when  they got halfway back it snowed, and he stopped with an old cullud  family, and he said way in the night, a knock come at de door--woke  'em up, and it was an old cullud man, and he said dis old man commence  inquiring, trying to find out who dey people was and dey told him best  dey could remember, and bless de Lawd, 'fore dey finished talking de  found out dis old cullud man and de other cullud woman an' man dat was  married was all brothers and sisters, and he told his brother it was  a shame he had married his sister and dey had nine chillun. My husband  sho' told me dis.    I've heerd 'em say dey old master raised chillun by those cullud  women. Why, there was one white man in Texas had a cullud woman, but  didn't have no chillun by her, and he had this cullud woman and her  old mistress there on the same place. So, when old Mistress died he  wouldn't let"]]]
