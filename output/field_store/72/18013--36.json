This method will be effective in preventing the breeding of flies  only if the manure is hauled out promptly every morning and spread  thinly so that it will dry, since it is unfavorable for fly development  in desiccated condition. The proper scattering of the manure on the  fields is best and most easily and quickly accomplished by the use of a  manure spreader, and many dairies, and even farms, are practicing the  daily distribution of manure in this way. Removal every three or four  days will not be sufficient. Observations have shown that if manure  becomes flyblown and the maggots attain a fairly good size before the  manure is scattered on the fields, they can continue their development  and will pupate in the ground.      CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF MANURE TO DESTROY FLY MAGGOTS.    During the summer months, when fly breeding is going on most actively,  the farmer is also busy and often can not spare the time to remove  manure regularly. The general practice, therefore, has been to keep the  manure in heaps located, as a rule, very near the stables. How can fly  breeding be prevented in such accumulations? As a result of recent  investigations, it is now possible to point out two methods which are  practical and effective.    The first is the treatment of the manure pile with chemical substances  which will kill the eggs and maggots of the house fly. The Bureau of  Entomology, in cooperation with the Bureau of Chemistry and the Bureau  of Plant Industry, has conducted a series of experiments in which a  large number of chemicals were applied to infested manure and  observations made, not only on their efficiency in killing the maggots  but also as to their effect on the chemical composition and bacterial  flora of the manure. The object was to find some cheap chemical which  would be effective in destroying the fly larvae and at the same time  would not reduce the fertilizing value of the manure.      TREATMENT WITH HELLEBORE.    Of the numerous substances tried, the one which seems best to fulfill  these conditions is powdered hellebore.[10] For the treatment of manure a  water extract of the hellebore is prepared by adding 1/2 pound of the  powder to every 10 gallons of water, and after stirring it is allowed to  stand 24 hours. The mixture thus prepared is sprinkled over the manure  at the rate of 10 gallons to every 8 bushels (10 cubic feet) of manure.  From the result of 12 experiments with manure piles treated under  natural conditions it appears that such treatment results in the  destruction of from 88 to 99 per cent of the fly larvae.    Studies of treated manure indicated that its composition and rotting  were not interfered with. Furthermore, several field tests showed that  there was no apparent injury to growing crops when fertilized with  treated manure.    Since the solution is somewhat poisonous it should not be left exposed  where it might be drunk by livestock. It is quite safe to say that  chickens will not be injured by pecking at hellebore-treated manure.  This has been tested carefully. Hellebore can be obtained both in ground  and powdered form, but the powder gives the best results in the  destruction of fly larvae.    [Footnote 10: _Veratrum viride_ or _V. aloum_.]      TREATMENT WITH POWDERED BORAX.    Another chemical found to be even more effective as a larvicide is  powdered borax. This substance is available in commercial form in all  parts of the country. It has the advantage of being comparatively  nonpoisonous and noninflammable and is easily transported and handled.  The minimum amount necessary to kill fly larvae was found to be 0.62  pound per 8 bushels of manure, or about 1 pound per 16 cubic feet. Best  results were obtained when the borax was applied in solution, or when  water was sprinkled on after the borax had been scattered evenly over  the pile. Borax is not only effective in killing the larvae, but when it  comes in contact with the eggs it prevents them from hatching. When  applied at the rate of 1 pound to 16 cubic feet it was found to kill  about 90 per cent of the larvae, heavier applications killing from 98 to  99 per cent.    Borax has no injurious effect on the chemical composition or rotting of  the manure. However, when added in large quantities with manure to the  soil it will cause considerable injury to growing plants. A number of  experiments have been conducted to determine the effect on crops of the  use of manure treated with borax as herein recommended. When applied at  the rate of 15 tons per acre it appears that no injury as a rule will  follow. Some crops are more sensitive to borax than others, and also the  tendency to injury appears to vary on different soils. It is necessary,  therefore, to repeat the warning issued in connection with a previous  bulletin[11] on this subject, that great care be exercised, in the  application of borax, that the manure does not receive more than 1 pound  for every 16 cubic feet, and that not more than 15 tons of manure so  treated are applied to the acre.    In view of the possible injury from the borax treatment as a result of  carelessness in applying it, or from other unforeseen conditions, it is  recommended that horse manure and other farmyard manures which are to be  used as fertilizer be treated with hellebore. Borax, on the other hand,  is such a good larvicide that it call be used with advantage on the  ground of soil-floor stables, in privies, on refuse piles, and on any  accumulations of fermenting organic matter which are not to be used for  fertilizing purposes.    [Footnote 11: Department Bulletin 118, U. S. Department of Agriculture,  p. 25.]      TREATMENT WITH CALCIUM CYANAMID AND ACID PHOSPHATE.    Many experiments with mixtures of commercial fertilizers were tried to  determine whether fly larvae would be killed by any substance the  addition of which would increase the fertilizing value of the manure. A  mixture of calcium cyanamid and acid phosphate was found to possess  considerable larvicidal action. Several experiments showed that 1/2  pound of calcium cyanamid plus 1/2 pound of acid phosphate to each  bushel of manure give an apparent larvicidal action of 98 per cent. The  mixture in the form of a powder was scattered evenly over the surface  and then wet down with water. The use of this mixture adds to the manure  two important elements, nitrogen and phosphorus.      MAGGOT TRAP FOR DESTRUCTION OF FLY LARVAE FROM HORSE MANURE.    The second method of handling manure is one which does not require the  application of chemicals. It is based on the fact, mentioned on page 4,  that the larvae of the house fly, a few hours before they are ready to  pupate, show a strong tendency to migrate. This migration takes place  mostly at night, and the larvae sometimes crawl considerable distances  from the manure pile. Now it is possible by means of a very simple  arrangement called a maggot trap to destroy fully 99 per cent of all  maggots breeding in a given lot of manure. A successful maggot trap  which the Maryland Agricultural College constructed at the college barn  is shown in Figure 9. The trap was designed by R. H. Hutchison and  constructed under his supervision. The manure, instead of being thrown  on the ground, is heaped carefully on a slatted platform, which stands  about 1 foot high. This particular platform measures 10 by 20 feet.  There are six 2 by 4 pieces running lengthwise 2 feet apart. Across  these are nailed 1-inch strips with 1/2 to 1 inch spaces between them.  The wooden platform stands on a concrete floor, and a rim or wall of  concrete 4 inches high surrounds the floor. The floor slopes a little  toward one corner from which a pipe leads to a small cistern near by.  This pipe is plugged with a stopper of soft wood, and the concrete floor  is filled with water to a depth of 1 inch in the shallowest part. Flies  will lay their eggs on the manure as usual, but the maggots, when they  have finished feeding and begin to migrate, crawl out of the manure,  drop into the water below, and are drowned. Each week the plug is  removed from the pipe, and all the maggots are washed into the cistern.  The floor is then cleaned of any solid particles by means of a  long-handled stable broom or by a strong stream of water from a hose.  The pipe being again plugged, the floor is again partly filled with  water and the trap is ready for another week's catch. A platform of this  size will hold the manure accumulating from four horses during the  period of four months, or about 20 days' accumulation from 25 horses, if  the heap is well built and made at least 5 feet high.    [Illustration: FIG. 9. A maggot trap for house-fly control. View showing  the concrete basin containing water in which larvae are drowned, and the  wooden platform on which manure is heaped. (Hutchison.)]    Experience with this maggot trap clearly indicates that best results can  be secured if the manure is compactly heaped on the platform and kept  thoroughly moistened. It is best to apply a small amount of water each  morning after the stable cleanings have been added to the pile. It  should be borne in mind that in order to make this trap a success the  platform beneath the pile must be kept comparatively free of  accumulations of manure, and moisture applied regularly to drive the  maggots out.      COMPACT HEAPING OF MANURE.    Another method of disposing of manure has been recommended by English  writers. The manure is built up in a compact rectangular heap, the sides  of which are beaten hard with shovels. The ground around the edges of  the heap is made smooth and hard and loose straw is placed in small  windrows around the manure pile about 1 foot from the edge.

Now whether these persons were in reality exiles by choice, for the  sake of keeping out of the way of creditors, or of enjoying the  society of those they preferred to their own domestic circle, I do not  venture to conjecture. But let the reader consider whether _any_  conjecture can be _more_ improbable than the statement actually made.    It is, indeed, credible that ambition may prompt an unscrupulous man  to make the most enormous sacrifices of human life, and to perpetrate  the most atrocious crimes, for the advancement of his views of  conquest. But that this _great_ man--as he is usually reckoned even by  adversaries--this hero according to some--this illustrious warrior,  and mighty sovereign--should have stooped to be guilty of an act of  mean and petty malice worthy of a spiteful old woman,--a piece of  paltry cruelty which could not at all conduce to his success in the  war, or produce any effect except to degrade his country, and  exasperate ours;--this, surely, is quite incredible. \"Pizarro,\" says  Elvira in Kotzebue's play, \"if not always justly, at least act always  greatly.\"    But a still more wonderful circumstance connected with this  transaction remains behind. A large portion of the English nation, and  among these the whole of the Whig party, are said to have expressed  the most vehement indignation, mingled with compassion, at the  banishment from Europe, and confinement in St. Helena, of this great  man. No considerations of regard for the peace and security of our own  country, no dread of the power of so able and indefatigable a warrior,  and so inveterate an enemy, should have induced us, they thought, to  subject this formidable personage to a confinement, which was far  less severe than that to which he was said to have subjected such  numbers of our countrymen, the harmless _non-belligerent_ travellers,  whom (according to the story) he kidnapped in France, with no object  but to gratify the basest and most unmanly spite.    But that there is no truth in that story, and that it was not believed  by those who manifested so much sympathy and indignation on this great  man's account, is sufficiently proved by that very sympathy and  indignation.    There are again other striking improbabilities connected with the  Polish nation in the history before us. Buonaparte is represented as  having always expressed the strongest sympathy with that ill-used  people; and they, as being devotedly attached to him, and fighting  with the utmost fidelity and bravery in his armies, in which some of  them attained high commands. Now he had it manifestly in his power at  one period (according to the received accounts), with a stroke of his  pen, to re-establish Poland as an independent state. For, in his last  Russian war, he had complete occupation of the country (of which the  population was perfectly friendly); the Russian portion of it was his  by right of conquest; and Austria and Prussia, then his allies, and  almost his subjects, would gladly have resigned their portions in  exchange for some of the provinces they had ceded to France, and  which were, to him, of little value, but, to them, important. And,  indeed, Prussia was (as we are told) so thoroughly humbled and  weakened that he might easily have enforced the cession of  Prussian-Poland, even without any compensation. And the  re-establishment of the Polish kingdom would have been as evidently  politic as it was reasonable. The independence of a faithful and  devoted ally, at enmity with the surrounding nations--the very nations  that were the most likely to combine (as they often had done) against  him,--this would have given him, at no cost, a kind of strong garrison  to maintain his power, and keep his enemies in check.    Yet this most obvious step, the history tells us, he did not take; but  made flattering speeches to the Poles, used their services, and did  nothing for them!    This is, alone, sufficiently improbable. But we are required moreover  to believe that the Poles,--instead of _execrating_ this man, who had  done them the unpardonable wrong of wantonly disappointing the  expectations he had, for his own purposes, excited, thus adding  treachery to ingratitude--instead of this, continued to the last as  much devoted to him as ever, and even now idolize his memory! We are  to believe, in short, that this Buonaparte, not only in his own  conduct and adventures violated all the established rules of  probability, but also caused all other persons, as many as came in  contact with him, to act as no mortals ever did act before: may we not  add, as no mortals ever did act at all?    Many other improbabilities might be added to the list, and will be  found in the complete edition of that history, from which some  extracts will be presently given, and which has been published (under  the title of \"Historic Certainties\") by Aristarchus Newlight, with a  learned commentary (not, indeed, adopting the views contained in these  pages, but) quite equal in ingenuity to a late work on the \"Hebrew  Monarchy.\"    After all, it may be expected that many who perceive the force of  these objections, will yet be loth to think it possible that they and  the public at large can have been so long and so greatly imposed upon.  And thus it is that the magnitude and boldness of a fraud becomes its  best support. The millions who for so many ages have believed in  Mahomet or Brahma, lean as it were on each other for support; and not  having vigour of mind enough boldly to throw off vulgar prejudices,  and dare be wiser than the multitude, persuade themselves that what so  many have acknowledged must be true. But I call on those who boast  their philosophical freedom of thought, and would fain tread in the  steps of Hume and other inquirers of the like exalted and speculative  genius, to follow up fairly and fully their own principles, and,  throwing off the shackles of authority, to examine carefully the  evidence of whatever is proposed to them, before they admit its truth.    That even in this enlightened age, as it is called, a whole nation may  be egregiously imposed upon, even in matters which intimately concern  them, may be proved (if it has not been already proved) by the  following instance: it was stated in the newspapers, that, a month  after the battle of Trafalgar, an English officer, who had been a  prisoner of war, and was exchanged, returned to this country from  France, and beginning to condole with his countrymen on the terrible  _defeat_ they had sustained, was infinitely astonished to learn that  the battle of Trafalgar was a splendid victory. He had been assured,  he said, that in that battle the English had been totally defeated;  and the French were fully and universally persuaded that such was the  fact. Now if this report of the belief of the French nation was _not_  true, the British Public were completely imposed upon; if it _were_  true, then both nations were, at the same time, rejoicing in the event  of the same battle, as a signal victory to themselves; and  consequently one or other, at least, of these nations must have been  the dupes of their government: for if the battle was never fought at  all, or was not decisive on either side, in that case _both_ parties  were deceived. This instance, I conceive, is absolutely demonstrative  of the point in question.    \"But what shall we say to the testimony of those many respectable  persons who went to Plymouth on purpose, and saw Buonaparte with their  own eyes? must they not trust their senses?\" I would not disparage  either the eyesight or the veracity of these gentlemen. I am ready to  allow that they went to Plymouth for the purpose of seeing Buonaparte;  nay, more, that they actually rowed out into the harbour in a boat,  and came alongside of a man-of-war, on whose deck they saw a man in a  cocked hat, who, _they were told_, was Buonaparte. This is the utmost  point to which their testimony goes; how they ascertained that this  man in the cocked hat had gone through all the marvellous and romantic  adventures with which we have so long been amused, we are not told.  Did they perceive in his physiognomy, his true name, and authentic  history? Truly this evidence is such as country people give one for a  story of apparitions; if you discover any signs of incredulity, they  triumphantly show the very house which the ghost haunted, the  identical dark corner where it used to vanish, and perhaps even the  tombstone of the person whose death it foretold. Jack Cade's nobility  was supported by the same irresistible kind of evidence: having  asserted that the eldest son of Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was  stolen by a beggar-woman, \"became a bricklayer when he came to age,\"  and was the father of the supposed Jack Cade; one of his companions  confirms the story, by saying, \"Sir, he made a chimney in my father's  house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it; therefore,  deny it not.\"    Much of the same kind is the testimony of our brave countrymen, who  are ready to produce the scars they received in fighting against this  terrible Buonaparte. That they fought and were wounded, they may  safely testify; and probably they no less firmly _believe_ what they  were _told_ respecting the cause in which they fought: it would have  been a high breach of discipline to doubt it; and they, I conceive,  are men better skilled in handling a musket, than in sifting evidence,  and detecting imposture. But I defy any one of them to come forward  and declare, _on his own knowledge_, what was the cause in which he  fought,--under whose commands the opposed"]]]
