One day when the two princes were hunting, and the princess had remained  at home, a religious old woman came to the gate, and desired leave to go  in to say her prayers, it being then the hour. The servants asked the  princess's permission, who ordered them to show her into the oratory,  which the intendant of the emperor's gardens had taken care to fit up in  his house, for want of a mosque in the neighbourhood. She bade them,  also, after the good woman had finished her prayers, to show her the  house and gardens and then bring her to the hall.    The old woman went into the oratory, said her prayers, and when she came  out two of the princess's women invited her to see the residence, which  civility she accepted, followed them from one apartment to another, and  observed, like a person who understood what belonged to furniture, the  nice arrangement of everything. They conducted her also into the garden,  the disposition of which she found so well planned, that she admired it,  observing that the person who had formed it must have been an excellent  master of his art. Afterward she was brought before the princess, who  waited for her in the great hall, which in beauty and richness exceeded  all that she had admired in the other apartments.    As soon as the princess saw the devout woman, she said to her: \"My good  mother, come near and sit down by me. I am overjoyed at the happiness of  having the opportunity of profiting for some moments by the example and  conversation of such a person as you, who have taken the right way by  dedicating yourself to the service of God. I wish every one were as  wise.\"    The devout woman, instead of sitting on a sofa, would only sit upon the  edge of one. The princess would not permit her to do so, but rising from  her seat and taking her by the hand, obliged her to come and sit by her.  The good woman, sensible of the civility, said: \"Madam, I ought not to  have so much respect shown me; but since you command, and are mistress  of your own house, I will obey you.\" When she had seated herself, before  they entered into any conversation, one of the princess's women brought  a low stand of mother-of-pearl and ebony, with a china dish full of  cakes upon it, and many others set round it full of fruits in season,  and wet and dry sweetmeats.    The princess took up one of the cakes, and presenting her with it, said:  \"Eat, good mother, and make choice of what you like best; you had need  to eat after coming so far.\" \"Madam,\" replied the good woman, \"I am not  used to eat such delicacies, but will not refuse what God has sent me by  so liberal a hand as yours.\"    While the devout woman was eating, the princess ate a little too, to  bear her company, and asked her many questions upon the exercise of  devotion which she practised and how she lived; all of which she  answered with great modesty. Talking of various things, at last the  princess asked her what she thought of the house, and how she liked it.    \"Madam,\" answered the devout woman, \"I must certainly have very bad  taste to disapprove anything in it, since it is beautiful, regular, and  magnificently furnished with exactness and judgment, and all its  ornaments adjusted in the best manner. Its situation is an agreeable  spot, and no garden can be more delightful; but yet, if you will give me  leave to speak my mind freely, I will take the liberty to tell you that  this house would be incomparable if it had three things which are  wanting to complete it.\" \"My good mother,\" replied the Princess  Periezade, \"what are those? I entreat you to tell me what they are; I  will spare nothing to get them.\"    \"Madam,\" replied the devout woman, \"the first of these three things is  the Talking Bird, so singular a creature, that it draws round it all the  songsters of the neighbourhood which come to accompany its voice. The  second is the Singing Tree, the leaves of which are so many mouths which  form an harmonious concert of different voices and never cease. The  third is the Golden Water, a single drop of which being poured into a  vessel properly prepared, it increases so as to fill it immediately, and  rises up in the middle like a fountain, which continually plays, and yet  the basin never overflows.\"    \"Ah! my good mother,\" cried the princess, \"how much am I obliged to you  for the knowledge of these curiosities! I never before heard there were  such rarities in the world; but as I am persuaded that you know, I  expect that you should do me the favour to inform me where they are to  be found.\"    \"Madam,\" replied the good woman, \"I should be unworthy the hospitality  you have shown me if I should refuse to satisfy your curiosity on that  point, and am glad to have the honour to tell you that these curiosities  are all to be met with in the same spot on the confines of this kingdom,  toward India. The road lies before your house, and whoever you send  needs but follow it for twenty days, and on the twentieth only let him  ask the first person he meets where the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree,  and the Golden Water are, and he will be informed.\" After saying this,  she rose from her seat, took her leave, and went her way.    The Princess Periezade's thoughts were so taken up with the Talking  Bird, Singing Tree, and Golden Water, that she never perceived the  devout woman's departure, till she wanted to ask her some question for  her better information; for she thought that what she had been told was  not a sufficient reason for exposing herself by undertaking a long  journey. However, she would not send after her visitor, but endeavoured  to remember all the directions, and when she thought she had recollected  every word, took real pleasure in thinking of the satisfaction she  should have if she could get these curiosities into her possession; but  the difficulties she apprehended and the fear of not succeeding made her  very uneasy.    She was absorbed in these thoughts when her brothers returned from  hunting, who, when they entered the great hall, instead of finding her  lively and gay, as she was wont to be, were amazed to see her so pensive  and hanging down her head as if something troubled her.    \"Sister,\" said Prince Bahman, \"what is become of all your mirth and  gaiety? Are you not well? or has some misfortune befallen you? Tell us,  that we may know how to act, and give you some relief. If any one has  affronted you, we will resent his insolence.\"    The princess remained in the same posture some time without answering,  but at last lifted up her eyes to look at her brothers, and then held  them down again, telling them nothing disturbed her.    \"Sister,\" said Prince Bahman, \"you conceal the truth from us; there must  be something of consequence. It is impossible we could observe so sudden  a change if nothing was the matter with you. You would not have us  satisfied with the evasive answer you have given; do not conceal  anything, unless you would have us suspect that you renounce the strict  union which has hitherto subsisted between us.\"    The princess, who had not the smallest intention to offend her brothers,  would not suffer them to entertain such a thought, but said: \"When I  told you nothing disturbed me, I meant nothing that was of importance to  you, but to me it is of some consequence; and since you press me to tell  you by our strict union and friendship, which are so dear to me, I will.  You think, and I always believed so too, that this house was so complete  that nothing was wanting. But this day I have learned that it lacks  three rarities which would render it so perfect that no country seat in  the world could be compared with it. These three things are the Talking  Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water.\" After she had informed  them wherein consisted the excellency of these rarities, \"A devout  woman,\" added she, \"has made this discovery to me, told me the place  where they are to be found, and the way thither. Perhaps you may imagine  these things of little consequence; that without these additions our  house will always be thought sufficiently elegant, and that we can do  without them. You may think as you please, but I cannot help telling you  that I am persuaded they are absolutely necessary, and I shall not be  easy without them. Therefore, whether you value them or not, I desire  you to consider what person you may think proper for me to send in  search of the curiosities I have mentioned.\"    \"Sister,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"nothing can concern you in which we  have not an equal interest. It is enough that you desire these things to  oblige us to take the same interest; but if you had not, we feel  ourselves inclined of our own accord and for our own individual  satisfaction. I am persuaded my brother is of the same opinion, and  therefore we ought to undertake this conquest, for the importance and  singularity of the undertaking deserve that name. I will take the charge  upon myself; only tell me the place and the way to it, and I will defer  my journey no longer than till to-morrow.\"    \"Brother,\" said Prince Perviz, \"it is not proper that you, who are the  head of our family, should be absent. I desire my sister should join  with me to oblige you to abandon your design, and allow me to undertake  it. I hope to acquit myself as well as you, and it will be a more  regular proceeding.\" \"I am persuaded of your goodwill, brother,\" replied  Prince Bahman, \"and that you would succeed as well as myself in this  journey; but I have resolved and will undertake it. You shall stay at  home with our sister, and I need not recommend her to you.\"    The next morning Bahman mounted his horse, and Perviz and the princess  embraced and wished him a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20924"],[0,"Ely Cathedral (#4)"],[1," on the  eastern side was defrayed by a sum of money left by Bishop Hotham.    [Footnote 8: Ibid.]    [Footnote 9: Ibid.]    The spire erected on the western Tower by Bishop Northwold was taken  down in the latter part of the fourteenth century, and was replaced by  an octagonal story, flanked with turrets, in the Decorated style,  above which a spire was again placed. This was an injudicious step,  and has been thought to have been the primary cause of the ruin of the  north-western Transept, the great additional weight being more than  the four supporting arches (which were lofty) were intended to bear.  Of the period when the Transept fell, or was taken down, we have no  record; but the character of the buttress on the site of the western  wall shows that it must have been at an early period, probably about  A.D. 1400, as the strengthening arches placed within the original ones  appear to have been erected a few years after.    We have no further additions to the fabric to particularise in this  sketch, with the exception of the chapel of Bishop Alcock,  (1486-1500), in the Perpendicular style; and that of Bishop West  (1515-1533), in the same style, but when it was approaching to  Renaissance; but the alterations of windows and other parts, together  with necessary repairs, have been numerous and various at different  periods.    The Choir was under the Octagon until 1770, when it was removed to the  east end of the church; it was again altered in 1852 to its present  position. Many costly and extensive restorations[10] and alterations  have been made within the last thirty-five years, and others are still  in progress. The Galilee, or western porch, has been cleansed and  floored, and the arch of communication with the Tower beautifully  restored; the western Tower has been strengthened, the interior thrown  more open, a painted ceiling put up, and a new floor laid; the  south-west Transept has been opened, repaired, ceiled, paved and  cleansed; the apsidal Chapel of St. Catherine has been rebuilt and  paved; the roof of the Nave has been re-covered with lead, the  interior walls have been cleansed, a new and beautiful painted ceiling  completed, and a new floor laid in the Nave and aisles; the Octagon  and Lantern have undergone a thorough repair, and the decoration of  the dome and lantern has been effected; the great Transept has been  repaired, the polychrome roof re-painted, and a new floor laid in the  northern portion. The whole of the eastern portion of the church has  been cleansed and restored; the beautiful Purbeck marble pillars have  been re-polished; the floor of the Choir has been re-laid with veined  and black marble combined with encaustic tiles; an enriched oaken  screen has been erected at the entrance of the Choir, near which a new  and elegant stone pulpit has been placed; the original stalls have  been repaired, and improved by the introduction of a series of carved  panels, and new sub-stalls erected; and a new and elaborate reredos or  altar screen has been placed in the Choir. More than eighty windows,  exclusive of the eight lights at the east end of the church, have been  filled with stained glass by various artists, and several others,  which had for many years been stopped up, have been re-opened; the  organ has been very considerably enlarged and improved, put into a new  and elegant case, and placed in another position; and several stoves  have been introduced for warming the Cathedral when necessary. The  whole has been done at considerable expense, to meet which the funds  have been raised by subscriptions, towards which the late Bishops  Sparke, Allen, Turton, and Browne, the late Deans Peacock and Goodwin,  the Canons and their families and connections, with many noblemen,  gentlemen, and others, have been contributors: the capitular body have  done much towards the work in general, but particularly towards the  repairs of the fabric, the enlargement of the organ, and the warming  of the Cathedral. For a more detailed account of works and expenses we  refer our readers to Appendix II. at the end of the work.    [Footnote 10: The Restorations, which have been for some years in  progress, have been executed throughout with the most scrupulous care,  preserving every portion of uninjured surface, and re-producing what  is mutilated or destroyed as nearly as possible in exact conformity  with the indications of the ancient work afforded by the parts which  remain, and in the same material. They were at first carried out under  the directions of the late Dean Peacock, assisted from time to time by  Professor Willis, and by the occasional advice of Professional  friends: but towards the end of the year 1847, Sir G.G. Scott was  appointed architect to the works, and under his direction the  rearrangement of the Choir was effected, and other restorations in  progress carried out until his death. The windows have been filled  with stained glass chiefly through the munificence and exertions of  the late Canon E.B. Sparke.]           *       *       *       *       *    St. Etheldreda's church was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin; the  church erected by Ethelwold to St. Peter and St. Etheldreda; but since  the Reformation the dedication of the Cathedral has been to \"The Holy  and Undivided Trinity.\"           *       *       *       *       *    HISTORICAL SUMMARY.

The conventional [Transcriber's Note: so in original, probably        should be \"conventual\"] buildings sold and destroyed, portions only        reserved for residence of Dean and Canons and other officers. The        Guest Chamber used as the common Hall of the College, but converted        at a later period into the Deanery.    1642  Dean Fuller deprived by the Parliament. During the Rebellion Ely        occupied by Cromwell's soldiers, and the Cathedral said to have        been used for stabling their horses.    1649  Commissioners under the Commonwealth survey and cause further        destruction of the conventual buildings.    1676  Pavement of the Nave restored by Mr. Clopton.    1699  Fall of the north-west angle of the north-eastern Transept;        rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren.    1754  Extensive repairs of the roof of the Octagon and Choir by Bishop        Mawson, and Deans Allix and Thomas.    1770  The stalls transferred from the Octagon to the Presbytery by Essex,        architect, and important repairs of the fabric executed.    1771  Publication of Bentham's \"History and Antiquities of Ely Cathedral\"    1801  The upper parts of the Tower repaired.    1823  The Nave, Octagon, Lantern, and Transepts coloured, and the Stalls        painted.
