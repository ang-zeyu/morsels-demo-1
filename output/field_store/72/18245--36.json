The scream was followed by exclamations from two  men, and then a wild thumping as if someone was hitting the floor with  a cane.    \"It's a mouse--several of 'em!\" came in the voice of Grandfather Rover.    \"Oh, my! oh, my! wherever did they come from?\" exclaimed old Aunt  Martha.    \"Never mind where they came from, I'll fix 'em,\" asserted old Randolph  Rover, and then followed another thumping as he rushed around between  the chairs and behind the sofa, trying to slaughter some of the  scampering mice with his heavy walking stick.    \"Where are they? Where are those mice?\" demanded Tom Rover, giving a  hasty glance around the kitchen.    \"There is one--under the sink!\" ejaculated his brother Sam, and  catching up a stove lifter he let fly with such accurate aim that the  unhappy rodent was despatched on the spot.    \"I see another one back of the pantry door,\" said Tom Rover a moment  later, and then made a dive into the pantry. Here, in a side closet,  the door of which was partly open, he saw a broom and grabbed it  quickly. Then he made a wild pass at the mouse, but the rodent eluded  him and scrambled over the kitchen floor and into the sitting-room.    \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Did you ever see so many mice?\" came in a wailing  voice from Aunt Martha. She had clambered up on a chair and stood there  holding her dress tightly around her feet.    \"It's another of those boys' tricks, that's what it is,\" asserted  Grandfather Rover. \"They ought to be punished for it.\"    \"Yes. But we've got to get rid of these mice first,\" answered his  brother.    Then Randolph Rover, seeing a mouse scampering across the side of the  room, threw his walking stick at it with all his force. But his aim was  poor and the walking stick, striking the edge of the table, glanced off  and hit a fish-globe, smashing it to pieces and sending the water and  the goldfish flying in every direction.          CHAPTER III    WHAT FOLLOWED ANOTHER TRICK      When the hubbub downstairs started the four Rover boys were up in their  adjoining bedrooms partly undressed and in the midst of a couple of  impromptu boxing matches, one taking place between Andy and Jack and  the other between Randy and Fred.    \"There, my boy, how do you like that?\" cried Andy, as, dancing around,  he managed to land a slapping blow on Jack's bare shoulder.    \"Fine, child! fine!\" retorted young Jack. \"But not half as good as  this,\" he continued, and, with a sudden spring, he landed one blow on  Andy's chest and another on his shoulder which sent Tom's son  staggering half-way across the bed.    \"Hurrah! one man down! Now for the next!\" cried Fred, and managed to  land several blows in quick succession on Randy's shoulder.    But then the fun-loving twin came at him with a rush, sending him into  a corner and on to a little table containing a number of books. As Fred  went down the table did likewise and the books fell all over him.    \"Whoop!\" roared Randy in his delight. \"Down and buried!\"    \"But not dead,\" retorted Fred, promptly, and catching up several of the  books he hurled them in quick succession at his opponent. One in  particular caught Randy in the stomach, and down he sat with a  suddenness that jarred the floor.    \"Say!\" exclaimed Jack, suddenly, and held up his hand, \"this won't do  at all. The folks downstairs will think we're pulling the house down  over their ears. We'll have to slow up a bit. You know what our fathers  said a little while ago.\"    \"All right,\" returned Andy, promptly, as he arose to his feet. \"After  this we'll be as quiet as a thunder storm in a moving picture drama.\"    \"That's the talk! Silence it is!\" cried his twin; and then to let off a  little extra steam he silently turned a cart-wheel across the floor,  after which he proceeded with his toilet making.    The boys were still minus their collars and ties when they suddenly  realized that something unusual was taking place downstairs. They had  closed the bedroom doors, but now all of them rushed out into the  hallway.    \"Great watermelons!\" groaned Randy, and turned slightly pale. \"I forgot  all about 'em!\"    \"About what?\" chimed in Jack.    \"You don't mean the mice?\" demanded Andy.    \"Yes, I do!\"    \"What mice?\" questioned Fred.    \"The mice I caught under the flooring of the old wagon house  yesterday,\" answered Randy.    \"I thought you put them in a cage and drowned them in the brook.\"    \"I was going to do that, but then I changed my mind and put 'em in a  couple of boxes. I thought maybe I might have a chance to train  'em--just like those mice we once saw in a show.\"    \"Where did you put those boxes?\" demanded Andy, quickly.    \"I--I--didn't know exactly what to do with 'em, so--I--I--put 'em on  the shelf in the pantry downstairs,\" faltered the twin.    \"Great catfish, Randy! you've got us into a fine mess!\" broke in Fred.    \"Coming right on top of that trouble with the water-hose!\" added Jack,  ruefully.    After that there was a moment of silence, the four cousins gazing at  each other uncertainly. Then Randy drew a long breath.    \"Well, I'm going downstairs to see what's doing,\" he declared. \"If I've  got to suffer for this, I might as well see the fun.\"    \"I'm going down, too,\" responded his twin, and side by side they ran  down the stairs, with Jack and Fred close at their heels.    Perhaps it was poetic justice that Randy, who had been the cause of  this commotion, should suffer the worst for it. Hardly had he put his  foot in the lower hallway of the farmhouse when a mouse, scampering  from a nearby doorway, made directly for him. The boy made a wild jump  to step on the rodent, missed his footing, and came down flat on his  back. He landed directly at the foot of the stairs, and his brother,  being unable to stop, fell on top of him.    \"Hi! Get off of me!\" gasped the unfortunate youth. \"What do you want to  do--crack my head open?\"    \"Next time you go down, give a fellow warning,\" retorted his brother,  scrambling to his feet; and then the two boys, with Jack and Fred,  entered the sitting-room, doing this just as their fathers came in from  the direction of the kitchen and just when old Uncle Randolph made his  unfortunate attack on the fish-globe.    \"Hello! look at the fish on the floor,\" exclaimed Jack. \"What's the  matter, Grandfather? Did the mice upset the globe?\"    \"No. I did that, trying to hit one of the pesky creatures,\" explained  old Uncle Randolph. \"We must kill them some way or they'll get all over  the house, and then none of us will have any peace.\"    \"I wouldn't care for a piece of mouse, anyway,\" remarked Andy, but in  such a low tone that none of the older folks heard him.    \"Everybody get a stick and go at those mice,\" commanded Dick Rover, and  looked at the boys so sternly they all began to feel uncomfortable.  \"We've got either to kill them or drive them out of the house,  otherwise the lady folks won't be able to sleep to-night.\"    \"I'll get a poker and kill as many of 'em as I can,\" cried Randy, and  ran out into the kitchen to do as he had mentioned.    The other boys, as well as their fathers, armed themselves with canes,  umbrellas, and brooms, and for the next fifteen minutes there was a  rapid and thorough search for all of the rodents. Several were driven  outside through the open doors, while others were caught and  slaughtered in various parts of the kitchen, the pantry, and the rooms  adjoining. Then the goldfish were gathered up and put into another bowl  of water and the bits of broken glass were removed.    \"I'm awfully sorry, Uncle Randy, you broke the fish-globe,\" said Randy,  contritely, \"but I'm glad you saved the fish.\"    \"Look here, young man, I want to talk to you--and to you, too!\" cried  Tom, sharply, and without more ado caught each twin by the arm and  marched them into the library.    \"Wow! I'm afraid Andy and Randy are in for it now,\" whispered Fred to  Jack.    \"Well, Randy certainly had no right to put those mice in the pantry,\"  answered his cousin. \"Just the same, I hope Uncle Tom isn't too severe  with 'em.\"    \"I don't see why Andy should be punished for this.\"    \"Oh, they always stick together. You know that as well as I do.\"    \"So I do. Isn't it wonderful how each is willing to share the blame  with the other?\" added Fred, with deep admiration.    Once in the library, Tom Rover shut the doors tightly and then faced  his twin sons.    \"Now then, I want the truth about this,\" he commenced sternly. \"Where  did those mice come from?\"    \"They came from under the flooring of the old wagon house,\" answered  Randy. \"I caught them there when the carpenters tore up the floor to  put down the new one.\"    \"And where did you put them?\"    \"I put 'em in a--er--a couple of boxes.\"    \"Randy was going to keep the mice and try to teach 'em to do tricks,  just the same as those mice we once saw in a vaudeville show,\" put in  Andy, quickly, to do what he could to shield his brother.    \"More tricks, eh?\" was Tom's dry comment. \"It seems to me that it is  nothing but tricks lately. I suppose you placed the boxes in the pantry  just so the mice wouldn't catch cold, didn't you?\" he went on  quizzically.    \"No, sir. I--I--placed 'em there just for safekeeping,\" was the  hesitating answer. \"I didn't know that Lulu would disturb them.\"    \"That's it, Dad. I'm sure Randy didn't want 'em disturbed.\"    \"And what did you have to do with this, Andy?\" demanded the father.    At this the boy addressed had nothing to say.    \"He had nothing to do with it, Dad,\" answered Randy. \"I got the mice  and put 'em in the two boxes. I s'pose it wasn't just the right thing  to put 'em in the pantry, but I give you my word I didn't think they'd  be upset the way they were and be sent running all over the house. If  Lulu hadn't touched the boxes, the mice would be there yet.\"    \"Perhaps,\" answered Tom Rover, dryly. \"Just the same, I think you  placed the boxes there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#4)"],[1," wild melon made it possible to traverse the  waterless wastes of the \"Great Thirst Land.\"    I did not hesitate a moment, in fact no wink of sleep had I that night,  but lay tossing and turning, longing for daylight to come that I might  inspan and commence my long trek.    It came at last, my preparations for striking camp were soon made, and  sending off my crowd of Bushmen camp-followers with a small present of  tobacco, I turned my back to the sea and began my long journey to the  north-east.    Out of the long defiles and valleys we threaded our way into the open  country, past the huge flat-topped mountains of Ombokoro, the fastness  of the Berg Damaras, thence following the dry river-bed of the Om-  Mafako north-east to the confines of the Omaheke desert that great  north-western outlier of the true Kalahari not far, indeed, from this  very spot! So far the trek had been slow and tedious, but without  untoward incident. We were well armed, and those natives who did not  avoid us were only too eager to bring in food, or show us water in  return for our trade goods.    But, as the broken, bushy country gave way to the sand, water became  scarcer and scarcer, until it could only be obtained in small  quantities by digging deep in the bone-dry bed of the parched-up river.    At length it became evident that we could take the wagon and oxen no  farther; and so, at some Bushmen water-pits, at the every edge of the  desert, where \"toa\" grass and other fodder was still plentiful, I  decided to leave both vehicle and beasts in charge of my Hottentot and  Griqua followers, and attempt the desert journey on horseback, and  accompanied only by Inyati. Indeed there was no other course; for the  few \"pans\" that might contain water on the route we should have to  follow, were far between, and, as the season was late, even they might  well be dry. \"T'samma,\" therefore, the wild melon that serves for food  and water for both man and beast in these desert stretches, would be  our only resource; but even in this respect the lateness of the season  was a source of anxiety, for, as you doubtless know, when once it is  over-ripe the t'samma is useless.    Two riding and two pack horses were all therefore that we dare take; on  the latter we loaded food, ammunition, spare arms and trade goods; and  with our skin water-bags filled, one evening when the moon was nearly  at its full, we bade goodbye to our little band, and struck due east  across the desert.    Our plan was to hold in that direction as long as t'samma was abundant;  and should it fail, to attempt to reach one of the \"pans\" Inyati had  discovered in his flight across the desert years before, and which the  strange instinct of locality common to all natives of these wastes  would probably enable him to find again.    All night long we rode slowly and steadily through the dunes which were  here favorable to our course; for their long parallel lines ran like  the waves of the sea, almost due east and west, as far as the eye could  reach, and we were able to ride in the \"aars\" or narrow valleys between  them and make good progress.    So far vegetation of a sort was still abundant, tufted \"toa\" grass,  sorrel, and other succulent plants offered juicy fodder for the horses,  and I began to think that this much-dreaded desert was a desert but in  name, and that our task was to be a light one. With dawn we off-  saddled. From the summit of a high dune I looked round in all  directions, and as far as the eye could reach could see nothing but the  endless monotony of wave after wave of dunes, treeless, and apparently  almost devoid of vegetation, for the little there was, was confined to  the deep hollows between. A short distance away a fair-sized bush  offered a modicum of shade, and here we rested for the day for we had  planned to travel only in the cool of the night as long as the moon  served. And here Inyati showed me how to make water from the young  green t'samma, taking those the size of an orange only, and roasting  them in the ashes, and thus turning their pulp into a clear liquid like  water. Seldom though did we trouble to do this, eating the insipid  cucumber-like fruit as we found it, but though refreshing and capable  of supporting life, the longing for water is always present in the  desert.    And thus, trekking by night, and resting by day as much as the terrific  heat would allow, we worked our tedious way into the heart of the  desert; and now the magnitude of the task before me was becoming more  fully apparent every day. For, toil as our willing beasts would, it was  obvious that each long night's exhausting trek barely carried us ten  miles forward as the crow flies. The dunes were each day becoming  higher, till they were veritable mountains of sand, the patches of  t'samma became less and less frequent, and it was evident that at any  time they might fail altogether. All this time we saw no sign of human  life, not even a solitary spoor upon the tell-tale sand. Animal life,  however, there was in abundance, and we had no need to leave our path  to shoot as much game as we required.    At times, on cresting the brow of a dune, we would come close upon a  herd of gemsbok in the long \"aar\" beneath us; magnificent animals,  whose long, straight, saber-like horns are feared even by the lion.  Fearless of man, the whole troop would stand as one, gazing straight at  us, immovable as statues, until we were within a few yards of them;  then their leader, usually a magnificent bull, with horns of well on to  four feet, would give a toss of his head and a stamp of his foot, and  away the whole troop would fly; wheeling, trotting, halting and turning  to gaze at us again, in such perfect unison, that they reminded one  irresistibly of a well-drilled troop of cavalry.    Or a flock of ostriches would career across our path, their huge  strides covering the ground at an incredible pace; queer-looking  hartebeest were also plentiful, and duiker, steenbok, and smaller fry  abounded everywhere.    Of lions we saw but little, though their spoors were abundant, and  occasionally we heard them at night; the spoors of leopards were  everywhere but these wily animals are seldom seen unless hunted for and  often a pack of the dreaded wild hunting-dogs would stream across our  path in pursuit of its quarry.    For strangely enough all of these animals appear to be absolutely  independent of water, and some of them notably the gemsbok, apparently  never drink.    There came a day when we entered an entirely different region, though  still the sand stretched in all directions. But now the dunes were no  longer either uniform in height or parallel as they had been, but  tossed and tumbled in all directions in the utmost confusion; and here  also t'samma, and in fact all vegetation, ceased. We reached this  region of awful desolation a little after sunrise one morning, coming  upon it abruptly from the edge of a dune whose hollow held the usual  vegetation in plenty.    With my field-glasses I scanned the bare and barren waste before us in  all directions, but no sign of life or vegetation broke the monotony of  its awful desolation. I looked at Inyati, peering from under his palm  in the same direction, and he answered my unspoken question.    \"Yes, master, we must cross it. It runs for many days' journey north  and south, and we cannot go round. I crossed it when I came, but  farther south; and I found a little t'samma then. And yet I nearly  died!\"    That day the heat was very great, and here there were no bushes to give  us a particle of shade. A few stunted \"gar-boomen\" there were, and the  horses ate eagerly of the long bunches of bean-like fruit hanging from  them; but their thin, withered foliage was no protection against the  terrific power of the sun. Then Inyati showed me a Bushman trick; for,  burrowing in the side of the dune, he soon made a considerable hollow,  and breaking down the brittle \"gar\" bushes he roofed it over, throwing  a whole pile of other bushes on top till it was light-proof enough to  at least break some of the sun's glare.    And into this we crawled, and stewed till evening brought us some  little respite.    Meanwhile we had discussed our chances of getting across.    \"Three days, at least, my master, it will take the horses; and if we  find no t'samma they will die. It is drier than when I crossed. But if  we go not east, but turn somewhat to the south, there is a pan. It is  two days only but who knows if there is water there? Still, mayhap,  that is the better path.\" That night we had to wait late before  trekking, as the moon was waning, and in the hideous jumble of dunes  before us, we feared to trust solely to the stars. We were glad to rest  too, and let our horses rest and take their fill of the last t'samma  they were likely to get.    I lay smoking in the dark, waiting for the moon to rise, and listening  to the \"crunch, crunch\" of the horses still steadily feeding, when a  low call from Inyati made me spring to my feet, He had climbed to the  top of the highest dune, and at his second call I ploughed my way up  through the loose sand till I stood beside him. He was pointing away to  the south-east.    \"A fire, master,\" he said; \"there are men there; that must be our way,  for there must there be t'samma, or water!\"    Sure enough a tiny fire was flickering far away, and apparently on the  far horizon, though it is almost impossible to judge of the distance of  a fire by night.    At any rate, it certainly seemed better for us to try to make our way  to it, and without waiting longer for the moon we saddled up and  started our floundering way across the labyrinth of dunes in its  direction.    All night long we followed the faint gleam, which faded and vanished as  morning found us, well-nigh exhausted, in the midst of the wilderness  of bare sand.    But, though I could see nothing, Inyati's keen eyes made out a thin"]]]
