It is better to use blue paper, so  that the white spores can be seen more clearly. The Agarics are divided  into classes according to the color of the spores, so it is of great  importance to examine them. The shape and size of the spores can only be  learned by the use of a microscope. We have not attempted in this  elementary work to do more than mention them.      [Illustration: Amanita vaginata    (breaking from volva).    Photographed by C. G. Lloyd.]      THE VOLVA AND VEIL.    The universal veil or volva is a thin covering which encloses the entire  young plant. The cap grows and expands and bursts this veil into  fragments. That part of the veil which breaks away from the cap, called  the secondary veil, forms the annulus or ring. It resembles a collar,  and is generally fastened to the stem. It is not always permanent or  fixed in one place. It may disappear when the plant is mature. It is  often fragile, loose and torn, and sometimes is movable on the stem.    The name volva is particularly given to that part of the universal veil  which remains around the base of the stem, either sheathing it or  appressed closely to it, or in torn fragments. The volva and ring, or  annulus, are not always present in mushrooms. The rupture of the veil  often causes a part of it to remain on the cap in the shape of warts or  scales. These may disappear as the plant grows older, and are sometimes  washed off by a heavy rain.      THE TUBES OR PORES.    There is a group of fungi called Polyporei, which have tubes or pores  instead of gills. They are placed under the pileus just as the gills are  situated, and contain the spores. The length of the tubes varies. The  mouths or openings are also of different shapes and sizes. They are  sometimes round, and at other times irregular. The color of the mouths  is often different from the tubes, and changes when mature. The mouths,  too, are sometimes stuffed when young. The attachment to the pileus is  to be noted. They may be free or easily detached, depressed around the  stem or fastened to it (adnate.)          CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI.      The color of both gills and tubes is an important feature in the  classification of fungi.    We have now arrived at a point where the amateur may become wearied at  the reading of long names and the enumeration of classes and genera.  Stevenson has said in his preface to his work on British Fungi that  \"there is no royal road to the knowledge of fungi,\" and if we become  enough interested to pursue the subject we will probably discover it at  this point. We will try and make this part as simple as possible, and  only mention those genera which are most common.    Mushrooms may be divided into three great classes:    I. Gasteromycetes, or \"Stomach fungi,\" where the spores are produced  within the plant.    II. Ascomycetes, or \"Spore sac fungi,\" where the spores are produced in  delicate sacs called asci.    III. Hymenomycetes, or \"Membrane fungi,\" where the spores are produced  on the lower surface of the cap.      CLASS III. HYMENOMYCETES, OR MEMBRANE FUNGI.    This class is divided into six orders:    1. Gill-bearing mushrooms, Agarics, or Agaricini.    2. Fungi with pores or tubes, Polyporei.    3. Fungi with awl-shaped teeth or spines, Hydnei.    4. Fungi with an even spore-bearing or slightly wrinkled surface,  Thelephorei.    5. Plants, club-shaped and simple, or bush-like and branched, Clavariei.    6. Gelatinous plants, irregularly expanded, Tremellinei.    The first order, the Agarics, contains most of the well-known mushrooms,  as well as most of the edible ones. They have been divided into  different classes according to the color of the spores. In a great many  cases the color is the same as that of the gills; but this is not always  the case, especially in the young plants. The Agarics are divided into  four sections:    1. White spores, Leucosporae.    2. Rosy, salmon or pinkish spores, Rhodosporae.    3. Brown or ochraceous spores, Ochrosporae.    4. Dark purplish or black spores, Melanosporae.    There are an infinite number of mushrooms we shall not mention. The  study of fungi has only begun in this country, and there is an immense  vista for future students. The amateur or beginner may be well satisfied  if after one summer spent in studying mushrooms he can remember the  distinguishing types of the various genera, and can say with certainty,  \"This is a Russula, or this a Cortinarius, or this a Tricholoma.\" He  will then feel he has taken one important step in this \"royal road.\"      DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF GENERA OF HYMENOMYCETES.    ORDER 1. AGARICS.    The names of the genera are all derived from Greek and Latin words.  Stevenson, in his book on British Fungi, has given the original words  and also their meanings. We take the liberty of copying the English term  only, and will place it beside the name of each genus.    SECTION 1. WHITE SPORES, OR LEUCOSPORAE.    The first genus we will mention is:    +HYGROPHORUS, from a word meaning moist.+    This genus contains plants growing on the ground. They soon decay. The  cap is sticky or watery, the gills often branched. It has a peculiarity  in the fact that the hymenial cells, or the layer of mother cells,  contained in the gills, change into a waxy mass, at length removable  from the trama. The trama is that substance which extends with and is  like in structure to the layer of mother cells.[1] It lies between the  two layers of gills in Agarics. The gills seem full of watery juice, and  they are more or less decurrent, _i. e._, extend down the stem. This  genus contains many bright-colored and shining species.      [Footnote 1: In the young plant it forms the framework of the gills.]    We are obliged to refer to the hymenial layer in this place, though the  beginner will scarcely understand the meaning of the term. The  distinguishing peculiarity of this genus consists in the cells changing  to a waxy mass. In the chapter on the structure of mushrooms we have  tried to explain something about the cells and the Hymenium.    +LACTARIUS = milk.+    This genus is fleshy, growing on the ground; the cap is often depressed  in the centre. The gills are adnato-decurrent, that is, partly attached  and prolonged down the stem. They are waxy, rather rigid and acute at  the edge. The distinctive feature is the milk that flows when the gills  are cut. Sometimes the milk changes color.    +RUSSULA = red.+    This genus grows on the ground, is fleshy, and soon decays. The cap is  depressed, or becomes so at a later stage of growth. The stem is  polished, generally white, and is very brittle. The gills are rigid,  fragile, with an acute edge, and mostly equal in length. Some species  exude watery drops. It contains many species of beautiful colors.    +CANTHARELLUS = vase or cup.+    The principal characteristic of this genus consists in the fold-like  nature of its gills. The gills are thick, with an obtuse edge, and are  branched and decurrent. The genus is fleshy, soft, and putrescent, and  has no veil. Some plants grow on the ground and others on mosses.    +MARASMIUS = to wither.+    The genus is tough and dry, not decaying, but shrivelling, and reviving  when wet. The stem is tough (cartilaginous.) The gills are rather  distant, the edge acute and entire. The plants often have a peculiar  smell and taste, like garlic. They are small and thin, commonly growing  on the outside of another plant (epiphytal) on the ground, on putrid  leaves, or on roots of grasses.    +AMANITA.+    The origin of this name is doubtful. Galen, an ancient Greek physician,  is said to have given the name to some edible fungi (Stevenson). It is  distinguished as the only genus that has _both volva and ring_. The  young plant is enveloped by a universal veil which bursts at maturity.  The volva around the base of the stem is formed by the splitting or  bursting of the veil, and its different modes of rupture mark the  several species. It is sometimes shaped very prettily, and has the  appearance of a cup around the stem. It contains many poisonous as well  as edible mushrooms.    +LEPIOTA = a scale.+    This genus has a universal veil. The gills are free. Sometimes the ring,  or annulus, is movable on the stem. The cap is often covered with warts,  or the skin torn into scales, and the stem sometimes inserted in a cup  or socket.    +ARMILLARIA = ring or bracelet.+    There is no universal veil in this genus, only a partial one that forms  a ring, or sometimes only indicating the ring by scales. The species  usually grow on the ground.    +TRICHOLOMA = from two Greek words, hair and fringe.+    This genus is especially noted for its sinuate gills. They have a tooth  next to the stem. All grow on the ground and are fleshy. There are  sometimes fibrils which adhere to the margin of the cap, the remains of  the veil. There are no plants in this genus that are considered  poisonous.    +CLITOCYBE = a declivity.+    The gills in this genus are attenuated behind and are attached to stem  (adnate) or run down it (decurrent.) The cap is generally plano  depressed or funnel-shaped (infundibuliform). Some are fragrant; the  odor resembles fresh apricots.    +COLLYBIA = a small coin.+    The stem in this genus is tough or stuffed with a pith, and covered with  a cartilaginous rind. The margin of the cap is smooth and turned under  at first (involute). The gills are soft, free, or only adnexed behind.  The plants grow on the outside of wood and leaves, even on fungi, but  are often rooted on the ground, and do not dry up. The gills are  sometimes brightly colored.    +MYCENA = a fungus.+    In this genus also the stem is cartilaginous, the cap is sometimes  bell-shaped (campanulate) and slender. The plants are generally small  and fragile. The cap is from 1/8 to 1 1/2 inch broad. The stem is  sometimes filiform, and they grow on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18458"],[0,"Star Born (#4)"],[1," changed to a purr as if she, too,  were rejoicing at the success of their desperate try. For the first  time in weary weeks Raf remembered his own duties which would begin  when the _RS 10_ came in to a flame-cushioned landing on a new world.  He was to assemble and ready the small exploration flyer, to man its  controls and take it up and out. Frowning, he began to run over in his  mind each step in the preparations he must make as soon as they  planeted.    Information came down from control, where now the ports were open on  normal space and the engines were under control of the spacer's pilot.  Their goal was to be the third planet, one which showed signs of  atmosphere, of water and earth ready and waiting.    Those who were not on flight duty crowded into the tiny central cabin,  where they elbowed each other before the viewer. The ball of alien  earth grew from a pinpoint to the size of an orange. They forgot time  in the wonder which none had ever thought in his heart he would see on  the screen. Raf knew that in control every second of this was being  recorded as they began to establish a braking orbit, which with luck  would bring them down on the surface of the new world.    \"Cities--those must be cities!\" Those in the cabin studied the plate  with awe as the information filtered through the crew. Lablet, their  xenobiologist, sat with his fingers rigid on the lower bar of the visa  plate, so intent that nothing could break his vigil, while the rest  speculated wildly. Had they really seen cities?    Raf went down the corridor to the door of the sealed compartment that  held the machine and the supplies for which he was responsible. These  last hours of waiting were worse with their nagging suspense than all  the time which had gone before. If they could only set down!    He had, on training trips which now seemed very far in the past, trod  the rust-red desert country of Mars, waddled in a bulky protective  suit across the peaked ranges of the dead Moon, known something of the  larger asteroids. But how would it feel to tread ground warmed by the  rays of another sun? Imagination with which his superiors did not  credit him began to stir. Traits inherited from a mixture of races  were there to be summoned. Raf retreated once more into his cabin and  sat on his bunk pad, staring down at his own capable mechanic's hands  without seeing them, picturing instead all the wonders which might lie  just beyond the next few hours' imprisonment in this metallic shell he  had grown to hate with a dull but abiding hatred.    Although he knew that Hobart must be fully as eager as any of them to  land, it seemed to Raf, and the other impatient crew members, that  they were very long in entering the atmosphere of the chosen world. It  was only when the order came to strap down for deceleration that they  were in a measure satisfied. Pull of gravity, ship beaming in at an  angle which swept it from night to day or night again as it encircled  that unknown globe. They could not watch their objective any longer.  The future depended entirely upon the skill of the three men in  control--and last of all upon Hobart's judgment and skill.    The captain brought them down, riding the flaming counter-blasts from  the ship's tail to set her on her fins in an expert point landing, so  that the _RS 10_ was a finger of light into the sky, amid wisps of  smoke from brush ignited by her landing.    There was another wait which seemed endless to the restless men  within, a wait until the air was analyzed, the countryside surveyed.  But when the go-ahead signal was given and the ramp swung out, those  first at the hatch still hesitated for an instant or so, though the  way before them was open.    Beyond the burnt ground about the ship was a rolling plain covered  with tall grass which rippled under the wind. And the freshness of  that wind cleansed their lungs of the taint of the ship.    Raf pulled off his helmet, held his head high in that breeze. It was  like bathing in air, washing away the smog of those long days of  imprisonment. He ran down the ramp, past the little group of those who  had preceded him, and fell on his knees in the grass, catching at it  with his hands, a little over-awed at the wonder of it all.    The wide sweep of sky above them was not entirely blue, he noted.  There was the faintest suggestion of green, and across it moved clouds  of silver. But, save for the grass, they might be in a dead and empty  world. Where were the cities? Or had those been born of imagination?    After a while, when the wonder of this landing had somewhat worn away,  Hobart summoned them back to the prosaic business of setting up base.  And Raf went to work at his own task. The sealed storeroom was opened,  the supplies slung by crane down from the ship. The compact assembly,  streamlined for this purpose, was all ready for the morrow.    They spent the night within the ship, much against their will. After  the taste of freedom they had been given, the cramped interior weighed  upon them, closing like a prison. Raf lay on his pad unable to sleep.  It seemed to him that he could hear, even through the heavy plates,  the sigh of that refreshing wind, the call of the open world lying  ready for them. Step by step in his mind, he went through the process  for which he would be responsible the next day. The uncrating of the  small flyer, the assembling of frame and motor. And sometime in the  midst of that survey he did fall asleep, so deeply that Wonstead had  to shake him awake in the morning.    He bolted his food and was out at his job before it was far past dawn.  But eager as he was to get to work, he paused just to look at the  earth scuffed up by his boots, to stare for a long moment at a stalk  of tough grass and remember with a thrill which never lessened that  this was not native earth or grass, that he stood where none of his  race, or even of his kind, had stood before--on a new planet in a new  solar system.    Raf's expert training and instruction paid off. By evening he had the  flitter assembled save for the motor which still reposed on the  turning block. One party had gone questing out into the grass and  returned with the story of a stream hidden in a gash in the plain, and  Wonstead carried the limp body of a rabbit-sized furred creature he  had knocked over at the waterside.    \"Acted tame.\" Wonstead was proud of his kill. \"Stupid thing just stood  and watched me while I let fly with a stone.\"    Raf picked up the little body. Its fur was red-brown, plush-thick, and  very soft to the touch. The breast was creamy white and the forepaws  curiously short with an uncanny resemblance to his own hands. Suddenly  he wished that Wonstead had not killed it, though he supposed that  Chou, their biologist, would be grateful. But the animal looked  particularly defenseless. It would have been better not to mark their  first day on this new world with a killing--even if it were the  knocking over of a stupid rabbit thing. The pilot was glad when Chou  bore it off and he no longer had to look at it.    It was after the evening meal that Raf was called into consultation by  the officers to receive his orders. When he reported that the flitter,  barring unexpected accidents, would be air-borne by the following  afternoon, he was shown an enlarged picture from the records made  during the descent of the _RS 10_.    There was a city, right enough--showing up well from the air. Hobart  stabbed a finger down into the heart of it.    \"This lies south from here. We'll cruise in that direction.\"    Raf would have liked to ask some questions of his own. The city  photographed was a sizable one. Why then this deserted land here? Why  hadn't the inhabitants been out to investigate the puzzle of the space  ship's landing? He said slowly, \"I've mounted one gun, sir. Do you  want the other installed? It will mean that the flitter can only carry  three instead of four--\"    Hobart pulled his lower lip between his thumb and forefinger. He  glanced at his lieutenant then to Lablet, sitting quietly to one side.  It was the latter who spoke first.    \"I'd say this shows definite traces of retrogression.\" He touched the  photograph. \"The place may even be only a ruin.\"    \"Very well. Leave off the other gun,\" Hobart ordered crisply. \"And be  ready to fly at dawn day after tomorrow with full field kit. You're  sure she'll have at least a thousand-mile cruising radius?\"    Raf suppressed a shrug. How could you tell what any machine would do  under new conditions? The flitter had been put through every possible  test in his home world. Whether she would perform as perfectly here  was another matter.    \"They thought she would, sir,\" he replied. \"I'll take her up for a  shakedown run tomorrow after the motor is installed.\"    Captain Hobart dismissed him with a nod, and Raf was glad to clatter  down ladders into the cool of the evening once more. Flying high in a  formation of two lanes were some distant birds, at least he supposed  they were birds. But he did not call attention to them. Instead he  watched them out of sight, lingering alone with no desire to join  those crew members who had built a campfire a little distance from the  ship. The flames were familiar and cheerful, a portion, somehow, of  their native world transported to the new.    Raf could hear the murmur of voices. But he turned and went to the  flitter. Taking his hand torch, he checked the work he had done during  the day. To-morrow--tomorrow he could take her up into the blue-green  sky, circle out over the sea of grass for a short testing flight. That  much he wanted to do.    But the thought of the cruise south, of venturing toward that  sprawling splotch Hobart and Lablet identified as a city was somehow  distasteful, and he was reluctant to think about it.          3    SNAKE-DEVIL'S TRAIL      Dalgard drew the waterproof covering back over his brow, making a  cheerful "]]]
