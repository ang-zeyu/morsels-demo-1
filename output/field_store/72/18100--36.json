[Illustration: Example 3.  Rhythm.]    The first measure of this hymn is, by itself, merely an exponent of the  metric principle, for it consists of three uniform quarter-notes.  The  second measure, however, is a rhythmic one, because, by dotting the  first of the three beats, three different time-values are obtained  (dotted quarter, eighth, and quarter).  Further, by association and  comparison with each other, both measures assume a collective rhythmic  significance.    The rhythmic disposition of the tones is to a certain extent optional  with the composer, but by no means wholly so; the rules of rhythm are  probably the most definite and obvious of all the rules of music  writing.  They do not concern the analytical student intimately, but at  least the general distinction between regular and irregular rhythm  should be understood:--We have seen that the natural accent (the  \"heavy\" pulse) is invariably represented by the first beat of a  rhythmic group; and that one or two lighter pulses intervene before the  next accent appears.  Further, it is self-evident that the rhythmic  weight of a tone is proportionate to its length, or time-value; longer  tones produce heavier, and shorter tones lighter, impressions.  The  deduction from these two facts is, then, that the rhythmic arrangement  is _regular_ when the comparatively longer tones occupy the accented  beats, or the accented fractions of the beats; and _irregular_ when  shorter tones occupy the accents, or when longer tones are shifted to  any comparatively lighter pulse of the measure or group.    The rhythm of the second measure in Ex. 3 is regular, because the  longest tone stands at the beginning of the measure, thus confirming  (and, in fact, creating) the accent.  The rhythm in Ex. 1 is also  regular, throughout, the light eighth-notes occupying the light third  beat, and the heavy dotted-quarter the heavy pulse (in the third  measure).  Ex. 2 is strikingly definite in rhythm, because the  time-values are so greatly diversified; and the arrangement is regular.    On the other hand, the following is an example of irregular rhythm:    [Illustration: Example 4.  Fragment of Beethoven.]      The longer (heavier) tones are placed in the middle of the measure,  between the beats; the tie at the end of measure 3 places the heavy  note at the end, instead of the beginning, of the measure, and cancels  the accent of the fourth measure.  These irregular forms of rhythm are  called syncopation.  See also Ex. 6, second Phrase.      MELODY.--Any succession of _single_ tones is a melody.  If we strike  the keys of the piano with two or more fingers of each hand  simultaneously, we produce a body of tones, which--if they are so  chosen that they blend harmoniously--is called a Chord; and a series of  such chords is an illustration of what is known as Harmony.  If,  however, we play with one finger only, we produce a melody.  The human  voice, the flute, horn,--all instruments capable of emitting but one  tone at a time,--produce melody.    Melody constitutes, then, a _line of tones_.  If, as we have said, Time  is the canvas upon which the musical images are thrown, Melodies are  the lines which trace the design or form of these images.  This  indicates the extreme importance of the melodic idea in music form.  Without such \"tone-lines\" the effect would be similar to that of daubs  or masses of color without a drawing, without the evidence of contour  and shape.    A _good_ melody, that is, a melody that appeals to the intelligent  music lover as tuneful, pleasing, and intelligible, is one in which,  first of all, each successive tone and each successive group of tones  stands in a rational harmonic relation to the one before it, and even,  usually, to several preceding tones or groups.  In other words, the  tones are not arranged haphazard, but with reference to their  harmonious agreement with each other.  For a model of good melody,  examine the very first sentence in the book of Beethoven's pianoforte  sonatas:--    [Illustration: Example 5.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    The tones bracketed _a_, if struck all together, unite and blend in one  harmonious body, so complete is the harmonic agreement of each  succeeding tone with its fellows; the same is true of the group marked  _c_.  The tones bracketed _b_ and _d_ do not admit of being struck  simultaneously, it is true, but they are all parts of the same key (F  minor), and are closely and smoothly connected; hence their  concurrence, though not one of harmony (chord), is one of intimate tone  relation and proximity.  Further, the whole group marked 2 corresponds  in its linear formation, its rising, poising and curling, exactly to  the preceding group, marked 1.  This, then, is a _good_  melody,--tuneful, interesting, intelligible, striking and absolutely  definite.    In the second place, the tones and groups in a good melody are measured  with reference to harmony of time-values; that is, their metric  condition, and their rhythmic arrangement, corroborate the natural laws  already defined:--uniformity of fundamental pulse, uniform recurrence  of accent, and sufficient regularity of rhythmic figure to insure a  distinct and comprehensible total impression.  This also may be  verified in the time-values of Ex. 5.  Scrutinize also, the melodic and  rhythmic conditions of Exs. 1 and 2,--and the examples on later  pages,--and endeavor to vindicate their classification as \"good\"  melodies.  Ex. 4, though an exposition of irregular rhythm, is none the  less excellent on that account; on the contrary, this irregularity,  because wisely balanced by sufficient evidence of harmonious and  logical agreement, only heightens the beauty and effectiveness of the  melody.          *      *      *      *      *      *    Whenever whole bodies of tone are played successively, a number of  melody lines are being described,--as many, in fact, as there are tones  in each body.  For example, in playing a hymn-tune we describe (on the  keyboard) the four separate melodies known as the soprano, alto, tenor  and bass voices.  In a duet, unaccompanied, there are two melodic  lines; if accompanied, other melodic lines are added to these.  Thus we  recognize the same system of associated lines in music as in  architecture or drawing.  Very rarely indeed does one single unbroken  line portray a complete image.    But in music, as in drawing, the lines differ in their degrees of  importance and prominence; and, very commonly, one line over-shadows  all, or nearly all the rest.  This strongest tone-line is therefore apt  to be designated, somewhat unfairly, _the_ melody (the \"tune\" or \"air\"  is more just).  But, at all events, _this predominating melodic line is  the most important factor of the form, the one upon which the  definition and recognition of the \"form\" depend_; and it is therefore  necessary that the student learn to distinguish it, to acquire the  habit of centring his attention upon it,--in reading, listening to, or  analyzing music; and, in playing, to give it the emphasis it requires.    The importance of a tone-line depends solely upon its conspicuousness.  The principal melody--_the_ Melody--is the one which is most salient,  which most attracts the hearer's attention.  For this reason the  composer is induced to place his chief melody _above the rest of the  tone-lines, because the uppermost tone strikes the ear more acutely  than the lower ones_, and therefore the succession of highest tones  constitutes a conspicuous line that attracts and impresses the sense  most keenly.    Here then, at the top of the harmonic tone-complex, we look for the  chief melody; and here it will be found,--excepting when arbitrary  emphasis (by accentuation) is imparted to some lower tone-line, so that  it, for the time being, assumes a prominence equal, or superior, to  that of the uppermost line.  (This divided prominence is seen in the  18th Song Without Words--the _duet_.)      LESSON 2.--Write careful and complete answers to the following  questions:--    1.

FIGURE AND MOTIVE.    THE MELODIC FIGURE.--The smallest unit in musical composition is the  single tone.  The smallest cluster of successive tones (from two to  four or five in number) that will convey a definite musical impression,  as miniature musical idea, is called a Figure.  Assuming the single  tone to represent the same unit of expression as a letter of the  alphabet, the melodic figure would be defined as the equivalent of a  complete (small) word;--pursuing the comparison further, a series of  figures constitutes the melodic Motive, equivalent to the smallest  group of words (a subject with its article and adjective, for example);  and two or three motives make a Phrase, equivalent to the complete,  though comparatively brief, sentence (subject, predicate, and object).

Toward the close of the meal, phonotelephotic  communication was made with Paris. Smith saw his wife, seated alone at  the dinner-table, looking anything but pleased at her loneliness.    \"Pardon me, my dear, for having left you alone,\" he said through the  telephone. \"I was with Dr. Wilkins.\"    \"Ah, the good doctor!\" remarked Mrs. Smith, her countenance lighting up.    \"Yes. But, pray, when are you coming home?\"    \"This evening.\"    \"Very well. Do you come by tube or by air-train?\"    \"Oh, by tube.\"    \"Yes; and at what hour will you arrive?\"    \"About eleven, I suppose.\"    \"Eleven by Centropolis time, you mean?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Good-by, then, for a little while,\" said Mr. Smith as he severed  communication with Paris.    Dinner over, Dr. Wilkins wished to depart. \"I shall expect you at ten,\"  said Mr Smith. \"To-day, it seems, is the day for the return to life of  the famous Dr. Faithburn. You did not think of it, I suppose. The  awakening is to take place here in my house. You must come and see. I  shall depend on your being here.\"    \"I will come back,\" answered Dr. Wilkins.    Left alone, Mr. Smith busied himself with examining his accounts--a task  of vast magnitude, having to do with transactions which involve a daily  expenditure of upward of $800,000. Fortunately, indeed, the stupendous  progress of mechanic art in modern times makes it comparatively easy.  Thanks to the Piano Electro-Reckoner, the most complex calculations can  be made in a few seconds. In two hours Mr. Smith completed his task.  Just in time. Scarcely had he turned over the last page when Dr. Wilkins  arrived. After him came the body of Dr. Faithburn, escorted by a  numerous company of men of science. They commenced work at once. The  casket being laid down in the middle of the room, the telephote was got  in readiness. The outer world, already notified, was anxiously  expectant, for the whole world could be eye-witnesses of the  performance, a reporter meanwhile, like the chorus in the ancient drama,  explaining it all _viva voce_ through the telephone.    \"They are opening the casket,\" he explained. \"Now they are taking  Faithburn out of it--a veritable mummy, yellow, hard, and dry. Strike  the body and it resounds like a block of wood. They are now applying  heat; now electricity. No result. These experiments are suspended for a  moment while Dr. Wilkins makes an examination of the body. Dr. Wilkins,  rising, declares the man to be dead. 'Dead!' exclaims every one present.  'Yes,' answers Dr. Wilkins, 'dead!' 'And how long has he been dead?' Dr.  Wilkins makes another examination. 'A hundred years,' he replies.\"    The case stood just as the reporter said. Faithburn was dead, quite  certainly dead! \"Here is a method that needs improvement,\" remarked Mr.  Smith to Dr. Wilkins, as the scientific committee on hibernation bore  the casket out. \"So much for that experiment. But if poor Faithburn is  dead, at least he is sleeping,\" he continued. \"I wish I could get some  sleep. I am tired out, Doctor, quite tired out! Do you not think that a  bath would refresh me?\"    \"Certainly. But you must wrap yourself up well before you go out into  the hall-way. You must not expose yourself to cold.\"    \"Hall-way? Why, Doctor, as you well know, everything is done by  machinery here. It is not for me to go to the bath; the bath will come  to me. Just look!\" and he pressed a button. After a few seconds a faint  rumbling was heard, which grew louder and louder. Suddenly the door  opened, and the tub appeared.    Such, for this year of grace 2889, is the history of one day in the life  of the editor of the Earth Chronicle. And the history of that one day  is the history of 365 days every year, except leap-years, and then of  366 days--for as yet no means has been found of increasing the length of  the terrestrial year.
