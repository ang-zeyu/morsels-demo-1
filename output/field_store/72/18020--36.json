My wife, the maid, and myself can vouch for the accuracy of  these statements, also friends to whom we have related these facts.                        \"MUNSTER.\"      Letter 6      _Mrs. E.J. Ellis's Story--\"The Old Woman's Cat\"_    My wife, writes Mr. Ellis, who was brought up in Germany, and who is not  sufficiently confident about her English to attempt to put down anything  for publication in that language, tells me the following story for the  _Occult Review_:--    \"When I was a little girl living with my family near Michelstadt in the  Odenwald, I remember an old woman like an old witch, whose name was  Louise, and who was called 'Pfeiffe Louise,' because she exhibited pipes  for sale in her cottage window, along with the cheap dress-stuffs,  needles and threads, and simple toys for children which were her  stock-in-trade. She had a favourite cat which was devoted to her, but  its attachment doesn't seem to have been enough to make her happy, for  she married a young sergeant named Lautenschlager, who might have been  her son--or indeed her grandson--and who, as everyone said, courted her  for her money. She died as long ago as 1869, and during her last illness  the devoted cat was always with her. It kept watch beside the body when  she was dead, and refused to be driven away. In a fit of exasperation  Lautenschlager seized it, carried it off, and drowned it in the little  River Mumling, at a place where the road from Michelstadt to the  neighbouring village Steinbach runs near the water's edge. It was  bordered with poplars then, but chestnut trees shade it now.    \"Soon after his first wife was buried Lautenschlager married again, and  opened an eating-house in Steinbach, where he established his second  wife. He had a sister whom he placed in the cottage of poor 'Pfeiffe  Louise.' She carried on the business, and every day Lautenschlager used  to walk over from Steinbach to see how she was getting on, returning in  the evening to his wife, who used to relate to my mother that he  frequently came home terrified and bathed in perspiration, for as he  passed the place where he had drowned the cat, its ghost used to come  out of the river and run beside him along the dark road, sometimes  terrifying him still more by jumping in front of him.    \"After a few years of married life the second wife died, and  Lautenschlager married a third. The little cottage business had  prospered, and in its place he now had a considerable draper's shop in  Michelstadt. He continued to walk over from Steinbach, where now the  third wife lived in the eating-house, and the ghost of the cat continued  to frighten him by appearing at nightfall as he walked beside the river.    \"I can remember hearing his third wife describe his dread of it, and my  mother has told me how both the sister and the second wife used to say  the same thing, though I was too young then for them to tell me about  it. Lautenschlager used also to complain to the country people who came  to dine at his eating-house. He considered himself an ill-used man, and  felt that the supernatural powers were treating him very hardly, and  subjecting him to a real persecution. I have only the conversation of  his wife and the gossip of the village to vouch for his sincerity, and  the genuineness of the apparition is supported only by Lautenschlager's  word, but his evident anger and agitation were accepted as genuine, and  no one dreamed of doubting his word. He was not at all a dreamy or  imaginative man, and did not drink. His passion was merely momentary. He  was not only a draper and caterer but a usurer, and realized something  of a fortune by lending money on good security to peasants and farmers  who, it was said, did not consider how they bound themselves when they  signed the papers he put before them.    \"Lautenschlager continued to be haunted by the cat-ghost at irregular  intervals for more than twenty years, and it made a marked change in his  character. He became serious, and during the latter part of his life  would only talk about religion and read sacred literature. He died about  ten years ago.\"                        \"FELINE.\"      Letter 7      _A Spectral Fox-terrier_    Two or three years ago I visited a medium (Mrs. Davies of 44 Laburnum  Grove, Portsmouth). I had been seated only a few minutes when a little  pug-dog of hers looked up in the direction of my knees and down towards  my feet, growling and howling in a most strange manner.    \"What on earth is he looking at?\" I exclaimed.    \"Oh,\" said the medium, \"there is a little fox-terrier lying across your  feet; one half of his face is quite dark and the other half white, but  he has such a peculiar black patch over the eye that one would almost  think it was a black bruise.\" Now, sir, I had such a little dog in  India, but this lady did not know of him, and would never have known had  he not, as I afterwards found, died out there. This is not only a case  of the appearance of an animal after death, but also a case in which it  was seen by another animal, as also by the medium. I am also told that  the pug-dog who had this vision of my dog was once seen to pounce upon  what seemed to the medium to be several cats, near the copper in the  scullery of the same house. The medium asked a neighbour if the previous  occupants had had any cats. \"Oh, yes,\" replied the neighbour, \"and badly  the poor things were served, for they were cruelly thrown into the  copper, which was full of boiling water.\"                        \"SIMLA\" (M. Conder).      Letter 8      _Killed by a Street Car, but walks in at the Front Door_    Some five years ago we had a little puppy about six months old. I used  to train him to always go round the back way to come into the house. One  day he got hurt and run over, being instantly killed by a street car. A  day or two after the accident I was going in my front door and I saw the  dog go up the steps in front of me, as plain as I ever saw him in my  life. It seemed he knew that I had taught him he must not go in the  front way, because he would go a few steps and then turn round and look  at me, as though he wanted to see how I was taking it, and I positively  saw him go to the full length of the hall into the house, a distance of  about twenty feet, before he disappeared. I saw him do this at least  three times in two months that we stayed in that flat. I told at least a  half-dozen people of the incident at the time it happened, and I can  vouch for its authenticity.         I remain, yours truly,                        \"MAJILTON\"      (Chas. A. Thompson, Chicago, Ill., U.S.A.).      Letter 9      _Mrs. Vincent Taylor's Experience. A Spirit Purr_    One evening in February, 1906, my son and I were quietly reading, in  full gaslight, our small grey cat lying on the sofa a short distance  from where I sat. Suddenly I saw on my knee a large red and white cat  which belonged to us in India, which was a very dear family friend and  as fond of us as a child.    On leaving India we were obliged to give him to a friend, and in the end  he shared the usual fate of pets in that country, making a meal for some  wild animal.    \"Rufie-Oofie,\" in his spirit shape, purred vigorously, rubbing his head  against me and giving every sign of delight at seeing us again. I did  not speak, but in a few minutes my son looked up and said, \"Mother,  Rufie-Oofie is on your knee,\" when the spirit cat jumped down and went  to him to be petted. Then he returned to me, and walked along the sofa  to where our present cat, \"Kim,\" was asleep. The spirit cat, with a look  of almost human fun, patted Kim's head, the latter awaking with a start.  Rufie-Oofie continued to make playful dabs at Kim's ears, Kim following  each movement with glaring eyes, distinctly seeing and realizing that  another cat was invading his sofa, but not in the least angry with him  and quite ready to play. After a few minutes the spirit cat came back to  my knee, whereupon the earth cat displayed jealousy which Rufie-Oofie  resented, but before they came to actual \"words\" the spirit cat retired  behind the veil.                        \"ARJUeNA.\"      Letter 10      SIR,    The following notes of psychological experiences with animals may be of  interest:--    I had a collie who lived to a good old age. She was deaf and infirm, and  one hind-leg was paralysed, so that it dragged as she walked. I was  taken ill, not seriously, nor so as in any way to affect my brain, but  as my poor old dog would insist on coming and lying in my room the  doctor insisted on her being destroyed. I felt that her life was no  pleasure to her, and she was killed with chloroform. Three days  afterwards in the afternoon I heard her come upstairs with her dragging  hind-leg. I heard her steps come along the long passage which had my  room at the end, and lost them about half-way up. On the third day I  called her and spoke to her, putting out my hand as if she would come  and put her head under it, and told her all was right. I never heard her  any more.    I believe that on one occasion she told me by thought transference that  she had no water in her pan. The pan was always filled, and I knew that  she wanted something, but thought of all other wants but water. She made  her eyes protrude, and looked at me intently, and \"water\" flashed into  my mind. I looked and found the pan empty. It is, of course, possible  that the suggestion came from my own subconscious mind. I never saw the  aura of a human being, but I once had a kind of vision of this dog,  which experts have told me was her aura. I was sitting by the fire,  somewhat somnolent, and he was lying on the hearthrug. All at once his  golden brown coat disappeared,"]]]
