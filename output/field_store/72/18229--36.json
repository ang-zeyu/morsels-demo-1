Of these the  INTERNATIONAL will contain the choicest selections.    III. Of the Quarterly Reviews the most admirable papers will be  presented in full; and those works will in all cases be carefully  examined for such valuable and striking passages as will be likely to  interest the American reader, to whom the entire articles in which they  appear may be unattractive.    IV. The Literary, Religious, Political and Scientific newspapers and  magazines will be consulted for whatever will instruct or entertain in  their several departments. The leading articles in the great journals,  upon Affairs, and Philosophy, and Art, which are now very unfrequently  reprinted in America, will appear in the INTERNATIONAL in such fullness  and combination as to display the springs and processes of the world's  action and condition.    V. But the work will not be altogether Foreign, nor a mere compilation.  In its republications there will be a constant effort to display what is  most interesting and important to the _American_; and in its original  portions it will be supported by some of the ablest and most  accomplished writers in all the fields of knowledge and opinion.    VI. As a Literary Gazette and Examiner, it is believed that it will  equal or surpass any work now or ever printed in the United States. It  will contain the earliest announcements of whatever movements in the  literary world are of chief interest to general readers; its Reviews of  Books will be honest and intelligent; and its extracts, when they can be  given in advance of the publication of the works themselves, will be the  choicest and most valuable possible. Without cant or hypocrisy, or the  influence of any clique of feeble-minded and ambitious aspirants in  letters, the INTERNATIONAL MISCELLANY will in this respect, the  publishers trust, win and preserve the respect and confidence of all who  look to published critical judgments as guides for the reading or  purchase of books.    With a view to the more successful execution of the design to make the  INTERNATIONAL MISCELLANY of the first class in Original Periodical  Literature, as well as in Selections and Abstracts of what is already  before the world abroad, contributors have been engaged to represent the  various departments of Science, and to furnish sketches of manners, &c.,  from other countries, and the different sections of our own; the  proceedings of Learned Societies will be noted; History, Biography, and  Archaeology will receive attention; and in foreign and American Obituary,  such a record will be kept as will be of the most permanent and  attractive value.          MARTIN FARQUHAR TUPPER.      The recent appearance of some half dozen editions--some of them very  beautiful in typography and pictorial illustrations--of The Proverbial  Philosophy of Mr. MARTIN FARQUHAR TUPPER, reminds us of the observation  of Dana, that something \"resembling poetry\" is oftentimes borne into  instant and turbulent popularity, while a work of genuine character may  be lying neglected by all except the poets. But \"the tide of time,\" says  the profound essayist, \"flows on, and the former begins to settle to the  bottom, while the latter rises slowly and steadily to the surface, and  goes forward, for a spirit is in it.\" We are not without the hope that  Richard H. Dana will one day be in as frequent demand as Martin Farquhar  Tupper is now.    The merits of this \"gentleman of acknowledged genius and sovereign  popularity,\" we have never been able to discover. If oddity were always  originality, if quaintness and beauty were synonymous, if paradox were  necessarily wisdom, we should be ready to grant that Mr. Tupper is a  wise, beautiful and original thinker. But thought, after all, is an  affair of mind, and though a man of genius may write what is far more  brilliant than common sense ever is, yet no man can utter valuable truth  on mortal and prudential subjects, unless he possesses a vigorous and  powerful understanding. Now Mr. Tupper's art consists in contriving, not  thought, but things that look like thoughts; fancies, in imitation of  truths. The Proverbial Philosophy, in fact, appears to us one of the  most curious impositions we have ever met with. When you first read one  of the aphorisms, it strikes you as a sentiment of extraordinary wisdom.  But look more closely at it; try to apply it; and you will find that it  is merely a trick of words. What flashed upon you as a profound  distinction in morals, turns out to be nothing but a verbal antithesis.  What was paraded, as a kind of transcendental analogy between things not  before suspected of resemblance, discovered by the \"spiritual insight\"  of the moral seer, is in fact no more than a grave clench,--a solemn  quibble,--a conceit; arising not from the perfection of mind, but the  imperfection of language. Those conceptions, fabricated by Fancy out of  the materials that Fancy deals in, and colored by the rays of a poetic  sentiment, wear the same relation to truths, that the prismatic hues of  the spray of a fountain in the sunshine bear to the gems which it  perhaps outshines. It dazzles and delights, but if we try to apprehend  it we become bewildered; and finally discover that we were deceived by a  brilliant phantom of air. You may admire Mr. Tupper; you may enjoy him;  but you cannot understand him: the staple of his sentences is not stuff  of the understanding. Take one of Mr. Tupper's and one of Lord Bacon's  aphorisms; they flash with an equal bravery. But try them upon the  glassy surface of life. Bacon's cut it as if it were air: Tupper's turn  into a little drop of dirty water. One was a diamond, the other but an  icicle: one was the commonest liquor artificially refrigerated; the  other was a crystal in form, but in its substance the pure carbon of  truth. If these bright delusions which Mr. Tupper turns out to the  wonder and praise of his admirers, were really _thoughts_, is it to be  supposed that he would go on in this way, stringing them together, or  evolving one out of the other, as a spider weaves its unending line, or  as a boy blows soap bubbles from the nose of a tobacco pipe! Fancies,  conceits, intellectual phantoms, may be engendered out of the mind,  brooding in self-creation upon its own suggestions: but _truth_ is to be  mined from Nature, to be wrung from experience, to be seized as the  victor's trophy on the battlefield of action and suffering. The flowers  of poetry may bud spontaneously around the meditative spirit of genius,  but the harvest of Truth, though, to be reaped by mind, must grow out of  Reality.          RICHARD HENRY WILDE AND DANTE.      It appears that our accomplished and lamented countryman, Richard Henry  Wilde, whose \"Researches and Considerations concerning the Love and  Imprisonment of Tasso\" have been made use of with so discreditable a  freedom by a recent English biographer of that poet, is--if another  pretender prove not less successful--to be deprived also of the fame he  earned by his discoveries in regard to Dante. A correspondent of _The  Spectator_, under the signature of G. AUBREY BEZZI, writes as follows:--         \"The questions are, what share Mr. Kirkup had in the recovery of       the fresco of Giotto in the chapel of the Palazzo del Podesta at       Florence, and whether directly or indirectly I have been the means       of depriving him, or any of the cooeperators in that good work, of       the merit due to their labors. I shall best enable those who take       an interest in this matter to arrive at a fair conclusion, by       giving a short history of the recovery of that beautiful fresco. It       was Mr. Wilde, and not Mr. Kirkup, who first spoke to me of this       buried treasure. Mr. Wilde, an American gentleman respected by all       that knew him, was then in Florence, engaged in a work on Dante and       his times, which unfortunately he did not live to complete. Among       the materials he had collected for this purpose, there were some       papers of the antiquarian Moreni, which he was examining when I       called one day, (I had then been three or four months in Florence,)       to read what he had already written, as I was in the habit of doing       from time to time. It was then that a foot-note of Moreni's met his       eye, in which the writer lamented that he had spent two years of       his life in unceasing and unavailing efforts to recover the       portrait of Dante, and the other portions of the fresco of Giotto       in the Bargello, mentioned by Vasari; that others before him had       been equally anxious and equally unsuccessful; and that he hoped       that better times would come, (verranno tempi migliori,) and that       the painting, so interesting both in an artistic and historical       point of view, would be again sought for, and at last recovered. I       did not then understand how the efforts of Moreni and others could       have been thus unsuccessful; and I thought that with common energy       and diligence they might have ascertained whether the painting, so       clearly pointed out by Vasari, was or was not in existence: several       months, however, of wearisome labors in the same pursuit taught me       to judge more leniently of the failures of my predecessors. Mr.       Wilde put Moreni's note before me, and suggested and urged, that       being an Italian by birth, though not a Florentine, and having       lived many years in England and among the English, I had it in my       power to bring two modes of influence to bear upon the research;       and that such being the case I ought to undertake it. My thoughts       immediately turned to Mr. Kirkup, an artist who had abandoned his       art to devote himself entirely to antiquarian pursuits,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21530"],[0,"The Angel of Terror (#4)"],[1,"   He was silent for a moment.    \"When this scheme was mooted we looked round for some one to whom such a  marriage would be of advantage,\" he said, speaking slowly. \"It was  Rennett's idea that we should search the County Court records of London  to discover if there was a girl who was in urgent need of money. There  is no surer way of unearthing financial skeletons than by searching  County Court records. We found four, only one of whom was eligible and  that was you. Don't interrupt me for a moment, please,\" he said, raising  his hand warningly as she was about to speak. \"We have made thorough  inquiries about you, too thorough in fact, because the Briggerlands have  smelt a rat, and have been on our trail for a week. We know that you are  not engaged to be married, we know that you have a fairly heavy burden  of debts, and we know, too, that you are unencumbered by relations or  friends. What we offer you, Miss Beale, and believe me I feel rather a  cad in being the medium through which the offer is made, is five  thousand pounds a year for the rest of your life, a sum of twenty  thousand pounds down, and the assurance that you will not be troubled by  your husband from the moment you are married.\"    Lydia listened like one in a dream. It did not seem real. She would wake  up presently and find Mrs. Morgan with a cup of tea in her hand and a  plate of her indigestible cakes. Such things did not happen, she told  herself, and yet here was a young man, standing with his back to the  fire, explaining in the most commonplace conversational tone, an offer  which belonged strictly to the realm of romance, and not too convincing  romance at that.    \"You've rather taken my breath away,\" she said after a while. \"All this  wants thinking about, and if Mr. Meredith is in prison----\"    \"Mr. Meredith is not in prison,\" said Glover quietly. \"He was released  two days ago to go to a nursing home for a slight operation. He escaped  from the nursing home last night and at this particular moment is in  this house.\"    She could only stare at him open-mouthed, and he went on.    \"The Briggerlands know he has escaped; they probably thought he was  here, because we have had a police visitation this afternoon, and the  interior of the house and grounds have been searched. They know, of  course, that Mr. Rennett and I were his legal advisers, and we expected  them to come. How he escaped their observation is neither here nor  there. Now, Miss Beale, what do you say?\"    \"I don't know what to say,\" she said, shaking her head helplessly. \"I  know I'm dreaming, and if I had the moral courage to pinch myself hard,  I should wake up. Somehow I don't want to wake, it is so fascinatingly  impossible.\"    He smiled.    \"Can I see Mr. Meredith?\"    \"Not till to-morrow. I might say that we've made every arrangement for  your wedding, the licence has been secured and at eight o'clock  to-morrow morning--marriages before eight or after three are not legal  in this country, by the way--a clergyman will attend and the ceremony  will be performed.\"    There was a long silence.    Lydia sat on the edge of her chair, her elbows on her knees, her face in  her hands.    Glover looked down at her seriously, pityingly, cursing himself that he  was the exponent of his own grotesque scheme. Presently she looked up.    \"I think I will,\" she said a little wearily. \"And you were wrong about  the number of judgment summonses, there were seventy-five in two  years--and I'm so tired of lawyers.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Jack Glover politely.          Chapter IV      All night long she had sat in the little bedroom to which Mrs. Rennett  had led her, thinking and thinking and thinking. She could not sleep,  although she had tried hard, and most of the night she spent pacing up  and down from window to door turning over the amazing situation in which  she found herself. She had never thought of marriage seriously, and  really a marriage such as this presented no terrors and might, had the  prelude been a little less exciting, been accepted by her with relief.  The prospect of being a wife in name only, even the thought that her  husband would be, for the next twenty years, behind prison walls,  neither distressed nor horrified her. Somehow she accepted Glover's  statement that Meredith was innocent, without reservation.    She wondered what Mrs. Morgan would say and what explanation she would  give at the office. She was not particularly in love with her work, and  it would be no wrench for her to drop it and give herself up to the  serious study of art. Five thousand pounds a year! She could live in  Italy, study under the best masters, have a car of her own--the  possibilities seemed illimitable--and the disadvantages?    She shrugged her shoulders as she answered the question for the  twentieth time. What disadvantages were there? She could not marry, but  then she did not want to marry. She was not the kind to fall in love,  she told herself, she was too independent, too sophisticated, and  understood men and their weaknesses only too well.    \"The Lord designed me for an old maid,\" she said to herself.    At seven o'clock in the morning--a grey, cheerless morning it was,  thought Lydia, looking out of the window--Mrs. Rennett came in with some  tea.    \"I'm afraid you haven't slept, my dear,\" she said with a glance at the  bed. \"It's very trying for you.\"    She laid her hand upon the girl's arm and squeezed it gently.    \"And it's very trying for all of us,\" she said with a whimsical smile.  \"I expect we shall all get into fearful trouble.\"    That had occurred to the girl too, remembering the gloomy picture which  Glover had painted in the car.    \"Won't this be very serious for you, if the authorities find that you  have connived at the escape?\" she asked.    \"Escape, my dear?\" Mrs. Rennett's face became a mask. \"I have not heard  anything of an escape. All that we know is that poor Mr. Meredith,  anticipating that the Home Office would allow him to get married, had  made arrangements for the marriage at this house. How Mr. Meredith comes  here is quite a matter outside our knowledge,\" said the diplomatic lady,  and Lydia laughed in spite of herself.    She spent half an hour making herself presentable for the forthcoming  ordeal.    As a church clock struck eight, there came another tap on the door. It  was Mrs. Rennett again.    \"They are waiting,\" she said. Her face was a little pale and her lips  trembled.    Lydia, however, was calmness itself, as she walked into the drawing-room  ahead of her hostess.    There were four men. Glover and Rennett she knew. A third man wearing a  clerical collar she guessed was the officiating priest, and all her  attention was concentrated upon the fourth. He was a gaunt, unshaven  man, his hair cut short, his face and figure wasted, so that the clothes  he wore hung on him. Her first feeling was one of revulsion. Her second  was an impulse of pity. James Meredith, for she guessed it was he,  appeared wretchedly ill. He swung round as she came in, and looked at  her intently, then, walking quickly towards her, he held out his thin  hand.    \"Miss Beale, isn't it?\" he said. \"I'm sorry to meet you under such  unpleasant circumstances. Glover has explained everything, has he not?\"    She nodded.    His deep-set eyes had a magnetic quality that fascinated her.    \"You understand the terms? Glover has told you just why this marriage  must take place?\" he said, lowering his voice. \"Believe me, I am deeply  grateful to you for falling in with my wishes.\"    Without preliminary he walked over to where the parson stood.    \"We will begin now,\" he said simply.    The ceremony seemed so unreal to the girl that she did not realise what  it portended, not even when a ring (a loosely-fitting ring, for Jack  Glover had made the wildest guess at the size) was slipped over her  finger. She knelt to receive the solemn benediction and then got slowly  to her feet and looked at her husband strangely.    \"I think I'm going to faint,\" she said.    It was Jack Glover who caught her and carried her to the sofa. She woke  with a confused idea that somebody was trying to hypnotise her, and she  opened her eyes to look upon the sombre face of James Meredith.    \"Better?\" he asked anxiously. \"I'm afraid you've had a trying time, and  no sleep you said, Mrs. Rennett?\"    Mrs. Rennett shook her head.    \"Well, you'll sleep to-night better than I shall,\" he smiled, and then  he turned to Rennett, a grave and anxious man, who stood nervously  stroking his little beard, watching the bridegroom. \"Mr. Rennett,\" he  said, \"I must tell you in the presence of witnesses, that I have escaped  from a nursing home to which I had been sent by the clemency of the  Secretary of State. When I informed you that I had received permission  to come to your house this morning to get married, I told you that which  was not true.\"    \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" said Rennett politely. \"And, of course, it is  my duty to hand you over to the police, Mr. Meredith.\" It was all part  of the game. The girl watched the play, knowing that this scene was  carefully rehearsed, in order to absolve Rennett and his partner from  complicity in the escape.    Rennett had hardly spoken when there was a loud rat-tat at the front  door, and Jack Glover hastened into the hall to answer. But it was not  the policeman he had expected. It was a girl in a big sable coat,  muffled up to her eyes. She pushed past Jack, crossed the hall, and  walked straight into the drawing-room.    Lydia, standing shakily by Mrs. Rennett's side, saw the visitor come in,  and then, as she unfastened her coat, recognised her with a gasp. It  was the beautiful girl she had seen in the stalls of the theatre the  night before!    \"And what can we do for you?\" It was Glover's voice again, bland and  bantering.    \"I want Meredith,\" said the girl shortly, and Glover chuckled.    \"You have wanted Meredith for a long "]]]
