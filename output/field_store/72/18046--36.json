In  these cases it is best to spread out the sample, and taking equal  portions fairly at regular intervals, weigh into a Berlin dish 20 grams.  This should then be dried over a sand-bath, or if the ore is likely to  be injured by excess of heat, over a water-bath until the weight is  constant. The loss of weight multiplied by 5 gives the percentage of  water present.    Example:--      Weight of dish + wolfram      32.67 grms.      \"    \"  dish                12.67   \"                                  -----      \"    \"  wolfram             20.00   \"        \"    \"  dish + wolfram      32.67   \"      \"    \"    \"    dried        30.15   \"                                  -----      \"    \"  water                2.52   \"      2.52 × 5 = 12.6                        ~12.6%.~    There are other ores which are not apparently wet, but in the state  called \"air-dried.\" It is easier to take fair samples of these, and,  consequently, it is not necessary to use so large a quantity as 20  grams. But with a smaller quantity, extra precautions must be taken. All  dry solids at ordinary temperatures absorb moisture from the air. The  amount varies with the nature of the material and with the quantity of  surface exposed. Light bulky powders absorb more than heavy ones,  because of the greater condensing surface. It is on this account that it  is well to weigh substances, which have been dried, between  close-fitting watch-glasses. The method of determining moisture is to  weigh out into the glasses 5 grams of ore, and dry in the water-oven  until there is no further loss of weight. On taking the glasses out of  the oven, they should be at once closed, the clip put on, and after  cooling in a desiccator weighed. If after a second trial the loss is the  same, or only increased by a milligram, the determination is finished.    Example:--      Weight of glasses + pyrites                    31.0470 grms.      \"    \"  glasses                              26.0470   \"                                                   -------      \"    \"  pyrites                               5.0000   \"      \"    \"  glasses + pyrites, dried 1 hour      30.8965   \"      \"    \"    \"         \"      dried 1-1/2  \"    30.8957   \"      \"    \"    \"         \"                        31.0470   \"      \"    \"    \"         \"      dried             30.8957   \"                                                   -------      \"    \"  moisture                              0.1513   \"        0.1513 × 20 = 3.026                                   ~3.02%.~    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    Sometimes it may be advisable to dry 10 grams, in which case multiplying  the loss by 10 will give the percentage. The dried ore should be  transferred to a weighing-tube (fig. 3), and reserved for the subsequent  determinations. The weighing-tube with the ore must be marked, and kept  in a desiccator.    Most ores and inorganic substances can be dried, and their moisture  determined by the loss in this way. When, however, the substance  contains another somewhat volatile ingredient, it is exposed over  sulphuric acid in a desiccator for two days (if _in vacuo_, all the  better), and the loss determined. Moisture in dynamite should be  determined in this way.    When water is simply mechanically mixed with a substance it presents but  little difficulty. The combined water is a different matter. Slaked  lime, even when perfectly dry, contains much water; and if the water of  soda crystals were separated and frozen, it would occupy a volume equal  to that of the original crystals. Perfectly dry substances may contain  much water, and this combined water is retained by different materials  with very unequal vigour. Sodium sulphate and sodium phosphate crystals  lose water even when exposed under ordinary conditions to dry air. Soda  crystals when heated melt, and at a moderate temperature give off their  water with ebullition. The temperature at which all the water is given  up varies with each particular salt; the actual determination of the  water in each case will require somewhat different treatment. Such  determinations, however, are seldom required; and from a practical  point of view this combined water causes no trouble.    _In assaying ores_, we term \"moisture\" all water which is lost by  exposure in a water-oven at 100° C., and the \"dry ore\" is the ore which  has been dried at this temperature. No advantage, but rather endless  confusion, would be caused by varying the temperature with the object of  estimating the whole of the water which a hydrated salt may contain. The  results of the assay of the other components should be calculated on the  \"dry ore.\" One advantage of this is obvious:--The dry ore has a constant  composition, and the results of all assays of it will be the same, no  matter when made; the moisture, however, may vary from day to day, and  would be influenced by a passing shower of rain. It is well to limit  this variability to the moisture by considering it apart, and thus avoid  having the percentage, say, of copper rising and falling under the  influence of the weather.    In the case of certain salts, however, such as soda crystals and  hydrated sulphate of copper (when these constitute the bulk of the  substance to be assayed), it is as well to perform the assay on the  moist, or at any rate air-dried, substance.[2] It would be equally  convenient to calculate on the substance dried at 100° C.; but in this  case it would be well, in order to avoid a somewhat shallow criticism,  to replace the term \"moisture\" by the longer but equivalent phrase  \"water lost at 100° C.\"    ~Calculation and Statement of Results.~--By far the most generally  convenient method of stating the results of an assay is that of the  percentage or parts in a hundred, and to avoid a needlessly troublesome  calculation it is well to take such a quantity of ore for each assay as  by a simple multiplication will yield the percentage. In these  calculations decimals are freely employed, and students should make  themselves familiar with the methods of using them.    Other methods of statement are in use, and have advantages in certain  special cases. With bullion the parts in a thousand are given, and in  those cases in which the percentage is very small, as in water analysis,  it is convenient to report on parts in 100,000, or even on parts per  1,000,000. These are easily got from the corresponding percentages by  shifting the decimal point one, three, or four places to the right. Thus  92.5 per cent. is 925 per thousand; and 0.0036 per cent. is 3.6 per  100,000, or 36 per million.    With ores of tin, silver, and gold, the result is stated as so many  cwts., lbs., or ozs., in the ton. With dressed tin ores as they are  sent to the smelter, the produce is given in cwts. and quarters to the  ton. The corresponding percentage may be obtained by multiplying by  five; or, inversely, if the percentage is given, the produce may be got  by dividing by five. A produce of 13-1/2 equals a percentage of 13.5×5  = 67.5; and a percentage of 70.0 equals a produce of 70/5 = 14. With  tin ores as raised (in which the percentage is small) the reduction must  be carried to pounds per ton. One per cent. equals 22.4 lbs. to the ton;  consequently, if we multiply the percentage by 22.4, the produce will be  given. Thus, if an ore contains 6.7 per cent. of oxide of tin, the  produce is 6.7×22.4 = 150 lbs. (or 1 cwt., 1 quarter, and 10 lbs.) to  the ton. With gold and silver ores, the proportion of precious metal is  small, and it is necessary to carry the reduction to ozs. and dwts. to  the ton; and since gold and silver are sold by troy weight, whilst the  ton is avoirdupois, it is of importance to remember that the ounces in  the two systems are not the same. A ton contains 15,680,000 grains,  which equal 653,333.3 dwts. or 32,666.6 ozs. (troy). The following rules  are useful:--      To get ozs. (troy) per ton, multiply parts per 100,000 by 0.327;    To get dwts. per ton, multiply parts per 100,000 by 6.53;    To get grains per ton, multiply parts per 100,000 by 156.8.    Where liquids are being assayed, cubic centimetres are held to be  equivalent to grams, and the usual method of statement is, \"so many  parts by weight in so many by measure.\" Where the statement is made as  grams per litre or grains per gallon, there can be no doubt as to what  is meant; and even if it be expressed in parts per 100,000, parts by  weight in a measured volume must be understood unless the contrary is  expressly stated.    In some cases, where the density of the solution differs greatly from  that of water, the percentage by weight may be given; and in others,  mixtures of two or more liquids, the percentages may be given by volume  or by weight; as so many c.c. in 100 c.c., or as so many grams in 100  grams, or even as so many grams in 100 c.c. In such cases it must be  distinctly shown which method of statement is adopted.    One grain per gallon means 1 grain in 70,000 grain-measures, or one part  in 70,000. Dividing by 7 and multiplying by 10 will convert grains per  gallon into parts per 100,000. Inversely, dividing by 10 and multiplying  by 7, will convert parts per 100,000 into grains per gallon.    Grams per litre are parts per 1000; multiplying by 100 will give parts  per 100,000, and multiplying by 70 will give grains per gallon.    Among foreign systems of weights, the French is by far the best.  Kilograms (2.205 lbs.) per quintal (220.5 lbs.) are parts per cent.; and  grams (15.43 grs.) per quintal are parts per 100,000. From the rule  already given, grams per quintal may be converted into ounces to the ton  by multiplying by 0.327.    The German loths per centner (1/2 oz. (avoirdupois) to 100 lbs.) equal  parts per 3200; they are converted into parts per cent. by dividing by  32, or into ounces (troy) per ton by multiplying by 10.208.    In the United States, as a sort of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18755"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part II-II (Secunda Secundae) (#4)"],[1,"simply, for the reason that science demands that its object should be  deemed impossible to be otherwise, whereas it is essential to  opinion, that its object should be deemed possible to be otherwise.  Yet that which is the object of faith, on account of the certainty of  faith, is also deemed impossible to be otherwise; and the reason why  science and faith cannot be about the same object and in the same  respect is because the object of science is something seen whereas  the object of faith is the unseen, as stated above.  _______________________    SIXTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 6]    Whether Those Things That Are of Faith Should Be Divided into Certain  Articles?    Objection 1: It would seem that those things that are of faith should  not be divided into certain articles. For all things contained in  Holy Writ are matters of faith. But these, by reason of their  multitude, cannot be reduced to a certain number. Therefore it seems  superfluous to distinguish certain articles of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, material differences can be multiplied indefinitely,  and therefore art should take no notice of them. Now the formal  aspect of the object of faith is one and indivisible, as stated above  (A. 1), viz. the First Truth, so that matters of faith cannot be  distinguished in respect of their formal object. Therefore no notice  should be taken of a material division of matters of faith into  articles.    Obj. 3: Further, it has been said by some [*Cf. William of Auxerre,  Summa Aurea] that \"an article is an indivisible truth concerning God,  exacting [arctans] our belief.\" Now belief is a voluntary act, since,  as Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), \"no man believes against  his will.\" Therefore it seems that matters of faith should not be  divided into articles.    _On the contrary,_ Isidore says: \"An article is a glimpse of Divine  truth, tending thereto.\" Now we can only get a glimpse of Divine truth  by way of analysis, since things which in God are one, are manifold in  our intellect. Therefore matters of faith should be divided into  articles.    _I answer that,_ the word \"article\" is apparently derived from the  Greek; for the Greek _arthron_ [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea]  which the Latin renders \"articulus,\" signifies a fitting together of  distinct parts: wherefore the small parts of the body which fit  together are called the articulations of the limbs. Likewise, in the  Greek grammar, articles are parts of speech which are affixed to  words to show their gender, number or case. Again in rhetoric,  articles are parts that fit together in a sentence, for Tully says  (Rhet. iv) that an article is composed of words each pronounced  singly and separately, thus: \"Your passion, your voice, your look,  have struck terror into your foes.\"    Hence matters of Christian faith are said to contain distinct  articles, in so far as they are divided into parts, and fit together.  Now the object of faith is something unseen in connection with God, as  stated above (A. 4). Consequently any matter that, for a special  reason, is unseen, is a special article; whereas when several matters  are known or not known, under the same aspect, we are not to  distinguish various articles. Thus one encounters one difficulty in  seeing that God suffered, and another in seeing that He rose again  from the dead, wherefore the article of the Resurrection is distinct  from the article of the Passion. But that He suffered, died and was  buried, present the same difficulty, so that if one be accepted, it is  not difficult to accept the others; wherefore all these belong to one  article.    Reply Obj. 1: Some things are proposed to our belief are in  themselves of faith, while others are of faith, not in themselves but  only in relation to others: even as in sciences certain propositions  are put forward on their own account, while others are put forward in  order to manifest others. Now, since the chief object of faith  consists in those things which we hope to see, according to Heb.  11:2: \"Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for,\" it follows  that those things are in themselves of faith, which order us directly  to eternal life. Such are the Trinity of Persons in Almighty God  [*The Leonine Edition reads: The Three Persons, the omnipotence of  God, etc.], the mystery of Christ's Incarnation, and the like: and  these are distinct articles of faith. On the other hand certain  things in Holy Writ are proposed to our belief, not chiefly on their  own account, but for the manifestation of those mentioned above: for  instance, that Abraham had two sons, that a dead man rose again at  the touch of Eliseus' bones, and the like, which are related in Holy  Writ for the purpose of manifesting the Divine mystery or the  Incarnation of Christ: and such things should not form distinct  articles.    Reply Obj. 2: The formal aspect of the object of faith can be taken  in two ways: first, on the part of the thing believed, and thus there  is one formal aspect of all matters of faith, viz. the First Truth:  and from this point of view there is no distinction of articles.  Secondly, the formal aspect of matters of faith, can be considered  from our point of view; and thus the formal aspect of a matter of  faith is that it is something unseen; and from this point of view  there are various distinct articles of faith, as we saw above.    Reply Obj. 3: This definition of an article is taken from an  etymology of the word as derived from the Latin, rather than in  accordance with its real meaning, as derived from the Greek: hence it  does not carry much weight. Yet even then it could be said that  although faith is exacted of no man by a necessity of coercion, since  belief is a voluntary act, yet it is exacted of him by a necessity of  end, since \"he that cometh to God must believe that He is,\" and  \"without faith it is impossible to please God,\" as the Apostle  declares (Heb. 11:6).  _______________________    SEVENTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 7]    Whether the Articles of Faith Have Increased in Course of Time?    Objection 1: It would seem that the articles of faith have not  increased in course of time. Because, as the Apostle says (Heb.  11:1), \"faith is the substance of things to be hoped for.\" Now the  same things are to be hoped for at all times. Therefore, at all  times, the same things are to be believed.    Obj. 2: Further, development has taken place, in sciences devised  by man, on account of the lack of knowledge in those who discovered  them, as the Philosopher observes (Metaph. ii). Now the doctrine of  faith was not devised by man, but was delivered to us by God, as  stated in Eph. 2:8: \"It is the gift of God.\" Since then there can be  no lack of knowledge in God, it seems that knowledge of matters of  faith was perfect from the beginning and did not increase as time  went on.    Obj. 3: Further, the operation of grace proceeds in orderly fashion  no less than the operation of nature. Now nature always makes a  beginning with perfect things, as Boethius states (De Consol. iii).  Therefore it seems that the operation of grace also began with  perfect things, so that those who were the first to deliver the  faith, knew it most perfectly.    Obj. 4: Further, just as the faith of Christ was delivered to us  through the apostles, so too, in the Old Testament, the knowledge of  faith was delivered by the early fathers to those who came later,  according to Deut. 32:7: \"Ask thy father, and he will declare to  thee.\" Now the apostles were most fully instructed about the  mysteries, for \"they received them more fully than others, even as  they received them earlier,\" as a gloss says on Rom. 8:23: \"Ourselves  also who have the first fruits of the Spirit.\" Therefore it seems  that knowledge of matters of faith has not increased as time went on.    _On the contrary,_ Gregory says (Hom. xvi in Ezech.) that \"the  knowledge of the holy fathers increased as time went on . . . and the  nearer they were to Our Savior's coming, the more fully did they  receive the mysteries of salvation.\"    _I answer that,_ The articles of faith stand in the same relation to  the doctrine of faith, as self-evident principles to a teaching based  on natural reason. Among these principles there is a certain order,  so that some are contained implicitly in others; thus all principles  are reduced, as to their first principle, to this one: \"The same  thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time,\" as the  Philosopher states (Metaph. iv, text. 9). In like manner all the  articles are contained implicitly in certain primary matters of  faith, such as God's existence, and His providence over the salvation  of man, according to Heb. 11: \"He that cometh to God, must believe  that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him.\" For the  existence of God includes all that we believe to exist in God  eternally, and in these our happiness consists; while belief in His  providence includes all those things which God dispenses in time, for  man's salvation, and which are the way to that happiness: and in this  way, again, some of those articles which follow from these are  contained in others: thus faith in the Redemption of mankind includes  belief in the Incarnation of Christ, His Passion and so forth.    Accordingly we must conclude that, as regards the substance of the  articles of faith, they have not received any increase as time went  on: since whatever those who lived later have believed, was  contained, albeit implicitly, in the faith of those Fathers who  preceded them. But there was an increase in the number of articles  believed explicitly, since to those who lived in later times some  were known explicitly which were not known explicitly by those who  lived before them. Hence the Lord said to Moses (Ex. 6:2, 3): \"I am  the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob [*Vulg.: 'I am  the Lord that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac,"]]]
