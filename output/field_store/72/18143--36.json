He took a considerable part in the negotiations of  the twelve years' truce in 1606.  His conduct of affairs having  displeased the French king, he was recalled from his post by  Oldenbarneveldt in 1616.  Such was the hatred he henceforth  conceived against his former benefactor, that he did his  very utmost to effect his ruin.  He was one of the packed  court of judges who in 1619 condemned the aged statesman to  death.  For his share in this judicial murder a deep stain  rests on the memory of Aarssens.  He afterwards became the  confidential counsellor of Maurice, prince of Orange, and  afterwards of Frederick Henry, prince of Orange, in their  conduct of the foreign affairs of the republic.  He was sent  on special embassies to Venice, Germany and England, and  displayed so much diplomatic skill and finesse that Richelieu  ranked him among the three greatest politicians of his time.    AASEN, IVAR (1813-1896), Norwegian philologist and  lexicographer, was born at Aasen i Orsten, in Sondmore,  Norway, on the. 5th of August 1813.  His father, a small  peasant-farmer named Ivar Jonsson, died in 1826.  He was  brought up to farmwork, but he assiduously cultivated all  his leisure in reading, and when he was eighteen he opened an  elementary school in his native parish.  In 1833 he entered  the household of H. C. Thoresen the husband of the eminent  writer Magdalene Thoresen, in Hero, and here he picked up  the elements of Latin.  Gradually, and by dint of infinite  patience and concentration, the young peasant became master  of many languages, and began the scientific study of their  structure.  About 1841 he had freed himself from all the  burden of manual labour, and could occupy his thoughts with  the dialect of his native district, the Sondmore; his  first publication was a small collection of folk-songs in  the Sondmore language (1843) . His remarkable abilities now  attracted general attention, and he was helped to continue his  studies undisturbed.  His Grammar ofthe Norwegian Dialects  (1848) was the result of much labour, and of journeys taken  to every part of the country.  Aasen's famous Dictionary  of the Norwegian Dialects appeared in its original form in  1850, and from this publication dates all the wide cultivation  of the popular language in Norwegian, since Aasen really did  no less than construct, out of the different materials at his  disposal, a popular language or definite folke-maal for  Norway.  With certain modifications, the most important of which  were introduced later by Aasen himself, this artificial language  is that which has been adopted ever since by those who write in  dialect, and which later enthusiasts have once more endeavoured  to foist upon Norway as her official language in the place of  Dano-Norwegian.  Aasen composed poems and plays in the composite  dialect to show how it should be used; one of these dramas,  The Heir (1855), was frequently acted, and may be considered  as the pioneer of all the abundant dialect-literature of the  last half-century, from Vinje down to Garborg.  Aasen continued  to enlarge and improve his grammars and his dictionary.  He  lived very quietly in lodgings in Christiania, surrounded by  his books and shrinking from publicity, but his name grew into  wide political favour as his ideas about the language of the  peasants became more and more the watch-word of the popular  party.  Quite early in his career, 1842, he had begun to  receive a stipend to enable him to give his entire attention  to his philological investigations; and the Storthing--.  conscious of the national importance of his woth---treated hm  in this respect with more and more generosity as he advanced in  years.  He continued his investigations to the last, but it  may be said that, after the 1873 edition of his Dictionary,  he added but little to his stores.  Ivar Aasen holds perhaps  an isolated place in literary history as the one man who has  invented, or at least selected and constructed, a language  which has pleased so many thousands of his countrymen that  they have accepted it for their schools, their sermons  and their songs.  He died in Christiania on the 23rd of  September 1896, and was buried with Public honours. (E. G.)    AB, the fifth month of the ecclesiastical and the  eleventh of the civil year of the Jews.  It approximately  Corresponds to the period of the 15th of July to the 15th of  August.  The word is of Babylonian origin, adopted by the  Jews with other calendar names after the Babylonian exile.  Tradition ascribes the death of Aaron to the first day of Ab.  On the ninth is kept the Fast of Ab, or the Black Fast, to  bewail the destruction of the first temple by Nebuchadrezzar  (586 B.C.) and of the second by Titus (A.D. 70).    ABA. (1) A form of altazimuth instrument, invented by, and Cabled  after, Antoine d'Abbadie; (2) a rough homespun manufactured in  Bulgariai (3) a long coarse shirt worn by the Bedouin Arabs.    ABABDA (the Gebadei of Pliny, probably the Troglodytes of  classical writers), a nomad tribe of African ``Arabs,, of Hamitic  origin.  They extend from the Nile at Assuan to the Red Sea,  and reach northward to the Kena-Kosseir road, thus occupying  the southern border of Egypt east of the Nile.  They call  themselves ``sons of the Jinns.'' With some of the clans of  the Bisharin (q.v.) and possibly the Hadendoa (q.v.) they  represent the Blemmyes of classic geographers, and their location  to-day is almost identical with that assigned them in Roman  times.  They were constantly at war with the Romans, who at  last subsidized them.  In the middle ages they were known as  Beja (q.v.), and convoyed pilgrims from the Nile valley to  Aidhab, the port of embarkation for Jedda.  From time immemorial  they have acted as guides to caravans through the Nubian  desert and up the Nile valley as far as Sennar.  To-day many of  them are employed in the telegraph service across the Arabian  desert.  They intermarried with the Nuba, and settled in small  Colonies at Shendi and elsewhere long before the Egyptian  invasion (A.D. 1820-1822).  They are still great trade  carriers, and visit very distant districts.  The Ababda of  Egypt, numbering some 30,000, are governed by an hereditary  ``chief.'' Although nominally a vassal of the Khedive he pays no  tribute.  Indeed he is paid a subsidy, a portion of the  road-dues, in return for his safeguarding travellers from Bedouin  robbers.  The sub-sheikhs are directly responsible to him.  The Ababda of Nubia, reported by Joseph von Russegger, who  visited the country in 1836, to number some 40,000, have since  diminished, having probably amalgamated with the Bisharin,  their hereditary enemies when they were themselves a powerful  nation.  The Ababda generally speak Arabic (mingled with  Barabra [Nubian] words), the result of their long-continued  contact with Egypt; but the southern and south-eastern portion  of the tribe in many cases still retain their Beja dialect,  ToBedawiet.  Those of Kosseir will not speak this before  strangers, as they believe that to reveal the mysterious  dialect would bring ruin on them.  Those nearest the Nile  have much fellah blood in them.  As a tribe they claim an Arab  origin, apparently through their sheikhs.  They have adopted  the dress and habits of the fellahin, unlike their kinsmen  the Bisharin and Hadendoa, who go practically naked.  They  are neither so fierce nor of so fine a physique as these  latter.  They are lithe and well built, but small: the average  height is little more than 5 ft., except in the sheikh clan,  who are obviously of Arab origin.  Their complexion is more  red than black, their features angular, noses straight and hair  luxuriant.  They bear the character of being treacherous and  faithless, being bound by no oath, but they appear to be honest  in money matters and hospitable, and, however poor, never  beg.  Formerly very poor, the Ababda became wealthy after  the British occupation of Egypt.  The chief settlements are in  Nubia, where they live in villages and employ themselves in  agriculture.  Others of them fish in the Red Sea and then  hawk the salt fish in the interior.  Others are pedlars,  while charcoal burning, wood-gathering and trading in gums  and drugs, especially in senna leaves, occupy many.  Unlike  the true Arab, the Ababda do not live in tents, but build  huts with hurdles and mats, or live in natural caves, as  did their ancestors in classic times.  They have few horses,  using the camel as beast of burden or their ``mount'' in  war.  They live chiefly on milk and durra, the latter  eaten either raw or roasted.  They are very superstitious,  believing, for example, that evil would overtake a family  if a girl member should, after her marriage, ever set eyes  on her mother: hence the Ababda husband has to make his  home far from his wife's village.  In the Mahdist troubles  (1882-1898) many ``friendlies'' were recruited from the tribe.

Perhaps not!    If that giant of modern Ireland, the pacificator citizen king, succeeded  in separating the island from Great Britain, would he, on attaining the  throne, or the dictatorship, or the presidency, or whatever it might be,  for the nonce, desire pure democracy? _Je crois que non_, because, if he  did, he would reign about one clear week afterwards.    Look at the United States, see how each successive president is bowed  down before the Moloch altar; he must worship the democratic Baal, if he  desires to be elected, or re-elected. It is not the intellect, or the  wealth of the Union that rules. Already they seriously canvass in the  Empire State perfect equality in worldly substance, and the division of  the lands into small portions, sufficient to afford the means of  respectable existence to every citizen. It is, perhaps, fortunate that  very few of the office-holders have much substance to spare under these  circumstances; but, if the President, Vice-President, and the  Secretaries of State, are to live upon an acre or two of land for the  rest of their lives, Spartan broth will be indeed a rich diet to theirs.    When the sympathizers invaded Canada, in 1838-1839, the lands of the  Canadians were thus parcelled out amongst them, as the reward of their  extremely patriotic services, but in slices of one hundred, instead of  one or two, acres.    But, notwithstanding all this ultra-democracy, there is at present a  sufficient counterbalance in the sense of the people, to prevent any  very serious consequences; and the Irish, from having had their religion  trampled upon, and themselves despised, would be very likely to run  counter to native feeling.    If any country in the whole civilized world exhibits the inequality of  classes more forcibly than another, it is the country which has lately  annexed Texas, and which aims at annexing all the New World.    There is a more marked line drawn between wealth and pretension on the  one hand, poverty and impertinent assumption on the other, than in the  dominions of the Czar. Birth, place, power, are all duly honoured, and  that sometimes to a degree which would astonish a British nobleman,  accustomed all his life to high society. I remember once travelling in a  canal boat, the most abominable of all conveyances, resembling Noah's  ark in more particulars than its shape, that I was accosted, in the  Northern States too, and near the borders, where equality and liberty  reign paramount, by a long slab-sided fellow-passenger, who, I thought,  was going to ask me to pay his passage, his appearance was so shabby,  with the following questions:    \"Where are you from? are you a Livingstone?\" I told him, for I like to  converse with characters, that I was from Canada. \"What's your name?\" he  asked. I satisfied him. He examined me from head to foot with attention,  and, as he was an elderly man, I stood the gaze most valiantly. \"Well,\"  he said, \"I thought you were a Livingstone; you have got small ears, and  small feet and hands, and that, all the world over, is the sign of  gentle blood.\"    He was afterwards very civil; and, upon inquiring of the skipper of the  boat who he was, I found that my friend was a man of large fortune, who  lived somewhere near Utica, on an estate of his own.    This was before the sympathy troubles, and I can back it with another  story or two to amuse the reader.    Some years ago, when it was the fashion in Canada for British officers  always to travel in uniform, I went to Buffalo, the great city of  Buffalo on lake Erie, in the Thames steamer, commanded by my good  friend, Captain Van Allen, and the first British Canadian steamboat  that ever entered that harbour. We went in gallantly, with the flag  flying that \"has braved a thousand years the battle and the breeze.\" I  think the majority of the population must have lined the wharfs to see  us come in. They rent the welkin with welcomes, and, among other  demonstrations, cast up their caps, and cried with might and main--\"Long  live George the Third!\"--Our gracious monarch had for years before bid  this world good night, but that was nothing; the good folks of Buffalo  had not perhaps quite forgotten that they were once, long before their  city was a city, subjects of King George.    I and another officer in uniform were received with all honours, and  escorted to the Eagle hotel, where we were treated sumptuously, and had  to run the gauntlet of handshaking to great extent. A respectable  gentleman, about forty, some seven years older than myself, stuck close  to me all the while. I thought he admired the British undress uniform,  but he only wanted to ask questions, and, after sundry answers, he  inquired my name, which being courteously communicated, he said, \"Well,  I am glad, that's a fact, that I have seen you, for many is the whipping  I have had for your book of Algebra.\" Now I never was capable of  committing such an unheard-of enormity as being the cause of  flagellation to any man by simple or quadratic equations; and it must  have been the binomial theorem which had tickled his catastrophe, for it  was my father's treatise which had penetrated into the new world of  Buffalonian education.    It is a pity, is it not, gentle reader, that such feelings do not now  exist?    Nevertheless, even now, the designation of a British officer is a  passport in any part of the United States. The custom-house receives it  with courtesy and good-will; society is gratified by attentions received  from a British officer; and it is coupled with the feelings which the  habits and conduct of a gentleman engender throughout Christendom.    At New York, I visited every place worth seeing; and, although  disliking gambling, races, and debating societies, _a outrance_, I was  determined to judge for myself of New York, of life in New York.    On one occasion, I was at a meeting of the turf in an hotel after the  races, where violent discussions and heavy champagning were going on. I  was then (it was in 1837) a major in the army, and was introduced to one  or two prominent men in the room as a British officer who had been to  see the racecourse; this caused a general stir, and the champagne flew  about like----I am at a loss for a simile; and the health of Queen  Victoria was drunk with three times three.    On board a packet returning from England, we had several of the leading  characters of the United States as passengers. A very silly and  troublesome democrat, of the Loco-foco school, from Philadelphia, made  himself conspicuous always after dinner, when we sat, according to  English fashion, at a dessert, by his vituperations against monarchy and  an exhibition of his excessive love for everything American. The  gentlemen above alluded to, men who had travelled over Europe, whose  education and manners made them that which a true gentleman is all over  the world, were disgusted, and, to punish his impertinence, proposed  that a weekly paper should be written by the cabin passengers, in which  the occurrences of each day should be noted and commented upon, and that  poetry, tales, and essays, should form part of its matter.    They agreed to discuss the relative points and bearings of monarchy and  democracy; they to depute one of their number to be the champion of  monarchy; and we to chuse the champion of democracy from amongst the  English passengers.    Two drawings were fixed up at each end of the table after dinner; one,  representing a crowned Plum-pudding; and the other, Liberty and  Equality, by the well-known sign. The blustering animal was soon  effectually silenced; a host of first-rate talent levelled a constant  battery at his rude and uncultivated mind.    I shall never forget this voyage, and I hope the talent-gifted Canadian  lawyer who threw down the gauntlet of Republicanism, and who has since  risen to the highest honours of his profession which the Queen can  bestow, has preserved copies of the Saturday's Gazette of The Mediator  American Packet-ship.    The mention of this vessel puts me in mind of one more American  anecdote, and I must tell it, for I have a good deal of dry work before  me.    Crossing the Atlantic once in an American vessel, we met another  American ship, of the same size, and passed very close. Our captain  displayed the stars and stripes in true ship-shape cordial greeting.  Brother Jonathan took no notice of this sea civility, and passed on;  upon which the skipper, after taking a long look at him with his  spy-glass, broke out in a passion, \"What!\" said he, \"you won't show your  b--d bunting, your old stripy rag? Now, I guess, if he had been a  Britisher, instead of a d--d Yankee, he would not have been ashamed of  his flag; he would have acted like a gentleman. Phew!\" and he whistled,  and then chewed his cigar viciously, quite unconscious that I was  enjoying the scene.    But, if it be possible that one peculiar portion of the old countrymen  are more disliked or despised than another in any country under the sun,  connected by such ties as the United States are with Britain, there can  be no doubt that the condition of the Jews under King John, as far as  hatred and unexpressed contumelious feeling goes, was preferable to the  feeling which native Americans, of the ultra Loco-foco or ultra-federal  breed, entertain towards the labouring Catholic Irish, and would, if  they could with safety, vent upon them in dreadful visitation. They  would exterminate them, if they dared.    To account for such a feeling, it must be observed that a large portion  of these ignorant and misguided men have brought much of this animosity  upon themselves; for, continuing in the New World that barbarous  tendency to demolish all systems and all laws opposed to their limited  notions of right and wrong,"]]]
