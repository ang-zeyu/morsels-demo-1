The two German explorers have also discovered the site and even the  ruins of Muzazir, called Ardinis by the people of Van. They lie on the  hill of Shkenna, near Topsana, on the road between Kelishin and Sidek.  In the immediate neighbourhood the travellers succeeded in deciphering  a monument of Rusas I., partly in Vannic, partly in Assyrian, from which  it appears that the Vannic king did not, after all, commit suicide when  the news of the fall of Muzazir was brought to him, as is stated by  Sargon, but that, on the contrary, he \"marched against the mountains  of Assyria\" and restored the fallen city itself. Urzana, the King of  Muzazir, had fled to him for shelter, and after the departure of the  Assyrian army he was sent back by Rusas to his ancestral domains. The  whole of the district in which Muzazir was situated was termed Lulu, and  was regarded as the southern province of Ararat. In it was Mount Nizir,  on whose summit the ark of the Chaldsean Noah rested, and which is  therefore rightly described in the Book of Genesis as one of \"the  mountains of Ararat.\" It was probably the Rowandiz of to-day.    The discoveries made by Drs. Belck and Lehmann, however, have not been  confined to Vannic texts. At the sources of the Tigris Dr. Lehmann has  found two Assyrian inscriptions of the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser IL,  one dated in his fifteenth and the other in his thirty-first year, and  relating to his campaigns against Aram of Ararat. He has further found  that the two inscriptions previously known to exist at the same spot,  and believed to belong to Tiglath-Ninip and Assur-nazir-pal, are really  those of Shalmaneser II., and refer to the war of his seventh year.    But it is from Egypt that the most revolutionary revelations have  come. At Abydos and Kom el-Ahmar, opposite El-Kab, monuments have been  disinterred of the kings of the first and second dynasties, if not of  even earlier princes; while at Negada, north of Thebes, M. de Morgan has  found a tomb which seems to have been that of Menes himself. A new world  of art has been opened out before us; even the hieroglyphic system of  writing is as yet immature and strange. But the art is already advanced  in many respects; hard stone was cut into vases and bowls, and even  into statuary of considerable artistic excellence; glazed porcelain was  already made, and bronze, or rather copper, was fashioned into weapons  and tools. The writing material, as in Babylonia, was often clay,  over which seal-cylinders of a Babylonian pattern were rolled. Equally  Babylonian are the strange and composite animals engraved on some of the  objects of this early age, as well as the structure of the tombs, which  were built, not of stone, but of crude brick, with their external  walls panelled and pilastered. Professor Hommel's theory, which brings  Egyptian civilisation from Babylonia along with the ancestors of the  historical Egyptians, has thus been largely verified.    But the historical Egyptians were not the first inhabitants of the  valley of the Nile. Not only have palaeolithic implements been found on  the plateau of the desert; the relics of neolithic man have turned up  in extraordinary abundance. When the historical Egyptians arrived with  their copper weapons and their system of writing, the land was already  occupied by a pastoral people, who had attained a high level of  neolithic culture. Their implements of flint are the most beautiful and  delicately finished that have ever been discovered; they were able to  carve vases of great artistic excellence out of the hardest of stone,  and their pottery was of no mean quality. Long after the country had  come into the possession of the historical dynasties, and had even been  united into a single monarchy, their settlements continued to exist  on the outskirts of the desert, and the neolithic culture that  distinguished them passed only gradually away. By degrees, however,  they intermingled with their conquerors from Asia, and thus formed the  Egyptian race of a later day. But they had already made Egypt what it  has been throughout the historical period. Under the direction of the  Asiatic immigrants and of the eugineering science whose first home had  been in the alluvial plain of Babylonia, they accomplished those great  works of irrigation which confined the Nile to its present channel,  which cleared away the jungle and the swamp that had formerly bordered  the desert, and turned them into fertile fields. Theirs were the hands  which carried out the plans of their more intelligent masters, and  cultivated the valley when once it had been reclaimed. The Egypt  of history was the creation of a twofold race: the Egyptians of the  monuments supplied the controlling and directing power; the Egyptians of  the neolithic graves bestowed upon it their labour and their skill.    The period treated of by Professor Maspero in these volumes is one for  which there is an abundance of materials sucli as do not exist for  the earlier portions of his history. The evidence of the monuments is  supplemented by that of the Hebrew and classical writers. But on this  very account it is in some respects more difficult to deal with, and the  conclusions arrived at by the historian are more open to question and  dispute. In some cases conflicting accounts are given of an event which  seem to rest on equally good authority; in other cases, there is a  sudden failure of materials just where the thread of the story becomes  most complicated. Of this the decline and fall of the Assyrian empire  is a prominent example; for our knowledge of it, we have still to depend  chiefly on the untrustworthy legends of the Greeks. Our views must be  coloured more or less by our estimate of Herodotos; those who, like  myself, place little or no confidence in what he tells us about Oriental  affairs will naturally form a very different idea of the death-struggle,  of Assyria from that formed by writers who still see in him the Father  of Oriental History.    Even where the native monuments have come to our aid, they have not  unfrequently introduced difficulties and doubts where none seemed to  exist before, and have made the task of the critical historian harder  than ever. Cyrus and his forefathers, for instance, turn out to have  been kings of Anzan, and not of Persia, thus explaining why it is that  the Neo-Susian language appears by the side of the Persian and the  Babylonian as one of the three official languages of the Persian empire;  but we still have to learn what was the relation of Anzan to Persia on  the one hand, and to Susa on the other, and when it was that Cyrus of  Anzan became also King of Persia. In the Annalistic Tablet, he is called  \"King of Persia\" for the first time in the ninth year of Nabonidos.    Similar questions arise as to the position and nationality of Astyages.  He is called in the inscriptions, not a Mede, but a Manda--a name which,  as I showed many years ago, meant for the Babylonian a \"barbarian\" of  Kurdistan. I have myself little doubt that the Manda over whom Astyages  ruled were the Scythians of classical tradition, who, as may be gathered  from a text published by Mr. Strong, had occupied the ancient kingdom of  Ellipi. It is even possible that in the Madyes of Herodotos, we have a  reminiscence of the Manda of the cuneiform inscriptions. That the Greek  writers should have confounded the Mada or Medes with the Manda or  Barbarians is not surprising; we find even Berossos describing one of  the early dynasties of Babylonia as \"Median\" where Manda, and not  Mada, must plainly be meant.    These and similar problems, however, will doubtless be cleared up by the  progress of excavation and research. Perhaps M. de Morgan's excavations  at Susa may throw some light on them, but it is to the work of the  German expedition, which has recently begun the systematic exploration  of the site of Babylon, that we must chiefly look for help. The Babylon  of Nabopolassar and Nebuchadrezzar rose on the ruins of Nineveh, and  the story of downfall of the Assyrian empire must still be lying buried  under its mounds.    A. H. SAYCE.          TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE    In completing the translation of this great work, I have to thank  Professor Maspero for kindly permitting me to appeal to him on various  questions which arose while preparing the translation. His patience and  courtesy have alike been unfailing in every matter submitted for his  decision.    I am indebted to Miss Bradbury for kindly supplying, in the midst of  much other literary work for the Egypt Exploration Fund, the translation  of the chapter on the gods, and also of the earlier parts of some of the  first chapters. She has, moreover, helped me in my own share of the work  with many suggestions and hints, which her intimate connection with the  late Miss Amelia B. Edwards fully qualified her to give.    As in the original there is a lack of uniformity in the transcription  and accentuation of Arabic names, I have ventured to alter them in  several cases to the form most familiar to English readers.    The spelling of the ancient Egyptian words has, at Professor Maspero's  request, been retained throughout, with the exception that the French  _ou_ has been invariably represented by u, e.g. Khnoumou by Khnumu.    By an act of international courtesy, the director of the _Imprimerie  Nationale_ has allowed the beautifully cut hieroglyphic and cuneiform  type used in the original to be employed in the English edition, and  I take advantage of this opportunity to express to him our thanks and  appreciation of his graceful act.

CONTENTS    CHAPTER I.--THE NILE AND EGYPT The River and its Influence upon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19406"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXXVI., No. 8, February 24, 1877 (#4)"],[1,"of two lost arts, the secrets of which the modern world, with all its  infinitely superior wisdom, has not yet rediscovered.    The productions, in the Castellani collection, of precious metal  workers dating from prehistoric epochs, the exact dates of which are  wholly unknown, and covering the long period ending in the thirteenth  century, are represented by the contents of some twenty cases. The  first three of these receptacles bear no dates. The ornaments which  they contain are of bronze, amber, silver, and glass (the latter  having become converted into opalescent silicic acid), and were found  in Praeneste (modern Palestrina, Italy), and in the territory which was  ancient Etruria. Case No. 4 bears date 700 B.C., and here is a rich  treasure of primitive Etruscan and Phoenician ornaments of gold,  adorned with granulated work. Signor Castellani considers that the  workmanship of these objects is so perfect that it is impossible at  the present time to explain the process of execution, and very  difficult to imitate it. The ornaments are of two kinds--those for  ordinary use and those for funereal purposes. The first are massive,  and might be worn for years without injury; the others are extremely  delicate. All are made of the purest gold, and their decoration  evinces the most consummate skill and taste on the part of the artist.  There is, for example, a small flask, shaped something like an antique  wine jar, and about five inches in height. It is of beaten gold, and  is covered with a pattern intended to imitate the similarly shaped  designs of variegated glass of the Graeco-Phoenician period. This  pattern is entirely produced by minute globules of metal soldered to  the surface in tiers of zigzag or Vandyke patterns. Another specimen  is a strip of gold covered with granulated lines and bearing a row of  birds in relief. On other ornaments are exquisitely carved heads and  flowers, produced apparently by hammering on the reverse of the  object, but with a delicacy and precision of touch which is simply  marvelous.    The closest students of this ancient handiwork are entirely at a loss  to understand how the processes of melting, soldering, and wire  drawing, which were employed in the art, were performed. Modern  workmen have failed in their attempts exactly to imitate the old  ornaments; and it is certain that the secret of the mechanical agents,  whereby it was possible to separate and join pieces of gold hardly  perceptible to the naked eye, is lost. Signor Castellani has taken  great pains to solve the problem, reading all the treatises of  mediaeval goldsmiths, inquiring of all classes of Italian jewelers, and  experimenting with all kinds of chemicals, in the hope of finding the  solder wherewith the minute grains were attached to the surface of the  metal. At last he found some of the old processes still employed in a  remote district, hidden in the recesses of the Apennines, far from the  great towns. Bringing away a few workmen, he gave them much more  instruction, and at last succeeded, not perhaps in equalling, but  certainly in rivalling the ancient productions.    We question whether the Etruscans used fire at all in their soldering,  as it would be almost an impossibility to keep the excessively fine  tools necessary for the work at a proper heat. Mr. Joshua Rose offers  the plausible suggestion that a cold flux was employed, with which the  workman followed the lines or dots of his pattern. Then the gold  granules were possibly sprinkled over the surface, and adhered only to  the solder, the superfluous grains being brushed off after the solder  had set.    There is also a fragment of a finely woven fabric, made of threads of  pure gold, found on the body of a woman in a tomb at Metapontum. This  is without doubt the material to which the Psalmist refers in speaking  of \"the King's daughter\" having \"clothing of wrought gold;\" and in the  Pentateuch there is reference to gold threads being used upon looms.    As we follow the various objects in the twenty cases above mentioned,  the decline of the goldworker's art when the use of enamels came into  vogue is evidenced. Continuing on to later periods, the decadence is  more marked under the successors of Alexander. In Rome, under the  emperors, we find gold used as a mere setting for precious stones, and  finally the collection terminates with examples of workmanship of the  time of Charlemagne, when the workmen had lost their cunning, and the  noble metal had been altogether debased to secondary uses.    The second instance where a lost art is exemplified in Signor  Castellani's collection is in the glazing of the Gubbio majolica. We  have not space here to review the magnificent series of ancient  specimens of pottery in detail; and thus it will suffice to say that,  beginning with some of the earliest pieces made by the Arabs when they  occupied Sicily, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century, the  collection presents examples of all the finest types of later mediaeval  art. Gubbio, where the peculiar kind of majolica above noted was made,  is a small town once in the territory of the dukes of Urbino; and in  the sixteenth century it became famous for its pottery. This was  attributable to the talent of one man, Giorgio Andreoli, who is  reputed to have invented the wonderful luster characteristic of the  Gubbio ware. The body of majolica is mere common clay; and after the  piece is finished on the wheel, it is dried and burnt in a furnace.  After the biscuit thus prepared has been dipped in the glaze, the  colors are applied on the soft surface of the latter, and the  vitrifying process fuses all into a glossy enamel of the color of the  pigment. This is still the common practice; and we mention it merely  to show that to his pigment and glaze Andreoli must have added some  third substance, which rendered the enamel capable of reflecting white  light as blue, red, green, or yellow light--in other words, of giving  the object a luster of a color wholly different from the tints of the  pigment. He evidently could produce any desired color at will, and the  effects gained are indescribably beautiful. The Castellani collection  contains 130 superb specimens, which glow like jewels. In one, the  scene of the nativity of Christ is provided with the figures in low  relief, and the exquisite cerulean lustre is imparted to give the  effect of moonlight. The rarest pieces are those of which the luster  is a delicate green. Some blaze with yellow, as if of gold; others  exhibit the brilliancy of the ruby; while others resemble the interior  of the pearl oyster shell. Whether this sheen is produced by  polarization of the light in some manner, or whether it is at all  analogous to fluorescence, is yet to be decided. The impression of the  surface with fine microscopic lines might produce an iridescence, but  not separate and clearly defined hues. The ware was intended for  ornamental purposes, not for household use; and it was suspended  against the rich, dark tapestries of the period with which walls were  covered, thus aiding, as it were, in illuminating the apartment with  its exquisite radiance.           *       *       *       *       *          THE BLUE GLASS DECEPTION.      On September 26, 1871, General A.J. Pleasonton, of Philadelphia, Pa.,  obtained a patent for \"utilizing the natural light of the sun  transmitted through clear glass, and the blue or electric(!) solar  rays transmitted through blue, purple, or violet colored glass, or its  equivalent, in the propagation and growth of plants and animals.\" In  his specification, of which the above constitutes one claim, he states  that he has discovered \"special and specific efficacy in the use of  this combination of the caloric rays of the sun and the electric blue  light in stimulating the glands of the body, the nervous system  generally, and the secretive organs of man and animals.\" He also  states that he finds that vegetation is vastly improved by the  transmitted blue light. These alleged re-discoveries--for the General  only claims to have devised the method of utilizing them--were  extensively promulgated through the press early in 1871. Subsequently,  in 1876, General Pleasonton published a book on the subject, the  volume being appropriately bound in blue and printed in blue ink.  Recently public attention has again been called to the subject by a  New York daily journal. The peculiar kind of glass in question is  known as \"pot metal blue,\" that is, it is stained a bluish violet  throughout, and is not clear glass covered with flashings of blue  glass. It is used in greenhouses, etc., in connection with clear  glass; and in General Pleasonton's grapery it appears that only every  eighth row of panes was blue. Some of the results alleged to have been  obtained by exposing animals and plants are as follows: Twenty grape  vines, in their second year, after being set out under the blue glass,  bore 1,200 lbs. of splendid fruit. A very weak Alderney bull calf was  in four months developed into a strong and vigorous bull. Heifers when  kept under blue glass may safely bear young when 18 months old. A weak  child, weighing but 31/2 lbs. at birth, weighed at the end of four  months 22 lbs.--the light in this instance having come through blue  curtains. Two major-generals with rheumatism were cured in three days.  A young lady whose hair had come out regained her tresses; and to  these must be added various other cures of severe ailments which we  have not space here to recapitulate. The above are the alleged facts;  and we propose to consider the supposed discovery in the light of  previous investigations.    With reference to the theories of electricity, etc., advanced by  General Pleasonton to account for his phenomena, their absurdity is so  complete that we shall waste no time over them. The important question  in the matter, and the only one in which the"]]]
