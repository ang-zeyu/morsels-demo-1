Modestly the large-eyed maiden--lifted up his garment's hem,      Round his shoulders threw she lightly--the bright zone of radiant flowers;      So she chose him for her husband--Nala, that high-hearted maid.      Then alas! alas! burst wildly,--from that conclave of the kings,      And \"well done, well done,\" as loudly--from the gods and sages broke;      All in their extatic wonder--glorified Nishadha's king.      Then to royal Damayanti--Virasena's kingly son,      To that slender waisted damsel--spake he comfort in his joy;      \"Since thou'st own'd me for thine husband--in the presence of the gods,      For thy faithful consort know me--aye delighting in thy words.      While this spirit fills this body--maiden with the smile serene!      Thine am I, so long thine only--this the solemn truth I vow.\"      Thus he gladdened Damayanti--with the assurance of his faith;      And the happy pair devoutly[49]--worshipped then the present gods.        Chosen thus Nishadha's monarch--the bright guardians of the world,      In their gladness all on Nala--eight transcendant gifts bestowed;      To discern the visible godhead--in the sacrifice, a gait      Firm and noble, Sachi's husband--Indra to king Nala gave.      Agni gave his own bright presence[50]--whensoe'er the monarch called.      All the worlds instinct with splendour--through his power Hutasa gave.      Subtle taste in food gave Yama--and in virtue eminence;      Varun gave obedient water--to be present at his call;      Garlands too of matchless fragrance;--each his double blessing gave.[51]      Thus bestowed their gracious favours--to the heavens the gods returned;      And the rajas, who with wonder--Nala's marriage saw confirmed      With the gentle Damayanti--as they came, in joy returned.      Thus the kings of earth departed;--Bhima in his joy and pride,      Solemnized the stately bridals--of the maiden and the king.      Fitting time when there he'd sojourned,--best of men, Nishadha's king;      Courteous parting with king Bhima--to his native city went.      Having gained the pearl of women--the majestic lord of earth      Lived in bliss, as with his Sachi,[52]--he that those old giants slew.      In his joy the elated monarch--shining radiant as the sun,      Ruled the subjects of his kingdom--with a just and equal sway.      Of the horse the famous offering[53]--like Nahucha's mighty son,      Every sacrifice performed he--with rich gifts to holy men.      And full oft in flowering gardens--and delicious shady groves,      Like a god, the royal Nala--took with Damayanti joy.      So begat from Damayanti--Nala, of heroic soul,      Indrasena one fair daughter--Indrasen one beauteous son.      Thus in sacrifice and pleasance--took his joy the king of men,      So the earth with riches teeming--ruled the sovereign of the earth.          BOOK VI.          Nala, chosen by Bhima's daughter--the bright guardians of the world,      As they parted thence, with Kali[54]--Dwapara approaching saw.      Kali as he saw, did Indra--did the giant-killer say,      \"Here, with Dwapara attended--whither, Kali, dost thou go?\"      Kali spake, \"the Swayembara--we of Damayanti seek;      Her I go to make my consort--into her mine heart hath passed.\"      \"Closed and ended is that bridal,\"--Indra answered with a smile,      \"Nala she hath chosen for husband--in the presence of us all.\"      Thus addressed by Indra, Kali--in the transport of his wrath,      All the heavenly gods saluting,--thus his malediction spake,      \"Since before the Immortals' presence--she a mortal spouse did choose,      Of her impious crime most justly--heavy be the penal doom.\"      Kali hardly thus had spoken--than the heaven-born gods replied:      \"With our full and liberal sanction--Damayanti chose her lord.      Who to Nala, with all virtue--rich endowed, would not incline?      He that rightly knows each duty--he who ever rightly acts,      He who reads the whole four Vedas--the Puranas too the fifth,[55]      In his palace with pure offerings--ever are the gods adored,      Gentle to all living creatures--true in word and strict in vow;      Good and constant he, and generous--holy, temperate, patient, pure;      His are all these virtues ever--equal to the earth-guarding gods.      Thus endowed, the noble Nala--he, O Kali, that would curse,      On himself recoil his curses--only fatal to himself.      Nala, gifted with such virtues--he, O Kali, who would curse--      Be he plunged in hell's dark torments--in the deep and vasty lake.\"      Thus the gods to Kali speaking--to their native heavens arose.      Soon as they had parted, Kali--thus to Dwapara began:      \"I my wrath can curb no longer--I henceforth in Nala dwell;      From his kingdom will I cast him--from his bliss with his sweet bride.      Thou within the dice embodied--Dwapara my cause assist.\"          BOOK VII.          Bound by that malignant treaty--Kali with his dark ally,      Haunted they the stately palace--where Nishadha's monarch ruled;      Watching still the fatal instant--in Nishadha long they dwelt.      Twelve long years had passed ere Kali--saw that fatal instant come.      Nala after act uncleanly--the ablution half performed,[56]      Prayed at eve, with feet unwashen--Kali seized the fatal hour.      Into Nala straight he entered--and possessed his inmost soul.      Pushkara in haste he summoned--come with Nala play at dice,      Ever in the gainful hazard--by my subtle aid thou'lt win,      Even the kingdom of Nishadha--even from Nala all his realm.      Pushkara by Kali summoned--to his brother Nala came,      In the dice of dice embodied[57]--Dwapara stood silent by.      Pushkara the hero-slayer--to king Nala standing near:      \"Play we with the dice, my brother,\"--thus again, again he said.      Long the lofty-minded raja--that bold challenge might not brook,      In Vidarbha's princess' presence--deemed he now the time for play.      For his wealth, his golden treasures--for his chariots, for his robes,      Then possessed by Kali, Nala--in the game was worsted still.      He with love of gaming maddened,--of his faithful friends not one      Might arrest the desperate frenzy--of the conqueror of his foes.      Came the citizens assembling--with the counsellors of state,      To behold the king approached they--to restrain his dread disease.      Then the charioteer advancing[58]--thus to Damayanti spake:      \"All the city, noble princess--stands assembled at the gate,      Say thou to Nishadha's monarch--'All his subjects here are met;      Ill they brook this dire misfortune[59]--in their justice-loving king'.\"      Then, her voice half choked with anguish--spake the sorrow-stricken queen,      Spirit-broken, Bhima's daughter--to Nishadha's sovereign spake,      \"Raja, lo! the assembled city--at the gate their king to see:      With the counsellors of wisdom--by their loyal duty led.      Deign thou, monarch, to admit them,\"--thus again, again she said.      To the queen with beauteous eyelids--uttering thus her sad lament,      Still possessed by wicked Kali--answered not the king a word.      Then those counsellors of wisdom--and those loyal citizens,      \"'Tis not he,\" exclaimed in sorrow,--and in shame and grief went home.      Thus of Pushkara and Nala--still went on that fatal play;      Many a weary month it lasted--and still lost the king of men.          BOOK VIII.          Damayanti then beholding--Punyasloka, king of men,[60]      Undistracted, him distracted--with the maddening love of play.      In her dread and in her sorrow--thus did Bhima's daughter speak;      Pondering on the weighty business--that concerned the king of men.      Trembling at his guilty frenzy--yet to please him still intent.      Nala, 'reft of all his treasures--when the noble woman saw,      Thus addressed she Vrihatsena,--her old faithful slave and nurse,      Friendly in all business dextrous--most devoted, wise in speech:      \"Vrihatsena, go, the council--as at Nala's call convene,      Say what he hath lost of treasure--and what treasure yet remains.\"      Then did all that reverend council--Nala's summons as they heard,      \"Our own fate is now in peril\"--speaking thus, approach the king.      And a second time his subjects--all assembling, crowded near,      And the queen announced their presence;--of her words he took no heed.      All her words thus disregarded--when king Bhima's daughter found,      To the palace, Damayanti--to conceal her shame returned.      When the dice she heard for ever--adverse to the king of men,      And of all bereft, her Nala--to the nurse again she spake:      \"Go again, my Vrihatsena,--in the name of Nala, go,      To the charioteer, Varshneya,--great the deed must now be done.\"      Vrihatsena on the instant--Damayanti's words she heard,      Caused the charioteer be summoned--by her messengers of trust.      Bhima's daughter to Varshneya--winning with her gentle voice,      Spake, the time, the place well choosing--for the deed, nor spake in vain:      \"Well thou know'st the full reliance--that in thee the king hath placed,      In his fatal hour of peril--wilt not thou stand forth to aid?      As by Pushkara is worsted--ever more and more the king,      More and more the fatal frenzy--maddens in his heart for play.      As to Pushkara obedient--ever fall the lucky dice,      Thus those dice to royal Nala--still with adverse fortune fall.      Nor the voice of friend or kindred--as beseems him, will he hear;      Even to me he will not listen--in the madness of his heart.

He was very fond of arithmetic.    During his nineteenth year he made up his mind to have a college  education.    His step-mother did not wish him to do this.    But he worked hard and saved his money.    A part of the time he taught school.    He was twenty-three when he entered Yale College.    He borrowed some money, for which he gave his note.    At one time one of the college teachers wished to show his pupils  some experiments. But some of the things to be used were broken.    Eli offered to mend them.    This he did, and succeeded in surprising every one.    A carpenter lived near his boarding place.    Eli asked for the loan of some of his tools.    The careful carpenter did not wish to lend them.    He at last gave his consent in this way:--    The gentleman with whom Mr. Whitney boarded must promise to pay all  the damages.    But he soon saw how skilful Mr. Whitney was.    He was surprised and said:    \"There was one good mechanic spoiled when you went to college.\"    Mr. Whitney graduated in 1792.    He was engaged by a gentleman in Georgia to teach his children.    It was on this journey to his new work that he met Mrs. Greene.    Mrs. Greene liked Mr. Whitney very much.    When they reached Savannah, she invited him to her home.    At this time he had a great disappointment.    The gentleman who had hired him to come to Georgia coolly told him  his services were not wanted.    He had no friends.    He was out of money.    But Mrs. Greene became his good friend.    He went to live at her house.    Here he began the study of law.    Mrs. Greene was one day doing some embroidery.    She broke the frame upon which she was working.    She did not know how to finish the work without it.    Mr. Whitney looked at it carefully.    Then he made her a new frame.    It was even better than the other one had been.    Of course Mrs. Greene was much pleased.    Mr. Whitney also made fine toys for the children.    Soon after this, a party of gentlemen visited at Mrs. Greene's home.    They were nearly all men who had been officers during the war.    Mr. Greene had been their general.    They began talking of the South.    They wished something might be done to improve that part of the  country.    They wished it might be made a better place in which to live.    They spoke of the fine spinning machines that were coming into use  in England.    Much land in the South could be used for cotton.    This could be sent to England for manufacture.    The South could become a rich country in this way.    But there was one great difficulty.    It cost so much to clean the cotton.    Mrs. Greene said, \"I know who can help you.    \"Apply to my young friend, Mr. Whitney. He can make anything.\"    She then showed the gentlemen her frame and other things which Mr.  Whitney had made.    Mr. Whitney said he had never seen cotton or its seed.    None was raised near the home of the Greene's.    Mr. Whitney did not make any promises.    But the next day he went to work.    He went first to the city of Savannah.    There he searched among the warehouses and boats.    At last he found a small parcel of cotton.    This he carried home.    He shut himself up in a small basement room.    His tools were poor.    He made better ones.    No wire could be bought in Savannah.    So he made his own wire.    Mrs. Greene and a Mr. Miller were the only persons allowed to come  into his work-shop.    Day after day the children wondered to hear the queer clinking and  hammering.    They laughed at Mr. Whitney.    But that did not trouble him.    Before the end of the winter the machine was nearly perfect.    Its success seemed certain.    Mrs. Greene was very happy over the work.    She was eager that people should know about this wonderful  invention.    She could not wait until a patent was secured.    A patent is given by the government.    It is given to prevent others from claiming an invention.    Often it keeps people from manufacturing the article without the  permission of the owner.    So Mrs. Green invited a party of gentlemen from all parts of the  state to visit her.    These gentlemen were taken to see the machine do its work.    They were greatly astonished.    For what did they see?    This curious little machine cleaned the cotton of its seed.    And it would clean in a day more than a man could do in months.    They went to their homes.    They told everybody about it.    Great crowds began coming to see it.    But they were refused permission to do so.    This was because it had not yet been patented.    So one night some wicked men broke into the building.    They stole the cotton-gin.    You can well imagine how dreadful this was.    Mr. Whitney had no money.    So Mr. Miller agreed to be his partner.    Mr. Miller had come to Georgia from the North.    He, too, was a graduate of Yale College.    He afterward married Mrs. Greene.    He became Mr. Whitney's partner in May, 1773.    Perhaps you wonder why the machine was called a gin. It was a short  way of saying engine.    A gin is a machine that aids the work of a person.    The cotton-gin was made to work much the same as the hand of a  person.    It dragged the cotton away from the seed.    And now begins the sorrowful part of the story.    Before Mr. Whitney could get his patent, several other gins had been  made.    Each claimed to be the best.    The plans were all stolen from Mr. Whitney's.      [Illustration: ROLLER-GIN.]    One was the roller-gin.    This crushed the seed in the cotton.    Of course this injured the cotton.    Another was the saw-gin.    This was exactly like Mr. Whitney's, except that the saws were set  differently.    Many lawsuits were begun.    Mr. Whitney went to Connecticut.    There he had a shop for making the gins.    When the suits began he had to return to Georgia.    In this way two years went by.    By this time everyone knew the value of the gin.    Mr. Whitney went to New York.    There he became ill.    His illness lasted three weeks.    Then he was able to go on to New Haven.      [Illustration: SAW-GIN, 1794.]    There he found that his shop had been destroyed by fire.    All his machines and papers were burned.    He was four thousand dollars in debt.    But neither Mr. Miller nor Mr. Whitney were the kind of men who give  up easily.    Mr. Miller wrote that he would give all his time, thought, labor,  and all the money he could borrow to help.    \"It shall never be said that we gave up when a little perseverance  would have carried us through,\" he said.    About this time bad news came from England.    The cotton, you remember, was then all sent there for manufacture.    English manufacturers now claimed that the cotton was injured by the  gin.    This was in 1796.    Miller and Whitney had thirty gins working in different places in  Georgia.    Some were worked by cattle and horses.    Others were run by water.    Soon, however, the manufacturers found that the Whitney cotton gin  did not injure the cotton.    The first lawsuit was decided against Miller and Whitney.    They asked for another trial.    But this was refused them.    Everywhere through the South they were cheated and robbed.    Yet all the time the South was growing richer because of the cotton  gin.    Slaves grew more and more valuable.    For negroes can endure the heat of the cotton fields.    But white men can not.    The planters of the South bought more and more slaves.    So slavery grew stronger because of the cotton gin.    Several states made contracts with Mr. Whitney.    They agreed to pay him certain sums of money.    But South Carolina broke her contract.    All these things made Mr. Whitney sick at heart.    He said that he had tried hard to do right by every one.    And it stung him to the very soul to be treated like a swindler or a  villain.    The people of Georgia tried to prove that somebody in Switzerland  had invented the cotton gin.    Tennessee broke its contract.    There were high-minded men who tried to help Mr. Whitney.    They were able to do only a little for him.    In 1803, Mr. Miller died.    Mr. Whitney was then left to fight his battles alone.    Things grew a little brighter as time went on.    Mr. Whitney received some money on his invention.    But the greater part of it had to be spent in lawsuits.    A suit was begun in the United States Court.    But the time of his patent was almost out.    He had made six journeys to Georgia.    One gentleman said that he never knew another man so persevering.    In 1798, Mr. Whitney made a contract with the government of the  United States.    By this contract he was to manufacture fire-arms.    He established his factory near New Haven.    The place is now called Whitneyville.    It is a beautiful place.    A waterfall furnished the power to run his machinery.    Here Mr. Whitney worked hard.    He had machinery to make.    He had to teach his own workmen.    For eight years he worked to fill this contract.    He arose as soon as day appeared.    Look in any part of the factory you might, you would see something  which he, himself had done.    He improved many tools.    He made better guns than had ever been made.    So that for these things, too, our country is indebted to Mr.  Whitney.    In 1812, he made new contracts.    Another war with England began in that year.    Mr. Whitney's guns never failed to be all right.    Other men took contracts of the same kind.    But their guns were failures.    Mr. Calhoun, the Secretary of War, said to Mr. Whitney, \"You are  saving your country seventy-five thousand dollars a year.\"    This was by his improvements in fire-arms.    Mr. Whitney tried to get the government to extend the time of the  patent upon the cotton-gin.    But this was refused.    That did not seem very grateful, did it?
