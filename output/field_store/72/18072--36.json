[Sidenote 1: _Plutarch. de tranq. anim._]      [Sidenote 2: _Iuvenal._]    It may be, that _Aristotle_ was moved to this opinion, that hee might  thereby take from _Alexander_ the occasion of this feare and discontent,  or else, perhaps, _Aristotle_ himselfe was as loth to hold the  possibility of a world which he could not discover, as _Alexander_ was  to heare of one which he could not conquer. Tis likely that some such  by-respect moved him to this opinion, since the arguments he urges for  it are confest by his zealous followers and commentators, to be very  sleight and frivolous, and they themselves grant, what I am now to  prove, that there is not any evidence in the light of naturall reason,  which can sufficiently manifest that there is but one world.    But however some may object, would it not be inconvenient and dangerous  to admit of such opinions that doe destroy those principles of  _Aristotle_, which all the world hath so long followed?    This question is much controverted by the _Romish_ Divines; _Campanella_  hath writ a Treatise[1] in defence of it, in whom you may see many  things worth the reading and notice.      [Sidenote 1: _Apologia pro Galilaeo._]    To it I answer, that this position in Philosophy, doth not bring any  inconvenience to the rest, since tis not _Aristotle_, but truth that  should be the rule of our opinions, and if they be not both found  together, wee may say to him, as hee said to his Master _Plato_,      +amphoin gar ontoin philoin, hosion protiman ten aletheian+.[1]      \"Though _Plato_ were his friend, yet hee would rather adhere to    truth than him.\"      [Sidenote 1: _Ethic. l. 1. c. 6._]    I must needs grant, that wee are all much beholden to the industry of  the ancient Philosophers, and more especially to _Aristotle_, for the  greater part of our learning, but yet tis not ingratitude to speake  against him, when hee opposeth truth; for then many of the Fathers would  be very guilty, especially _Iustin_, who hath writ a Treatise purposely  against him.    But suppose this opinion were false, yet 'tis not against the faith, and  so it may serve for the better confirmation of that which is true; the  sparkes of errour, being forc'd out by opposition, as the sparkes of  fire, by the striking of the flint and steele. But suppose too that it  were hereticall, and against the faith, yet may it be admitted with the  same priviledge as _Aristotle_, from whom many more dangerous opinions  have proceeded: as that the world is eternall, that God cannot have  while to looke after these inferiour things, that after death there is  no reward or punishment, and such like blasphemies, which strike  directly at the fundamentalls of our Religion.    So that it is justly to be wondred why some should be so superstitious  in these daies, as to sticke closer unto him, than unto Scripture, as if  his Philosophy were the onely foundation of all divine truths.    Upon these grounds both St. _Uincentius_and _Senafinus_ _de firmo_ (as I  have seene them quoted) thinke that _Aristotle_ was the viol of Gods  wrath, which was powred out upon the waters of Wisedome by the third  Angel;[1] But for my part, I thinke the world is much beholden to  _Aristotle_ for all its sciences. But yet twere a shame for these later  ages to rest our selves meerely upon the labours of our Fore-fathers, as  if they had informed us of all things to be knowne, and when wee are set  upon their shoulders, not to see further then they themselves did.  'Twere a superstitious, a lazie opinion to thinke _Aristotles_ workes  the bounds and limits of all humane invention, beyond which there could  be no possibility of reaching. Certainly there are yet many things left  to discovery, and it cannot be any inconvenience for us, to maintaine a  new truth, or rectifie an ancient errour.      [Sidenote 1: Rev. 16. 4.]    But the position (say some) is directly against Scripture, for    1. _Moses_ tells us but of one world, and his History of the creation  had beene very imperfect if God had made another.    2. Saint _John_ speaking of Gods workes, saies he made the world, in the  singular number, and therefore there is but one:[1] 'tis the argument of  _Aquinas_, and he thinks that none will oppose it, but such who with  _Democritus_ esteeme some blinde chance, and not any wise providence to  be the framer of all things.      [Sidenote 1: Part 1. Q. 47. Art. 3.]    3. The opinion of more worlds has in ancient time beene accounted a  heresie, and _Baronius_ affirmes that for this very reason, _Virgilius_  was cast out of his Bishopricke, and excommunicated from the Church.[1]      [Sidenote 1: _Annal. Eccl. A.D. 748._]    4. A fourth argument there is urged by _Aquinas_, if there be more  worlds than one, then they must either be of the same, or of a diverse  nature, but they are not of the same kinde,[1] for this were needlesse,  and would argue an improvidence, since one would have no more perfection  than the other; not of divers kinds, for then one of them could not be  called the world or universe, since it did not containe universall  perfection, I have cited this argument, because it is so much stood upon  by _Iulius Caesar la Galla_,[2] one that has purposely writ a Treatise  against this opinion which I now deliver, but the Dilemma is so blunt,  that it cannot cut on either side, and the consequences so weake, that I  dare trust them without an answer; And (by the way) you may see this  Author in that place, where he endeavours to prove a necessity of one  world, doth leave the chiefe matter in hand, and take much needlesse  paines to dispute against _Democritus_, who thought that the world was  made by the casuall concourse of _atoms_ in a great _vacuum_. It should  seeme, that either his cause, or his skill was weake, or else he would  have ventured upon a stronger adversary. These arguments which I have  set downe, are the chiefest which I have met with against this subject,  and yet the best of these hath not force enough to endanger the truth  that I have delivered.      [Sidenote 1: _Ibid._]      [Sidenote 2: _De Phaenom. in orbe lunae._]    Unto the two first it may be answered, that the negative authority of  Scripture is not prevalent in those things which are not the  fundamentalls of Religion.    But you'le reply, though it doe not necessarily conclude, yet 'tis  probable if there had beene another world, wee should have had some  notice of it in Scripture.    I answer, 'tis as probable that the Scripture should have informed us of  the Planets they being very remarkable parts of the Creation, and yet  neither _Moses_ nor _Job_, nor the _Psalmes_ (the places most frequent  in Astronomicall observations) mention any of them but the Sunne and  Moone, and moreover, you must know, that 'tis besides the scope of the  Holy Ghost either in the new Testament or in the old, to reveale any  thing unto us concerning the secrets of Philosophy; 'tis not his intent  in the new Testament, since we cannot conceive how it might any way  belong either to the Historicall exegeticall or propheticall parts of  it: nor is it his intent in the old Testament, as is well observed by  our Countrey-man Master WRIGHT.[1]      _Non Mosis aut Prophetarum institutum fuisse videtur Mathematicas    aliquas aut Physicas subtilitates promulgare, sed ad vulgi captum    & loquendi morem quemadmodum nutrices infantulis solent sese    accommodare._      \"'Tis not the endeavour of _Moses_ or the Prophets to discover any    Mathematicall or Philosophicall subtilties, but rather to accomodate    themselves to vulgar capacities, and ordinary speech, as nurses are    wont to use their infants.\"    True indeede, _Moses_ is there to handle the history of the Creation,  but 'tis observed that he does not any where meddle with such matters as  were very hard to be apprehended, for being to informe the common people  as well as others, he does it after a vulgar way, as it is commonly  noted, declaring the originall chiefely of those things which were  obvious to the sense, and being silent of other things, which then could  not well be apprehended. And therefore _Aquinas_ observes,[2] that  _Moses_ writes nothing of the aire, because that being invisible, the  people knew not whether there were any such body or no. And for this  very reason Saint _Austin_ also thinkes that there is nothing exprest  concerning the creation of Angels which notwithstanding are as  remarkable parts of the creatures, and as fit to be knowne as another  world. And therefore the Holy Ghost too uses such vulgar expressions  which set things forth rather as they appeare, then as they are,[3] as  when he calls the Moone one of the greater lights #hame'orot hagdolim#  whereas 'tis the least, but one that wee can see in the whole heavens.  So afterwards speaking of the great raine which drowned the world,[4]  he saies, the windowes of heaven were opened, because it seemed to  come with that violence, as if it were, poured out from windows in the  Firmament.[5] So that the phrases which the Holy Ghost uses concerning  these things are not to be understood in a literall sense; but rather  as vulgar expressions, and this rule is set downe by Saint _Austin_,  where speaking concerning that in the Psalme, _who stretched the earth  upon the waters_,[6] hee notes, that when the words of Scripture shall  seeme to contradict common sense or experience, there are they to be  understood in a qualified sense, and not according to the letter. And  'tis observed that for want of this rule, some of the ancients have  fastened strange absurdities upon the words of the Scripture. So Saint  _Ambrose_ esteemed it a heresie, to thinke, that the Sunne and starres  were not very hot, as being against the words of Scripture,[7] _Psalm._  19. 6. where the _Psalmist_ sayes that there is nothing that is hid from  the heate of the Sunne. So"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1911"],[0,"Concerning Christian Liberty; with Letter of Martin Luther to Pope Leo X. (#4)"],[1,"ndemnation, not by any outward  sin or work. Therefore the first care of every Christian ought to be to  lay aside all reliance on works, and strengthen his faith alone more  and more, and by it grow in the knowledge, not of works, but of Christ  Jesus, who has suffered and risen again for him, as Peter teaches  (1 Peter v.) when he makes no other work to be a Christian one. Thus  Christ, when the Jews asked Him what they should do that they might work  the works of God, rejected the multitude of works, with which He saw  that they were puffed up, and commanded them one thing only, saying,  \"This is the work of God: that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent, for  Him hath God the Father sealed\" (John vi. 27, 29).    Hence a right faith in Christ is an incomparable treasure, carrying with  it universal salvation and preserving from all evil, as it is said, \"He  that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth  not shall be damned\" (Mark xvi. 16). Isaiah, looking to this treasure,  predicted, \"The consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.  For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined  (verbum abbreviatum et consummans), in the midst of the land\" (Isa.  x. 22, 23). As if he said, \"Faith, which is the brief and complete  fulfilling of the law, will fill those who believe with such  righteousness that they will need nothing else for justification.\" Thus,  too, Paul says, \"For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness\"  (Rom. x. 10).    But you ask how it can be the fact that faith alone justifies, and  affords without works so great a treasure of good things, when so many  works, ceremonies, and laws are prescribed to us in the Scriptures?  I answer, Before all things bear in mind what I have said: that faith  alone without works justifies, sets free, and saves, as I shall show  more clearly below.    Meanwhile it is to be noted that the whole Scripture of God is divided  into two parts: precepts and promises. The precepts certainly teach us  what is good, but what they teach is not forthwith done. For they show  us what we ought to do, but do not give us the power to do it. They  were ordained, however, for the purpose of showing man to himself, that  through them he may learn his own impotence for good and may despair of  his own strength. For this reason they are called the Old Testament, and  are so.    For example, \"Thou shalt not covet,\" is a precept by which we are all  convicted of sin, since no man can help coveting, whatever efforts to  the contrary he may make. In order therefore that he may fulfil the  precept, and not covet, he is constrained to despair of himself and  to seek elsewhere and through another the help which he cannot find in  himself; as it is said, \"O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in  Me is thine help\" (Hosea xiii. 9). Now what is done by this one precept  is done by all; for all are equally impossible of fulfilment by us.    Now when a man has through the precepts been taught his own impotence,  and become anxious by what means he may satisfy the law--for the  law must be satisfied, so that no jot or tittle of it may pass away,  otherwise he must be hopelessly condemned--then, being truly humbled and  brought to nothing in his own eyes, he finds in himself no resource for  justification and salvation.    Then comes in that other part of Scripture, the promises of God, which  declare the glory of God, and say, \"If you wish to fulfil the law, and,  as the law requires, not to covet, lo! believe in Christ, in whom are  promised to you grace, justification, peace, and liberty.\" All these  things you shall have, if you believe, and shall be without them if you  do not believe. For what is impossible for you by all the works of the  law, which are many and yet useless, you shall fulfil in an easy and  summary way through faith, because God the Father has made everything to  depend on faith, so that whosoever has it has all things, and he who has  it not has nothing. \"For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that  He might have mercy upon all\" (Rom. xi. 32). Thus the promises of God  give that which the precepts exact, and fulfil what the law commands;  so that all is of God alone, both the precepts and their fulfilment. He  alone commands; He alone also fulfils. Hence the promises of God belong  to the New Testament; nay, are the New Testament.    Now, since these promises of God are words of holiness, truth,  righteousness, liberty, and peace, and are full of universal goodness,  the soul, which cleaves to them with a firm faith, is so united to them,  nay, thoroughly absorbed by them, that it not only partakes in, but  is penetrated and saturated by, all their virtues. For if the touch of  Christ was healing, how much more does that most tender spiritual touch,  nay, absorption of the word, communicate to the soul all that belongs to  the word! In this way therefore the soul, through faith alone, without  works, is from the word of God justified, sanctified, endued with truth,  peace, and liberty, and filled full with every good thing, and is truly  made the child of God, as it is said, \"To them gave He power to become  the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name\" (John i. 12).    From all this it is easy to understand why faith has such great power,  and why no good works, nor even all good works put together, can compare  with it, since no work can cleave to the word of God or be in the soul.  Faith alone and the word reign in it; and such as is the word, such is  the soul made by it, just as iron exposed to fire glows like fire, on  account of its union with the fire. It is clear then that to a Christian  man his faith suffices for everything, and that he has no need of works  for justification. But if he has no need of works, neither has he need  of the law; and if he has no need of the law, he is certainly free from  the law, and the saying is true, \"The law is not made for a righteous  man\" (1 Tim. i. 9). This is that Christian liberty, our faith, the  effect of which is, not that we should be careless or lead a bad life,  but that no one should need the law or works for justification and  salvation.    Let us consider this as the first virtue of faith; and let us look also  to the second. This also is an office of faith: that it honours with the  utmost veneration and the highest reputation Him in whom it believes,  inasmuch as it holds Him to be truthful and worthy of belief. For there  is no honour like that reputation of truth and righteousness with which  we honour Him in whom we believe. What higher credit can we attribute  to any one than truth and righteousness, and absolute goodness? On  the other hand, it is the greatest insult to brand any one with the  reputation of falsehood and unrighteousness, or to suspect him of these,  as we do when we disbelieve him.    Thus the soul, in firmly believing the promises of God, holds Him to be  true and righteous; and it can attribute to God no higher glory than  the credit of being so. The highest worship of God is to ascribe to Him  truth, righteousness, and whatever qualities we must ascribe to one in  whom we believe. In doing this the soul shows itself prepared to do His  whole will; in doing this it hallows His name, and gives itself up to  be dealt with as it may please God. For it cleaves to His promises, and  never doubts that He is true, just, and wise, and will do, dispose, and  provide for all things in the best way. Is not such a soul, in this its  faith, most obedient to God in all things? What commandment does there  remain which has not been amply fulfilled by such an obedience? What  fulfilment can be more full than universal obedience? Now this is not  accomplished by works, but by faith alone.    On the other hand, what greater rebellion, impiety, or insult to God  can there be, than not to believe His promises? What else is this, than  either to make God a liar, or to doubt His truth--that is, to attribute  truth to ourselves, but to God falsehood and levity? In doing this,  is not a man denying God and setting himself up as an idol in his own  heart? What then can works, done in such a state of impiety, profit us,  were they even angelic or apostolic works? Rightly hath God shut up  all, not in wrath nor in lust, but in unbelief, in order that those  who pretend that they are fulfilling the law by works of purity and  benevolence (which are social and human virtues) may not presume  that they will therefore be saved, but, being included in the sin of  unbelief, may either seek mercy, or be justly condemned.    But when God sees that truth is ascribed to Him, and that in the faith  of our hearts He is honoured with all the honour of which He is worthy,  then in return He honours us on account of that faith, attributing to  us truth and righteousness. For faith does truth and righteousness in  rendering to God what is His; and therefore in return God gives glory  to our righteousness. It is true and righteous that God is true and  righteous; and to confess this and ascribe these attributes to Him, this  it is to be true and righteous. Thus He says, \"Them that honour Me I  will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed\" (1 Sam.  ii. 30). And so Paul says that Abraham's faith was imputed to him for  righteousness, because by it he gave glory to God; and that to us  also, for the same reason, it shall be imputed for righteousness, if we  believe (Rom. iv.).    The third incomparable grace of faith is this: that it unites the soul  to Christ, as the wife to the husband, by which mystery, as the Apostle  teaches, Christ and the soul are made one flesh. Now if they are one  flesh, and if a true marriage--nay, by far the most perfect of all  marriages--is accomplished between them (for human marriages are but  feeble types of this one great marriage), then it follows that all they  have becomes theirs in common, as well "]]]
