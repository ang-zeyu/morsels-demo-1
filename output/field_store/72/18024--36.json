The further study of living bodies leads to the province of biology,  of which there are two great divisions--botany, which deals with  plants, and zooelogy, which treats of animals.    Each of these divisions has its subdivisions--such as morphology,  which treats of the form, structure, and development of living beings,  and physiology, which explains their actions or functions, besides  others.    [Illustration]          LIFE GROWTH;--FROGS    (FROM A SONG OF LIFE.)    BY MARGARET WARNER MORLEY.[1]    [1] Copyright by A. C. McClurg & Co., 1891.      [Illustration]    Somewhat higher than the fish in the scale of life is the frog.  Although he begins life as a fish, and in the tadpole state breathes  by gills, he soon discards the water-diluted air of the pond, and with  perfect lungs boldly inhales the pure air of the upper world. His life  as a tadpole, although so fish-like, is much inferior to true fish  life: for though the fish has not the perfect lung, he has a  modification of it which he fills with air, not for breathing  purposes, but as an air-sac to make him float like a bubble in the  water. Will he rise to the surface? he inflates the air-bladder. Will  he sink to the bottom? he compresses the air-bladder. But in the frog  the air-bladder changes into the lungs, and is never the delicate  balloon which floats the fish in aqueous space. When the frog's lungs  are perfected, his gills close, and he forever abandons fish-life,  though being a cold-blooded creature he needs comparatively little  air, and delights to return to his childhood's home in the bottom of  the pond. But although he can stay under water for a long time, he is  obliged to hold his breath while there, and when he would breathe must  come to the surface to do so. It is possible to drown him by holding  him under water.    [Illustration: A FROG.]    As a feeder the frog relies upon animal life, which he expertly seizes  with a tongue fastened by the wrong end, as compared with our tongues.  He is a certain marksman, and when he aims at an insect the chances  are that the insect will enter his stomach and be there speedily  changed into a new form of animal life.    Although from the moment the gills disappear the frog is a true land  animal, he is obliged, on account of the fish-like character of his  young, to lay his eggs in the water. For this purpose the frogs enter  the pools in early spring. The surface of every country pond swarms  with the bright-eyed little creatures. They have awakened from a  long, cold, winter sleep, to find the spring about them and within  them. Life has suddenly become abundant and joyous. Their sluggish  blood flows faster, their hearts beat quicker; they leap, they swim,  they swell out their throats and call to each other in various keys.  The toads are with them, and the pretty tree-frogs that change their  color to suit their emotions. And all are rapturously screaming. Their  voices are not musical, according to man's standard, but seem to  afford great satisfaction to the performers in the shrill orchestra of  the swamps, who thus give vent to the flood of life that sweeps  through them after the still, icy winter.    As though the new spring-life were too plentiful to find room in the  frogs and toads already existing, it calls for more frogs and toads;  and new creatures are born to share the extra vitality. Like the  flowers and the fish, the frogs, too, give forth new life. Within  them, too, the miracle is performed. The tiny eggs of the one wake up  and begin to grow. The tiny living bodies in the fertilizing principle  of the other also wake up and begin to grow. But higher life is better  guarded, because less prolific. The frog and the toad lay but few eggs  as compared with the fish. Fish eggs may drop under the stones or  float away, and so escape the vital touch of the fertilizing  principle. There are so many that numbers may be lost and yet enough  remain to continue the family. Not so with the frog family. No egg may  be lost. So we find that the eggs of the frog are not dropped singly,  like so many shot, but are bound together by a colorless, transparent,  jelly-like substance, much like that found in the morning-glory seed,  and which like that supplies nourishment to the young life, for the  tadpole feeds upon it until he is able to seek other food. Moreover,  instinct has taught the frog the need of extreme caution in the act of  fertilization. Every egg _must_ be fertilized. As the time draws near  for the dropping of the few eggs into the water, the male frog so  places himself that the moment the eggs are being laid, he pours over  them, one by one, as they fall into the water, the fertilizing fluid.    And thus the mystery of life is again repeated. The union of the  living, microscopic bodies of the fertilizing principle with the new  laid egg is followed by the growth of the two elements into a living  creature, able to eat, to breathe, to see, to feel. In some unknown  way the atom of fertilizing principle seems to have contained the  whole life of the father-frog, for it can give to his sons and  daughters any of his peculiarities, either of color, form, motion, or  disposition; and the tiny egg seems to have contained the whole life  of the mother-frog, and can give to her sons and daughters any of her  peculiarities; though, as is true of all inheritance, the tadpoles, as  the young frogs are called, share the natures of both parents,  inheriting some peculiarities from the father and others from the  mother.    [Illustration: A FROG.]    But, like other life, although the frogs may vary a good deal within  frog limits, none of them can escape their own limits and enter into  those of any other life. Once a frog, always a frog; and no frog-egg  may hope to develop into a turtle, or a bird, or anything but a frog.  The life in the fertilizing principle of the frog is sacred to frog  eggs, and is lifeless in contact with any other.    Our common frogs, like many of the fishes, do not trouble themselves  about the fate of their eggs after they are carefully laid in a safe  place. They trust Mother Nature to see the little tadpoles safely  through the perils of childhood, to help them change their dresses and  get rid of their tails, and cut, not their teeth, but their arms and  legs.    In Venezuela, however, there dwells a frog with well developed  maternal instinct. The mothers have pockets on their backs, not for  their own convenience, but as cradles for their babies. The fathers  put the fertilized eggs into the pockets of the mothers; and there  they remain, well guarded, until the young are able to care for  themselves.    [Illustration: TADPOLES.]          THE MAN-LIKE APES    (FROM EVIDENCE AS TO MAN'S PLACE IN NATURE.)    BY PROFESSOR T. H. HUXLEY.      [Illustration: HEAD OF GORILLA.]    Sound knowledge respecting the habits and mode of life of the man-like  Apes has been even more difficult of attainment than correct  information regarding their structure.    Once in a generation, a Wallace may be found physically, mentally, and  morally qualified to wander unscathed through the tropical wilds of  America and of Asia, to form magnificent collections as he wanders,  and withal to think out sagaciously the conclusions suggested by his  collections; but, to the ordinary explorer or collector, the dense  forests of equatorial Asia and Africa, which constitute the favorite  habitation of the Orang, the Chimpanzee, and the Gorilla, present  difficulties of no ordinary magnitude; and the man who risks his life  by even a short visit to the malarious shores of those regions may  well be excused if he shrinks from facing the dangers of the interior;  if he contents himself with stimulating the industry of the  better-seasoned natives, and collecting and collating the more or less  mythical reports and traditions with which they are too ready to  supply him.    In such a manner most of the earlier accounts of the habits of the  man-like Apes originated; and even now a good deal of what passes  current must be admitted to have no very safe foundation. The best  information we possess is that based almost wholly on direct European  testimony respecting the Gibbons; the next best evidence relates to  the Orangs; while our knowledge of the habits of the Chimpanzee and  the Gorilla stands much in need of support and enlargement by  additional testimony from instructed European eye-witnesses.    It will therefore be convenient in endeavoring to form a notion of  what we are justified in believing about these animals, to commence  with the best known man-like Apes, the Gibbons, and Orangs; and to  make use of the perfectly reliable information respecting them as a  sort of criterion of the probable truth or falsehood of assertions  respecting the others.    Of the Gibbons, half a dozen species are found scattered over the  Asiatic Islands, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and through Malacca, Siam,  Arracan, and an uncertain extent of Hindostan on the mainland of Asia.  The largest attain a few inches above three feet in height, from the  crown to the heel, so that they are shorter than the other man-like  Apes, while the slenderness of their bodies renders their mass far  smaller in proportion even to this diminished height.    Dr. Salomon Mueller, an accomplished Dutch naturalist, who lived for  many years in the Eastern Archipelago, and to the result of whose  personal experience I shall frequently have occasion to refer, states  that the Gibbons are true mountaineers, loving the slopes and edges of  the hills, though they rarely ascend beyond the limit of the  fig-trees. All day long they haunt the tops of the tall trees, and  though toward evening, they descend"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B. Anthony, on the Charge of (#4)"],[1,"in this case, are  as follows:    \"If at any election for representative or delegate in the Congress of  the United States, any person shall knowingly ... vote without having a  lawful right to vote ... every such person shall be deemed guilty of a  crime, ... and on conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not  exceeding $500, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years,  or by both, in the discretion of the court, and shall pay the costs of  prosecution.\"    The only alleged ground of illegality of the defendant's vote is that  she is a woman. If the same act had been done by her brother under the  same circumstances, the act would have been not only innocent, but  honorable and laudable; but having been done by a woman it is said to be  a crime. The crime therefore consists not in the act done, but in the  simple fact that the person doing it was a woman and not a man. I  believe this is the first instance in which a woman has been arraigned  in a criminal court, merely on account of her sex.    If the advocates of female suffrage had been allowed to choose the point  of attack to be made upon their position, they could not have chosen it  more favorably for themselves; and I am disposed to thank those who have  been instrumental in this proceeding, for presenting it in the form of a  criminal prosecution.    Women have the same interest that men have in the establishment and  maintenance of good government; they are to the same extent as men  bound to obey the laws; they suffer to the same extent by bad laws, and  profit to the same extent by good laws; and upon principles of equal  justice, as it would seem, should be allowed equally with men, to  express their preference in the choice of law-makers and rulers. But  however that may be, no greater _absurdity_, to use no harsher term,  could be presented, than that of rewarding men and punishing women, for  the same act, _without giving to women any voice in the question which  should be rewarded, and which punished_.    I am aware, however, that we are here to be governed by the Constitution  and laws as they are, and that if the defendant has been guilty of  violating the law, she must submit to the penalty, however unjust or  absurd the law may be. But courts are not required to so interpret laws  or constitutions as to produce either absurdity or injustice, so long as  they are open to a more reasonable interpretation. This must be my  excuse for what I design to say in regard to the propriety of female  suffrage, because with that propriety established there is very little  difficulty in finding sufficient warrant in the constitution for its  exercise.    This case, in its legal aspects, presents three questions, which I  purpose to discuss.    1. Was the defendant legally entitled to vote at the election in  question?    2. If she was not entitled to vote, but believed that she was, and voted  in good faith in that belief, did such voting constitute a crime under  the statute before referred to?    3. Did the defendant vote in good faith in that belief?    If the first question be decided in accordance with my views, the other  questions become immaterial; if the second be decided adversely to my  views, the first and third become immaterial. The two first are  questions of law to be decided by the court, the other is a question for  the jury.    [The Judge here suggested that the argument should be confined to the  legal questions, and the argument on the other question suspended, until  his opinion on those questions should be made known. This suggestion was  assented to, and the counsel proceeded.]    My first position is that the defendant had the same right to vote as  any other citizen who voted at that election.    Before proceeding to the discussion of the purely legal question, I  desire, as already intimated, to pay some attention to the propriety and  justice of the rule which I claim to have been established by the  Constitution.    Miss Anthony, and those united with her in demanding the right of  suffrage, claim, and with a strong appearance of justice, that upon the  principles upon which our government is founded, and which lie at the  basis of all just government, every citizen has a right to take part,  upon equal terms with every other citizen, in the formation and  administration of government. This claim on the part of the female sex  presents a question the magnitude of which is not well appreciated by  the writers and speakers who treat it with ridicule. Those engaged in  the movement are able, sincere and earnest women, and they will not be  silenced by such ridicule, nor even by the villainous caricatures of  Nast. On the contrary, they justly place all those things to the account  of the wrongs which they think their sex has suffered. They believe,  with an intensity of feeling which men who have not associated with them  have not yet learned, that their sex has not had, and has not now, its  just and true position in the organization of government and society.  They may be wrong in their position, but they will not be content until  their arguments are fairly, truthfully and candidly answered.    In the most celebrated document which has been put forth on this side of  the Atlantic, our ancestors declared that \"governments derive their just  powers from the consent of the governed.\"    Blackstone says, \"The lawfulness of punishing such criminals (i.e.,  persons offending merely against the laws of society) is founded upon  this principle: that the law by which they suffer was made by their own  consent; it is a part of the original contract into which they entered  when first they engaged in society; it was calculated for and has long  contributed to their own security.\"    Quotations, to an unlimited extent, containing similar doctrines from  eminent writers, both English and American, on government, from the time  of John Locke to the present day, might be made. Without adopting this  doctrine which bases the rightfulness of government upon the consent of  the governed, I claim that there is implied in it the narrower and  unassailable principle that all citizens of a State, who are bound by  its laws, are entitled to an equal voice in the making and execution of  such laws. The doctrine is well stated by Godwin in his treatise on  Political Justice. He says: \"The first and most important principle that  can be imagined relative to the form and structure of government, seems  to be this: that as government is a transaction in the name and for the  benefit of the whole, every member of the community ought to have some  share in its administration.\"    Again, \"Government is a contrivance instituted for the security of  individuals; and it seems both reasonable that each man should have a  share in providing for his own security, and probable, that partiality  and cabal should by this means be most effectually excluded.\"    And again, \"To give each man a voice in the public concerns comes  nearest to that admirable idea of which we should never lose sight, the  uncontrolled exercise of private judgment. Each man would thus be  inspired with a consciousness of his own importance, and the slavish  feelings that shrink up the soul in the presence of an imagined superior  would be unknown.\"    The mastery which this doctrine, whether right or wrong, has acquired  over the public mind, has produced as its natural fruit, the extension  of the right of suffrage to all the adult male population in nearly all  the states of the Union; a result which was well epitomized by President  Lincoln, in the expression, \"government by the people for the people.\"    This extension of the suffrage is regarded by many as a source of danger  to the stability of free government. I believe it furnishes the greatest  security for free government, as it deprives the mass of the people of  all motive for revolution; and that government so based is most safe,  not because the whole people are less liable to make mistakes in  government than a select few, but because they have no interest which  can lead them to such mistakes, or to prevent their correction when  made. On the contrary, the world has never seen an aristocracy, whether  composed of few or many, powerful enough to control a government, who  did not honestly believe that their interest was identical with the  public interest, and who did not act persistently in accordance with  such belief; and, unfortunately, an aristocracy of sex has not proved an  exception to the rule. The only method yet discovered of overcoming this  tendency to the selfish use of power, whether consciously or  unconsciously, by those possessing it, is the distribution of the power  among all who are its subjects. Short of this the name free government  is a misnomer.    This principle, after long strife, not yet entirely ended has been,  practically at least, very generally recognized on this side of the  Atlantic, as far as relates to men; but when the attempt is made to  extend it to women, political philosophers and practical politicians,  those \"inside of politics,\" two classes not often found acting in  concert, join in denouncing it. It remains to be determined whether the  reasons which have produced the extension of the franchise to all adult  men, do not equally demand its extension to all adult women. If it be  necessary for men that each should have a share in the administration of  government for his security, and to exclude partiality, as alleged by  Godwin, it would seem to be equally, if not more, necessary for women,  on account of their inferior physical power: and if, as is persistently  alleged by those who sneer at their claims, they are also inferior in  mental power, that fact only gives additional weight to the argument in  their behalf, as one of the primary objects of government, as  acknowledged on all hands, is the protection of the weak against the  power of the"]]]
