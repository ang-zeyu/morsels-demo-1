[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/216"],[0,"The Tao Teh King, or the Tao and its Characteristics (#4)"],[1,"is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from  which it rises).  Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,'  'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.'  Is not this  an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see  the foundation of their dignity?  So it is that in the enumeration of  the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it  answer the ends of a carriage.  They do not wish to show themselves  elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an  (ordinary) stone.      40.    1.       The movement of the Tao       By contraries proceeds;     And weakness marks the course       Of Tao's mighty deeds.    2. All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named);  that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named).      41. 1. Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao,  earnestly carry it into practice.  Scholars of the middle class, when  they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it.  Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh  greatly at it.  If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit  to be the Tao.    2. Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:--      'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack;     Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;     Its even way is like a rugged track.     Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;     Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes;     And he has most whose lot the least supplies.     Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;     Its solid truth seems change to undergo;     Its largest square doth yet no corner show     A vessel great, it is the slowest made;     Loud is its sound, but never word it said;     A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.'    3. The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is  skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them  complete.      42. 1. The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three;  Three produced All things.  All things leave behind them the Obscurity  (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the  Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised  by the Breath of Vacancy.    2. What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as  carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which  kings and princes use for themselves.  So it is that some things are  increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being  increased.    3. What other men (thus) teach, I also teach.  The violent and strong  do not die their natural death.  I will make this the basis of my  teaching.      43. 1. The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the  hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there  is no crevice.  I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing  (with a purpose).    2. There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without  words, and the advantage arising from non-action.      44.    1.       Or fame or life,       Which do you hold more dear?     Or life or wealth,       To which would you adhere?     Keep life and lose those other things;     Keep them and lose your life:--which brings       Sorrow and pain more near?    2.       Thus we may see,       Who cleaves to fame       Rejects what is more great;     Who loves large stores       Gives up the richer state.    3.       Who is content     Needs fear no shame.     Who knows to stop     Incurs no blame.     From danger free     Long live shall he.      45.    1.       Who thinks his great achievements poor     Shall find his vigour long endure.     Of greatest fulness, deemed a void,     Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide.     Do thou what's straight still crooked deem;     Thy greatest art still stupid seem,     And eloquence a stammering scream.    2. Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat.  Purity  and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven.      46. 1. When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift  horses to (draw) the dung-carts.  When the Tao is disregarded in the  world, the war-horses breed in the border lands.    2. There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity  greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than  the wish to be getting.  Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is  an enduring and unchanging sufficiency.      47. 1. Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes  place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees  the Tao of Heaven.  The farther that one goes out (from himself), the  less he knows.    2. Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave  their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished  their ends without any purpose of doing so.      48. 1. He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to  increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks)  from day to day to diminish (his doing).    2. He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing  nothing (on purpose).  Having arrived at this point of non-action,  there is nothing which he does not do.    3. He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself  no trouble (with that end).  If one take trouble (with that end), he  is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven.      49. 1. The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind  of the people his mind.    2. To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not  good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good.  To  those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are  not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be  sincere.    3. The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps  his mind in a state of indifference to all.  The people all keep their  eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his  children.      50. 1. Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die.    2. Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three  are ministers of death.    3. There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose  movements tend to the land (or place) of death.  And for what reason?  Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life.    4. But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life  entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun  rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff  coat or sharp weapon.  The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which  to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws,  nor the weapon a place to admit its point.  And for what reason?  Because there is in him no place of death.      51. 1. All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its  outflowing operation.  They receive their forms according to the  nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of  their condition.  Therefore all things without exception honour the  Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation.    2. This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the  result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute.    3. Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them,  brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures  them, maintains them, and overspreads them.    4. It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it  carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in  doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over  them;--this is called its mysterious operation.      52. 1. (The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be  considered as the mother of them all.    2. When the mother is found, we know what her children should be.  When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard  (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his  life he will be free from all peril.    3. Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his  nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion.  Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion  of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him.    4. The perception of what is small is (the secret of) clear-sightedness;  the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength.    5.       Who uses well his light,     Reverting to its (source so) bright,     Will from his body ward all blight,     And hides the unchanging from men's sight.      53. 1. If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position  to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should  be most afraid of would be a boastful display.    2. The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the  by-ways.    3. Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their  fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty.  They  shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their  girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a  superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called  robbers and boasters.  This is contrary to the Tao surely!      54.    1.       What (Tao's) skilful planter plants       Can never be uptorn;     What his skilful arms enfold,       From him can ne'er be borne.     Sons shall bring in lengthening line,     Sacrifices to his shrine.    2.       Tao when nursed within one's self,       His vigour will make true;     And where the family it rules       What riches will accrue!     The neighbourhood where it prevails       In thriving will abound;     And when 'tis seen throughout the state,       Good fortune will be found.

To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.    HOT WELL, April 18.    DEAR PHILLIPS,    I give Mansel credit for his invention, in propagating the report that I  had a quarrel with a mountebank's merry Andrew at Gloucester: but I have  too much respect for every appendage of wit, to quarrel even with the  lowest buffoonery; and therefore I hope Mansel and I shall always be  good friends. I cannot, however, approve of his drowning my poor  dog Ponto, on purpose to convert Ovid's pleonasm into a punning  epitaph,--deerant quoque Littora Ponto: for, that he threw him into the  Isis, when it was so high and impetuous, with no other view than to kill  the fleas, is an excuse that will not hold water--But I leave poor Ponto  to his fate, and hope Providence will take care to accommodate Mansel  with a drier death.    As there is nothing that can be called company at the Well, I am here  in a state of absolute rustication: This, however, gives me leisure to  observe the singularities in my uncle's character, which seems to have  interested your curiosity. The truth is, his disposition and mine,  which, like oil and vinegar, repelled one another at first, have now  begun to mix by dint of being beat up together. I was once apt to  believe him a complete Cynic; and that nothing but the necessity of his  occasions could compel him to get within the pale of society--I am now  of another opinion. I think his peevishness arises partly from bodily  pain, and partly from a natural excess of mental sensibility; for, I  suppose, the mind as well as the body, is in some cases endued with a  morbid excess of sensation.    I was t'other day much diverted with a conversation that passed in the  Pump-room, betwixt him and the famous Dr L--n, who is come to ply at the  Well for patients. My uncle was complaining of the stink, occasioned  by the vast quantity of mud and slime which the river leaves at low ebb  under the windows of the Pumproom. He observed, that the exhalations  arising from such a nuisance, could not but be prejudicial to the weak  lungs of many consumptive patients, who came to drink the water. The  Doctor overhearing this remark, made up to him, and assured him he was  mistaken. He said, people in general were so misled by vulgar prejudices  that philosophy was hardly sufficient to undeceive them. Then humming  thrice, he assumed a most ridiculous solemnity of aspect, and entered  into a learned investigation of the nature of stink. He observed,  that stink, or stench, meant no more than a strong impression on  the olfactory nerves; and might be applied to substances of the most  opposite qualities; that in the Dutch language, stinken signifies the  most agreeable perfume, as well as the most fetid odour, as appears in  Van Vloudel's translation of Horace, in that beautiful ode, Quis multa  gracilis, &c.--The words fiquidis perfusus odoribus, he translates van  civet & moschata gestinken: that individuals differed toto coelo in  their opinion of smells, which, indeed, was altogether as arbitrary  as the opinion of beauty; that the French were pleased with the putrid  effluvia of animal food; and so were the Hottentots in Africa, and the  Savages in Greenland; and that the Negroes on the coast of Senegal would  not touch fish till it was rotten; strong presumptions in favour of what  is generally called stink, as those nations are in a state of nature,  undebauched by luxury, unseduced by whim and caprice: that he had reason  to believe the stercoraceous flavour, condemned by prejudice as a stink,  was, in fact, most agreeable to the organs of smelling; for, that every  person who pretended to nauseate the smell of another's excretions,  snuffed up his own with particular complacency; for the truth of which  he appealed to all the ladies and gentlemen then present: he said, the  inhabitants of Madrid and Edinburgh found particular satisfaction  in breathing their own atmosphere, which was always impregnated with  stercoraceous effluvia: that the learned Dr B--, in his treatise on the  Four Digestions, explains in what manner the volatile effluvia from the  intestines stimulate and promote the operations of the animal economy:  he affirmed, the last Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Medicis family,  who refined upon sensuality with the spirit of a philosopher, was so  delighted with that odour, that he caused the essence of ordure to be  extracted, and used it as the most delicious perfume: that he himself  (the doctor) when he happened to be low-spirited, or fatigued with  business, found immediate relief and uncommon satisfaction from hanging  over the stale contents of a close-stool, while his servant stirred it  about under his nose; nor was this effect to be wondered at, when we  consider that this substance abounds with the self-same volatile salts  that are so greedily smelled to by the most delicate invalids, after  they have been extracted and sublimed by the chemists.--By this time the  company began to hold their noses; but the doctor, without taking  the least notice of this signal, proceeded to shew, that many fetid  substances were not only agreeable but salutary; such as assa foetida,  and other medicinal gums, resins, roots, and vegetables, over and above  burnt feathers, tan-pits, candle-snuffs, &c. In short, he used many  learned arguments to persuade his audience out of their senses; and from  stench made a transition to filth, which he affirmed was also a mistaken  idea, in as much as objects so called, were no other than certain  modifications of matter, consisting of the same principles that enter  into the composition of all created essences, whatever they may be: that  in the filthiest production of nature, a philosopher considered nothing  but the earth, water, salt and air, of which it was compounded; that,  for his own part, he had no more objections to drinking the dirtiest  ditch-water, than he had to a glass of water from the Hot Well, provided  he was assured there was nothing poisonous in the concrete. Then  addressing himself to my uncle, 'Sir (said he) you seem to be of a  dropsical habit, and probably will soon have a confirmed ascites: if  I should be present when you are tapped, I will give you a convincing  proof of what I assert, by drinking without hesitation the water  that comes out of your abdomen.'--The ladies made wry faces at this  declaration, and my uncle, changing colour, told him he did not desire  any such proof of his philosophy: 'But I should be glad to know (said  he) what makes you think I am of a dropsical habit?' 'Sir, I beg pardon  (replied the Doctor) I perceive your ancles are swelled, and you seem to  have the facies leucophlegmatica. Perhaps, indeed, your disorder may  be oedematous, or gouty, or it may be the lues venerea: If you have any  reason to flatter yourself it is this last, sir, I will undertake  to cure you with three small pills, even if the disease should have  attained its utmost inveteracy. Sir, it is an arcanum, which I have  discovered, and prepared with infinite labour.--Sir, I have lately cured  a woman in Bristol--a common prostitute, sir, who had got all the worst  symptoms of the disorder; such as nodi, tophi,"]]]
