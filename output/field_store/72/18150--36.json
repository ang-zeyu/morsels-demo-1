Not until more than forty years after the  attempt of Ponce de Leon did the expedition of the ferocious Menendez  effect a permanent establishment on the coast of Florida. In September,  1565, the foundations of the oldest city in the United States, St.  Augustine, were laid with solemn religious rites by the toil of the  first negro slaves; and the event was signalized by one of the most  horrible massacres in recorded history, the cold-blooded and perfidious  extermination, almost to the last man, woman, and child, of a colony of  French Protestants that had been planted a few months before at the  mouth of the St. John's River.    The colony thus inaugurated seemed to give every promise of permanent  success as a center of religious influence. The spiritual work was  naturally and wisely divided into the pastoral care of the Spanish  garrisons and settlements, which was taken in charge by \"secular\"  priests, and the mission work among the Indians, committed to friars of  those \"regular\" orders whose solid organization and independence of the  episcopal hierarchy, and whose keen emulation in enterprises of  self-denial, toil, and peril, have been so large an element of strength,  and sometimes of weakness, in the Roman system. In turn, the mission  field of the Floridas was occupied by the Dominicans, the Jesuits, and  the Franciscans. Before the end of seventy years from the founding of  St. Augustine the number of Christian Indians was reckoned at  twenty-five or thirty thousand, distributed among forty-four missions,  under the direction of thirty-five Franciscan missionaries, while the  city of St. Augustine was fully equipped with religious institutions and  organizations. Grave complaints are on record, which indicate that the  great number of the Indian converts was out of all proportion to their  meager advancement in Christian grace and knowledge; but with these  indications of shortcoming in the missionaries there are honorable  proofs of diligent devotion to duty in the creating of a literature of  instruction in the barbarous languages of the peninsula.    For one hundred and fifteen years Spain and the Spanish missionaries had  exclusive possession in Florida, and it was during this period that  these imposing results were achieved. In 1680 a settlement of Scotch  Presbyterians at Port Royal in South Carolina seemed like a menace to  the Spanish domination. It was wholly characteristic of the Spanish  colony to seize the sword at once and destroy its nearest Christian  neighbor. It took the sword, and perished by the sword. The war of races  and sects thus inaugurated went on, with intervals of quiet, until the  Treaty of Paris, in 1763, transferred Florida to the British crown. No  longer sustained by the terror of the Spanish arms and by subsidies from  the Spanish treasury, the whole fabric of Spanish civilization and  Christianization, at the end of a history of almost two centuries,  tumbled at once to complete ruin and extinction.    The story of the planting of Christian institutions in New Mexico runs  parallel with the early history of Florida. Omitting from this brief  summary the first discovery of these regions by fugitives from one of  the disastrous early attempts to effect a settlement on the Florida  coast, omitting (what we would fain narrate) the stories of heroic  adventure and apostolic zeal and martyrdom which antedate the permanent  occupation of the country, we note the arrival, in 1598, of a strong,  numerous, and splendidly equipped colony, and the founding of a  Christian city in the heart of the American continent. As usual in such  Spanish enterprises, the missionary work was undertaken by a body of  Franciscan friars. After the first months of hardship and  discouragement, the work of the Christian colony, and especially the  work of evangelization among the Indians, went forward at a marvelous  rate. Reinforcements both of priests and of soldiers were received from  Mexico; by the end of ten years baptisms were reported to the number of  eight thousand; the entire population of the province was reckoned as  being within the pale of the church; not less than sixty Franciscan  friars at once were engaged in the double service of pastors and  missionaries. The triumph of the gospel and of Spanish arms seemed  complete and permanent.    Fourscore years after the founding of the colony and mission the sudden  explosion of a conspiracy, which for a long time had been secretly  preparing, revealed the true value of the allegiance of the Indians to  the Spanish government and of their conversion to Christ. Confounding in  a common hatred the missionaries and the tyrannous conquerors, who had  been associated in a common policy, the Christian Indians turned upon  their rulers and their pastors alike with undiscriminating warfare. \"In  a few weeks no Spaniard was in New Mexico north of El Paso. Christianity  and civilization were swept away at one blow.\" The successful rebels  bettered the instruction that they had received from their rejected  pastors. The measures of compulsion that had been used to stamp out  every vestige of the old religion were put into use against the new.    The cause of Catholic Christianity in New Mexico never recovered from  this stunning blow. After twenty years the Spanish power, taking  advantage of the anarchy and depopulation of the province, had  reoccupied its former posts by military force, the missionaries were  brought back under armed protection, the practice of the ancient  religion was suppressed by the strong hand, and efforts, too often  unsuccessful, were made to win back the apostate tribes to something  more than a sullen submission to the government and the religion of  their conquerors. The later history of Spanish Christianity in New  Mexico is a history of decline and decay, enlivened by the usual  contentions between the \"regular\" clergy and the episcopal government.  The white population increased, the Indian population dwindled. Religion  as set forth by an exotic clergy became an object of indifference when  it was not an object of hatred. In 1845 the Bishop of Durango, visiting  the province, found an Indian population of twenty thousand in a total  of eighty thousand. The clergy numbered only seventeen priests. Three  years later the province became part of the United States.    To complete the story of the planting of Spanish Christianity within the  present boundaries of the United States, it is necessary to depart from  the merely chronological order of American church history; for, although  the immense adventurousness of Spanish explorers by sea and land had,  early in the sixteenth century, made known to Christendom the coasts and  harbors of the Californias, the beginnings of settlement and missions on  that Pacific coast date from so late as 1769. At this period the method  of such work had become settled into a system. The organization was  threefold, including (1) the garrison town, (2) the Spanish settlement,  and (3) the mission, at which the Indian neophytes were gathered under  the tutelage and strict government of the convent of Franciscan friars.  The whole system was sustained by the authority and the lavish  subventions of the Spanish government, and herein lay its strength and,  as the event speedily proved, its fatal weakness. The inert and feeble  character of the Indians of that region offered little excuse for the  atrocious cruelties that had elsewhere marked the Spanish occupation;  but the paternal kindness of the stronger race was hardly less hurtful.  The natives were easily persuaded to become by thousands the dependents  and servants of the missions. Conversion went on apace. At the end of  sixty-five years from the founding of the missions their twenty-one  stations numbered a Christian native population of more than thirty  thousand, and were possessed of magnificent wealth, agricultural and  commercial. In that very year (1834) the long-intended purpose of the  government to release the Indians from their almost slavery under the  missions, and to distribute the vast property in severalty, was put in  force. In eight years the more than thirty thousand Catholic Indians had  dwindled to less than five thousand; the enormous estates of the  missions were dissipated; the converts lapsed into savagery and  paganism.    Meanwhile the Spanish population had gone on slowly increasing. In the  year 1840, seventy years from the Spanish occupancy, it had risen to  nearly six thousand; but it was a population the spiritual character of  which gave little occasion of boasting to the Spanish church. Tardy and  feeble efforts had been instituted to provide it with an organized  parish ministry, when the supreme and exclusive control of that country  ceased from the hands that so long had held it. \"The vineyard was taken  away, and given to other husbandmen.\" In the year 1848 California was  annexed to the United States.    This condensed story of Spanish Christianity within the present  boundaries of the United States is absurdly brief compared with the vast  extent of space, the three centuries of time, and what seemed at one  time the grandeur of results involved in it. But in truth it has  strangely little connection with the extant Christianity of our country.  It is almost as completely severed from historical relation with the  church of the present day as the missions of the Greenlanders in the  centuries before Columbus. If we distinguish justly between the  Christian work and its unchristian and almost satanic admixtures, we can  join without reserve both in the eulogy and in the lament with which the  Catholic historian sums up his review: \"It was a glorious work, and the  recital of it impresses us by the vastness and success of the toil. Yet,  as we"]]]
