To  whitewash Catiline is a hopeless task; and it throws a lurid light upon  the political and moral sentiments of the time to find Cicero even  contemplating such a conjunction.    After this, for two years, there is a break in the correspondence.  Atticus had probably returned to Rome, and if there were letters to  others (as no doubt there were) they have been lost. A certain light is  thrown on the proceedings of the year of candidature (B.C. 64) by the  essay \"On the duties of a candidate,\" ascribed to his brother Quintus,  who was himself to be a candidate for the praetorship in the next year  (B.C. 63). We may see from this essay that Pompey was still regarded as  the greatest and most influential man at Rome; that Catiline's character  was so atrocious in the eyes of most, that his opposition was not to be  feared; that Cicero's \"newness\" was a really formidable bar to his  election, and that his chief support was to be looked for from the  individuals and companies for whom he had acted as counsel, and who  hoped to secure his services in the future. The support of the nobles  was not a certainty. There had been a taint of _popularity_ in some of  Cicero's utterances, and the writer urges him to convince the consulars  that he was at one with the Optimates, while at the same time aiming at  the conciliation of the equestrian order. This was, in fact, to be  Cicero's political position in the future. The party of the  Optimates--in spite of his disgust at the indifference and frivolity of  many of them--was to be his party: his favourite constitutional object  was to be to keep the equites and the senate on good terms: and his  greatest embarrassment was how to reconcile this position with his  personal loyalty to Pompey, and his views as to the reforms necessary in  the government of the provinces.    [Sidenote: The Consulship, B.C. 63.]    For the momentous year of the consulship we have no letters. His brother  Quintus was in Rome as candidate and then praetor-designate; Atticus was  also in Rome; and the business, as well as the dignity of a consul, were  against anything like ordinary correspondence. Of the earlier part of  the consulship we have little record. The speeches against Rullus were  delivered at the beginning of the year, and commit Cicero pretty  definitely to a policy as to the _ager publicus_--which was, to his  disgust, entirely reversed by the triumvirs in B.C. 59--but they do not  shew any sense of coming trouble. Cicero, however, throughout his  consulship took a very definite line against the _populares_. Not only  did he defend Rabirius Postumus, when accused by Caesar of the  assassination of Saturninus, and address the people against offering  violence to L. Roscius on account of the unpopular _lex theatralis_,[6]  but he even resisted the restoration to their civil rights of the sons  of the men proscribed by Sulla, avowedly on the ground of the necessity  of maintaining the established order, though he knew and confessed the  justice of the proposal.[6]    [Sidenote: The Conspiracy of Catiline.]    Any movement, therefore, on the side of the popular party had now his  opposition with which to reckon. He professes to have known very early  in his year of office that some more than usually dangerous movement was  in contemplation. We cannot well decide from the violent denunciation of  Catiline contained--to judge from extant fragments--in the speech _in  toga candida_, how far Cicero was really acquainted with any definite  designs of his. Roman orators indulged in a violence of language so  alien from modern ideas and habits, that it is difficult to draw  definite conclusions. But it appears from Sallust that Catiline had in a  secret meeting before the elections of B.C. 64, professed an intention  of going all lengths in a revolutionary programme and, if that was the  case, Cicero would be sure to have had some secret information on the  subject. But his hands were partly tied by the fact that the _comitia_  had given him a colleague--C. Antonius--deeply implicated in Catiline's  policy, whatever it was. Pompey, whom he regarded as the champion of law  and order, was in the East: and Catiline's candidature--and it was  supposed his policy also--had had the almost open support of the richest  man in Rome, M. Licinius Crassus, and of the most influential man of the  _populares_, C. Iulius Caesar. In the house of one or the other of them,  indeed, the meeting at which Catiline first unfolded his purposes was  believed to have been held. Still Catiline had not been guilty of any  overt act which enabled Cicero to attack him. He had, indeed, been  informed, on very questionable authority, that Catiline had made a plot  to assassinate him while holding the elections, and he made a  considerable parade of taking precautions for his safety--letting it be  seen that he wore a cuirass under his toga, and causing his house to be  guarded by the younger members of his party. The elections, according  to Plutarch, had at least been once postponed from the ordinary time in  July, though this has been denied.[7] At any rate it was not till they  had taken place and Catiline had been once more rejected, that any  definite step is alleged to have been taken by him, such as Cicero could  lay hold of to attack him. On the 20th of October, in the senate, Cicero  made a speech warning the Fathers of the impending danger, and on the  21st called upon Catiline for an explanation in their presence. But,  after all, even the famous meeting of the 5th of November, in the house  of M. Porcius Laeca, betrayed to Cicero by Fulvia, the mistress of Q.  Curius, would not have sufficed as grounds for the denunciation of the  first extant speech against Catiline (7th of November), if it had not  been for something else. For some months past there had been rumours of  risings in various parts of Italy; but by the beginning of November it  was known that C. Manlius (or Mallius) had collected a band of  desperadoes near Faesulae, and, having established there a camp on the  27th of October, meant to advance on Rome. Manlius had been a centurion  in Sulla's army, and had received an allotment of confiscated land in  Etruria; but, like others, had failed to prosper. The movement was one  born of discontent with embarrassments which were mostly brought about  by extravagance or incompetence. But the rapidity with which Manlius was  able to gather a formidable force round him seems to shew that there  were genuine grievances also affecting the agricultural classes in  Etruria generally. At any rate there was now no doubt that a formidable  disturbance was brewing; the senate voted that there was a _tumultus_,  authorized the raising of troops, and named commanders in the several  districts affected. It was complicity in this rising that Cicero now  sought to establish against Catiline and his partisans in Rome. The  report of the meeting in the house of Laeca gave him the pretext for his  first step--a fiery denunciation of Catiline in the senate on the 7th of  November. Catiline left Rome, joined the camp of Manlius, and assumed  the ensigns of _imperium_. That he was allowed thus to leave the city  is a proof that Cicero had as yet no information enabling him to act at  once. It was the right of every citizen to avoid standing a trial by  going into exile. Catiline was now under notice of prosecution for  _vis_, and when leaving Rome he professed to be going to Marseilles,  which had the _ius exilii_. But when it was known that he had stopped  short at Faesulae, the senate at once declared both him and Manlius  _hostes_, and authorized the consuls to proceed against them. The  expedition was intrusted to Antonius, in spite of his known sympathy  with Catiline, while Cicero was retained with special powers to protect  the city. The result is too well known to be more than glanced at here.  Catiline's partisans were detected by letters confided to certain envoys  of the Allobroges, which were held to convict them of the guilt of  treason, as instigating Catiline to march on Rome, and the senate of the  Allobroges to assist the invasion by sending cavalry to Faesulae.    [Sidenote: Execution of the conspirators, December, B.C. 63. Its legal  grounds and consequences.]    The decree of the senate, _videant consules, etc._, had come to be  considered as reviving the full _imperium_ of the consul, and investing  him with the power of life and death over all citizens. Cicero acted on  this (questionable) constitutional doctrine. He endeavoured, indeed, to  shelter himself under the authority of a senatorial vote. But the senate  never had the power to try or condemn a citizen. It could only record  its advice to the consul. The whole legal responsibility for the  condemnation and death of the conspirators, arrested in consequence of  these letters, rested on the consul. To our moral judgment as to  Cicero's conduct it is of primary importance to determine whether or not  these men were guilty: to his legal and constitutional position it  matters not at all. Nor was that point ever raised against him. The  whole question turns on whether the doctrine was true that the _senatus  consultum ultimum_ gave the consul the right of inflicting death upon  citizens without trial, _i.e._, without appeal to the people, on the  analogy of the dictator _seditionis sedandae causa_, thus practically  defeating that most ancient and cherished safeguard of Roman liberty,  the _ius provocationis_. The precedents were few, and scarcely such as  would appeal to popular approval. The murder of Tiberius Gracchus had  been _ex post facto_ approved by the senate in B.C. 133-2. In the case  of Gaius Gracchus, in B.C. 121, the senate had voted _uti consul Opimius  rempublicam defenderet_, and in virtue of that the consul had authorized  the killing of Gaius and his friends: thus for the first time exercising  _imperium sine"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21254"],[0,"In Africa: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country (#4)"],[1," the officer had been in London having a good time while  a sergeant-major attended to the sending of the biannual letter. I  suppose the officer divided his pay with the sergeant-major. If he did  not he was a most ungrateful man.    The _Adolph Woermann_ is a German ship and is one of the best ones that  go down the east coast. Its passengers go to the British ports in  British East Africa, to the German ports in German East Africa, and to  several other ports in South Africa. Consequently the passengers are  about equally divided between the English and the Germans, with an  occasional Portuguese bound for Delagoa Bay or Mozambique.    When we first went aboard our party of four desired to secure a table by  ourselves. We were unsuccessful, however, and found it shared by a  peaceful old gentleman with whiskers. By crossing with gold the palm of  the chief steward, the old gentleman was shifted to a seat on the first  officer's right. Later we discovered that he was Sir Thomas Scanlon, the  first premier of South Africa, the man who gave Cecil Rhodes his start.    There were many interesting elements which made the cruise of the  _Woermann_ unusual. Mr. Boyce and his party of six were on board and  were on their way to photograph East Africa. They took moving pictures  of the various deck sports, also a bird's-eye picture of the ship, taken  from a camera suspended by a number of box kites, and also gave two  evenings of cinematograph entertainment.    There were also poker games, bridge games, and other forms of seaside  sports, all of which contributed to the gaiety of life in the Indian  Ocean. In the evening one might have imagined oneself at a London  music-hall, in the daytime at the Olympian games, and in the early  morning out on the farm. There were a number of chickens on board and  each rooster seemed obliged to salute the dawn with a fanfare of  crowing. They belonged to the governor and were going out to East Africa  to found a colony of chickens. Some day, years hence, the proud  descendents of these chickens will boast that their ancestors came over  on the _Woermann_, just as some people boast about their ancestors on  the _Mayflower_.    [Drawing: _Mauled by a Lion_]    When we crossed the equator, a committee of strong-arm men baptized  those of the passengers who had never before crossed the line. Those who  had crossed the line entered into the fun of the occasion with much  spirit and enthusiasm.    On the hottest day of the trip, just as we left Suez, when the mercury  was sputtering from the heat, we heard that the north pole had been  discovered. It cooled us off considerably for a while.          CHAPTER III    THE ISLAND OF MOMBASA, WITH THE JUNGLES OF EQUATORIAL AFRICA \"ONLY A FEW  BLOCKS AWAY.\" A STORY OF THE WORLD'S CHAMPION MAN-EATING LIONS      In this voyage of the _Woermann_ there were about twenty Englishmen and  thirty Germans in the first class, not including women, and children.  There was practically no communication between the two nationalities,  which seemed deeply significant in these days when there is so much talk  of war between England and Germany. Each went his way without so much as  a \"good morning\" or a _guten abend_. And it was not a case of  unfamiliarity with the languages, either, that caused this mutual  restraint, for most of the Germans speak English. It was simply an  evidence that at the present time there is decidedly bad feeling between  the two races, and if it is a correct barometer of conditions in Europe,  there is certain to be war one of these days. On the _Woermann_, we only  hoped that it would not break out while the weather was as hot as it was  at that time.    The Germans are not addicted to deck sports while voyaging about, and it  is quite unusual to find on German ships anything in the way of deck  competition. The German, while resting, prefers to play cards, or sing,  or sit in his long easy chair with the children playing about. The  Englishman likes to compete in feats of strength and takes to deck  sports as a duck takes to water. I don't know who started it, but some  one organized deck sports on the _Woermann_, and after we left Aden the  sound of battle raged without cessation. Some of the competitions were  amusing. For instance, there was the cockfight. Two men, with hands and  knees hobbled with a stick and stout rope, seat themselves inside a  circle, and the game is for each one to try to put the other outside the  circle. Neither can use his hands.    [Drawing: _The Cock Fight_]    It is like wrestling in a sitting position with both hands tied, the  mode of attack being to topple over one's opponent and then bunt him out  of the circle. There is considerable skill in the game and a fearful lot  of hard work. By the time the victor has won, the seat of the trousers  of each of the two contending heroes has cleaned the deck until it  shines--the deck, not the trousers.    In a similar way the deck is benefited by the \"are you there\" game. Two  men are blindfolded, armed with long paper clubs, and then lie at full  length on the deck, with left hands clasped. One then says, \"Are you  there?\" and when the other answers, \"I am,\" he makes a wild swat at  where he thinks the other's head to be. Of course, when the man says \"I  am,\" he immediately gets his head as far away from where it was when he  spoke as is possible while clasping his opponent's hand. The \"Are you  there\" man makes a wild swing and lands some place with a prodigious  thump. He usually strikes the deck and seldom hits the head of the other  man. If one of them hits the other's head three times he wins. In the  meantime the deck has been thoroughly massaged by the two recumbent  heroes as they have moved back and forth in their various offensive and  defensive manoeuvers.    [Drawing: \"_Are You There?_\"]    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. A Study in Mombasa Shadows]    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. Mombasa Is a Pretty Place]    [Photograph: Transportation in Mombasa]    [Drawing: _The Spar and Pillow Fight_]    The pillow fight on the spar is the most fun. Two gladiators armed with  pillows sit astride a spar and try to knock each other off. It requires  a good deal of knack to keep your balance while some one is pounding you  with a large pillow. You are not allowed to touch the spar with your  hands, hence the difficulty of holding a difficult position. When a man  begins to waver the other redoubles his attack, and slowly at first, but  surely, the defeated gladiator tumbles off the spar into a canvas  stretched several feet below. It is lots of fun, especially for the  spectator and the winner.    Then, of course, there were other feats of intellectual and physical  prowess in the _Woermann_ competition, such as threading the needle,  where you run across the deck, thread a needle held by a woman, and then  drag her back to the starting point. The woman usually, in the  excitement of the last spirited rush, falls over and is bodily dragged  several yards, squealing wildly and waving a couple of much agitated  deck shoes, and so forth.    Similar to this contest is the one where the gentleman dashes across the  deck with several other equally dashing gentlemen, kneels at the feet of  a woman who ties his necktie and then lights his cigarette. The game is  to see who can do this the quickest and get back to the starting place  first. If you have ever tried to light a cigarette in a terrible hurry  and on a windy deck, you will appreciate the elements of uncertainty in  the game.    These deck sports served to amuse and divert during the six days on the  Indian Ocean, and then the ship's chart said that we were almost at  Mombasa. The theoretical stage of the lion hunt was nearly over and it  was now a matter of only a few days until we should be up against the  \"real thing.\" I sometimes wondered how I should act with a hostile lion  in front of me--whether I would become panic-stricken or whether my  nerve would hold true. There is lots of food for reverie when one is  going against big game for the first time.    [Drawing: _Chalking the Pig's Eye_]    We landed at Mombasa September sixteenth, seventeen days out from  Naples.    Mombasa is a little island about two by three miles in extent. It is  riotous with brilliant vegetation, and, as seen after a long sea voyage  through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, it looks heavenly except for  the heat. Hundreds of great baobab trees with huge, bottle-like trunks  and hundreds of broad spreading mango trees give an effect of tropical  luxuriance that is hardly to be excelled in beauty anywhere in the East.  Large ships that stop at the island usually wind their course through a  narrow channel and land their passengers and freight at the dock at  Kilindini, a mile and a half from the old Portuguese town of Mombasa,  where all the life of the island is centered. There are many relics of  the old days around the town of Mombasa and the port of Kilindini, but  since the British have been in possession a brisk air of progress and  enterprise is evident everywhere. Young men and young women in tennis  flannels, and other typical symptoms of British occupation are  constantly seen, and one entirely forgets that one is several thousand  miles from home and only a few blocks from the jungles of equatorial  Africa. We dreaded Mombasa before we arrived, but were soon agreeably  disappointed to find it not only beautiful and interesting, but also  pleasantly cool and full of most hospitable social life.    When our ship anchored off Kilindini there was a great crowd assembled  on the pier. There were many smart looking boats, manned with uniformed  natives, that at once came out to the ship, and we knew that the town  was _en fete_ to welcome the newly appointed governor, Sir Percy  Girouard.    He and his staff landed in full uniform. There were addresses of welcome  at the pier, a great deal of"]]]
