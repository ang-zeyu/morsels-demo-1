Hostjoghon repeated the same ceremony over the invalid. There was a  constant din of rattle and chanting, the gods disappeared, and immediately  thereafter the theurgist gathered the twelve wands from the base of the  sweat house. He removed the blue reed from the basket and laid it a little  to the left of the priest of the sweat house, who in turn handed it to an  attendant to be deposited with the wood of the sweat house in a  neighboring tree. The invalid proceeded to the medicine lodge followed by  the song-priest uttering a low chant. After entering the lodge the invalid  took his seat on the west side; the song-priest, still standing, took from  a small buckskin bag white powdered material which he rubbed on the soles  of the feet, palms, knees, breast, shoulders, and head of the invalid;  then taking a pinch of the same material he extended his hand first toward  the east and then toward the heavens and the earth. After these attentions  he took his accustomed seat in the lodge and joined in conversation with  his attendants.                                  [Illustration]          SECOND CEREMONY.      Two sheepskins, a blanket, and cotton cloth were spread one upon the other  in front of the song-priest; and from the long reeds that had been first  rubbed with a polishing stone, then with tobacco, were cut ten pieces an  inch and a quarter long and two pieces 2 inches long. These were colored  black and blue, one long piece and five small ones being black, the others  blue. While these were being decorated the song-priest and choir sang \"My  fathers, see, we are getting ready! We do our work well, and you would  better go into the house for we are to have rain! Now, mothers, send down  rain upon us!\" This song was constantly repeated.    The tubes when completed were laid in position to form a dual person. The  long black tube representing the body was first placed in position. The  long blue tube was then laid by its side and south of it. The pollen end  of the tubes pointed to the east. The right black leg was the next placed  in position, then the right blue leg, the left black leg and left blue  leg. The right black arm, then the right blue arm, the left black arm and  the left blue arm, then the black head and the blue head. (See PI. CXV.)    These tubes were filled with feathers, balls, and tobacco, and tipped with  the corn pollen and lighted with the crystal, the black tubes being  offerings to the gods, the blue to the goddesses. After they were  completed they were placed in position by a second attendant; and while  the tubes were being filled the song-priest and choir sang \"See, fathers!  We fill these with tobacco; it is good; smoke it!\" A message was received  from the fathers that they would smoke, and, puffing the smoke from their  mouths, they would invoke the watering of the earth. They again sang \"All  you people who live in the rocks, all you who are born among the clouds,  we wish you to help us; we give you these offerings that you may have food  and a smoke! All women, you who live in the rocks, you who are born among  the fog, I pray you come and help us; I want you to come and work over the  sick; I offer to you food of humming-birds' plumes, and tobacco to smoke!\"  Two bunches of feathers which had been placed to the east side of the rug  pointing east were deposited in two corn husks, each husk containing bits  of turquoise, black archaic beads, and abalone shell; corn pollen was  sprinkled on these. The song-priest then placed the dual body in the husks  thus: First, the black body was laid upon the husks to the north, and upon  this a pinch of pollen was sprinkled; the blue body was placed in the  other husks and pollen sprinkled upon it; then the two right legs (black  and blue) were put into the corn husks with the black body; the two left  legs were added to the same; the right and left arms and the two heads  were placed in the husk with the blue body and corn pollen sprinkled upon  them. The husks were closed and held by the song-priest to the soles of  the feet, palms, knees, breast, shoulders, back, and top of head of the  invalid, who repeated a long prayer after the theurgist, and the parcels  were given to an attendant, who carried them some distance from the lodge  to the north and placed them in a secluded shady spot upon the ground. Two  bits of tobacco were laid upon the ground and upon these the body was  placed, the figure in a recumbent position with the arms over the head.  The invalid for whom this ceremony was held spared no expense in having  the theurgist make the most elaborate explanation to his near relatives of  the secrets of the medicine tubes.                                  [Illustration]                                CEREMONIAL MASKS.          THIRD CEREMONY.      The theurgist occupied his usual seat, surrounded by his corps of  attendants. The man personating Naiyenesgony had his body and limbs  painted black. The legs below the knee, the scapula, the breasts, and the  arm above the elbow were painted white. His loins were covered with a fine  red silk scarf, held by a silver belt; his blue knit stockings were tied  with red garters below each knee, and quantities of coral, turquois, and  white shell beads ornamented the neck. The man representing Tobaidischinni  had his body colored reddish brown, with this figure                      [Illustration: scalp knot symbol]  (the scalp knot) in white on the outside of each leg below the knee, on  each arm below the shoulder, each scapula, and on each breast. This design  represents the knot of hair cut from the heads of enemies, and the style  is still in use by the Navajo. The man wore a red woolen scarf around the  loins, caught on by a silver belt, and his neck was profusely ornamented  with coral, turquois, and white beads.(1) Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni  left the lodge, carrying with them their masks. (See Pl. cxv, 1, 2, 3.)  Bunches of pine boughs, which during the forenoon had been made into  wreaths by joining pieces together with yucca in this fashion were                      [Illustration: scalp knot symbol]  laid across each end of the rug.    After the two men personating the gods left the lodge the invalid entered  and took his seat on the rug with his back to the theurgist. Two  attendants dressed him with the wreaths, beginning with the right ankle; a  piece was then tied around the calf, thigh, waist, around the chest, right  wrist, elbow, upper arm, throat, forehead, then around the upper left arm,  elbow, wrist, thigh, left knee, calf, and ankle. Thus the man was  literally obscured with a mass of pine. He sat in an upright position with  the legs extended and arms falling by his sides. A chant was sung by the  song priest, and in a few minutes Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni  appeared. Naiyenesgony drew his stone knife in front of the invalid over  the forehead to the feet, then down the right side and down the back and  down the left side. He then began to remove the pine. As each wreath was  taken off the clusters were partly separated with the stone knife.  Tobaidischinni assisted Naiyenesgony by holding the wreaths while they  were being cut.    When all the evergreen had been removed the personators of the gods  exclaimed, \"Now, my people, we have killed all enemies!\" and immediately  left the lodge. The song priest placed a small wreath of the pine on the  sick man's head, and holding in his left hand a bunch of eagle plumes, and  in his right hand a rattle, he sang the ten songs and prayers, assisted by  the choir, that were given by Naiyenesgony and Tobaidischinni to the  Navajo to bring health and good fortune. After the pine-bough wreaths had  been separated the bits of yucca-strings were picked up by the attendant  and handed to Naiyenesgony, who held them over the sick man's head, after  which the bits were again divided with the knife. After the ten songs and  prayers had been chanted the invalid left the rug and sat a little to the  northeast, of it, with his knees drawn up. The song priest placed two live  coals in front of the invalid and sprinkled chopped herbs on the coals,  the fumes of which the invalid inhaled. The pines were carried off and  placed in the shade of a pine tree, that the disease might not leave the  pine and return to the invalid.(2)          FOURTH CEREMONY.      The personators of Hasjelti and Hostjoghon adorned themselves for the  ceremony. Hasjelti wore ordinary clothing and a red scarf, with a silver  belt around the waist. Hostjoghon's body was painted white, and he wore a  red woolen scarf around the loins, caught on with a silver belt. A rug,  composed of a blanket and a piece of white cotton, was spread in front of  the song priest, and the masks of Hasjelti and Hostjoghon placed thereon.  (See Pl. CXV, 4,5,6.)    Upon the completion of the toilets of the personators of the gods they  hurried from the lodge, bearing their masks with them, when an attendant  made a cavity immediately in front of the rug 4 inches in diameter, and  the song priest sprinkled a circle of meal around the cavity. The invalid  entered the lodge and stood on the rug and removed all of his clothing  except the breech cloth. He then took his seat facing east, with knees  drawn up. A mask of the Hostjobokon, which had been laid upon the rug, was  drawn over the invalid's head. Hasjelti and Hostjoghon appeared at this  juncture bearing a pine bough some 5 feet in height. An attendant made  gestures over the sick man, holding in his right hand a pinch of sacred  meal, which was afterward placed in the cavity. Hasjelti waved the pine  bough five times around the invalid and planted it in the cavity, where it  was held in place by the gods. Then bending its top, the attendant  attached it to the mask over the invalid's head by a buckskin string which  was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#4)"],[1,"irts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he  drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like  a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,  keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His  body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking  through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.    Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had  never believed it until now.    No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through  and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling  influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the  folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not  observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his  senses.    \"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. \"What do you want  with me?\"    \"Much!\"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.    \"Who are you?\"    \"Ask me who I _was_.\"    \"Who _were_ you, then?\" said Scrooge, raising his voice. \"You're  particular, for a shade.\" He was going to say \"_to_ a shade,\" but  substituted this, as more appropriate.    \"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\"    \"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.    \"I can.\"    \"Do it, then.\"    Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so  transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt  that, in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the  necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the  opposite side of the fire-place, as if he were quite used to it.    \"You don't believe in me,\" observed the Ghost.    \"I don't,\" said Scrooge.    \"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own  senses?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.    \"Why do you doubt your senses?\"    \"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them. A slight disorder  of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,  a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.  There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\"    Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in  his heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be  smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his  terror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.    To sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,  would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something  very awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal  atmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was  clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its  hair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour  from an oven.    \"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,  for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a  second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.    \"I do,\" replied the Ghost.    \"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.    \"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\"    \"Well!\" returned Scrooge, \"I have but to swallow this, and be for the  rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own  creation. Humbug, I tell you; humbug!\"    At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such  a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,  to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his  horror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it  were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its  breast!    Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.    \"Mercy!\" he said. \"Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\"    \"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or  not?\"    \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and  why do they come to me?\"    [Illustration: _To sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence,  for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him._]    \"It is required of every man,\" the Ghost returned, \"that the spirit  within him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and  wide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do  so after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is  me!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,  and turned to happiness!\"    Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its  shadowy hands.    \"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling. \"Tell me why?\"    \"I wear the chain I forged in life,\" replied the Ghost. \"I made it link  by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free-will, and of my  own free-will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?\"    Scrooge trembled more and more.    \"Or would you know,\" pursued the Ghost, \"the weight and length of the  strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this,  seven Christmas-eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a  ponderous chain!\"    Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding  himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable, but he  could see nothing.    \"Jacob!\" he said imploringly. \"Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak  comfort to me, Jacob!\"    \"I have none to give,\" the Ghost replied. \"It comes from other regions,  Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of  men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all  permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.  My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my  spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;  and weary journeys lie before me!\"    It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his  hands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he  did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.    \"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\" Scrooge observed in a  business-like manner, though with humility and deference.    \"Slow!\" the Ghost repeated.    \"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge. \"And travelling all the time?\"    \"The whole time,\" said the Ghost. \"No rest, no peace. Incessant torture  of remorse.\"    \"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.    \"On the wings of the wind,\" replied the Ghost.    \"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,\"  said Scrooge.    The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so  hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have  been justified in indicting it for a nuisance.    \"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,\" cried the phantom, \"not to know  that ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth  must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is  all developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in  its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too  short for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of  regret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such  was I! Oh, such was I!\"    \"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,\" faltered Scrooge,  who now began to apply this to himself.    \"Business!\" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. \"Mankind was my  business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,  forbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my  trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my  business!\"    It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were the cause of all  its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.    \"At this time of the rolling year,\" the spectre said, \"I suffer most.  Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,  and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a  poor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have  conducted _me_?\"    Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this  rate, and began to quake exceedingly.    \"Hear me!\" cried the Ghost. \"My time is nearly gone.\"    \"I will,\" said Scrooge. \"But don't be hard upon me! Don't be flowery,  Jacob! Pray!\"    \"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may  not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.\"    It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the  perspiration from his brow.    \"That is no light part of my penance,\" pursued the Ghost. \"I am here  to-night to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my  fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\"    \"You were always a good friend to me,\" said Scrooge. \"Thankee!\"    \"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by Three Spirits.\"    Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.    \"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?\" he demanded in a  faltering voice.    \"It is.\"    \"I--I think I'd rather not,\" said Scrooge.    \"Without their visits,\" said the Ghost, \"you cannot hope to shun the  path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow when the bell tolls One.\"    \"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?\" hinted  Scrooge.    \"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third, upon  the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.  Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember  what has passed between us!\"    When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the  table, and bound it round its head as before. Scrooge knew this by the  smart sound its"]]]
