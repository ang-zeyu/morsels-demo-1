The account we received of his life  and character from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as  something extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine.  \"Had he died on the same day,\" you said, \"one might have supposed a  transmigration.\"        [7] January 17, new style. This change in the calendar      was made in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, and adopted in      England in 1752. Every year whose number in the common      reckoning since Christ is not divisible by 4, as well as      every year whose number is divisible by 100 but not by      400, shall have 365 days, and all other years shall have      366 days. In the eighteenth century there was a      difference of eleven days between the old and the new      style of reckoning, which the English Parliament      canceled by making the 3rd of September, 1752, the 14th.      The Julian calendar, or \"old style,\" is still retained      in Russia and Greece, whose dates consequently are now      13 days behind those of other Christian countries.    John was bred a dyer, I believe of woollens, Benjamin was bred a silk  dyer, serving an apprenticeship at London. He was an ingenious man. I  remember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father in  Boston, and lived in the house with us some years. He lived to a  great age. His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston. He left  behind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting of  little occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of  which the following, sent to me, is a specimen.[8] He had formed a  short-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I  have now forgot it. I was named after this uncle, there being a  particular affection between him and my father. He was very pious, a  great attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in  his short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them. He was also  much of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station. There fell  lately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the  principal pamphlets relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717;  many of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but  there still remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto  and in octavo. A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by  my sometimes buying of him, he brought them to me. It seems my uncle  must have left them here when he went to America, which was about  fifty years since. There are many of his notes in the margins.        [8] The specimen is not in the manuscript of the      _Autobiography_.    This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and  continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were  sometimes in danger of trouble on account of their zeal against  popery. They had got an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it,  it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a  joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he  turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then  under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice  if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual  court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet,  when the Bible remained concealed under it as before. This anecdote I  had from my uncle Benjamin. The family continued all of the Church of  England till about the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of  the ministers that had been outed for non-conformity, holding  conventicles[9] in Northamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to  them, and so continued all their lives: the rest of the family  remained with the Episcopal Church.        [9] Secret gatherings of dissenters from the established      Church.    [Illustration: Birthplace of Franklin. Milk Street, Boston.]    Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three  children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been  forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable  men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was  prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy  their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four  children more born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all  seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his  table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the  youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston,  New England.[10] My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger,  daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of  whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather,[11] in his church  history of that country, entitled _Magnalia Christi Americana_, as \"_a  godly, learned Englishman_,\" if I remember the words rightly. I have  heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of  them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in  1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people, and addressed to  those then concerned in the government there. It was in favour of  liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, Quakers, and  other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian  wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that  persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an  offense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The whole  appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and  manly freedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I have  forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was,  that his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he would  be known to be the author.      \"Because to be a libeller (says he)      I hate it with my heart;    From Sherburne town,[12] where now I dwell      My name I do put here;    Without offense your real friend,      It is Peter Folgier.\"        [10] Franklin was born on Sunday, January 6, old style,      1706, in a house on Milk Street, opposite the Old South      Meeting House, where he was baptized on the day of his      birth, during a snowstorm. The house where he was born      was burned in 1810.--Griffin.        [11] Cotton Mather (1663-1728), clergyman, author, and      scholar. Pastor of the North Church, Boston. He took an      active part in the persecution of witchcraft.        [12] Nantucket.    My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was  put to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending  to devote me, as the tithe[13] of his sons, to the service of the  Church. My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been  very early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the  opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good  scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin,  too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-hand  volumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would  learn his character.[14] I continued, however, at the grammar-school  not quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the  middle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and farther was  removed into the next class above it, in order to go with that into  the third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from  a view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a  family he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated  were afterwards able to obtain--reasons that he gave to his friends in  my hearing--altered his first intention, took me from the  grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic,  kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in  his profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under  him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the  arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken  home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a  tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, but  had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dyeing  trade would not maintain his family, being in little request.  Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles, filling  the dipping mould and the moulds for cast candles, attending the shop,  going of errands, etc.        [13] Tenth.        [14] System of short-hand.    I disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my  father declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much  in and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; and  when in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to  govern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions  I was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into  scrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early  projecting public spirit, tho' not then justly conducted.    There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge  of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much  trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a  wharf there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large  heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh,  and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the  evening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my  playfellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets,  sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built  our little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at  missing the stones, which were"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],[0,"The Mind and Its Education (#4)"],[1,"oment, and the make-up of the stream changes in a  flash. Hero, heroine, or literary style no longer occupies the wave.  They forfeit their place, the wave is taken by the bodily sensations,  and we are conscious of the smarting eyes and shivering body, while  these in turn give way to the next object which occupies the wave. Figs.  1-3 illustrate these changes.    [Illustration: FIG. 3]    CONSCIOUSNESS LIKENED TO A FIELD.--The consciousness of any moment has  been less happily likened to a field, in the center of which there is an  elevation higher than the surrounding level. This center is where  consciousness is piled up on the object which is for the moment foremost  in our thought. The other objects of our consciousness are on the margin  of the field for the time being, but any of them may the next moment  claim the center and drive the former object to the margin, or it may  drop entirely out of consciousness. This moment a noble resolve may  occupy the center of the field, while a troublesome tooth begets  sensations of discomfort which linger dimly on the outskirts of our  consciousness; but a shooting pain from the tooth or a random thought  crossing the mind, and lo! the tooth holds sway, and the resolve dimly  fades to the margin of our consciousness and is gone.    THE \"PILING UP\" OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS ATTENTION.--This figure is not so  true as the one which likens our mind to a stream with its ever onward  current answering to the flow of our thought; but whichever figure we  employ, the truth remains the same. Our mental energy is always piled up  higher at one point than at others. Either because our interest leads  us, or because the will dictates, the mind is withdrawn from the  thousand and one things we might think about, and directed to this one  thing, which for the time occupies chief place. In other words, we  _attend_; for this piling up of consciousness is nothing, after all, but  attention.      3. CONTENT OF THE MENTAL STREAM    We have seen that our mental life may be likened to a stream flowing now  faster, now slower, ever shifting, never ceasing. We have yet to inquire  what constitutes the material of the stream, or what is the stuff that  makes up the current of our thought--what is the _content_ of  consciousness? The question cannot be fully answered at this point, but  a general notion can be gained which will be of service.    WHY WE NEED MINDS.--Let us first of all ask what mind is for, why do  animals, including men, have minds? The biologist would say, in order  that they may _adapt_ themselves to their environment. Each individual  from mollusc to man needs the amount and type of mind that serves to  fit its possessor into its particular world of activity. Too little mind  leaves the animal helpless in the struggle for existence. On the other  hand a mind far above its possessor's station would prove useless if not  a handicap; a mollusc could not use the mind of a man.    CONTENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS DETERMINED BY FUNCTION.--How much mind does man  need? What range and type of consciousness will best serve to adjust us  to our world of opportunity and responsibility? First of all we must  _know_ our world, hence, our mind must be capable of gathering  knowledge. Second, we must be able to _feel_ its values and respond to  the great motives for action arising from the emotions. Third, we must  have the power to exert self-compulsion, which is to say that we possess  a _will_ to control our acts. These three sets of processes, _knowing_,  _feeling_, and _willing_, we shall, therefore, expect to find making up  the content of our mental stream.    Let us proceed at once to test our conclusion by introspection. If we  are sitting at our study table puzzling over a difficult problem in  geometry, _reasoning_ forms the wave in the stream of consciousness--the  center of the field. It is the chief thing in our thinking. The fringe  of our consciousness is made up of various sensations of the light from  the lamp, the contact of our clothing, the sounds going on in the next  room, some bit of memory seeking recognition, a \"tramp\" thought which  comes along, and a dozen other experiences not strong enough to occupy  the center of the field.    But instead of the study table and the problem, give us a bright  fireside, an easy-chair, and nothing to do. If we are aged,  _memories_--images from out the past--will probably come thronging in  and occupy the field to such extent that the fire burns low and the room  grows cold, but still the forms from the past hold sway. If we are  young, visions of the future may crowd everything else to the margin of  the field, while the \"castles in Spain\" occupy the center.    Our memories may also be accompanied by emotions--sorrow, love, anger,  hate, envy, joy. And, indeed, these emotions may so completely occupy  the field that the images themselves are for the time driven to the  margin, and the mind is occupied with its sorrow, its love, or its joy.    Once more, instead of the problem or the memories or the \"castles in  Spain,\" give us the necessity of making some decision, great or small,  where contending motives are pulling us now in this direction, now in  that, so that the question finally has to be settled by a supreme effort  summed up in the words, _I will_. This is the struggle of the will which  each one knows for himself; for who has not had a raging battle of  motives occupy the center of the field while all else, even the sense of  time, place and existence, gave way in the face of this conflict! This  struggle continues until the decision is made, when suddenly all the  stress and strain drop out and other objects may again have place in  consciousness.    THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL PHASES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--Thus we see that if we  could cut the stream of consciousness across as we might cut a stream of  water from bank to bank with a huge knife, and then look at the cut-off  section, we should find very different constituents in the stream at  different times. We should at one time find the mind manifesting itself  in _perceiving_, _remembering_, _imagining_, _discriminating_,  _comparing_, _judging_, _reasoning_, or the acts by which we gain our  knowledge; at another in _fearing_, _loving_, _hating_, _sorrowing_,  _enjoying_, or the acts of feeling; at still another in _choosing_, or  the act of the will. These processes would make up the stream, or, in  other words, these are the acts which the mind performs in doing its  work. We should never find a time when the stream consists of but one of  the processes, or when all these modes of mental activity are not  represented. They will be found in varying proportions, now more of  knowing, now of feeling, and now of willing, but some of each is always  present in our consciousness. The nature of these different elements in  our mental stream, their relation to each other, and the manner in which  they all work together in amazing perplexity yet in perfect harmony to  produce the wonderful _mind_, will constitute the subject-matter we  shall consider together in the pages which follow.      4. WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS RESIDES    I--the conscious self--dwell somewhere in this body, but where? When my  finger tips touch the object I wish to examine, I seem to be in them.  When the brain grows weary from overstudy, I seem to be in it. When the  heart throbs, the breath comes quick, and the muscles grow tense from  noble resolve or strong emotion, I seem to be in them all. When, filled  with the buoyant life of vigorous youth, every fiber and nerve is  a-tingle with health and enthusiasm, I live in every part of my  marvelous body. Small wonder that the ancients located the soul at one  time in the heart, at another in the pineal gland of the brain, and at  another made it coextensive with the body!    CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.--Later science has  taught that the _mind resides in and works through the nervous system,  which has its central office in the brain_. And the reason why _I_ seem  to be in every part of my body is because the nervous system extends to  every part, carrying messages of sight or sound or touch to the brain,  and bearing in return orders for movements, which set the feet a-dancing  or the fingers a-tingling. But more of this later.    This partnership between mind and body is very close. Just how it  happens that spirit may inhabit matter we may not know. But certain it  is that they interact on each other. What will hinder the growth of one  will handicap the other, and what favors the development of either will  help both. The methods of their cooeperation and the laws that govern  their relationship will develop as our study goes on.      5. PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATION AND INTROSPECTION    One should always keep in mind that psychology is essentially a  laboratory science, and not a text-book subject. The laboratory material  is to be found in ourselves and in those about us. While the text should  be thoroughly mastered, its statements should always be verified by  reference to one's own experience, and observation of others. Especially  should prospective teachers constantly correlate the lessons of the book  with the observation of children at work in the school. The problems  suggested for observation and introspection will, if mastered, do much  to render practical and helpful the truths of psychology.    1. Think of your home as you last left it. Can you see vividly just how  it looked, the color of the paint on the outside, with the familiar form  of the roof and all; can you recall the perfume in some old drawer, the  taste of a favorite dish, the sound of a familiar voice in farewell?    2. What illustrations have you observed where the mental content of the  moment seemed chiefly _thinking_ (knowledge process); chiefly _emotion_  (feeling process); chiefly _choosing_, or self-compulsion (willing  process)?    3.
