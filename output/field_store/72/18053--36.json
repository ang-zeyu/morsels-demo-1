At Cotta, qui cogitasset haec posse  in itinere accidere atque ob eam causam profectionis auctor non fuisset,  nulla in re communi saluti deerat et in appellandis cohortandisque  miLtibus imperatoris et in pugna militis officia praestabat. Cum propter  longitudinem agminis minus facile omnia per se obire et, quid quoque  loco faciendum esset, providere possent, iusserunt pronuntiare, ut  impedimenta relinquerent atque in orbem consisterent. Quod consilium  etsi in eiusmodi casu reprehendendum non est, tarmen incommode accidit:  nam et nostris militibus spem minuit et hostes ad pugnam alacriores  effecit, quod non sine summo timore et desperatione id factum videbatur.  Praeterea accidit, quod fieri necesse erat, ut vulgo milites ab signis  discederent, quae quisque eorum carissima haberet, ab impedimentis  petere atque arripere properaret, clamore et fletu omnia complerentur.      34    At barbaris consilium non defuit. Nam duces eorum tota acie pronuntiare  iusserunt, ne quis ab loco discederet: illorum esse praedam atque illis  reservari quaecumque Romani reliquissent: proinde omnia in victoria  posita existimarent. Erant et virtute et studio pugnandi pares; nostri,  tametsi ab duce et a fortuna deserebantur, tamen omnem spem salutis in  virtute ponebant, et quotiens quaeque cohors procurrerat, ab ea parte  magnus numerus hostium cadebat. Qua re animadversa Ambiorix pronuntiari  iubet, ut procul tela coniciant neu propius accedant et, quam in partem  Romani impetum fecerint, cedant (levitate armorum et cotidiana  exercitatione nihil eis noceri posse), rursus se ad signa recipientes  insequantur.      35    Quo praecepto ab eis diligentissime observato, cum quaepiam cohors ex  orbe excesserat atque impetum fecerat, hostes velocissime refugiebant.  Interim eam partem nudari necesse erat et ab latere aperto tela recipi.  Rursus cum in eum locum unde erant egressi reverti coeperant, et ab eis  qui cesserant et ab eis qui proximi steterant circumveniebantur; sin  autem locum tenere vellent, nec virtuti locus relinquebatur, neque ab  tanta multitudine coniecta tela conferti vitare poterant. Tamen tot  incommodis conflictati, multis vulneribus acceptis resistebant et magna  parte diei consumpta, cum a prima luce ad horam octavam pugnaretur,  nihil quod ipsis esset indignum committebant. Tum Tito Balventio, qui  superiore anno primum pilum duxerat, viro forti et magnae auctoritatis,  utrumque femur tragula traicitur; Quintus Lucanius, eiusdem ordinis,  fortissime pugnans, dum circumvento filio subvenit, interficitur; Lucius  Cotta legatus omnes cohortes ordinesque adhortans in adversum os funda  vulneratur.      36    His rebus permotus Quintus Titurius, cum procul Ambiorigem suos  cohortantem conspexisset, interpretem suum Gnaeum Pompeium ad eum mittit  rogatum ut sibi militibusque parcat. Ille appellatus respondit: si velit  secum colloqui, licere; sperare a multitudine impetrari posse, quod ad  militum salutem pertineat; ipsi vero nihil nocitum iri, inque eam rem se  suam fidem interponere. Ille cum Cotta saucio communicat, si videatur,  pugna ut excedant et cum Ambiorige una colloquantur: sperare ab eo de  sua ac militum salute impetrari posse. Cotta se ad armatum hostem iturum  negat atque in eo perseverat.      37    Sabinus quos in praesentia tribunos militum circum se habebat et  primorum ordinum centuriones se sequi iubet et, cum propius Ambiorigem  accessisset, iussus arma abicere imperatum facit suisque ut idem faciant  imperat. Interim, dum de condicionibus inter se agunt longiorque  consulto ab Ambiorige instituitur sermo, paulatim circumventus  interficitur. Tum vero suo more victoriam conclamant atque ululatum  tollunt impetuque in nostros facto ordines perturbant. Ibi Lucius Cotta  pugnans interficitur cum maxima parte militum. Reliqui se in castra  recipiunt unde erant egressi. Ex quibus Lucius Petrosidius aquilifer,  cum magna multitudine hostium premeretur, aquilam intra vallum proiecit;  ipse pro castris fortissime pugnans occiditur. Illi aegre ad noctem  oppugnationem sustinent; noctu ad unum omnes desperata salute se ipsi  interficiunt. Pauci ex proelio lapsi incertis itineribus per silvas ad  Titum Labienum legatum in hiberna perveniunt atque eum de rebus gestis  certiorem faciunt.      38    Hac victoria sublatus Ambiorix statim cum equitatu in Aduatucos, qui  erant eius regno finitimi, proficiscitur; neque noctem neque diem  intermittit pedita tumque subsequi iubet. Re demonstrata Aduatucisque  concitatis postero die in Nervios pervenit hortaturque, ne sui in  perpetuum liberandi atque ulciscendi Romanos pro eis quas acceperint  iniuriis occasionem dimittant: interfectos esse legatos duos magnamque  partem exercitus interisse demonstrat; nihil esse negoti subito  oppressam legionem quae cum Cicerone hiemet interfici; se ad eam rem  profitetur adiutorem. Facile hac oratione Nerviis persuadet.      39    Itaque confestim dimissis nuntiis ad Ceutrones, Grudios, Levacos,  Pleumoxios, Geidumnos, qui omnes sub eorum imperio sunt, quam maximas  manus possunt cogunt et de improviso ad Ciceronis hiberna advolant  nondum ad eum fama de Tituri morte perlata. Huic quoque accidit, quod  fuit necesse, ut nonnulli milites, qui lignationis munitionisque causa  in silvas discessissent, repentino equitum adventu interciperentur. His  circumventis magna manu Eburones, Nervii, Aduatuci atque horum omnium  socii et clientes legionem oppugnare incipiunt. Nostri celeriter ad arma  concurrunt, vallum conscendunt. Aegre is dies sustentatur, quod omnem  spem hostes in celeritate ponebant atque hanc adepti victoriam in  perpetuum se fore victores confidebant.      40    Mittuntur ad Caesarem confestim ab Cicerone litterae magnis propositis  praemiis, si pertulissent: obsessis omnibus viis missi intercipiuntur.  Noctu ex materia, quam munitionis causa comportaverant, turres admodum  CXX excitantur incredibili celeritate; quae deesse operi videbantur,  perficiuntur. Hostes postero die multo maioribus coactis copiis castra  oppugnant, fossam complent. Eadem ratione, qua pridie, ab nostris  resistitur. Hoc idem reliquis deinceps fit diebus. Nulla pars nocturni  temporis ad laborem intermittitur; non aegris, non vulneratis facultas  quietis datur. Quaecumque ad proximi diei oppugnationem opus sunt noctu  comparantur; multae praeustae sudes, magnus muralium pilorum numerus  instituitur; turres contabulantur, pinnae loricaeque ex cratibus  attexuntur. Ipse Cicero, cum tenuissima valetudine esset, ne nocturnum  quidem sibi tempus ad quietem relinquebat, ut ultro militum concursu ae  vocibus sibi parcere cogeretur.      41    Tunc duces principesque Nerviorum qui aliquem cermonis aditum causamque  amicitiae cum Cicerone habebant colloqui sese velle dicunt. Facta  potestate eadem quae Ambiorix cum Titurio egerat commemorant: omnem esse  in armis Galliam; Germanos Rhenum transisse; Caesaris reliquorumque  hiberna oppugnari. Addunt etiam de Sabini morte: Ambiorigem ostentant  fidei faciendae causa. Errare eos dicunt, si quidquam ab his praesidi  sperent, qui suis rebus diffidant; sese tamen hoe esse in Ciceronem  populumque Romanum animo, ut nihil nisi hiberna recusent atque hanc  inveterascere consuetudinem nolint: licere illis incolumibus per se ex  hibernis discedere et quascumque in partes velint sine metu proficisci.  Cicero ad haec unum modo respondit: non esse consuetudinem populi Romani  accipere ab hoste armato condicionem: si ab armis discedere velint, se  adiutore utantur legatosque ad Caesarem mittant; sperare pro eius  iustitia, quae petierint, impetraturos.      42    Ab hac spe repulsi Nervii vallo pedum IX et fossa pedum XV hiberna  cingunt. Haec et superiorum annorum consuetudine ab nobis cognoverant  et, quos clam de exercitu habebant captivos, ab eis docebantur; sed  nulla ferramentorum copia quae esset ad hunc usum idonea, gladiis  caespites circumcidere, manibus sagulisque terram exhaurire nitebantur.  Qua quidem ex re hominum multitudo cognosci potuit: nam minus horis  tribus milium pedum XV in circuitu munitionem perfecerunt reliquisque  diebus turres ad altitudinem valli, falces testudinesque, quas idem  captivi docuerant, parare ac facere coeperunt.      43    Septimo oppugnationis die maximo coorto vento ferventes fusili ex  argilla glandes fundis et fervefacta iacula in casas, quae more Gallico  stramentis erant tectae, iacere coeperunt. Hae celeriter ignem  comprehenderunt et venti magnitudine in omnem locum castrorum  distulerunt. Hostes maximo clamore sicuti parta iam atque explorata  victoria turres testudinesque agere et scalis vallum ascendere  coeperunt. At tanta militum virtus atque ea praesentia animi fuit, ut,  cum undique flamma torrerentur maximaque telorum multitudine premerentur  suaque omnia impedimenta atque omnes fortunas conflagrare intellegerent,  non modo demigrandi causa de vallo decederet nemo, sed paene ne  respiceret quidem quisquam, ac tum omnes acerrime fortissimeque  pugnarent. Hic dies nostris longe gravissimus fuit; sed tamen hunc  habuit eventum, ut eo die maximus numerus hostium vulneraretur atque  interficeretur, ut se sub ipso vallo constipaverant recessumque primis  ultimi non dabant.

The visible island is but a symbol of the submarine mountain.  The present mental impression is but proof of a great bulk of past  experiences.    And so we might carry on the figure and compare the birth of  consciousness to the instant of appearance of the mountain top above the  water's surface. It is not a new bit of land. It is only emerging into a  new world.    \"But,\" you ask, \"do you mean to assert that the baby's mind is a  finished product at birth; that coming into life is simply the last  stage of its growth? How unconvincing your theory is.\"    No, we only now have the soil for consciousness. The island and the  submarine mountain are different things. The sea-floor is transformed  when it enters into the new element. An entirely different vegetation  takes place on this visible island than took place on the floor of the  sea before it emerged. But the only new elements added to the hitherto  submerged land come from the new atmosphere, and the sea-floor  immediately begins to become a very different thing. Nevertheless, what  it is as an island is now, and forever will be due, primarily, to its  structure as a submarine mountain. In the new atmosphere the soil is  changed, new chemical elements enter in, seeds are brought to it by the  four winds--and it is changed. But it is still the sea-floor  transformed.    Just so the baby brain, complete in parts and mechanism at birth, is a  different brain with every day of growth in its new environment, with  every contact with the external world. But it is, primarily and in its  elements, the brain evolved through thousands of centuries of pushing up  to man's level through the sea of animal life, and hundreds of centuries  more of the development of man's brain to its present complete mechanism  through experience with constantly changing environment.    Hence, when the baby sees light and responds by tightly shutting his  eyes, then later by opening them to investigate, his sensation is what  it is because through the aeons of the past man has established a  certain relation to light through experiencing it. To go further than  this, and to find the very beginning, how the first created life came to  respond to environment at all, is to go beyond the realm of the actually  known. But that he did once _first_ experience his environment, and  establish a reaction that is now racial, we know.    So our baby soon shows certain \"instinctive\" reactions. He reaches out  to grasp. He sucks, he cries, he looks at light and bright objects in  preference to dark, he is carrying out the history of his race, but is  making it personal. He has evolved a new life, but all his ancestors  make its foundation. The personal element, added to his heritage, has  made him different from any and all of his forebears. But he can have no  consciousness except as a bit from the vast inherited accumulation of  the past of his ancestors, of all the race, steps forth to meet a new  environment.    And again you ask, \"How came the first consciousness?\"    And again I answer, \"It is as far back as the first created or evolved  organism which could respond in any way to a material world; and only  metaphysics and the God behind metaphysics can say.\"    We only know that careful laboratory work in psychology--experiments on  the unconscious--today prove that our conscious life is what it is,  because of: _first_, what is stored away in the unconscious (_i. e._,  what all our past life and the past life of the race has put there);  _second_, because of what we have accepted from our environment; and  this comprises our material, intellectual, social, and spiritual  environment.      CONSCIOUSNESS IS COMPLEX    The one fact we want at this stage of our inquiry is simply this: that  consciousness, awaking at birth, very soon becomes complex. However  single and simple in content immediate consciousness may be, it is so  intimately linked with all preceding experience that a pure sensation is  probably never known after the first second of life. As the sensation is  registered it becomes a basis for comparison. That first sensation,  perhaps, was just a feeling of _something_. The next is a feeling of  something that is the same, or is not the same, as the first. So  immediately perception is established. The baby consciousness recognizes  that the vague feeling is, or is not, _that same thing_. And from  perception to a complex consciousness of perceptions, of ideas, of  memories and relations, and judgments, is so short a step that we cannot  use our measuring rods to span it.    Thus through the various stages of life, from infancy to maturity, the  conscious is passing into the unconscious, only to help form later a new  conscious thought. Hence the conscious thought is determined by the  great mass of the unconscious, plus the external world.    But every thought, relegated to the unconscious, through its association  there--for it is plastic by nature--comes back to consciousness never  quite the same, and meets never quite the same stimulus. And as a result  a repeated mental experience is never twice exactly the same. So the  conscious becomes the unconscious and the unconscious the conscious, and  neither can be without the other.    Our problem is to understand the workings of the mind as it exists  today, and to try to find some of its most constructive uses; and on  that we shall focus attention. To that end we must first examine the  various ways in which consciousness expresses itself.    We have recognized two distinct mental states--the conscious and the  unconscious--and have found them constantly pressing each on the other's  domain. Our study of consciousness reveals the normal in the aspects of  sleeping and waking, also various abnormal states. Consciousness may  become excited, depressed, confused, delirious, or insane. We shall  consider later some of the mental workings that account for these  abnormal expressions. At present let us examine the mind's activities in  sleep and in delirium.      CONSCIOUSNESS IN SLEEP    Sleep seldom, if ever, is a condition of utter unconsciousness. We so  frequently have at least a vague recollection, when we wake, of  dreaming--whether or not we remember the dream material--that we are  inclined to accept sleep as always a state of some kind of mental  activity, though waking so often wipes the slate clean. A new word which  serves our purpose well has come into common use these last years, and  we describe sleep as a state of rest of the conscious mind made possible  as weariness overpowers the _censor_, and this guard at the gate naps.  The censor is merely that mental activity which forces the mind to keen,  alert, constructive attention during our waking hours, a guard who  _censors_ whatever enters the conscious mind and compares it with  reality, forcing back all that is not of immediate use, or that is  undesirable, or that contradicts established modes of life or thought.  In sleep we might say that the censor, wearied by long vigilance,  presses all the material--constantly surging from the unconscious into  consciousness, there to meet and establish relations with matter--back  into the unconscious realms, and locks the door, and lies and slumbers.  Then the half-thoughts, the disregarded material, the unfit, the  unexpressed longings or fears, the forbidden thoughts; in fact, the  whole accumulation of the disregarded or forgotten, good, bad, and  indifferent--for the unconscious has no moral sense--seize their  opportunity. The guard has refused to let them pass. He is now asleep.  And the more insistent of them pick the lock and slip by, masquerading  in false characters, and flit about the realms of the sleeping  consciousness as ghosts in the shelter of darkness. If the guard  half-wakes he sleepily sees only legitimate forms; for the dreams are  well disguised. His waking makes them scurry back, sometimes leaving no  trace of their lawless wanderings. So the unconscious thoughts of the  day have become sleep-consciousness by play acting.      CONSCIOUSNESS IN DELIRIUM    At this time of our study it will suffice to say that in delirium and in  insanity, which we might very broadly call a prolonged delirium, the  toxic brain becomes a house in disorder. The censor is sick, and  sequence and coherence are lost as the thronging thoughts of the  unconscious mind press beyond the portals into consciousness, disordered  and confused. We shall later find, however, that this very disorder  falls into a sort of order of its own, and a dominant emotion of pain or  ecstasy, of depression or fear, of exaltation or depreciation calls  steadily upon the stored away incidents and remembered, related  feelings of the past and interprets them as present reality. The censor  of the sick brain is stupefied by toxins, shock, or exhaustion, and the  citadel he is supposed to guard is thronged with besiegers from every  side. The strongest--_i. e._, those equipped with most associations  pertinent to the emotional status at the time--win out, occupy the brain  by force, and demand recognition and expression from all the senses,  deluding them by their guise of the reality of external matter.    We find consciousness, then, determined by all past experience, by an  external world, and by its organ of expression--the _brain_.    Consequently, our psychology leads us into anatomy and physiology,  which, probably, we have already fairly mastered. In rapid review, only,  in the following chapter we shall consider the organs of man's  consciousness, the brain, spinal cord, and the senses, and try to  establish some relation between the material body and its mighty  propelling force--the _mind_.          CHAPTER III    ORGANS OF CONSCIOUSNESS      Nothing is known to us until it has been transmitted to the mind by  the senses. The nerves"]]]
