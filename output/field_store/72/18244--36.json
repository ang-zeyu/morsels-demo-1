CONCLUDING WORDS                                             409            WOMAN: HER SEX AND LOVE LIFE      CHAPTER ONE    THE PARAMOUNT NEED OF SEX KNOWLEDGE FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN     Why Sex Knowledge is of Paramount Importance to Girls and    Women--Reasons Why a Misstep in a Girl Has More Serious    Consequences than a Misstep in a Boy--The Place Love Occupies in    Woman's Life--Woman's Physical Disabilities.      All are agreed--I mean all who are capable of thinking and have given  the subject some thought--that for the welfare of the race and for his  own physical and mental welfare it is important that the boy be given  some sex instruction. All are not agreed as to the character of the  instruction, its extent, the age at which it should be begun and as to  who the teacher should be--the father, the family physician, the  school teacher or a specially prepared book--but as to the necessity  of sex knowledge for the boy there is now substantial agreement--among  the conservatives as well as among the radicals.    No such agreement exists concerning sex knowledge for the girl. Many  still are the men and women--and not among the conservatives only--who  are strongly opposed to girls receiving any instruction in sex  matters. Some say that such instruction--except a few hygienic rules  about menstruation--is unnecessary, because the sex instinct awakens  in girls comparatively late, and it is time enough for them to learn  about such matters after they are married. Others fear that sex  knowledge would destroy the mystery and romance of sex, and would rob  our maidens of their greatest charms--modesty and innocence. Still  others fear that sex instruction would tend to awaken the sex instinct  in our girls prematurely; would direct their thoughts to matters about  which they would not think otherwise; and they argue that the warnings  about venereal disease, prostitution, etc., which are an integral part  of sex instruction, tend to create a cynical, inimical attitude  towards the male sex, which may even result in hypochondriac ideas and  antagonism to marriage.    I do not deny that there is a grain of truth in all the above  objections. Sex instruction does cause _some_ girls to think of sex  matters earlier than they otherwise would, and some girls have been  made bitter and hypochondriac, and disgusted with the male sex. But it  would not be difficult to demonstrate that it was not sex instruction  _per se_ that was responsible for these deplorable results; it was the  _wrong_ kind of instruction that was to blame--it was the wrong  emphasis, the lurid exaggerations that caused the mischief, and not  the truth. In other words, it is not sex information, it is sex  misinformation, that is pernicious. And, of course, to this everybody  will agree: rather than false information, better no information at  all.    But if the information to be imparted be sane, honest and truthful,  without exaggerating the evils and without laying undue emphasis on  the dark shadows of our sex life, then the results can be only  beneficent. And the task I have put before myself in this book is to  give our girls and women sane, square and honest information about  their sex organs and sex nature, information absolutely free from  luridness, on the one hand, and maudlin sentimentality, on the other.  The female sex is in need of such information, much more so than is  the male sex. Yes, if boys, as is now universally agreed, are in need  of sex instruction, then girls are much more in need of it. Why? For  several important reasons.    The first reason why sex instruction is even more important for girls  than it is for boys is because a misstep in a girl has much more  disastrous consequences than it has in a boy. The disastrous results  of a misstep in a boy are only physical in character; the results of  the _same_ misstep in a girl may be physical, moral, social and  economic. To speak more plainly. If a boy, through ignorance, rashly  indulges in illicit sexual relations, the worst consequence to him may  be infection with a venereal disease. But he is not considered  immoral, he is not despised, he is not ostracized, he does not lose  his social standing in the slightest degree, and when he is cured of  his venereal disease he has no difficulty in getting married. He does  not even have to conceal his past sexual history from his wife. But if  a girl makes a misstep the consequences to her are terrible indeed; it  may not only cost her her health and social standing, she may have to  pay with her very life. She runs the risk of venereal infection the  same as the boy does, but in addition she runs the risk of becoming  pregnant, which in our present social system is a catastrophe indeed.  To save herself from the disgrace of an illegitimate child she may  have an abortion produced; the abortion may have no bad results, but  it may, if performed bunglingly, leave her an invalid for life, or it  may kill her outright. If she is so unfortunate as to be unable to get  anybody to produce an abortion, she gives birth to an illegitimate  child, which she is forced in most cases to put away in an institution  of some sort where she hopes and prays it may die soon--and, in  general, it does. If it does not die, she has for the rest of her life  a Damocles' sword hanging over her head, and she is in constant terror  lest her sin be found out. She does not permit herself to look for a  mate, but if she does get married, the specter of her antematrimonial  experience is constantly before her eyes. After years and years of  married life, the husband may divorce her if he finds out that she had  \"sinne"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21880"],[0,"The Medallic History of the United States of America 1776-1876 (#4)"],[1,"eleven o'clock.         Saturday, January 3, 1789.    In the following month, Mr. Jefferson again wrote to M. Dupre,      (p. xx)  inclosing descriptions of the designs for the medals of General Morgan  and of Admiral Jones. The reader will note some slight differences  between these and those originally composed by the Academy of  Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres:        To        M. DUPRE,           Engraver of Medals and Medallist of the               Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture.         Mr. Jefferson has the honour to send to M. Dupre the devices for       the medals for General Morgan and Rear-Admiral Paul Jones, which       he has just received from the Academy of Belles-Lettres, and the       making of which he proposes to M. Dupre, the latter to be       responsible for the success of the dies up to the striking of       three hundred and fifty of each medal in gold, silver, or bronze,       and to furnish proofs in tin at the end of the month of March       next, so that the medals may all be struck before the 15th of       April. He begs him to kindly mention the conditions on which he       will undertake them, and Mr. Jefferson will have the honour to       reply on receipt of them.         February 13, 1789.           _Medal for General Morgan, of twenty-four lignes in diameter._         The general, at the head of his army, charges the enemy, which       takes to flight.         _Legend_: VICTORIA LIBERTATIS VINDEX.         _Exergue_: FUGATIS CAPTIS AUT CAESIS AD COWPENS HOSTIBUS 17 Jan.       1781.         _Reverse_: America, recognizable by her shield, rests her left       hand upon a trophy of arms and of flags, and with her right       crowns the general, who bends before her.         _Legend_: DANIELI MORGAN DUCI EXERCITUS.         _Exergue_: COMITIA AMERICANA.           _Medal for Rear-Admiral John Paul Jones, of twenty-four       (p. xxi)       lignes._         _Device_: His head (M. Houdon will furnish the bust in plaster).         _Legend_: JOANNI PAULO JONES CLASSIS PRAEFECTO.         _Exergue_: COMITIA AMERICANA.         _Reverse_: Naval Engagement.         _Legend_: HOSTIUM NAVIBUS CAPTIS AUT FUGATIS.         _Exergue_: AD ORAM SCOTIAE 23 SEPT. 1779.    The following, from the same to the same, bearing date February 15,  1789, throws some light on the prices of the medals engraved by M.  Dupre:         To         M. DUPRE,            Engraver of Medals, Paris.         Mr. Jefferson has the honour to observe to M. Dupre that he pays       only twenty-four hundred _livres_ to M. Duvivier or to M.       Gatteaux for medals which measure twenty-four _lignes_, that he       paid the same sum to M. Dupre himself for that of General Greene,       and that recently M. Dupre asked no higher price for that of       General Morgan. Mr. Jefferson cannot, therefore, consent to give       more. For that sum he would expect to have the best work of M.       Dupre and not that of inferior artists. As regards time, perhaps       it may be possible to prolong it somewhat in regard to the medal       for Admiral Paul Jones, that officer being at present in Europe.       Mr. Jefferson will have the honour to await M. Dupre's answer,       and will be happy to conclude this arrangement with him.[9]         February 15, 1789.                       [Footnote 9: For the French original see F, page                     xlv.]    It is to be supposed that Dupre accepted these conditions, since he is  the engraver of the John Paul Jones medal, one of the finest specimens  in our collection. The Daniel Morgan piece is no less remarkable as an  effort of numismatic skill. The fight at the Cowpens, on the reverse,  is a striking example of the boldness with which Dupre enlarged   (p. xxii)  the limits of his art, and, in defiance of all traditional rules,  successfully represented several planes in the background.    I cannot do better than to give the opinion, concerning this and the  other of Dupre's American medals, of M. Charles Blanc,[10] from whom I  quote freely in the following:                       [Footnote 10: INSTITUT DE FRANCE--ACADEMIE DES                     BEAUX-ARTS _Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages                     d'Augustin Dupre, Graveur-General des Monnoies de                     la Republique. Lue dans la seance trimestrielle des                     cinq classes de l'Institut, le 26 Octobre, 1870,                     par M. Charles Blanc_.]    The Morgan medal, says this eminent French critic, seems to vibrate  beneath the rush of cavalry and the tread of infantry flying in the  background, indicated by the almost imperceptible lines of the metal  where the smoke of the cannonade is vanishing away in air. In the  Libertas Americana medal, which recalls, if we except the evacuation  of Boston, the two most memorable events of the War of Independence,  namely, the capitulation of General Burgoyne, at Saratoga, in October,  1777, and that of General Lord Cornwallis, at Yorktown, in October,  1781, Dupre has represented the new-born Liberty, sprung from the  prairies without ancestry and without rulers, as a youthful virgin,  with disheveled hair and dauntless aspect, bearing across her shoulder  a pike, surmounted by the Phrygian cap. This great artist, in  consequence of his intimacy with Franklin, had conceived the greatest  enthusiasm for the cause of the United States. Franklin resided at  Passy, and Dupre at Auteuil. As they both went to Paris every day,  they met and made acquaintance on the road--an acquaintance which soon  ripened into friendship. Dupre first engraved Franklin's seal with the  motto, \"_In simplici salus_,\" and afterward his portrait. This   (p. xxiii)  portrait presents an _alto-rilievo_ which is well adapted for medals  only; it is conceived in the spirit of the French school, which has  always attached great importance to the truthful rendering of flesh.  The artist has indicated the flat parts, the relaxation of the  muscles, and, as it were, the quivering of the flesh, so as to convey  an exact idea of the age of the model. He has conscientiously  represented the lines which the finger of Time imprints on the  countenance, but, above all, he has given us with wonderful fidelity  the physiognomy of the American sage, his shrewd simplicity, his  sagacity, and his expression of serene uprightness. A Latin hexameter  from the pen of Turgot became the well-known legend of this medal:  \"_Eripuit coelo fulmen, sceptrumque tyrannis._\"    The four pieces executed by Duvivier are no less remarkable for beauty  and excellence of workmanship. They all figured at the exhibitions of  the members of the Royal Academy of Paris, that of the Chevalier de  Fleury, as mentioned before, in the exhibition of 1781, and those of  of General and of Lieutenant-Colonel Washington, and Lieutenant-Colonel  Howard, in that of 1789.[11]                       [Footnote 11: See G, page xlv.]    In those by Gatteaux, the personification of America as an Indian  queen with an alligator at her feet is noteworthy.    With the exception of the Treaty of Commerce medal (1822), and perhaps  of that of Captain Truxtun, our medals after the War of Independence  were engraved and struck at home. Before that time, indeed, the one  voted in 1779 to Major Henry Lee had been made by John Wright, of  Philadelphia. From the close of the eighteenth century down to    (p. xxiv)  1840 John Reich and subsequently Moritz Fuerst were the engravers of  the national medals. Reich's works are valued; unfortunately they are  few in number. They consist of the medal voted in 1805 to Captain  Edward Preble for his naval operations against Tripoli, of another  voted in 1813 to Captain Isaac Hull for the capture of the British  frigate Guerriere, and of those of Presidents Jefferson and Madison.  That of President Jefferson especially deserves attention for its  beauty.    But little can be said in commendation of the works of Fuerst, whose  numerous medals are very inferior to Reich's, and still less worthy of  being compared with those of the French engravers. While wishing to  avoid undue severity, I cannot but endorse the opinion of General  Scott, given in a communication addressed to the Honorable William L.  Marcy, Secretary of War, in regard to the medal voted to General  Zachary Taylor, for victories on the Rio Grande:         To the Honourable                  HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,          William L. MARCY,                    Washington, July 25, 1846.             Secretary of War.         As medals are among the surest monuments of history, as well as       muniments of individual distinction, there should be given to       them, besides intrinsic value and durability of material, the       utmost grace of design, with the highest finish in mechanical       execution. All this is necessary to give the greater or       adventitious value; as in the present instance, the medal is to       be, at once, an historical record and a reward of distinguished       merit. The credit of the donor thus becomes even more than that       of the receiver interested in obtaining a perfect specimen in the       fine arts.         The within resolution prescribes _gold_ as the material of the       medal. The general form (circular) may be considered as equally       settled by our own practice, and that of most nations, ancient       and modern. There is, however, some little diversity in       _diameter_ and _thickness_ in the medals heretofore ordered   (p. xxv)       by Congress, at different periods, as may be seen in the cabinets       of the War and Navy Departments. Diversity in dimensions is even       greater in other countries.         The specific character of the medal is shown by its two faces, or       the _face_ and the _reverse_. The within resolution directs       appropriate devices and inscriptions thereon.         For the _face_, a bust likeness is needed, to give, with the name   "]]]
