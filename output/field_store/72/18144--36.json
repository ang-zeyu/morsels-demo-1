But without any  wash of color, such an outline is the most valuable of all means for  obtaining such memoranda of any scene as may explain to another  person, or record for yourself, what is most important in its  features.    27. Choose, then, a subject that interests you; and so far as failure  of time or materials compels you to finish one part, or express one  character, rather than another, of course dwell on the features that  interest you most. But beyond this, forget, or even somewhat repress  yourself, and make it your first object to give a true idea of the  place to other people. You are not to endeavor to express your own  feelings about it; if anything, err on the side of concealing them.  What is best is not to think of yourself at all, but to state as  plainly and simply as you can the whole truth of the thing. What you  think unimportant in it may to another person be the most touching  part of it: what you think beautiful may be in truth commonplace and  of small value. Quietly complete each part to the best of your power,  endeavoring to maintain a steady and dutiful energy, and the tranquil  pleasure of a workman.          II.    LIGHT AND SHADE.      28. In my last Lecture I laid before you evidence that the greatness  of the master whom I wished you to follow as your only guide in  landscape depended primarily on his studying from Nature always with  the point; that is to say, in pencil or pen outline. To-day I wish to  show you that his preeminence depends secondarily on his perfect  rendering of form and distance by light and shade, before he admits a  thought of color.    I say \"before\" however--observe carefully--only with reference to the  construction of any given picture, not with reference to the order in  which he learnt his mechanical processes. From the beginning, he  worked out of doors with the point, but indoors with the brush; and  attains perfect skill in washing flat color long before he attains  anything like skill in delineation of form.    29. Here, for instance, is a drawing, when he was twelve or thirteen  years old, of Dover Castle and the Dover Coach; in which the future  love of mystery is exhibited by his studiously showing the way in  which the dust rises about the wheels; and an interest in drunken  sailors, which materially affected his marine studies, shown not less  in the occupants of the hind seat. But what I want you to observe is  that, though the trees, coach, horses, and sailors are drawn as any  schoolboy would draw them, the sky is washed in so smoothly that few  water-color painters of our day would lightly accept a challenge to  match it.    And, therefore, it is, among many other reasons, that I put the brush  into your hands from the first, and try you with a wash in lampblack,  before you enter my working class. But, as regards the composition of  his picture, the drawing is always first with Turner, the color  second.    30. Drawing: that is to say, the expression by gradation of light,  either of form or space. Again I thus give you a statement wholly  adverse to the vulgar opinion of him. You will find that statement  early in the first volume of \"Modern Painters,\" and repeated now  through all my works these twenty-five years, in vain. Nobody will  believe that the main virtue of Turner is in his drawing. I say \"the  main virtue of Turner.\" Splendid though he be as a colorist, he is not  unrivaled in color; nay, in some qualities of color he has been far  surpassed by the Venetians. But no one has ever touched him in  exquisiteness of gradation; and no one in landscape in perfect  rendering of organic form.    31. I showed you in this drawing, at last Lecture, how truly he had  matched the color of the iron-stained rocks in the bed of the Ticino;  and any of you who care for color at all cannot but take more or less  pleasure in the black and greens and warm browns opposed throughout.  But the essential value of the work is not in these. It is, first, in  the expression of enormous scale of mountain and space of air, by  gradations of shade in these colors, whatever they may be; and,  secondly, in the perfect rounding and cleaving of the masses alike of  mountain and stone. I showed you one of the stones themselves, as an  example of uninteresting outline. If I were to ask you to paint it,  though its color is pleasant enough, you would still find it  uninteresting and coarse compared to that of a flower, or a bird. But  if I can engage you in an endeavor to draw its true forms in light and  shade, you will most assuredly find it not only interesting, but in  some points quite beyond the most subtle skill you can give to it.    32. You have heard me state to you, several times, that all the  masters who valued accurate form and modeling found the readiest way  of obtaining the facts they required to be firm pen outline, completed  by a wash of neutral tint. This method is indeed rarely used by  Raphael or Michael Angelo in the drawings they have left us, because  their studies are nearly all tentative--experiments in composition, in  which the imperfect or careless pen outline suggested all they  required, and was capable of easy change without confusing the eye.  But the masters who knew precisely before they laid touch on paper  what they were going to do--and this may be, observe, either because  they are less or greater than the men who change; less, in merely  drawing some natural object without attempt at composition, or greater  in knowing absolutely beforehand the composition they intend; it may  be, even so, that what they intend, though better known, is not so  good:--but at all events, in this anticipating power Tintoret, Holbein  and Turner stand, I think, alone as draughtsmen; Tintoret rarely  sketching at all, but painting straight at the first blow, while  Holbein and Turner sketch indeed, but it is as with a pen of iron and  a point of diamond.    33. You will find in your educational series[6] many drawings  illustrative of the method; but I have enlarged here the part that is  executed with the pen, out of this smaller drawing, that you may see  with what fearless strength Holbein delineates even the most delicate  folds of the veil on the head, and of the light muslin on the  shoulders, giving them delicacy, not by the thinness of his line, but  by its exquisite veracity.    [Footnote 6: At the Ruskin Drawing School, Oxford.]    The eye will endure with patience, or even linger with pleasure, on  any line that is right, however coarse; while the faintest or finest  that is wrong will be forcibly destructive. And again and again I have  to recommend you to draw always as if you were engraving, and as if  the line could not be changed.    34. The method used by Turner in the _Liber Studiorum_ is precisely  analogous to that of Holbein. The lines of these etchings are to  trees, rocks, or buildings, absolutely what these of Holbein are; not  suggestions of contingent grace, but determinations of the limits of  future form. You will see the explanatory office of such lines by  placing this outline over my drawing of the stone, until the lines  coincide with the limits of the shadow. You will find that it  intensifies and explains the forms which otherwise would have escaped  notice, and that a perfectly gradated wash of neutral tint with an  outline of this kind is all that is necessary for grammatical  statement of forms. It is all that the great colorists need for their  studies; they would think it wasted time to go farther; but, if you  have no eye for color, you may go farther in another manner, with  enjoyment.    35. Now to go back to Turner.    The _first_ great object of the _Liber Studiorum_, for which I  requested you in my sixth Lecture[7] to make constant use of it, is  the delineation of solid form by outline and shadow. But a yet more  important purpose in each of the designs in that book is the  expression of such landscape powers and character as have especial  relation to the pleasures and pain of human life--but especially the  pain. And it is in this respect that I desired you (Sect. 172) to be  assured, not merely of their superiority, but of their absolute  difference in kind from photography, as works of disciplined design.    [Footnote 7: \"Lectures on Art, 1870,\" Sec. 170.]    [Illustration: NEAR BLAIR ATHOL.    From the painting by Turner.]    36. I do not know whether any of you were interested enough in the  little note in my catalogue on this view near Blair Athol, to look for  the scene itself during your summer rambles. If any did, and found it,  I am nearly certain their impression would be only that of an extreme  wonder how Turner could have made so little of so beautiful a spot.  The projecting rock, when I saw it last in 1857, and I am certain,  when Turner saw it, was covered with lichens having as many colors as  a painted window. The stream--or rather powerful and deep Highland  river, the Tilt--foamed and eddied magnificently through the narrowed  channel; and the wild vegetation in the rock crannies was a finished  arabesque of living sculpture, of which this study of mine, made on  another stream, in Glenfinlas, only a few miles away, will give you a  fair idea. Turner has absolutely stripped the rock of its beautiful  lichens to bare slate, with one quartz vein running up through it; he  has quieted the river into a commonplace stream; he has given, of all  the rich vegetation, only one cluster of quite uninteresting leaves  and a clump of birches with ragged trunks. Yet, observe, I have told  you of it, he has put into one scene the spirit of Scotland.    [Illustration: DUMBLANE ABBEY.    From the painting by Turner.]    37. Similarly, those of you who in your long vacations have ever  stayed near Dumblane will be, I think, disappointed in no small degree  by this study of the abbey, for which I showed you the sketch at last  Lecture. You probably "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#4)"],[1,"NECTIONS]    It will be seen therefore that the Queen was intimately connected with  all classes that are to be found among the ruling families of Germany,  though naturally with the Catholic families, which looked to Austria  and Bavaria for guidance, she had no close ties. But it must be borne  in mind that her connection with Germany always remained a personal  and family matter, and not a political one; this was the fortunate  result of the predominance of the Coburg influence. Had that of the  House of Hanover been supreme, it could hardly have been possible  for the Queen not to have been drawn into the opposition to the  unification of Germany by Prussia, in which the House of Hanover was  bound to take a leading part, in virtue of its position, wealth, and  dignity.    It will be as well here to mention the principal reigning families of  Europe to which Queen Victoria was closely allied through her mother.    The Duchess of Kent's eldest brother, Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg,  was the father of Albert, Prince Consort. Her sister was the wife of  Alexander, Duke of Wuertemberg. The Duchess of Kent's nephew, Ferdinand  (son of Ferdinand, the Duchess's brother), married Maria da Gloria,  Queen of Portugal, and was father of Pedro V. and Luis, both  subsequently Kings of Portugal.    The Duchess's third brother, Leopold (afterwards King of the  Belgians), married first the Princess Charlotte, daughter of George  IV., and afterwards the Princess Louise Marie, eldest daughter of  King Louis Philippe. Prince Augustus (son of Ferdinand, the Duchess  of Kent's brother) married another daughter of Louis Philippe, the  Princess Clementine, while Prince Augustus's sister, Victoria, married  the Duc de Nemours, a son of Louis Philippe. Another nephew, Duke  Friedrich Wilhelm Alexander, son of the Duchess of Wuertemberg, married  the Princess Marie, another daughter of Louis Philippe.    Thus Queen Victoria was closely allied with the royal families of  France, Portugal, Belgium, Saxe-Coburg, and Wuertemberg.    On turning to the immediate Royal Family of England, it will be seen  that the male line at the time of the Queen's accession was limited to  the sons, both named George, of two of the younger brothers of George  IV., the Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge. The sons of George III.  played their part in the national life, shared the strong interest in  military matters, and showed the great personal courage which was a  tradition of the family.      [Pageheading: THE ENGLISH ROYAL FAMILY]    It must be borne in mind that abstention from active political life  had been in no sense required, or even thought desirable, in members  of the Royal House. George III. himself had waged a life-long struggle  with the Whig party, that powerful oligarchy that since the accession  of the House of Hanover had virtually ruled the country; but he did  not carry on the conflict so much by encouraging the opponents of the  Whigs, as by placing himself at the head of a monarchical faction. He  was in fact the leader of a third party in the State. George IV. was  at first a strong Whig, and lived on terms of the greatest intimacy  with Charles James Fox; but by the time that he was thirty, he had  severed the connection with his former political friends, which had  indeed originally arisen more out of his personal opposition to his  father than from any political convictions. After this date he became,  with intervals of vacillation, an advanced Tory of an illiberal  type. William IV. had lived so much aloof from politics before his  accession, that he had had then no very pronounced opinions, though he  was believed to be in favour of the Reform Bill; during his reign his  Tory sympathies became more pronounced, and the position of the Whig  Ministry was almost an intolerable one. His other brothers were men  of decided views, and for the most part of high social gifts. They not  only attended debates in the House of Peers, but spoke with emotion  and vigour; they held political interviews with leading statesmen, and  considered themselves entitled, not to over-rule political movements,  but to take the part in them to which their strong convictions  prompted them. They were particularly prominent in the debates on the  Catholic question, and did not hesitate to express their views with an  energy that was often embarrassing. The Duke of York and the Duke of  Cumberland had used all their influence to encourage the King in his  opposition to Catholic Emancipation, while the Duke of Cambridge had  supported that policy, and the Duke of Sussex had spoken in the House  of Lords in favour of it. The Duke of York, a kindly, generous man,  had held important commands in the earlier part of the Revolutionary  war; he had not shown tactical nor strategical ability, but he was for  many years Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and did good administrative  work in initiating and carrying out much-needed military reforms. He  had married a Prussian princess, but left no issue, and his death,  in 1827, left the succession open to his younger brother, the Duke of  Clarence, afterwards King William IV., and after him to the Princess  Victoria.      [Pageheading: THE ROYAL DUKES]    The Duke of Kent was, as we shall have occasion to show, a strong Whig  with philanthropic views. But the ablest of the princes, though also  the most unpopular, was the Duke of Cumberland, who, until the birth  of the Queen's first child, was heir presumptive to the Throne. He had  been one of the most active members of the ultra-Tory party, who had  opposed to the last the Emancipation of the Catholics and the Reform  Bill. He had married a sister-in-law of the King of Prussia, and lived  much in Berlin, where he was intimate with the leaders of the military  party, who were the centre of reactionary influences in that  country, chief among them being his brother-in-law, Prince Charles of  Mecklenburg.    In private life the Duke was bluff and soldier-like, of rather a  bullying turn, and extraordinarily indifferent to the feelings of  others. \"Ernest is not a bad fellow,\" his brother William IV. said of  him, \"but if anyone has a corn, he will be sure to tread on it.\" He  was very unpopular in England.    On the death of William IV. he succeeded to the throne of Hanover, and  from that time seldom visited England. His first act on reaching his  kingdom was to declare invalid the Constitution which had been  granted in 1833 by William IV. His justification for this was that his  consent, as heir presumptive, which was necessary for its validity,  had not at the time been asked. The act caused great odium to be  attached to his name by all Liberals, both English and Continental,  and it was disapproved of even by his old Tory associates. None the  less he soon won great popularity in his own dominions by his zeal,  good-humour, and energy, and in 1840 he came to terms with the  Estates. A new Constitution was drawn up which preserved more of the  Royal prerogatives than the instrument of 1833. Few German princes  suffered so little in the revolution of 1848. The King died in 1851,  at the age of eighty, and left one son, George, who had been blind  from his boyhood. He was the last King of Hanover, being expelled by  the Prussians in 1866. On the failure of the Ducal line of Brunswick,  the grandson of Ernest Augustus became heir to their dominions, he and  his sons being now the sole male representatives of all the branches  of the House of Brunswick, which a few generations ago was one of the  most numerous and widely-spread ruling Houses in Germany.[1]        [Footnote 1: Of the daughters of George III., Princess Amelia      had died in 1810, and the Queen of Wuertemberg in 1828; two      married daughters survived--Elizabeth, wife of the Landgrave      of Hesse-Homburg, and Mary, who had married her cousin, the      Duke of Gloucester, and lived in England. There were also two      unmarried daughters, the Princesses Augusta and Sophia, living      in England.]    The Duke of Sussex was in sympathy with many Liberal movements, and  supported the removal of religious disabilities, the abolition of the  Corn Laws, and Parliamentary Reform.    The Duke of Cambridge was a moderate Tory, and the most conciliatory  of all the princes. But for more than twenty years he took little part  in English politics, as he was occupied with his duties as Regent of  Hanover, where he did much by prudent reforms to retain the allegiance  of the Hanoverians. On his return to England he resumed the position  of a peacemaker, supporting philanthropic movements, and being a  generous patron of art and letters. He was recognised as \"emphatically  the connecting link between the Crown and the people.\" Another member  of the Royal Family was the Duke of Gloucester, nephew and son-in-law  of George III.; he was more interested in philanthropic movements than  in politics, but was a moderate Conservative, who favoured Catholic  Emancipation but was opposed to Parliamentary Reform.    Thus we have the spectacle of seven Royal princes, of whom two  succeeded to the Throne, all or nearly all avowed politicians of  decided convictions, throwing the weight of their influence and  social position for the most part on the side of the Tory party,  and believing it to be rather their duty to hold and express strong  political opinions than to adopt the moderating and conciliatory  attitude in matters of government that is now understood to be the  true function of the Royal House.      [Pageheading: INDEPENDENCE OF THE QUEEN]    The Queen, after her accession, always showed great respect and  affection for her uncles, but they were not able to exercise any  influence over her character or opinions.    This was partly due to the fact that from an early age she had imbibed  a respect for liberal views from her uncle Leopold, King of the  Belgians, to whom she was devoted from her earliest childhood, "]]]
