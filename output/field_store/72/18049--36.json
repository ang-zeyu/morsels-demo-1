In spite of their quick motions when they spring from the water, many of  the May flies fall back into it and are caught by the fish.    [Illustration here, as the text is broken]    It is said that the trout become fat and good-flavored when the May  flies emerge, they eat so many of them. And what the fish do not catch  the birds try to. Swallows and other insect-loving birds have a glorious  feast when the May flies come out. For a season they live in the midst  of more delicacies than they can possibly use.    Fish like the May fly larvae, too, which is probably the reason the larvae  have learned to live in the mud, out of reach.    Fishermen dig up the larvae for bait, so you see the May flies have a  hard time to get safely through the world.    But in spite of difficulties a great many of them live, and some summer  day out they come trooping.    They spring all at once from the surface of the water as by magic,  hundreds and thousands, yes, millions of them. They fill the air, they  cover everything.    The great naturalist Swammerdam, who was the first to make a thorough  study of the May flies, thus tells us how they appeared in France one  year:--    \"I then saw a sight beyond all expectation. The ephemerae filled the air  like the snowflakes in a dense snowstorm.    \"The steps were covered to a depth of two, three, or even four inches. A  tract of water five or six feet across was completely hidden, and as the  floating insects slowly drifted away, others took their places. Several  times I was obliged to retreat to the top of the stairs from the  annoyance caused by the ephemerae, which dashed in my face, and got into  my eyes, mouth, and nose.\"    These swarms of May flies appear only from three to five days at a  time.    Wherever there are streams there are May flies, and the canals of  Holland make good breeding places for them; no wonder, then, the Dutch,  who you know live in Holland, have a saying, \"As thick as May flies.\"    Although so many of the May flies perish at once, multitudes of them  drop their eggs into the water to renew the race of May flies.    Is it not wonderful that after so long a period of creeping about in the  mud as larvae, these graceful and beautiful little creatures have but a  few hours in which to dance joyously about in the upper air on wings of  gossamer? Some, indeed, live less than an hour, and some, that come out  in the evening, finish their dance of life and perish before sunrise,  without ever having seen the beautiful daylight.    Yes, strange little beings are they.    They do us no harm and we should not kill them.    Let them live their short lives and be happy.          THE STONE FLY FOLK    [Illustration]      John has been fishing.    What do you think he caught?    Nary fish, my dears, but a goodly number of stone flies, which he has  brought to show us.    Yes, Mollie, they do remind us a very little of our May flies, only, of  course, they are many times larger.    It is rather a clumsy creature in spite of its large wings, and John  says he had no trouble whatever in catching it.    See, it has four wings, and the hind ones are the larger.    Yes, May, they fold up in plaits, like the sticks of a fan.    See its long antennae and its compound eyes. Its eyes are not so large as  are those of the dragon fly. It does not spend its time pursuing other  insects, but is more like the May fly after it gets its wings.    Yes, Ned, it lives longer than the May fly, but it does not live very  long, and it eats little.    It is a pretty little gray thing as it rests on the side of John's box,  with its wings folded like a gossamer cloak over its body.    [Illustration]    It lays its eggs in the water, and out of them hatch little six-legged  larvae that are not troubled by want of appetite. If the winged stone fly  does not eat, its larva does; it is like the other larvae we know, always  devouring something.    [Illustration]    Yes, Charlie, it feeds on living creatures, greatly relishing the larvae  of the May flies, or any other luckless insect infants it can capture.    It grows fast and moults several times, and when winter comes it hides  away, only to come forth at the first breath of spring and continue its  eating.    Like other larvae that live under water, it does its breathing by means  of gills, and these gills are in little tufts just above the base of  each leg.    It lives under stones, which is why it is called the stone fly, and it  slides quickly around a corner when you lift up its stone.    Fish are very fond of it, and hunt it as eagerly as it hunts larvae.  Since it makes good bait for brook trout, its life is always in danger.  It finishes its growth in early summer, and emerges from its larval  skin as a perfect winged insect.    Yes, indeed, John, you can often find dozens of the cast-off skins of  the stone flies along the brook sides in the month of June.    The stone flies are harmless little people, and we should never kill one  needlessly.    [Illustration]          THE SILVER FISH      May has something here for us to look at. She says it is a slippery  rascal. Let us see it. Oh, yes, you have it in that little box. See, the  box has a glass top. May cut the top off the box herself, and fastened  in a little pane of glass so we could see the rascal without danger of  its escaping.    [Illustration]    Pretty rascal! Like a little silver fish slipping about the box.    Yes, Charlie, it is called the silver fish. A land fish? Why, yes, it  would be a land fish if it were a fish at all. But in spite of its name  it is no fish. It is covered with shining scales, though, that are very  much like fish scales, and it is shaped a good deal like a fish.    Oh, yes, it is an insect. You see it has six legs. But it has no wings.    No, it is not a young one.    It never will have any wings, no matter how old it may get to be.    It is flat, you see, and its scales make it very slippery, so that it is  hard to catch and yet harder to hold on to after you have caught it. It  goes flashing about like a little silver dart, and it loves to eat  starch.    That is why May calls it a rascal. It eats the starch from the paste  that fastens on her wall paper, and from book-bindings, so you see it  makes things fall to pieces. But my! what a pretty rascal it is! Besides  its name of silver fish, it is also called fish moth, though it is not a  moth at all. It is also called bristle-tail, because of the long,  bristle-like parts at the end of its body; and in some places it is  called a slink, because, you know, it loves dark places, and when you  uncover it in the daytime, it slips around a corner into the dark again.    Yes, it seems to slink about as if it were ashamed of itself, but it is  not ashamed; it does not like the light, and it does not like us to see  it.    Perhaps it is afraid of us.          ORTHOPTERA          THE OLD COCKROACHES    [Illustration]      Children, here is a cockroach.    It was one of the first insects that came to live on the earth;  cockroaches were here before people, and they are here yet.    You do not think it is pretty?    Neither do I.    I don't know anybody who thinks a cockroach pretty.    Oh, no, it won't bite you.    It will only get into your pantry and eat your food.    It will walk around in the night and frighten you if you go suddenly  into the kitchen.    It will not frighten you on purpose, but when it hears you coming, it  will run, and then maybe you will scream and run too.    What is that, May? You've a good mind to scream and run as it is?    Very well, scream and run if you want to; the cockroach won't care.    We do not often see these big black fellows in the North, but sometimes  we do. Down South cockroaches seem to be everywhere.    What, May? You are never going South, then?    Well, you do not need to go; the cockroaches won't care.    They have little heads and long antennae, like threads.    What is that, May? You don't care anything about their heads? You don't  want to know anything about cockroaches?    Oh, yes, you want to know about cockroaches. Remember how old they are.    They have six legs, you see.    You don't care how many legs they have?    Oh, yes, you do. They could not walk if they had no legs.    You wish they couldn't walk?    Dear me, May; you don't seem to like cockroaches.    Poor old cockroaches.    [Illustration]    Think how old they are.    What is that you say? They are old enough to know better?    Why, May, what have they ever done to you?    Nothing, only you don't like them?    Well, well, they don't like you, either. Poor old cockroaches; nobody  seems to like them.    Perhaps they don't care.    Will you let me tell you where they came from?    They do not belong to this country.    Their natural home is tropical Asia.    You see, about four hundred years ago, the ships that bore fruits and  other merchandise from India and other warm countries in Asia, bore, as  well, a number of little, flat, reddish brown stowaways.    [Illustration]    Stowaways, as you know, are people that do not buy their tickets, but  that hide among the ship's cargo, and so get free transportation to  other countries.    Well, these little flat stowaways were not human beings, they were  insects. Yes, May, they were the cockroaches.    When they landed from their hot land of Asia in cold England, they must  have wondered what was to become of them. Many of them no doubt died,  for they cannot stand cold weather at all; but some of them were  carried, with the fruits and other things, quite unintentionally, of  course, for nobody guessed they were there, into warm cellars and  kitchen cupboards.    _Then_ they felt at home!    They knew better than to leave the cosey nooks where they could hide  away and sleep all day, and when they came out at night would find a  delicious supper close at hand.    They are great eaters,"]]]
