But you  can be--you axe just as nice, an'--an' fine--an', for all you know, a  good deal more appealin' to some men.\"    \"Stranger, y'u shore must excuse my temper an' the show I made of  myself,\" replied the girl, with composure.  \"That, to say the least,  was not nice.  An' I don't want anyone thinkin' better of me than I  deserve.  My mother died in Texas, an' I've lived out heah in this wild  country--a girl alone among rough men.  Meetin' y'u to-day makes me see  what a hard lot they are--an' what it's done to me.\"    Jean smothered his curiosity and tried to put out of his mind a growing  sense that he pitied her, liked her.    \"Are you a sheep herder?\" he asked.    \"Shore I am now an' then.  My father lives back heah in a canyon. He's  a sheepman.  Lately there's been herders shot at.  Just now we're short  an' I have to fill in.  But I like shepherdin' an' I love the woods,  and the Rim Rock an' all the Tonto.  If they were all, I'd shore be  happy.\"    \"Herders shot at!\" exclaimed Jean, thoughtfully.  \"By whom? An' what  for?\"    \"Trouble brewin' between the cattlemen down in the Basin an' the  sheepmen up on the Rim.  Dad says there'll shore be hell to pay. I tell  him I hope the cattlemen chase him back to Texas.\"    \"Then--  Are you on the ranchers' side?\" queried Jean, trying to  pretend casual interest.    \"No.  I'll always be on my father's side,\" she replied, with spirit.  \"But I'm bound to admit I think the cattlemen have the fair side of the  argument.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Because there's grass everywhere.  I see no sense in a sheepman goin'  out of his way to surround a cattleman an' sheep off his range.  That  started the row.  Lord knows how it'll end.  For most all of them heah  are from Texas.\"    \"So I was told,\" replied Jean.  \"An' I heard' most all these Texans got  run out of Texas.  Any truth in that?\"    \"Shore I reckon there is,\" she replied, seriously.  \"But, stranger, it  might not be healthy for y'u to, say that anywhere.  My dad, for one,  was not run out of Texas.  Shore I never can see why he came heah. He's  accumulated stock, but he's not rich nor so well off as he was back  home.\"    \"Are you goin' to stay here always?\" queried Jean, suddenly.    \"If I do so it 'll be in my grave,\" she answered, darkly.  \"But what's  the use of thinkin'?  People stay places until they drift away.  Y'u  can never tell.... Well, stranger, this talk is keepin' y'u.\"    She seemed moody now, and a note of detachment crept into her voice.  Jean rose at once and went for his horse.  If this girl did not desire  to talk further he certainly had no wish to annoy her.  His mule had  strayed off among the bleating sheep.  Jean drove it back and then led  his horse up to where the girl stood.  She appeared taller and, though  not of robust build, she was vigorous and lithe, with something about  her that fitted the place.  Jean was loath to bid her good-by.    \"Which way is the Rim?\" he asked, turning to his saddle girths.    \"South,\" she replied, pointing.  \"It's only a mile or so.  I'll walk  down with y'u.... Suppose y'u're on the way to Grass Valley?\"    \"Yes; I've relatives there,\" he returned.  He dreaded her next  question, which he suspected would concern his name.  But she did not  ask.  Taking up her rifle she turned away.  Jean strode ahead to her  side.  \"Reckon if you walk I won't ride.\"    So he found himself beside a girl with the free step of a Mountaineer.  Her bare, brown head came up nearly to his shoulder.  It was a small,  pretty head, graceful, well held, and the thick hair on it was a shiny,  soft brown.  She wore it in a braid, rather untidily and tangled, he  thought, and it was tied with a string of buckskin.  Altogether her  apparel proclaimed poverty.    Jean let the conversation languish for a little.  He wanted to think  what to say presently, and then he felt a rather vague pleasure in  stalking beside her.  Her profile was straight cut and exquisite in  line.  From this side view the soft curve of lips could not be seen.    She made several attempts to start conversation, all of which Jean  ignored, manifestly to her growing constraint.  Presently Jean, having  decided what he wanted to say, suddenly began: \"I like this adventure.  Do you?\"    \"Adventure! Meetin' me in the woods?\"  And she laughed the laugh of  youth.  \"Shore you must be hard up for adventure, stranger.\"    \"Do you like it?\" he persisted, and his eyes searched the half-averted  face.    \"I might like it,\" she answered, frankly, \"if--if my temper had not  made a fool of me.  I never meet anyone I care to talk to.  Why should  it not be pleasant to run across some one new--some one strange in this  heah wild country?\"    \"We are as we are,\" said Jean, simply.  \"I didn't think you made a fool  of yourself.  If I thought so, would I want to see you again?\"    \"Do y'u?\"  The brown face flashed on him with surprise, with a light he  took for gladness.  And because he wanted to appear calm and friendly,  not too eager, he had to deny himself the thrill of meeting those  changing eyes.    \"Sure I do.  Reckon I'm overbold on such short acquaintance.  But I  might not have another chance to tell you, so please don't hold it  against me.\"    This declaration over, Jean felt relief and something of exultation. He  had been afraid he might not have the courage to make it.  She walked  on as before, only with her head bowed a little and her eyes downcast.  No color but the gold-brown tan and the blue tracery of veins showed in  her cheeks.  He noticed then a slight swelling quiver of her throat;  and he became alive to its graceful contour, and to how full and  pulsating it was, how nobly it set into the curve of her shoulder.  Here in her quivering throat was the weakness of her, the evidence of  her sex, the womanliness that belied the mountaineer stride and the  grasp of strong brown hands on a rifle.  It had an effect on Jean  totally inexplicable to him, both in the strange warmth that stole over  him and in the utterance he could not hold back.    \"Girl, we're strangers, but what of that?  We've met, an' I tell you it  means somethin' to me.  I've known girls for months an' never felt this  way.  I don't know who you are an' I don't care.  You betrayed a good  deal to me.  You're not happy.  You're lonely.  An' if I didn't want to  see you again for my own sake I would for yours.  Some things you said  I'll not forget soon.  I've got a sister, an' I know you have no  brother.  An' I reckon ...\"    At this juncture Jean in his earnestness and quite without thought  grasped her hand.  The contact checked the flow of his speech and  suddenly made him aghast at his temerity.  But the girl did not make  any effort to withdraw it.  So Jean, inhaling a deep breath and trying  to see through his bewilderment, held on bravely.  He imagined he felt  a faint, warm, returning pressure.  She was young, she was friendless,  she was human.  By this hand in his Jean felt more than ever the  loneliness of her.  Then, just as he was about to speak again, she  pulled her hand free.    \"Heah's the Rim,\" she said, in her quaint Southern drawl. \"An' there's  Y'ur Tonto Basin.\"    Jean had been intent only upon the girl.  He had kept step beside her  without taking note of what was ahead of him.  At her words he looked  up expectantly, to be struck mute.    He felt a sheer force, a downward drawing of an immense abyss beneath  him. As he looked afar he saw a black basin of timbered country, the  darkest and wildest he had ever gazed upon, a hundred miles of blue  distance across to an unflung mountain range, hazy purple against the  sky. It seemed to be a stupendous gulf surrounded on three sides by  bold, undulating lines of peaks, and on his side by a wall so high that  he felt lifted aloft on the run of the sky.    \"Southeast y'u see the Sierra Anchas,\" said the girl pointing. \"That  notch in the range is the pass where sheep are driven to Phoenix an'  Maricopa.  Those big rough mountains to the south are the Mazatzals.  Round to the west is the Four Peaks Range.  An' y'u're standin' on the  Rim.\"    Jean could not see at first just what the Rim was, but by shifting his  gaze westward he grasped this remarkable phenomenon of nature. For  leagues and leagues a colossal red and yellow wall, a rampart, a  mountain-faced cliff, seemed to zigzag westward.  Grand and bold were  the promontories reaching out over the void.  They ran toward the  westering sun.  Sweeping and impressive were the long lines slanting  away from them, sloping darkly spotted down to merge into the black  timber.  Jean had never seen such a wild and rugged manifestation of  nature's depths and upheavals.  He was held mute.    \"Stranger, look down,\" said the girl.    Jean's sight was educated to judge heights and depths and distances.  This wall upon which he stood sheered precipitously down, so far that  it made him dizzy to look, and then the craggy broken cliffs merged  into red-slided, cedar-greened slopes running down and down into gorges  choked with forests, and from which soared up a roar of rushing waters.  Slope after slope, ridge beyond ridge, canyon merging into canyon--so  the tremendous bowl sunk away to its black, deceiving depths, a  wilderness across which travel seemed impossible.    \"Wonderful!\" exclaimed Jean.    \"Indeed it is!\" murmured the girl.  \"Shore that is Arizona.  I reckon I  love THIS.  The heights an' depths--the awfulness of its wilderness!\"    \"An' you want to leave it?\"    \"Yes an' no.  I don't deny the peace that comes to me heah.  But not  often do I see the Basin, an' for that matter, one doesn't live on  grand scenery.\"    \"Child, even once in a while--this sight would cure any misery, if you  only see.  I'm glad I came.  I'm glad you showed it to me first.\"    She too seemed under the spell of a vastness and loneliness and beauty  and grandeur that could not but strike the heart.    Jean took her hand again.  \"Girl, say "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20709"],[0,"From Pole to Pole: A Book for Young People (#4)"],[1,"life, a grand old aristocratic  town, a town of theatres, concerts, balls, and cafes. The Danube canal,  with its twelve bridges, passes right through Vienna, and outside the  eastern outskirts the Danube itself, in an artificial bed, rolls its  dark blue waters with a melodious murmur, providing an accompaniment to  the famous Viennese waltzes.    If Vienna is, then, one of the centres of human knowledge and  refinement, and if there are a thousand wonderful things to behold  within its walls, yet it contains nothing more remarkable than the old  Emperor. Not because he is so old, or because he still survives as one  of the last of an almost extinct generation, but because by his august  personality he keeps together an empire composed of many different  countries, races, and religious sects. Fifty millions of people are  ranged under his sceptre. There are Germans in Austria, Chechs in  Bohemia, Magyars in Hungary, Polacks in Galicia, and a crowd of other  peoples; nay, even Mohammedans live under the protection of the Catholic  throne.    His life has abounded in cares and vicissitudes. He has lived through  wars, insurrections, and revolutions, and with skill and tact has held  in check all the contending factions which have striven and are still  striving to rend asunder his empire. It is difficult to imagine the  Austro-Hungarian monarchy without him. With him it perhaps stands or  falls; therefore there is no one in the present day whose life is of  greater importance to humanity. He has been the object of murderous  attempts: his wife was assassinated, his only son perished by a violent  death. He is now eighty-two years old, and he has worn the imperial  crown for sixty-four years. Since 1867 he has been king of Hungary.  During his reign the industry, trade, agriculture, and general  prosperity of his dominions have been enormously developed. And the most  remarkable of all is that he still carries his head high, is smart and  upright, and works as hard as a labourer in the Danube valley.    The fortunes of Austria and Hungary are still more closely united with  and dependent on the great river Danube. Certainly in the north we have  the Elbe and the Dniester, and in the south several small rivers which  enter the Adriatic Sea. But otherwise all the rivers of the monarchy  belong to the Danube, and collect from all directions to the main  stream. The Volga is the largest river of Europe and has its own sea,  the Caspian. The Danube is the next largest and has also its sea, the  Black Sea. Its source is also \"black,\" for it takes its rise in the  mountains of the Black Forest in Baden, and from source to mouth it is  little short of 1800 miles.    The Danube flows through Bavaria, Austria, and Hungary, forms the  boundary between Rumania and Bulgaria, and touches a small corner of  Russian territory. It has sixty great tributaries, of which more than  half are navigable. Step by step the volume of the main stream is  augmented. We can see that for ourselves on our way through Europe. At  Budapest, which is cut in two by the river, and where five handsome  bridges connect the banks, we seem almost to be on a lake. The Elizabeth  Bridge has a span of 950 feet. Farther down, on the frontier of  Wallachia, the river is nearly two-thirds of a mile wide; but here the  current is slow; creeks of stagnant water are formed, and marshes  extend far along the banks. And at the point where the Rumanian railway  crosses the Danube, we find at Chernovodsk a bridge over the river which  is nearly 2-1/2 miles long and is the longest in all the world. Not far  from here the waters of the Danube part into three arms and form a broad  delta at the mouth. There grow dense reeds, twice as high as a man, on  which large herds of buffaloes graze, where wolves still seek their  prey, and where water-fowl breed in millions. If we look carefully at  the map, we shall see that Central Europe is occupied mostly by the  Danube valley, and that this valley, with its extensive lowlands, is  bounded by the best-known mountains of Europe; in the north by the  mountains of South Germany and Bohemia and the Carpathians, in the south  by the Alps and the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula.    [Illustration: MAP SHOWING JOURNEY FROM BERLIN TO CONSTANTINOPLE.]    From Budapest the train takes us over the Hungarian plain, a very  singular country, like a trough, for it is surrounded by mountains on  all sides. There is abundance of rain, especially up on the mountain  slopes. The winter is cold and the summer warm, as is always the case in  countries far removed from the sea. Dust and sand storms are common, and  in some parts blown sand collects into dunes. Formerly the Hungarian  lowland was a fertile steppe, where Magyar nomads roamed about on  horseback and tended their cattle and their enormous flocks of sheep.  But now agriculture is extended more and more. Wheat, rye, barley,  maize, rice, potatoes, and wine are produced in such quantities that  they are not only sufficient for the country's needs, but also maintain  a considerable export trade. Round the villages and homesteads grow  oaks, elms, lime-trees, and beeches; poplars and willows are widely  distributed, for their light seeds are carried long distances by the  wind. But in the large steppe districts where marshes are so common the  people have no other fuel but reeds and dried dung.    Cattle-raising has always been an important occupation in Hungary. The  breed of cows, oxen, and buffaloes is continually being improved by  judicious selection, and all kinds of sheep, goats, and pigs are kept in  great numbers, while the rearing of fowls, bee-keeping, the production  of silk from silkworms, and the fishing industry are also highly  developed. To the nomads, who wander from one locality to another with  their herds, horses are necessary, and it is therefore quite natural  that Hungary should be rich in horses--splendid animals of mixed Tatar  and Arabian blood.    This country, where all wealth grows and thrives, and where the land,  well and uniformly watered, contributes in such a high degree to the  well-being of man, is flat and monotonous when viewed from the train. We  see herds with their mounted herdsmen, we see villages, roads and  cottages, but these do not give us any very clear conception of the  country. Therefore it is advisable to spend a few hours in the  agricultural exhibition at Budapest, where we can see the most  attractive models illustrating Hungarian rural life, from pastures and  farmyards to churned butter and manufactured cheeses, from the silk-worm  in the chrysalis to the valuable silken web. We can see the life of  farmers in the country homesteads, in simple reed huts or tents, the  various crops they grow on their fields, the yellow honeycombs taken  from the hives in autumn, tanned leather and the straps, saddles, and  trunks that are made of it. We can see the weapons, implements, and  spoil of the Hungarian hunter and fisherman, and when we come out of the  last room we realise that this country is wisely and affectionately  nursed by its people, and therefore gives profit and prosperity in  exchange.    With unabated speed the train rushes on over the plain, and at length  rattles across a bridge over the Danube into Belgrade, the capital of  Servia. Here we bid good-bye to the Danube and follow the Morava valley  upwards. The Servian villages of low white houses, with pyramidal roofs  of tiles or thatch, are very pretty and picturesquely built; and above  them, green heights, wooded slopes, flocks and herds, and peasants in  bright-coloured motley clothes following the plough. Small murmuring  brooks dance in merry leaps down to the Morava, and the Morava itself  flows to the Danube. We are still in the drainage basin of this river,  and, when we have crossed the whole of Servia, passed over a flat  mountain ridge and left Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, behind us and  have come to another stream, even this is one of the affluents of the  Danube.    During a large part of our journey we are therefore strongly impressed  by this mighty stream, and perceive that it is a condition of existence  to whole peoples and States. Innumerable boats navigate its  channel--from rowing-boats, ferries, and barges to steamers of heavy  freight. They maintain communication between the series of towns with  walls and houses reflected in the gliding water. Their wharves are  frequently in connection with trains; and many railways have been built  with an eye to the traffic on the Danube. In early times, when the  migrations of people from the east streamed over Europe, the Danube  valley was generally utilized; and still at the present day the river  affords an advantageous channel of communication between the western and  eastern parts of the Continent.    Night jealously conceals from our eyes the kingdom of Bulgaria, as we  travel through its southern part along the river Maritza, which flows  southwards. We do not leave its valley until we are beyond the Turkish  frontier and Adrianople. Here we are in the broadest part of the Balkan  Peninsula; and amidst the regular swaying of the train we lie thinking  of the famous Balkan lands which extend to the south--Albania, with its  warlike people among its mountains and dales; Macedonia, the country of  Alexander the Great; Greece, in ancient times the centre of learning and  art. When day dawns we are in Turkey, and the sun is high when the train  comes to a standstill in Constantinople.      CONSTANTINOPLE    [Illustration: PLATE II. CONSTANTINOPLE.]    From the highest platform of the lofty tower which rises from the square  in the centre of the promontory of Stambul a wonderful view can be  obtained of the city and its surroundings--a singular blending of great  masses of houses and glittering sheets of blue water. Stambul is the  Turkish quarter. It consists of a sea of closely-built wooden houses "]]]
