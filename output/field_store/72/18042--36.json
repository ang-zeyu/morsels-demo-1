In 1776, when independence was declared, the United States included only  the thirteen original States on the seaboard. With the exception of a  few hunters there were no white men west of the Alleghany Mountains, and  there was not even an American hunter in the great country out of which  we have since made the States of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and  Wisconsin. All this region north of the Ohio River then formed apart  of the Province of Quebec. It was a wilderness of forests and prairies,  teeming with game, and inhabited by many warlike tribes of Indians.    Here and there through it were dotted quaint little towns of French  Creoles, the most important being Detroit, Vincennes on the Wabash, and  Kaskaskia and Kahokia on the Illinois. These French villages were ruled  by British officers commanding small bodies of regular soldiers or Tory  rangers and Creole partizans. The towns were completely in the power  of the British government; none of the American States had actual  possession of a foot of property in the Northwestern Territory.    The Northwest was acquired in the midst of the Revolution only by armed  conquest, and if it had not been so acquired, it would have remained a  part of the British Dominion of Canada.    The man to whom this conquest was clue was a famous backwoods leader,  a mighty hunter, a noted Indian-fighter, George Rogers Clark. He was a  very strong man, with light hair and blue eyes. He was of good Virginian  family. Early in his youth, he embarked on the adventurous career of  a backwoods surveyor, exactly as Washington and so many other young  Virginians of spirit did at that period. He traveled out to Kentucky  soon after it was founded by Boone, and lived there for a year, either  at the stations or camping by him self in the woods, surveying, hunting,  and making war against the Indians like any other settler; but all the  time his mind was bent on vaster schemes than were dreamed of by the  men around him. He had his spies out in the Northwestern Territory, and  became convinced that with a small force of resolute backwoodsmen he  could conquer it for the United States. When he went back to Virginia,  Governor Patrick Henry entered heartily into Clark's schemes and gave  him authority to fit out a force for his purpose.    In 1778, after encountering endless difficulties and delays, he finally  raised a hundred and fifty backwoods riflemen. In May they started down  the Ohio in flatboats to undertake the allotted task. They drifted and  rowed downstream to the Falls of the Ohio, where Clark founded a log  hamlet, which has since become the great city of Louisville.    Here he halted for some days and was joined by fifty or sixty  volunteers; but a number of the men deserted, and when, after an eclipse  of the sun, Clark again pushed off to go down with the current, his  force was but about one hundred and sixty riflemen. All, however, were  men on whom he could depend--men well used to frontier warfare. They  were tall, stalwart backwoodsmen, clad in the hunting-shirt and leggings  that formed the national dress of their kind, and armed with the  distinctive weapon of the backwoods, the long-barreled, small-bore  rifle.    Before reaching the Mississippi the little flotilla landed, and Clark  led his men northward against the Illinois towns. In one of them,  Kaskaskia, dwelt the British commander of the entire district up to  Detroit. The small garrison and the Creole militia taken together  outnumbered Clark's force, and they were in close alliance with the  Indians roundabout. Clark was anxious to take the town by surprise and  avoid bloodshed, as he believed he could win over the Creoles to the  American side. Marching cautiously by night and generally hiding by day,  he came to the outskirts of the little village on the evening of July 4,  and lay in the woods near by until after nightfall.    Fortune favored him. That evening the officers of the garrison had  given a great ball to the mirth-loving Creoles, and almost the entire  population of the village had gathered in the fort, where the dance  was held. While the revelry was at its height, Clark and his tall  backwoodsmen, treading silently through the darkness, came into the  town, surprised the sentries, and surrounded the fort without causing  any alarm.    All the British and French capable of bearing arms were gathered in the  fort to take part in or look on at the merrymaking. When his men were  posted Clark walked boldly forward through the open door, and, leaning  against the wall, looked at the dancers as they whirled around in the  light of the flaring torches. For some moments no one noticed him.  Then an Indian who had been lying with his chin on his hand, looking  carefully over the gaunt figure of the stranger, sprang to his feet, and  uttered the wild war-whoop. Immediately the dancing ceased and the men  ran to and fro in confusion; but Clark, stepping forward, bade them be  at their ease, but to remember that henceforth they danced under the  flag of the United States, and not under that of Great Britain.    The surprise was complete, and no resistance was attempted. For  twenty-four hours the Creoles were in abject terror. Then Clark summoned  their chief men together and explained that he came as their ally, and  not as their foe, and that if they would join with him they should be  citizens of the American republic, and treated in all respects on  an equality with their comrades. The Creoles, caring little for the  British, and rather fickle of nature, accepted the proposition with joy,  and with the most enthusiastic loyalty toward Clark. Not only that, but  sending messengers to their kinsmen on the Wabash, they persuaded the  people of Vincennes likewise to cast off their allegiance to the British  king, and to hoist the American flag.    So far, Clark had conquered with greater ease than he had dared to hope.  But when the news reached the British governor, Hamilton, at Detroit,  he at once prepared to reconquer the land. He had much greater forces at  his command than Clark had; and in the fall of that year he came down to  Vincennes by stream and portage, in a great fleet of canoes bearing five  hundred fighting men-British regulars, French partizans, and Indians.  The Vincennes Creoles refused to fight against the British, and the  American officer who had been sent thither by Clark had no alternative  but to surrender.    If Hamilton had then pushed on and struck Clark in Illinois, having  more than treble Clark's force, he could hardly have failed to win the  victory; but the season was late and the journey so difficult that he  did not believe it could be taken. Accordingly he disbanded the Indians  and sent some of his troops back to Detroit, announcing that when spring  came he would march against Clark in Illinois.    If Clark in turn had awaited the blow he would have surely met defeat;  but he was a greater man than his antagonist, and he did what the other  deemed impossible.    Finding that Hamilton had sent home some of his troops and dispersed  all his Indians, Clark realized that his chance was to strike before  Hamilton's soldiers assembled again in the spring. Accordingly he  gathered together the pick of his men, together with a few Creoles, one  hundred and seventy all told, and set out for Vincennes. At first the  journey was easy enough, for they passed across the snowy Illinois  prairies, broken by great reaches of lofty woods. They killed elk,  buffalo, and deer for food, there being no difficulty in getting all  they wanted to eat; and at night they built huge fires by which to  sleep, and feasted \"like Indian war-dancers,\" as Clark said in his  report.    But when, in the middle of February, they reached the drowned lands of  the Wabash, where the ice had just broken up and everything was flooded,  the difficulties seemed almost insuperable, and the march became painful  and laborious to a degree. All day long the troops waded in the icy  water, and at night they could with difficulty find some little hillock  on which to sleep. Only Clark's indomitable courage and cheerfulness  kept the party in heart and enabled them to persevere. However,  persevere they did, and at last, on February 23, they came in sight  of the town of Vincennes. They captured a Creole who was out shooting  ducks, and from him learned that their approach was utterly unsuspected,  and that there were many Indians in town.    Clark was now in some doubt as to how to make his fight. The British  regulars dwelt in a small fort at one end of the town, where they had  two light guns; but Clark feared lest, if he made a sudden night attack,  the townspeople and Indians would from sheer fright turn against him. He  accordingly arranged, just before he himself marched in, to send in the  captured duck-hunter, conveying a warning to the Indians and the Creoles  that he was about to attack the town, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18647"],[0,"Peeps at Many Lands: Egypt (#4)"],[1,"and story-teller of his quarter, is easily  distinguished by the fine-meshed net hung across the entrance as a  protection against flies, for flies abound in Cairo, which, however  disagreeable they may be, is perhaps fortunate in a country where the  laws of sanitation are so lightly regarded.    Noise enters largely into street life, and the native is invariably  loud voiced. No bargain is concluded without an apparent squabble, and  every tradesman in the street calls his wares, while drivers of  vehicles are incessant in their cries of warning to foot-passengers.  All the sounds are not unmusical, however, for from the minarets comes  the \"muezzin's\" sweet call to prayer, to mingle with the jingling  bells and the tinkling of the cups of the water-sellers.    Then the donkey-boys, everywhere to be found in Cairo, add much to the  liveliness of the streets. Their donkeys are fine animals, usually  grey and very large, and their bodies are shaved in such a manner as  to leave patterns on the legs and snout, which are often coloured. The  saddles are of red leather and cloth, and from them hang long tassels  which swing as they canter through the streets, while the musical  rattle of coloured beads and the chains of copper and brass which all  donkeys wear around their necks, add their quota to the many noises of  the streets, through which in a low murmur one may distinguish the  drone of flies.    Among all the bustle and confusion, shimmering lights, and varied  colour which constitute a Cairo street scene, the native woman passes  with graceful dignity. Her features are hidden by the \"bourka,\" or  veil, which is generally worn, but her beautiful eyes fascinate; nor  does the voluminous cloak she wears entirely conceal the dainty, if  brilliant, clothing beneath, nor the extreme beauty of her well-shaped  hands and feet.    Quite as picturesque as the life of the streets are the buildings  which enclose them, and the great glory of Cairo consists of its  bazaars and mosques and old-time palaces.    The streets are usually irregular in width and often winding, and are  sometimes so narrow as to render driving impossible, for when Cairo  was built wheeled vehicles were not in use, and space within its walls  was limited. The houses are very lofty, and are built of limestone or  rubble covered with white plaster, and the lower courses are often  coloured in stripes of yellow, white, and red. Handsome carved  doorways open from the street, and the doors are panelled in bold  arabesque design, or enriched by metal studs and knockers of bronze.  The windows on the ground-floor, which are usually small, are closed  by a wooden or iron grating, and are placed too high in the wall for  passengers to look through them, and frequently, even in the best  houses, small recesses in the walls serve as shops.    The upper storeys usually project beyond the ground-floor, and are  supported on corbels or brackets of stone, which also are frequently  carved. This method of building has two advantages, for the projecting  upper storeys afford a little shade in the streets, and at the same  time give greater space to the houses without encroaching upon the  already narrow thoroughfares.    These upper storeys are very picturesque, for all the windows are  filled with lattice-work, and large window balconies supported on  carved wooden beams project far over the street. These are called  \"mushrabiyehs,\" a name which is derived from an Arabic word which  means \"the place for drink.\" Originally they were simply small cages  of plain lattice-work in which the water jars were placed to cool, but  as prosperity increased and the homes of the people became more  ornate, first the edges of the lattice-work were cut so as to form a  pattern, and the little cages presently developed into these large  balconies, which in place of simple lattice-work were enclosed by  screens formed of innumerable small pieces of turned wood built up so  as to form designs of great beauty, and behind which the ladies of the  harim might sit and enjoy the air and the animation of the streets  unseen.    Unfortunately this beautiful work is fast disappearing; visitors have  discovered how adaptable it is to home decoration, and the dealers in  Cairo eagerly buy up all that can be obtained to be converted into  those many articles of Arab furniture with which we are now so  familiar in England.    Picturesque as all the streets of Cairo are, they are not all so  animated as those I have described, and in many quarters one may ride  for miles through streets so narrow that no vehicle could pass, and so  silent as to appear deserted. Very often their projecting upper  storeys almost touch across the street, and make it so dark as to be  almost like a tunnel. The handsome doorways also are often half buried  in the debris which for three hundred years or more has been  accumulating in the narrow lanes, so much so that in many cases the  doors cannot be opened at all. There is an air of decay and sadness  in many of these quarters, for these half ruinous houses, once the  palaces of the Memluks, are now the habitations of the lowest of  the people, and poverty and squalor reign where once had been gaiety  and the fashionable life of Cairo.          CHAPTER IV    CAIRO--II      Fascinating though the streets of Cairo are, continuous sight-seeing  in the heat and glare is tiring, and it is always a pleasant change to  escape from the movement and bustle outside, and enjoy the quietude of  some cool mosque or palace courtyard.    Having described the exterior of the native house, it will interest  you to know what it is like inside. Entering from the street, one  usually has to descend one or more steps to the entrance hall or  passage, which, in the case of the older houses, is invariably built  with at least one turning, so that no one from the street could see  into the interior court or garden should the door be open, for privacy  was always jealously guarded by the Mohammedans. On one side is a  raised stone platform, seat for the \"boab\" or door-keeper, and other  servants of the house. Passing through this passage, we reach the  courtyard, which is often very large and open to the sky, and into  which most of the windows of the house open. On one side is a large  recess or bay raised slightly above the pavement of the court, and  furnished with benches of carved wood. The beams of the ceiling and  handsome cornice are richly ornamented with carving and illumination,  and the heavy beam which spans the entrance is supported by a pillar  of elegant shape and proportion. Here, or in the \"mandara\"[3] inside  the house, the Arab host receives his male guests. On the most shady  side of the court are placed the \"zirs,\" while several doors lead  to the harim, as the ladies' quarters are called, and the various  offices and reception-rooms of the house. These doors are always  panelled in elaborate geometrical designs, and the principal one,  which is reached by a short flight of stone steps, is set in a lofty  recess, the trefoil head of which is richly carved. This gives access  to the reception-room on the first floor. One side is entirely open to  the air, and through three archways connected by a low balustrade of  perforated stonework overlooks the court. The floor is paved in tiles  or marble of various colours, usually in some large design, in the  centre of which is a shallow basin in which a fountain plays. Round  the three walls is a raised dais called \"lewan,\" covered with rugs  or mattresses, on which the guests recline. Little recesses in the  walls, which in the homes of the wealthy are elaborately decorated  with mosaic or tile work, contain the water jars, and the \"tisht wa  abrik,\" or water-jug and basin, used for the ceremonial washing of  hands before meat. The walls are usually plain, and are only broken by  the \"dulab,\" or wall cupboard, in which pipes and other articles are  kept. The ceiling is heavily beamed and illuminated, or covered with  applique work in some rich design, the spaces variously coloured or  picked out in gold.    [Footnote 3: Guest chamber.]    For cold weather another similar room is provided in the interior of the  house much as the one I have described, but with the addition of a  cupola or dome over the fountain, while the large windows, in the  recesses of which couches are placed, are filled with the beautiful  \"mushrabiyeh\" work we have noticed from the streets, or by stained glass  set in perforated plaster work. These rooms contain practically no  furniture, excepting the low \"sahniyeh,\" or tray, upon which  refreshments are served, and the copper brazier which contains the  charcoal fire, but from the ceiling hang numbers of beautifully-wrought  lamps of metal and coloured glass. We can imagine how rich a scene such  a room would form when illuminated for the reception of guests whose  gorgeous Oriental costumes accord so well with its handsome interior,  while the finishing touch is given by the performance of the musicians  and singing girls with which the guests are entertained, leading one  instinctively to call to mind many similar scenes so wonderfully  described in the \"Arabian Nights.\" Many of the adventures of its heroes  and heroines are suggested by the secret passages which the wall  cupboards often hide, and may well have occurred in houses we may visit  to-day in Cairo, for, more than any other, Cairo is the city of the  \"Arabian Nights,\" and in our walks one may at any moment meet the  hunchback or the pastry-cook, or the one-eyed calender, whose adventures  fills so many pages of that fascinating book; while the summary justice  and drastic measures of the old khalifs are recalled by the many  instruments of torture or of death which may still be seen hanging in  the bazaars or from the city gates.    Everyone who goes to Cairo is astonished at the great number and  beauty of its mosques,"]]]
