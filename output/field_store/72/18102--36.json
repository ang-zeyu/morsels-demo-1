Weasel!\" The Cocks ran to  drive the Weasel away, and the Hens followed to see it done. All was  noise and hurry, and they saw nothing of the Weasel except the tip of  his bushy tail as he drew his slender body through an opening in the  fence.    The Dorking Hen was on one of the long perches where the fowls roost at  night, the newly hatched Chicken lay shivering in the nest, and on the  floor were the pieces of the wonderful shiny egg. The Dorking Hen had  knocked it from the nest in her flight.    The Dorking Cock looked very cross. He was not afraid of a Weasel, and  he did not see why she should be. \"Just like a Hen!\" he said.    The Black Spanish Hen turned to him before he could say another word.  \"Just like a Cock!\" she exclaimed. \"I never raise Chickens myself. It is  not the custom among the Black Spanish Hens. We lay the eggs and  somebody else hatches them. But if I had been on the nest as long as  Mrs. Dorking has, do you suppose I'd let any fowl speak to me as you  spoke to her? I'd--I'd--\" and she was so angry that she couldn't say  another word, but just strutted up and down and cackled.    A motherly old Shanghai Hen flew up beside Mrs. Dorking. \"We are very  sorry for you,\" she said. \"I know how I should have felt if I had broken  my two-yolked egg just as it was ready to hatch.\"    The Bantam Hen picked her way to the nest. \"What a dear little Chicken!\"  she cried, in her most comforting tone. \"He is so plump and so bright  for his age. But, my dear, he is chilly, and I think you should cuddle  him under your wings until his down is dry.\"    The Dorking Hen flew down. \"He is a dear,\" she said, \"and yet when he  was hatched I didn't care much for him, because I had thought so long  about the shiny egg. It serves me right to lose that one, because I have  been so foolish. Still, I do not know how I could stand it if it were  not for my good neighbors.\"    While Mrs. Dorking was talking with the Bantam by her nest, the Black  Spanish Hen scratched a hole in the earth under the perches, poked the  pieces of the shiny egg into it, and covered them up. \"I never raise  Chickens myself,\" she said, \"but if I did----\"    The Shanghai Cock walked away with the Dorking Cock. \"I'm sorry for  you,\" he said, \"and I am more sorry for Mrs. Dorking. She is too fine a  Hen to be spoken to as you spoke to her this morning, and I don't want  to hear any more of your fault-finding. Do you understand?\" And he  ruffled his neck feathers and stuck his face close to that of the  Dorking Cock. They stared into each other's eyes for a minute; then the  Dorking Cock, who was not so big and strong as the Shanghai, shook his  head and answered sweetly, \"It was rude of me. I won't do it again.\"    From that day to this, nobody in the poultry yard has ever spoken of the  shiny egg, and the Dorkings are much liked by the other fowls. Yet if it  had not been for her trouble, Mrs. Dorking and her neighbors would never  have become such good friends. The little Dorkings are fine,  fat-breasted Chicks, with the extra toe on each foot of which all that  family are so proud.          THE DUCKLING WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO      \"Quack! Quack!\" called the Duck who had been sitting on her nest so  long. \"My first egg is cracked, and I can see the broad yellow bill of  my eldest child. Ah! Now I can see his downy white head.\" The Drake  heard her and quacked the news to every one around, and flapped his  wings, and preened his feathers, for was not this the first Duckling  ever hatched on the farm?    The Drake had not been there long himself. It was only a few days before  the Duck began sitting that she and her five sisters had come with him  to this place. It had not taken them long to become acquainted with the  other farmyard people, and all had been kind to them. The Geese had  rather put on airs, at first, because they were bigger and had longer  legs, but the Ducks and Drake were too wise to notice this in any way,  and before long the Geese were as friendly as possible. They would have  shown the Ducks the way to the water if it had been necessary, but it  was not, for Ducks always know without being told just where to find it.  They know, and they do not know why they know. It is one of the things  that are.    Now that the first Duckling had chipped the shell, everybody wanted to  see him, and there was soon a crowd of fowls around the nest watching  him free himself from it. The Drake stood by, as proud as a Peacock. \"I  think he looks much like his mother,\" said he.    \"Yes, yes,\" cackled all the Hens. \"The same broad yellow bill, the same  short yellow legs, and the same webbed feet.\"    The mother Duck smiled. \"He looks more like me now than he will by and  by,\" she said, \"for when his feathers grow and cover the down, he will  have a stiff little one curled up on his back like the Drake's. And  really, except for the curled feather, his father and I look very much  alike.\"    \"That is so,\" said the Black Spanish Cock. \"You do look alike; the same  white feathers, the same broad breast, the same strong wings, the same  pointed tail, the same long neck, the same sweet expression around the  bill!\" That was just like the Black Spanish Cock. He always said  something pleasant about people when he could, and it was much better  than saying unpleasant things. Indeed, he was the most polite fowl in  the poultry-yard, and the Black Spanish Hen thought his manners quite  perfect.    Then the Duckling's five aunts pushed their way through the crowd to the  nest under the edge of the strawstack. \"Have you noticed what fine  large feet he has?\" said one of them. \"That is like his mother's people.  See what a strong web is between the three long toes on each foot! He  will be a good swimmer. The one toe that points backward is small, to be  sure, but he does not need that in swimming. That is only to make  waddling easier.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" \"A fine web,\" and \"Very large feet,\" cried the fowls around  the nest, but most of them didn't care so much about the size of his  feet as the Ducks did. Large feet are always useful, you know, yet  nobody needs them so badly as Geese and Ducks. The Geese were off  swimming, and so could not see the Duckling when first he came out of  the shell.    \"Tap-tap, tap-tap,\" sounded inside another shell, and they knew that  there would soon be a second damp little Duckling beside the first. The  visitors could not stay to see this one come out, and they went away  for a time. The eldest Duckling had supposed that this was life, to have  people around saying, \"How bright he is!\" \"What fine legs!\" or \"He has a  beautiful bill!\" And now that they all walked away and his mother was  looking after the Duckling who was just breaking her shell, he didn't  like it--he didn't like it at all.    Still, it was much better so. If he had had no brothers and sisters, he  would have been a lonely little fellow; besides, he would have had his  own way nearly all the time, and that is likely to make any Duckling  selfish. Then, too, if all the other fowls had petted him and given him  the best of everything, he would have become vain. Truly, it was a good  thing for him not to be the only child, and he soon learned to think so.    After there were two Ducklings, a third one came, and a fourth, and a  fifth, and so on until, when the broken shells were cleared away and  the mother had counted bills, she could call to the Drake and her  sisters, \"Nine Ducklings hatched, and there were only nine eggs in the  nest.\"    \"Then come to the brook,\" said the Drake, \"and let the children have a  bath. I have been swimming a great many times to-day, and they have not  even set foot in water yet. Why, our eldest son was out of his shell  before the Horses were harnessed this morning, and here it is nearly  time for their supper.\"    \"I couldn't help it,\" said the mother Duck. \"I couldn't leave the nest  to take him swimming until the rest were ready to go. I am doing the  best I can.\"    \"I didn't mean to find fault,\" said the Drake, \"and I suppose you  couldn't get away, but we know that Ducklings should be taught to bathe  often, and there is nothing like beginning in time.\"    \"I might have taken some of them to the brook,\" said one of the aunts.  The mother straightened her neck and held her head very high, while she  answered, \"You? You are very kind, but what do you know about bringing  up Ducklings?\"    Now the aunt might have said, \"I know just as much as you do,\" for it  was the young mother's first brood, yet she kept still. She thought, \"I  may hatch Ducklings of my own some day, and then I suppose I shall want  to care for them myself.\"    \"Wait,\" said the Drake, as they reached the brook. \"Let us wait and see  what the children will do.\" The words were hardly out of his bill  when--flutter--splash--splash!--there were nine yellow-white Ducklings  floating on the brook and murmuring happily to each other as though they  had never done anything else.    The Dorking Cock stood on the bank. \"Who taught them to swim?\" said he.    \"Nobody,\" answered their mother proudly. \"They knew without being told.  That is the way a Duck takes to water.\" And she gave a dainty lurch and  was among her brood.    [Illustration: THEY HAD A GOOD SWIM.]    \"Well!\" exclaimed the Dorking Cock. \"I thought the little Dorkings were  as bright as children could be, but they didn't know as much as that. I  must tell them.\" He stalked off, talking under his breath.    \"They know more than that,\" said the Drake. \"Did you see how they ran  ahead of us when we stopped to talk? They knew where to find water as  soon as they were out of the shell. Still, the Cock might not have  believed that if I had told him.\"    They had a good swim, and then all stood on the bank and dried  themselves.

THE QUEEN'S PAGE          Once I was a little page        To a May-day queen,      And I wore a little coat        Made of Lincoln green.        Oh, the queen was beautiful!        And she had a bright      Crown of golden cuckoo-buds        And violets blue and white.        On the step beside her throne        I sat very still,      Ready, as a page should be,        To obey her will.

Watch the trailing grasses string        Strands of purple shells      That the lazy ripples ring,        Sweet as silver bells;      Watch the sunshine sift and drift        Down the eddy whirls,      Whence the laden whiteweeds lift        Loads of blossom pearls;        While the limpid shadows slip        Softly in between,      And the pussy-willows dip        Lightly in the green      Of the mocking trees that grow        Down the water-sky,      Flecked with fleecy clouds that blow        Where the reed-birds fly.

THE FIRST RED-BIRD          I heard a song at daybreak,        So honey-sweet and clear,      The essence of all joyous things        Seemed mingling in its cheer.        The frosty world about me        I searched with eager gaze,      But all was slumber-bound and wrapped        In violet-tinted haze.        Then suddenly a sunbeam        Shot slanting o'er the hill,      And once again from out the sky        I heard that honied trill.        And there upon a poplar,        Poised at its topmost height,      I saw a little singer clad        In scarlet plumage bright.        The poplar branches quivered,        By dawn winds lightly blown,      And like a breeze-swept poppy-flower        The red-bird rocked and shone.        The blue sky, and his feathers        Flashed o'er by golden light,      Oh, all my heart with rapture thrilled,        It was so sweet a sight!

Fickle still you must remain      Long as winds blow, weather-vane!          THE SWAN          Stately swan, so proud and white      Glistening in the morning light,      Come and tell me is it true      That a snow-white swan like you,      Guided by bright golden chains      In his beak for bridle reins,      Once upon a time from far      Fabled lands where fairies are      Brought a magic boat wherein      Rode the brave knight Lohengrin?        Stately swan, so proud and white      Glistening in the morning light,      If you only wore a gold      Harness, like that swan of old,      And if trailing in your wake      Sailing on the silver lake      Was a boat of magic and      You could float to fairy-land,      Then I'd jump in and begin      Traveling like Lohengrin!

A SURE SIGN          When you see upon the walk      Circles newly made of chalk,      And around them all the day      Little boys in eager play      Rolling marbles, agates fine,      Banded, polished, red as wine,      Marbles crystal as the dew,      Each with rainbows twisted through,      Marbles gay in painted clay,      Flashing, twinkling in your way,      When the walk has blossomed so,      Surely every one must know      None need wonder who has heard      Robin, wren, or Peter-bird;      Sure the sign as song or wing,            It is spring!          ANOTHER SURE SIGN          When pink-cheeked on every hand      Little girls are seen to stand      Turning skipping ropes,--_swish-swash!_--      While their laughing playmates run      Jumping over,--oh, what fun!--        _Swish-swash! Swish-swash!_      Two and two now, see them dash!        _One, two, one, two,_      Round they scamper, safely through,      _Swish-swash!_ such merry skipping,      _One, two,_--some one is tripping!      Ah, she's out now and must pay      Turning rope while others play!      See the bobbing golden curls,      Little skirts in rhythmic swirls      Rising, falling, to the beat      Of the little skipping feet!      When these pretty sights appear,      It is surely very clear              April's here!          THE ROBIN'S BATH          A flash and flicker of dripping wings,        A wet red breast that glows      Bright as the newly opened bud        The first red poppy shows,      A sparkle of flying rainbow drops,        A glint of golden sun      On ruffled feathers, a snatch of song,        And the robin's bath is done.          THE FROSTED PANE              When I wakened, very early,          All my window-pane was pearly      With a sparkling little picture traced in lines of shining white;          Some magician with a gleaming          Frosty brush, while I was dreaming,      Must have come and by the starlight worked through all the quiet night.            He had painted frosty people,          And a frosty church and steeple,      And a frosty bridge and river tumbling over frosty rocks;          Frosty mountain peaks that glimmered,          And fine frosty ferns that shimmered,      And a frosty little pasture full of frosty little flocks.            It was all touched"]]]
