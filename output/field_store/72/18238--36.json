The new policy was connected with the introduction of the orders of the  Roman Catholic Church, and with the building of cathedrals and abbeys.  This movement commenced with the close of the eleventh century, and  continued to the middle of the sixteenth; it embraced all the time when  the Church of Scotland was guided by the regime of Rome, although it is  to be recalled that the Scottish Church never ceased to maintain a  native independence--its heirloom from the ancient Celtic Church. This  independence, manifested on important historical occasions throughout  mediaeval times, at last found its national embodiment in the Reformed  Church of 1560.    Scotland was divided into thirteen dioceses--St. Andrews, Glasgow,  Dunkeld, Aberdeen, Moray, Brechin, Dunblane, Ross, Caithness, Galloway,  Lismore or Argyll, the Isles, and Orkney; but before sketching the  history and architecture of each of the thirteen cathedrals, it will be  necessary to indicate the general features of the various periods of  Scottish architecture itself, as it is of this movement the structures  themselves are all an expression.          CHAPTER II    SKETCH OF SCOTTISH ARCHITECTURE      Architecture is a great stone book in which nations have recorded their  annals, before the days of the printing-press: have written their  thoughts, expressed their aspirations, and embodied their feelings as  clearly and truly as by any other form of utterance. We know Egypt as  vividly by its pyramids, the age of Pericles by the Parthenon of Athens,  Imperial Rome by the Flavian Amphitheatre and the Baths of Caracalla, as  from the pages of their respective literature. The mediaeval cathedrals,  monasteries, and churches are a living record of the faith and devotion  of mediaeval men, who have left besides them but little else whereby we  can know their aspirations and civilisation; we find in them an  expression of the deepest life that characterised the periods to which  they belong, and a record which, though often mutilated, and sometimes  nearly obliterated, never deceives. Wherever these architectural  creations are found, there also a voice ought to be heard, telling what  at that spot and at some previous time men thought and felt; what their  civilisation enabled them to accomplish, and to what state they had  attained in their conception of God. In a very true sense it can be said  that the architecture of a country is the history of that country, and  that the record of the architecture is the record of its civilisation.    \"Mediaeval architecture,\" said Sir Gilbert Scott, \"is distinguished from  all other styles as being the last link of the mighty chain which had  stretched unbroken through nearly 4000 years--the glorious termination  of the history of original and genuine architecture....[2] It has been  more entirely developed under the influence of the Christian religion,  and more thoroughly carried out its tone and sentiment, than any other  style. It is _par eminence_ Christian.... Its greatest glory is the  solemnity of religious character which pervades the interior of its  temples. To this all its other attributes must bend, as it is this which  renders it so pre-eminently suited to the highest uses of the Christian  Church. It was this, probably, which led Romney to exclaim, that if  Grecian architecture was the work of glorious men, Gothic was the  invention of gods.\"[3] This architecture was perfected by the mediaeval  builders--the round arch in the twelfth and the pointed arch in the two  succeeding centuries. Its progress was the realisation of three great  aims, towards which the Romanesque architects were ever striving--the  perfecting of the arcuated and vaulted construction, the increase of the  altitude of their proportion, and the general adding of refinement and  delicacy to their details.[4]    Scotland, it has been maintained by those competent to judge, can show a  continuous series of Christian structures, beginning with the primitive  cells and oratories of the early anchorites, and extending through all  the periods of mediaeval art. It exemplifies two distinctive phases of  artistic development--the first comprising the rise and decline of  Celtic Art in early Christian times, and the second allied to the  various stages of general European culture. The Celtic churches, round  towers, and sculptured monuments similar to those found in Ireland, are  followed by primitive examples of Norman work, pointing to the Saxon and  Norman influence of the eleventh century, which produced a complete  revolution in the artistic elements of the country and led to a full  development of the Romanesque or Norman style of architecture--a style  similar to the round arched architecture of other European countries in  the twelfth century. This is manifested chiefly in small parish  churches, but also in large, elaborate buildings, and one cathedral.[5]    The succeeding Gothic styles are also well represented in Scotland, and  exhibit both certain local peculiarities and a general correspondence  with the arts of the different periods in France and England. The First  Pointed style is represented in Scotland during the thirteenth century,  but owing to the disastrous situation of the country during the  fourteenth century, the number of \"decorated\" buildings is pronounced to  be comparatively small. On the other hand, it is maintained that during  the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the \"Perpendicular\" style  prevailed in England and the \"Flamboyant\" in France, the architecture of  Scotland was distinguished by a style peculiar to the country, in which  many features derived from both the above styles may be detected.[6]  \"While the mediaeval architecture of Scotland thus corresponds on the  whole with that of the rest of Europe, there exists in the ecclesiology  of the country an amount of native development sufficient to give it a  special value as one of the exponents of the art of the Middle Ages. Its  buildings further contribute largely to the illustration of the history  of the country, by showing in their remains the condition and growth of  its religious ideas and observances at different epochs, and the manner  in which its civilisation advanced. We observe striking evidences of the  Irish influence in the relics of the primitive Celtic Church. The Norman  and English influences are clearly traceable up to the invasion of  Edward I., and the political connection with France and the Netherlands  is distinctly observable in the period of the Jameses.\"[7]      1. NORMAN ARCHITECTURE    The Abernethy Round Tower, the Priory of Restennet, Forfarshire, and St.  Regulus' or St. Rule's Church, St. Andrews, illustrate the transition  from Celtic to Norman architecture.[8] The dates of the Irish round  towers[9] extend from the ninth to the twelfth century, and the  Abernethy Tower is regarded on historical grounds by Dr. Skene as  belonging to the period about 870 A.D.; the upper windows and doorway  are either additions of the twelfth century, or, as this was an early  Irish house in Scotland, may illustrate what has been asserted, that in  Ireland a form of Romanesque was introduced before the Anglo-Saxon  Invasion.[10] At any rate, the tower is a combination of Celtic and  Norman work. As to Restennet, the present choir is a First Pointed  structure. David I. founded there an Augustinian Priory, which Malcolm  IV. made a cell of the Abbey of Jedburgh. The tower is the only one of  the square towers which has very marked features of a pre-Norman  character.[11] The building above the second story is probably  fifteenth-century work. St. Regulus' Church is treated pp. 17-19.    The twelfth century was in Scotland as elsewhere the great  church-building period, and the number of churches in the south and east  that reflect the Norman movement is very large. All the large ones were  conventual. Parish churches of the period are generally small and  aisleless--the most of them being single oblong chambers, with an  eastern chancel, sometimes with an eastern apse, and occasionally with a  western tower.[12] Towards the close of the period, the ornament became  very elaborate, especially in the arched heads of doorways. A common  feature was the arcade running round the walls below the windows, either  in the exterior, interior, or both; the caps and arches are generally  carved elaborately and richly with ornaments, the chevron or zig-zag  enrichment being a characteristic feature. The windows are always single  and simple in detail.[13]    Some of the towers connected with such churches are amongst the earliest  instances of Norman work which survive; they are simple in design,  square on plan, and are carried up, without break or buttress, to the  parapet, where they are finished with a gable roof, forming the  saddle-back arrangement still preserved in the Muthill Tower.[14] The  break in the height is formed by string courses, which mark the unequal  stories. A small wheel-stair usually leads to the top, and the doorway  is occasionally several feet from the ground. Such are the leading  features that can be traced in the buildings connected with the period.      2. SCOTTISH TRANSITION STYLE    The term \"transition\" is by general agreement reserved for the  architecture of the end of the twelfth century, when the Norman style  gradually gave place to the first"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],[0,"The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#4)"],[1,"nce, Spain, Portugal, Holland,  Sweden, Denmark, America; disgraceful treaties were entered into; and  annual tribute was paid by each of these, in the form of a costly  \"present\" to the Dey, for the purpose of securing immunity to their  trading vessels!  Whatever nation kept a consul at this nest and paid  \"black-mail\" passed scot free.  The nation that failed in these respects  was ruthlessly and systematically plundered--and this at the time when  Lord Nelson was scouring the ocean with mighty armaments; when our songs  lauded the wooden walls of old England to the skies; and when Great  Britain claimed to herself the proud title of \"Mistress of the Sea\"!  If  you doubt this, reader, let us assure you that all history asserts it,  that recorded facts confirm it, and that our proper attitude in regard  to it is to stand amazed, and admit that there are some things in this  curious world which \"no fellow can understand.\"    Without apologising for this digression, we return to the thread of our  tale.    Finding, then, as we have said, that the British merchantman was not a  legitimate foe, the corsair proceeded to look out for a more worthy  object of attack--namely, a vessel of some hapless petty state, which,  being too venturesome, or too poor to pay black-mail, was at war,  perforce, with the Algerines.  Fortune, however, ceased for a short time  to be propitious.  No suitable vessel was to be found, therefore Sidi  Hassan resolved to exercise the rights of the unusually free and  independent power of which he was a worthy representative in a somewhat  strange fashion.    Bearing down on the coast, he sailed along it for some time, with the  intention of making a bold dash at some small fishing village.  His mate  rather objected to this, knowing well that such attempts were too apt to  be attended with considerable loss of life; but Sidi Hassan was not a  man to be easily turned from his purpose.  The sight of a brig in the  offing, however, induced him to run out again to sea.  He was soon  within hail, and, finding that the vessel was a Sicilian trader, boarded  her at once.    No opposition was offered, the brig being totally without arms and her  crew small.  She, like the vessel of our friend Francisco, was laden  with wine and fruit.  There were only two passengers on board, but these  two were great prizes in Hassan's estimation, being beautiful girls of  about seventeen and eighteen respectively.  They were sisters--the elder  being on her way with her infant son to join her husband in Malta.    Hassan was glad of the opportunity thus thrown in his way of pleasing  his master the Dey of Algiers by presenting to him these unfortunates,  whose manners and appearance bespoke them ladies, and at once sent them  on board his vessel, along with their money and jewels.  Their wardrobe  was distributed among the pirate crew--the money and jewels being the  Dey's perquisite.    \"I have a plan in my head,\" said Hassan to his second in command, \"which  the capture of this brig has suggested to me.  Go, take charge of our  vessel, and send me twenty of the best men of our crew fully armed--also  a British Union-jack.  There is a captain of a port in this  neighbourhood against whom I have a special grudge, and to whom I would  fain give a free passage to Algiers! so make haste.\"    The order was soon executed, and the pirate-vessel ordered to remain  where she was while the brig stood inshore and sailed along the coast.  In a few hours she was off the port above referred to, when she hove-to,  hoisted the British flag, and fired a gun.  The captain of the port  innocently put off to the brig, and in a few minutes found himself and  his boat's crew taken captive by the Algerines!    Having thus successfully accomplished his design, Hassan returned to his  vessel, put a crew on board the second prize, and, directing his course  to Africa made all sail for the port of Algiers.    During the voyage the unfortunate captives saw little of each other,  nevertheless Mariano saw enough of the sisters, to create in his breast  feelings of the tenderest pity--especially for the younger sister, whom  he thought rather pretty than otherwise!  As for the Jew, he kept aloof  from all the captives, but seemed to have a good understanding with the  pirate captain, and to be acquainted with several of his men.        CHAPTER FOUR.    INTRODUCES THE READER TO THE PIRATE CITY, AND TO A FEW OF ITS  PECULIARITIES AND PRACTICES.    Permit us now, good reader, to introduce you to the top of a house in  Algiers.  The roofs of the houses in the Pirate City are flat--a most  admirable Eastern peculiarity which cannot be too strongly recommended  to Western builders.  They are, therefore, available as pleasant  \"terraces,\" on which you may rise above your cares, to lounge, and  smoke--if afflicted with the latter mania--and sip coffee with your  wife, (wives, if you be a Turk), or romp with your children--if not too  dignified--or cultivate flowers, or read in a state of elevated  serenity, or admire the magnificent view of the blue bay, backed by the  bluer Jurjura mountains, with the snow-topped range of the Lesser Atlas  beyond.  How much wiser thus to utilise one's house-top than to yield it  up, rent-free, to cats and sparrows!    Achmet Pasha, the Dey of Algiers at this time, or rather the  pirate-king, had a thorough appreciation of the roof of his palace, and  spent many hours daily on it, in consultation with his ministers, or in  converse with his wives.    As deys went, Achmet was a comparatively respectable man.  He thought no  more of cutting off a human head than of docking a rat's tail; but then  he did not take a particular pleasure in this employment, and was not  naturally cruel, which is more than could be said of many of his  predecessors.  He was also said to be a kind husband and a fond father,  but as no one, save the wives and children in question, knew anything of  the inner and private life of the palace, this must for ever remain a  matter of uncertainty.  There was no doubt, however, that he was a tall,  handsome, dignified man, in the prime of life, with a stern eye and a  pleasant expression of mouth; that, in character, he was bold and  resolute; and that, in his jewelled turban, gold-incrusted vestments,  and flowing Eastern robes, he looked resplendent.    Courage and resolution were, indeed, qualities without which a Dey of  Algiers could scarcely come into existence, because his high position,  not being hereditary, was naturally the ambitious goal of all the bold  spirits in the Turkish army of janissaries which held the city, with its  mixed Arab population, in subjection.  The most common mode of a change  of government was the strangulation of the reigning Dey by the man who  had power and party influence sufficient to enable him to ascend the  vacant throne.  Sometimes the throne thus obtained was held for only a  few days, or even hours, when it chanced that there were several  factions of pretty equal power, and two or three men of similar vigour  in the army.  It is a fact that on more than one occasion three Deys  have ascended and sat upon this undesirable throne within twenty-four  hours, each having been strangled or having had his head cut off by \"the  opposition\" soon after occupying his predecessor's warm seat!    Achmet, however, had reigned for a considerable period in peace, and was  on the whole a popular ruler.    At the time when we introduce him he was pacing the terrace, or roof of  the palace, with slow dignified steps, but with a troubled expression of  countenance.  His chief adviser, Sidi Omar, the Minister of Marine, and  one of the most unscrupulous and cunning men in the nest, walked beside  him.  They were attended and followed by a young but nearly full-grown  lion.  It was a common thing for the Deys and his chief officers to keep  lion-pups as pets, but as a rule these were chained up on becoming too  large to be safe playthings.  Achmet, however, being of a bold, reckless  nature, seemed to enjoy the occasional symptoms of alarm betrayed by his  attendants at sight of his overgrown pup, and kept it by him until, as  we have said, it was nearly full-grown.  He appeared to have no idea of  personal danger.  Possibly he did not believe the huge playful brute to  be capable of mischief.  Perhaps he felt confident in the keen edge of  his Damascene scimitar, and in the power of his arm to lop off even  leonine heads.  Whatever may have been the truth on this point, his ease  and indifference were evidently not shared by Sidi Omar.    That sly individual was a strong-bodied, middle-aged Turk of commanding  presence but sinister countenance, which latter was damaged by the loss  of an eye and a sabre-cut across the nose.    \"I have been asked,\" said Omar, continuing a conversation which had  already lasted some time, \"to beg that your highness will grant an  audience to the Spanish consul; he claims as countrywomen the two ladies  who have been just brought in by Sidi Hassan, but I advise that you  should refuse him.\"    \"Why so?\" asked Achmet.    \"Because, although there is, I believe, some ground for his claim, the  investigation of the question will only occasion useless trouble, as he  is unable to prove his case.\"    \"Nay, then, your last reason seems to me in favour of granting an  audience,\" returned the Dey, \"for if his plea be insufficient I shall  thus appear to be desirous of furthering justice without suffering loss.  It is always wise to act with urbanity when it costs one nothing.\"    Achmet smiled, and a gleam of mischievous fun twinkled in his eyes as he  observed his minister cast a furtive glance, suggestive of anything but  urbanity, at the lion, which had playfully brushed its tail against his  leg in passing.    \"Your highness's judgment is always just,\" returned Sidi Omar; \"and were  we desirous of maintaining peace with Spain at present, it would"]]]
