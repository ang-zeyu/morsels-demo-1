[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19289"],[0,"Some Answered Questions (#4)"],[1," the contrary, were always  defensive actions: a proof of this is that during thirteen years, in  Mecca, He and His followers endured the most violent persecutions. At this  period they were the target for the arrows of hatred: some of His  companions were killed and their property confiscated; others fled to  foreign lands. Muhammad Himself, after the most extreme persecutions by  the Quray_sh_ites, who finally resolved to kill Him, fled to Medina in the  middle of the night. Yet even then His enemies did not cease their  persecutions, but pursued Him to Medina, and His disciples even to  Abyssinia.    These Arab tribes were in the lowest depths of savagery and barbarism, and  in comparison with them the savages of Africa and wild Indians of America  were as advanced as a Plato. The savages of America do not bury their  children alive as these Arabs did their daughters, glorying in it as being  an honorable thing to do.(7) Thus many of the men would threaten their  wives, saying, \"If a daughter is born to you, I will kill you.\" Even down  to the present time the Arabs dread having daughters. Further, a man was  permitted to take a thousand women, and most husbands had more than ten  wives in their household. When these tribes made war, the one which was  victorious would take the women and children of the vanquished tribe  captive and treat them as slaves.    When a man who had ten wives died, the sons of these women rushed at each  other's mothers; and if one of the sons threw his mantle over the head of  his father's wife and cried out, \"This woman is my lawful property,\" at  once the unfortunate woman became his prisoner and slave. He could do  whatever he wished with her. He could kill her, imprison her in a well, or  beat, curse and torture her until death released her. According to the  Arab habits and customs, he was her master. It is evident that malignity,  jealousy, hatred and enmity must have existed between the wives and  children of a household, and it is, therefore, needless to enlarge upon  the subject. Again, consider what was the condition and life of these  oppressed women! Moreover, the means by which these Arab tribes lived  consisted in pillage and robbery, so that they were perpetually engaged in  fighting and war, killing one another, plundering and devastating each  other's property, and capturing women and children, whom they would sell  to strangers. How often it happened that the daughters and sons of a  prince, who spent their day in comfort and luxury, found themselves, when  night fell, reduced to shame, poverty and captivity. Yesterday they were  princes, today they are captives; yesterday they were great ladies, today  they are slaves.    Muhammad received the Divine Revelation among these tribes, and after  enduring thirteen years of persecution from them, He fled.(8) But this  people did not cease to oppress; they united to exterminate Him and all  His followers. It was under such circumstances that Muhammad was forced to  take up arms. This is the truth: we are not bigoted and do not wish to  defend Him, but we are just, and we say what is just. Look at it with  justice. If Christ Himself had been placed in such circumstances among  such tyrannical and barbarous tribes, and if for thirteen years He with  His disciples had endured all these trials with patience, culminating in  flight from His native land--if in spite of this these lawless tribes  continued to pursue Him, to slaughter the men, to pillage their property,  and to capture their women and children--what would have been Christ's  conduct with regard to them? If this oppression had fallen only upon  Himself, He would have forgiven them, and such an act of forgiveness would  have been most praiseworthy; but if He had seen that these cruel and  bloodthirsty murderers wished to kill, to pillage and to injure all these  oppressed ones, and to take captive the women and children, it is certain  that He would have protected them and would have resisted the tyrants.  What objection, then, can be taken to Muhammad's action? Is it this, that  He did not, with His followers, and their women and children, submit to  these savage tribes? To free these tribes from their bloodthirstiness was  the greatest kindness, and to coerce and restrain them was a true mercy.  They were like a man holding in his hand a cup of poison, which, when  about to drink, a friend breaks and thus saves him. If Christ had been  placed in similar circumstances, it is certain that with a conquering  power He would have delivered the men, women and children from the claws  of these bloodthirsty wolves.    Muhammad never fought against the Christians; on the contrary, He treated  them kindly and gave them perfect freedom. A community of Christian people  lived at Najran and were under His care and protection. Muhammad said, \"If  anyone infringes their rights, I Myself will be his enemy, and in the  presence of God I will bring a charge against him.\" In the edicts which He  promulgated it is clearly stated that the lives, properties and honor of  the Christians and Jews are under the protection of God; and that if a  Muhammadan married a Christian woman, the husband must not prevent her  from going to church, nor oblige her to veil herself; and that if she  died, he must place her remains in the care of the Christian clergy.  Should the Christians desire to build a church, Islam ought to help them.  In case of war between Islam and her enemies, the Christians should be  exempted from the obligation of fighting, unless they desired of their own  free will to do so in defense of Islam, because they were under its  protection. But as a compensation for this immunity, they should pay  yearly a small sum of money. In short, there are seven detailed edicts on  these subjects, some copies of which are still extant at Jerusalem. This  is an established fact and is not dependent on my affirmation. The edict  of the second Caliph(9) still exists in the custody of the orthodox  Patriarch of Jerusalem, and of this there is no doubt.(10)    Nevertheless, after a certain time, and through the transgression of both  the Muhammadans and the Christians, hatred and enmity arose between them.  Beyond this fact, all the narrations of the Muslims, Christians and others  are simply fabrications, which have their origin in fanaticism, or  ignorance, or emanate from intense hostility.    For example, the Muslims say that Muhammad cleft the moon, and that it  fell on the mountain of Mecca: they think that the moon is a small body  which Muhammad divided into two parts and threw one part on this mountain,  and the other part on another mountain.    Such stories are pure fanaticism. Also the traditions which the clergy  quote, and the incidents with which they find fault, are all exaggerated,  if not entirely without foundation.    Briefly, Muhammad appeared in the desert of Hijaz in the Arabian  Peninsula, which was a desolate, sterile wilderness, sandy and  uninhabited. Some parts, like Mecca and Medina, are extremely hot; the  people are nomads with the manners and customs of the dwellers in the  desert, and are entirely destitute of education and science. Muhammad  Himself was illiterate, and the Qur'an was originally written upon the  bladebones of sheep, or on palm leaves. These details indicate the  condition of the people to whom Muhammad was sent. The first question  which He put to them was, \"Why do you not accept the Pentateuch and the  Gospel, and why do you not believe in Christ and in Moses?\" This saying  presented difficulties to them, and they argued, \"Our forefathers did not  believe in the Pentateuch and the Gospel; tell us, why was this?\" He  answered, \"They were misled; you ought to reject those who do not believe  in the Pentateuch and the Gospel, even though they are your fathers and  your ancestors.\"    In such a country, and amidst such barbarous tribes, an illiterate Man  produced a book in which, in a perfect and eloquent style, He explained  the divine attributes and perfections, the prophethood of the Messengers  of God, the divine laws, and some scientific facts.    Thus, you know that before the observations of modern times--that is to  say, during the first centuries and down to the fifteenth century of the  Christian era--all the mathematicians of the world agreed that the earth  was the center of the universe, and that the sun moved. The famous  astronomer who was the protagonist of the new theory discovered the  movement of the earth and the immobility of the sun.(11) Until his time  all the astronomers and philosophers of the world followed the Ptolemaic  system, and whoever said anything against it was considered ignorant.  Though Pythagoras, and Plato during the latter part of his life, adopted  the theory that the annual movement of the sun around the zodiac does not  proceed from the sun, but rather from the movement of the earth around the  sun, this theory had been entirely forgotten, and the Ptolemaic system was  accepted by all mathematicians. But there are some verses revealed in the  Qur'an contrary to the theory of the Ptolemaic system. One of them is \"The  sun moves in a fixed place,\" which shows the fixity of the sun, and its  movement around an axis.(12) Again, in another verse, \"And each star moves  in its own heaven.\"(13) Thus is explained the movement of the sun, of the  moon, of the earth, and of other bodies. When the Qur'an appeared, all the  mathematicians ridiculed these statements and attributed the theory to  ignorance. Even the doctors of Islam, when they saw that these verses were  contrary to the accepted Ptolemaic system, were obliged to explain them  away.    It was not until after the fifteenth century of the Christian era, nearly  nine hundred years after Muhammad, that a famous astronomer made new  observations and important discoveries by the aid of the telescope, which  he had invented.(14) The rotation of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929"],[0,"The School for Scandal (#4)"],[1,"ons, but there is a sort of puny sickly Reputation,  that is always ailing yet will outlive the robuster characters of a  hundred Prudes.    SIR BENJAMIN. True Madam there are Valetudinarians in Reputation as well  as constitution--who being conscious of their weak Part, avoid the  least breath of air, and supply their want of Stamina by care and  circumspection--    MRS. CANDOUR. Well but this may be all mistake--You know, Sir Benjamin  very trifling circumstances often give rise to the most injurious Tales.    CRABTREE. That they do I'll be sworn Ma'am--did you ever hear how  Miss Shepherd came to lose her Lover and her Character last summer at  Tunbridge--Sir Benjamin you remember it--    SIR BENJAMIN. O to be sure the most whimsical circumstance--    LADY SNEERWELL. How was it Pray--    CRABTREE. Why one evening at Mrs. Ponto's Assembly--the conversation  happened to turn on the difficulty of breeding Nova-Scotia Sheep in  this country--says a young Lady in company[, \"]I have known instances  of it[--]for Miss Letitia Shepherd, a first cousin of mine, had a  Nova-Scotia Sheep that produced her Twins.[\"--\"]What![\"] cries the old  Dowager Lady Dundizzy (who you know is as deaf as a Post), [\"]has Miss  Letitia Shepherd had twins[\"]--This Mistake--as you may imagine, threw  the whole company into a fit of Laughing--However 'twas the next morning  everywhere reported and in a few Days believed by the whole Town, that  Miss Letitia Shepherd had actually been brought to Bed of a fine Boy  and Girl--and in less than a week there were People who could name the  Father, and the Farm House where the Babies were put out to Nurse.    LADY SNEERWELL. Strange indeed!    CRABTREE. Matter of Fact, I assure you--O Lud! Mr. Surface pray is it  true that your uncle Sir Oliver is coming home--    SURFACE. Not that I know of indeed Sir.    CRABTREE. He has been in the East Indies a long time--you can scarcely  remember him--I believe--sad comfort on his arrival to hear how your  Brother has gone on!    SURFACE. Charles has been imprudent Sir to be sure[;] but I hope no Busy  people have already prejudiced Sir Oliver against him--He may reform--    SIR BENJAMIN. To be sure He may--for my Part I never believed him to be  so utterly void of Principle as People say--and tho' he has lost all his  Friends I am told nobody is better spoken of--by the Jews.    CRABTREE. That's true egad nephew--if the Old Jewry was a Ward I believe  Charles would be an alderman--no man more popular there, 'fore Gad I  hear He pays as many annuities as the Irish Tontine and that whenever  He's sick they have Prayers for the recovery of his Health in the  synagogue--    SIR BENJAMIN. Yet no man lives in greater Splendour:--they tell me when  He entertains his Friends--He can sit down to dinner with a dozen of his  own Securities, have a score Tradesmen waiting in the Anti-Chamber, and  an officer behind every guest's Chair.    SURFACE. This may be entertainment to you Gentlemen but you pay very  little regard to the Feelings of a Brother.    MARIA. Their malice is intolerable--Lady Sneerwell I must wish you a  good morning--I'm not very well.         [Exit MARIA.]    MRS. CANDOUR. O dear she chang'd colour very much!    LADY SNEERWELL. Do Mrs. Candour follow her--she may want assistance.    MRS. CANDOUR. That I will with all my soul ma'am.--Poor dear Girl--who  knows--what her situation may be!         [Exit MRS. CANDOUR.]    LADY SNEERWELL. 'Twas nothing but that she could not bear to hear  Charles reflected on notwithstanding their difference.    SIR BENJAMIN. The young Lady's Penchant is obvious.    CRABTREE. But Benjamin--you mustn't give up the Pursuit for that--follow  her and put her into good humour--repeat her some of your verses--come,  I'll assist you--    SIR BENJAMIN. Mr. Surface I did not mean to hurt you--but depend on't  your Brother is utterly undone--         [Going.]    CRABTREE. O Lud! aye--undone--as ever man was--can't raise a guinea.    SIR BENJAMIN. And everything sold--I'm told--that was movable--         [Going.]    CRABTREE. I was at his house--not a thing left but some empty Bottles  that were overlooked and the Family Pictures, which I believe are framed  in the Wainscot.         [Going.]    SIR BENJAMIN. And I'm very sorry to hear also some bad stories against  him.         [Going.]    CRABTREE. O He has done many mean things--that's certain!    SIR BENJAMIN.

I doubt her Affections are farther engaged than we  imagin'd but the Family are to be here this Evening so you may as  well dine where you are and we shall have an opportunity of observing  farther--in the meantime, I'll go and plot Mischief and you shall study  Sentiments.

When an old Bachelor takes a young Wife--what is He to  expect--'Tis now six months since Lady Teazle made me the happiest  of men--and I have been the most miserable Dog ever since that ever  committed wedlock. We tift a little going to church--and came to a  Quarrel before the Bells had done ringing--I was more than once nearly  chok'd with gall during the Honeymoon--and had lost all comfort in Life  before my Friends had done wishing me Joy--yet I chose with caution--a  girl bred wholly in the country--who never knew luxury beyond one silk  gown--nor dissipation above the annual Gala of a Race-Ball--Yet she now  plays her Part in all the extravagant Fopperies of the Fashion and the  Town, with as ready a Grace as if she had never seen a Bush nor a  grass Plot out of Grosvenor-Square! I am sneered at by my old  acquaintance--paragraphed--in the news Papers--She dissipates my  Fortune, and contradicts all my Humours--yet the worst of it is I doubt  I love her or I should never bear all this. However I'll never be weak  enough to own it.         Enter ROWLEY    ROWLEY. Sir Peter, your servant:--how is 't with you Sir--    SIR PETER. Very bad--Master Rowley--very bad[.] I meet with nothing but  crosses and vexations--    ROWLEY. What can have happened to trouble you since yesterday?    SIR PETER. A good--question to a married man--    ROWLEY. Nay I'm sure your Lady Sir Peter can't be the cause of your  uneasiness.    SIR PETER. Why has anybody told you she was dead[?]    ROWLEY. Come, come, Sir Peter, you love her, notwithstanding your  tempers do not exactly agree.    SIR PETER. But the Fault is entirely hers, Master Rowley--I am myself,  the sweetest temper'd man alive, and hate a teasing temper; and so I  tell her a hundred Times a day--    ROWLEY. Indeed!    SIR PETER. Aye and what is very extraordinary in all our disputes she  is always in the wrong! But Lady Sneerwell, and the Set she meets at her  House, encourage the perverseness of her Disposition--then to complete  my vexations--Maria--my Ward--whom I ought to have the Power of a Father  over, is determined to turn Rebel too and absolutely refuses the man  whom I have long resolved on for her husband--meaning I suppose, to  bestow herself on his profligate Brother.    ROWLEY. You know Sir Peter I have always taken the Liberty to differ  with you on the subject of these two young Gentlemen--I only wish you  may not be deceived in your opinion of the elder. For Charles, my life  on't! He will retrieve his errors yet--their worthy Father, once my  honour'd master, was at his years nearly as wild a spark.    SIR PETER. You are wrong, Master Rowley--on their Father's Death you  know I acted as a kind of Guardian to them both--till their uncle Sir  Oliver's Eastern Bounty gave them an early independence. Of course no  person could have more opportunities of judging of their Hearts--and I  was never mistaken in my life. Joseph is indeed a model for the young  men of the Age--He is a man of Sentiment--and acts up to the Sentiments  he professes--but for the other[,] take my word for't [if] he had any  grain of Virtue by descent--he has dissipated it with the rest of his  inheritance. Ah! my old Friend, Sir Oliver will be deeply mortified when  he finds how Part of his Bounty has been misapplied.    ROWLEY. I am sorry to find you so violent against the young man because  this may be the most critical Period of his Fortune. I came hither with  news that will surprise you.    SIR PETER. What! let me hear--    ROWLEY. Sir Oliver is arrived and at this moment in Town.    SIR PETER. How!--you astonish me--I thought you did not expect him this  month!--    ROWLEY. I did not--but his Passage has been remarkably quick.    SIR PETER. Egad I shall rejoice to see my old Friend--'Tis sixteen years  since we met--We have had many a Day together--but does he still enjoin  us not to inform his Nephews of his Arrival?    ROWLEY. Most strictly--He means, before He makes it known to make some  trial of their Dispositions and we have already planned something for  the purpose.    SIR PETER. Ah there needs no art to discover their merits--however he  shall have his way--but pray does he know I am married!    ROWLEY. Yes and will soon wish you joy.    SIR PETER. You may tell him 'tis too late--ah Oliver will laugh at  me--we used to rail at matrimony together--but He has been steady to his  Text--well He must be at my house tho'--I'll instantly give orders for  his Reception--but Master Rowley--don't drop a word that Lady Teazle and  I ever disagree.    ROWLEY. By no means.    SIR PETER. For I should never be able to stand Noll's jokes; so I'd have  him think that we are a very happy couple.    ROWLEY. I understand you--but then you must be very careful not to  differ while He's in the House with you.    SIR PETER. Egad--and so we must--that's"]]]
