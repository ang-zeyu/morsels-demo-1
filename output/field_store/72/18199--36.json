My father knew of one who was taken as a small boy, who never yielded  to the priests under the most hideous tortures. As he was a very  bright boy, the priests were particularly eager to convert him. They  tried him with bribes that would appeal to his ambition. They promised  to make a great man of him--a general, a noble. The boy turned away  and said his prayers. Then they tortured him, and threw him into a  cell; and when he lay asleep from exhaustion, the priest came and  baptized him. When he awoke, they told him he was a Christian, and  brought him the crucifix to kiss. He protested, threw the crucifix  from him, but they held him to it that he was a baptized Jew, and  belonged to the Church; and the rest of his life he spent between the  prison and the hospital, always clinging to his faith, saying the  Hebrew prayers in defiance of his tormentors, and paying for it with  his flesh.    There were men in Polotzk whose faces made you old in a minute. They  had served Nicholas I, and come back unbaptized. The white church in  the square--how did it look to them? I knew. I cursed the church in my  heart every time I had to pass it; and I was afraid--afraid.    On market days, when the peasants came to church, and the bells kept  ringing by the hour, my heart was heavy in me, and I could find no  rest. Even in my father's house I did not feel safe. The church bell  boomed over the roofs of the houses, calling, calling, calling. I  closed my eyes, and saw the people passing into the church: peasant  women with bright embroidered aprons and glass beads; barefoot little  girls with colored kerchiefs on their heads; boys with caps pulled too  far down over their flaxen hair; rough men with plaited bast sandals,  and a rope around the waist,--crowds of them, moving slowly up the  steps, crossing themselves again and again, till they were swallowed  by the black doorway, and only the beggars were left squatting on the  steps. _Boom, boom!_ What are the people doing in the dark, with the  waxen images and the horrid crucifixes? _Boom, boom, boom!_ They are  ringing the bell for me. Is it in the church they will torture me,  when I refuse to kiss the cross?    They ought not to have told me those dreadful stories. They were long  past; we were living under the blessed \"New Regime.\" Alexander III was  no friend of the Jews; still he did not order little boys to be taken  from their mothers, to be made into soldiers and Christians. Every man  had to serve in the army for four years, and a Jewish recruit was  likely to be treated with severity, no matter if his behavior were  perfect; but that was little compared to the dreadful conditions of  the old regime.    The thing that really mattered was the necessity of breaking the  Jewish laws of daily life while in the service. A soldier often had to  eat trefah and work on Sabbath. He had to shave his beard and do  reverence to Christian things. He could not attend daily services at  the synagogue; his private devotions were disturbed by the jeers and  insults of his coarse Gentile comrades. He might resort to all sorts  of tricks and shams, still he was obliged to violate Jewish law. When  he returned home, at the end of his term of service, he could not rid  himself of the stigma of those enforced sins. For four years he had  led the life of a Gentile.    Piety alone was enough to make the Jews dread military service, but  there were other things that made it a serious burden. Most men of  twenty-one--the age of conscription--were already married and had  children. During their absence their families suffered, their business  often was ruined. At the end of their term they were beggars. As  beggars, too, they were sent home from their military post. If they  happened to have a good uniform at the time of their dismissal, it was  stripped from them, and replaced by a shabby one. They received a free  ticket for the return journey, and a few kopecks a day for expenses.  In this fashion they were hurried back into the Pale, like escaped  prisoners. The Czar was done with them. If within a limited time they  were found outside the Pale, they would be seized and sent home in  chains.    There were certain exceptions to the rule of compulsory service. The  only son of a family was exempt, and certain others. In the physical  examination preceding conscription, many were rejected on account of  various faults. This gave the people the idea of inflicting injuries  on themselves, so as to produce temporary deformities on account of  which they might be rejected at the examination. Men would submit to  operations on their eyes, ears, or limbs, which caused them horrible  sufferings, in the hope of escaping the service. If the operation was  successful, the patient was rejected by the examining officers, and in  a short time he was well, and a free man. Often, however, the  deformity intended to be temporary proved incurable, so that there  were many men in Polotzk blind of one eye, or hard of hearing, or  lame, as a result of these secret practices; but these things were  easier to bear than the memory of four years in the Czar's service.    Sons of rich fathers could escape service without leaving any marks on  their persons. It was always possible to bribe conscription officers.  This was a dangerous practice,--it was not the officers who suffered  most in case the negotiations leaked out,--but no respectable family  would let a son be taken as a recruit till it had made every effort to  save him. My grandfather nearly ruined himself to buy his sons out of  service; and my mother tells thrilling anecdotes of her younger  brother's life, who for years lived in hiding, under assumed names and  in various disguises, till he had passed the age of liability for  service.    If it were cowardice that made the Jews shrink from military service  they would not inflict on themselves physical tortures greater than  any that threatened them in the army, and which often left them maimed  for life. If it were avarice--the fear of losing the gains from their  business for four years--they would not empty their pockets and sell  their houses and sink into debt, on the chance of successfully bribing  the Czar's agents. The Jewish recruit dreaded, indeed, brutality and  injustice at the hands of officers and comrades; he feared for his  family, which he left, often enough, as dependents on the charity of  relatives; but the fear of an unholy life was greater than all other  fears. I know, for I remember my cousin who was taken as a soldier.  Everything had been done to save him. Money had been spent freely--my  uncle did not stop at his unmarried daughter's portion, when  everything else was gone. My cousin had also submitted to some secret  treatment,--some devastating drug administered for months before the  examination,--but the effects were not pronounced enough, and he was  passed. For the first few weeks his company was stationed in Polotzk.  I saw my cousin drill on the square, carrying a gun, _on a Sabbath_. I  felt unholy, as if I had sinned the sin in my own person. It was easy  to understand why mothers of conscript sons fasted and wept and prayed  and worried themselves to their graves.    There was a man in our town called David the Substitute, because he  had gone as a soldier in another's stead, he himself being exempt. He  did it for a sum of money. I suppose his family was starving, and he  saw a chance to provide for them for a few years. But it was a sinful  thing to do, to go as a soldier and be obliged to live like a Gentile,  of his own free will. And David knew how wicked it was, for he was a  pious man at heart. When he returned from service, he was aged and  broken, bowed down with the sense of his sins. And he set himself a  penance, which was to go through the streets every Sabbath morning,  calling the people to prayer. Now this was a hard thing to do,  because David labored bitterly all the week, exposed to the weather,  summer or winter; and on Sabbath morning there was nobody so tired and  lame and sore as David. Yet he forced himself to leave his bed before  it was yet daylight, and go from street to street, all over Polotzk,  calling on the people to wake and go to prayer. Many a Sabbath morning  I awoke when David called, and lay listening to his voice as it passed  and died out; and it was so sad that it hurt, as beautiful music  hurts. I was glad to feel my sister lying beside me, for it was lonely  in the gray dawn, with only David and me awake, and God waiting for  the people's prayers.    The Gentiles used to wonder at us because we cared so much about  religious things,--about food, and Sabbath, and teaching the children  Hebrew. They were angry with us for our obstinacy, as they called it,  and mocked us and ridiculed the most sacred things. There were wise  Gentiles who understood. These were educated people, like Fedora  Pavlovna, who made friends with their Jewish neighbors. They were  always respectful, and openly admired some of our ways. But most of  the Gentiles were ignorant and distrustful and spiteful. They would  not believe that there was any good in our religion, and of course we  dared not teach them, because we should be accused of trying to  convert them, and that would be the end of us.    Oh, if they could only understand! Vanka caught me on the street one  day, and pulled my hair, and called me names; and all of a sudden I  asked myself _why_--_why?_--a thing I had stopped asking years before.  I was so angry that I could have punished him; for one moment I was  not afraid to hit back. But this _why_--_why?_ broke out in my heart,  and I forgot to revenge myself. It was so wonderful--Well, there were  no words in my head to say it, but it meant that Vanka abused me only  because _he did not understand_. If he could feel with my heart, if he  could be a little Jewish "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20897"],[0,"A Short History of England (#4)"],[1," to the future the more he must endure of ignorance  and privilege. All we call reason was one with all we call reaction. And  this is the clue which we must carry with us through the lives of all  the great men of the Dark Ages; of Alfred, of Bede, of Dunstan. If the  most extreme modern Republican were put back in that period he would be  an equally extreme Papist or even Imperialist. For the Pope was what was  left of the Empire; and the Empire what was left of the Republic.    We may compare the man of that time, therefore, to one who has left free  cities and even free fields behind him, and is forced to advance towards  a forest. And the forest is the fittest metaphor, not only because it  was really that wild European growth cloven here and there by the Roman  roads, but also because there has always been associated with forests  another idea which increased as the Roman order decayed. The idea of the  forests was the idea of enchantment. There was a notion of things being  double or different from themselves, of beasts behaving like men and not  merely, as modern wits would say, of men behaving like beasts. But it is  precisely here that it is most necessary to remember that an age of  reason had preceded the age of magic. The central pillar which has  sustained the storied house of our imagination ever since has been the  idea of the civilized knight amid the savage enchantments; the  adventures of a man still sane in a world gone mad.    The next thing to note in the matter is this: that in this barbaric time  none of the _heroes_ are barbaric. They are only heroes if they are  anti-barbaric. Men real or mythical, or more probably both, became  omnipresent like gods among the people, and forced themselves into the  faintest memory and the shortest record, exactly in proportion as they  had mastered the heathen madness of the time and preserved the Christian  rationality that had come from Rome. Arthur has his name because he  killed the heathen; the heathen who killed him have no names at all.  Englishmen who know nothing of English history, but less than nothing of  Irish history, have heard somehow or other of Brian Boru, though they  spell it Boroo and seem to be under the impression that it is a joke. It  is a joke the subtlety of which they would never have been able to  enjoy, if King Brian had not broken the heathen in Ireland at the great  Battle of Clontarf. The ordinary English reader would never have heard  of Olaf of Norway if he had not \"preached the Gospel with his sword\"; or  of the Cid if he had not fought against the Crescent. And though Alfred  the Great seems to have deserved his title even as a personality, he was  not so great as the work he had to do.    But the paradox remains that Arthur is more real than Alfred. For the  age is the age of legends. Towards these legends most men adopt by  instinct a sane attitude; and, of the two, credulity is certainly much  more sane than incredulity. It does not much matter whether most of the  stories are true; and (as in such cases as Bacon and Shakespeare) to  realize that the question does not matter is the first step towards  answering it correctly. But before the reader dismisses anything like an  attempt to tell the earlier history of the country by its legends, he  will do well to keep two principles in mind, both of them tending to  correct the crude and very thoughtless scepticism which has made this  part of the story so sterile. The nineteenth-century historians went on  the curious principle of dismissing all people of whom tales are told,  and concentrating upon people of whom nothing is told. Thus, Arthur is  made utterly impersonal because all legends are lies, but somebody of  the type of Hengist is made quite an important personality, merely  because nobody thought him important enough to lie about. Now this is to  reverse all common sense. A great many witty sayings are attributed to  Talleyrand which were really said by somebody else. But they would not  be so attributed if Talleyrand had been a fool, still less if he had  been a fable. That fictitious stories are told about a person is, nine  times out of ten, extremely good evidence that there was somebody to  tell them about. Indeed some allow that marvellous things were done, and  that there may have been a man named Arthur at the time in which they  were done; but here, so far as I am concerned, the distinction becomes  rather dim. I do not understand the attitude which holds that there was  an Ark and a man named Noah, but cannot believe in the existence of  Noah's Ark.    The other fact to be remembered is that scientific research for the last  few years has worked steadily in the direction of confirming and not  dissipating the legends of the populace. To take only the obvious  instance, modern excavators with modern spades have found a solid stone  labyrinth in Crete, like that associated with the Minataur, which was  conceived as being as cloudy a fable as the Chimera. To most people this  would have seemed quite as frantic as finding the roots of Jack's  Beanstalk or the skeletons in Bluebeard's cupboard, yet it is simply the  fact. Finally, a truth is to be remembered which scarcely ever is  remembered in estimating the past. It is the paradox that the past is  always present: yet it is not what was, but whatever seems to have been;  for all the past is a part of faith. What did they believe of their  fathers? In this matter new discoveries are useless because they are  new. We may find men wrong in what they thought they were, but we cannot  find them wrong in what they thought they thought. It is therefore very  practical to put in a few words, if possible, something of what a man of  these islands in the Dark Ages would have said about his ancestors and  his inheritance. I will attempt here to put some of the simpler things  in their order of importance as he would have seen them; and if we are  to understand our fathers who first made this country anything like  itself, it is most important that we should remember that if this was  not their real past, it was their real memory.    After that blessed crime, as the wit of mystics called it, which was for  these men hardly second to the creation of the world, St. Joseph of  Arimathea, one of the few followers of the new religion who seem to  have been wealthy, set sail as a missionary, and after long voyages came  to that litter of little islands which seemed to the men of the  Mediterranean something like the last clouds of the sunset. He came up  upon the western and wilder side of that wild and western land, and made  his way to a valley which through all the oldest records is called  Avalon. Something of rich rains and warmth in its westland meadows, or  something in some lost pagan traditions about it, made it persistently  regarded as a kind of Earthly Paradise. Arthur, after being slain at  Lyonesse, is carried here, as if to heaven. Here the pilgrim planted his  staff in the soil; and it took root as a tree that blossoms on Christmas  Day.    A mystical materialism marked Christianity from its birth; the very soul  of it was a body. Among the stoical philosophies and oriental negations  that were its first foes it fought fiercely and particularly for a  supernatural freedom to cure concrete maladies by concrete substances.  Hence the scattering of relics was everywhere like the scattering of  seed. All who took their mission from the divine tragedy bore tangible  fragments which became the germs of churches and cities. St. Joseph  carried the cup which held the wine of the Last Supper and the blood of  the Crucifixion to that shrine in Avalon which we now call Glastonbury;  and it became the heart of a whole universe of legends and romances, not  only for Britain but for Europe. Throughout this tremendous and  branching tradition it is called the Holy Grail. The vision of it was  especially the reward of that ring of powerful paladins whom King Arthur  feasted at a Round Table, a symbol of heroic comradeship such as was  afterwards imitated or invented by mediaeval knighthood. Both the cup and  the table are of vast importance emblematically in the psychology of the  chivalric experiment. The idea of a round table is not merely  universality but equality. It has in it, modified of course, by other  tendencies to differentiation, the same idea that exists in the very  word \"peers,\" as given to the knights of Charlemagne. In this the Round  Table is as Roman as the round arch, which might also serve as a type;  for instead of being one barbaric rock merely rolled on the others, the  king was rather the keystone of an arch. But to this tradition of a  level of dignity was added something unearthly that was from Rome, but  not of it; the privilege that inverted all privileges; the glimpse of  heaven which seemed almost as capricious as fairyland; the flying  chalice which was veiled from the highest of all the heroes, and which  appeared to one knight who was hardly more than a child.    Rightly or wrongly, this romance established Britain for after centuries  as a country with a chivalrous past. Britain had been a mirror of  universal knighthood. This fact, or fancy, is of colossal import in all  ensuing affairs, especially the affairs of barbarians. These and  numberless other local legends are indeed for us buried by the forests  of popular fancies that have grown out of them. It is all the harder for  the serious modern mind because our fathers felt at home with these  tales, and therefore took liberties with them. Probably the rhyme which  runs,           \"When good King Arthur ruled this land       He was a noble king,       He stole three pecks of barley meal,\"      is much nearer the true mediaeval note than the aristocratic stateliness  of Tennyson. But about all these grotesques of the popular fancy there  is one last thing to be remembered. It must especially be remembered by  those who"]]]
