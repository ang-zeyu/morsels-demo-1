How the New World came to be called America.--But not many years  after this the New World received the name by which we now call it.  An Italian navigator whose first name was Amerigo[10] made a voyage  to it after it had been discovered by Columbus and the Cabots. He  wrote an account of what he saw, and as this was the first printed  description of the continent, it was named from him, AMERICA.    [Footnote 10: Amerigo (A-ma-ree'go): his full name was Amerigo  Vespucci (A-ma-ree'go Ves-poot'chee), or, as he wrote it in Latin,  Americus Vespucius.]      27. Summary.--In 1497 John Cabot and his son, from Bristol, England,  discovered the mainland or continent of North America, and took  possession of it for England. The next year they came over and sailed  along the eastern coast of what is now the United States.    An Italian whose first name was Amerigo visited the New World  afterward and wrote the first account of the mainland which was  printed. For this reason the whole continent was named after him,  AMERICA.      Who was John Cabot? What did he try to do? Who sailed with him?  What land did they see? Had Columbus ever seen it? What did Cabot  do when he went on shore? What is said of his return to Bristol? What  did the Cabots carry back to England? What is said about the second  voyage of the Cabots? How did the New World come to be called America?          PONCE DE LEON,[1] BALBOA,[2] AND DE SOTO[3]  (Period of Discovery, 1513-1542).      28. The magic fountain; Ponce de Leon discovers Florida; Balboa  discovers the Pacific Ocean.--The Indians on the West India Islands  believed that there was a wonderful fountain in a land to the west  of them. They said that if an old man should bathe in its waters,  they would make him a boy again. Ponce de Leon, a Spanish soldier  who was getting gray and wrinkled, set out to find this magic fountain,  for he thought that there was more fun in being a boy than in growing  old.    He did not find the fountain, and so his hair grew grayer than ever  and his wrinkles grew deeper. But in 1513 he discovered a land bright  with flowers, which he named Florida.[4] He took possession of it  for Spain.    The same year another Spaniard, named Balboa, set out to explore the  Isthmus of Panama.[5] One day he climbed to the top of a very high  hill, and discovered that vast ocean--the greatest of all the oceans  of the globe--which we call the Pacific.    [Footnote 1: Ponce de Leon (Pon'thay day La-on') or, in English, Pons  de Lee'on. Many persons now prefer the English pronunciation of all  these Spanish names.]    [Footnote 2: Balboa (Bal-bo'ah).]    [Footnote 3: De Soto (Da So'to).]    [Footnote 4: Florida: this word means flowery; the name was given  by the Spaniards because they discovered the country on Easter Sunday,  which they call Flowery Easter.]    [Footnote 5: Panama (Pan-a-mah').]      29. De Soto discovers the Mississippi.--Long after Balboa and Ponce  de Leon were dead, a Spaniard named De Soto landed in Florida and  marched through the country in search of gold mines.    In the course of his long and weary wanderings, he came to a river  more than a mile across. The Indians told him it was the Mississippi,  or the Great River. In discovering it, De Soto had found the largest  river in North America; he had also found his own grave, for he died  shortly after, and was secretly buried at midnight in its muddy  waters.    [Illustration: BURIAL OF DE SOTO.]      30. The Spaniards build St. Augustine;[6] we buy Florida in  1819.--More than twenty years after the burial of De Soto, a Spanish  soldier named Menendez[7] went to Florida and built a fort on the  eastern coast. This was in 1565. The fort became the centre of a  settlement named St. Augustine. It is the oldest city built by white  men, not only in what is now the United States, but in all North  America.    [Illustration: OLD SPANISH GATEWAY AT ST. AUGUSTINE. (Called the  \"City Gate.\")]    In 1819, or more than two hundred and fifty years after St. Augustine  was begun, Spain sold Florida to the United States.    [Footnote 6: St. Augustine (Sant Aw'gus-teen').]    [Footnote 7: Menendez (Ma-nen'deth).]      31. Summary.--Ponce de Leon discovered Florida; another Spaniard,  named Balboa, discovered the Pacific; still another, named De Soto,  discovered the Mississippi. In 1565 the Spaniards began to build St.  Augustine in Florida. It is the oldest city built by white men in  the United States or in all North America.      What is said about a magic fountain? What did Ponce De Leon do? What  is said about Balboa? What about De Soto? What did Menendez do in  Florida? What is said of St. Augustine?          SIR WALTER RALEIGH[1]  (1552-1618).      32. Walter Raleigh sends two ships to America; how the Indians  received the Englishmen.--Although John Cabot discovered the  continent of North America in 1497 and took possession of the land  for the English,[2] yet the English themselves did not try to settle  here until nearly a hundred years later.    Then (1584) a young man named Walter Raleigh, who was a great favorite  of Queen Elizabeth's, sent out two ships to America. The captains  of these vessels landed on Roanoke[3] Island, on the coast of what  is now the state of North Carolina. They found the island covered  with tall red cedars and with vines thick with clusters of wild grapes.  The Indians called this place the \"Good Land.\" They were pleased to  see the Englishmen, and they invited them to a great feast of roast  turkey, venison,[4] melons, and nuts.    [Illustration: Map showing Roanoke Island.]    [Footnote 1: Raleigh (Raw'li).]    [Footnote 2: See paragraph 22.]    [Footnote 3: Roanoke (Ro-a-nok').]    [Footnote 4: Venison (ven'i-zon or ven'zon): deer meat.]      33. Queen Elizabeth names the country Virginia; first settlers; what  they sent Walter Raleigh.--When the two captains returned to England,  Queen Elizabeth--the \"Virgin Queen,\" as she was called--was  delighted with what she heard of the \"Good Land.\" She named it  Virginia in honor of herself. She also gave Raleigh a title of honor.  From that time he was no longer called plain Walter Raleigh or Mr.  Raleigh, but Sir Walter Raleigh.    Sir Walter now (1585) shipped over emigrants[5] to settle in Virginia.  They sent back to him as a present two famous American plants--one  called Tobacco, the other the Potato. The queen had given Sir Walter  a fine estate in Ireland, and he set out both the plants in his garden.  The tobacco plant did not grow very well there, but the potato did;  and after a time thousands of farmers began to raise that vegetable,  not only in Ireland, but in England too. As far back then as that  time--or more than three hundred years ago--America was beginning  to feed the people of the Old World.    [Illustration: THE FIRST PIPE OF TOBACCO. (Raleigh's servant thought  his master was on fire.)]    [Footnote 5: Emigrants: persons who leave one country to go and  settle in another. Thousands of emigrants from Europe now land in  this country every month.]      34. The Virginia settlement destroyed.--Sir Walter spent immense  sums of money on his settlement in Virginia, but it did not succeed.  One of the settlers, named Dare, had a daughter born there. He named  her Virginia Dare. She was the first English child born in America.  But the little girl, with her father and mother and all the rest of  the settlers, disappeared. It is supposed that they were either  killed by the Indians or that they wandered away and starved to death;  but all that we really know is that not one of them was ever seen  again.      35. Last days of Sir Walter Raleigh.--After Queen Elizabeth died,  King James the First became ruler of England. He accused Sir Walter  of trying to take away his crown so as to make some one else ruler  over the country. Sir Walter was sent to prison and kept there for  many years. At last King James released him in order to send him to  South America to get gold. When Sir Walter returned to London without  any gold, the greedy king accused him of having disobeyed him because  he had fought with some Spaniards. Raleigh was condemned to death  and beheaded.    But Sir Walter's attempt to settle Virginia led other Englishmen to  try. Before he died they built a town, called Jamestown, on the coast.  We shall presently read the history of that town. The English held  Virginia from that time until it became part of the United States.      36. Summary.--Sir Walter Raleigh sent over men from England to  explore the coast of America. Queen Elizabeth named the country they  visited Virginia. Raleigh then shipped emigrants over to make a  settlement. These emigrants sent him two American plants, Tobacco  and the Potato; and in that way the people of Great Britain and  Ireland came to like both. Sir Walter's settlement failed, but his  example led other Englishmen to try to make one. Before he was  beheaded they succeeded.      What is said about Walter Raleigh? What is said about the Indians?  What name did Queen Elizabeth give to the country? What did she do  for Walter Raleigh? What did Sir Walter then do? What American plants  did the emigrants send him? What did he do with those plants? What  happened to the Virginia settlement? What is said of the last days  of Sir Walter Raleigh? Did Sir Walter's attempt to settle Virginia  do any good?          CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH  (1579-1631).      37. New and successful attempt to make a settlement in Virginia;  Captain John Smith.--One of the leaders in the new expedition sent  out to make a settlement in Virginia, while Raleigh was in prison,  was Captain John Smith. He began life as a clerk in England. Not  liking his work, he ran away and turned soldier. After many strange  adventures, he was captured by the Turks and sold as a slave. His  master, who was a Turk, riveted a heavy iron collar around his neck"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#4)"],[1,"with the heavier articles at the top. These,  crushing the lighter and more fragile packages beneath, spread the  contents of the latter in the roadway to serve as sport for gamins and  other loungers who prowled around.    The utter chaos was aggravated by the rain which pelted down with  torrential fury. Mothers with their little children drew closely into  corners or sat upon doorsteps seeking the slightest shelter. As I turned  out of the station my attention was attracted by a woman--she had come  up on our train--who was sitting on the kerb, her feet in the gutter,  the rushing water coursing over her ankles, feeding her child at the  breast, and vainly striving to shelter the little mite from the  elements. The woman was crying bitterly. I went up to her. She spoke  English perfectly. She was Russian and had set out from England to meet  her husband at Kalish. But she could not get through, she had very  little money, could not speak German, and knew not what to do, or what  would become of her. I soothed her as well as I could. There were  hundreds of similar cases around. Notwithstanding their terrible plight  not a hand was moved by the authorities on their behalf. They were even  spurned and roughly moved out of the way by the swaggering officials. It  was not until the British colony got busy the next day that they  received the slightest alleviation, and the majority, being strangers  in a strange land, were sent back to England, the Germans mutely  concurring in the task. The wild rush from the Continent may have  precipitated congestion at our ports and railway stations, but there  never could have been that absolute chaos which reigned at Berlin on the  fateful night of the 2nd of August. Humanity was thrown to the four  winds. The much-vaunted Teuton organisation, system, and scientific  control had broken down completely under the first test to which it was  subjected.    The terrific downpour caused me to decide to spend a few hours in the  comfort of an hotel. I hailed a taxi and jumped in. The car was just  moving when the door was flung open, I was grabbed by the coat-collar  and the next moment found myself skating across the roadway on my back.  I jumped up, somewhat ruffled at this rude handling, to learn that it  was an officer who had treated me so unceremoniously. I had no redress.  Berlin was under martial law. The uniform of the military came before  the mufti of the civilian.    Unable to find another vehicle I turned into the first place I found  open. It was an all-night cafe. It was packed to suffocation with German  soldiers and the feminine underworld of Berlin. There was a glorious  orgy of drunkenness, nauseating and debasing amusement, and the  incoherent singing of patriotic songs. The other sex appeared to have  thrown all discretion and womanliness to the winds. A soldier too drunk  to stand was assisted to a chair which he mounted with difficulty. Here  he was supported on either side by two flushed, hilariously-shouting,  partially-dressed harpies. He drew off his belt--his helmet had already  gone somewhere--and pointing to the badge he shouted thickly and  coarsely, \"Deutschland, Deutschland, Gott mit uns\"--(Germany, Germany,  God is with us). Metaphorically he was correct, because the words are  printed upon the belt of every German soldier, but if the Almighty was  with that drunken, debased crowd that night, then Old Nick must have  been wearing out his shoes looking for a job.    When the crowd caught sight of me, which was some time after my entrance  because I had dropped unseen into a convenient corner, they rushed  forward and urged me to participate in their revels. I declined. They  had been hurling distinctly uncomplimentary and obscene epithets  concerning Britain through the room. My decision was construed into an  affront to the All-Highest. A big, burly, drunken soldier wanted to  fight me. The crowd pressed round keenly anticipating some fun. We  indulged in a spirited altercation, but as neither understood what the  other said, words did not lead to blows. However, the upshot was the  intimation that my room was preferred to my company. This was received  with enthusiasm, the result being that I made the sudden acquaintance of  the pavement outside once more, being assisted in my hurried departure  by fisticuffs and heavy boots.    I picked myself up and walked until I caught sight of an hotel. I  entered, booked a room, and indulged in an elaborate wash and brush-up  of which I was sorely in need, following this with a substantial  breakfast. Then I sauntered into the vestibule for a smoke. Three German  officers and a squad of soldiers came clanking in. There was a short  sharp order. One officer remained at the door while the others  disappeared into the depths of the building.    I went over to the officer and entered into conversation with him. He  spoke English fluently and was fairly affable. We discussed things in  general and also the political situation, from which I gathered that  matters were rapidly approaching a climax, and that there was no telling  what would happen next. This was the first time I had been brought face  to face with the situation and my outlook was serious. The officer at  last turned to me, and with a friendly smile, remarked--    \"Look here, my English friend, I would advise you to make for your  country at once. Don't stop for anything!\"    \"Why?\"    \"Don't ask questions. Do as I say! Can't you take a friendly warning?  Take to-day's train home! If you don't--well, you may be detained!\"    His advice was expressed in such significant tones that I looked at him  sharply. He answered with another smile and a shrug which intimated only  too plainly that he had said as much as he dared.    I was debarred from prosecuting the conversation farther by the return  of his comrades with a crowd of waiters. They were all Russians and they  had been rounded up by the military. No opportunity was given them to  pack a few necessities. They were arrested at their tables, while  performing their duties, were corralled and now were off to prison. No  one possessed any more than he stood up in.    I followed them down the street, intending to proceed to the British  Consulate. The streets were full of soldiers and the air rang with  martial music. While proceeding to the Consulate I became aware that I  was being shadowed. An individual resolutely dogged me. I had seen him  previously but had taken no serious notice of his presence. Now he began  to get a bit irksome. I bought some picture post-cards and addressed  them to friends at home, announcing my immediate return, also  introducing brief comments on the condition of things in Berlin as they  appeared to me. A few hours later I regretted writing those  post-cards.[2]        [Footnote 2: Upon my return to England I made enquiries and      discovered that not a single one had been received. Undoubtedly      they were stopped by the German military authorities and      contributed somewhat materially to my subsequent      troubles.--H.C.M.]    The Consulate was besieged by hundreds of compatriots thirsting for  guidance as to what to do. After waiting an hour-and-a-half I secured an  audience. I briefly explained my position.    \"Get home at once. The train leaves 1.13 mid-day.\"    \"But I've got luggage worth L400 at the station!\"    \"Get home!\"    \"But--\"    \"Leave your luggage where it is!\"    \"Do you think--?\"    \"You take the 1.13 train. Good morning.\"    Further enquiries convinced me that the 1.13 was very likely to be the  last train which would leave Berlin for Britain, so I scurried off to  the station to recover my luggage. Many of the photographic instruments  were exceedingly valuable because they had been made specially. I was  bandied from one official to another. At last I alighted upon one who  knew something. He led me to a huge building and flung open the door. It  was stacked from floor to roof with baggage, which had been packed in  without any semblance of order. I surveyed the pile ruefully. I asked  him if he could trace my luggage but he shook his head. I held out a  tempting pourboire. It was of no avail. If I wanted the luggage I could  look for it myself. Reflecting that some six weeks at least would be  required to complete the search I concluded that I should have to leave  it behind willy-nilly. So somewhat depressed I prepared to leave by the  1.13 train.    The express was heavily laden and to it was attached a carriage reserved  for the military, who were accompanying the departing Britishers to the  frontier. Curiously enough, not one of us knew definitely what had  happened. Rumour was busy, but it was inconclusive. The general feeling  was that Britain had taken some drastic action which must have serious  results, otherwise we should not have been bundled home so hurriedly.    We had been travelling some time when I noticed a lady sauntering along  the corridor vainly searching for a seat. I was comfortable, but I  instantly surrendered my place to assume a standing position in the  corridor where I chatted with several fellow-travellers. I may say that  slung over my shoulder was a black leather strap carrying a small camera  case in the manner frequently affected by tourists. Ever after I have  cursed that innocent looking camera case, and certainly when travelling  in the future will favour some other means of carrying photographic  apparatus.    About half-an-hour passed in this way. Then I observed a young German  ambling along the corridor. He came up to us and entered into an idle  conversation. One by one the others dropped away from him, not caring to  talk with a German. I would have done the same but the strange youth  would not let me. He pinned me to the spot with his conversation. At  first his questions were extremely innocent, but they soon became  somewhat inquisitive and searching, and were purposely directed to"]]]
