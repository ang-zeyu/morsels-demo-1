(bridle or face  cover), being careful to place some buffalo hair over the nose and under  the chin, to guard against paining the horse, whose eyes remained  uncovered.    [Footnote 1: Long, S. H.; Exp. Rocky Mts., vol. 1, p. 291, Phila., 1822]    Trappings for the saddle (s[)i]n[']de-ehe[|c][)e]) were used. Some years  ago a specimen of Omaha trapping was presented by the writer to the  Anthropological Society of Washington, and subsequently was deposited in  the National Museum.      Traveling Gear.    Snow-shoes (se-hi^{n}be) were worn by the Omaha and Ponka when they  traversed a region, north of their modern, habitat.    For traveling on foot a staff (hi-mang[|c]e) was used when it was  necessary to pass over mountains; also when, heavy loads had to be  carried. This staff differed from the crutch (i-mang[|c]e).    The women had maca[k]a^n, or straps, for aiding them in carrying loads  of wood, etc.      Boats.    When they wished to cross streams they made hide boats, or mandeha.  These were manufactured from dried buffalo hides, which were sewed  together with sinew, and so tightly that no water could penetrate the  seams. Ten branches of red willow were placed within, the ends being  bent upward and fastened by withes to two other saplings, which extended  the whole length of the boat at the inside of the gunwale. The ten  pieces were the [t]ici-iki[p]ada^{n}. The rudder or steering oar  (i[|c]isa^{n}['][|c][)e]) was fashioned like the oars (mandu[|c]ugahi),  with the blade flat and of the breadth of two hands. The  rowers (u[|c]ugahi aka) sat near the bow, and the steersman  ([|c]isa^{n}['][|c]a aka) took his seat at the stern.      Musical Instruments.    Battles were of five kinds, [P]exe were generally gourds; wata^{n}[']  [p]exe, gourd rattles, were always round, and were partially filled with  seed, fine shot, or gravel, [T]ahanu[k]a [p]exe, green-hide rattles,  were of two sorts, one of which is \"[|c]iguje,\" bent a little. Specimens  of this form are in the National Museum.    Two kinds of rattles were called [t]a-cage, i.e., \"deers-claws,\" from  the composition of one variety, though the other was made of molars of  the elk.    [Illustration: Fig. 317--Skin drum.]    [Illustration: Fig. 318--Box drum.]    The Omaha used three styles of drums. The [|c]exe-ga[k]u b[|c]aska, or  flat drum, is illustrated by a specimen (no. 21675) in the National  Museum. The [|c]exe-ga[k]u gadaje is made of buffalo hide, cowhide, or  the skin of a horse. An example of this drum (no. 24682) is also in the  National Museum, and is illustrated by the accompanying figure 317. The  ja^{n}['] [|c]exe-ga[k]u, or [k]uge [|c]exe-ga[k]u, is a wooden or box  drum, represented by the accompanying figure 318, also from a specimen  (no. 58610) in the National Museum.    Whistles were made of elder (ba[t]uci-hi, or popgun wood) by pushing out  the pith. No holes were made in the sides of the tube.    Nisude [t]an[']ga, or large flutes, were made of red cedar. A branch was  cut off, rounded, split open with a knife, and hollowed out; then six  holes were made in the side of one of them, and the halves were  stuck together again. When one of these instruments is blown it  produces quavering notes. The best specimens were made by  [P]a[|c]i^{n}-[t]an[']ga, Big Pawnee.    The large flute is illustrated in figure 319.[1] Wahi nisude, or bone  flutes, were made of the long bones from the eagle wing. These small  flutes have only one hole. Reed flutes, [|c]iq[|c]e nisude, were made of  a kind of reed which grows south of the Omaha territory, probably in  Kansas. The Omaha obtained the reeds from some of the southern tribes  and made them into flutes having but one hole each.    [Footnote 1: Compare Ree fife, \"AMM 129-8429, Gray and Matthews,\" in the  National Museum.]    [Illustration: Fig. 319.--Omaha large flute.]          WEAPONS.      Clubs.    [Illustration: Fig. 320.--Omaha club (ja^{n}-[p]a[c]na).]    The ja^{n}-weti^{n}, \"striking-wood,\" is a four-sided club. It is made  of ash, and is as long as from the elbow to the tips of the fingers. The  ja^n-daona, \"wood with a smooth head,\" is a club made of ironwood, which  is very hard. According to the late Joseph La Fleche, the Omaha form of  this weapon had a steel point projecting from the ball.    [Illustration: Fig. 321.--Omaha club (ja^{n}-da[c]na).]    [Illustration: Fig. 322.--Omaha club (weaq[|c]ade).]    Figures 320 and 321 are forms of the ja^{n}-[p]a[c]na which may be seen  in the National Museum (nos. 2649 and 22419). The weaq[|c]ade, another  kind of war club, is made of some kind of hard wood. There are two  varieties, one of which is shown in figure 322 (National Museum no.  23729). The other has a ball carved at the end of a straight handle,  with a wooden point (of one piece with the ball and handle) projecting  from the ball, making an angle of about 130 deg. with one side of the  handle. There is a steel point inserted in the ball, forming an angle of  about 110 deg. with the other side of the handle. The i^{n}[']-wate-jin[']ga  is something like a slung shot. A round stone is wrapped in a piece of  hide which is fastened to a wooden handle about 2 feet long.      Tomahawks.    The heads of tomahawks as well as of battle-axes were at first made of  stone; but within the last century and a half they have been fashioned  of iron.      Spears.    Lances, darts, or spears are designated by the general term  man[']d[)e]hi. The ja^{n}[']-man'd[)e]hi are made of ash, and are from 6  to 8 feet long. There are two kinds, of one of which the handle is  round, and about an inch in diameter, and the point is flat and about  the width of three fingers at its juncture with the handle.    Besides these there are the lances, called waq[|c]exe-[|c]aze, of which  there are two varieties. One consists of a straight pole, which has been  thrust through a piece of buffalo hide that has its long end sewed  together, forming a sort of covering. To this hide are fastened feathers  of the crow and mi^{n}[']xa-sa^{n}, or swan, in alternate rows or  bunches. Between the feathers are fastened square pieces of blanket.  About the middle of the pole a space of nearly 6 inches is left without  feathers, and this is the place where the spear is grasped. When the  pole was not set into a metal point the lower end was cut very sharp.[1]  The other variety, or mand[)e]hi [|c]iguje, \"bent spear,\" is the weapon  which the Dakota call \"wahukeza.\" It is ornamented with eagle feathers  placed at intevals, one being at the end of the curved part; and it  generally terminates at the bottom in an iron point. It is possible for  one of these waq[|c]exe[|c]aze to reach a man about 6 feet distant; and  even mounted men have been killed by them. Spears are used also in some  of the dances. Around the shaft is wrapped the skin of a swan or brant.  The end feather at the top is white; the other feathers are white or  spotted. The bent spear is no longer employed by the Omaha, though the  Osage, Pawnee, and other tribes still use it to a greater or lesser  extent.      Bows.    [Illustration: Fig. 323.--Omaha bow (za^{n}zi-mand[)e]).]    [Illustration: Fig. 324.--Omaha bow ([t]a[k]a^{n}-mand[)e])]    Bows (man-d[)e]) are of two kinds. One is the man-d[)e] or  za^{n}zi-mand[)e] (bow-wood bow), having an unbroken curve past the grip  to within an inch or two of each nock.[2] The other kind is the  [t]a[k]a^{n}-mand[)e], so called because it has deer sinew glued on its  back.[3] Bows were made of hickory, ash, ironwood, or za^{n}zi, the last  being greatly preferred. It is a wood resembling that of the Osage  orange, with which some persons confound it; but it is black and much  harder than the former, the Osage orange wood being yellow, soft, and  easily cut. The za^{n}zi is probably that which Dougherty[4] called  \"bow-wood (<i>Maclura aurantiaca</i> of Nuttall).\"    [Footnote 1: See First Annual Report of Bureau of Ethnology, 1879-'80;  1881, Pl. X, \"Tolkotin cremation.\"]    [Footnote 2: This may be the \"self-bow\" mentioned in the American  Naturalist for July, 1886, p. 675.]    [Footnote 3: This is the sinew-backed bow above mentioned.]    [Footnote 4: Long's Expedition, op. cit., vol. I, p. 290.]    Bowstrings were made of the twisted sinew of the elk and buffalo, as  among other tribes.      Arrows.    [Illustration: Fig. 325.--Omaha hunting arrow.]    The arrows (ma^{n}) used in former days were of several kinds. The  hunting arrow, used for killing the buffalo, was generally about 2 feet  long, of the usual cylindric form, and armed with an elongate triangular  point, made at first of flint, afterward of sheet iron. The shoulders of  the arrow were rounded instead of angular, as in the ordinary barbed  form. The point, or head, was firmly secured to the shaft by deer sinew  wrapped around the neck of the point, and over that was spread some  cement, made in a manner to be afterward explained. The flight of the  arrow was equalized by three half-webs of feathers, neatly fastened near  its base in the usual manner.    Another kind of hunting arrow was the hide nazi[|c][)e], which was  altogether of wood. About 6 inches from the point the shaft was  triangular or quadrangular; and the point was made by holding the shaft  close to a fire and turning it round and round till the heat had reduced  it to the proper shape and had hardened it. This was used for killing  fish, deer, and small game.    [Illustration: Fig. 326.--Omaha war arrow.]    The war arrow (<i>b</i>) differed from that used in hunting in having a  barbed point, which was very slightly attached to the shaft, so that if  it penetrated the body of an enemy it could not be withdrawn without  leaving the point in the wound.    [Illustration: Fig. 327.--Omaha style of hide-[t]ace]    Children used the hide-[t]ace, or target arrow, when they began to learn  the use of the bow. With this a boy could kill small birds and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19921"],[0,"Prehistoric Textile Art of Eastern United States (#4)"],[1," are those who are rocked from side to side, as      in France. * * * The cradle is rocked by means of two ends of      canes, which make two rollers.[15]      SHIELDS.    Woven targets or shields would seem to be rather novel objects, but such  are mentioned by John Smith, who used those belonging to friendly  Indians in an encounter on the Chesapeake:        Here the Massawomek Targets stood vs in good stead, for vpon      Mosco's words we had set them about the forepart of our Boat      like a forecastle, from whence we securely beat the Salvages      from off the plaine without any hurt. * * * Arming ourselues      with these light Targets (which are made of little small      sticks woven betwixt strings of their hempe and silke grasse,      as is our cloth, but so firmly that no arrow can possibly      pierce them).[16]       [6] Hist. of Carolina, etc., John Lawson.

No class of articles of textile nature were more universally employed by  the aborigines than mats of split cane, rushes, and reeds, and our  information, derived from literature and from such remnants of the  articles themselves as have been recovered from graves and caves, is  quite full and satisfactory. Mats are not so varied in form and  character as are baskets, but their uses were greatly diversified; they  served for carpeting, seats, hangings, coverings, and wrappings, and  they were extensively employed in permanent house construction, and for  temporary or movable shelters. A few brief extracts will serve to  indicate their use in various classes of construction by the tribes  first encountered by the whites.    Hariot says that the houses of the Virginia Indians--        Are made of small poles made fast at the tops in rounde forme      after the maner as is vsed in many arbories in our gardens of      England, in most townes couered with barkes, and in some with      artificiall mattes made of long rushes; from the tops of the      houses downe to the ground.[17]    [Illustration: PL. I. PRODUCTS OF THE TEXTILE ART.    _a_, Openwork fish baskets of Virginia Indians; _b_, manner of weaving;  _c_, basket strainer; _d_, quiver of rushes; _e_, mat of rushes.]    It would appear from a study of the numerous illustrations of houses  given by this author that the mats so often referred to were identical  in construction with those still in use among the tribes of the upper  Mississippi and the far west. The rushes are laid close together side by  side and bound together at long intervals by cords intertwined across.  In _e_, plate I, is reproduced a small portion of a mat from Hariot's  engraving of the dead-house of the Virginia Indians, which shows this  method of construction.    The modern use of mats of this class in house construction is known by  an example which I have seen represented in a small photograph, taken  about the year 1868, and representing a Chippewa village, situated  somewhere in the upper Missouri valley, probably not far from Sioux  City, Iowa.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Use of mats in an Indian council (after  Lafitau).]    Mats were used not only in and about the dwellings of the aborigines,  but it was a common practice to carry them from place to place to sleep  on, or for use as seats or carpeting in meetings or councils of  ceremonious nature. The latter use is illustrated in a number of the  early accounts of the natives. Figure 2, copied from Lafitau, serves to  indicate the common practice.    The omnipresent sweat-house of the aborigines is thus described by  Smith:        Sometimes they are troubled with dropsies, swellings, aches,      and such like diseases; for cure whereof they build a Stone      in the forme of a Doue-house with mats, so close that a few      coales therein covered with a pot, will make the patient      sweat extreamely.[18]    Bartram, speaking of the Seminoles, states that the wide steps leading  up to the canopied platform of the council house are \"covered with  carpets or mats, curiously woven of split canes dyed of various  colours.\"[19]    The use of mats in the mound country in very early times is described by  Joutel as follows:        Their moveables are some bullocks' hides and goat skins well      cured, some mats close wove, wherewith they adorn their huts,      and some earthen vessels which they are very skilful at      making, and wherein they boil their flesh or roots, or      sagamise, which, as has been said, is their pottage. They      have also some small baskets made of canes, serving to put in      their fruit and other provisions. Their beds are made of      canes, raised 2 or 3 feet above the ground, handsomely fitted      with mats and bullocks' hides, or goat skins well cured,      which serve them for feather beds, or quilts and blankets;      and those beds are parted one from another by mats hung      up.[20]    The mats so much used for beds and carpets and for the covering of  shelters, houses, etc., were probably made of pliable materials such as  rushes. De la Potherie illustrates their use as beds,[21] one end of the  mat being rolled up for a pillow as shown in figure 3.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Use of mat in sleeping (after De la Potherie).]    The sizes of mats were greatly varied; the smallest were sufficient for  seating only a single person, but the largest were many yards in length,  the width being restricted to a few feet by the conditions of  construction.    Mats were woven in two or more styles. Where the strands or parts were  uniform in size and rigidity they were simply interlaced, but when one  strong or rigid series was to be kept in place by a pliable series, the  latter were twisted about the former at the intersections as in ordinary  twined weaving. The heavy series of strands or parts were held together  side by side by the intertwined strands placed far apart, a common  practice yet among native mat-makers. Much variety of character and  appearance was given to the fabric by varying the order of the strands  in intersection. It was a common practice to interweave strands of  different size, shape, or color, thus producing borders and patterns of  no little beauty. Du Pratz thus mentions the use of dyes by the  Louisiana Indians: \"The women sometimes add to this furniture of the bed  mats woven of cane, dyed of 3 colours, which colours in the weaving are  formed into various figures.\"[22] This is well illustrated in the mat  from a rock shelter in Tennessee, later to be described, and the Indians  of the east and north practiced the same art.    Speaking of the ceremony of smoking the calumet among the Iroquois, De  la Potherie says:        The ceremony is held in a large cabin in winter and in summer      in an open field. The place being chosen, it is surrounded      with branches to shade the company. In the center is spread a      large mat of canes dyed in various colors, which serves as a      carpet.[23]    Frequent mention is made of the use of mats in burial. Two brief  extracts will serve to illustrate this use. Butel-Dumont makes the  following statement regarding tribes of the lower Mississippi:        The Paskagoulas and Billoxis do not inter their chief when he      dies, but they dry the corpse with fire and smoke in such a      way that it becomes a mere skeleton. After it is reduced to      this state they carry it to the temple (for they have one as      well as the Natchez) and put it in the place of its      predecessor, which they take from the spot it occupied and      place it with the bodies of the other chiefs at the bottom of      the temple, where they are arranged one after the other,      standing upright like statues. As for the newly deceased, he      is exposed at the entrance of the temple on a sort of altar      or table made of cane and covered with a fine mat very neatly      worked in red and yellow squares with the skin of the      canes.[24]    Brackenridge[25] says that a few years ago, in the state of Tennessee,  \"Two human bodies were found in a copperas cave in a surprising state of  preservation. They were first wrapped up in a kind of blanket, supposed  to have been manufactured of the lint of nettles, afterwards with  dressed skins, and then a mat of nearly 60 yards in length.\"       [17] A Brief and True account of the New Found Land of     Virginia, Thomas Hariot, p. 24.
