Alfred readily obeyed;  and Louis, taking his book, began to show him what to do.    \"Louis, you must not tell him word for word,\" said Reginald:  \"Hamilton wouldn't like it--he never does himself.\"    \"But I may help him to do it for himself, may I not?\" said Louis.    \"Yes; but, Louis, you have not time--and he is so stupid,\"  replied Reginald; \"you won't have time to do your own.\"    But Louis thought he should have time for both, and, putting his arm  round Alfred, he kindly and patiently set him in the way of doing his  lesson properly, and then resumed his own disturbed studies.    Hardly, however, was he settled than he found himself listening to Frank,  who remarked, as Alfred left the room, \"We shall be sure to have 'Oars'  in soon!\"    \"Who do you mean by Oars?\" asked Louis.    \"Churchill,\" said Reginald, laughing.    \"What an extraordinary name!\" said Louis.    \"I say, Digby,\" cried a boy from the opposite side of the table,  \"they give you the credit of that cognomen--but we are all in the  dark as to its origin.\"    \"Like the origin of all truly great,\" answered Frank, \"it was very  simple: Churchill came one day to me with his usual 'Do tell us a bit,  that's a good fellow,' and after he had badgered me some minutes,  I asked him if he had not the smallest idea of his lesson--so, after  looking at it another minute, he begins thus, '_Omnes_, all.' 'Bravo!'  replied I. '_Conticuere_--What's that, Frank?' 'Were silent,' I answered:  'Go on.' After deep cogitation, and sundry hints, he discovered that  _tenebant_ must have some remote relationship to a verb signifying  to hold fast, and forthwith a bright thought strikes him, and on we go:  '_Intentique ora tenebant_--and intently they hold their oars,' he said,  exultingly. 'Very well,' quoth I, approvingly, and continued for him,  '_Inde toro pater_--the waters flowed glibly farther on, _ab alto_--to  the music of the spheres; the inseparable Castor and Pollux looking  down benignantly on their namesake below.' Here I was stopped by the  innocent youth's remark, that I certainly was quizzing, for he knew  that Castor and Pollux were the same in Latin as in English. Whereupon,  I demanded, with profound gravity, whether _gemini_ did not mean  twins, and if the twins were not Castor and Pollux--and if he knew  (who knew so much better than I) whether or no there might not be some  word in the Latin language, besides _gemini_, signifying twins; and  that if it was his opinion that I was quizzing, he had better do his  lesson himself. He looked hard, and, thinking I was offended, begged  pardon; and believing that _jubes_ was Castor and Pollux, we  got on quite famously--and he was quite reassured when we turned  from the descriptive to the historical, beginning with _Aeneas sic  orsus infandum_--Aeneas was such a horrid bear.\"    \"Didn't you tell him of his mistake?\" asked Louis, who could not  help laughing.    \"What! spoil the fun and the lesson I meant to give him?--not I.\"    \"Well, what then, Frank?\" said Reginald.    \"Why, imagine old Whitworth's surprise, when, confident in the free  translation of a first-class man, Oars flowed on as glibly as the  waters; Whitworth heard him to the end in his old dry way, and then  asked him where he got that farrago of nonsense;--I think he was  promoted to the society of dunces instanter, and learns either  Delectus or Eutropius now. Of course, he never applied again to me.\"    Louis did not express his opinion that Frank was ill-natured, though  he thought so, in spite of the hearty laugh with which his story was  greeted. When he turned again to his lesson, he found his book had  been abstracted.    \"I tell you what,\" cried Reginald, fiercely, \"I won't have Louis  tormented--who has taken his book? It's you, Ferrers, I am sure.\"    \"I! did you ever!\" replied that young gentleman. \"I appeal to you,  Digby--did you see me touch his book?\"    \"I did not, certainly,\" said Frank.    \"Give me the book,\" exclaimed Reginald, jumping upon the table, \"give  me the book, and let's have no more such foolery.\"    \"Get down, Mortimer, you're not transparent,\" cried several voices.    Reginald, however, paid no attention to the command, but pouncing upon  Ferrers at a vantage, threw him backwards off the form, tumbling over  his prostrate foe, and in his descent bringing down books, inkstand,  papers, and one of the candles, in glorious confusion.    \"What's the row!\" exclaimed Salisbury, adding an expression more  forcible than elegant; and, starting from his seat, he pulled Reginald  by main force from his adversary, with whom he was now struggling on  the floor, and at the same instant the remaining candle was extinguished.  Louis was almost stunned by the noise that ensued: some taking his  brother's part, and some that of Ferrers, while, in the dark, friend  struggled and quarrelled with friend as much as foe, no one attempting  to quell the tumult, until the door was suddenly burst open, and Hamilton  with Trevannion and two or three from the school-room entered. Hamilton  stood still for a moment, astonished by the unlooked-for obscurity. His  entrance checked the combatants, who at first imagined that one of their  masters had made his appearance, if that could be said to appear which  was hardly discernible in the dim light which came through the half-open  door. Hamilton begged one of the boys with him to fetch a light, and  taking advantage of the momentary lull, he called out, \"Is this Bedlam,  gentlemen? You ought to be ashamed of yourselves! What's the matter,  Mortimer?\"    \"Oh!\" replied Ferrers, \"they've been teasing his little brother,  and he can't abide it.\"    \"I only mean to say, that Louis shan't be plagued in this manner,\"  cried Reginald, passionately; \"and you know if the others were not  here you wouldn't dare to do it, you bully!\"    \"For shame, Mortimer,\" said Hamilton, decidedly; and coming up to  Reginald he drew him a little aside, not without a little resistance  on Reginald's part--\"What's the matter, Mortimer?\"    \"Matter! why that they are doing all they can to hinder Louis from  knowing his lessons to-morrow. I won't stand it. He has borne enough  of it, and patiently too.\"    \"But is that any reason you should forget that you are a gentleman?\"  said Hamilton.    \"My book is here, dear Reginald,\" said Louis, touching his brother's  shoulder.    Reginald darted a fierce glance at Ferrers, but not being able to  substantiate an accusation against him, remained silent, and, under  the eye of Hamilton and his friend Trevannion, the remainder of the  evening passed in a way more befitting the high places in the school  which the young gentlemen held; but Louis had been so much interrupted,  and was so much excited and unsettled by the noise and unwonted scenes,  that when Dr. Wilkinson came at nine to read prayers, he had hardly  prepared one of his lessons for the next day.          CHAPTER II.      Louis soon made himself a universal favorite among his school-fellows;  and, though he was pronounced by some to be a \"softy,\" and by  others honored by the equally comprehensive and euphonious titles  of \"spooney\" and \"muff,\" there were few who were not won by his gentle  good-nature, and the uniform good temper, and even playfulness, with  which he bore the immoderate quizzing that fell to his lot, as a new  boarder arrived in the middle of the half-year. If there were an errand  to be run among the seniors, it was, \"Louis Mortimer, will you get me  this or that?\" if a dunce wanted helping, Louis was sure to be applied  to, with the certainty in both cases that the requests would be complied  with, though they might, as was too often the case, interfere with his  duties; but Louis had not courage to say _no_.    In proportion, however, as our hero grew in the good graces of his  school-fellows, he fell out of those of his masters, for lessons were  brought only half-learned, and exercises only half-written, or blotted  and scrawled so as to be nearly unintelligible; and after he had been  a fortnight at school, he seemed much more likely to descend to a lower  class than to mount a step in his own. Day after day saw Louis kept in  the school-room during play-hours, to learn lessons which ought to have  been done the night before, or to write out some long imposition as a  punishment for some neglected "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19856"],[0,"A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola (#4)"],[1,"II. Old Mashongnavi, plan.]    In preparing this paper for publication Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff has  rendered much assistance in the revision of manuscript, and in the  preparation of some of the final drawings of ground plans; on him has  also fallen the compilation and arrangement of Mr. A. M. Stephen's  traditionary material from Tusayan, embraced in the first chapter of the  paper.    This latter material is of special interest in a study of the pueblos as  indicating some of the conditions under which this architectural type  was developed, and it appropriately introduces the more purely  architectural study by the author.    Such traditions must be used as history with the utmost caution,  and only for events that are very recent. Time relations are often  hopelessly confused and the narratives are greatly incumbered with  mythologic details. But while so barren in definite information, these  traditions are of the greatest value, often through their merely  incidental allusions, in presenting to our minds a picture of the  conditions under which the repeated migrations of the pueblo builders  took place.    The development of architecture among the Pueblo Indians was  comparatively rapid and is largely attributable to frequent changes,  migrations, and movements of the people as described in Mr. Stephen's  account. These changes were due to a variety of causes, such as disease,  death, the frequent warfare carried on between different tribes and  branches of the builders, and the hostility of outside tribes; but a  most potent factor was certainly the inhospitable character of their  environment. The disappearance of some venerated spring during an  unusually dry season would be taken as a sign of the disfavor of the  gods, and, in spite of the massive character of the buildings, would  lead to the migration of the people to a more favorable spot. The  traditions of the Zuñis, as well as those of the Tusayan, frequently  refer to such migrations. At times tribes split up and separate, and  again phratries or distant groups meet and band together. It is  remarkable that the substantial character of the architecture should  persist through such long series of compulsory removals, but while the  builders were held together by the necessity for defense against their  wilder neighbors or against each other, this strong defensive motive  would perpetuate the laborious type of construction. Such conditions  would contribute to the rapid development of the building art.          CHAPTER I.    TRADITIONAL HISTORY OF TUSAYAN.      EXPLANATORY.    In this chapter[1] is presented a summary of the traditions of the  Tusayan, a number of which were collected from old men, from Walpi on  the east to Moen-kopi on the west. A tradition varies much with the  tribe and the individual; an authoritative statement of the current  tradition on any point could be made only with a complete knowledge of  all traditions extant. Such knowledge is not possessed by any one man,  and the material included in this chapter is presented simply as a  summary of the traditions secured.        [Footnote 1: This chapter is compiled by Cosmos Mindeleff from      material collected by A. M. Stephen.]    The material was collected by Mr. A. M. Stephen, of Keam's Canyon,  Arizona, who has enjoyed unusual facilities for the work, having lived  for a number of years past in Tusayan and possessed the confidence  of the principal priests--a very necessary condition in work of  this character. Though far from complete, this summary is a more  comprehensive presentation of the traditionary history of these people  than has heretofore been published.      SUMMARY OF TRADITIONS.    The creation myths of the Tusayan differ widely, but none of them  designate the region now occupied as the place of their genesis. These  people are socially divided into family groups called wi´ngwu, the  descendants of sisters, and groups of wi´ngwu tracing descent from the  same female ancestor, and having a common totem called my´umu. Each of  these totemic groups preserves a creation myth, carrying in its details  special reference to themselves; but all of them claim a common origin  in the interior of the earth, although the place of emergence to the  surface is set in widely separated localities. They all agree in  maintaining this to be the fourth plane on which mankind has existed. In  the beginning all men lived together in the lowest depths, in a region  of darkness and moisture; their bodies were misshaped and horrible, and  they suffered great misery, moaning and bewailing continually. Through  the intervention of Myúingwa (a vague conception known as the god of the  interior) and of Baholikonga (a crested serpent of enormous size, the  genius of water), the \"old men\" obtained a seed from which sprang a  magic growth of cane. It penetrated through a crevice in the roof  overhead and mankind climbed to a higher plane. A dim light appeared in  this stage and vegetation was produced. Another magic growth of cane  afforded the means of rising to a still higher plane on which the light  was brighter; vegetation was reproduced and the animal kingdom was  created. The final ascent to this present, or fourth plane, was effected  by similar magic growths and was led by mythic twins, according to some  of the myths, by climbing a great pine tree, in others by climbing the  cane, _Phragmites communis_, the alternate leaves of which afforded  steps as of a ladder, and in still others it is said to have been a  rush, through the interior of which the people passed up to the surface.  The twins sang as they pulled the people out, and when their song was  ended no more were allowed to come; and hence, many more were left below  than were permitted to come above; but the outlet through which mankind  came has never been closed, and Myu´ingwa sends through it the germs of  all living things. It is still symbolized by the peculiar construction  of the hatchway of the kiva and in the designs on the sand altars in  these underground chambers, by the unconnected circle painted on pottery  and by devices on basketry and other textile fabrics.      [Illustration: Plate III. General view of Awatubi.]    All the people that were permitted to come to the surface were collected  and the different families of men were arranged together. This was done  under the direction of twins, who are called Pekónghoya, the younger one  being distinguished by the term Balíngahoya, the Echo. They were  assisted by their grandmother, Kóhkyang wúhti, the Spider woman, and  these appear in varying guises in many of the myths and legends. They  instructed the people in divers modes of life to dwell on mountain or on  plain, to build lodges, or huts, or windbreaks. They distributed  appropriate gifts among them and assigned each a pathway, and so the  various families of mankind were dispersed over the earth's surface.    The Hopituh,[2] after being taught to build stone houses, were also  divided, and the different divisions took separate paths. The legends  indicate a long period of extensive migrations in separate communities;  the groups came to Tusayan at different times and from different  directions, but the people of all the villages concur in designating the  Snake people as the first occupants of the region. The eldest member of  that nyumu tells a curious legend of their migration from which the  following is quoted:      At the general dispersal my people lived in snake skins, each family    occupying a separate snake skin bag, and all were hung on the end of    a rainbow, which swung around until the end touched Navajo Mountain,    where the bags dropped from it; and wherever a bag dropped, there    was their house. After they arranged their bags they came out from    them as men and women, and they then, built a stone house which had    five sides. [The story here relates the adventures of a mythic Snake    Youth, who brought back a strange woman who gave birth to    rattlesnakes; these bit the people and compelled them to migrate.] A    brilliant star arose in the southeast, which would shine for a while    and then disappear. The old men said, \"Beneath that star there must    be people,\" so they determined to travel toward it. They cut a staff    and set it in the ground and watched till the star reached its top,    then they started and traveled as long as the star shone; when it    disappeared they halted. But the star did not shine every night, for    sometimes many years elapsed before it appeared again. When this    occurred, our people built houses during their halt; they built both    round and square houses, and all the ruins between here and Navajo    Mountain mark the places where our people lived. They waited till    the star came to the top of the staff again, then they moved on, but    many people were left in those houses and they followed afterward at    various times. When our people reached Wipho (a spring a few miles    north from Walpi) the star disappeared and has never been seen    since. They built a house there and after a time Másauwu (the god of    the face of the earth) came and compelled them to move farther down    the valley, to a point about half way between the East and Middle    Mesa, and there they stayed many plantings. One time the old men    were assembled and Másauwu came among them, looking like a horrible    skeleton, and his bones rattling dreadfully. He menaced them with    awful gestures, and lifted off his fleshless head and thrust it into    their faces; but he could not frighten them. So he said, \"I have    lost my wager; all that I have is yours; ask for anything you want    and I will give it to you.\" At that time our people's house was    beside the water course, and Másauwu said, \"Why are you sitting here    in the mud? Go up yonder where it is dry.\" So they went across to    the low, sandy terrace on the west side of the mesa, near the"]]]
