Then, though a few varieties may  have since given out and some imported ones run wild, the undomesticated  plants and trees were much as now. Not so the cultivated kinds. The  Indians were wretched husbandmen, nor had the Mound-builders at all the  diversity of agricultural products so familiar to us. Tobacco, Indian  corn, cocoa, sweet potatoes, potatoes, the custard apple, the Jerusalem  artichoke, the guava, the pumpkin and squash, the papaw and the  pineapple, indigenous to North America, had been under cultivation here  before Columbus came, the first four from most ancient times. The manioc  or tapioca-plant, the red-pepper plant, the marmalade plum, and the  tomato were raised in South America before 1500.  The persimmon, the  cinchona tree, millet, the Virginia and the Chili strawberry are natives  of this continent, but have been brought under cultivation only within  the last three centuries.    The four great cereals, wheat, rye, oats, and rice, constituting all our  main food crops but corn, have come to us from Europe. So have cherries,  quinces, and pears, also hops, currants, chestnuts, and mushrooms. The  banana, regarded by von Humboldt as an original American fruit, modern  botanists derive from Asia. With reference to apples there may be some  question. Apples of a certain kind flourished in New England so early  after the landing of the Pilgrims that it is difficult to suppose the  fruit not to have been indigenous to this continent.   Champlain, in  1605 or 1606, found the Indians about the present sites of Portland,  Boston, and Plymouth in considerable agricultural prosperity, with  fields of corn and tobacco, gardens rich in melons, squashes, pumpkins,  and beans, the culture of none of which had they apparently learned from  white men. Mr. Payne's generalization, that superior food-supply  occasioned the Old World's primacy in civilization, and also that of the  Mexicans and Peruvians here, seems too sweeping, yet it evidently  contains large truth.        PART FIRST    THE FORE-HISTORY    PERIOD I.    DISCOVERY AND SETTLEMENT    1492-1660    CHAPTER I.    COLUMBUS    [1000]    There is no end to the accounts of alleged discoveries of America before  Columbus. Most of these are fables. It is, indeed, nearly certain that  hardy Basque, Breton, and Norman fishermen, adventuring first far north,  then west, had sighted Greenland and Labrador and become well acquainted  with the rich fishing-grounds about Newfoundland and the Saint Lawrence  Gulf. Many early charts of these regions, without dates and hitherto  referred to Portuguese navigators of a time so late as 1500, are now  thought to be the work of these earlier voyagers. They found the New  World, but considered it a part of the Old.    Important, too, is the story of supposed Norse sea-rovers hither,  derived from certain Icelandic manuscripts of the fourteenth century. It  is a pleasing narrative, that of Lief Ericson's sail in 1000-1001 to  Helluland, Markland, and at last to Vineland, and of the subsequent  tours by Thorwald Ericson in 1002, Thorfinn Karlsefne, 1007-1009, and of  Helge and Finnborge in 1011, to points still farther away. Such voyages  probably occurred. As is well known, Helluland has been interpreted to  be Newfoundland; Markland, Nova Scotia; and Vineland, the country  bordering Mount Hope Bay in Bristol, R. I. These identifications are  possibly correct, and even if they are mistaken, Vineland may still have  been somewhere upon the coast of what is now the United States.    In the present condition of the evidence, however, we have to doubt  this. No scholar longer believes that the writing on Dighton Rock is  Norse, or that the celebrated Skeleton in Armor found at Fall River was  a Northman's, or that the old Stone Mill at Newport was constructed by  men from Iceland. Even if the manuscripts, composed between three and  four hundred years after the events which they are alleged to narrate,  are genuine, and if the statements contained in them are true, the  latter are far too indefinite to let us be sure that they are applicable  to United States localities.    [Illustration: Dighton Rock]    [l260]    But were we to go so far as to admit that the Northmen came here and  began the settlements ascribed to them, they certainly neither  appreciated nor published their exploits. Their colony, wherever it was,  endured but for a day, and it, with its locality, speedily passed from  knowledge in Scandinavia itself. America had not yet, in effect, been  discovered.    [Illustration: The Old Stone Mill at Newport, R. I.]    [1300]    We must remember that long anterior to Columbus's day unbiassed and  thoughtful men had come to believe the earth to be round. They also knew  that Europe constituted but a small part of it. In the year 1260 the  Venetian brothers Niccolo and Maffeo Polo made their way to China, the  first men from Western Europe ever to travel so far. They returned in  1269, but in 1271 set out again, accompanied by Niccolo's son, a youth  of seventeen. This son was the famous Marco Polo, whose work, \"The  Wonders of the World,\" reciting his extended journeys through China and  the extreme east and southeast of Asia, and his eventful voyage home by  sea, ending in 1295, has come down to our time, one of the most  interesting volumes in the world. Friar Orderic's eastern travels in  1322-1330, as appropriated by Sir John Mandeville, were published before  1371.    Columbus knew these writings, and the reading and re-reading of them had  made him an enthusiast. In Polo's book he had learned of Mangi and Far  Cathay, with their thousands of gorgeous cities, the meanest finer than  any then in Europe; of their abounding mines pouring forth infinite  wealth, their noble rivers, happy populations, curious arts, and benign  government. Polo had told him of Cambalu (Peking), winter residence of  the Great Khan, Kublai--Cambalu with its palaces of marble,  golden-roofed, its guard of ten thousand soldiers, its imperial stables  containing five thousand elephants, its unnumbered army, navy, and  merchant marine; of oxen huge as elephants; of richest spices, nuts  large as melons, canes fifteen yards long, silks, cambrics, and the  choicest furs; and of magic Cipango (Japan), island of pearls, whose  streets were paved with gold.    [Illustration: Globus Martini Behaim Narinbergensis 1492.]    [1456]    Columbus believed all this, and it cooperated with his intense and even  bigoted religious faith to kindle in him an all-consuming ambition to  reach this distant Eden by sea, that he might carry the Gospel to those  opulent heathen and partake their unbounded temporal riches in return.  Poor specimen of a saint as Columbus is now known to have been, he  believed himself divinely called to this grand enterprise.    Christopher Columbus, or Christobal Colon, as he always signed himself  after he entered the service of Spain, was born in Genoa about 1456.  Little is certainly known of his early life. His father was a humble  wool-carder. The youth possessed but a sorry education, spite of his few  months at the University of Pavia. At the age of fourteen he became a  sailor, knocking about the world in the roughest manner, half the time  practically a pirate. In an all-day's sea fight, once, his ship took  fire and he had to leap overboard; but being a strong swimmer he swam,  aided by an oar, eight leagues to land.    [1470]    From 1470 to 1484 we find him in Portugal, the country most interested  and engaged then in ocean-going and discovery. Here he must have known  Martin Behem, author of the famous globe, finished in 1492, whereon Asia  is exhibited as reaching far into the same hemisphere with Europe.  Prince Henry of Portugal earnestly patronized all schemes for  exploration and discovery, and the daughter, Philippa, of one of his  captains, Perestrello, Columbus married. With her he lived at Porto  Santo in the Madeiras, where he became familiar with Correo, her  sister's husband, also a distinguished navigator. The islanders fully  believed in the existence of lands in the western Atlantic. West winds  had brought to them strange woods curiously carved, huge cane-brakes  like those of India described by Ptolemy, peculiarly fashioned canoes,  and corpses with skin of a hue unknown to Europe or Africa.    [Illustration: Prince Henry of Portugal--\"The Navigator.\" From an old  print.]    [1475-1484]    Reflecting on these things, studying Perestrello's and Correo's charts  and accounts of their voyages, corresponding with Toscanelli and other  savans, himself an adept in drawing maps and sea-charts, for a time his  occupation in Lisbon, cruising here and there, once far northward to  Iceland, and talking with navigators from every Atlantic port, Columbus  became acquainted with the best geographical science of his time.    This had convinced him that India could be reached by sailing westward.  The theoretical possibility of so doing was of course admitted by all  who held the earth to be a sphere, but most regarded it practically  impossible, in the then condition of navigation, to sail the necessary  distance. Columbus considered the earth far smaller than was usually  thought, a belief which we find hinted at so early as 1447, upon the  famous mappe-Monde of the Pitti Palace in Florence, whereon Europe  appears projected far round to the northwest. Columbus seems to have  viewed this extension as a sort of yoke joining India to Scandinavia by  the north. He judged that Asia, or at least Cipango, stretched  two-thirds of the way to Europe, India being twice as near westward as  eastward. Thirty or forty days he deemed sufficient for making it.  Toscanelli and Behem as well as he held this belief; he dared boldly to  act upon it.    [Illustration: Queen Isabella of Spain.]    But to do so required resources.

[Sidenote: Object of the book.]    1. In publishing this work, my chief object is to remove the general and  erroneous impression from the minds of European and Christian writers  regarding Islam, that Mohammad waged wars of conquest, extirpation, as  well as of proselytizing against the Koreish, other Arab tribes, the  Jews, and Christians;[1] that he held the Koran in one hand and the  scimitar in the other, and compelled people to believe in his mission. I  have endeavoured in this book, I believe on sufficient grounds, to show  that neither the wars of Mohammad were offensive, nor did he in any way  use force or compulsion in the matter of belief.    [Footnote 1: \"He now occupied a position where he might become the agent  for executing the divine sentence, and at the same time triumphantly  impose the true religion on those who had rejected it.\" The Life of  Mahomet, by Sir W. Muir, page 211. London, 1877. (New Edition.)    \"The free toleration of the purer among the creeds around him, which the  Prophet had at first enjoined, gradually changes into intolerance.  Persecuted no longer, Mohammad becomes a persecutor himself; with the  Koran in one hand, and scymitar in the other, he goes forth to offer to  the nations the three-fold alternative of conversion, tribute,  death.\"--Mohammed and Mohammedanism, by Mr. R. Bosworth Smith, page 137.  Second Edition.]      [Sidenote: Early wrongs of the Moslems.]    [Sidenote: Justification in taking up arms, if taken.]    2. All the wars of Mohammad were defensive. He and those who took  interest in his cause were severely oppressed at intervals, and were in  a sort of general persecution at Mecca at the hands of the ungodly and  fierce Koreish. Those who were weak and without protection had to leave  their city, and twice fly to the Christian land of Abyssinia, pursued by  the wrathful Koreish, but in vain. Those who remained at Mecca were  subject to all sorts of indignities, malignity and a deprivation of all  religious and social liberty, because they had forsaken the inferior  deities of the Koreish, and believed in the only ONE GOD of Mohammad, in  whose mission they had full belief. Mohammad and his followers had every  sanction, under the natural and international law, then and there to  wage war against their persecutors with the object of removing the  (_fitnah_) persecution and obtaining their civil rights of freedom and  religious liberty in their native city.      [Sidenote: Commencement of the state of war.]    [Sidenote: The Koreish being public enemies were liable to be  treated as such.]    3. The fierce persecutions renewed by the Koreish at the time of the  expulsion of the Moslems from Mecca were acts of hostility tantamount to  a declaration of war. From that time commenced the state of war between  the parties. In the Arab society at Mecca there was neither an organized  Government, nor any distinction between a public and private person and  property. There was no regular army in the State, and what existed was  not a permanently organized body, so provided with external marks that  it could be readily identified. The form of Government at Mecca was  patriarchal, and the chiefs of the Koreish and the citizens of Medina  themselves constituted an army when occasion arose. Therefore, since the  commencement of hostilities or the state of war, every individual of the  Koreish or the Meccans was a public enemy of the Moslems, and liable to  be treated as such in his person and property, except those who were  unable to take part in the hostilities, or, as a matter of fact,  abstained from engaging in them. Therefore it was lawful for the Moslems  to threaten or to waylay the caravans of the enemy, which passed to and  from Mecca close to Medina, and also to attack the Koreish at Mecca, if  they could possibly do so.      [Sidenote: But the Moslems could not take up arms to redress their  wrongs under certain circumstances.]    4. But as the people amongst whom the Prophet and his fugitive Moslems  now sojourned had only pledged to defend them at Medina, the flying  Mohammadans could not take up arms against their aggressors, the  Koreish, to defend their rights of religious liberty and citizenship,  much less of taking arms to compel the non-believers to believe in  Moslem faith, and so they preferred to live in peace at Medina, and  enjoy the blessings of their new religion without any disturbance from  without, if possible.      [Sidenote: Moslems otherwise engaged at Medina had no intention of  suffering the horrors of war by taking the initiative.]    [Sidenote: But were in imminent danger from the enemy.]    5. In fact, the Moslems, after suffering so long such heavy persecutions  at Mecca, had at length got an asylum of peace at Medina, where they had  very little desire left to entertain any idea of commencing hostilities  or undergoing once more the horrors of war, and were too glad to live in  peace after their last escape. The people of Medina had only agreed to  defend the Prophet from attack, not to join him in any aggressive steps  towards the Koreish. The attention of Mohammad and his followers who had  fled with him was mainly occupied in preaching and teaching the tenets  of Islam, in establishing a fraternity between the refugees and the  citizens, in building a house for prayer, in providing houses for  refugees, in contracting treaties of neutrality with the Jews of Medina  and other surrounding tribes, Bani Zamra (a tribe connected with Mecca)  and also with Bani Mudlij (a tribe of Kinana related to the Koreish), in  anticipation of the impending danger[2] from the Koreish, who had  pursued them on the similar occasions before, and in organizing, above  all these, some of the religious and civil institutions for the  Moslems, who were now fast assuming the position of an independent  society or commonwealth. Under such circumstances, it was next to  impossible for Mohammad or his adherents to think of anything like an  offensive war with their inveterate foes, or to take up arms for  proselytizing purposes.    [Footnote 2: See Sura XXIV, verse 54.]      [Sidenote: The Koreish first attacked the Moslems at Medina. They could  not forbear the escape of the Moslems.]    6. The Koreish, seeing the persecuted had left almost all their native  lands for a distant city out of their approach, except by a military  expedition, and losing Mohammad, for whose arrest they had tried their  utmost, as well as upon hearing the reception, treatment, religious  freedom and brotherly help the Moslems received and enjoyed at Medina,  could not subdue their ferocious animosity against the exiles. The  hostility of the Koreish had already been aroused. The severity and  injustice of the Koreish was so great, that when, in 615 A.D., a party  of 11 Moslems had emigrated to Abyssinia, they had pursued them to  overtake them. And again, in 616 A.D., when the persecution by the  Koreish was hotter than before, a party of about 100 Moslems had fled  from Mecca to Abyssinia, the Koreish sent an embassy to Abyssinia to  obtain the surrender of the emigrants. There is every reason to believe  that the Koreish, enraged as they were on the escape of the Moslems in  their third and great emigration in 622 A.D., would naturally have  taken every strong and hostile measure to persecute the fugitives.[3]    It was in the second year from the general expulsion of the Moslems from  Mecca that the Koreish, with a large army of one thousand strong,  marched upon the Moslems at Medina. Medina being 250 miles or 12 stages  from Mecca, the aggressive army, after marching 8 stages, arrived at  Badr, which is 3 or 4 stages from Medina. Mahommad--with only 300  Moslems, more being from among the people of Medina than the  refugees--came out of Medina in self-defence to encounter the Koreish,  and the famous battle of Badr was fought only at thirty miles from  Medina. There could be no doubt that the affair was purely and  admittedly a defensive one.    Sura XXII, verses 39-42, copied at page 17 of this book, was first  published in the matter of taking up arms in self-defence after the  battle of Badr.    [Footnote 3: The idea of forbearance on the part of the Koreish, as  entertained by Sir W. Muir, is not borne out by their former conduct of  persecuting the believers and pursuing the fugitives among them. He  says: \"Mahomet and Abu Bakr trusted their respective clans to"]]]
