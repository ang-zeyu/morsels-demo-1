[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18206"],[0,"Navaho Houses (#4)"],[1," is practically uninhabited. He may, perhaps,  meet half a dozen Indians in a day, or he may meet none, and at sunset  when he camps he will probably hear the bark of a dog in the distance,  or he may notice on the mountain side a pillar of smoke like that  arising from his own camp fire. This is all that he will see to indicate  the existence of other life than his own, yet the tribe numbers over  12,000 souls, and it is probable that there was no time during the day  when there were not several pairs of eyes looking at him, and were he  to fire his gun the report would probably be heard by several hundred  persons. Probably this custom of half-concealed habitations is a  survival from the time when the Navaho were warriors and plunderers,  and lived in momentary expectation of reprisals on the part of their  victims.    Although the average Navaho family may be said to be in almost constant  movement, they are not at all nomads, yet the term has frequently been  applied to them. Each family moves back and forth within a certain  circumscribed area, and the smallness of this area is one of the most  remarkable things in Navaho life.    Ninety per cent of the Navaho one meets on the reservation are mounted  and usually riding at a gallop, apparently bent on some important  business at a far-distant point. But a closer acquaintance will develop  the fact that there are many grown men in the tribe who are entirely  ignorant of the country 30 or 40 miles from where they were born. It  is an exceptional Navaho who knows the country well 60 miles about his  birthplace, or the place where he may be living, usually the same thing.  It is doubtful whether there are more than a few dozens of Navaho living  west of the mountains who know anything of the country to the east, and  vice versa. This ignorance of what we may term the immediate vicinity of  a place is experienced by every traveler who has occasion to make a  long journey over the reservation and employs a guide. But he discovers  it only by personal experience, for the guide will seldom admit his  ignorance and travels on, depending on meeting other Indians living  in that vicinity who will give him the required local knowledge. This  peculiar trait illustrates the extremely restricted area within which  each \"nomad\" family lives.    Now and then one may meet a family moving, for such movements are quite  common. Usually each family has at least two locations--not definite  places, but regions--and they move from one to the other as the  necessity arises. In such cases they take everything with them,  including flocks of sheep and goats and herds of ponies and cattle, if  they possess any. The _qasci[ng]_, as the head of the family is called,  drives the ponies and cattle, the former a degenerate lot of little  beasts not much larger than an ass, but capable of carrying a man in  an emergency 100 miles in a day. He carries his arms, for the coyotes  trouble the sheep at night, two or three blankets, and a buckskin on  his saddle, but nothing more. It is his special duty to keep the ponies  moving and in the trail. Following him comes a flock of sheep and goats,  bleating and nibbling at the bushes and grass as they slowly trot along,  urged by the dust-begrimed squaw and her children. Several of the more  tractable ponies carry packs of household effects stuffed into buckskin  and cotton bags or wrapped in blankets, a little corn for food, the rude  blanket loom of the woman, baskets, and wicker bottles, and perhaps a  scion of the house, too young to walk, perched on top of all. Such a  caravan is always accompanied by several dogs--curs of unknown breed,  but invaluable aids to the women and children in herding the flocks.    Under the Navaho system descent is in the female line. The children  belong to the mother, and likewise practically all property except  horses and cattle. Sheep and goats belong exclusively to her, and the  head of the family can not sell a sheep to a passing traveler without  first obtaining the consent and approval of his wife. Hence in such a  movement as that sketched above the flocks are looked after by the  women, while under normal circumstances, when the family has settled  down and is at home, the care of the flocks devolves almost entirely on  the little children, so young sometimes that they can just toddle about.    The waters are usually regarded by the Navaho as the common property  of the tribe, but the cultivable lands in the vicinity are held by the  individuals and families as exclusively their own. Their flocks occupy  all the surrounding pasture, so that virtually many of the springs come  to be regarded as the property of the people who plant nearest to them.    In early times, when the organization of the people into clans was more  clearly defined, a section of territory was parceled out and held as a  clan ground, and some of the existing clans took their names from such  localities. Legends are still current among the old men of these early  days before the introduction of sheep and goats and horses by the  Spaniards, when the people lived by the chase and on wild fruits, grass  seeds, and pinon nuts, and such supplies as they could plunder from  their neighbors. Indian corn or maize was apparently known from the  earliest time, but so long as plunder and the supply of game continued  sufficient, little effort was made to grow it. Later as the tribe  increased and game became scarcer, the cultivation of corn increased,  but until ten years ago more grain was obtained in trade from the  Pueblos than was grown in the Navaho country. There are now no defined  boundaries to the ancient clan lands, but they are still recognized  in a general way and such a tract is spoken of as \"my mother's land.\"    Families cling to certain localities and sections not far apart, and  when compelled, by reason of failure of springs or too close cropping  of the grass, to go to other neighborhoods, they do not move to the new  place as a matter of right, but of courtesy; and the movement is never  undertaken until satisfactory arrangements have been concluded with the  families already living there.    Some of the Pueblo tribes, the Hopi or Moki, for example, have been  subjected to much the same conditions as the Navaho; but in this case  similarity of conditions has produced very dissimilar results, that is,  as regards house structures. The reasons, however, are obvious, and  lie principally in two distinct causes--antecedent habits and personal  character. The Navaho are a fine, athletic race of men, living a free  and independent life. They are without chiefs, in the ordinary meaning  of the term, although there are men in the tribe who occupy prominent  positions and exercise a kind of semiauthority--chiefs by courtesy, as  it were. Ever since we have known them, now some three hundred years,  they have been hunters, warriors, and robbers. When hunting, war,  and robbery ceased to supply them with the necessaries of life they  naturally became a pastoral people, for the flocks and the pasture lands  were already at hand. It is only within the last few years that they  have shown indication of developing into an agricultural people. With  their previous habits only temporary habitations were possible, and when  they became a pastoral people the same habitations served their purpose  better than any other. The hogans of ten or fifteen years ago, and  to a certain extent the hogans of today, are practically the same as  they were three hundred years ago. There has been no reason for a change  and consequently no change has been made.    On the other hand, the Hopi came into the country with a comparatively  elaborate system of house structures, previously developed elsewhere.  They are an undersized, puny race, content with what they have and  asking only to be left alone. They are in no sense warriors, although  there is no doubt that they have fought bitterly among themselves within  historic times. Following the Spanish invasion they also received sheep  and goats, but their previous habits prevented them from becoming a  pastoral people like the Navaho, and their main reliance for food is,  and always was, on horticultural products. Living, as they did, in fixed  habitations and in communities, the pastoral life was impossible to  them, and their marked timidity would prevent the abandonment of their  communal villages.    Under modern conditions these two methods of life, strongly opposed to  each other, although practiced in the same region and under the same  physical conditions, are drawing a little closer together. Under the  strong protecting arm of the Government the Hopi are losing a little  of their timidity and are gradually abandoning their villages on the  mesa summits and building individual houses in the valleys below.  Incidentally they are increasing their flocks and herds. On the other  hand, under the stress of modern conditions, the Navaho are surely,  although very slowly, turning to agriculture, and apparently show some  disposition to form small communities. Their flocks of sheep and goats  have decreased materially in the last few years, a decrease due largely  to the removal of the duty on wool and the consequent low price they  obtained from the traders for this staple article of their trade.    In both cases the result, so far as the house structures are concerned,  is the same. The houses of the people, the homes \"we have always had,\"  as they put it, are rapidly disappearing, and the examples left today  are more or less influenced by ideas derived from the whites. Among the  Navaho such contact has been very slight, but it has been sufficient to  introduce new methods of construction and in fact new structures, and it  is doubtful whether the process and the ritual later described could be  found in their entirety today. Many of the modern houses of the Navaho  in the mountainous and timbered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18222"],[0,"The Religion of Numa (#4)"],[1,"must always have been the sword or  its equivalent, and along with Flora and Ceres there must always have  been a god of strife and battle. That Mars was this god in early as well  as later times is shown above all things by the fact that he was always  worshipped outside the city, as a god who must be kept at a distance.  Naturally his cult was associated with the dominant interest of life,  the crops, and he was worshipped in the beautiful ceremony of the  purification of the fields, which Mr. Walter Pater has so exquisitely  described at the opening of _Marius the Epicurean_. But he was regarded  as the protector of the fields and the warder off of evil influences  rather than as a positive factor in the development of the crops. Then  too in the early days of the Roman militia, before the regular army had  come into existence, the war season was only during the summer after the  planting and before the harvest, so that the two festivals which marked  the beginning and the end of that season were also readily associated  with the state of the crops at that time.    But the most interesting and curious thing about this old religion is  not so much what it does contain as what it does not. It is not so much  what we find as what we miss, for more than half the gods whom we  instinctively associate with Rome were not there under this old regime.  Here is a partial list of those whose names we do not find: Minerva,  Diana, Venus, Fortuna, Hercules, Castor, Pollux, Apollo, Mercury, Dis,  Proserpina, Aesculapius, the Magna Mater. And yet their absence is not  surprising when we realise that almost all of the gods in this list  represent phases of life with which Rome in this early period was  absolutely unacquainted. She had no appreciable trade or commerce, no  manufactures or particular handicrafts, and no political interests  except the simple patriarchal government which sufficed for her present  needs. Her gods of water were the gods of rivers and springs; Neptune  was there, but he was not the ocean-god like the Greek Poseidon. Vulcan,  the god of fire, who was afterwards associated with the Greek Hephaistos  and became the patron of metal-working, was at this time merely the god  of destructive and not of constructive fire. Even the great god Juppiter  who was destined to become almost identical with the name and fame of  Rome was not yet a god of the state and politics, but merely the  sky-god, especially the lightning god, Juppiter Feretrius, the  \"striker,\" who had a little shrine on the Capitoline where later the  great Capitoline temple of Juppiter Optimus Maximus was to stand.  Another curious characteristic of this early age, which, I think, has  never been commented on, is the extraordinarily limited number of  goddesses. Vesta is the only one who seems to stand by herself without a  male parallel. Each of the others is merely the contrasted potentiality  in a pair of which the male is much more famous, and the only ones in  these pairs who ever obtained a pronounced individuality did so because  their cult was afterwards reinforced by being associated with some  extra-Roman cult. The best illustration of this last is Juno. We may go  further and say that it-seems highly probable that the worship of female  deities was in the main confined to the women of the community, while  the men worshipped the gods. This distinction extended even to the  priesthoods where the wife of the priest of a god was the priestess of  the corresponding goddess. Such a state of affairs is doubly interesting  in view of the pre-eminence of female deities in the early Greek world,  which has been so strikingly shown by Miss Jane Harrison in her recent  book, _Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion_.    The most vital question which can be put to almost any religion is that  in regard to its expansive power and its adaptability to new conditions.  Society is bound to undergo changes, and a young social organism, if  normal, is continually growing new cells. New conditions are arising and  new interests are coming to the front. In addition, if the growth is to  be continuous, new material is being constantly absorbed, and the simple  homogeneous character of the old society is being entirely changed by  the influx of foreign elements. This is what occurred in ancient Rome,  and it is because ancient Roman religion was not capable of organic  development from within, that the curious things happened to it which  our history has to record. It is these strange external accretions which  lend the chief interest to the story, while at the same time they  conceal the original form so fully as to render the writing of a history  of Roman religion extremely difficult.    Yet it must not be supposed because Roman religion was unable to adapt  itself to the new constitution of society with its contrasted classes,  and to the new commercial and political interests which attracted the  attention of the upper classes, that it was absolutely devoid within  itself, within its own limitations, of a certain capability of  development. For several centuries after outside influences began to  affect Rome, her original religion kept on developing alongside of the  new forms. The manner in which it developed is thoroughly significant of  the original national character of the Romans.    We have seen that from the very beginning the nature of the gods as  powers rather than personalities tended to emphasise the value and  importance of the name, which usually indicated the particular function  or speciality of each deity and was very often the only thing known  about him. In the course of time as the original name of the deity began  to be thought of entirely as a proper name without any meaning, rather  than as a common noun explaining the nature of the god to which it was  attached, it became necessary to add to the original name some adjective  which would adequately describe the god and do the work which the name  by itself had originally done. And as the nature of the various deities  grew more complicated along with the increasing complications of daily  life, new adjectives were added, each one expressing some particular  phase of the god's activity. Such an adjective was called a _cognomen_,  and was often of very great importance because it began to be felt that  a god with one adjective, _i.e._ invoked for one purpose, was almost a  different god from the same god with a different adjective, _i.e._  invoked for another purpose. Thus a knowledge of these adjectives was  almost as necessary as a knowledge of the name of the god. The next step  in the development was one which followed very easily. These important  adjectives began to be thought of as having a value and an existence in  themselves, apart from the god to which they were attached. The  grammatical change which accompanied this psychological movement was the  transfer of the adjective into an abstract noun. Both adjectives and  abstract nouns express quality, but the adjective is in a condition of  dependence on a noun, while the abstract noun is independent and  self-supporting. And thus, just as in certain of the lower organisms a  group of cells breaks off and sets up an individual organism of its own,  so in old Roman religion some phase of a god's activity, expressed in an  adjective, broke off with the adjective from its original stock and set  up for itself, turning its name from the dependent adjective form into  the independent abstract noun. Thus Juppiter, worshipped as a god of  good faith in the dealings of men with one another, the god by whom  oaths were sworn under the open sky, was designated as \"Juppiter,  guarding-good-faith,\" Juppiter Fidius. There were however many other  phases of Juppiter's work, and hence the adjective _fidius_ became very  important as the means of distinguishing this activity from all the  others. Eventually it broke off from Juppiter and formed the abstract  noun _Fides_, the goddess of good faith, where the sex of the deity as a  goddess was entirely determined by the grammatical gender of abstract  nouns as feminine.    This is all strange enough but there is one more step in the development  even more curious yet. This abstract goddess _Fides_ did not stay long  in the purely abstract sphere; she began very soon to be made concrete  again, as the Fides of this particular person or of that particular  group and as this Fides or that, until she became almost as concrete as  Juppiter himself had been, and hence we have a great many different  _Fides_ in seeming contradiction to the old grammatical rule that  abstract nouns had no plural. Now all this development in the field of  religion throws light upon the character of the Roman mind and its  instinctive methods of thought, and we see why it is that the Romans  were very great lawyers and very mediocre philosophers. Both law and  philosophy require the ability for abstract thought; in both cases the  essential qualities of a thing must be separated from the thing itself.  But in the case of philosophic thought this abstraction, these  qualities, do not immediately seek reincarnation. They continue as  abstractions and do not immediately descend to earth again, whereas for  law such a descent is absolutely necessary because jurisprudence is  interested not so much in the abstraction by itself, but rather in the  abstract as presented in concrete cases. Hence a type of mind which  found it equally easy to make the concrete into the abstract and then to  turn the abstract so made into a kind of concrete again, is _par  excellence_ the legal mind, and no better proof of the instinctive  tendency to law-making on the part of the Romans can be found than in  the fact that the same habits of mind which make laws also governed the  development of their religion.    Unfortunately however it was not these abstract deities who could save  old Roman religion. They were merely the"]]]
