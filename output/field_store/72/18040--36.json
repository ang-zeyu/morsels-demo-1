You are angry      now, but you will some time pity and forgive your poor      Florence, who will never cease to bless and pray for you.      Good-bye!                                                     \"Florence.\"    She was about to sign herself Florence Linden, but reflected that she  was no longer entitled to use a name which would seem to carry with it  a claim upon her uncle.    The tears fell upon the paper as she was writing, but she heeded them  not. It was the saddest hour of her life. Hitherto she had been  shielded from all sorrow, and secure in the affection of her uncle,  had never dreamed that there would come a time when she would feel  obliged to leave all behind her, and go out into the world, friendless  and penniless, but poorest of all in the loss of that love which she  had hitherto enjoyed.    After completing the note, Florence let her head fall upon the table,  and sobbed herself to sleep.    An hour and a half passed, the servant looked in, but noticing that  her mistress was sleeping, contented herself with lowering the gas,  but refrained from waking her.    And so she slept on till the French clock upon the mantle struck  eleven.    Five minutes later and the door of the room slowly opened, and a boy  entered on tiptoe. He was roughly dressed. His figure was manly and  vigorous, and despite his stealthy step and suspicious movements his  face was prepossessing.    He started when he saw Florence.    \"What, a sleeping gal!\" he said to himself. \"Tim told me I'd find the  coast clear, but I guess she's sound asleep, and won't hear nothing. I  don't half like this job, but I've got to do as Tim told me. He says  he's my father, so I s'pose it's all right. All the same, I shall be  nabbed some day, and then the family'll be disgraced. It's a queer  life I've led ever since I can remember. Sometimes I feel like leaving  Tim, and settin' up for myself. I wonder how 'twould seem to be  respectable.\"    The boy approached the secretary, and with some tools he had brought  essayed to open it. After a brief delay he succeeded, and lifted the  cover. He was about to explore it, according to Tim's directions, when  he heard a cry of fear, and turning swiftly saw Florence, her eyes  dilated with terror, gazing at him.    \"Who are you?\" she asked in alarm, \"and what are you doing there?\"          Chapter V.  Dodger.      The boy sprang to the side of Florence, and siezed her wrists in his  strong young grasp.    \"Don't you alarm the house,\" he said, \"or I'll----\"    \"What will you do?\" gasped Florence, in alarm. The boy was evidently  softened by her beauty, and answered in a tone of hesitation:    \"I don't know. I won't harm you if you keep quiet.\"    \"What are you here for?\" asked Florence, fixing her eyes on the boy's  face; \"are you a thief?\"    \"I don't know--yes, I suppose I am.\"    \"How sad, when you are so young.\"    \"What! miss, do you pity me?\"    \"Yes, my poor boy, you must be very poor, or you wouldn't bring  yourself to steal.\"    \"No. I ain't poor; leastways, I have enough to eat, and I have a place  to sleep.\"    \"Then why don't you earn your living by honest means?\"    \"I can't; I must obey orders.\"    \"Whose orders?\"    \"Why, the guv'nor's, to be sure.\"    \"Did he tell you to open that secretary?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Who is the guv'nor, as you call him?\"    \"I can't tell; it wouldn't be square.\"    \"He must be a very wicked man.\"    \"Well, he ain't exactly what you call an angel, but I've seen wuss men  than the guv'nor.\"    \"Do you mind telling me your own name?\"    \"No; for I know you won't peach on me. Tom Dodger.\"    \"Dodger?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"That isn't a surname.\"    \"It's all I've got. That's what I'm always called.\"    \"It is very singular,\" said Florence, fixing a glance of mingled  curiosity and perplexity upon the young visitor.    While the two were earnestly conversing in that subdued light,  afforded by the lowered gaslight, Tim Bolton crept in through the door  unobserved by either, tiptoed across the room to the secretary,  snatched the will and a roll of bills, and escaped without attracting  attention.    \"Oh, I wish I could persuade you to give up this bad life,\" resumed  Florence, earnestly, \"and become honest.\"    \"Do you really care what becomes of me, miss?\" asked Dodger, slowly.    \"I do, indeed.\"    \"That's very kind of you, miss; but I don't understand it. You are a  rich young lady, and I'm only a poor boy, livin' in a Bowery dive.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Never mind, miss, such as you wouldn't understand. Why, all my life  I've lived with thieves, and drunkards, and bunco men, and----\"    \"But I'm sure you don't like it. You are fit for something better.\"    \"Do you really think so?\" asked Dodger, doubtfullly.    \"Yes; you have a good face. You were meant to be good and honest, I am  sure.\"    \"Would you trust me?\" asked the boy, earnestly, fixing his large, dark  eyes eloquently on the face of Florence.    \"Yes, I would if you would only leave your evil companions, and become  true to your better nature.\"    \"No one ever spoke to me like that before, miss,\" said Dodger, his  expressive features showing that he was strongly moved. \"You think I  could be good if I tried hard, and grow up respectable?\"    \"I am sure you could,\" said Florence, confidently.    There was something in this boy, young outlaw though he was, that  moved her powerfully, and even fascinated her, though she hardly  realized it. It was something more than a feeling of compassion for a  wayward and misguided youth.    \"I could if I was rich like you, and lived in a nice house, and  'sociated with swells. If you had a father like mine----\"    \"Is he a bad man?\"    \"Well, he don't belong to the church. He keeps a gin mill, and has  ever since I was a kid.\"    \"Have you always lived with him?\"    \"Yes, but not in New York.\"    \"Where then?\"    \"In Melbourne.\"    \"That's in Australia.\"    \"Yes, miss.\"    \"How long since you came to New York?\"    \"I guess it's about three years.\"    \"And you have always had this man as a guardian? Poor boy!\"    \"You've got a different father from me, miss?\"    Tears forced themselves to the eyes of Florence, as this remark  brought forcibly to her mind the position in which she was placed.    \"Alas!\" she answered, impulsively, \"I am alone in the world!\"    \"What! ain't the old gentleman that lives here your father?\"    \"He is my uncle; but he is very, very angry with me, and has this very  day ordered me to leave the house.\"    \"Why, what a cantankerous old ruffian he is, to be sure!\" exclaimed  the boy, indignantly.    \"Hush! you must not talk against my uncle. He has always been kind to  me till now.\"    \"Why, what's up? What's the old gentleman mad about?\"    \"He wants me to marry my cousin Curtis--a man I do not even like.\"    \"That's a shame! Is it the dude I saw come out of the house a little  while ago?\"    \"Oh, no; that's a different gentleman. It's Mr. de Brabazon.\"    \"You don't want to marry him, do you?\"    \"No, no!\"    \"I'm glad of that. He don't look as if he knew enough to come in when  it rained.\"    \"The poor young man is not very brilliant, but I think I would rather  marry him than Curtis Waring.\"    \"I've seen him, too. He's got dark hair and a dark complexion, and a  wicked look in his eye.\"    \"You, too, have noticed that?\"    \"I've seen such as him before. He's a bad man.\"    \"Do you know anything about him?\" asked Florence, eagerly.    \"Only his looks.\"    \"I am not deceived,\" murmured Florence, \"it's not wholly prejudice.  The boy distrusts him, too. So you see, Dodger,\" she added, aloud, \"I  am not a rich young lady, as you suppose. I must leave this house, and  work for my living. I have no home any more.\"    \"If you have no home,\" said Dodger, impulsively, \"come home with me.\"    \"To the home you have described, my poor boy? How could I do that?\"    \"No; I will hire a room for you in a quiet street, and you shall be my  sister. I will work for you, and give you my money.\"    \"You are kind, and I am glad to think I have found a friend when I  need one most. But I could not accept stolen money. It would be as bad  as if I, too, were a thief.\"    \"I am not a thief! That is, I won't be any more.\"    \"And you will give up your plan of robbing my uncle?\"    \"Yes, I will; though I don't know what my guv'nor will say. He'll half  murder me, I expect. He'll be sure to cut up rough.\"    \"Do right, Dodger, whatever happens. Promise me that you will never  steal again?\"    \"There's my hand, miss--I promise. Nobody ever talked to me like you.  I never thought much about bein' respectable, and growin' up to be  somebody, but if you take an interest in me, I'll try hard to do  right.\"    At this moment, Mr. Linden, clad in a long morning gown, and holding a  candle in his hand, entered the room, and started in astonishment when  he saw Florence clasping the hand of one whose appearance led him to  stamp as a young rough.    \"Shameless girl!\" he exclaimed, in stern reproof. \"So this is the  company you keep when you think I am out of the way!\"          Chapter VI.  A Tempest.      The charge was so strange and unexpected that Florence was  overwhelmed. She could only murmur:    \"Oh, uncle!\"    Her young companion was indignant. Already he felt that Florence had  consented to accept him as a friend, and he was resolved to stand by  her.    \"I say, old man,\" he bristled up, \"don't you go to insult her! She's  an angel!\"    \"No doubt you think so,\" rejoined Mr. Linden, in a tone of sarcasm.  \"Upon my word, miss, I congratulate you on your elevated taste. So  this is your reason for not being willing to marry your Cousin  Curtis?\"    \"Indeed, uncle, you are mistaken. I never met this boy till to-night.\"    \"Don't try to deceive me. Young man, did you open my secretary?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"And robbed it into the bargain,\" continued"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1860"],[0,"Westward Ho! Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#4)"],[1,"t, shopkeeper and sailor; or  riding along the moorland roads between his houses of Stow and Bideford,  while every woman ran out to her door to look at the great Sir Richard,  the pride of North Devon; or, sitting there in the low mullioned window  at Burrough, with his cup of malmsey before him, and the lute to which  he had just been singing laid across his knees, while the red western  sun streamed in upon his high, bland forehead, and soft curling locks;  ever the same steadfast, God-fearing, chivalrous man, conscious (as far  as a soul so healthy could be conscious) of the pride of beauty, and  strength, and valor, and wisdom, and a race and name which claimed  direct descent from the grandfather of the Conqueror, and was tracked  down the centuries by valiant deeds and noble benefits to his native  shire, himself the noblest of his race. Men said that he was proud; but  he could not look round him without having something to be proud of;  that he was stern and harsh to his sailors: but it was only when he saw  in them any taint of cowardice or falsehood; that he was subject, at  moments, to such fearful fits of rage, that he had been seen to snatch  the glasses from the table, grind them to pieces in his teeth, and  swallow them: but that was only when his indignation had been aroused by  some tale of cruelty or oppression, and, above all, by those West Indian  devilries of the Spaniards, whom he regarded (and in those days rightly  enough) as the enemies of God and man. Of this last fact Oxenham was  well aware, and therefore felt somewhat puzzled and nettled, when, after  having asked Mr. Leigh's leave to take young Amyas with him and set  forth in glowing colors the purpose of his voyage, he found Sir Richard  utterly unwilling to help him with his suit.    \"Heyday, Sir Richard! You are not surely gone over to the side of those  canting fellows (Spanish Jesuits in disguise, every one of them, they  are), who pretended to turn up their noses at Franky Drake, as a pirate,  and be hanged to them?\"    \"My friend Oxenham,\" answered he, in the sententious and measured style  of the day, \"I have always held, as you should know by this, that Mr.  Drake's booty, as well as my good friend Captain Hawkins's, is lawful  prize, as being taken from the Spaniard, who is not only hostis humani  generis, but has no right to the same, having robbed it violently, by  torture and extreme iniquity, from the poor Indian, whom God avenge, as  He surely will.\"    \"Amen,\" said Mrs. Leigh.    \"I say Amen, too,\" quoth Oxenham, \"especially if it please Him to avenge  them by English hands.\"    \"And I also,\" went on Sir Richard; \"for the rightful owners of the said  goods being either miserably dead, or incapable, by reason of their  servitude, of ever recovering any share thereof, the treasure, falsely  called Spanish, cannot be better bestowed than in building up the state  of England against them, our natural enemies; and thereby, in building  up the weal of the Reformed Churches throughout the world, and the  liberties of all nations, against a tyranny more foul and rapacious than  that of Nero or Caligula; which, if it be not the cause of God, I, for  one, know not what God's cause is!\" And, as he warmed in his speech, his  eyes flashed very fire.    \"Hark now!\" said Oxenham, \"who can speak more boldly than he? and yet he  will not help this lad to so noble an adventure.\"    \"You have asked his father and mother; what is their answer?\"    \"Mine is this,\" said Mr. Leigh; \"if it be God's will that my boy should  become, hereafter, such a mariner as Sir Richard Grenville, let him go,  and God be with him; but let him first bide here at home and be  trained, if God give me grace, to become such a gentleman as Sir Richard  Grenville.\"    Sir Richard bowed low, and Mrs. Leigh catching up the last word--    \"There, Mr. Oxenham, you cannot gainsay that, unless you will be  discourteous to his worship. And for me--though it be a weak woman's  reason, yet it is a mother's: he is my only child. His elder brother is  far away. God only knows whether I shall see him again; and what are all  reports of his virtues and his learning to me, compared to that sweet  presence which I daily miss? Ah! Mr. Oxenham, my beautiful Joseph is  gone; and though he be lord of Pharaoh's household, yet he is far away  in Egypt; and you will take Benjamm also! Ah! Mr. Oxenham, you have no  child, or you would not ask for mine!\"    \"And how do you know that, my sweet madam!\" said the adventurer, turning  first deadly pale, and then glowing red. Her last words had touched him  to the quick in some unexpected place; and rising, he courteously laid  her hand to his lips, and said--\"I say no more. Farewell, sweet madam,  and God send all men such wives as you.\"    \"And all wives,\" said she, smiling, \"such husbands as mine.\"    \"Nay, I will not say that,\" answered he, with a half sneer--and then,  \"Farewell, friend Leigh--farewell, gallant Dick Grenville. God send I  see thee Lord High Admiral when I come home. And yet, why should I come  home? Will you pray for poor Jack, gentles?\"    \"Tut, tut, man! good words,\" said Leigh; \"let us drink to our merry  meeting before you go.\" And rising, and putting the tankard of malmsey  to his lips, he passed it to Sir Richard, who rose, and saying, \"To the  fortune of a bold mariner and a gallant gentleman,\" drank, and put the  cup into Oxenham's hand.    The adventurer's face was flushed, and his eye wild. Whether from the  liquor he had drunk during the day, or whether from Mrs. Leigh's last  speech, he had not been himself for a few minutes. He lifted the cup,  and was in act to pledge them, when he suddenly dropped it on the table,  and pointed, staring and trembling, up and down, and round the room, as  if following some fluttering object.    \"There! Do you see it? The bird!--the bird with the white breast!\"    Each looked at the other; but Leigh, who was a quick-witted man and an  old courtier, forced a laugh instantly, and cried--\"Nonsense, brave Jack  Oxenham! Leave white birds for men who will show the white feather. Mrs.  Leigh waits to pledge you.\"    Oxenham recovered himself in a moment, pledged them all round, drinking  deep and fiercely; and after hearty farewells, departed, never hinting  again at his strange exclamation.    After he was gone, and while Leigh was attending him to the door, Mrs.  Leigh and Grenville kept a few minutes' dead silence. At last--\"God help  him!\" said she.    \"Amen!\" said Grenville, \"for he never needed it more. But, indeed,  madam, I put no faith in such omens.\"    \"But, Sir Richard, that bird has been seen for generations before the  death of any of his family. I know those who were at South Tawton when  his mother died, and his brother also; and they both saw it. God help  him! for, after all, he is a proper man.\"    \"So many a lady has thought before now, Mrs. Leigh, and well for him if  they had not. But, indeed, I make no account of omens. When God is ready  for each man, then he must go; and when can he go better?\"    \"But,\" said Mr. Leigh, who entered, \"I have seen, and especially when  I was in Italy, omens and prophecies before now beget their own  fulfilment, by driving men into recklessness, and making them run  headlong upon that very ruin which, as they fancied, was running upon  them.\"    \"And which,\" said Sir Richard, \"they might have avoided, if, instead of  trusting in I know not what dumb and dark destiny, they had trusted in  the living God, by faith in whom men may remove mountains, and quench  the fire, and put to flight the armies of the alien. I too know, and  know not how I know, that I shall never die in my bed.\"    \"God forfend!\" cried Mrs. Leigh.    \"And why, fair madam, if I die doing my duty to my God and my queen? The  thought never moves me: nay, to tell the truth, I pray often enough that  I may be spared the miseries of imbecile old age, and that end which  the old Northmen rightly called 'a cow's death' rather than a man's. But  enough of this. Mr. Leigh, you have done wisely to-night. Poor Oxenham  does not go on his voyage with a single eye. I have talked about him  with Drake and Hawkins; and I guess why Mrs. Leigh touched him so home  when she told him that he had no child.\"    \"Has he one, then, in the West Indies?\" cried the good lady.    \"God knows; and God grant we may not hear of shame and sorrow fallen  upon an ancient and honorable house of Devon. My brother Stukely is woe  enough to North Devon for this generation.\"    \"Poor braggadocio!\" said Mr. Leigh; \"and yet not altogether that too,  for he can fight at least.\"    \"So can every mastiff and boar, much more an Englishman. And now come  hither to me, my adventurous godson, and don't look in such doleful  dumps. I hear you have broken all the sailor-boys' heads already.\"    \"Nearly all,\" said young Amyas, with due modesty.. \"But am I not to go  to sea?\"    \"All things in their time, my boy, and God forbid that either I or your  worthy parents should keep you from that noble calling which is the  safeguard of this England and her queen. But you do not wish to live and  die the master of a trawler?\"    \"I should like to be a brave adventurer, like Mr. Oxenham.\"    \"God grant you become a braver man than he! for, as I think, to be bold  against the enemy is common to the brutes; but the prerogative of a man  is to be bold against himself.\"    \"How, sir?\"    \"To conquer our own fancies, Amyas, and our own lusts, and our ambition,  in the sacred name of duty; this it is to be truly brave, and truly  strong; for he who cannot rule himself, how can he rule his crew or his  fortunes? Come, now, I will make you a promise. If you will bide quietly  at home, and learn from your father and mother all which befits a  gentleman and a Christian, as well as a seaman, the day shall come when  you shall sail with Richard Grenville himself, or with better men than  he, on a nobler errand than gold-hun"]]]
