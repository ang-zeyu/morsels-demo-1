The warrior, a strong, coarse-membered,  heavily muscled creation, with a heavy, expressionless, Semitic face,  appeared everywhere. The figure was placed in profile, with eye and  bust twisted to show the front view, and the long feet projected one  beyond the other, as in the Nile pictures. This was the Assyrian ideal  of strength, dignity, and majesty, established probably in the early  ages, and repeated for centuries with few characteristic variations.  The figure was usually given in motion, walking, or riding, and had  little of that grace seen in Egyptian painting, but in its place a  great deal of rude strength. In modelling, the human form was not so  knowingly rendered as the animal. The long Eastern clothing probably  prevented the close study of the figure. This failure in anatomical  exactness was balanced in part by minute details in the dress and  accessories, productive of a rich ornamental effect.    Hard stone was not found in the Mesopotamian regions. Temples were  built of burnt brick, bas-reliefs were made upon alabaster slabs and  heightened by coloring, and painting was largely upon tiles, with  mineral paints, afterward glazed by fire. These glazed brick or tiles,  with figured designs, were fixed upon the walls, arches, and  archivolts by bitumen mortar, and made up the first mosaics of which  we have record. There was a further painting upon plaster in  distemper, of which some few traces remain. It did not differ in  design from the bas-reliefs or the tile mosaics.    The subjects used were the Assyrian type, shown somewhat slighter in  painting than in sculpture, animals, birds, and other objects; but  they were obviously not attempts at nature. The color was arbitrary,  not natural, and there was little perspective, light-and-shade, or  relief. Heavy outline bands of color appeared about the object, and  the prevailing hues were yellow and blue. There was perhaps less  symbolism and more direct representation in Assyria than in Egypt.  There was also more feeling for perspective and space, as shown in  such objects as water and in the mountain landscapes of the late  bas-reliefs; but, in the main, there was no advance upon Egypt. There  was a difference which was not necessarily a development. Painting, as  we know the art to-day, was not practised in Chaldaea-Assyria. It was  never free from a servitude to architecture and sculpture; it was  hampered by conventionalities; and the painter was more artisan than  artist, having little freedom or individuality.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--WILD ASS. BAS-RELIEF, BRITISH MUSEUM. (FROM  PERROT AND CHIPIEZ.)]    HISTORIC PERIODS: Chaldaea, of unknown antiquity, with Babylon its  capital, is accounted the oldest nation in the Tigris-Euphrates  valley, and, so far as is known, it was an original nation producing  an original art. Its sculpture (especially in the Tello heads), and  presumably its painting, were more realistic and individual than any  other in the valley. Assyria coming later, and the heir of Chaldaea,  was the    Second Empire: There are two distinct periods of this Second Empire, the  first lasting from 1,400 B.C., down to about 900 B.C., and in art  showing a great profusion of bas-reliefs. The second closed about 625  B.C., and in art produced much glazed-tile work and a more elaborate  sculpture and painting. After this the Chaldaean provinces gained the  ascendency again, and Babylon, under Nebuchadnezzar, became the first  city of Asia. But the new Babylon did not last long. It fell before  Cyrus and the Persians 536 B.C. Again, as in Egypt, the earliest art  appears the purest and the simplest, and the years of Chaldaeo-Assyrian  history known to us carry a record of change rather than of progress in  art.         ART REMAINS: The most valuable collections of       Chaldaeo-Assyrian art are to be found in the Louvre and the       British Museum. The other large museums of Europe have       collections in this department, but all of them combined are       little compared with the treasures that still lie buried in       the mounds of the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Excavations have       been made at Mugheir, Warka, Khorsabad, Kouyunjik, and       elsewhere, but many difficulties have thus far rendered       systematic work impossible. The complete history of       Chaldaeo-Assyria and its art has yet to be written.      PERSIAN PAINTING.         BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before cited, Babelon, Duncker,       Lenormant, Ely; Dieulafoy, _L'Art Antique de la Perse_;       Flandin et Coste, _Voyage en Perse_; Justi, _Geschichte des       alten Persiens_; Perrot and Chipiez, _History of Art in       Persia_.      HISTORY AND ART MOTIVES: The Medes and Persians were the natural  inheritors of Assyrian civilization, but they did not improve their  birthright. The Medes soon lost their power. Cyrus conquered them, and  established the powerful Persian monarchy upheld for two hundred years  by Cambyses, Darius, and Xerxes. Substantially the same conditions  surrounded the Persians as the Assyrians--that is, so far as art  production was concerned. Their conceptions of life were similar, and  their use of art was for historic illustration of kingly doings and  ornamental embellishment of kingly palaces. Both sculpture and  painting were accessories of architecture.    Of Median art nothing remains. The Persians left the record, but it  was not wholly of their own invention, nor was it very extensive or  brilliant. It had little originality about it, and was really only an  echo of Assyria. The sculptors and painters copied their Assyrian  predecessors, repeating at Persepolis what had been better told at  Nineveh.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--LIONS' FRIEZE, SUSA. (FROM PERROT AND CHIPIEZ.)]    TYPES AND TECHNIC: The same subjects, types, and technical methods in  bas-relief, tile, and painting on plaster were followed under Darius  as under Shalmanezer. But the imitation was not so good as the  original. The warrior, the winged monsters, the animals all lost  something of their air of brutal defiance and their strength of  modelling. Heroes still walked in procession along the bas-reliefs and  glazed tiles, but the figure was smaller, more effeminate, the hair  and beard were not so long, the drapery fell in slightly indicated  folds at times, and there was a profusion of ornamental detail. Some  of this detail and some modifications in the figure showed the  influence of foreign nations other than the Greek; but, in the main,  Persian art followed in the footsteps of Assyrian art. It was the last  reflection of Mesopotamian splendor. For with the conquest of Persia  by Alexander the book of expressive art in that valley was closed,  and, under Islam, it remains closed to this day.         ART REMAINS: Persian painting is something about which       little is known because little remains. The Louvre contains       some reconstructed friezes made in mosaics of stamped brick       and square tile, showing figures of lions and a number of       archers. The coloring is particularly rich, and may give       some idea of Persian pigments. Aside from the chief museums       of Europe the bulk of Persian art is still seen half-buried       in the ruins of Persepolis and elsewhere.      PHOENICIAN, CYPRIOTE, AND ASIA MINOR PAINTING.         BOOKS RECOMMENDED: As before cited, Babelon, Duncker, Ely,       Girard, Lenormant; Cesnola, _Cyprus_; Cesnola, _Cypriote       Antiquities in Metropolitan Museum of Art_; Kenrick,       _Phoenicia_; Movers, _Die Phonizier_; Perrot and Chipiez,       _History of Art in Phoenicia and Cyprus_; Perrot and       Chipiez, _History of Art in Sardinia, Judea, Syria and Asia       Minor_; Perrot and Chipiez, _History of Art in Phrygia,       Lydia, etc._; Renan, _Mission de Phenicie_.      THE TRADING NATIONS: The coast-lying nations of the Eastern  Mediterranean were hardly original or creative nations in a large  sense. They were at different times the conquered dependencies of  Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece, and their lands were but bridges over  which armies passed from east to west or from west to east. Located on  the Mediterranean between the great civilizations of antiquity they  naturally adapted themselves to circumstances, and became the  middlemen, the brokers, traders, and carriers of the ancient world.  Their lands were not favorable to agriculture, but their sea-coasts  rendered commerce easy and lucrative. They made a kingdom of the sea,  and their means of livelihood were gathered from it. There is no  record that the Egyptians ever traversed the Mediterranean, the  Assyrians were not sailors, the Greeks had not yet arisen, and so  probably Phoenicia and her neighbors had matters their own way.  Colonies and trading stations were established at Cyprus, Carthage,  Sardinia, the Greek islands, and the Greek mainland, and not only  Eastern goods but Eastern ideas were thus carried to the West.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--PAINTED HEAD FROM EDESSA. (FROM PERROT AND  CHIPIEZ.)]    Politically, socially, and religiously these small middle nations were  inconsequential. They simply adapted their politics or faith to the  nation that for the time had them under its heel. What semi-original  religion they possessed was an amalgamation of the religions of other  nations, and their gods of bronze, terra-cotta, and enamel were  irreverently sold in the market like any other produce.    ART MOTIVES AND METHODS: Building, carving, and painting were  practised among the coastwise nations, but upon no such extensive  scale as in either Egypt or Assyria. The mere fact that they were  people of the sea rather than of the land precluded extensive or  concentrated development. Politically Phoenicia was divided among  five cities, and her artistic strength was distributed in a similar  manner. Such art as was produced showed the religious and decorative  motives, and in its"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18908"],[0,"Christmas (#4)"],[1,"e; heap offerings on its emerald branches;  bring the Yule log to the firing; deck the house with holly and  mistletoe,        \"And all the bells on earth shall ring      On Christmas day in the morning.\"           *       *       *       *       *        THE SHEPHERDS        WILLIAM DRUMMOND, OF HAWTHORNDEN        O than the fairest day, thrice fairer night!        Night to blest days in which a sun doth rise        Of which that golden eye which clears the skies      Is but a sparkling ray, a shadow-light!      And blessed ye, in silly pastor's sight,        Mild creatures, in whose warm crib now lies      That heaven-sent youngling, holy-maid-born wight,        Midst, end, beginning of our prophecies!        Blest cottage that hath flowers in winter spread,        Though withered--blessed grass that hath the grace        To deck and be a carpet to that place!      Thus sang, unto the sounds of oaten reed,        Before the Babe, the shepherds bowed on knees;        And springs ran nectar, honey dropped from trees.            *       *       *       *       *        A CHRISTMAS CAROL        JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL        \"What means this glory round our feet,\"        The Magi mused, \"more bright than morn?\"      And voices chanted clear and sweet,        \"To-day the Prince of Peace is born!\"        \"What means that star,\" the Shepherds said,        \"That brightens through the rocky glen?\"      And angels, answering overhead,        Sang, \"Peace on earth, good-will to men!\"        'Tis eighteen hundred years and more        Since those sweet oracles were dumb;      We wait for Him, like them of yore;        Alas, He seems so slow to come!        But it was said, in words of gold,        No time or sorrow e'er shall dim,      That little children might be bold        In perfect trust to come to Him.        All round about our feet shall shine        A light like that the wise men saw,      If we our loving wills incline        To that sweet Life which is the Law.        So shall we learn to understand        The simple faith of shepherds then,      And, clasping kindly hand in hand,        Sing, \"Peace on earth, good-will to men!\"        But they who do their souls no wrong,        But keep at eve the faith of morn,      Shall daily hear the angel-song,        \"To-day the Prince of Peace is born!\"           *       *       *       *       *        A CHRISTMAS HYMN        ALFRED DOMETT        It was the calm and silent night!        Seven hundred years and fifty-three      Had Rome been growing up to might,        And now was Queen of land and sea.      No sound was heard of clashing wars;        Peace brooded o'er the hush'd domain;      Apollo, Pallas, Jove and Mars,        Held undisturb'd their ancient reign,             In the solemn midnight                 Centuries ago.        'T was in the calm and silent night!        The senator of haughty Rome      Impatient urged his chariot's flight,        From lordly revel rolling home.      Triumphal arches gleaming swell        His breast with thoughts of boundless sway;      What reck'd the Roman what befell        A paltry province far away,              In the solemn midnight                  Centuries ago!        Within that province far away        Went plodding home a weary boor:      A streak of light before him lay,        Fall'n through a half-shut stable door      Across his path. He pass'd--for nought        Told what was going on within;      How keen the stars! his only thought;        The air how calm and cold and thin,             In the solemn midnight                  Centuries ago!        O strange indifference!--low and high        Drows'd over common joys and cares:      The earth was still--but knew not why;        The world was listening--unawares.      How calm a moment may precede        One that shall thrill the world for ever!      To that still moment none would heed,        Man's doom was link'd, no more to sever,              In the solemn midnight                  Centuries ago.        It _is_ the calm and solemn night        A thousand bells ring out, and throw      Their joyous peals abroad, and smite        The darkness, charm'd and holy now.      The night that erst no name had worn,        To it a happy name is given;      For in that stable lay new-born        The peaceful Prince of Earth and Heaven,             In the solemn midnight                 Centuries ago.           *       *       *       *       *        BRIGHTEST AND BEST OF THE SONS OF THE MORNING        REGINALD HEBER        Brightest and best of the Sons of the morning!

Cold on His cradle the dewdrops are shining,        Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall;      Angels adore Him in slumber reclining,        Maker and Monarch and Saviour of all!        Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion,        Odors of Edom and offerings divine?      Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean,        Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?        Vainly we offer each ample oblation;        Vainly with gifts would His favor secure:      Richer by far is the heart's adoration;        Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

God rest ye, little children; let nothing you affright,      For Jesus Christ, your Saviour, was born this happy night;      Along the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping lay,      When Christ, the child of Nazareth, was born on Christmas-day.        God rest ye, all good Christians; upon this blessed morn      The Lord of all good Christians was of a woman born:      Now all your sorrows He doth heal, your sins He takes away;      For Jesus Christ, our Saviour, was born on Christmas-day.           *       *       *       *       *        THE CHRISTMAS SILENCE        MARGARET DELAND        Hushed are the pigeons cooing low        On dusty rafters of the loft;        And mild-eyed oxen, breathing soft,      Sleep on the fragrant hay below.        Dim shadows in the corner hide;        The glimmering lantern's rays are shed        Where one young lamb just lifts his head,      Then huddles 'gainst his mother's side.        Strange silence tingles in the air;        Through the half-open door a bar        Of light from one low-hanging star      Touches a baby's radiant hair.        No sound: the mother, kneeling, lays        Her cheek against the little face.        Oh human love! Oh heavenly grace!      'Tis yet in silence that she prays!        Ages of silence end to-night;        Then to the long-expectant earth        Glad angels come to greet His birth      In burst of music, love, and light!           *       *       *       *       *        A CHRISTMAS LULLABY        JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS        Sleep, baby, sleep!
