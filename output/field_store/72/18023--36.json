The great mystics like St. John of the Cross, are  primarily for readers with a special determination of purpose; the  devotional writers, such as St. Francois de Sales, are primarily for  those who already feel consciously desirous of the love of God; the  great theologians are for those interested in theology. But I can think  of no Christian writer, not Newman even, more to be commended than  Pascal to those who doubt, but who have the mind to conceive, and the  sensibility to feel, the disorder, the futility, the meaninglessness,  the mystery of life and suffering, and who can only find peace through a  satisfaction of the whole being.

SECTION I    THOUGHTS ON MIND AND ON STYLE      1      _The difference between the mathematical and the intuitive mind._[1]--In  the one the principles are palpable, but removed from ordinary use; so  that for want of habit it is difficult to turn one's mind in that  direction: but if one turns it thither ever so little, one sees the  principles fully, and one must have a quite inaccurate mind who reasons  wrongly from principles so plain that it is almost impossible they  should escape notice.    But in the intuitive mind the principles are found in common use, and  are before the eyes of everybody. One has only to look, and no effort is  necessary; it is only a question of good eyesight, but it must be good,  for the principles are so subtle and so numerous, that it is almost  impossible but that some escape notice. Now the omission of one  principle leads to error; thus one must have very clear sight to see all  the principles, and in the next place an accurate mind not to draw false  deductions from known principles.    All mathematicians would then be intuitive if they had clear sight, for  they do not reason incorrectly from principles known to them; and  intuitive minds would be mathematical if they could turn their eyes to  the principles of mathematics to which they are unused.    The reason, therefore, that some intuitive minds are not mathematical is  that they cannot at all turn their attention to the principles of  mathematics. But the reason that mathematicians are not intuitive is  that they do not see what is before them, and that, accustomed to the  exact and plain principles of mathematics, and not reasoning till they  have well inspected and arranged their principles, they are lost in  matters of intuition where the principles do not allow of such  arrangement. They are scarcely seen; they are felt rather than seen;  there is the greatest difficulty in making them felt by those who do  not of themselves perceive them. These principles are so fine and so  numerous that a very delicate and very clear sense is needed to perceive  them, and to judge rightly and justly when they are perceived, without  for the most part being able to demonstrate them in order as in  mathematics; because the principles are not known to us in the same way,  and because it would be an endless matter to undertake it. We must see  the matter at once, at one glance, and not by a process of reasoning, at  least to a certain degree. And thus it is rare that mathematicians are  intuitive, and that men of intuition are mathematicians, because  mathematicians wish to treat matters of intuition mathematically, and  make themselves ridiculous, wishing to begin with definitions and then  with axioms, which is not the way to proceed in this kind of reasoning.  Not that the mind does not do so, but it does it tacitly, naturally, and  without technical rules; for the expression of it is beyond all men, and  only a few can feel it.    Intuitive minds, on the contrary, being thus accustomed to judge at a  single glance, are so astonished when they are presented with  propositions of which they understand nothing, and the way to which is  through definitions and axioms so sterile, and which they are not  accustomed to see thus in detail, that they are repelled and  disheartened.    But dull minds are never either intuitive or mathematical.    Mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact minds, provided  all things are explained to them by means of definitions and axioms;  otherwise they are inaccurate and insufferable, for they are only right  when the principles are quite clear.    And men of intuition who are only intuitive cannot have the patience to  reach to first principles of things speculative and conceptual, which  they have never seen in the world, and which are altogether out of the  common.      2    There are different kinds of right understanding;[2] some have right  understanding in a certain order of things, and not in others, where  they go astray. Some draw conclusions well from a few premises, and this  displays an acute judgment.    Others draw conclusions well where there are many premises.    For example, the former easily learn hydrostatics, where the premises  are few, but the conclusions are so fine that only the greatest  acuteness can reach them.    And in spite of that these persons would perhaps not be great  mathematicians, because mathematics contain a great number of premises,  and there is perhaps a kind of intellect that can search with ease a few  premises to the bottom, and cannot in the least penetrate those matters  in which there are many premises.    There are then two kinds of intellect: the one able to penetrate acutely  and deeply into the conclusions of given premises, and this is the  precise intellect; the other able to comprehend a great number of  premises without confusing them, and this is the mathematical intellect.  The one has force and exactness, the other comprehension. Now the one  quality can exist without the other; the intellect can be strong and  narrow, and can also be comprehensive and weak.      3    Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the  process of reasoning, for they would understand at first sight, and are  not used to seek for principles. And others, on the contrary, who are  accustomed to reason from principles, do not at all understand matters  of feeling, seeking principles, and being unable to see at a glance.      4    _Mathematics, intuition._--True eloquence makes light of eloquence, true  morality makes light of morality; that is to say, the morality of the  judgment, which has no rules, makes light of the morality of the  intellect.    For it is to judgment that perception belongs, as science belongs to  intellect. Intuition is the part of judgment, mathematics of intellect.    To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.      5    Those who judge of a work by rule[3] are in regard to others as those  who have a watch are in regard to others. One says, \"It is two hours  ago\"; the other says, \"It is only three-quarters of an hour.\" I look at  my watch, and say to the one, \"You are weary,\" and to the other, \"Time  gallops with you\"; for it is only an hour and a half ago, and I laugh  at those who tell me that time goes slowly with me, and that I judge by  imagination. They do not know that I judge by my watch.[4]      6    Just as we harm the understanding, we harm the feelings also.    The understanding and the feelings are moulded by intercourse; the  understanding and feelings are corrupted by intercourse. Thus good or  bad society improves or corrupts them. It is, then, all-important to  know how to choose in order to improve and not to corrupt them; and we  cannot make this choice, if they be not already improved and not  corrupted. Thus a circle is formed, and those are fortunate who escape  it.      7    The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men.  Ordinary persons find no difference between men.      8    There are many people who listen to a sermon in the same way as they  listen to vespers.      9    When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another that he  errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that  side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him  the side on which it is false. He is satisfied with that, for he sees  that he was not mistaken, and that he only failed to see all sides. Now,  no one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be  mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#4)"],[1,"mplished, what is left of the teeth  is blackened.    The color is obtained in two ways. The more common method is to place a  piece of metal on one end of a bamboo[8] tube, the other extremity of  which rests on glowing coals. The smoke from the charring bamboo is  conducted through the tube to the cold metal on which it leaves a  deposit or \"sweat.\" This deposit is rubbed on the teeth, at intervals,  for several days until they become a shiny black. A second method is to  use a powder known as _tapEl_ which is secured from the _lamod_ tree.  The writer did not see this tree but, from the description given of it,  believes it to be the tamarindus. This powder is put on leaves and is  chewed. During the period of treatment the patient is under certain  restrictions. He may neither drink water, cook or eat anything sour, nor  may he attend a funeral. Should he do so his teeth will have a poor  color or be \"sick.\" When the teeth have been properly beautified the  young man or woman is considered ready to enter society.    [8] A variety known as _balakayo_ is used for this purpose.    Boys run about quite nude until they are three or four years of age.  Until about the same age the girls' sole garment is a little pubic  shield, cut from a coconut shell and decorated with incised lines filled  with lime (Fig. 7). Not infrequently bells are attached to the sides of  this \"garment.\" When children do begin to wear clothing their dress  differs in no respects from that of their elders.    FIG. 7. LITTLE GIRLS' PUBIC SHIELDS.    SKETCH OF FUNDAMENTAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.    Although we shall treat religion more fully in a later paragraph, it is  desirable that we now gain an idea of those beliefs which enter  intimately into every activity of the daily life of this people.    The Bagobo believes in a mighty company of superior beings who exercise  great control over the lives of men. Above all is Eugpamolak Manobo,  also called Manama, who was the first cause and creator of all. Serving  him is a vast number of spirits not malevolently inclined but capable of  exacting punishment unless proper offerings and other tokens of respect  are accorded them. Below them is a horde of low, mean spirits who  delight to annoy mankind with mischievous pranks, or even to bring  sickness and disaster to them. To this class generally belong the  spirits who inhabit mountains, cliffs, rooks, trees, rivers, and  springs. Standing between these two types are the shades of the dead  who, after they have departed from this life, continue to exercise  considerable influence, for good or bad, over the living.    We have still to mention a powerful class of supernatural beings who, in  strength and importance, are removed only a little from the Creator.  These are the patron spirits.    Guarding the warriors are two powerful beings, Mandarangan and his wife,  Darago, who are popularly supposed to make their home in the crater of  the volcano. They bring success in battle and give to the victors loot  and slaves. In return for these favors they demand, at certain times,  the sacrifice of a slave. Dissentions[sic], disasters, and death will be  sure to visit the people should they fail to make the offering. Each  year in the month of December the people are reminded of their  obligation by the appearance in the sky of a constellation known as  _Balatik_,[9] and soon thereafter a human sacrifice doubtless takes  place in some one or more of the Bagobo settlements.    [9] Orion.    A man to come under the protection of these two deities must first have  taken at least two human lives. He is then entitled to wear a peculiar  chocolate-colored kerchief with white patterns in it. When he has killed  four he may wear blood-red trousers, and when his score has reached six  he may don a full blood-red suit and carry a sack of the same color.  Such a man is known as _magani_ and his clothing marks him as a person  of distinction and power in his village. He is one of the leaders in a  war party; he is chosen by the _datu_ to inflict the death penalty when  it has been decreed; and he is one of the assistants in the yearly  sacrifice. It is not necessary that those he kills, in order to gain the  right to wear a red suit, be warriors. On the contrary he may kill women  and children from ambush and still receive credit for the achievement,  provided his victims are from a hostile village. He may count those of  his townspeople whom he has killed in fair fight, and the murder of an  unfaithful wife and her admirer is credited to him as a meritorious  deed.    The workers in iron and brass, the weavers of hemp cloth, and the  mediums or shamans--known as _mabalian_--are under the protection of  special deities for whom they make ceremonies at certain times of the  year.    The _mabalian_ just mentioned are people--generally women past middle  life--who, through sufficient knowledge of the spirits and their desires,  are able to converse with them, and to make ceremonies and offerings  which will attract their attention, secure their good will, or appease  their wrath. They may have a crude knowledge of medicine plants, and, in  some cases, act as exorcists. The ceremonies which art performed at the  critical periods of life are conducted by these _mabalian_, and they  also direct the offerings associated with planting and harvesting. They  are generally the ones who erect the little shrines seen along the  trails or in the forests, and it is they who put offerings in the  \"spirit boxes\" in the houses. Although they, better than all others,  know how to read the signs and warnings sent by the spirits, yet, all of  the people know the meaning of certain omens sent through the medium of  birds and the like. The call of the _limokon_[10] is recognized as an  encouragement or a warning and its message will be heeded without fail.  In brief, every natural phenomenon and every living thing is caused by  or is subject to the will of unseen beings, who in turn can be  influenced by the acts of individuals. As a result everything of  importance is undertaken with reference to these superior powers.    [10] A dove (_Calcophops indica_). Similar beliefs held by the Tagalog  were mentioned by Juan de Plasencia in 1589. See BLAIR and ROBERTSON,  Vol. VII, p. 189.    DWELLINGS--HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS.    The houses found in the coast villages line well marked streets and  differ in few respects from those built by the Christianized natives  throughout the Islands. Even in the more isolated districts the effect  of this outside influence is marked. However, we can state with  confidence that village life is a new idea to the Bagobo. He has, from  time immemorial, built his home near to his fields, and there he and his  family reside, except during festivals or when extreme danger threatens.  At such times all go to the house of the local ruler and there unite in  the festivities or the common defense.    The smaller dwellings have but one room, the floor of which is raised  several feet above the ground and supported by many piles. A part of the  latter extend five of[sic] six feet above the floor and form supports  for the side and cross-beams. From the center of the room lighter poles  project eight or ten feet above the cross-beams and form the main  supports for the ridge timber. From beams at the end and sides of the  room similar pieces run to this central ridge; below this they are  joined together, at intervals, by means of horizontal poles and  cross-beams. To this framework are lashed strips of _palma brava_,  supports for a covering of closely laid _runo_, on which rests the final  topping of flattened bamboo. The ridge pole is always at a sufficient  height above the floor to give the roof a steep peak, and is of such  length that, at the top, the side roof overhangs the ends. The roof  generally rises in two pitches and always extends past the sides of the  room.    In house building, the roof, which is made first, is raised to the  desired height, thus serving as a shelter for the workers until the  structure is complete (Plate XIII). Resting on the cross-beams, just  below the rafters, a number of loose boards are laid to form a sort of  attic or storage room where all unused articles, and odds and ends are  allowed to accumulate.    The sides of the room, which are of flattened bamboo, are about six feet  in height, and extend only to within a foot of the roof. In the walls  small peep holes are cut so that the inhabitants can look outside  without being seen (Plate XIV).    The flooring, which is generally made of strips of _palma brava_, is in  two levels, forming a narrow elevated platform at one end of the room on  which a part of the family sleep.    The furniture of this house is very scanty. Near to the door is the  \"stove\" (Fig. 8)--a bed of ashes in which three stones are sunk to form a  support for the pots and jars and nearby stand a few native jars and  sections of bamboo filled with water. On a hanger above the fire may be  found articles of food, seeds, and the like, which need protection from  flies and insects. Against the wall is a bamboo rack (Fig. 9), filled  with Chinese plates, or half cocoanut shells which serve as dishes. Near  to the stove is a rice mortar standing on its own wooden pedestal which  reaches to the ground (Fig. 10).    FIG. 8. THE \"STOVE.\"    FIG. 9. BAMBOO PLATE RACK.    FIG. 10A. RICE MORTAR.

A child's cradle, made of a blanket suspended hammock-like between the  wall and a beam support, will probably be found. A few boxes and jars,  usually of Chinese make, and always a copper gong or two are regular  furnishings, while to these can be added a miscellany of clothing,  looms, spears, shields, meat blocks, spoons (Fig. 11), and the like.
