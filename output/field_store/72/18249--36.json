Because I went to the drawer this morning  before going to parade, and I saw some of Mrs. Clinton's baby's  night-gowns in it. Yes, I see they are all in the wash-tub now; but they  were there this morning, and when I heard you say you had put the child  into one of our baby's night-gowns because it had no clean ones of its  own, I knew that you were lying, and that you had done this on purpose.\"    The woman was silent a moment and then burst out, \"You are a greater  fool than ever I thought you! I did tell a lie when I gave that reason  for putting the child into our baby's gown. When I took the two clean  ones out of the drawer I did not notice until I put them on that they  were both ours, and then I thought it was not worth while changing again  just as the child had got quiet and comfortable. Then when I found what  had happened in the morning, I had to make some excuse or other, and  that occurred to me as the best. When I came back I did put them all  into the wash-tub, clean and dirty, in case any one should come here to  see about them. What harm was there in that, I should like to know?\"    \"You have acknowledged you have told one lie over it; after that you may  say what you like, but you need not expect me to believe you.\"    \"Well, why don't you go at once and tell them that you believe that I  changed the children on purpose?\"    \"Because in the first place I cannot prove it, and because in the second  case you are my wife, Jane. I took you for better or worse, and whatever  you have done it is not for me to round on you. Anyhow, I will do all I  can to set this matter straight, and the only way that I see it can be  set straight is by doing as Captain Clinton says--by letting him have  the two children until they grow up, and then see which of the two is  like them and which is like us. What do you want done? I suppose you  don't want to have the care of them both. I suppose you don't want to  get paid for letting them keep them both, and to have every man and  woman in the regiment asking the question, Who sold their child? What is  it you do want?\"    \"I want to go as their nurse.\"    \"Well, then, you cannot do it. It is evident that Mrs. Clinton hates the  sight of you, and no wonder; and she won't have you at any price. You  had best be contented with what you have got.\"    \"What have I got?\" she asked sullenly.    \"Well, you have got the trouble of the child off your hands, you have  got the knowledge that it will be well taken care of and provided for  and made a gentleman of. That ought to be a satisfaction to you anyhow.\"    \"What is that when we might make a nice little fortune out of it?\"    \"I can see no way of making a fortune,\" he said, \"unless you do know  which is which, and offer to tell them if they will pay you for it. In  which case, instead of making a fortune you would be likely to find  yourself inside a prison for years--and serve you right.\"    The woman was silent for some time, then she said, \"Very well, then, I  will agree to their terms; but mind you, I will make money out of it  yet.\" And so Sergeant Humphreys went across to Captain Clinton's  bungalow and told him that his wife agreed to give up both children.    \"It is by far the best thing for the little chap whichever he may be,  and you will be able to do a deal more for him than I ever could. My  wife did not quite see the matter at first, but she has come round to my  way of thinking. No, sir, we do not want to be paid,\" as Captain Clinton  was about to speak; \"as long as I am fit for service we want nothing.  Some day, perhaps, when I get past service I may ask you to give me a  job as a lodge-keeper or some such post, where I can earn my living.\"    And so the matter was settled. One of the other officers' wives had  already lent her ayah to take care of the children until one could be  found for them.    The ready manner in which Sergeant Humphreys had done the only thing in  his power to obviate the effects of his wife's carelessness restored him  at once to the good opinion of his fellow sergeants and the men, as it  was generally allowed that he had done the right thing, and that no one  could do more. Opinion, however, was less favourable as to his wife. It  was soon evident to all who lived in the non-commissioned officers'  quarters that things were not going on well between Sergeant Humphreys  and his wife. There were frequent and violent quarrels. The sergeant was  often down at the canteen drinking more than was good for him.    One day Captain Clinton sent for him. \"Sergeant, I am sorry to say that  I hear from the sergeant-major that you were drunk last night, and that  you have several times been the worse for liquor. It is not a formal  complaint, but I thought it better to talk to you. You have always been  a very steady man, and I should be sorry in the extreme if any thing  should happen which would cause you to be brought before the colonel. I  have no doubt this affair has troubled you greatly, and that it is  entirely owing to that that you have become unsettled. Try to pull  yourself round, man. You know that nobody attributes the slightest  shadow of blame to you in the matter.\"    \"Thank you, sir. I was coming to see you if you hadn't sent for me, to  say that I wished to give up my stripes and return to the ranks. I know  I shall be degraded if I don't do it of my own free-will, and I would  rather go down than be sent down.\"    \"But what will your wife do? It would be a great change to her,  Humphreys.\"    \"My wife has made up her mind to go home, sir, and I think it is the  best thing she can do. She will never be comfortable in the regiment,  and to say the truth we are not comfortable together. She says that she  has friends in England she will go and stay with, and I think it is best  to let her go. I would rather cut my hand off than ask for any thing for  myself, but as I am sure that it is for the best that she should go, and  as I don't hear of any invalids or women going home at present, I should  be very much obliged if you would lend me twenty pounds. I have got  thirty laid by, and fifty will be enough to send her across by rail to  Bombay, pay her passage home, and leave her twenty pounds in hand when  she gets there. I will pay it off so much a month.\"    \"You are welcome to twenty pounds without any talk of repayment,  Humphreys. But I wouldn't take any hasty step if I were you. If your  wife and you have had a quarrel she may change her mind in a day or two,  and think better of it.\"    \"No, sir; I think we are pretty well agreed on the point that she had  best go home. People make mistakes sometimes, and I think we both made a  mistake when we got married. Anyhow, we have both agreed that it is  best to part for a time.\"    Accordingly three or four days later Mrs. Humphreys left Agra for  Bombay, and was seen no more in the regiment. Sergeant Humphreys gave up  his stripes and returned to the ranks, and for two years remained there.  After his wife had left him he gradually gave up the habit into which he  had fallen, and at the end of the two years again became a  non-commissioned officer. He was never heard to speak of his wife after  she left him, nor so far as his comrades knew did he ever receive a  letter from her. Soon after he had again got his stripes the regiment  returned to England, and a month later Captain Clinton sent in his  papers and retired from the service.          CHAPTER II.    AT CHELTENHAM.      \"Everything packed and ready, boys?\"    \"Yes, father, I think so.\"    \"The dog-cart will be at the door at eleven. Be sure and be ready in  time. It won't do to miss your train, you know. Well, you have had a  pleasant holiday this time, haven't you?\"    \"Very,\" both boys replied together.    \"It has been awfully jolly,\" one went on, \"and that trip in Brittany was  certainly the best thing we have done, though we have always enjoyed our  holidays. It is ever so much nicer going to out-of-the-way sort of  places, and stopping at jolly little inns without any crowd and fuss,  than being in those great Swiss hotels as we were last year, where every  one was English, and one had to be in at regular times and almost fight  to get something to eat. I hope next year you will be able to take us to  Norway, as you were saying yesterday. I should think it would be just  the same sort of thing as Brittany, only, of course, different sort of  scenery, and different language and different people. Madge, you will  have to set to and get up Norse to act as our interpreter.\"    \"You are very lazy boys. I had to do all the talking in Brittany. You  are supposed to have learnt French longer than I have.\"    \"Oh, yes; supposed. Nobody cares about their French lessons. They make  no difference in your place in the school, and so no one takes the  trouble to grind at them. Well, come along, let us take a turn round the  place for an hour before we start.\" And the two boys and Madge, who was  a year their junior, went out through the French window into the garden.    Captain Clinton walked to the window and looked after them. They were  lads any father might be proud of, straight, well-built, handsome  English lads of about sixteen. Rupert was somewhat taller than Edgar,  while the latter had slightly the advantage in breadth of shoulders.  Beyond the fact that both had brown hair and gray eyes there was no  marked likeness between them, and their school-fellows often wondered  that there should not be more similarity between twins. Both had  pleasant open faces, and they were equally popular among their  school-fellows. As to which was the cleverest, there were no means of  ascertaining; for although both were at Cheltenham together, one was on  the modern and the other on the classical side,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#4)"],[1,"both are therefore  probably the more concerned to maintain the social position to which  they lay claim. But Kewats, Rawats, Telis and other castes eat cooked  food from Agharias, and the caste therefore is admitted to a fairly  high rank in the Uriya country. The Agharias do not drink liquor or  eat any food which a Rajput would refuse.        5. Occupation.      As cultivators they are considered to be proficient. In the census of  1901 nearly a quarter of the whole caste were shown as malguzars or  village proprietors and lessees. They wear a coarse cloth of homespun  yarn which they get woven for them by Gandas; probably in consequence  of this the Agharias do not consider the touch of the Ganda to pollute  them, as other castes do. They will not grow turmeric, onions, garlic,  _san_-hemp or tomatoes, nor will they rear tasar silk-cocoons. Colonel  Dalton says that their women do no outdoor work, and this is true in  the Central Provinces as regards the better classes, but poor women  work in the fields.        Aghori        1. General accounts of the caste.      _Aghori, Aghorpanthi._ [7]--The most disreputable class of Saiva  mendicants who feed on human corpses and excrement, and in past  times practised cannibalism. The sect is apparently an ancient one, a  supposed reference to it being contained in the Sanskrit drama _Malati  Madhava_, the hero of which rescues his mistress from being offered  as a sacrifice by one named Aghori Ghanta. [8] According to Lassen,  quoted by Sir H. Risley, the Aghoris of the present day are closely  connected with the Kapalika sect of the Middle Ages, who wore crowns  and necklaces of skulls and offered human sacrifices to Chamunda,  a form of Devi. The Aghoris now represent their filthy habits as  merely giving practical expression to the abstract doctrine that the  whole universe is full of Brahma, and consequently that one thing is  as pure as another. By eating the most horrible food they utterly  subdue their natural appetites, and hence acquire great power over  themselves and over the forces of nature. It is believed that an  Aghori can at will assume the shapes of a bird, an animal or a fish,  and that he can bring back to life a corpse of which he has eaten a  part. The principal resort of the Aghoris appears to be at Benares and  at Girnar near Mount Abu, and they wander about the country as solitary  mendicants. A few reside in Saugor, and they are occasionally met with  in other places. They are much feared and disliked by the people owing  to their practice of extorting alms by the threat to carry out their  horrible practices before the eyes of their victims, and by throwing  filth into their houses. Similarly they gash and cut their limbs so  that the crime of blood may rest on those who refuse to give. \"For the  most part,\" Mr. Barrow states, [9] \"the Aghorpanthis lead a wandering  life, are without homes, and prefer to dwell in holes, clefts of rocks  and burning-_ghats_. They do not cook, but eat the fragments given  them in charity as received, which they put as far as may be into the  cavity of the skull used as a begging-bowl. The bodies of _chelas_  (disciples) who die in Benares are thrown into the Ganges, but the  dead who die well off are placed in coffins. As a rule, Aghoris do not  care what becomes of their bodies, but when buried they are placed in  the grave sitting cross-legged. The Aghori _gurus_ keep dogs, which  may be of any colour, and are said to be maintained for purposes of  protection. The dogs are not all pariahs of the streets, although some  _gurus_ are followed by three or four when on pilgrimage. Occasionally  the dogs seem to be regarded with real affection by their strange  masters. The Aghori is believed to hold converse with all the evil  spirits frequenting the burning-_ghats_, and funeral parties must  be very badly off who refuse to pay him something. In former days he  claimed five pieces of wood at each funeral in Benares; but the Doms  interfere with his perquisites, and in some cases only let him carry  off the remains of the unburned wood from each pyre. When angered  and excited, Aghoris invoke Kali and threaten to spread devastation  around them. Even among the educated classes, who should know better,  they are dreaded, and as an instance of the terror which they create  among the ignorant, it may be mentioned that in the Lucknow District  it is believed that if alms are refused them the Aghoris will cause  those who refuse to be attacked with fever.    \"On the other hand, their good offices may secure benefits, as in the  case of a zamindar of Muzaffarnagar, who at Allahabad refused to eat a  piece of human flesh offered to him by an Aghori; the latter thereupon  threw the flesh at the zamindar's head, on which it stuck. The zamindar  afterwards became so exceedingly wealthy that he had difficulty in  storing his wealth.\"        2. Instances of cannibalism.      In former times it is believed that the Aghoris used to kidnap  strangers, sacrifice them to the goddess and eat the bodies, and  Mr. Barrow relates the following incident of the murder of a boy: [10]  \"Another horrible case, unconnected with magic and apparently arising  from mere blood-thirst, occurred at Neirad in June 1878. An Aghori  mendicant of Dwarka staying at the temple of Sitaram Laldas seized a  boy of twelve, named Shankar Ramdas, who was playing with two other  boys, threw him down on the _oatla_ of the temple, ripped open his  abdomen, tore out part of his entrails, and, according to the poor  little victim's dying declaration, began to eat them. The other boys  having raised an alarm, the monster was seized. When interrogated by  the magistrate as to whether he had committed the crime in order to  perform Aghorbidya, the prisoner said that as the boy was Bhakshan  he had eaten his flesh. He added that if he had not been interrupted  he would have eaten all the entrails. He was convicted, but only  sentenced to transportation for life. The High Court, however,  altered the sentence and ordered the prisoner to be hanged.\"    The following instance, quoted by Mr. Barrow from Rewah, shows how an  Aghori was hoist with his own petard: \"Some years ago, when Maharaja  Bishnath Singh was Chief of Rewah, a man of the Aghori caste went  to Rewah and sat _dharna_ on the steps of the palace; having made  ineffectual demands for alms, he requested to be supplied with human  flesh, and for five days abstained from food. The Maharaja was much  troubled, and at last, in order to get rid of his unwelcome visitor,  sent for Ghansiam Das, another Aghori, a Fakir, who had for some  years lived in Rewah. Ghansiam Das went up to the other Aghori and  asked him if it was true that he had asked to be supplied with human  flesh. On receiving a reply in the affirmative, Ghansiam Das said:  'Very well, I too am extremely partial to this form of food; here is  my hand, eat it and I will eat you'; and at the same time he seized  hold of the other's hand and began to gnaw at it. The Aghori on this  became much alarmed and begged to be excused. He shortly afterwards  left Rewah and was not heard of again, while Ghansiam Das was rewarded  for his services.\"    The following recent instance of an Aghori devouring human corpses  is reported from the Punjab: [11] \"The loathsome story of a human  ghoul from Patiala shows that the influence of the Aghorpanthi has  not yet completely died out in this country. It is said that for some  time past human graves have been found robbed of their contents, and  the mystery could not be solved until the other day, when the police  succeeded in arresting a man in the act of desecrating a child's grave,  some forty miles distant from the capital (Patiala). The ghoul not only  did not conceal the undevoured portion of the corpse he had with him,  but told his captors the whole story of his gruesome career. He is  a low-caste Hindu named Ram Nath, and is, according to a gentleman  who saw him, 'a singularly mild and respectful-looking man, instead  of a red-eyed and ravenous savage,' as he had expected to find him  from the accounts of his disgusting propensities. He became an orphan  at five and fell into the hands of two Sadhus of his own caste, who  were evidently Aghorpanthis. They taught him to eat human flesh,  which formed the staple of their food. The meat was procured from  the graves in the villages they passed through. When Ram Nath was  thoroughly educated in this rank the Sadhus deserted him. Since then  he had been living on human carrion only, roaming about the country  like a hungry vulture. He cannot eat cooked food, and therefore gets  two seers of raw meat from the State every day. It is also reported  that the Maharaja has now prohibited his being given anything but  cooked food with a view to reforming him.\"    Sir J. B. Fuller relates the following incident of the employment  of an Aghori as a servant: [12] \"There are actually ten thousand  persons who at census time classed themselves as Aghoris. All of them  do not practise cannibalism and some of them attempt to rise in the  world. One of them secured service as a cook with a British officer  of my acquaintance. My friend was in camp in the jungle with his  wife and children, when his other servants came to him in a body and  refused to remain in service unless the cook was dismissed, since they  had discovered, they declared, that during the night-time he visited  cemeteries and dug up the bodies of freshly buried children. The cook  was absent, but they pointed to a box of his that emitted a sickening  smell. The man was incontinently expelled, but for long afterwards the  family were haunted by reminiscences of the curries they had eaten.\"              Ahir        List of Paragraphs          1. _General notice._      2. _Former dominance of the Abhiras._      3. _Ahir dialects._      4. _The Yadavas and Krishna._      5. _The modern Ahirs an occupational"]]]
