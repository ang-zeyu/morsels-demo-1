I remember that another little family--there were three--were  discovered by us in the same happy state as ourselves, and like the dogs  in the fable, who, receiving care at the hands of a kind man, sent their  friends to him for help, we sent them to our helper.    I remember seeing night come out of that mist, and bringing more trains  and people and noise than the whole day (we still remained at the  depot), till I felt sick and dizzy. I remember wondering what kind of a  night it was, but not knowing how to find out, as if I had no senses. I  remember that somebody said we were obliged to remain in Keebart that  night and that we set out to find lodgings; that the most important  things I saw on the way were the two largest dolls I had ever seen,  carried by two pretty little girls, and a big, handsome father; and a  great deal of gravel in the streets, and boards for the crossings. I  remember that we found a little room (we had to go up four steps first)  that we could have for seventy-five copecks, with our tea paid for in  that sum. I remember, through that mist, how I wondered what I was  sleeping on that night, as I wondered about the weather; that we really  woke up in the morning (I was so glad to rest I had believed we should  never be disturbed again) and washed, and dressed and breakfasted and  went to the depot again, to be always on hand. I remember that mamma and  the father of the little family went at once to the only good man on  earth (I thought so) and that the party of three were soon gone, by the  help of some agent that was slower, for good reasons, in helping us.    I remember that mamma came to us soon after and said that Herr  Schidorsky had told her to ask the Postmeister--some high official  there--for a pass to Eidtkunen; and there she should speak herself to  our protector's older brother who could help us by means of his great  power among the officers of high rank; that she returned in a few hours  and told us the two brothers were equal in kindness, for the older one,  too, said he would not wait to be asked to do his best for us. I  remember that another day--so-o-o long--passed behind the mist, and we  were still in that dreadful, noisy, tiresome depot, with no change, till  we went to spend the night at Herr Schidorsky's, because they wouldn't  let us go anywhere else. On the way there, I remember, I saw something  marvellous--queer little wooden sticks stuck on the lines where clothes  hung for some purpose. (I didn't think it was for drying, because you  know I always saw things hung up on fences and gates for such purposes.  The queer things turned out to be clothes-pins). And, I remember, I  noticed many other things of equal importance to our affairs, till we  came to the little house in the garden. Here we were received, I  remember with much kindness and hospitality. We had a fire made for us,  food and drink brought in, and a servant was always inquiring whether  anything more could be done for our comfort.    I remember, still through that misty veil, what a pleasant evening we  passed, talking over what had so far happened, and wondering what would  come. I must have talked like one lost in a thick fog, groping  carefully. But, had I been shut up, mentally, in a tower nothing else  could pierce, the sense of gratitude that naturally sprung from the  kindness that surrounded us, must have, would have found a passage for  itself to the deepest cavities of the heart. Yes, though all my senses  were dulled by what had passed over us so lately, I was yet aware of the  deepest sense of thankfulness one can ever feel. I was aware of  something like the sweet presence of angels in the persons of good  Schidorsky and his family. Oh, that some knowledge of that gratitude  might reach those for whom we felt it so keenly! We all felt it. But the  deepest emotions are so hard to express. I thought of this as I lay  awake a little while, and said to myself, thinking of our benefactor,  that he was a Jew, a true \"Son of Mercy.\" And I slept with that thought.  And this is the last I remember seeing and feeling behind that mist of  lazy inactivity.    The next morning, I woke not only from the night's sleep, but from my  waking dreaminess. All the vapors dispersed as I went into the pretty  flower garden where the others were already at play, and by the time we  had finished a good breakfast, served by a dear servant girl, I felt  quite myself again.    Of course, mamma hastened to Herr Schidorsky as soon as she could, and  he sent her to the Postmeister again, to ask him to return the part of  our passports that had been torn out, and without which we could not go  on. He said he would return them as soon as he received word from  Eidtkunen. So we could only wait and hope. At last it came and so  suddenly that we ran off to the depot with hardly a hat on all our  heads, or a coat on our backs, with two men running behind with our  things, making it a very ridiculous sight. We have often laughed over it  since.    Of course, in such a confusion we could not say even one word of  farewell or thanks to our deliverers. But, turning to see that we were  all there, I saw them standing in the gate, crying that all was well  now, and wishing us many pleasant things, and looking as if they had  been receiving all the blessings instead of us.    I have often thought they must have purposely arranged it that we should  have to leave in a hurry, because they wouldn't stand any expression of  gratefulness.    Well, we just reached our car in time to see our baggage brought from  the office and ourselves inside, when the last bell rang. Then, before  we could get breath enough to utter more than faint gasps of delight, we  were again in Eidtkunen.    The gendarmes came to question us again, but when mother said that we  were going to Herr Schidorsky of Eidtkunen, as she had been told to  say, we were allowed to leave the train. I really thought we were to be  the visitors of the elder Schidorsky, but it turned out to be only an  understanding between him and the officers that those claiming to be on  their way to him were not to be troubled.    At any rate, we had now really crossed the forbidden boundary--we were  in Germany.    There was a terrible confusion in the baggage-room where we were  directed to go. Boxes, baskets, bags, valises, and great, shapeless  things belonging to no particular class were thrown about by porters and  other men, who sorted them and put tickets on all but those containing  provisions, while others were opened and examined in haste. At last our  turn came, and our things, along with those of all other American-bound  travellers, were taken away to be steamed and smoked and other such  processes gone through. We were told to wait till notice should be given  us of something else to be done. Our train would not depart till nine in  the evening.    As usual, I noticed all the little particulars of the waiting room. What  else could I do with so much time and not even a book to read? I could  describe it exactly--the large, square room, painted walls, long tables  with fruits and drinks of all kinds covering them, the white chairs,  carved settees, beautiful china and cut glass showing through the glass  doors of the dressers, and the nickel samovar, which attracted my  attention because I had never seen any but copper or brass ones. The  best and the worst of everything there was a large case full of books.  It was the best, because they were \"books\" and all could use them; the  worst, because they were all German, and my studies in the railway depot  of Keebart had not taught me so much that I should be able to read books  in German. It was very hard to see people get those books and enjoy them  while I couldn't. It was impossible to be content with other people's  pleasure, and I wasn't.    When I had almost finished counting the books, I noticed that mamma and  the others had made friends with a family of travellers like ourselves.  Frau Gittleman and her five children made very interesting companions  for the rest of the day, and they seemed to think that Frau Antin and  the four younger Antins were just as interesting; perhaps excepting, in  their minds, one of them who must have appeared rather uninteresting  from a habit she had of looking about as if always expecting to make  discoveries.    But she was interested, if not interesting, enough when the oldest of  the young Gittlemans, who was a young gentleman of seventeen, produced  some books which she could read. Then all had a merry time together,  reading, talking, telling the various adventures of the journey, and  walking, as far as we were allowed, up and down the long platform  outside, till we were called to go and see, if we wanted to see, how our  things were being made fit for further travel. It was interesting to see  how they managed to have anything left to return to us, after all the  processes of airing and smoking and steaming and other assaults on  supposed germs of the dreaded cholera had been done with, the pillows,  even, being ripped open to be steamed! All this was interesting, but we  were rather disagreeably surprised when a bill for these unasked-for  services had to be paid.    The Gittlemans, we found, were to keep us company for some time. At the  expected hour we all tried to find room in a car indicated by the  conductor. We tried, but could only find enough space on the floor for  our baggage, on which we made believe sitting comfortably. For now we  were obliged to exchange the comparative comforts of a third class  passenger train for the certain discomforts of a fourth class one. There  were only four narrow benches in the whole car, and about twice as many  people were already seated on these as they were probably supposed to  accommodate. All other space, to the last inch, was crowded by  passengers or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#4)"],[1,"look out upon them from  Slanes Castle.    When we were about to take our leave, our departure was prohibited by the  countess till we should have seen two places upon the coast, which she  rightly considered as worthy of curiosity, Dun Buy, and the Buller of  Buchan, to which Mr. Boyd very kindly conducted us.    Dun Buy, which in Erse is said to signify the Yellow Rock, is a double  protuberance of stone, open to the main sea on one side, and parted from  the land by a very narrow channel on the other.  It has its name and its  colour from the dung of innumerable sea-fowls, which in the Spring chuse  this place as convenient for incubation, and have their eggs and their  young taken in great abundance.  One of the birds that frequent this rock  has, as we were told, its body not larger than a duck's, and yet lays  eggs as large as those of a goose.  This bird is by the inhabitants named  a Coot.  That which is called Coot in England, is here a Cooter.    Upon these rocks there was nothing that could long detain attention, and  we soon turned our eyes to the Buller, or Bouilloir of Buchan, which no  man can see with indifference, who has either sense of danger or delight  in rarity.  It is a rock perpendicularly tubulated, united on one side  with a high shore, and on the other rising steep to a great height, above  the main sea.  The top is open, from which may be seen a dark gulf of  water which flows into the cavity, through a breach made in the lower  part of the inclosing rock.  It has the appearance of a vast well  bordered with a wall.  The edge of the Buller is not wide, and to those  that walk round, appears very narrow.  He that ventures to look downward  sees, that if his foot should slip, he must fall from his dreadful  elevation upon stones on one side, or into water on the other.  We  however went round, and were glad when the circuit was completed.    When we came down to the sea, we saw some boats, and rowers, and resolved  to explore the Buller at the bottom.  We entered the arch, which the  water had made, and found ourselves in a place, which, though we could  not think ourselves in danger, we could scarcely survey without some  recoil of the mind.  The bason in which we floated was nearly circular,  perhaps thirty yards in diameter.  We were inclosed by a natural wall,  rising steep on every side to a height which produced the idea of  insurmountable confinement.  The interception of all lateral light caused  a dismal gloom.  Round us was a perpendicular rock, above us the distant  sky, and below an unknown profundity of water.  If I had any malice  against a walking spirit, instead of laying him in the Red-sea, I would  condemn him to reside in the Buller of Buchan.    But terrour without danger is only one of the sports of fancy, a  voluntary agitation of the mind that is permitted no longer than it  pleases.  We were soon at leisure to examine the place with minute  inspection, and found many cavities which, as the waterman told us, went  backward to a depth which they had never explored.  Their extent we had  not time to try; they are said to serve different purposes.  Ladies come  hither sometimes in the summer with collations, and smugglers make them  storehouses for clandestine merchandise.  It is hardly to be doubted but  the pirates of ancient times often used them as magazines of arms, or  repositories of plunder.    To the little vessels used by the northern rovers, the Buller may have  served as a shelter from storms, and perhaps as a retreat from enemies;  the entrance might have been stopped, or guarded with little difficulty,  and though the vessels that were stationed within would have been  battered with stones showered on them from above, yet the crews would  have lain safe in the caverns.    Next morning we continued our journey, pleased with our reception at  Slanes Castle, of which we had now leisure to recount the grandeur and  the elegance; for our way afforded us few topics of conversation.  The  ground was neither uncultivated nor unfruitful; but it was still all  arable.  Of flocks or herds there was no appearance.  I had now travelled  two hundred miles in Scotland, and seen only one tree not younger than  myself.          BAMFF      We dined this day at the house of Mr. Frazer of Streichton, who shewed us  in his grounds some stones yet standing of a druidical circle, and what I  began to think more worthy of notice, some forest trees of full growth.    At night we came to Bamff, where I remember nothing that particularly  claimed my attention.  The ancient towns of Scotland have generally an  appearance unusual to Englishmen.  The houses, whether great or small,  are for the most part built of stones.  Their ends are now and then next  the streets, and the entrance into them is very often by a flight of  steps, which reaches up to the second story, the floor which is level  with the ground being entered only by stairs descending within the house.    The art of joining squares of glass with lead is little used in Scotland,  and in some places is totally forgotten.  The frames of their windows are  all of wood.  They are more frugal of their glass than the English, and  will often, in houses not otherwise mean, compose a square of two pieces,  not joining like cracked glass, but with one edge laid perhaps half an  inch over the other.  Their windows do not move upon hinges, but are  pushed up and drawn down in grooves, yet they are seldom accommodated  with weights and pullies.  He that would have his window open must hold  it with his hand, unless what may be sometimes found among good  contrivers, there be a nail which he may stick into a hole, to keep it  from falling.    What cannot be done without some uncommon trouble or particular  expedient, will not often be done at all.  The incommodiousness of the  Scotch windows keeps them very closely shut.  The necessity of  ventilating human habitations has not yet been found by our northern  neighbours; and even in houses well built and elegantly furnished, a  stranger may be sometimes forgiven, if he allows himself to wish for  fresher air.    These diminutive observations seem to take away something from the  dignity of writing, and therefore are never communicated but with  hesitation, and a little fear of abasement and contempt.  But it must be  remembered, that life consists not of a series of illustrious actions, or  elegant enjoyments; the greater part of our time passes in compliance  with necessities, in the performance of daily duties, in the removal of  small inconveniences, in the procurement of petty pleasures; and we are  well or ill at ease, as the main stream of life glides on smoothly, or is  ruffled by small obstacles and frequent interruption.  The true state of  every nation is the state of common life.  The manners of a people are  not to be found in the schools of learning, or the palaces of greatness,  where the national character is obscured or obliterated by travel or  instruction, by philosophy or vanity; nor is public happiness to be  estimated by the assemblies of the gay, or the banquets of the rich.  The  great mass of nations is neither rich nor gay: they whose aggregate  constitutes the people, are found in the streets, and the villages, in  the shops and farms; and from them collectively considered, must the  measure of general prosperity be taken.  As they approach to delicacy a  nation is refined, as their conveniences are multiplied, a nation, at  least a commercial nation, must be denominated wealthy.          ELGIN      Finding nothing to detain us at Bamff, we set out in the morning, and  having breakfasted at Cullen, about noon came to Elgin, where in the inn,  that we supposed the best, a dinner was set before us, which we could not  eat.  This was the first time, and except one, the last, that I found any  reason to complain of a Scotish table; and such disappointments, I  suppose, must be expected in every country, where there is no great  frequency of travellers.    The ruins of the cathedral of Elgin afforded us another proof of the  waste of reformation.  There is enough yet remaining to shew, that it was  once magnificent.  Its whole plot is easily traced.  On the north side of  the choir, the chapter-house, which is roofed with an arch of stone,  remains entire; and on the south side, another mass of building, which we  could not enter, is preserved by the care of the family of Gordon; but  the body of the church is a mass of fragments.    A paper was here put into our hands, which deduced from sufficient  authorities the history of this venerable ruin.  The church of Elgin had,  in the intestine tumults of the barbarous ages, been laid waste by the  irruption of a highland chief, whom the bishop had offended; but it was  gradually restored to the state, of which the traces may be now  discerned, and was at last not destroyed by the tumultuous violence of  Knox, but more shamefully suffered to dilapidate by deliberate robbery  and frigid indifference.  There is still extant, in the books of the  council, an order, of which I cannot remember the date, but which was  doubtless issued after the Reformation, directing that the lead, which  covers the two cathedrals of Elgin and Aberdeen, shall be taken away, and  converted into money for the support of the army.  A Scotch army was in  those times very cheaply kept; yet the lead of two churches must have  born so small a proportion to any military expence, that it is hard not  to believe the reason alleged to be merely popular, and the money  intended for some private purse.  The order however was obeyed; the two  churches were stripped, and the lead was shipped to be sold in Holland.  I  hope every reader will rejoice that this cargo of sacrilege was lost at  sea.    Let us not however make too much haste to despise our neighbours.  Our  own cathedrals are mouldering by unregarded dilapidation.  It seems to be"]]]
