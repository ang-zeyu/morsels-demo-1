He touched  their heads one at a time, and feeling the crowns of gold, said to  himself, \"Oh, oh! I had like to have made such a mistake. I must have  drunk too much wine last night.\"    He went next to the bed that his own little Ogresses were in, and when  he felt the nightcaps, he said, \"Ah! here you are, my lads:\" and so in  a moment he cut the throats of all his daughters.    He was very much pleased when he had done this, and then went back to  his own bed. As soon as Hop-o'-my-thumb heard him snore, he awoke his  brothers, and told them to put on their clothes quickly, and follow  him. They stole down softly into the garden, and then jumped from the  wall into the road: they ran as fast as their legs could carry them,  but were so much afraid all the while, that they hardly knew which way  to take. When the Ogre waked in the morning, he said to his wife,  grinning, \"My dear, go and dress the young rogues I saw last night.\"    The wife was quite surprised at hearing her husband speak so kindly,  and did not dream of the real meaning of his words. She supposed he  wanted her to help them to put on their clothes; so she went upstairs,  and the first thing she saw was her seven daughters with their throats  cut and all over blood. This threw her into a fainting fit. The Ogre  was afraid his wife might be too long in doing what he had set her  about, so he went himself to help her; but he was as much shocked as  she had been at the dreadful sight of his bleeding children. \"Ah! what  have I done?\" he cried; \"but the little rascals shall pay for it, I  warrant them.\"    He first threw some water on his wife's face; and, as soon as she came  to herself, he said to her: \"Bring me quickly my seven-league boots,  that I may go and catch the little vipers.\"    The Ogre then put on these boots, and set out with all speed. He  strided over many parts of the country, and at last turned into the  very road in which the poor children were. For they had set off  towards the faggot-maker's cottage, which they had almost reached.  They watched the Ogre stepping from mountain to mountain at one step,  and crossing rivers as if they had been tiny brooks. At this  Hop-o'-my-thumb thought a little what was to be done; and spying a  hollow place under a large rock, he made his brothers get into it. He  then crept in himself, but kept his eye fixed on the Ogre, to see what  he would do next.    The Ogre found himself quite weary with the journey he had gone, for  seven-league boots are very tiresome to the person who wears them; so  he now began to think of resting, and happened to sit down on the very  rock where the poor children were hid. As he was so tired, and it was  a very hot day, he fell fast asleep, and soon began to snore so loud,  that the little fellows were terrified.    When Hop-o'-my-thumb saw this he said to his brothers, \"Courage, my  lads! never fear! you have nothing to do but to steal away and get  home while the Ogre is fast asleep, and leave me to shift for myself.\"    The brothers now were very glad to do whatever he told them, and so  they soon came to their father's house. In the mean time  Hop-o'-my-thumb went up to the Ogre softly, pulled off his  seven-league boots very gently, and put them on his own legs: for  though the boots were very large, yet being fairy-boots, they could  make themselves small enough to fit any leg they pleased.    As soon as ever Hop-o'-my-thumb had made sure of the Ogre's  seven-league boots, he went at once to the palace, and offered his  services to carry orders from the king to his army, which was a great  way off, and to bring back the quickest accounts of the battle they  were just at that time fighting with the enemy. In short, he thought  he could be of more use to the king than all his mail coaches, and so  should make his fortune in this manner. He succeeded so well, that in  a short time he made money enough to keep himself, his father, mother,  and six brothers, without the trouble of working, for the rest of  their lives. Having done this, he went back to his father's cottage,  where all the family were delighted to see him again. As the great  fame of his boots had been talked of at court in this time, the king  sent for him, and indeed employed him very often in the greatest  affairs of the state, so that he became one of the richest men in the  kingdom.    And now let us see what became of the wicked Ogre. He slept so soundly  that he never discovered the loss of his boots; but having an evil  conscience and bad dreams, he fell in his sleep from the corner of the  rock where Hop-o'-my-thumb and his brothers had left him, and bruised  himself so much from head to foot, that he could not stir: so he was  forced to stretch himself out at full length, and wait for some one to  come and help him.    Now a good many faggot-makers passed near the place where the Ogre  lay; and, when they heard him groan, they went up to ask him what was  the matter. But the Ogre had eaten such a great number of children in  his lifetime, that he had grown so very big and fat that these men  could not even have carried one of his legs; so they were forced to  leave him there. At last night came on, and then a large serpent came  out of a wood just by, and stung him, so that he died in great pain.    By and by, Hop-o'-my-thumb, who had become the king's first favourite,  heard of the Ogre's death; and the first thing he did was to tell his  majesty all that the good-natured Ogress had done to save the lives of  himself and brothers. The king was so much pleased at what he heard,  that he asked Hop-o'-my-thumb if there was any favour he could bestow  upon her? Hop-o'-my-thumb thanked the king, and desired that the  Ogress might have the noble title of Duchess of Draggletail given to  her; which was no sooner asked than granted. The Ogress then came to  court, and lived very happily for many years, enjoying the vast  fortune she had found in the Ogre's chests. As for Hop-o'-my-thumb, he  every day grew more witty and brave; till at last the king made him  the greatest lord in the kingdom, and set him over all his affairs.          CINDERELLA    OR,    The Little Glass Slipper.      There was once an honest gentle man who took for his second wife a  lady, the proudest and most disagreeable in the whole country. She had  two daughters exactly like herself in all things. He also had one  little girl, who resembled her dead mother, the best woman in all the  world. Scarcely had the second marriage taken place, than the  stepmother became jealous of the good qualities of the little girl,  who was so great a contrast to her own two daughters. She gave her all  the menial occupations of the house; compelled her to wash the floors  and staircases, to dust the bed-rooms, and clean the grates; and while  her sisters occupied carpeted chambers hung with mirrors, where they  could see themselves from head to foot, this poor little damsel was  sent to sleep in an attic, on an old straw mattress, with only one  chair and not a looking-glass in the room.    She suffered all in silence, not daring to complain to her father, who  was entirely ruled by his new wife. When her daily work was done she  used to sit down in the chimney-corner among the ashes; from which the  two sisters gave her the nick-name of _Cinderella_. But Cinderella,  however shabbily clad, was handsomer than they were with all their  fine clothes.    It happened that the king's son gave a series of balls, to which were  invited all the rank and fashion of the city, and among the rest the  two elder sisters. They were very proud and happy, and occupied their  whole time in deciding what they should wear; a source of new trouble  to Cinderella, whose duty it was to get up their fine linen and laces,  and who never could please them however much she tried. They talked of  nothing but their clothes.    \"I,\" said the elder, \"shall wear my velvet gown and my trimmings of  English lace.\"    \"And I,\" added the younger, \"will have but my ordinary silk petticoat,  but I shall adorn it with an upper skirt of flowered brocade, and  shall put on my diamond tiara, which is a great deal finer than  anything of yours.\"    Here the elder sister grew angry, and the dispute began to run so  high, that Cinderella, who was known to have excellent taste, was  called upon to decide between them. She gave them the best advice she  could, and gently and submissively offered to dress them herself, and  especially to arrange their hair, an accomplishment in which she  excelled many a noted coiffeur. The important evening came, and she  exercised all her skill to adorn the two young ladies. While she was  combing out the elder's hair, this ill-natured girl said sharply,  \"Cinderella, do you not wish you were going to the ball?\"    \"Ah, madam\" (they obliged her always to say madam), \"you are only  mocking me; it is not my fortune to have any such pleasure.\"    \"You are right; people would only laugh to see a little cinder-wench  at a ball.\"    Any other than Cinderella would have dressed the hair all awry, but  she was good, and dressed it perfectly even and smooth, and as  prettily as she could.    The sisters had scarcely eaten for two days, and had broken a dozen  stay-laces a day, in trying to make themselves slender; but to-night  they broke a dozen more, and lost their tempers over and over again  before they had completed their toilette. When at last the happy  moment arrived, Cinderella followed them to the coach; after it had  whirled them away, she sat down by the kitchen fire and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19737"],[0,"The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture, Elucidated (#4)"],[1,"y; after which the lancet arch  appears to have been generally discarded, though the other two prevailed  till a much later period.    Q. What are the different kinds of complex pointed arches?    A. Those commonly called the OGEE, or contrasted arch; and the TUDOR arch.    Q. How is the ogee, or contrasted arch, formed and described?    A. It is formed of four segments of a circle, and is described from four  centres, two placed within the arch on a level with the spring, and two  placed on the exterior of the arch, and level with the apex or point (fig.  8); each side is composed of a double curve, the lowermost convex and the  uppermost concave.    [Illustration]    Q. When was the ogee arch introduced, and how long did it prevail?    A. It was introduced early in the fourteenth century, and continued till  the close of the fifteenth century.    Q. How is the Tudor arch described?    A. From four centres; two on a level with the spring, and two at a  distance from it, and below. (fig. 9.)    Q. When was the Tudor arch introduced, and why is it so called?    A. It was introduced about the middle of the fifteenth century, or perhaps  earlier, but became most prevalent during the reigns of Henry the Seventh  and Henry the Eighth, under the Tudor dynasty, from which it derives its  name.    [Illustration]    Q. What other kinds of arches are there worthy of notice?    A. Those which are called foiled arches, as the round-headed trefoil (fig.  10), the pointed trefoil (fig. 11), and the square-headed trefoil (fig.  12). The first prevailed in the latter part of the twelfth and early part  of the thirteenth century, chiefly as a heading for niches or blank  arcades; the second, used for the same purpose, we find to have prevailed  in the thirteenth century; and the latter is found in doorways of the  thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. In all these the  exterior mouldings follow the same curvatures as the inner mouldings, and  are thus distinguishable from arches the heads of which are only foliated  within.

OF THE ANGLO-SAXON STYLE.      Q. During what period of time did this style prevail?    A. From the close of the sixth century, when the conversion of the  Anglo-Saxons commenced, to the middle of the eleventh century.    Q. Whence does this style appear to have derived its origin?    A. From the later Roman edifices; for in the most ancient of the  Anglo-Saxon remains we find an approximation, more or less, to the Roman  mode of building, with arches formed of brickwork.    Q. What is peculiar in the constructive features of Roman masonry?    A. Walls of Roman masonry in this country were chiefly constructed of  stone or flint, according to the part of the country in which the one  material or other prevailed, embedded in mortar, bonded at certain  intervals throughout with regular horizontal courses or layers of large  flat Roman bricks or tiles, which, from the inequality of thickness and  size, do not appear to have been shaped in any regular mould.    [Illustration: Portion of the Fragment of a Roman Building at Leicester.]    Q. What vestiges of Roman masonry are now existing in Britain?    A. A fragment, apparently that of a Roman temple or basilica, near the  church of St. Nicholas at Leicester, which contains horizontal courses of  brick at intervals, and arches constructed of brickwork; the curious  portion of a wall of similar construction, with remains of brick arches on  the one side, which indicate it to have formed part of a building, and not  a mere wall as it now appears, at Wroxeter, Salop; and the polygonal tower  at Dover Castle, which, notwithstanding an exterior casing of flint, and  other alterations effected in the fifteenth century, still retains many  visible features of its original construction of tufa bonded with bricks  at intervals. Roman masonry, of the mixed description of brick and stone,  regularly disposed, is found in walls at York, Lincoln, Silchester, and  elsewhere; and sometimes we meet with bricks or stone arranged  herring-bone fashion, as in the vestiges of a Roman building at Castor,  Northamptonshire, and the walls of a Roman villa discovered at Littleton,  Somersetshire.    Q. Have we any remains of the ancient British churches erected in this  country in the third, fourth, or fifth centuries?    A. None such have yet been discovered or noticed; for the ruinous  structure at Perranzabuloe in Cornwall, which some assert to have been an  ancient British church, is probably not of earlier date than the twelfth  century; and the church of St. Martin at Canterbury, built in the time of  the Romans, which Augustine found on his arrival still used for the  worship of God, was rebuilt in the thirteenth century, but, to all  appearance, with the same materials of which the original church was  constructed.    Q. Do any of our churches bear a resemblance to Roman buildings?    A. The church now in ruins within the precincts of the Castle of Dover  presents features of early work approximating Roman, as a portal and  window-arches formed of brickwork, which seem to have been copied from  those in the Roman tower near adjoining; the walls also have much of Roman  brick worked up into them, but have no such regular horizontal layers as  Roman masonry displays. The most ancient portions of this church are  attributed to belong to the middle of the seventh century. The church of  Brixworth, Northamptonshire, is perhaps the most complete specimen we have  existing of an early Anglo-Saxon church: it has had side aisles separated  from the nave by semicircular arches constructed of Roman bricks, with  wide joints; these arches spring from square and plain massive piers.  There is also fair recorded evidence to support the inference that this  church is a structure of the latter part of the seventh century. Roman  bricks are worked up in the walls, in no regular order, however, but  indiscriminately, as in the church at Dover Castle.    [Illustration: Pilaster Rib-work Arch, Brigstock Church.]    Q. What peculiarities are observable in masonry of Anglo-Saxon  construction?    A. From existing vestiges of churches of presumed Anglo-Saxon construction  it appears that the walls were chiefly formed of rubble or rag-stone,  covered on the exterior with stucco or plaster, with long and short blocks  of ashlar or hewn stone, disposed at the angles in alternate courses. We  also find, projecting a few inches from the surface of the wall, and  running up vertically, narrow ribs or square-edged strips of stone,  bearing from their position a rude similarity to pilasters; and these  strips are generally composed of long and short pieces of stone placed  alternately. A plain string course of the same description of square-edged  rib or strip-work often runs horizontally along the walls of Anglo-Saxon  remains, and the vertical ribs are sometimes set upon such as a basement,  and sometimes finish under such.    Q. What churches exhibit projecting strips of stonework thus disposed?    A. The towers of the churches of Earls Barton and Barnack,  Northamptonshire, and the tower of one of the churches at  Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, are covered with these narrow projecting  strips of stonework, in such a manner that the surface of the wall appears  divided into rudely formed panels; the like disposition of rib-work  appears, though not to so great extent, on the face of the upper part of  the tower of Stowe Church, Northamptonshire, of St. Benedict's Church,  Cambridge, on the walls of the church of Worth, in Sussex, on the upper  part of the walls of the chancel of Repton Church, Derbyshire, and on the  walls of the nave and north transept of Stanton Lacey Church, Salop.    [Illustration: Anglo-Saxon Masonry, Long and Short Work.    Burcombe, Wilts. Wittering, Northamptonshire.]    Q. Where do we meet with instances where long and short blocks of ashlar  masonry are disposed in alternate courses at the angles of walls?    A. Such occur at the angles of the chancel of North Burcombe Church,  Wiltshire; at the angles of the nave and chancel of Wittering Church,  Northamptonshire; at the angles of the towers of St. Benedict's Church,  Cambridge, of Sompting Church, Sussex, and of St. Michael's Church,  Oxford, and in other Anglo-Saxon remains. The ashlar masonry forming the  angles is not, however, invariably thus disposed.    Q. How are the doorways of this style distinguished?    A. They are either semicircular, or triangular-arched headed, but the  former are more common. In those, apparently the most ancient, the  voussoirs or arched heads are faced with large flat bricks or tiles,  closely resembling Roman work. Doorways of this description are to be met  with in the old church, Dover Castle; in the church of Brixworth,  Northamptonshire; and on the south side of Brytford Church, Wiltshire. The  doorway, however, we most frequently meet with in Anglo-Saxon remains, is  of simple yet peculiar construction, semicircular-headed, and formed  entirely of stone, without any admixture of brick; the jambs are  square-edged, and are sometimes but not always composed of two long blocks  placed upright, with a short block between them; the arched head of the  doorway is plain, and springs from square projecting impost blocks, the  under edges of which are sometimes bevelled and sometimes left square.  This doorway is contained within a kind of arch of rib-work, projecting  from the face of the wall, with strips of pilaster rib-work continued down  to the ground; sometimes this arch springs from plain block imposts, or  from strips of square-edged rib-work disposed horizontally, and the jambs  are occasionally constructed of long and short work.
