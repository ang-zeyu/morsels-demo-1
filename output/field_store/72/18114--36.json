Comrade, now that we know our destination, and have arranged our  affairs, we may converse a little about the dreadful events which  occurred yesterday. You were at Auerstadt. Do you know that at Jena we  had no knowledge whatever of the battle that was going on at Auerstadt,  and were informed of it only in the evening, after we had been  completely routed? We did not hear the reports of your guns!\"    \"So it was with us, too. At Auerstadt we did not know that a battle was  being fought at Jena; the roar of our own artillery prevented us from  hearing yours. Only when the king had sent off several orderlies to  order the Prince of Hohenlohe and General Ruechel to cover our retreat,  we learned, from the chasseur who returned first, that a battle had been  fought also at Jena, and that Hohenlohe and Ruechel were unable to afford  us any assistance. I cannot describe to you the dismay produced by this  intelligence. Every one thought only of saving himself; there was no  longer any obedience, sense of honor, or bravery. The generals were too  confused to issue orders, and the soldiers too frightened to listen to  their officers.\"    \"And the king?\"    \"The king was evidently determined to die. His face was livid, his lips  were quivering; wherever the bullets rained down most murderously,  thither he spurred his horse. He had two horses killed, but remained  uninjured. It seems Fate was too unmerciful toward him: it had decreed  that the King of Prussia should not die, but learn in the stern school  of suffering and experience what Prussia needs.\"    \"And the Duke of Brunswick--the commander-in-chief?\"    \"Ah, you do not yet know the terrible fate that befell him? A bullet  passed through his head; it entered on the right side, and came out on  the left. This happened in the early part of the battle; the duke was  brought back to Auerstadt in a fainting condition; his wound was dressed  there, and then he was carried by some soldiers to Blankenburg.\"    \"The duke is not yet dead, then, notwithstanding this terrible wound?\"    \"No,\" said Schill, solemnly, \"God would not let him die without reaping  the fruit of what he had sown. For his mental blindness God punished him  with physical blindness. The ball destroyed both his eyes.\"    \"Dreadful!\" muttered Count Pueckler.    \"You pity him?\" asked Schill, harshly. \"You had better pity the  thousands who are lying on the bloody battle-fields of Jena and  Auerstadt, and accusing the duke of having murdered them! You had better  pity Prussia's misfortunes and disgrace, which have been brought about  by the duke! For, I tell you, the indecision, vacillation, and timidity  of the duke were the sole causes of our terrible disaster. All of us  felt and knew it. None of the younger officers and generals had any  doubt about it; every one knew that those old gentlemen, who had  outlived their own glory, and still believed that they lived in the days  of Frederick the Great, were unequal to the occasion, to the present  time, and to the present war. Because we were aware of this, we made the  utmost efforts to bring about a change of commanders. We elected a  deputation of officers, and sent them to General Kalkreuth, for the  purpose of laying our complaints and prayers before him, and of  imploring him to induce the king to deprive the duke of his command,  and to intrust it to younger and more resolute hands. The deputation  consisted of none but skilful, prominent, and highly-esteemed officers,  who boldly declared it to be their firm conviction that the king was in  danger of losing his crown and his states, if the Duke of Brunswick  should remain at the head of the army.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Vide Frederick von Gentz's writings, edited by G.  Schlesier, vol. ii., p. 314.]    \"And what did General Kalkreuth reply to them?\"    \"The general asked, in a harsh tone, for a further explanation of their  words, and the officers gave it to him. They censured the duke's idea of  establishing a camp at Weimar, and dwelt contemptuously on the reasons  that might have induced him to do so. They proved, by referring to the  whole proceedings of the duke, that he knew neither what he was doing  nor what he wanted to do; neither where he was, nor whither he was  going; and they added that, in consequence of this deplorable state of  affairs, the whole army was filled with the most startling and  discouraging rumors.[2]\"    [Footnote 2: Ibid., vol. ii., p. 315.]    \"But their prayers, their remonstrances, their angry denunciations, and  predictions, were unavailing. General Kalkreuth could not make up his  mind to represent the dangers of the situation to the king, although he  himself was just as well satisfied of its critical character as all the  younger officers of the army. And thus we were defeated, disastrously  defeated and routed, in spite of all warnings of our consciousness of  the danger, and of all predictions. This time it was not the  inexperience and impetuosity of youth, but the antiquated method and  slowness of age, that brought about our ruin.\"    \"Yes, you are right,\" sighed Count Pueckler; \"our old generals are the  cause of our misfortunes.\"    \"Do you know, for instance,\" asked Schill, indignantly, \"why we lost the  important defile of Koesen? In consequence of the night-sweat of General  von Schmettau!\"    \"Ah, you can jest even now!\" said Pueckler, sadly.    \"I do not jest, by any means; on the contrary, I am in dead earnest!  The Duke of Brunswick had ordered the general, on the day before the  battle, to start early next morning with his division, and occupy the  defile of Koesen. His adjutant, Lieutenant von Pfuel, went repeatedly to  his headquarters to remind him of the urgent necessity of setting out,  and to implore him to rise from his bed. 'But, sir,' replied the old  general, 'let me wait at least until my night-sweat is gone; I  understand it is a very chilly morning!'[3] The old general did not rise  until nine o'clock, and started at ten with his division toward Koesen.  When he reached the defile he found that Marshal Davoust had caused it  to be occupied by a regiment of infantry scarcely an hour before. That  night-sweat of the old general has become the death-sweat of many brave  Prussians, and the gray hairs of the old chieftain will now cause the  hair of our youth to turn gray with shame and grief.\"    [Footnote 3: Vide Foerster's \"Modern History of Prussia,\" vol. i., p.  757.]    \"Oh, it is a terrible disgrace for us, and I hardly know how we are to  bear it in a manly and dignified manner,\" said Count Pueckler, gloomily.  \"In these hours of melancholy only we feel the full extent of our ardent  love for our country; now only we perceive the indissoluble ties that  attach our hearts to it! I should like to pour out my blood in tears for  this crushed, disgraced, and yet so dearly-beloved country, and I feel  that if we do not rise speedily from our degradation, I shall die of  despair!\"    \"You will not die,\" said Schill, gravely, \"for all of us who love  Prussia, and are devoted to her honor, must not think of dying at the  present time; all of us must assist Prussia in rising again from the  dust, so that she may once more boldly meet the tyrant, and take revenge  for herself and for Germany! For Prussia is Germany now, because she is  the only power in Germany that has resisted and braved the Corsican  conqueror. But God wanted first to arouse her from her arrogance and  vanity, and make the weakness of her leading men known to her, that she  might rise after a noble regeneration and with redoubled strength. Life  springs from death, and Prussia had to fall so low as to break her old  decrepit limbs that were still kept together by her glory from the Seven  Years' War; and then the young, vigorous soldier of the new century will  arise and draw the sword to deliver his subjugated country, and avenge  its desecrated honor!\"    \"Then you hope still for a change for the better?\" asked Count Pueckler,  mournfully.    \"I base my hopes on the propitious star of Prussia,\" exclaimed Schill,  enthusiastically, \"on the future, on the wrath and grief which will  awake now in all Prussian hearts, arousing the sluggards, strengthening  the vacillating, and urging the timid. I base my hopes on the tears of  Queen Louisa, which will move Heaven to help us and awaken avengers on  earth. And, for ourselves, comrade, with our wounds, with our disgrace,  we must be like the spirits of vengeance that sweep across the heath in  the howling storm of diversity, and awaken the sleeper who would give  way to dreams of peace and inaction. Prussia must not make peace in her  present calamitous condition; she must fill the hearts and minds of all  with longings for war, till the whole nation arises in its rage and  expels the enemy from the country! My friend, we have now witnessed the  downfall of Prussia, but henceforth we must exert ourselves in order to  witness also her regeneration. We ourselves must be the--\"    \"Hush!\" said Pueckler, hastily. \"Just look there, and then take your  sabre.\"    They were now near a field-path leading to a small wood which a slender  youth had just left, and was hastily approaching them. As yet, however,  he was so far from them that they were unable to distinguish his  features or his dress, and to discern whether he was an armed soldier or  a peaceable wanderer.    \"It is,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19564"],[0,"The Pirates' Who's Who (#4)"],[1,"half-hearted way--half-hearted in the piratical, but not the matrimonial  sense--in the middle of the nineteenth century.    A certain settler in New Zealand in the \"early days\" describes a visit he  paid to Captain Pease and his family on board that pirate's handy little  schooner, lying at anchor in a quiet cove at that island.    On stepping aboard, the guest was warmly welcomed by a short, red-faced  man, bald of head and rotund in figure, of about fifty-five years of age.  His appearance suggested a successful grocer rather than a pirate. On the  deck were seated two ladies, one nearing middle age, the other young and  undoubtedly pretty. At the feet of these ladies sprawled several small  children. Captain Pease proceeded to introduce his guest to these as Mrs.  Pease No. 1 and Mrs. Pease No. 2. The ladies continued their sewing while  a conversation took place on various subjects. Presently, taking out his  watch, the pirate turned to the younger lady, observing that it was  nearing teatime. Mrs. Pease No. 2, laying down her sewing, went to the  cabin, from which the rattle of teacups and the hiss of a boiling kettle  were soon heard. Tea being announced as ready, the party entered the  cabin, Mrs. Pease senior taking the place at the head of the table and  pouring out the tea while the younger Mrs. Pease very prettily handed  round the cups and bread and butter, the guest particularly noticing with  what respect and thoughtfulness she looked after the wants of the elder  Mrs. Pease.    As a pirate Captain Pease was second or even third rate, confining his  daring to seizing small unarmed native craft, or robbing the stores of  lonely white traders on out-of-the-way atolls. But as a married man he  showed himself to be a master; matrimony was his strong suit, domesticity  his trump card. He gave one valuable hint to his guest, which was this:  \"Never take more than two wives with you on a voyage, _and choose 'em with  care_.\"    One is apt to disassociate serious matrimony, and still less responsible  paternity, with the calling of piracy, but with Captain Pease this was far  from being the case. Every one of his wives--for he had others on  shore--contributed her mite, or two, to the growing family, and the  Captain really could not say which of his offspring he was most proud of.  It seems at first strange that a man of Captain Pease's appearance,  figure, and settled habits, almost humdrum, should have been such an  undoubted success with the ladies; but that he was a success there can be  no doubt. Perhaps his calling had a good deal to do with this attraction  he had for them.    Before bringing this Preface to a conclusion, there is one other aspect of  piracy upon which I will touch.    Death, portrayed by a skeleton, was the device on the flag beneath which  they fought; and a skeleton was for ever threatening to emerge from its  cupboard aboard every pirate vessel.    The end of most of the pirates and a large proportion of the buccaneers  was a sudden and violent one, and few of them died in their beds. Many  were killed in battle, numbers of them were drowned. Not a few drank  themselves to death with strong Jamaica rum, while many of the buccaneers  died of malaria and yellow fever contracted in the jungles of Central  America, and most of the pirates who survived these perils lived only to  be hanged.    It is recorded of a certain ex-prizefighter and pirate, Dennis McCarthy,  who was about to be hanged at New Providence Island in 1718, that, as he  stood on the gallows, all bedecked with coloured ribbons, as became a  boxer, he told his admiring audience that his friends had often, in joke,  told him he would die in his shoes; and so, to prove them liars, he kicked  off his shoes amongst the crowd, and so died without them.    The trial of a pirate was usually a rough and ready business, and the  culprit seldom received the benefit of any doubt that might exist.    If he made any defence at all, it was usually to plead that he had been  forced to join the pirates against his wish, and that he had long been  waiting for an opportunity to escape.    Once condemned to death, and the date of execution decided, the prisoner,  if at Newgate, was handed over to the good offices of the prison Ordinary;  or, if in New England, to such vigorous apostles of Christianity as the  Rev. Cotton or the Rev. Increase Mather. The former of these two famous  theologians was pastor of the North Church in Boston, and the author of a  very rare work published in 1695, called \"An History of Some Criminals  Executed in This Land.\" Cotton Mather preached many a \"hanging\" sermon to  condemned pirates, a few of which can still be read. One of these,  preached in 1704, is called \"A Brief Discourse occasioned by a Tragical  Spectacle of a Number of Miserables under Sentence of Death for Piracy.\"    The Reverend Doctor made a speciality of these \"hanging\" sermons, and was  a thorough master of his subject, as is shown by the following passage  taken from the above \"Brief Discourse\":    \"The Privateering Stroke so easily degenerates into the Piratical; and the  Privateering Trade is usually carried on with an Unchristian Temper, and  proves an Inlet unto so much Debauchery and Iniquity.\"    On the Sunday previous to an execution the condemned pirates were taken to  church to listen to a sermon while they were \"exhibited\" to the crowded  and gaping congregation. On the day of the execution a procession was  formed, which marched from the gaol to the gallows.    At the head was carried a silver oar, the emblem from very early days of a  pirate execution. Arrived at the gibbet, the prisoner, who always dressed  himself in his, or someone else's, best clothes, would doff his hat and  make a speech.    Sometimes the bolder spirits would speak in a defiant and unrepentant way;  but most of them professed a deep repentance for their sins and warned  their listeners to guard against the temptation of drink and avarice.  After the prisoner's death the bodies of the more notorious pirates were  taken down and hanged in chains at some prominent spot where ships passed,  in order to be a warning to any mariners who had piratical leanings.    The number of pirates or buccaneers who died in their beds must have been  very small, particularly amongst the former; and I have been able to trace  but a single example of a tombstone marking the burial-place of a pirate.  This is, or was until recently, to be found in the graveyard at Dartmouth,  and records the resting-place of the late Captain Thomas Goldsmith, who  commanded the _Snap Dragon_, of Dartmouth, in which vessel he amassed much  riches during the reign of Queen Anne, and died, apparently not regretted,  in 1714. Engraved upon his headstone are the following lines:        Men that are virtuous serve the Lord;      And the Devil's by his friends ador'd;      And as they merit get a place      Amidst the bless'd or hellish race;      Pray then ye learned clergy show      Where can this brute, Tom Goldsmith, go?      Whose life was one continual evil      Striving to cheat God, Man and Devil.          THE PIRATES' WHO'S WHO      AISA. Barbary corsair.    A famous Mediterranean pirate, and one of Dragut's admirals in the  sixteenth century.      ALCANTRA, CAPTAIN MANSEL.    A Spaniard. Commanded a pirate brig, the _Macrinarian_. Committed many  outrages. Took the Liverpool packet _Topaz_, from Calcutta to Boston, in  1829, near St. Helena, murdering the whole crew. In the same year he took  the _Candace_, from Marblehead, and plundered her. The supercargo of the  _Candace_ was an amateur actor, and had on board a priest's black gown and  broad brimmed hat. These he put on and sat in his cabin pretending to tell  his beads. On the pirates coming to rob him, they all crossed themselves  and left him, so that he alone of the whole company was not robbed.      ALEXANDER, JOHN.    A Scotch buccaneer; one of Captain Sharp's crew. Drowned on May 9th, 1681.  Captain Sharp, with a party of twenty-four men, had landed on the Island  of Chiva, off the coast of Peru, and taken several prisoners, amongst whom  was a shipwright and his man, who were actually at work building two great  ships for the Spaniards. Sharp, thinking these men would be very useful to  him, took them away, with all their tools and a quantity of ironwork, in a  dory, to convey them off to his ship. But the dory, being overladen,  sank, and Alexander was drowned. On the evening of May 12th his body was  found; which they took up, and next day \"threw him overboard, giving him  three French vollies for his customary ceremony.\"      ALI BASHA.    Of Algiers. Barbary corsair.    Conquered the Kingdom of Tunis in the sixteenth century, and captured many  Maltese galleys. He brought the development of organized piracy to its  greatest perfection.    In 1571 Ali Basha commanded a fleet of no fewer than 250 Moslem galleys in  the battle of Lepanto, when he was severely defeated, but escaped with his  life.      ALLESTON, CAPTAIN.    Commanded a vessel of eighteen tons, no guns, and a crew of twenty-four.  In March, 1679, sailed in company with eight other vessels, under command  of Captain Harris, to the Coast of Darien, and marched on foot across the  isthmus, on his way attacking and sacking Santa Maria.      AMAND or ANNAND, ALEXANDER.    Of Jamaica.    One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Hanged on November  8th, 1718, at White Point, Charleston, South Carolina, and buried in the  marsh below low-water mark.      AMEER, IBRAHIM.    An admiral of an Arabian fleet of Red Sea pirates. In 1816 he captured  four British merchant vessels on their way to Surat.      ANDRESON, CAPTAIN CORNELIUS.    A Dutch pirate. Sailed from Boston in 1674 with Captain Roderigo to  plunder English ships along the coast of Maine, in a vessel called the  _Penobscot Shallop_.    Tried at Cambridge, Massachusetts, sentenced to death, "]]]
