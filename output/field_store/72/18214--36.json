And old dog Spot said that feeding good creamy milk to the  pigs was just the same as throwing it away. He made that remark to Miss  Kitty Cat, adding that it was a shame that somebody was stealing cream  and declaring that he hoped to catch the thief.    Miss Kitty Cat made no reply whatsoever.    \"Don't you hope I'll catch the guilty party?\" Spot asked her.    \"Please don't speak to me!\" Miss Kitty Cat exclaimed impatiently. \"I  don't enjoy your talk; and you may as well know it.\"    \"Very well!\" said Spot. \"But when I catch him I'll let you know.\"    \"She's jealous,\" Spot thought. \"She knows I'm a good watch dog. And she  can't bear the idea of my catching a thief.\"    It was hard, usually, to tell how Miss Kitty Cat felt about anything.  She was a great one for keeping her opinions to herself. It seemed as if  she wanted to be let alone by every one except Farmer Green's family.    Having boasted about catching the cream thief, old dog Spot began to  watch the buttery very carefully. Search as he would, he couldn't find a  chink anywhere that was big enough even for a mouse to squeeze through.    One day he happened to catch a glimpse of something moving under the  roof of the shed next the buttery. To his amazement he saw Miss Kitty  Cat slip through an old stove-pipe hole that pierced the great chimney  which led down into the buttery, where there was an ancient fireplace  which hadn't been used for years and years. Miss Kitty Cat crept along a  tiebeam and hid herself in a pile of odds and ends that somebody had  stowed high up under the roof and left there to gather dust and  cob-webs.    \"Ah, ha!\" said Spot under his breath. \"This is interesting.\"    When Miss Kitty Cat visited the kitchen a little later there wasn't a  speck of dirt on her coat. And her face was spotless. No one would have  guessed that she had ever made her way through an old chimney.    Old dog Spot said nothing to her then. But he chuckled to himself. He  had a plan that pleased him hugely.    All this happened on a morning. And late that afternoon when Miss Kitty  Cat wasn't anywhere to be seen, and Farmer Green's wife opened the  buttery door to get a pitcher of cream for supper, Spot suddenly began  to bark in the shed. He scrambled up a stepladder that leaned against  the wall and stood on the top of it while he pawed the air frantically,  as if he were trying to fly.    The noise brought Mrs. Green hurriedly out of the buttery. And she was  just in time to see Miss Kitty Cat peer out of the old stove-pipe hole,  with a _creamy_ look about her mouth.    Well, the cat was out of the bag at last. Or perhaps it would be more  exact to say that Miss Kitty was out of the buttery. Anyhow, it was very  plain to Mrs. Green that she had been in the buttery only a moment  before, lapping thick cream off a pan of milk. And she hadn't had time  to wash her face.    After that Farmer Green stopped up the stove-pipe hole. And soon Miss  Kitty's appetite for milk returned. When Mrs. Green set out her saucer  of milk for her Miss Kitty lapped it up greedily--and even licked the  saucer clean.    Old dog Spot watched her with a grin.    \"I let you know when I caught the cream thief, just as I promised you I  would,\" he jeered.    Miss Kitty wiped her face very carefully before replying.    \"Don't boast!\" she said. \"It's a disagreeable thing to do.... Besides,  _I_ knew--_long before you did_--who was taking Mrs. Green's cream.\"          XI    THE WRENS' HOME      THERE wasn't a bird on the farm that didn't dislike Miss Kitty Cat. And  there was only one bird family that didn't live in dread of her. That  was the Wren family. And they had a good reason for feeling safe from  Miss Kitty.    Miss Kitty Cat always spluttered whenever she unbent herself enough to  talk with anybody about Rusty Wren and his busy little wife, who had  their home in the cherry tree outside Farmer Green's window.    \"The Wrens needn't feel so proud of their house,\" Miss Kitty Cat  sometimes said. \"It's nothing but an old syrup can. And I know for a  fact that Mrs. Bluebird looked at it last spring when she was hunting  for a home. And she said she wouldn't live in such a place. I heard her  tell her husband so.\"    Now, the reason why Mr. and Mrs. Wren liked their house and the reason  why Miss Kitty Cat didn't were one and the same: Miss Kitty couldn't get  inside it. The mouth of the syrup can, which the Wren family used for a  door, was no bigger than a quarter of a dollar. It was entirely too  small for Miss Kitty Cat, though it was big enough to admit Rusty Wren  and his plump wife.    Miss Kitty said everything she could to persuade the Wren family to  build themselves a nest in a crotch of the tree, like other birds.    \"I'm sure,\" she told them, \"you'd like such a home much better than  this. There's no reason why you shouldn't be as fashionable as everybody  else. You wouldn't have to look for a place to build. There's room  enough right in this old cherry tree for a hundred happy homes if  anybody wanted to build them.\"    \"We like our house,\" Rusty Wren said.    \"I wouldn't move, even if he wanted to,\" Mrs. Wren declared.    \"Maybe you'd move because he _doesn't_ want to,\" Miss Kitty Cat  suggested.    But Mrs. Wren shook her head in a most decided way.    \"No!\" she said. \"I'm satisfied with my house. And our neighbors would be  far better off if they built as we do, inside a snug sort of box.\"    \"You'll never know what you're missing,\" Miss Kitty remarked, \"if you  don't try an open nest sometime. Now, only yesterday I visited Jolly  Robin's family over in the orchard. And their youngsters certainly did  look beautiful. But you keep yours hidden inside that old syrup can  where nobody can see them. It's a shame that the public can't have a  chance to admire such fine nestlings as you must have in there.\"    Miss Kitty Cat was sitting under the cherry tree. And she looked up and  smiled most agreeably at Mrs. Wren.    Rusty Wren looked thoughtful.    \"There's something in what she says,\" he whispered to his wife. \"It is  too bad not to let the neighbors admire the finest nestlings in Pleasant  Valley.\"    \"You know they say a cat may look at a king,\" Miss Kitty simpered.  \"Well, a fortnight ago I went over to the pine woods and had a look at a  Ruby Crowned Kinglet's family. So it seems only fair that I shouldn't  be denied a look at your little wrenlets.\"          XII    JOLLY ROBIN'S NEWS      IN A WAY Miss Kitty Cat was a patient creature. She could play a waiting  game. She spent hours watching rat-holes without growing restless.    So after her talk with Rusty Wren and his wife, when she urged them to  give up their boxlike house and build themselves an open nest like most  other birds, Miss Kitty left them.    \"I'll let my words sink in,\" Miss Kitty muttered to herself. \"Of course  they'll want to talk things over privately.\"    It wasn't often that she made herself so agreeable to any of the bird  people. Indeed, she had been so pleasant that Rusty Wren began to think  that Miss Kitty was a much kinder creature than he had always supposed.    \"Miss Kitty's very agreeable,\" Rusty Wren remarked to his wife. \"Did you  notice how sweetly she spoke of our children?\"    \"Huh!\" said Mrs. Wren. \"She may fool you; but she can't fool me. She's a  mealy-mouthed animal, if ever I met one.\"    \"I don't see how you can say that about Miss Kitty Cat,\" Rusty replied.  \"She doesn't eat meal.\"    \"I suppose you'll be saying next that she doesn't eat birds!\" his wife  exclaimed.    \"I fear you've been listening to gossip,\" Rusty ventured. \"If Miss Kitty  Cat comes back I hope you'll be cordial to her.\"    He could have bitten his tongue a moment later for saying that, because  Mrs. Wren began to scold him. And he flew away and left her as soon as  he could think of a good excuse.    He went over to the orchard, where he flitted about for some time. And  at last he met Jolly Robin, who appeared most doleful.    \"What's the matter?\" Rusty Wren asked. \"You look terribly upset.\"    \"So I am,\" Jolly Robin admitted. \"We had a caller yesterday.\"    \"Well, well!\" said Rusty Wren. \"That's nothing to be glum about.\"    \"You'd think so if you were I. It was Miss Kitty Cat. And when she left  she took one of our nestlings with her.\"    \"Perhaps she only borrowed it,\" Rusty Wren suggested. \"Maybe she'll  return it to-day.\"    \"No!\" Jolly Robin told him. \"If she comes back again it will only be to  take another one.\"    Suddenly Rusty Wren remembered that he had urged his wife to be cordial  to Miss Kitty Cat the next time she called at the cherry tree where they  lived.    \"I must hurry home!\" he cried. \"I must warn my wife.\"    \"But your youngsters are safe,\" Jolly Robin assured him. \"Miss Kitty Cat  can't reach them inside the tin can where you built your nest.\"    \"That's true,\" Rusty Wren admitted. \"But there's my wife! Miss Kitty  might harm her, if she caught her unawares.\" So he started for home at  top speed.          XIII    AN UNWELCOME GUEST      AS he neared his home in the cherry tree, Rusty Wren saw a fearsome  sight. Miss Kitty Cat was crouched right on top of the tin syrup can  which Johnnie Green had nailed to the tree. Inside that can was the Wren  family's nest. And inside the nest were some brand-new youngsters, only  two days out of their shells.    It was no wonder that when Rusty Wren came hack from the orchard and saw  such a sight he began to shriek.    \"What are you doing on my roof?\" he shrilled.    Miss Kitty Cat looked up calmly and watched him as he hopped about in  the top of the tree above her head.    [Illustration: Miss Kitty Cat Looked Calmly at Rusty Wren.]    \"I've come to make another call on your wife,\" she explained.    Then a muffled voice chirped, \"She's been here a long time and I can't  get her to go away.\"    The moment he heard that, Rusty Wren felt better. It was his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21081"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XLIII., No. 25, December 18, 1880 (#4)"],[1,"in its properties, and  so far must be taken as an element in any theory of vision; but the  chief point here considered is that objectively light does not exist  independent of the eye, that light is a physiological phenomenon, and to  speak of it otherwise is to confound a cause with an effect. It is,  hence, incorrect to speak of the velocity of light; it has no velocity.  It is _radiant energy_ that has the velocity of 186,000 miles a second.  It is incorrect to say we receive heat from the sun. What we do receive  is radiant energy, which is here transformed into heat. This is not  hypercritical, but is in accordance with the knowledge we have to-day.  The old nomenclature we use, but without definite meaning; the latter is  left to be inferred from the connection or context. If a man should  attach to the water main in a city a properly constructed waterwheel,  the latter will rotate; but it would not be proper to say that he  received rotation from the reservoir. What he received was water with a  certain pressure; in other words, a certain form of energy, which he  transforms into rotation by the appropriate means; but by substituting  other means he can make the same water pressure maintain a vibratory  motion, as with the hydraulic ram valve, or let it waste itself by open  flow, in which case it becomes ultimately molecular vibration that is  heat. The analogy holds strictly. The trouble all comes from neglecting  to distinguish between different forms of energy--energy in matter and  energy in the ether.           *       *       *       *       *          GLASS SPINNING AND WEAVING.      Quite recently a Pittsburg glass firm has succeeded, to a notable  degree, in producing glass threads of sufficient fineness and elasticity  to permit of their being woven into fabrics of novel character and  quality. Their success is such as to warrant the assumption that  garments of pure glass, glistening and imperishable, are among the  possibilities of the near future. The spinning of glass threads of  extreme fineness is not a new process, but, as carried on at present by  the firm in question--Messrs. Atterbury & Co.--possesses considerable  interest. From a quality of glass similar to that from which table ware  is made, rods of glass averaging half an inch in diameter are drawn to  any desired length and of various colors. These rods are then so placed  that the flame of two gas burners is blown against that end of the rod  pointed toward the large \"spinning\" wheel. The latter is 81/2 feet in  diameter, and turns at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute. The  flames, having played upon the end of the glass cylinder until a melting  heat is attained, a thread of glass is drawn from the rod and affixed to  the periphery of the wheel, whose face is about 12 inches wide. Motion  is then communicated, and the crystal thread is drawn from between the  gas jets and wrapped upon the wheel at the rate of about 7,500 feet per  minute. A higher speed results in a finer filament of glass, and vice  versa. During its passage from the flame to the wheel, a distance of  five or six feet, the thread has become cooled, and yet its elasticity  is preserved to a notable degree. The next step in the process consists  in the removal of the layers of threads from the wheel. This is easily  accomplished, and after being cut to the desired lengths, the filaments  are woven in a loom somewhat similar to that used in weaving silken  goods. Until within the past few weeks only the woof of the fabric was  of glass, but at present both warp and woof are in crystal. Samples of  this cloth have been forwarded to New York and to Chicago, and the  manufacturers claim to be able to duplicate in colors, texture, etc.,  any garments sent them. A tablecloth of glass recently completed shines  with a satiny, opalescent luster by day, and under gaslight shows  remarkable beauty. Imitation plumes, in opal, ruby, pale green, and  other hues, are also constructed of these threads, and are wonderfully  pretty. The chief obstacle yet to surmount seems to lie in the  manipulation of these threads, which are so fine that a bunch containing  250 is not so thick as an average sized knitting needle, and which do  not possess the tractability of threads of silk or cotton.      [The foregoing information is furnished by a correspondent in    Pittsburg. A sample of the goods mentioned, a tablecloth of glass,    is now on exhibition in this city.      The weaving of such heavy fabrics of glass for ornamental purposes    and for curiosities is no new thing; nor, in our estimation, does    comparative success in such experiments warrant the enthusiastic    claims of the Pittsburg manufacturers touching the adaptability of    glass for wearing apparel. Unless it is in their power to change    the nature of glass absolutely and radically, it does not seem    possible for them so to overcome the ultimate brittleness of the    separate fibers as to make the fabric fit to be brought in contact    with the skin. The woven stuff may be relatively tough and    flexible; but unless the entire fabric can be made of one    unbreakable fiber the touch of the free ends, be they never so    fine, must be anything but pleasant or beneficial, if one can    judge by the finest filaments of glass spun hitherto. Besides, in    weaving and wearing the goods, a certain amount of fiber dust must    be produced as in the case of all other textile material. When the    softest of vegetable fibers are employed the air charged with    their fragments is hurtful to the lungs; still more injurious must    be the spiculae of spun glass.      However, although the manufacturers are likely to be disappointed    in their expectation of finding in glass a cheap and available    substitute for linen, cotton, and silk in dress goods, it is quite    possible that a wide range of useful application may be found for    their new fabric.]           *       *       *       *       *          REMARKABLE ERUPTION OF MAUNA LOA.      Late advices from the Sandwich Islands describe the eruption of Mauna  Loa, which began Nov. 5, as one of the grandest ever witnessed. The  opening was about six miles from the summit of the mountain, and already  two great streams of lava had been poured out; one of them, from one to  two yards wide and twenty feet deep, had reached a distance of thirty  miles. Terrible explosions accompany the flow of the lava stream, which  for a time threatened the town of Hilo; at last reports the flow seemed  to be turning in another direction.    Mauna Loa, \"long or high mountain\" occupies a large portion of the  central and southern part of the island of Hawaii, and reaches an  elevation of 13,760 feet. It has been built up by lavas thrown out in a  highly fluid state, and flowing long distances before cooling; as a  consequence the slopes of the mountain are very gentle, averaging,  according to Prof. Dana, not more than six and a half degrees. Its  craters are numerous, and usually occur near the summit and on the  sides, new ones opening frequently, and furnishing, as in the latest  instance, magnificent lava streams. The terminal crater is circular,  8,000 feet in diameter, and in 1864 was about 1,000 feet deep. In 1859  an enormous lava fountain spouted from this crater for four or five  days, throwing a column of white hot fluid lava about 200 feet in  diameter to the height of two or three hundred feet. The lava stream ran  50 miles to the sea in eight days. Other great eruptions have occurred  in 1832, 1840, 1843, 1852, 1855, 1868 and 1873. The lava streams poured  out in 1840, 1859, and 1868, flowed to the sea, adding considerably to  the area of the island. Those of 1843 and 1855 are estimated to have  poured out respectively 17,000,000,000 and 38,000,000,000 cubic feet of  lava. In 1868 the lava stream forced its way under ground a distance of  twenty miles, and burst forth from a fissure two miles long, throwing up  enormous columns of crimson lava and red hot rock to the height of five  or six hundred feet.    On the eastern part of Mauna Loa, 16 miles from the summit crater, is  Kilauea, the largest continuously active crater in the world. It is  eight miles in circumference, and 1,000 feet deep. Its eruptions are  generally independent of those of Mauna Loa.           *       *       *       *       *          NEW AIR ENGINE.      A valuable improvement in compressed air engines has recently been  patented in this country and in Europe by Col. F. E. B. Beaumont, of the  Royal Engineers, and we learn from accounts given in the London and  provincial papers that it has proved highly efficient and satisfactory.    The engine possesses some peculiar features which render it very  economical in the use of compressed air. It has two cylinders, one being  much larger than the other. Into the smaller of these cylinders the  compressed air is taken directly from the reservoir, and after doing its  work there it is discharged into the larger cylinder, where it is  further expanded, being finally discharged into the open air.    The admission of air to the smaller cylinder is regulated by an  adjustable cut-off apparatus, which admits of maintaining a uniform  power under a variable pressure. When the reservoir at first starting  contains air at a very high pressure, the cut-off is adjusted so that  the small cylinder receives a very small charge of air at each stroke;  when the pressure in the reservoir diminishes the cut-off is delayed so  that a larger quantity of air is admitted to the small cylinder; and  when the pressure in the reservoir is so far reduced that the pressure  on the smaller piston gives very little power, the supply passages are  kept open so that the air acts directly on the piston of the larger  cylinder. This arrangement is also available when the air pressure is  high and great power is required for a short time, as, for example, in  starting"]]]
