At last she stretched her  arms 'round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge  with each hand.    \"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of  the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent  blow underneath her chin--it had struck her foot!    She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, as she was  shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other  bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was  hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last and managed to  swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit....    \"Come, my head's free at last!\" said Alice; but all she could see, when  she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise  like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.    \"Where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I  can't see you?\" She was delighted to find that her neck would bend  about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in  curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among  the leaves, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry--a large  pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its  wings.    [Illustration]    \"Serpent!\" cried the Pigeon.    \"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"    \"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried  hedges,\" the Pigeon went on, \"but those serpents! There's no pleasing  them!\"    Alice was more and more puzzled.    \"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon,  \"but I must be on the look-out for serpents, night and day! And just as  I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the Pigeon, raising  its voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I should be free of  them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh,  Serpent!\"    \"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a--I'm a--I'm a  little girl,\" she added rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number  of changes she had gone through that day.    \"You're looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough,\" said the Pigeon;  \"and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a  serpent?\"    \"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I'm not  looking for eggs, as it happens, and if I was, I shouldn't want  _yours_--I don't like them raw.\"    \"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled  down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as  she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and  every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After awhile she  remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and  she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the  other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had  succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.    It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it  felt quite strange at first. \"The next thing is to get into that  beautiful garden--how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this,  she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about  four feet high. \"Whoever lives there,\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to  come upon them _this_ size; why, I should frighten them out of their  wits!\" She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought  herself down to nine inches high.          VI--PIG AND PEPPER      For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, when suddenly a  footman in livery came running out of the wood (judging by his face  only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door  with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a  round face and large eyes like a frog.    [Illustration]    The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,  and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \"For the  Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\" The  Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, \"From the Queen. An  invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\" Then they both bowed low  and their curls got entangled together.    When Alice next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was  sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.  Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked.    \"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for  two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are;  secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could  possibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise  going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then  a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.    \"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice.    \"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's the first  question, you know.\"    Alice opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large  kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other; the Duchess  was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the  cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to  be full of soup.    \"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!\" Alice said to herself,  as well as she could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed  occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling  alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the  kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was  grinning from ear to ear.    \"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why your cat  grins like that?\"    \"It's a Cheshire-Cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's why.\"    \"I didn't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know  that cats _could_ grin,\" said Alice.    \"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's a fact.\"    Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once  set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the  baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,  plates and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they  hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite  impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.    \"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down  in an agony of terror.    \"Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,  flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play  croquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room.    Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped  little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions. \"If I  don't take this child away with me,\" thought Alice, \"they're sure to  kill it in a day or two. Wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?\" She  said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply.    \"If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,\" said Alice, \"I'll have  nothing more to do with you. Mind now!\"    Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do with  this creature, when I get it home?\" when it grunted again so violently  that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there  could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig;  so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it  trot away quietly into the wood.    Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a  bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her.  \"Cheshire-Puss,\" began Alice, rather timidly, \"would you please tell me  which way I ought to go from here?\"    \"In _that_ direction,\" the Cat said, waving the right paw 'round, \"lives  a Hatter; and in _that_ direction,\" waving the other paw, \"lives a March  Hare. Visit either you like; they're both mad.\"    \"But I don't want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.    \"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat; \"we're all mad here. Do you  play croquet with the Queen to-day?\"    \"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited  yet.\"    \"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.    Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of  the March Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near  till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.          VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY      There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the  March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting  between them, fast asleep.    The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at  one corner of it. \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice  coming. \"There's _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and she sat  down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.    The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said  was \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"    \"I'm glad they've begun asking riddles--I believe I can guess that,\" she  added aloud.    \"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said the  March Hare.    \"Exactly so,\" said Alice.    \"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.    \"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least--at least I mean what I  say--that's the same thing, you know.\"    \"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, which seemed to be  talking in its sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing  as 'I sleep when I breathe!'\"    \"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a  little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently  and said, without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#4)"],[1,"only fifty years  ago, and the differentiation which has taken place in Europe due to  climate, intermarriage, laws, and customs seems easy to trace and to  explain.    The fishermen and tillers of the soil in the Scandinavian peninsula,  afterward the settlers in the Saxon plain and in England, recognized  him who ruled over their settled place of abode as king; while roaming  bands of fighting men would naturally attach themselves to the head of  the tribe, as the leader in war, and recognize him as king. As late as  the death of Charlemagne, when his powerful grip relaxed, the tribes  of Germans, for they were little more even then, fell apart again.  Another family like that of Pepin arose under Robert the Strong, and  under Hugue Capet (987) acquired the title of Kings of France. The  monarchy grew out of the weakening of feudalism, and feudalism had  been the gradual setting, in law and custom, of a way of living  together, of these detached tribes and clans, and their chiefs.    A powerful warrior was rewarded with a horse, a spear; later, when  territory was conquered and the tribe settled down, land was given as  a reward. Land, however, does not die like a horse, or wear out and  get broken like a spear, and the problem arises after the death of the  owner, as to who is his rightful heir. Does it revert to the giver,  the chief of the tribe, or does it go to the children of the owner?  Some men are strong enough to keep their land, to add to it, to  control those living upon it, and such a one becomes a feudal ruler in  a small way himself. He becomes a duke, a dux or leader, a count, a  margrave, a baron, and a few such powerful men stand by one another  against the king. A Charlemagne, a William the Conqueror, a Louis XIV  is strong enough to rule them and keep them in order for a time. Out  of these conditions grow limited monarchies or absolute monarchies and  national nobilities.    More than any other one factor, the Crusades broke up feudalism. The  great noble, impelled by a sense of religious duty, or by a love of  adventure, arms himself and his followers, and starts on years of  journeyings to the Holy Land. Ready money is needed above all else.  Lands are mortgaged, and the money-lender and the merchant buy lands,  houses, and eventually power, and buy them cheap. The returning nobles  find their affairs in disarray, their fields cultivated by new owners,  towns and cities grow up that are as strong or stronger than the  castle. Before the Crusades no roturier, or mere tiller of the soil,  could hold a fief, but the demand for money was so great that fiefs  were bought and sold, and Philippe Auguste (1180) solved the problem  by a law, declaring that when the king invested a man with a  sufficient holding of land or fief, he became ipso facto a noble. This  is the same common-sense policy which led Sir Robert Peel to declare,  that any man with an income of $50,000 a year had a right to a  peerage. There can be no aristocracy except of the powerful, which  lasts. The difference to-day is seen in the puppet nobility of  Austria, Italy, Spain, and Germany as compared with the nobility of  England, which is not a nobility of birth or of tradition, but of the  powerful: brewers and bankers, and statesmen and lawyers, and leaders  of public opinion, covering their humble past with ermine, and  crowning their achievements with coronets.    The Crusades brought about as great a shifting of the balance of  power, as did later the rise of the rich merchants, industrials, and  nabobs in England. As the power of the nobles decreased, the central  power or the power of the kings increased; increased indeed, and  lasted, down to the greatest crusade of all, when democracy organized  itself, and marched to the redemption of the rights of man as man,  without regard to his previous condition of servitude.    During the thousand years between the time when we first hear of the  German tribes, in 113 B. C., and the year 1411, which marks the  beginnings of what is now the Prussian monarchy, customs were becoming  habits, and habits were becoming laws, and the political and social  origins of the life of our day were being beaten into shape, by the  exigencies of living together of these tribes in the woods of Germany.    There it was that the essence of democracy was distilled. Democracy,  Demos, the crowd, the people, the nation, were already, in the woods  of Germany, the court of last resort. They growled dissent, and they  gave assent with the brandishing of their weapons, javelins, or  ballots. They were called together but seldom, and between the  meetings of the assembly, the executive work, the judicial work, the  punishing of offenders, was left to a chosen few; left to those who by  their control over themselves, their control over their families,  their control over their neighbors, seemed best qualified to exercise  the delegated control of all.    The chief aim of their organized government, such as it was, seems to  have been to leave themselves free to go about their private business,  with as little interference from the demands of public business as  possible. The chief concern of each one was to secure his right to  mind his own business, under certain safeguards provided by all. If  those delegated to govern became autocratic, or evil-doers, or used  their power for self-advancement or self-enrichment, they were  speedily brought to book. The philosophy of government, then, was to  make men free to go about their private business. That the time might  come when politics would be the absorbing business of all, dictating  the hours and wages of men under the earth, and reaching up to the  institution of a recall for the angel Gabriel, and a referendum for  the Day of Judgment, was undreamed of. The chiefs of the clans, the  chiefs of the tribes, the kings of the Germans, and finally the  emperors were all elective. The divine right of kings is a purely  modern development. The descendants of these German tribes in England,  elected their king in the days of William the Conqueror even, and as  late as 1689 the Commons of England voted that King James had  abdicated, and that the throne was vacant!    The so-called mayors of the palace, who became kings, were in their  day representatives of the landholders, delegates of the people, who  advised the king and aided in commanding the armies. These hereditary  mayors of the palace drifted into ever greater and greater control,  until they became hereditary kings. The title was only hereditary,  however, because it was convenient that one man of experience in an  office should be succeeded by another educated to, and familiar with,  the same experiences and duties, and this system of heredity continues  down to this day in business, and in many professions and so long as  there is freedom to oust the incompetent, it is a good system. There  can never be any real progress until the sons take over the  accumulated wisdom and experience of the fathers; if this is not done,  then each one must begin for himself all over again. The hereditary  principle is sound enough, so long as there is freedom of decapitation  in cases of tyranny or folly.    There has continued all through the history of those of the blood of  the German tribes, whether in Germany, England, America, Norway,  Sweden, or Denmark, the sound doctrine that ability may at any time  take the place of the rights of birth. Power, or command, or  leadership by heredity is looked upon as a convenience, not as an  unimpeachable right.    Charlemagne (742-814), a descendant of a mayor of the palace who had  become king by virtue of ability, swept all Europe under his sway by  reason of his transcendent powers as a warrior and administrator. He  did for the first time for Europe what Akbar did in his day for India.  In forty-five years he headed fifty-three campaigns against all sorts  of enemies. He fought the Saxons, the Danes, the Slays, the Arabs, the  Greeks, and the Bretons. What is now France, Germany, Belgium,  Holland, Switzerland, Spain, and most of Italy were under his  kingship. He was a student, an architect, a bridge-builder, though he  could neither read nor write, and even began a canal which was to  connect the Danube and the Rhine, and thus the German Ocean, with the  Black Sea. He is one of many monuments to the futility of technical  education and mere book-learning.    The Pope, roughly handled, because negligently protected, by the Roman  emperors, turns to Charlemagne, and on Christmas Day (800) places a  crown upon his head, and proclaims him \"Caesar Augustus\" and  \"Christianissimus Rex.\" The empire of Rome is to be born again with  this virile German warrior at its head. Just a thousand years later,  another insists that he has succeeded to the title by right of  conquest, and gives his baby son the title of \"King of Rome,\" and just  a thousand years after the death of Charlemagne, in 814, Napoleon  retires to Elba. There is a witchery about Rome even to-day, and an  emperor still sits imprisoned there, claiming for himself the right to  rule the spiritual and intellectual world: \"sedet, eternumque sedebit  Infelix Theseus.\"    Louis, called \"the Pious,\" because the latter part of his life was  spent in mourning his outrageous betrayal, mutilation, and murder of  his own nephew, whose rivalry he feared, succeeded his father,  Charlemagne. He was succeeded again by his three sons, Lothair, Pepin,  and Louis by his first wife, and Charles, who was his favorite son, by  his second wife. He had already divided the great heritage left him by  Charlemagne between his three sons Lothair, Pepin, and Louis; but now  he wished to make another division into four parts, to make room for,  and to give a kingdom to, his son Charles by his second wife. The  three elder sons revolt against their father, and his last years are  spent in vain attempts to reconcile his"]]]
