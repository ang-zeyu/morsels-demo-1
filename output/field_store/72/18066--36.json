The man they had rescued had turned against one such maddened leader and  had been imprisoned just before an attack upon the largest of the  colony's cities. After that he remembered nothing.    Varta stopped trying to follow the conversation--Lur was only explaining  now how they had found the space man and brought him out of the wrecked  ship. No human on Erb, this one had said, and yet were there not her own  people, the ones who had built Memphir? And what of the barbarians, who,  ruthless and cruel as they seemed by the standards of Memphir, were  indeed men? Whence had they come then, the men of Memphir and the  ancestors of the barbarian hordes? Her hands touched the scaled skin of  the suit she still wore and then rubbed across her own smooth flesh.  Could one have come from the other, was she of the blood and heritage of  Lur?    \"Not so!\" Lur's mind, as quick as his flickering tongue, had caught that  panic-born thought. \"You are of the blood of this space wanderer. Men  from the riven colonies must have escaped to safety. Look at this man,  is he not like the men of Memphir--as they were in the olden days of the  city's greatness?\"    The stranger was tall, taller than the men of Memphir and there was a  certain hardness about him which those city dwellers in ease had never  displayed. But Lur must be right, this was a man of her race. She smiled  in sudden relief and he answered that smile. Lur's soft laughter rang in  both their heads.    \"Asti in His Infinite Wisdom can see through Centuries. Memphir has  fallen because of its softness and the evildoing of its people and the  barbarians will now have their way with the lands of the north. But to  me it appears that Asti is not yet done with the pattern He was weaving  there. To each of you He granted a second life. Do not disdain the Gifts  of Asti, Daughter of Erb!\"    Again Varta felt the warm tide of blood rise in her cheeks. But she no  longer smiled. Instead she regarded the outlander speculatively.    Not even a Maiden of the Temple could withstand the commands of the All  Highest. Gifts from the Hand of Asti dared not be thrown away.    Above the puzzlement of the stranger she heard the chuckling of Lur.

The King _v._ Richard Bowman. The  defendant was a brewer, living in Wapping-street, Wapping, and was  charged with having in his possession a drug called _multum_, and a  quantity of copperas.    The articles were produced by Thomas Gates, an excise officer, who had,  after a search, found them on the defendant's premises. The Court  sentenced the defendant to pay a fine of 200_l._    The King _v._ Luke Lyons. The defendant is a brewer, and was brought up  under an indictment charging him with having made use of various  deleterious drugs in his brewery, among which were capsicum, copperas,  &c. The defendant was ordered to pay the fines of 20_l._ upon the first  count, 200_l._ upon the third, and 200_l._ upon the seventh count in the  indictment.    The King _v._ Thomas Evans. The charge against this defendant was, that  he had in his possession forty-seven barrels of stale unpalatable beer.  On, the 11th of March, John Wilson, an excise officer, went to the  storehouse, and found forty-seven casks containing forty-three barrels  and a half of sour unwholesome beer. Several samples of the beer were  produced, all of them of a different colour, and filled with sediment. A  fine of 30_l._ was ordered to be paid by the defendant.

The white sort, which  has no wrinkles, and no perceptible bitterness in taste, and which,  though taken in a large dose, has scarcely any effect at all, after  being pulverised by fraudulent druggists, and mixed with a portion of  emetic tartar, is sold, at a low price, for the powder of genuine  ipecacuanha root.

REMARKS    ON THE    Effect of different Kinds of Waters    IN THEIR APPLICATION TO    DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE ARTS;    AND    METHODS OF ASCERTAINING THEIR PURITY.      It requires not much reflection to become convinced that the waters  which issue from the recesses of the earth, and form springs, wells,  rivers, or lakes, often materially differ from each other in their taste  and other obvious properties. There are few people who have not observed  a difference in the waters used for domestic purposes and in the arts;  and the distinctions of _hard_ and _soft_ water are familiar to every  body.    Water perfectly pure is scarcely ever met with in nature.    It must also be obvious, that the health and comfort of families, and  the conveniences of domestic life, are materially affected by the supply  of good and wholesome water. Hence a knowledge of the quality and  salubrity of the different kinds of waters employed in the common  concerns of life, on account of the abundant daily use we make of them  in the preparation of food, is unquestionably an object of considerable  importance, and demands our attention.    The effects produced by the foreign matters which water may contain, are  more considerable, and of greater importance, than might at first be  imagined. It cannot be denied, that such waters as are _hard_, or loaded  with earthy matter, have a decided effect upon some important functions  of the human body. They increase the distressing symptoms under which  those persons labour who are afflicted with what is commonly called  gravel complaints; and many other ailments might be named, that are  always aggravated by the use of waters abounding in saline and earthy  substances.    The purity of the waters employed in some of the arts and manufactures,  is an object of not less consequence. In the process of brewing malt  liquors, soft water is preferable to hard. Every brewer knows that the  largest possible quantity of the extractive matter of the malt is  obtained in the least possible time, and at the smallest cost, by means  of soft water.    In the art of the dyer, hard water not only opposes the solution of  several dye stuffs, but it also alters the natural tints of some  delicate colours; whilst in others again it precipitates the earthy and  saline matters with which it is impregnated, into the delicate fibres of  the stuff, and thus impedes the softness and brilliancy of the dye.    The bleacher cannot use with advantage waters impregnated with earthy  salts; and a minute portion of iron imparts to the cloth a yellowish  hue.    To the manufacturer of painters' colours, water as pure as possible is  absolutely essential for the successful preparation of several delicate  pigments. Carmine, madder lake, ultramarine, and Indian yellow, cannot  be prepared without perfectly pure water.    For the steeping or raiting of flax, soft water is absolutely necessary;  in hard water the flax may be immersed for months, till its texture be  injured, and still the ligneous matter will not be decomposed, and the  fibres properly separated.    In the culinary art, the effects of water more or less pure are  likewise obvious. Good and pure water softens the fibres of animal and  vegetable matters more readily than such as is called _hard_. Every cook  knows that dry or ripe pease, and other farinaceous seeds, cannot  _readily_ be boiled soft in hard water; because the farina of the seed  is not perfectly soluble in water loaded with earthy salts.    Green esculent vegetable substances are more tender when boiled in soft  water than in hard water; although hard water imparts to them a better  colour. The effects of hard and soft water may be easily shown in the  following manner.      EXPERIMENT.    Let two separate portions of tea-leaves be macerated, by precisely the  same processes, in circumstances all alike, in similar and separate  vessels, the one containing hard and the other soft water, either hot or  cold, the infusion made with the soft water will have by far the  strongest taste, although it possesses less colour than the infusion  made with the hard water. It will strike a more intense black with a  solution of sulphate of iron, and afford a more abundant precipitate,  with a solution of animal jelly, which at once shews that soft water has  extracted more tanning matter, and more gallic acid, from the  tea-leaves, than could be obtained from them under like circumstances by  means of hard water.    Many animals which are accustomed to drink soft water, refuse hard  water. Horses in particular prefer the former. Pigeons refuse hard water  when they have been accustomed to soft water.      CHARACTERS OF GOOD WATER.    A good criterion of the purity of water fit for domestic purposes, is  its softness. This quality is at once obvious by the touch, if we only  wash our hands in it with soap. Good water should be beautifully  transparent; a slight opacity indicates extraneous matter. To judge of  the perfect transparency of water, a quantity of it should be put into a  deep glass vessel, the larger the better, so that we can look down  perpendicularly into a considerable mass of the fluid; we may then  readily discover the slightest degree of muddiness much better than if  the water be viewed through the glass placed between the eye and the  light. It should be perfectly colourless, devoid of odour, and its  taste soft and agreeable. It should send out air-bubbles when poured  from one vessel into another; it should boil pulse soft, and form with  soap an uniform opaline fluid, which does not separate after standing  for several hours.    It is to the presence of common air and carbonic acid gas that common  water owes its taste, and many of the good effects which it produces on  animals and vegetables. Spring water, which contains more air, has a  more lively taste than river water.    Hence the insipid or vapid taste of newly boiled water, from which these  gases are expelled: fish cannot live in water deprived of those elastic  fluids.    100 cubic inches of the New River water, with which part of this  metropolis is supplied, contains 2,25 of carbonic acid, and 1,25 of  common air. The water of the river Thames contains rather a larger  quantity of common air, and a smaller portion of carbonic acid.    If water not fully saturated with common air be agitated with this  elastic fluid, a portion of the air is absorbed; but the two chief  constituent gases of the atmosphere, the oxygen and nitrogen, are not  equally affected, the former being absorbed in preference to the latter.    According to Mr. Dalton, in agitating water with atmospheric air,  consisting of 79 of nitrogen, and 21 of oxygen, the water absorbs 1/64  of 79/100 nitrogen gas = 1,234, and 1/27 of 21/100 oxygen gas = 778,  amounting in all to 2,012.    Water is freed from foreign matter by distillation: and for any chemical  process in which accuracy is"]]]
