The right of suffrage is, therefore, most  clearly not an absolutely inalienable right universal in its  application. It has its limits. These limits are marked out by plain  justice and common-sense. Women have thus far been excluded from the  suffrage precisely on the same principles--from the conviction that to  grant them this particular privilege would, in different ways, and  especially by withdrawing them from higher and more urgent duties, and  allotting to them other duties for which they are not so well fitted,  become injurious to the nation, and, we add, ultimately injurious to  themselves, also, as part of the nation. If it can be proved that this  conviction is sound and just, founded on truth, the assumed inalienable  right of suffrage, of which we have been hearing so much lately,  vanishes into the \"baseless fabric of a vision.\" If the right were  indeed inalienable, it should be granted, without regard to  consequences, as an act of abstract justice. But, happily for us, none  but the very wildest theorists are prepared to take this view of the  question of suffrage. The advocates of female suffrage must, therefore,  abandon the claim of inalienable right. Such a claim can not logically  be maintained for one moment in the face of existing facts. We proceed  to the third point.      THIRDLY. THE ELEVATION OF THE ENTIRE SEX, THE GENERAL PURIFICATION OF  POLITICS THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF WOMEN, AND THE CONSEQUENT ADVANCE OF  THE WHOLE RACE. Such, we are told, must be the inevitable results of  what is called the emancipation of woman, the entire independence of  woman through the suffrage.    Here we find ourselves in a peculiar position. While considering the  previous points of this question we have been guided by positive facts,  clearly indisputable in their character. Actual, practical experience,  with the manifold teachings at her command, has come to our aid. But we  are now called upon, by the advocates of this novel doctrine, to change  our course entirely. We are under orders to sail out into unknown seas,  beneath skies unfamiliar, with small light from the stars, without  chart, without pilot, the port to which we are bound being one as yet  unvisited by mortal man--or woman! Heavy mist, and dark cloud, and  threatening storm appear to us brooding over that doubtful sea. But  something of prophetic vision is required of us. We are told that all  perils which seem to threaten the first stages of our course are  entirely illusive--that they will vanish as we approach--that we shall  soon arrive in halcyon waters, and regions where wisdom, peace, and  purity reign supreme. If we cautiously inquire after some assurance of  such results, we are told that to those sailing under the flag of  progress triumph is inevitable, failure is impossible; and that many of  the direst evils hitherto known on earth must vanish at the touch of  the talisman in the hand of woman--and that talisman is the vote.    Now, to speak frankly--and being as yet untrammeled by political  aspirations, we fearlessly do so--as regards this flag of progress, we  know it to be a very popular bit of bunting; but to the eye of  common-sense it is grievously lacking in consistency. The flag of our  country means something positive. We all love it; we all honor it. It  represents to us the grand ideas by which the nation lives. It is the  symbol of constitutional government, of law and order, of union, of a  liberty which is not license. It is to us the symbol of all that may be  great and good and noble in the Christian republic. But this vaunted  flag of progress, so alluring to many restless minds, is vague in its  colors, unstable, too often illusive, in web and woof. Many of its most  prominent standard-bearers are clad in the motley garb of theorists.  Their flag may be seen wandering to and fro, hither and thither, up and  down, swayed by every breath of popular caprice; so it move to the mere  cry of \"Progress!\" its followers are content. To-day, in the hands of  the skeptical philosopher, it assaults the heavens. Tomorrow it may:  float over the mire of Mormonism, or depths still more vile. It was  under the flag of progress that, in the legislative halls of France,  the name of the Holy Lord God of Hosts, \"who inhabiteth eternity,\" was  legally blasphemed. It was under the flag of progress that, on the 10th  of November, 1793, Therese Momoro, Goddess of Reason, and wife of the  printer Momoro, was borne in triumph, by throngs of worshipers, through  the streets of Paris, and enthroned in the house of God.    Beyond all doubt, there is now, as there ever has been, an onward  progress toward truth on earth. But that true progress is seldom rapid,  excepting perhaps in the final stages of some particular movement. It  is, indeed, often so slow, so gradual, as to be imperceptible at the  moment to common observation. It is often silent, wonderful,  mysterious, sublime. It is the grand movement toward the Divine Will,  working out all things for eventual good. In looking back, there are  for every generation way-marks by which the course of that progress may  be traced. In looking forward no mortal eye can foresee its immediate  course. The ultimate end we know, but the next step we can not  foretell. The mere temporary cry of progress from human lips has often  been raised in direct opposition to the true course of that grand,  mysterious movement. It is like the roar of the rapids in the midst of  the majestic stream, which, in the end, shall yield their own foaming  waters to the calm current moving onward to the sea. We ask, then, for  something higher, safer, more sure, to guide us than the mere popular  cry of \"Progress!\" We dare not blindly follow that cry, nor yield  thoughtless allegiance to every flag it upholds.    Then, again, as regards that talisman, the vote, we have but one answer  to make. We do not believe in magic. We have a very firm and  unchangeable faith in free institutions, founded on just principles. We  entirely believe that a republican form of government in a Christian  country may be the highest, the noblest, and the happiest that the  world has yet seen. Still, we do not believe in magic. And we do not  believe in idolatry. We Americans are just as much given to idolatry as  any other people. Our idols may differ from those of other nations; but  they are, none the less, still idols. And it strikes the writer that  the ballot-box is rapidly becoming an object of idolatry with us. Is it  not so? From the vote alone we expect all things good. From the vote  alone we expect protection against all things evil. Of the vote  Americans can never have too much--of the vote they can never have  enough. The vote is expected by its very touch, suddenly and  instantaneously, to produce miraculous changes; it is expected to make  the foolish wise, the ignorant knowing, the weak strong, the fraudulent  honest. It is expected to turn dross into gold. It is held to be the  great educator, not only as regards races, and under the influence of  time, which is in a measure true, but as regards individuals and  classes of men, and that in the twinkling of an eye, with magical  rapidity. Were this theory practically sound, the vote would really  prove a talisman. In that case we should give ourselves no rest until  the vote were instantly placed in the hands of every Chinaman landing  in California, and of every Indian roving over the plains. But, in  opposition to this theory, what is the testimony of positive facts  known to us all? Are all voters wise? Are all voters honest? Are all  voters enlightened? Are all voters true to their high responsibilities?  Are all voters faithful servants of their country? Is it entirely true  that the vote has necessarily and really these inherent magical powers  of rapid education for individuals and for classes of men, fitting  them, in default of other qualifications, for the high responsibilities  of suffrage? Alas! we know only too well that when a man is not already  honest and just and wise and enlightened, the vote he holds can not  make him so. We know that if he is dishonest, he will sell his vote; if  he is dull and ignorant, he is misled, for selfish purposes of their  own, by designing men. As regards man, at least, the vote can be too  easily proved to be no talisman. It is very clear that for man the  ballot-box needs to be closely guarded on one side by common-sense, on  the other by honesty. A man must be endowed with a certain amount of  education and of principle, before he receives the vote, to fit him for  a worthy use of it. And if the vote be really no infallible talisman  for man, why should we expect it to work magical wonders in the hands  of woman?    But let us drop the play of metaphor, appropriate though it be when  facing the visions of political theorists. Let us look earnestly and  clearly at the positive facts before us. We are gravely told that to  grant the suffrage to woman would be a step inevitably beneficial and  elevating to the whole sex, and, through their influence, to the entire  race, and that, on this ground alone, the proposed change in the  constitution should be made. Here, so far at least as the concluding  proposition goes, we must all agree. If it can be clearly proved that  this particular change in our institutions is one so fraught with  blessings, we are bound to make it at every cost. The true elevation of  the whole race: that is what we are all longing for, praying for. And  is it indeed true that this grand work can effectually be brought about  by the one step we are now urged to take? What says actual experience  on this point? The whole history of mankind shows clearly that, as yet,  no one legislative act has ever accomplished half "]]]
