There were  several very remarkable things connected with this discovery. The boots  were what are called \"rights and lefts,\" and in a good state of  preservation. The crosier was perfect, and a part of the body was hard,  and of a copper-coloured hue, whilst the other part was decomposed. The  body was headless, and a piece of lead was found lying in _place of  the skull_, with this inscription upon it--        ABBAS: ALEXANDR:    These remains were gathered together, replaced in the shell, and buried  in the south aisle, nearly opposite the burial place of Mary Queen of  Scots.    Martin de Ramsey was chosen abbot after the death of Alexander. His  election was sanctioned by the king, and he was confirmed by the Bishop  of Lincoln, at Westminster. There is nothing remarkable recorded of  this abbot. He \"disafforested\" several lands about _Peterburgh_, and  added them to the possessions of the monastery.    During the rule of this abbot, Pope Gregory IX. ordered that when there  should be an interdiction of the monastery lands, the monks should  close their doors, and not allow the people to hear their prayers, or  participate in them; but the privilege was granted to the monks of  Peterborough to say the service in a low voice to themselves, the  ringing of the bell being dispensed with.    Martin ruled six years, died in 1232, and was succeeded by Walter de  St. Edmond, in 1233. It was during the government of this abbot that  the monastery of _Peterburgh_ was re-dedicated and consecrated with  holy oil, by the Bishops of Lincoln and Exeter [1238], according to the  decrees of the constitution of Otto.[10] The ceremony was attended with  the usual pomp of such proceedings, and the possessions of the  monastery were ratified anew. Walter de Whittlesea gives a very  favourable account of the disposition of this abbot, and speaks very  highly of his benevolence to King Henry, who was reduced to the  necessity of seeking support from this and other monasteries. St.  Edmond entertained the king twice at _Peterburgh_, in company with the  queen and the young prince. He also \"gave 60 marks towards the marriage  of Margaret, his daughter, with Alexander III., King of Scotland,\" and  increased the number of his monks to one hundred and ten. He made  likewise three several journeys to Rome upon civil and ecclesiastical  business. The cause of one of these journeys was this:--The Pope  (Gregory, 1241) sent messages to _Burgh_, demanding that the abbot  should give unto one of his favourites a certain yearly sum, or a  number of lands equal to that sum, and the abbot refused to do so  without the consent of the king who was patron of the monastery; and  going to Rome to know the cause of such an arbitrary demand, he was  reproved by the Pope in person, and treated with great indignity by the  cardinals, and expelled the court. The abbot was so much grieved, by  this cruel and ungenerous treatment that he never recovered, but died  in the same year [1245], after having ruled twelve years with the  greatest mildness, prudence, and benevolence. This story of the Pope's  arbitrary conduct calls forth a very pithy couplet from Gunton--        \"Rome gnaweth hands as dainty cates,      And when it cannot gnaw--it hates.\"    Walter was a learned man, and increased the books of the library.  Gunton says \"he was pious and merciful to all, exacted nothing unduly  of his tenants, whether rich or poor; but if any poor man or woman made  their necessities known to him, he would burst into tears, and take  compassion upon them.\"    The next abbot of whom we read is William de Hotot, who was elected on  the 6th of February, 1246. His rule was not favourable to the  monastery. He lavished the possessions of the church upon his friends  and kinsmen. His conduct was reprehended by the monks, and finally  represented to the Bishop of Lincoln, when William, fearing he should  be deposed, resigned his office, and retired upon an allowance from the  monastery in 1249, after governing three years.    Mr. Owen Davys, in his Guide to the Cathedral, remarks that \"it is a  matter of great surprise that we have no record handed down to us of  the exact date when that magnificent appendage to the Cathedral, the  western front, was erected, though it must have been about this time.  The name of the architect under whose directions this original and  strikingly beautiful design was carried out is also buried in  obscurity. This noble front is almost entirely built in the style  usually known by the name of early English Gothic, of which it is,  perhaps, the finest example we have now left us.    \"It would seem that scarcely any time elapsed between the building of  the western transepts of this monastic church and the commencement of  the west front, as the style of the western transepts is Late  Transition Norman, and in some places almost Early English, and that of  the west front pure Early English. Now, as the Transition Norman gave  place to the Early English in this country, about the commencement of  the thirteenth century, it would seem probable that these western  transepts were built at that time, probably during the government of  Acharius [1200]; these works being carried on by Robert de Lindsay, his  successor, might have been completed by him: the mixture of Early  English work with that of the former style in them may thus be  satisfactorily accounted for. It would seem, therefore, that these  transepts were erected before the time of Walter St. Edmonds, and that  the building of the west front probably followed immediately after the  erection of them. Mr. Britton, in his 'History and Antiquities of  Peterborough Cathedral,' page 56, refers the building of this  interesting feature of the church to the times of Acharius and Robert  de Lindsay. It would seem, however, that though it was probably begun  in the time of the latter abbot, it was not finished till the time of  John de Caleto, who came to the government of this abbey A.D. 1249. The  reason for this opinion is the similarity of some of its details to  those of the infirmary church, which was erected by this abbot. Some  beautiful portions of this church are still to be seen. This abbot is  said to have been a great builder; and it is probable that the  refectory and south cloister were rebuilt by him; and that the door by  which the Bishop usually enters the Cathedral, was inserted at the same  time. The Chapel of St. Lawrance, which stood at the east end of the  infirmary church, seems to have been erected about this time. There was  an entrance into this chapel, from the infirmary church, through an  arch, which is still standing, the chapel having been converted into a  prebendal house.\"    Richard de London was elected abbot in 1274. He had held several  offices in the monastery before his instalment, and being well  acquainted with the discipline of the church, he governed well and  wisely. He recovered the manor of Biggins, near Oundle, of the Earl of  Clare, and his success was mainly owing to the eloquence of one of his  monks, who pleaded the cause of the monastery in person, before the  judge of assize at Northampton.    It was during the government of Richard de London that Prior Parys  built and endowed the Lady Chapel.[11] This abbot (\"when he was  sacrist\") also built one of the largest steeples of the church, and  gave two bells to the monastery. He died in 1295, having ruled twenty  years. In his reign the library and the monastery lands were increased  considerably.    William de Woodford was next elected abbot. During the latter part of  the rule of Richard, he had assisted him in performing the duties of  abbot, which the latter was unable to do of himself, on account of his  great age.    Swapham informs us that whilst William was abbot, the Pope taxed all  the manors of the abbey.    Woodford is described as a fair and impartial man, of much kindness and  benevolence, who added to the provisions of the monks,--obtained a  charter for the possession of all the deer that might be slain on the  monastery lands, and devoted his attention to the better regulation of  the hospital of St. Leonard.[12] He died after a rule of four years, in  1299, and was succeeded by Godfrey de Croyland in the same year. This  abbot, on his installation, was presented by Prince Edward with a  silver cup, and had the confirmation fees returned to him by the  Bishop's order.    The service in the chapel of Thomas a Becket was for a time suspended  during this abbot's rule, in consequence of a violation of the sanctity  of the place by certain officers, who, being in search of several men  that had transgressed against the laws, and hearing they had taken  shelter in the monastery, dragged them hence by force. The Bishop of  Lincoln therefore put his curse upon the place, nor was it without much  persuasion that he granted an absolution.    The same year, being 1300, says Gunton, \"a marriage being intended  betwixt the heirs of Offord and Southorp, king Edward supposing himself  to be interested therein, appointed inquisition to be made whether the  disposal of that marriage belonged to him or the abbot of _Peterburgh_.  And it being upon the inquisition certified that those heirs and their  progenitors held their lands of the abbey of _Peterburgh_, the right of  disposal of those heirs did therefore belong to the abbot, which the  king, understanding, desisted.\" This right of disposal is well worthy  of notice, as it illustrates the spirit of the time better than a great  deal of writing.    Godfrey was remarkable for his generosity and sumptuous entertainments.  The king and queen, with all their retinues, were provided for at the  monastery, and once Prince Edward came with Peter Gaveston, and the  abbot presented them with two magnificent robes.[13]    Godfrey added many beautiful improvements to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2097"],[0,"The Sign of the Four (#4)"],[1,"revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket.  It  was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one.    Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was  composed, but pale.  She must have been more than woman if she did not  feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were  embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered  the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.    \"Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's,\" she said. \"His  letters were full of allusions to the major.  He and papa were in  command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a  great deal together.  By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's  desk which no one could understand.  I don't suppose that it is of the  slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I  brought it with me.  It is here.\"    Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee.  He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.    \"It is paper of native Indian manufacture,\" he remarked.  \"It has at  some time been pinned to a board.  The diagram upon it appears to be a  plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and  passages.  At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it  is '3.37 from left,' in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner  is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms  touching.  Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters,  'The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan,  Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the  matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance.  It has been kept  carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\"    \"It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\"    \"Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of  use to us.  I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much  deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my  ideas.\"  He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow  and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently.  Miss Morstan and I  chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible  outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until  the end of our journey.    It was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had  been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city.  Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets.  Down the  Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw  a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement.  The yellow glare  from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and  threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare.  There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless  procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of  light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry.  Like all human kind,  they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom  once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy  evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined  to make me nervous and depressed.  I could see from Miss Morstan's  manner that she was suffering from the same feeling.  Holmes alone  could rise superior to petty influences.  He held his open note-book  upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and  memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.    At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the  side-entrances.  In front a continuous stream of hansoms and  four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of  shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women.  We had hardly  reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small,  dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.    \"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\" he asked.    \"I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\" said she.    He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.  \"You will excuse me, miss,\" he said with a certain dogged manner, \"but  I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions  is a police-officer.\"    \"I give you my word on that,\" she answered.    He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a  four-wheeler and opened the door.  The man who had addressed us mounted  to the box, while we took our places inside.  We had hardly done so  before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a  furious pace through the foggy streets.    The situation was a curious one.  We were driving to an unknown place,  on an unknown errand.  Yet our invitation was either a complete  hoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good  reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey.  Miss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever.  I  endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in  Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our  situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were  slightly involved.  To this day she declares that I told her one moving  anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night,  and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it.  At first I had  some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what  with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost  my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very  long way.  Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered  the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous  by-streets.    \"Rochester Row,\" said he.  \"Now Vincent Square.  Now we come out on the  Vauxhall Bridge Road.  We are making for the Surrey side, apparently.  Yes, I thought so.  Now we are on the bridge.  You can catch glimpses  of the river.\"    We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the  lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and  was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.    \"Wordsworth Road,\" said my companion.  \"Priory Road.  Lark Hall Lane.  Stockwell Place.  Robert Street.  Cold Harbor Lane.  Our quest does not  appear to take us to very fashionable regions.\"    We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood.  Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare  and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner.  Then came rows  of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and  then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,--the  monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the  country.  At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace.  None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped  was as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen  window.  On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open  by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting  clothes, and a yellow sash.  There was something strangely incongruous  in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a  third-rate suburban dwelling-house.    \"The Sahib awaits you,\" said he, and even as he spoke there came a high  piping voice from some inner room.  \"Show them in to me, khitmutgar,\"  it cried.  \"Show them straight in to me.\"        Chapter IV    The Story of the Bald-Headed Man    We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and  worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw  open.  A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre  of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle  of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which  shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees.  He writhed  his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual  jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose.  Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow  and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly  passing his hand over the lower part of his face.  In spite of his  obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth.  In point of fact  he had just turned his thirtieth year.    \"Your servant, Miss Morstan,\" he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice.  \"Your servant, gentlemen.  Pray step into my little sanctum.  A small  place, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the  howling desert of South London.\"    We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he  invited us.  In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond  of the first water in a setting of brass.  The richest and glossiest of  curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to  expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase.  The carpet was  of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly  into it, as into a bed of moss.  Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart  it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah  which stood upon a mat in the corner.  A lamp in the fashion of a  silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre  of the room.  As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic  odor.    \"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\" said the little man, still jerking and smiling.  \"That is my name.  You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these  gentlemen--\"    \"This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\"    \"A doctor, eh?\" cried he, much excited.  \"Have you your stethoscope?  Might I ask you--would"]]]
