Not to speak of myself, ask the Cat--he is the most  sensible animal I know--whether he would like to swim, or to plunge to  the bottom of the water. Ask our mistress, the old woman--there is no  one in the world wiser than she. Do you think she would take pleasure  in swimming and in the waters closing over her head?\"    \"You do not understand me,\" said the Duckling.    \"What! we do not understand you? So you think yourself wiser than the  Cat and the old woman, not to speak of myself? Do not fancy any such  thing, child; but be thankful for all the kindness that has been shown  you. Are you not lodged in a warm room, and have you not the advantage  of society from which you can learn something? But you are a simpleton,  and it is wearisome to have anything to do with you. Believe me, I wish  you well. I tell you unpleasant truths, but it is thus that real  friendship is shown. Come, for once give yourself the trouble to  learn to purr, or to lay eggs.\"    \"I think I will go out into the wide world again,\" said the Duckling.    \"Well, go,\" answered the Hen.    So the Duckling went. He swam on the surface of the water, he plunged  beneath, but all animals passed him by, on account of his ugliness. And  the autumn came, the leaves turned yellow and brown, the wind caught  them and danced them about, the air was very cold, the clouds were heavy  with hail or snow, and the Raven sat on the hedge and croaked. The poor  Duckling was certainly not very comfortable.    One evening, just as the sun was setting with unusual brilliancy, a  flock of large, beautiful birds rose from out of the brushwood. The  Duckling had never seen anything so beautiful before; their plumage was  of a dazzling white, and they had long, slender necks. They were Swans.  They uttered a singular cry, spread out their long splendid wings, and  flew away from these cold regions to warmer countries, across the open  sea. They flew so high, so very high! And the little Ugly Duckling's  feelings were so strange. He turned round and round in the water like a  mill-wheel, strained his neck to look after them, and sent forth such a  loud and strange cry that it almost frightened himself. Ah! he could not  forget them, those noble birds, those happy birds! When he could see  them no longer he plunged to the bottom of the water, and when he rose  again was almost beside himself. The Duckling knew not what the birds  were called, knew not whither they were flying; yet he loved them as he  had never before loved anything. He envied them not; it would never have  occurred to him to wish such beauty for himself. He would have been  quite contented if the Ducks in the duck-yard had but endured his  company--the poor, ugly creature.    [Illustration]    And the winter was so cold, so cold, the Duckling was obliged to swim  round and round in the water to keep it from freezing. But every night  the opening in which he swam became smaller and smaller. It froze so  that the crust of ice crackled and the Duckling was obliged to make good  use of his legs to prevent the water from freezing entirely. At last,  wearied out, he lay stiff and cold in the ice.    Early in the morning there passed by a peasant who saw him, broke the  ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and brought him home to his wife.    The poor Duckling soon revived. The children would have played with him,  but he thought they wished to tease him, and in his terror jumped into  the milk-pail, so that the milk was spilled about the room. The good  woman screamed and clapped her hands. He flew from there into the pan  where the butter was kept, and thence into the meal-barrel, and out  again, and then how strange he looked!    The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs, the children ran  races with each other trying to catch him, and laughed and screamed  likewise. It was well for him that the door stood open. He jumped out  among the bushes into the new-fallen snow, and there he lay as in a  dream.    But it would be too sad to tell all the trouble and misery that he had  to suffer from the frost, and snow and storms of the winter. He was  lying on a moor among the reeds, when the sun began to shine warmly  again; the larks sang, and beautiful spring had returned.    Once more he shook his wings. They were stronger than formerly and bore  him forward quickly, and before he was well aware of it he was in a  large garden where the apple-trees stood in full bloom, where the  syringas sent forth their fragrance and hung their long green branches  down into the winding canal. Oh! everything was so lovely, so full of  the freshness of spring! And out of the thicket came three beautiful  white Swans. They displayed their feathers so proudly and swam so  lightly, so lightly! The Duckling knew the glorious creatures, and was  seized with a strange sadness.    \"I will fly to them, those kingly birds!\" said he. \"They will kill me,  because I, ugly as I am, have dared to approach them. But it matters  not. Better to be killed by them than to be bitten by the Ducks, pecked  by the Hens, kicked by the girl who feeds the poultry, and to have so  much to suffer during the winter!\"    [Illustration]    He flew into the water and swam towards the beautiful creatures. They  saw him and shot forward to meet him. \"Only kill me,\" said the poor  creature, and he bowed his head low, expecting death. But what did he  see in the water? He saw beneath him his own form, no longer that of a  plump, ugly grey bird--it was that of a Swan.    It matters not to have been born in a duck-yard, if one has been hatched  from a Swan's egg. And now the Swan began to see the good of all the  trouble he had been through. He would never have known how happy he was  if he had not first had all his sorrow and unhappiness to bear.    The larger Swans swam round him, and stroked him with their beaks. Some  little children were running about in the garden; they threw grain and  bread into the water, and the youngest exclaimed: \"There is a new one!\"  The others also cried out: \"Yes, a new Swan has come!\" and they clapped  their hands, and danced around.    They ran to their father and mother, bread and cake were thrown into  the water, and every one said: \"The new one is best, so young and so  beautiful!\" And the old Swans bowed before him. The young Swan felt  quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wings. He scarcely knew what  to do. He was too happy, but still not proud, for a good heart is never  proud.    He remembered how he had been persecuted and laughed at, and he now  heard everyone say that he was the most beautiful of all beautiful  birds. The syringas bent down their branches toward him low into the  water, and the sun shone warmly and brightly. He shook his feathers,  stretched his slender neck, and in the joy of his heart said: \"How  little did I dream of so much happiness when I was the despised Ugly  Duckling!\"    [Illustration]          ALADDIN AND THE WONDERFUL LAMP    [Illustration]      Aladdin was the only son of a poor widow who lived in China; but instead  of helping his mother to earn their living, he let her do all the hard  work, while he himself only thought of idling and amusement.    One day, as he was playing in the streets, a stranger came up to him,  saying that he was his father's brother, and claiming him as his  long-lost nephew. Aladdin had never heard that his father had had a  brother; but as the stranger gave him money and promised to buy him  fine clothes and set him up in business, he was quite ready to believe  all that he told him. The man was a magician, who wanted to use Aladdin  for his own purposes.    [Illustration]    The next day the stranger came again, brought Aladdin a beautiful suit  of clothes, gave him many good things to eat, and took him for a long  walk, telling him stories all the while to amuse him. After they had  walked a long way, they came to a narrow valley, bounded on either side  by tall, gloomy-looking mountains. Aladdin was beginning to feel tired,  and he did not like the look of this place at all. He wanted to turn  back; but the stranger would not let him. He made Aladdin follow him  still farther, until at length they reached the place where he intended  to carry out his evil design. Then he made Aladdin gather sticks to make  a fire, and when they were in a blaze he threw into them some powder,  at the same time saying some mystical words, which Aladdin could not  understand.    Immediately they were surrounded with a thick cloud of smoke. The earth  trembled, and burst open at their feet--disclosing a large flat stone  with a brass ring fixed in it. Aladdin was so terribly frightened that  he was about to run away; but the Magician gave him such a blow on the  ear that he fell to the ground.    Poor Aladdin rose to his feet with eyes full of tears, and said,  reproachfully--    \"Uncle, what have I done that you should treat me so?\"    \"You should not have tried to run away from me,\" said the Magician,  \"when I have brought you here only for your own advantage. Under this  stone there is hidden a treasure which will make you richer than the  richest monarch in the world. You alone may touch it. If I assist you  in any way the spell will be broken, but if you obey me faithfully, we  shall both be rich for the rest of our lives. Come, take hold of the  brass ring and lift the stone.\"    Aladdin forgot his fears in the hope of gaining this wonderful treasure,  and took hold of the brass ring. It yielded at once to his touch, and he  was able to lift the great stone quite easily and move it away, which  disclosed a flight of steps, leading down into the ground.    \"Go down these steps,\" commanded the Magician, \"and at the bottom you  will find a great cavern, divided into three halls, full of vessels of  gold and silver; but "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20750"],[0,"Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society - Vol. 3 (#4)"],[1," angular and  with a yellow border; the scutellum prominent, covered on each side with  a dense silvery-white pile, the postscutellum with two spots of the  same; the wings flavo-hyaline, their apex with a broad dark-fuscous  border, the nervures ferruginous, the tegulae yellow; the posterior wings  palest; legs pale ferruginous, the coxae black with their tips pale; the  apical joints of the tarsi blackish, the spines of the legs black.
