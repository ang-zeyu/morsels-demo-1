There, among the outcasts of our good Christian  society, she could at least rent a bit of a room, and find rest and  work at her sewing machine.  The women of the street showed more  refinement of feeling and sincere sympathy than the priests of the  Church.  But human endurance had been exhausted by overmuch suffering  and privation.  There was a complete physical breakdown, and the  renowned agitator was removed to the \"Bohemian Republic\"--a large  tenement house which derived its euphonious appellation from the fact  that its occupants were mostly Bohemian Anarchists.  Here Emma  Goldman found friends ready to aid her.  Justus Schwab, one of the  finest representatives of the German revolutionary period of that  time, and Dr. Solotaroff were indefatigable in the care of the  patient.  Here, too, she met Edward Brady, the new friendship  subsequently ripening into close intimacy.  Brady had been an active  participant in the revolutionary movement of Austria and had, at the  time of his acquaintance with Emma Goldman, lately been released from  an Austrian prison after an incarceration of ten years.    Physicians diagnosed the illness as consumption, and the patient was  advised to leave New York.  She went to Rochester, in the hope that  the home circle would help restore her to health.  Her parents had  several years previously emigrated to America, settling in that city.  Among the leading traits of the Jewish race is the strong attachment  between the members of the family, and, especially, between parents  and children.  Though her conservative parents could not sympathize  with the idealist aspirations of Emma Goldman and did not approve of  her mode of life, they now received their sick daughter with open  arms.  The rest and care enjoyed in the parental home, and the  cheering presence of the beloved sister Helene, proved so beneficial  that within a short time she was sufficiently restored to resume her  energetic activity.    There is no rest in the life of Emma Goldman.  Ceaseless effort and  continuous striving toward the conceived goal are the essentials of  her nature.  Too much precious time had already been wasted.  It was  imperative to resume her labors immediately.  The country was in the  throes of a crisis, and thousands of unemployed crowded the streets  of the large industrial centers.  Cold and hungry they tramped  through the land in the vain search for work and bread.  The  Anarchists developed a strenuous propaganda among the unemployed and  the strikers.  A monster demonstration of striking cloakmakers and of  the unemployed took place at Union Square, New York.  Emma Goldman  was one of the invited speakers.  She delivered an impassioned  speech, picturing in fiery words the misery of the wage slave's life,  and quoted the famous maxim of Cardinal Manning: \"Necessity knows no  law, and the starving man has a natural right to a share of his  neighbor's bread.\"  She concluded her exhortation with the words:  \"Ask for work.  If they do not give you work, ask for bread.  If they  do not give you work or bread, then take bread.\"    The following day she left for Philadelphia, where she was to address  a public meeting.  The capitalist press again raised the alarm.  If  Socialists and Anarchists were to be permitted to continue agitating,  there was imminent danger that the workingmen would soon learn to  understand the manner in which they are robbed of the joy and  happiness of life.  Such a possibility was to be prevented at all  cost.  The Chief of Police of New York, Byrnes, procured a court  order for the arrest of Emma Goldman.  She was detained by the  Philadelphia authorities and incarcerated for several days in the  Moyamensing prison, awaiting the extradition papers which Byrnes  intrusted to Detective Jacobs.  This man Jacobs (whom Emma Goldman  again met several years later under very unpleasant circumstances)  proposed to her, while she was returning a prisoner to New York, to  betray the cause of labor.  In the name of his superior, Chief  Byrnes, he offered lucrative reward.  How stupid men sometimes are!  What poverty of psychologic observation to imagine the possibility of  betrayal on the part of a young Russian idealist, who had willingly  sacrificed all personal considerations to help in labor's  emancipation.    In October, 1893, Emma Goldman was tried in the criminal courts of  New York on the charge of inciting to riot.  The \"intelligent\" jury  ignored the testimony of the twelve witnesses for the defense in  favor of the evidence given by one single man--Detective Jacobs.  She  was found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in the penitentiary  at Blackwell's Island.  Since the foundation of the Republic she was  the first woman--Mrs. Surratt excepted--to be imprisoned for a  political offense.  Respectable society had long before stamped upon  her the Scarlet Letter.    Emma Goldman passed her time in the penitentiary in the capacity of  nurse in the prison hospital.  Here she found opportunity to shed  some rays of kindness into the dark lives of the unfortunates whose  sisters of the street did not disdain two years previously to share  with her the same house.  She also found in prison opportunity to  study English and its literature, and to familiarize herself with the  great American writers.  In Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman,  Thoreau, and Emerson she found great treasures.    She left Blackwell's Island in the month of August, 1894, a woman of  twenty-five, developed and matured, and intellectually transformed.  Back into the arena, richer in experience, purified by suffering.  She did not feel herself deserted and alone any more.  Many hands  were stretched out to welcome her.  There were at the time numerous  intellectual oases in New York.  The saloon of Justus Schwab, at  Number Fifty, First Street, was the center where gathered Anarchists,  litterateurs, and bohemians.  Among others she also met at this time  a number of American Anarchists, and formed the friendship of  Voltairine de Cleyre, Wm. C. Owen, Miss Van Etton, and Dyer D. Lum,  former editor of the ALARM and executor of the last wishes of the  Chicago martyrs.  In John Swinton, the noble old fighter for liberty,  she found one of her staunchest friends.  Other intellectual centers  there were: SOLIDARITY, published by John Edelman; LIBERTY, by the  Individualist Anarchist, Benjamin R. Tucker; the REBEL, by Harry  Kelly; DER STURMVOGEL, a German Anarchist publication, edited by  Claus Timmermann; DER ARME TEUFEL, whose presiding genius was the  inimitable Robert Reitzel.  Through Arthur Brisbane, now chief  lieutenant of William Randolph Hearst, she became acquainted with the  writings of Fourier.  Brisbane then was not yet submerged in the  swamp of political corruption.  He sent Emma Goldman an amiable  letter to Blackwell's Island, together with the biography of his  father, the enthusiastic American disciple of Fourier.    Emma Goldman became, upon her release from the penitentiary, a factor  in the public life of New York.  She was appreciated in radical ranks  for her devotion, her idealism, and earnestness.  Various persons  sought her friendship, and some tried to persuade her to aid in the  furtherance of their special side issues.  Thus Rev. Parkhurst,  during the Lexow investigation, did his utmost to induce her to join  the Vigilance Committee in order to fight Tammany Hall.  Maria  Louise, the moving spirit of a social center, acted as Parkhurst's  go-between.  It is hardly necessary to mention what reply the latter  received from Emma Goldman.  Incidentally, Maria Louise subsequently  became a Mahatma.  During the free silver campaign, ex-Burgess  McLuckie, one of the most genuine personalities in the Homestead  strike, visited New York in an endeavor to enthuse the local radicals  for free silver.  He also attempted to interest Emma Goldman, but  with no greater success than Mahatma Maria Louise of Parkhurst-Lexow  fame.      In 1894 the struggle of the Anarchists in France reached its highest  expression.  The white terror on the part of the Republican upstarts  was answered by the red terror of our French comrades.  With feverish  anxiety the Anarchists throughout the world followed this social  struggle.  Propaganda by deed found its reverberating echo in almost  all countries.  In order to better familiarize herself with  conditions in the old world, Emma Goldman left for Europe, in the  year 1895.  After a lecture tour in England and Scotland, she went to  Vienna where she entered the ALLGEMEINE KRANKENHAUS to prepare  herself as midwife and nurse, and where at the same time she studied  social conditions.  She also found opportunity to acquaint herself  with the newest literature of Europe: Hauptmann, Nietzsche, Ibsen,  Zola, Thomas Hardy, and other artist rebels were read with great  enthusiasm.    In the autumn of 1896 she returned to New York by way of Zurich and  Paris.  The project of Alexander Berkman's liberation was on hand.  The barbaric sentence of twenty-two years had roused tremendous  indignation among the radical elements.  It was known that the Pardon  Board of Pennsylvania would look to Carnegie and Frick for advice in  the case of Alexander Berkman.  It was therefore suggested that these  Sultans of Pennsylvania be approached--not with a view of obtaining  their grace, but with the request that they do not attempt to  influence the Board.  Ernest Crosby offered to see Carnegie, on  condition that Alexander Berkman repudiate his act.  That, however,  was absolutely out of the question.  He would never be guilty of such  forswearing of his own personality and self-respect.  These efforts  led to friendly relations between Emma Goldman and the circle of  Ernest Crosby, Bolton Hall, and Leonard Abbott.  In the year 1897 she  undertook her first great"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21630"],[0,"Bibliomania in the Middle Ages (#4)"],[1,"Paget, Secretary, he  writes that the proclamation for burning books had been the occasion of  much hurt. \"For New Testaments and Bibles (not condemned by proclamation)  have been burned, and that, out of parish churches and good men's houses.  They have burned innumerable of the king's majesties books concerning our  religion lately set forth.\"[12] The ignorant thus delighted to destroy  that which they did not understand, and the factional spirit of the more  enlightened would not allow them to make one effort for the preservation  of those valuable relics of early English literature, which crowded the  shelves of the monastic libraries; the sign of the cross, the use of red  letters on the title page, the illuminations representing saints, or the  diagrams and circles of a mathematical nature, were at all times deemed  sufficient evidence of their popish origin and fitness for the  flames.[13]    When we consider the immense number of MSS. thus destroyed, we cannot  help suspecting that, if they had been carefully preserved and examined,  many valuable and original records would have been discovered. The  catalogues of old monastic establishments, although containing a great  proportion of works on divine and ecclesiastical learning, testify that  the monks did not confine their studies exclusively to legendary tales or  superstitious missals, but that they also cultivated a taste for  classical and general learning. Doubtless, in the ruin of the sixteenth  century, many original works of monkish authors perished, and the  splendor of the transcript rendered it still more liable to destruction;  but I confess, as old Fuller quaintly says, that \"there were many volumes  full fraught with superstition which, notwithstanding, might be useful to  learned men, except any will deny apothecaries the privilege of keeping  poison in their shops, when they can make antidotes of them. But besides  this, what beautiful bibles! Rare fathers! Subtle schoolmen! Useful  historians! Ancient! Middle! Modern! What painful comments were here  amongst them! What monuments of mathematics all massacred together!\"[14]    More than a cart load of manuscripts were taken away from Merton College  and destroyed, and a vast number from the Baliol and New Colleges,  Oxford;[15] but these instances might be infinitely multiplied, so  terrible were those intemperate outrages. All this tends to enforce upon  us the necessity of using considerable caution in forming an opinion of  the nature and extent of learning prevalent during those ages which  preceded the discovery of the art of printing.    FOOTNOTES:    [7] The sad page in the Annals of Literary History recording the      destruction of books and MSS. fully prove this assertion. In France,      in the year 1790, 4,194,000 volumes were burnt belonging to the      suppressed monasteries, about 25,000 of these were manuscripts.

The persons are not named, but the business was to cull out all      superstitious books, as missals, legends, and such like, and to      deliver the garniture of the books, being either gold or silver, to      Sir Anthony Aucher. These books were many of them plated with gold      and silver and curiously embossed. This, as far as we can collect,      was the superstition that destroyed them.

The monotonous habits of a cloistered bibliophile will,  perhaps, appear dry and fastidious, but still it is curious and  interesting to observe how carefully the monks regarded their vellum  tomes, how indefatigably they worked to increase their stores, and how  eagerly they sought for books. But besides being regarded as a literary  curiosity, the subject derives importance by the light it throws on the  state of learning in those dark and \"bookless\" days, and the  illustrations gleaned in this way fully compensate for the tediousness of  the research.    As a bibliophile it is somewhat pleasing to trace a deep book passion  growing up in the barrenness of the cloister, and to find in some cowled  monk a bibliomaniac as warm and enthusiastic in his way as the renowned  \"Atticus,\" or the noble Roxburghe, of more recent times. It is true we  can draw no comparison between the result of their respective labors. The  hundreds, which in the old time were deemed a respectable if not an  extensive collection, would look insignificant beside the ostentatious  array of modern libraries.    But the very tenor of a monastic life compelled the monk to seek the  sweet yet silent companionship of books; the rules of his order and the  regulations of his fraternity enforced the strictest silence in the  execution of his daily and never-ceasing duties. Attending mass, singing  psalms, and midnight prayers, were succeeded by mass, psalms and prayers  in one long undeviating round of yearly obligations; the hours  intervening between these holy exercises were dull and tediously  insupportable if unoccupied. Conversation forbidden, secular amusements  denounced, yet idleness reproached, what could the poor monk seek as a  relief in this distress but the friendly book; the willing and obedient  companion of every one doomed to lonely hours and dismal solitude?    The pride and glory of a monastery was a well stored library, which was  committed to the care of the armarian, and with him rested all the  responsibility of its preservation. According to the Consuetudines  Canonicorum Regularium, it was his duty to have all the books of the  monastery in his keeping catalogued and separately marked with their  proper names.[16] Some of these old catalogues have been preserved, and,  viewed as bibliographical remains of the middle ages, are of considerable  importance; indeed, we cannot form a correct idea of the literature of  those remote times without them. Many productions of authors are recorded  in these brief catalogues whose former existence is only known to us by  these means. There is one circumstance in connexion with them that must  not be forgotten: instead of enumerating all the works which each volume  contained, they merely specified the first, so that a catalogue of fifty  or a hundred volumes might probably have contained nearly double that  number of distinct works. I have seen MSS. formerly belonging to  monasteries, which have been catalogued in this way, containing four or  five others, besides the one mentioned. Designed rather to identify the  book than to describe the contents of each volume, they wrote down the  first word or two of the second leaf--this was the most prevalent usage;  but they often adopted other means, sometimes giving a slight notice of  the works which a volume contained; others took the precaution of noting  down the last word of the last leaf but one,[17] a great advantage, as  the monkish student could more easily detect at a glance whether the  volume was perfect. The armarian was, moreover, particularly enjoined to  inspect with scrupulous care the more ancient volumes, lest the  moth-worms should have got at them, or they had become corrupt or  mutilated, and, if such were the case, he was with great care to restore  them. Probably the armarian was also the bookbinder to the monastery in  ordinary cases, for he is here directed to cover the volumes with tablets  of wood, that the inside may be preserved from moisture, and the  parchment from the injurious effects of dampness. The different orders of  books were to be kept separate from one another, and"]]]
