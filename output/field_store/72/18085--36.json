Next in rank are those eminent and honorable ministers of state and  representatives, who place the will of God above their own, and whose  administrative skill and wisdom in the conduct of their office raises the  science            [PAGES 21-40]      of government to new heights of perfection. They shine in the learned  world like lamps of knowledge; their thinking, their attitudes and their  acts demonstrate their patriotism and their concern for the country's  advancement. Content with a modest stipend, they consecrate their days and  nights to the execution of important duties and the devising of methods to  insure the progress of the people. Through the effectiveness of their wise  counsel, the soundness of their judgment, they have ever caused their  government to become an example to be followed by all the governments of  the world. They have made their capital city a focal center of great world  undertakings, they have won distinction, attaining a supreme degree of  personal eminence, and reaching the loftiest heights of repute and  character.    Again, there are those famed and accomplished men of learning, possessed  of praiseworthy qualities and vast erudition, who lay hold on the strong  handle of the fear of God and keep to the ways of salvation. In the mirror  of their minds the forms of transcendent realities are reflected, and the  lamp of their inner vision derives its light from the sun of universal  knowledge. They are busy by night and by day with meticulous research into  such sciences as are profitable to mankind, and they devote themselves to  the training of students of capacity. It is certain that to their  discerning taste, the proffered treasures of kings would not compare with  a single drop of the waters of knowledge, and mountains of gold and silver  could not outweigh the successful solution of a difficult problem. To  them, the delights that lie outside their work are only toys for children,  and the cumbersome load of unnecessary possessions is only good for the  ignorant and base. Content, like the birds, they give thanks for a handful  of seeds, and the song of their wisdom dazzles the minds of the world's  most wise.    Again, there are sagacious leaders among the people and influential  personalities throughout the country, who constitute the pillars of state.  Their rank and station and success depend on their being the well-wishers  of the people and in their seeking out such means as will improve the  nation and will increase the wealth and comfort of the citizens.    Observe the case when an individual is an eminent person in his country,  zealous, wise, pure-hearted, known for his innate capacity, intelligence,  natural perspicacity--and is also an important member of the state: what,  for such an individual, can be regarded as honor, abiding happiness, rank  and station, whether in the here or the hereafter? Is it a diligent  attention to truth and righteousness, is it dedication and resolve and  devotion to the good pleasure of God, is it the desire to attract the  favorable consideration of the ruler and to merit the approval of the  people? Or would it, rather, consist in this, that for the sake of  indulging in feasts and dissipations by night he should undermine his  country and break the hearts of his people by day, causing his God to  reject him, and his sovereign to cast him out and his people to defame him  and hold him in deserved contempt? By God, the mouldering bones in the  graveyard are better than such as these! Of what value are they, who have  never tasted the heavenly food of truly human qualities, and never drunk  of the crystalline waters of those bounties which belong to the realm of  man?    It is unquestionable that the object in establishing parliaments is to  bring about justice and righteousness, but everything hinges on the  efforts of the elected representatives. If their intention is sincere,  desirable results and unforeseen improvements will be forthcoming; if not,  it is certain that the whole thing will be meaningless, the country will  come to a standstill and public affairs will continuously deteriorate. \"I  see a thousand builders unequal to one subverter; what then of the one  builder who is followed by a thousand subverters?\"    The purpose of the foregoing statements is to demonstrate at least this,  that the happiness and greatness, the rank and station, the pleasure and  peace, of an individual have never consisted in his personal wealth, but  rather in his excellent character, his high resolve, the breadth of his  learning, and his ability to solve difficult problems. How well has it  been said: \"On my back is a garment which, were it sold for a penny, that  penny would be worth far more; yet within the garment is a soul which, if  you weighed it against all the souls in the world, would prove greater and  nobler.\"    In the present writer's view it would be preferable if the election of  nonpermanent members of consultative assemblies in sovereign states should  be dependent on the will and choice of the people. For elected  representatives will on this account be somewhat inclined to exercise  justice, lest their reputation suffer and they fall into disfavor with the  public.    It should not be imagined that the writer's earlier remarks constitute a  denunciation of wealth or a commendation of poverty. Wealth is  praiseworthy in the highest degree, if it is acquired by an individual's  own efforts and the grace of God, in commerce, agriculture, art and  industry, and if it be expended for philanthropic purposes. Above all, if  a judicious and resourceful individual should initiate measures which  would universally enrich the masses of the people, there could be no  undertaking greater than this, and it would rank in the sight of God as  the supreme achievement, for such a benefactor would supply the needs and  insure the comfort and well-being of a great multitude. Wealth is most  commendable, provided the entire population is wealthy. If, however, a few  have inordinate riches while the rest are impoverished, and no fruit or  benefit accrues from that wealth, then it is only a liability to its  possessor. If, on the other hand, it is expended for the promotion of  knowledge, the founding of elementary and other schools, the encouragement  of art and industry, the training of orphans and the poor--in brief, if it  is dedicated to the welfare of society--its possessor will stand out before  God and man as the most excellent of all who live on earth and will be  accounted as one of the people of paradise.    As to those who maintain that the inauguration of reforms and the setting  up of powerful institutions would in reality be at variance with the good  pleasure of God and would contravene the laws of the Divine Law-Giver and  run counter to basic religious principles and to the ways of the  Prophet--let them consider how this could be the case. Would such reforms  contravene the religious law because they would be acquired from  foreigners and would therefore cause us to be as they are, since \"He who  imitates a people is one of them\"? In the first place these matters relate  to the temporal and material apparatus of civilization, the implements of  science, the adjuncts of progress in the professions and the arts, and the  orderly conduct of government. They have nothing whatever to do with the  problems of the spirit and the complex realities of religious doctrine. If  it be objected that even where material affairs are concerned foreign  importations are inadmissible, such an argument would only establish the  ignorance and absurdity of its proponents. Have they forgotten the  celebrated hadi_th_ (Holy Tradition): \"Seek after knowledge, even unto  China\"? It is certain that the people of China were, in the sight of God,  among the most rejected of men, because they worshiped idols and were  unmindful of the omniscient Lord. The Europeans are at least \"Peoples of  the Book,\" and believers in God and specifically referred to in the sacred  verse, \"Thou shalt certainly find those to be nearest in affection to the  believers, who say, 'We are Christians.'\"(13) It is therefore quite  permissible and indeed more appropriate to acquire knowledge from  Christian countries. How could seeking after knowledge among the heathen  be acceptable to God, and seeking it among the People of the Book be  repugnant to Him?    Furthermore, in the Battle of the Confederates, Abu Sufyan enlisted the  aid of the Bani Kinanih, the Bani Qahtan and the Jewish Bani Qurayzih and  rose up with all the tribes of the Quray_sh_ to put out the Divine Light  that flamed in the lamp of Ya_th_rib (Medina). In those days the great  winds of trials and tribulations were blowing from every direction, as it  is written: \"Do men think when they say 'We believe' they shall be let  alone and not be put to proof?\"(14) The believers were few and the enemy  attacking in force, seeking to blot out the new-risen Sun of Truth with  the dust of oppression and tyranny. Then Salman (the Persian) came into  the presence of the Prophet--the Dawning-Point of revelation, the Focus of  the endless splendors of grace--and he said that in Persia to protect  themselves from an encroaching host they would dig a moat or trench about  their lands, and that this had proved a highly efficient safeguard against  surprise attacks. Did that Wellspring of universal wisdom, that Mine of  divine knowledge say in reply that this was a custom current among  idolatrous, fire-worshiping Magians and could therefore hardly be adopted  by monotheists? Or did He rather immediately direct His followers to set  about digging a trench? He even, in His Own blessed person, took hold of  the tools and went to work beside them.    It is moreover a matter of record in the books of the various Islamic  schools and the writings of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19238"],[0,"Foundations of World Unity (#4)"],[1,"and agitation of the human  world today because of war. Peace is health and construction; war is  disease and dissolution. When the banner of truth is raised, peace becomes  the cause of the welfare and advancement of the human world. In all cycles  and ages war has been a factor of derangement and discomfort whereas peace  and brotherhood have brought security and consideration of human  interests. This distinction is especially pronounced in the present world  conditions, for warfare in former centuries had not attained the degree of  savagery and destructiveness which now characterizes it. If two nations  were at war in olden times, ten or twenty thousand would be sacrificed but  in this century the destruction of one hundred thousand lives in a day is  quite possible. So perfected has the science of killing become and so  efficient the means and instruments of its accomplishment that a whole  nation can be obliterated in a short time. Therefore comparison with the  methods and results of ancient warfare is out of the question.    According to an intrinsic law, all phenomena of being attain to a summit  and degree of consummation, after which a new order and condition is  established. As the instruments and science of war have reached the degree  of thoroughness and proficiency, it is hoped that the transformation of  the human world is at hand and that in the coming centuries all the  energies and inventions of man will be utilized in promoting the interests  of peace and brotherhood. Therefore may this esteemed and worthy society  for the establishment of international peace(2) be confirmed in its  sincere intentions and empowered by God. Then will it hasten the time when  the banner of universal agreement will be raised and international welfare  will be proclaimed and consummated so that the darkness which now  encompasses the world shall pass away....    The powers of earth cannot withstand the privileges and bestowals which  God has ordained for this great and glorious century. It is a need and  exigency of the time. Man can withstand anything except that which is  divinely intended and indicated for the age and its requirements. Now,  Praise be to God! in all countries of the world, lovers of peace are to be  found and these principles are being spread among mankind, especially in  this country. Praise be to God! this thought is prevailing and souls are  continually arising as defenders of the oneness of humanity, endeavoring  to assist and establish international peace. There is no doubt that this  wonderful democracy will be able to realize it and the banner of  international agreement will be unfurled here to spread onward and outward  among all the nations of the world. I give thanks to God that I find you  imbued with such susceptibilities and lofty aspirations and I hope that  you will be the means of spreading this light to all men. Thus may the Sun  of Reality shine upon the East and West. The enveloping clouds shall pass  away and the heat of the divine rays will dispel the mist. The reality of  man shall develop and come forth as the image of God his creator. The  thoughts of man shall take such upward flight that former accomplishments  shall appear as the play of children;--for the ideas and beliefs of the  past and the prejudices regarding race and religion have ever been  lowering and destructive to human evolution. I am most hopeful that in  this century these lofty thoughts shall be conducive to human welfare. Let  this century be the sun of previous centuries the effulgences of which  shall last forever, so that in times to come they shall glorify the  twentieth century, saying the twentieth century was the century of lights,  the twentieth century was the century of life, the twentieth century was  the century of international peace, the twentieth century was the century  of divine bestowals and the twentieth century has left traces which shall  last forever.            THE PROPHETS AND WAR      When we review history from the beginning down to the present day we find  that strife and warfare have prevailed throughout the human world. Wars,  religious, racial or political, have arisen from human ignorance,  misunderstanding and lack of education. We will first consider religious  strife and conflict.    It is evident that the divine prophets have appeared in the world to  establish love and agreement among mankind. They have been the shepherds  and not the wolves. The shepherd comes forth to gather and lead his flock  and not to disperse them by creating strife. Every divine shepherd has  assembled a flock which had formerly been scattered. Among the shepherds  was His Holiness Moses. At a time when the tribes of Israel were wandering  and dispersed, he assembled, united and educated them to higher degrees of  capacity and progress until they passed out of the wilderness of  discipline into the holy land of possession. He transformed their  degradation into glory, changed their poverty into wealth and replaced  their vices by virtues until they rose to such a zenith that the splendor  of the sovereignty of Solomon was made possible and the fame of their  civilization extended to the East and the West. It is evident therefore  that His Holiness was a divine shepherd for he gathered the tribes of  Israel together and united them in the power and strength of a great  nationhood.    When the Messianic star of Jesus Christ dawned, he declared he had come to  gather together the lost tribes or scattered sheep of Moses. He not only  shepherded the flock of Israel, but brought together people of Chaldea,  Egypt, Syria, ancient Assyria and Phoenicia. These people were in a state  of utmost hostility, thirsting for the blood of each other with the  ferocity of animals; but His Holiness Jesus Christ brought them together,  cemented and united them in his cause and established such a bond of love  among them that enmity and warfare were abandoned. It is evident therefore  that the divine teachings are intended to create a bond of unity in the  human world and establish the foundations of love and fellowship among  mankind. Divine religion is not a cause for discord and disagreement. If  religion becomes the source of antagonism and strife, the absence of  religion is to be preferred. Religion is meant to be the quickening life  of the body politic; if it be the cause of death to humanity, its  nonexistence would be a blessing and benefit to man. Therefore in this day  the divine teachings must be sought, for they are the remedies for the  present conditions of the world of humanity.    At a time when the Arabian tribes and nomadic peoples were widely  separated, living in the deserts under lawless conditions, strife and  bloodshed continual among them, no tribe free from the menace of attack  and destruction by another,--at such a critical time Mohammed appeared. He  gathered these wild tribes of the desert together, reconciled, united and  caused them to agree so that enmity and warfare ceased. The Arabian nation  immediately advanced until its dominion extended westward to Spain and  Andalusia.    From these facts and premises we may conclude that the establishing of the  divine religions is for peace, not for war and the shedding of blood.  Inasmuch as all are founded upon one reality which is love and unity, the  wars and dissensions which have characterized the history of religion have  been due to imitations and superstitions which arise afterward. Religion  is reality and reality is one. The fundamentals of the religion of God are  therefore one in reality. There is neither difference nor change in the  fundamentals. Variance is caused by blind imitations, prejudices and  adherence to forms which appear later, and inasmuch as these differ,  discord and strife result. If the religions of the world would forsake  these causes of difficulty and seek the fundamentals, all would agree, and  strife and dissension would pass away; for religion and reality are one  and not multiple.    Other wars are caused by purely imaginary racial differences; for humanity  is one kind, one race and progeny inhabiting the same globe. In the  creative plan there is no racial distinction and separation such as  Frenchman, Englishman, American, German, Italian or Spaniard; all belong  to one household. These boundaries and distinctions are human and  artificial, not natural and original. All mankind are the fruits of one  tree, flowers of the same garden, waves of one sea. In the animal kingdom  no such distinction and separation are observed. The sheep of the East and  the sheep of the West would associate peacefully. The oriental flock would  not look surprised as if saying, \"These are sheep of the Occident; they do  not belong to our country.\" All would gather in harmony and enjoy the same  pasture without evidence of local or racial distinction. The birds of  different countries mingle in friendliness. We find these virtues in the  animal kingdom. Shall man deprive himself of these virtues? Man is endowed  with superior reasoning power and the faculty of perception; he is the  manifestation of divine bestowals. Shall racial ideas prevail and obscure  the creative purpose of unity in his kingdom? Shall he say, \"I am a  German,\" \"I am a Frenchman,\" or an \"Englishman\" and declare war because of  this imaginary and human distinction? God forbid! This earth is one  household and the nativity of all humanity; therefore the human race  should ignore distinctions and boundaries which are artificial and  conducive to disagreement and hostility. We have come from the East.  Praise be to God! we find this continent prosperous, the climate  salubrious and delightful, the inhabitants genial and courteous, the  government equable and just. Shall we entertain any other thought and  feeling than that of love for you? Shall we say, \"This is not our native  land, therefore everything is objectionable?\" This would "]]]
