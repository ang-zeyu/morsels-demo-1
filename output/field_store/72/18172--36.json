But the ordinary Greek believed that the gods actually existed in human  form, and even that their characters and passions and moods were like  those of human beings. The influence of the poet and the artist could  not have been so vigorous if it had not found, in the imagination of the  people, a suitable and sympathetic material.    (2) Official or state religion consisted in the main of an organisation  of popular ritual. There was no priestcraft in Greece, no exclusive  caste to whom the worship of the gods was assigned, although, of course,  the right to practise certain cults belonged to particular families. But  a priesthood, as a rule, was a political office like any other  magistracy, and there was no exclusive tradition in the case of the  chief cults of any Greek state to keep the point of view of the priests  different from that of the people generally. The tendency of state  religion was, as a rule, conservative, for reasons that we have already  noticed; innovations in the matter of ritual are dangerous, for the new  rite may not please the gods as well as the old; and the same feeling  applies to the statues that form the centres of ritual. Pericles, for  example, doubtless wished to make the Athena Parthenos of Phidias the  official and visible representation of the goddess of Athens, and  thereby to raise the religious ideals of the Athenians. In this last  part of his attempt he was successful; the statue became the pride and  glory of the city in its fitting shrine, the Parthenon; but the old  image was still preserved in the temple of Athena Polias, and remained  the official centre of worship. We are not told that Pericles meant to  supersede it; but it is very probable that he intended to do so, and was  only prevented by the religious conservatism that curtailed other plans  of his for the beautifying of the Acropolis. On the other hand, there is  no evidence that in Greece--at least, in the best period of Greek  art--any statesman held the views as to the official religion frankly  expressed in Rome, that it was expedient for this religion to be  accepted by the common people, but that educated men could only  reconcile their consciences to taking part in it by a philosophical  interpretation.    There is something unreal and artificial about any such compromise. If  Pericles was intimate with Anaxagoras, who was prosecuted for atheism,  he was also the friend of Phidias, who expressly said that his Zeus was  the Zeus of Homer, no mere abstract ideal of divinity. If this was the  case with Pericles, who held himself aloof from the common people, it  must have been much more so with other statesmen, who mingled with them  more freely, or even, like Nicias, shared their superstitions. Under  such conditions the influence of art upon the representations of the  gods could not well go in advance of popular conceptions, though it  might accompany and direct them. The making of new statues of the gods,  to be set up as the centres of worship in their temples, in some cases  received the formal sanction of the Delphic oracle, the highest official  and religious authority. Public commissions of this sort are common at  all times, but commonest in the years immediately succeeding the Persian  Wars, when the spoils of the Persians supplied ample resources, and in  many cases the ancient temples and images had been destroyed; and at the  same time the outburst of national enthusiasm over the great deliverance  led to a desire to give due thank-offerings to the gods of the Hellenic  race, a desire which coincided with the ability to fulfil it, owing to  the rapid progress of artistic power. Such public commissions, and the  popular feeling which they expressed, offered an inspiration to the  artist such as has rarely, if ever, found a parallel. But any great  victory or deliverance might be commemorated by the setting up of  statues of the gods to whom it was attributed; and in this way the  demands of official religion offered the sculptor the highest scope for  the exercise of his art and his imagination.    (3) The influence of poetic mythology upon art can hardly be  exaggerated. The statement of Herodotus that Homer and Hesiod \"made the  Greek theogony, and assigned to the gods their epithets and  distinguished their prerogatives and their functions, and indicated  their form,\" would not, of course, be accepted in a literal sense by any  modern mythologist. But it is nevertheless true that the clear and vivid  personality and individuality given to the gods by the epic poets  affects all later poetry and all Greek art. The imagination of the poets  could not, as we have already noticed, have had so deep and wide an  influence unless it had been based upon popular beliefs and conceptions.  But it fills these conceptions with real and vivid character, so that  the gods of Homer are as clearly presented to us as any personalities of  history or fiction. They are, indeed, endowed not only with the form,  but with the passions, and some even of the weaknesses of mankind; and  for this reason the philosophers often rejected as unworthy the tales  that the poets told of the gods. But even an artist such as Phidias  expressly stated that it was the Zeus of Homer who inspired his greatest  work, quoting the well-known passage in the Iliad in which the god  grants the prayer of Thetis:--      \"He said; and his black eyebrows bent; above his deathless head     Th' ambrosian curls flowed; great heaven shook.\"    Descriptive passages such as this are not, indeed, common, because, as  Lessing clearly pointed out, the poet depends more upon action and its  effect than on mere enumerative description. Even here it is the action  of the nod, and the shaking of heaven that follows it, that emphasises  the impression, rather than the mere mention of eyebrows or hair. In  many other cases the distinctive epithet has its value for all later  art--the cow-eyed Hera, the grey-eyed Athena, the swift messenger  Hermes; but, above all, it is the action and character of the various  gods that is so clearly realised by the poet that his successors cannot,  if they wish, escape from his spell.    The influence of the various Greek poets is not, indeed, for the most  part, to be traced in contemporary Greek art. This is obvious in the  case of the Homeric poems, for the art of the time was of a purely  decorative character, and was quite incapable of representing in any  adequate way the vivid and lively imagination of the poets; and, for  that matter, for many centuries after the date of the composition of the  Iliad and Odyssey, Hellenic art made no attempt to cope with any so  ambitious problems. Even when the art of sculpture had attained to a  considerable degree of mastery over material and expression, we find its  aims and conceptions lagging far behind those of the poet. This will  become clearer when, in the next chapter, we consider the conditions of  artistic expression in Greece; but it must be noted here, in order to  prevent possible misconception. As soon, however, as art became capable  of aiming at something beyond perfection of a bodily form--a change  which, in spite of Pausanias' admiration of something divine about the  works of Daedalus, can hardly be dated earlier than the fifth century  B.C.--the Homeric conceptions of the gods came to have their full  effect. Zeus, the king and father of gods and men; Athena, the friendly  protectress of heroes, irresistible in war, giver of all intellectual  and artistic power; Apollo, the archer and musician, the purifier and  soothsayer--these and others find their first visible embodiment in the  statues whereby the sculptors of the fifth century gave expression to  the Homeric conceptions.    The tales, too, that were told about the gods, some of them trivial  enough, but others full of religious and ethical significance, had for  some time before this been common subjects upon reliefs and  vase-paintings, and on these also the influence of the poets was very  great. Here we have not only the Iliad and Odyssey to consider, but many  other early epics that are now lost to us. The vase-painter or sculptor  did not, indeed, merely illustrate these stories as a modern artist  might; often he had a separate tradition and a repertory of subjects  belonging to his own art, and developed them along different lines from  those followed by the poets. But although this tradition might lead him  to choose a version less familiar to poetry, or even to give a new form  to an old story, his conception was essentially poetical, in that it  implied an imaginative realisation of the scene or action, and even of  the character of the deity or hero represented.    The conception of the gods to be found in other early epics probably did  not differ essentially from that we find in the Iliad and Odyssey; but  with the Homeric hymns and with some of the earlier lyric poets we find  a change setting in. There seems to be a new interest in the adventures  of the gods themselves, apart from their relation to mankind; romantic  and even pathetic stories are told about them, implying almost a  psychological appreciation of their personality--the tale of Demeter's  mourning for her daughter Persephone, her wanderings and adventures; of  the love of Aphrodite for a mortal; of how Hermes invented the lyre and  tricked Apollo about his cattle; of the birth of Apollo and the founding  of his worship at Delos and Delphi; of the marvellous birth of Athena  from the head of Zeus. It is hardly too much to say that in the later of  these Homeric hymns--those that are mentioned first in the above  enumeration--an almost human interest is given to the gods, to their  sufferings and adventures. It is the same tendency which we see in the  lyric "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#4)"],[1,"collected at the bookstalls, and the bookstall  keeper was eying with dislike men who were under the impression that  they were in a free library.    An optimistic porter had relieved Garnet of his portmanteau and golf  clubs as he stepped out of his cab, and had arranged to meet him on  No. 6 platform, from which, he asserted, with the quiet confidence  which has made Englishmen what they are, the eleven-twenty would start  on its journey to Axminster. Unless, he added, it went from No. 4.    Garnet, having bought a ticket, after drawing blank at two booking  offices, made his way to the bookstall. Here he inquired, in a loud,  penetrating voice, if they had got \"Mr. Jeremy Garnet's last novel,  'The Maneuvers of Arthur.'\" Being informed that they had not, he  clicked his tongue cynically, advised the man in charge to order that  work, as the demand for it might be expected shortly to be large, and  spent a shilling on a magazine and some weekly papers. Then, with ten  minutes to spare, he went off in search of Ukridge.    He found him on platform No. 6. The porter's first choice was, it  seemed, correct. The eleven-twenty was already alongside the platform,  and presently Garnet observed his porter cleaving a path toward him  with the portmanteau and golf clubs.    \"Here you are!\" shouted Ukridge. \"Good for you. Thought you were going  to miss it.\"    Garnet shook hands with the smiling Mrs. Ukridge.    \"I've got a carriage,\" said Ukridge, \"and collared two corner seats.  My wife goes down in another. She dislikes the smell of smoke when  she's traveling. Let's pray that we get the carriage to ourselves. But  all London seems to be here this morning. Get in, old horse. I'll just  see her ladyship into her carriage and come back to you.\"    Garnet entered the compartment, and stood at the door, looking out in  order, after the friendly manner of the traveling Briton, to thwart an  invasion of fellow-travelers. Then he withdrew his head suddenly and  sat down. An elderly gentleman, accompanied by a girl, was coming  toward him. It was not this type of fellow-traveler whom he hoped to  keep out. He had noticed the girl at the booking office. She had  waited by the side of the line, while the elderly gentleman struggled  gamely for the tickets, and he had plenty of opportunity of observing  her appearance. For five minutes he had debated with himself as to  whether her hair should rightly be described as brown or golden. He  had decided finally on brown. It then became imperative that he should  ascertain the color of her eyes. Once only had he met them, and then  only for a second. They might be blue. They might be gray. He could  not be certain. The elderly gentleman came to the door of the  compartment and looked in.    \"This seems tolerably empty, my dear Phyllis,\" he said.    Garnet, his glance fixed on his magazine, made a note of the name. It  harmonized admirably with the hair and the eyes of elusive color.    \"You are sure you do not object to a smoking carriage, my dear?\"    \"Oh, no, father. Not at all.\"    Garnet told himself that the voice was just the right sort of voice to  go with the hair, the eyes, and the name.    \"Then I think--\" said the elderly gentleman, getting in. The  inflection of his voice suggested the Irishman. It was not a brogue.  There were no strange words. But the general effect was Irish. Garnet  congratulated himself. Irishmen are generally good company. An  Irishman with a pretty daughter should be unusually good company.    The bustle on the platform had increased momently, until now, when,  from the snorting of the engine, it seemed likely that the train might  start at any minute, the crowd's excitement was extreme. Shrill cries  echoed down the platform. Lost sheep, singly and in companies, rushed  to and fro, peering eagerly into carriages in the search for seats.  Piercing cries ordered unknown \"Tommies\" and \"Ernies\" to \"keep by  aunty, now.\" Just as Ukridge returned, the dreaded \"Get in anywhere\"  began to be heard, and the next moment an avalanche of warm humanity  poured into the carriage. A silent but bitter curse framed itself on  Garnet's lips. His chance of pleasant conversation with the lady of  the brown hair and the eyes that were either gray or blue was at an  end.    The newcomers consisted of a middle-aged lady, addressed as aunty; a  youth called Albert, subsequently described by Garnet as the rudest  boy on earth--a proud title, honestly won; lastly, a niece of some  twenty years, stolid and seemingly without interest in life.    Ukridge slipped into his corner, adroitly foiling Albert, who had made  a dive in that direction. Albert regarded him fixedly for a space,  then sank into the seat beside Garnet and began to chew something  grewsome that smelled of aniseed.    Aunty, meanwhile, was distributing her weight evenly between the toes  of the Irish gentleman and those of his daughter, as she leaned out of  the window to converse with a lady friend in a straw hat and hair  curlers. Phyllis, he noticed, was bearing it with angelic calm. Her  profile, when he caught sight of it round aunty, struck him as a  little cold, even haughty. That, however, might be due to what she was  suffering. It is unfair to judge a lady's character from her face, at  a moment when she is in a position of physical discomfort. The train  moved off with a jerk in the middle of a request on the part of the  straw-hatted lady that her friend would \"remember that, you know,  about _him_,\" and aunty, staggering back, sat down on a bag of food  which Albert had placed on the seat beside him.    \"Clumsy!\" observed Albert tersely.    \"Al_bert_, you mustn't speak to aunty so.\"    \"Wodyer want sit on my bag for, then?\" inquired Albert.    They argued the point.    Garnet, who should have been busy studying character for a novel of  the lower classes, took up his magazine and began to read. The odor of  aniseed became more and more painful. Ukridge had lighted a cigar, and  Garnet understood why Mrs. Ukridge preferred to travel in another  compartment. For \"in his hand he bore the brand which none but he  might smoke.\"    Garnet looked stealthily across the carriage to see how his lady of  the hair and eyes was enduring this combination of evils, and noticed  that she, too, had begun to read. And as she put down the book to look  out of the window at the last view of London, he saw with a thrill  that it was \"The Maneuvers of Arthur.\" Never before had he come upon a  stranger reading his work. And if \"The Maneuvers of Arthur\" could make  the reader oblivious to surroundings such as these, then, felt Garnet,  it was no common book--a fact which he had long since suspected.    The train raced on toward the sea. It was a warm day, and a torpid  peace began to settle down on the carriage.    Soon only Garnet, the Irishman, and the lady were awake.    \"What's your book, me dear?\" asked the Irishman.    \"'The Maneuvers of Arthur,' father,\" said Phyllis. \"By Jeremy Garnet.\"    Garnet would not have believed without the evidence of his ears that  his name could possibly have sounded so well.    \"Dolly Strange gave it to me when I left the abbey,\" continued  Phyllis. \"She keeps a shelf of books for her guests when they are  going away. Books that she considers rubbish and doesn't want, you  know.\"    Garnet hated Dolly Strange without further evidence.    \"And what do you think of it, me dear?\"    \"I like it,\" said Phyllis decidedly. The carriage swam before  Garnet's eyes. \"I think it is very clever. I shall keep it.\"    \"Bless you,\" thought Garnet, \"and I will write my precious autograph  on every page, if you want it.\"    \"I wonder who Jeremy Garnet is?\" said Phyllis. \"I imagine him rather  an old young man, probably with an eyeglass and conceited. He must be  conceited. I can tell that from the style. And I should think he  didn't know many girls. At least, if he thinks Pamela Grant an  ordinary sort of girl.\"    \"Is she not?\" asked her father.    \"She's a cr-r-reature,\" said Phyllis emphatically.    This was a blow to Garnet, and demolished the self-satisfaction which  her earlier criticisms had caused to grow within him. He had always  looked on Pamela as something very much out of the ordinary run of  feminine character studies. That scene between her and the curate in  the conservatory.... And when she finds Arthur at the meet of the  Blankshire.... He was sorry she did not like Pamela. Somehow it  lowered Pamela in his estimation.    \"But I like Arthur,\" said Phyllis, and she smiled--the first time  Garnet had seen her do so.    Garnet also smiled to himself. Arthur was the hero. He was a young  writer. Ergo, Arthur was himself.    The train was beginning to slow down. Signs of returning animation  began to be noticeable among the sleepers. A whistle from the engine,  and the train drew up in a station. Looking out of the window, Garnet  saw that it was Yeovil. There was a general exodus. Aunty became  instantly a thing of dash and electricity, collected parcels, shook  Albert, replied to his thrusts with repartee, and finally headed a  stampede out of the door.    To Garnet's chagrin the Irish gentleman and his daughter also rose.  Apparently this was to be the end of their brief acquaintanceship.  They alighted and walked down the platform.    \"Where are we?\" said Ukridge sleepily, opening his eyes. \"Yeovil? Not  far now, old horse.\"    With which remark he closed his eyes again and returned to his  slumbers.    Garnet's eye, roving disconsolately over the carriage, was caught by  something lying in the far corner. It was the criticized \"Maneuvers of  Arthur.\" The girl had left it behind.    What follows shows the vanity that obsesses our young and rising  authors. It did not enter into his mind that the book might have been  left behind of set purpose, as being of no further use to the owner.  It only occurred to him that if he did not act swiftly the lady of the  hair and eyes "]]]
