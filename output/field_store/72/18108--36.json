Biddulph Phillips, some sixty years ago, was examining the  confused and unsorted mass of charters and grants in the possession of the  cathedral, he found a parchment (which bore the two beautiful episcopal  seals of Bishop Roger le Poer of Sarum and Bishop Adam de Orleton of  Hereford) that acknowledged and confirmed this grant of tithes to the  sustentation of the fabric of the cathedral, which still forms the  backbone of the fabric fund. In 1328 Bishop Orleton was translated to  Worcester.    During the ensuing war with France, the church walls echoed with prayers  for the King's success, and, while the war-cloud still darkened the  political sky, orisons louder and more heartfelt filled the cathedral. It  is said that when the \"Black Death\" reached Hereford in 1349, to retard  its progress in the city the shrine of St. Thomas de Cantilupe was carried  in procession.    About this time, and possibly not unconnected with the calamity of this  terrible plague, Bishop Trilleck issued a mandate prohibiting the  performance of \"theatrical plays and interludes\" in churches as \"contrary  to the practice of religion.\" The exact character of these performances is  doubtful, and the prohibition may have referred to some kind of secular  mumming. The mystery play survived long after Bishop Trilleck's time in an  annual pageant exhibited in the cathedral on Corpus Christi Day, to assist  in which some of the city guilds were obliged by the rules of their  incorporation.    The quarrels between the townspeople and the Bishop about his rights of  jurisdiction continued with more or less frequency. It must certainly have  been irritating to good Bishop Trilleck \"_gratus, prudens, pius_\" as the  mutilated inscription on his effigy describes him, when one William Corbet  forced his way into the palace, carried away the porter bodily, shut him  in the city gaol, and took away the keys of the palace.    On the second visitation of the \"Black Death,\" 1361-2, it is said that the  city market was removed from Hereford to a place about a mile on the west  of the town, still marked by a cross called the \"White Cross\" bearing the  arms of Bishop Charleton.    If Bishop Orleton was deeply concerned in the deposition of King Edward  II., a later Bishop of Hereford, Thomas Trevenant, who was appointed in  1389 by papal provision, was no less active in the deposition of King  Richard II., and was sent to the Pope with the Archbishop of York by Henry  IV. to explain his title to the Crown and announce his accession.    In 1396, during the episcopate of Bishop Gilbert, the priest vicars of the  cathedral were formed into a college by Royal Charter, and the first  warden or \"_custos_\" was appointed by the King to show that the right of  appointment was vested in the Crown. The college was to have a common  seal, and to exercise the right of acquiring and holding property, but to  be subject to the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral. Its members were the  priests of the chantry chapels in the cathedral, at this time apparently  twenty-seven in number.    In 1475 the college was moved from Castle Street to its present site, so  that the vicars should be able more comfortably to attend the night  services. An order was also made about this time concerning the  celebration of mass at the altar of St. John Baptist in the cathedral, an  arrangement which shows that then as now the parish of St. John had no  church of its own outside the cathedral walls.    About 1418, the cloister connecting the Bishop's palace with the cathedral  was begun by Bishop Lacy, who took great interest in the cathedral  although he never visited his diocese. It was upon this work of the  cloisters that 2800 marks were expended by Bishop Spofford, 1421-1448, in  whose time the great west window was erected by William Lochard, the  precentor. The richly panelled and vaulted chapel of Bishop Stanbury,  approached from the north aisle of the presbytery, was added between 1453  and 1474.    In 1492 Edmund Audley, the Bishop of Rochester, was translated to  Hereford, and during his episcopate founded the two-storied chantry chapel  south of the Lady Chapel and near the shrine of St. Thomas of Cantilupe.  The upper story was probably intended as a private oratory for the Bishop  himself. Bishop Audley also presented to the cathedral a silver shrine.                        [Illustration: THE AUDLEY CHAPEL.]                                THE AUDLEY CHAPEL.      The next important alteration was the lengthening of the great north porch  which bears the date 1519 and the shields of Bishop Booth and his  predecessor, Bishop Mayo. It is a very fine piece of Perpendicular work,  somewhat similar in design to the porch in the middle of the west front of  Peterborough Cathedral. At his death Bishop Booth left various books to  the cathedral library and some tapestry for the high altar, together with  silver and gold ornaments for the Cantilupe Shrine. The tapestry displayed  the story of David and Nabal. He also bequeathed, amongst other things to  his successor, the gold ring with which he was consecrated, but  notwithstanding his forethought in specifying that these articles were not  to be taken away with such successor in case of his translation, they have  disappeared. Little could Bishop Booth have imagined, in the enthusiasm of  his building operations, the changes to follow so closely upon his death.  Yet the papal supremacy had been abolished in this country in 1534, and  though the church services remained unaltered, the amended Primer had been  published. On September 26th, 1535, was consecrated at Winchester, to the  See of Hereford, one of the most \"excellent instruments\" of the  Reformation, Edward Foxe, and in the following year the suppression of the  monasteries began in serious earnest. Still the chantry chapels were to be  spared for some time. Of these chantries and chapels there were then no  less than twenty-one in the cathedral.    In 1553, commissioners were appointed to visit the churches, chapels,  guilds, and fraternities all over the kingdom and take inventories of  their treasures, leaving to each parish church or chapel \"one or two  chalices according to the multitude of people.\" In Hereford Cathedral,  amongst other valuable ornaments, was a chalice of gold weighing 22 lbs.  9-1/2 oz., two basins weighing 102 oz., and an enamelled pastoral staff in  five pieces of silver gilt weighing 11 lbs. 7 oz. 3 dwts. troy. It is not  possible to learn the value of the goods appropriated in the cathedral  alone, but the jewels and plate of the whole country were estimated at  4860-1/4 ounces, in value about L1213, 1s. 3d.    On August 22nd or 25th, 1642, the Royal Standard was set up at Nottingham,  and the clouds of the Great Rebellion burst over the country. Bishop Coke  of Hereford had been one of the twelve churchmen most active against the  Bill for excluding the bishops from Parliament, passed in the Commons in  May 1641, and was one of the ten bishops committed to the Tower by the  joint sentence of the Lords and Commons on charge of treason.    The \"popishly inclined\" county of Hereford was at one with its Bishop, but  so unprepared for war that Lord Stamford, with two troops of cavalry and a  single infantry regiment, entered Hereford under the orders of the Earl of  Essex and quartered himself in the Bishop's palace. Here he remained till  December 14th without, however, any serious plundering in the town itself.  In April 1643, Waller took the city for the second time, and again without  much resistance, a condition of the surrender being the immunity of the  Bishop and cathedral clergy from personal violence and plunder. On his  leaving Hereford the place was retaken by the Royalists, and became an  asylum for fugitive Roman Catholics. So it went on, being held first by  one side and then by the other. In the autumn of 1645 Hereford was  besieged by Lord Leven with the Scottish army, who were driven off by  Colonel Barnabas Scudamore with heavy loss.    The cathedral at this time suffered considerable injury during the siege.  The defenders used the lead from the chapter-house roof to cover the keep  of the castle, and possibly also to make bullets. Finally, on December  18th, through the treachery of Colonel Birch, the governor of the city,  Hereford was once more taken, and this time the whole place was overrun by  a rabble of plundering soldiery.    No doubt much damage had been done in the cathedral during the  Reformation, but despite the protests of an antiquarian captain, one Silas  Taylor, far greater mischief was perpetrated in this military loot. \"The  storied windows richly dight\" were smashed to bits, monumental brasses  torn up, the library plundered of most valuable MSS., and rich ornaments  stolen.    Some while after the Restoration, an appeal was made by the cathedral  clergy to the nobility, baronets, knights, esquires, and gentry of the  county for help towards restoring the cathedral, though it is not known  with what welcome the appeal was received.    Towards the beginning of the eighteenth century much harm was done to the  cathedral by the zeal of Bishop Bisse, one of those irritating people who  mean well but act abominably. He spent much, both on the palace and the  cathedral, employing in the alterations of the former the stones of the  chapter-house, which had been doubtless much injured but not irreparably  so. In the cathedral itself he erected a mass of masonry intended to  support the central tower, which was, however, nothing but a hideous  architectural blunder. In itself it was ugly to behold, and actually  weakened by lateral pressure that which it was intended to support. He  also presented an elaborate altar-piece and Grecian oak screen with scenic  decoration above, boards painted to represent curtains, and wooden  imitations of tassels which hung"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans (#4)"],[1,"wreck was made  of the south-eastern part of the church westward of the tower. But this  disaster was accompanied by a great marvel, for though many persons were  standing close by, not one was injured; and a still more wonderful thing  is recorded: the monk whose duty it was to guard the shrine of St.  Amphibalus, which at that time stood in the nave, had been celebrating  at the altar--he had finished even to the washing of the sacred  vessels--when he saw the columns fall; he withdrew a little from the  altar and received no harm. Some of the wreckage fell on the shrine of  St. Amphibalus, and though the marble pillars supporting the canopy were  broken, yet the chest which contained his relics suffered no harm. This  wonderful preservation of life and limb and shrine was naturally  attributed to the intervention of the blessed martyr St. Amphibalus.    Abbot Hugh of Eversden began to rebuild this ruined part of the church,  and this accounts for the five bays of the nave arcading westward of the  rood-screen being in fourteenth-century style. He did not live to finish  all this work, but it was carried on by his successor, Richard of  Wallingford (1326-1335), and finished by the next Abbot, Michael of  Mentmore, about 1345. The present rood-screen, which probably took the  place of a previously existing one of Norman date, was built in 1360 by  Thomas de la Mare. No further change of importance was made until the  time of John of Wheathampstead, who was Abbot from 1420 to 1440, and  again from 1451 to 1464. He left his marks in various parts of the  Abbey, and for the most part his work was bad: he did almost as much to  injure the Abbey as the nineteenth-century restorers who swept away much  of his work have done. He rebuilt all the upper part of the west front,  and inserted Perpendicular windows at each end of the transept; he  turned the high-pitched roofs of nave and transepts into flat ones, and  lowered the slope of the roofs of the aisles. His object in doing this  was to be able to use the old beams again whose ends were decayed, and  which were shortened by cutting off the unsound parts. The result of  this was that the Norman triforium arches on the north side were thrown  open to the sky; these he filled with Perpendicular tracery, converting  them into windows. The tracery still remains, although the new roof has  the same slope as the original one, and the triforium is now again  inclosed beneath it. He also pulled down the wooden octagon on the  central tower. His chantry on the south side of the high altar was  probably erected soon after his death.    Abbot William of Wallingford (1476-1484) built the high altar screen,  carrying out a plan which John of Wheathampstead had not been able to  accomplish. The only addition made after this to the Abbey is the  chantry of Thomas Ramryge, who became Abbot in 1492. The exact date of  its construction is not known, all records of the Abbey during Ramryge's  rule having perished; but from its style it is generally supposed to  have been built about the year 1520. During the reign of Henry VIII. all  the monasteries were dissolved; first the smaller, then the more  important ones, among them that of St. Albans. The fortieth and last  Abbot of St. Albans, Richard Boreman of Stevenage, surrendered the Abbey  on December 5th, 1539, he and the monks receiving pensions as  compensation.    [Illustration: EXTERIOR OF LADY CHAPEL WHEN USED AS THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL  BEFORE 1874. (From the Official Guide to the Great Northern Railway.)]    In February of the following year the King granted to Sir Richard Lee  all the monastic buildings, but not the Abbey Church or the adjoining  Chapel of St. Andrew, with all the land lying round the Abbey Church.  Lee promptly proceeded to destroy all the domestic buildings. The church  remained in the possession of the Crown till 1553, when the town  obtained a charter from Edward VI. This, among other provisions,  empowered it to erect a grammar school within the church or in some  other convenient place. The town authorities thereupon converted the  Lady Chapel and the retro-choir into the grammar school. A passage was  cut through the retro-choir, bounded by brick walls on either side; this  was used as a public pathway until 1874, when it was closed, and again  became part of the church. The part to the east of the passage served as  the grammar school until 1870. The mayor and burgesses by the same  charter received the Abbey Church, in return for L400, to be used as  their parish church; and in May, 1553, the first rector, George  Wetherall, took charge of the building.    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE LADY CHAPEL BEFORE 1874.  (From the Official Guide to the Great Northern Railway.)]    The parishioners thus found themselves in possession of an enormous  building which they had not sufficient money to keep in proper repair.  In 1612, and again in 1681, briefs or letters patent were issued by  royal authority, ordering collections to be made in all churches in  England for the repair of St. Albans Church. In 1689 a grant was made by  William and Mary. These sums were spent on various repairs, such as  altering the belfry windows, \"filling up\" with earth \"the hollow in the  wing,\" that is, raising the level of the floor of the south arm of the  transept. In 1695 similar work was done in the north aisle; in 1704 a  new window, a wooden one, was inserted in the south end of the transept,  in place of Wheathampstead's, which had been blown in by a gale during  the previous year. There are records of L100 being spent in recasting  some of the bells between 1705 and 1707.    Money was again collected in 1721 by letters patent, and this was spent  on repairing the ceilings. About the same time a legacy was spent in  repaving the nave, and the west ends of the aisles were blocked by brick  walls. Some slight repairs were done about 1764, when a fresh collection  was made.    More extensive repairs were made in 1832: the roof was releaded, such of  the clerestory windows as had been closed were reglazed, and the south  window of the transept was rebuilt in stone. The choir, after the  repairs, was opened for service in 1833. The nave to the west of the  rood-screen was more or less in a dilapidated condition, protected by  the releaded roof, but not used. The presbytery had been fitted up in  Georgian style as a chancel, the organ stood in the north arm of the  transept, and high pews filled the choir westward as far as the  rood-screen. This was the condition of the part of the church which was  used up to 1870.    In 1856 a scheme was started for getting the Abbey Church raised to  cathedral rank, and also for restoring the fabric. Mr. (afterwards Sir)  Gilbert Scott was appointed architect, and was empowered to do what he  thought most pressing as far as funds would allow; the flat roof of the  north aisle was renewed, drainage attended to, and foundations  strengthened; the floor at the south end of the transept was lowered--it  will be remembered that it had been raised in 1692--the vaults were  filled with concrete, and the floor repaved. The presbytery was repaved  with tiles copied from some old ones. The Georgian fittings were removed  to the nave; fragments of the tabernacles, which we now see over the  doors leading from the aisles into the presbytery, having been  discovered, the tabernacles were reconstructed of the old with some new  material. But more important work had to be undertaken in 1870. On  Sunday, July 31st, the sound of cracking was heard in the tower, and Mr.  J. Chapple, the clerk of the works, went up the next day to London to  see Scott and asked him to come down at once to examine the tower;  plaster was put over the crack to see if it was increasing or not. There  were soon signs that the mischief was getting worse, and Scott ordered  the tower to be shored up with timber, and temporary brick walls to be  built below it. It seemed that the rubble of the eastern piers had been  made of mortar which had turned into dust, and that a big hole had been  cut in the south-eastern pier. This, according to Lord Grimthorpe, had  apparently been done with the intention of demolishing the tower,  probably soon after the time of the dissolution of the monastery, for  the hole contained timber shores which were sufficient to support the  tower while the workmen were enlarging the hole, but which were probably  intended to be set on fire and burnt away, thus allowing the workmen to  escape before the tower fell. This wood was found partially decayed, and  probably to its state the settlement of the tower was partially due. The  hole was, by Scott's direction, filled with bricks laid in cement, and  cement was poured in to fill up all the interstices; some of the decayed  rubble was cut out of the piers and brickwork put in to take its place:  the walls were tied with Yorkshire flagstone and iron rods, and were  grouted with liquid cement wherever possible. It was an anxious time for  those in charge of the work; it was only after many days and nights of  incessant labour, that they felt sure that the sinking of the tower was  arrested and that the new work was holding up the weight.    In 1875 it was discovered that the south-west clerestory was beginning  to crumble away. Lord Grimthorpe had this shored up at his own expense.  A new committee was soon after this appointed, and in March, 1877, a  faculty was granted to this committee \"to repair the church and fit it  for cathedral and parochial services.\" The first Bishop, Dr. Claughton,  who up to this time had been Bishop of Rochester, choosing the northern  of the two parts into which his diocese was divided, was enthroned as  Bishop of St. Albans on June 12th, 1877, and on the following day the  restoration of the nave was begun. The church was in a very bad state:  the weight of the roof and injudicious repairs had thrust the clerestory  walls"]]]
