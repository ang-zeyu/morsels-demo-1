[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19298"],[0,"The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh (#4)"],[1,"Baha'i  teachings foreshadow, can be revealed only in the fullness of time, that  the implications of the Aqdas and the Will of 'Abdu'l-Baha, as the twin  repositories of the constituent elements of that Sovereignty, are too  far-reaching for this generation to grasp and fully appreciate. I cannot  refrain from appealing to them who stand identified with the Faith to  disregard the prevailing notions and the fleeting fashions of the day, and  to realize as never before that the exploded theories and the tottering  institutions of present-day civilization must needs appear in sharp  contrast with those God-given institutions which are destined to arise  upon their ruin. I pray that they may realize with all their heart and  soul the ineffable glory of their calling, the overwhelming responsibility  of their mission, and the astounding immensity of their task.    For let every earnest upholder of the Cause of Baha'u'llah realize that  the storms which this struggling Faith of God must needs encounter, as the  process of the disintegration of society advances, shall be fiercer than  any which it has already experienced. Let him be aware that so soon as the  full measure of the stupendous claim of the Faith of Baha'u'llah comes to  be recognized by those time-honored and powerful strongholds of orthodoxy,  whose deliberate aim is to maintain their stranglehold over the thoughts  and consciences of men, this infant Faith will have to contend with  enemies more powerful and more insidious than the cruellest  torture-mongers and the most fanatical clerics who have afflicted it in  the past. What foes may not in the course of the convulsions that shall  seize a dying civilization be brought into existence, who will reinforce  the indignities which have already been heaped upon it!          The Onslaught of All Peoples and Kindreds      We have only to refer to the warnings uttered by 'Abdu'l-Baha in order to  realize the extent and character of the forces that are destined to  contest with God's holy Faith. In the darkest moments of His life, under  'Abdu'l-Hamid's regime, when He stood ready to be deported to the most  inhospitable regions of Northern Africa, and at a time when the auspicious  light of the Baha'i Revelation had only begun to break upon the West, He,  in His parting message to the cousin of the Bab, uttered these prophetic  and ominous words: \"How great, how very great is the Cause! How very  fierce the onslaught of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth. Ere  long shall the clamor of the multitude throughout Africa, throughout  America, the cry of the European and of the Turk, the groaning of India  and China, be heard from far and near. One and all, they shall arise with  all their power to resist His Cause. Then shall the knights of the Lord,  assisted by His grace from on high, strengthened by faith, aided by the  power of understanding, and reinforced by the legions of the Covenant,  arise and make manifest the truth of the verse: 'Behold the confusion that  hath befallen the tribes of the defeated!'\"    Stupendous as is the struggle which His words foreshadow, they also  testify to the complete victory which the upholders of the Greatest Name  are destined eventually to achieve. Peoples, nations, adherents of divers  faiths, will jointly and successively arise to shatter its unity, to sap  its force, and to degrade its holy name. They will assail not only the  spirit which it inculcates, but the administration which is the channel,  the instrument, the embodiment of that spirit. For as the authority with  which Baha'u'llah has invested the future Baha'i Commonwealth becomes more  and more apparent, the fiercer shall be the challenge which from every  quarter will be thrown at the verities it enshrines.          Difference Between Baha'i Faith and Ecclesiastical Organizations      It behooves us, dear friends, to endeavor not only to familiarize  ourselves with the essential features of this supreme Handiwork of  Baha'u'llah, but also to grasp the fundamental difference existing between  this world-embracing, divinely-appointed Order and the chief  ecclesiastical organizations of the world, whether they pertain to the  Church of Christ, or to the ordinances of the Muhammadan Dispensation.    For those whose priceless privilege is to guard over, administer the  affairs, and advance the interests of these Baha'i institutions will have,  sooner or later, to face this searching question: \"Where and how does this  Order established by Baha'u'llah, which to outward seeming is but a  replica of the institutions established in Christianity and Islam, differ  from them? Are not the twin institutions of the House of Justice and of  the Guardianship, the institution of the Hands of the Cause of God, the  institution of the national and local Assemblies, the institution of the  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, but different names for the institutions of the  Papacy and the Caliphate, with all their attending ecclesiastical orders  which the Christians and Moslems uphold and advocate? What can possibly be  the agency that can safeguard these Baha'i institutions, so strikingly  resemblant, in some of their features, to those which have been reared by  the Fathers of the Church and the Apostles of Muhammad, from witnessing  the deterioration in character, the breach of unity, and the extinction of  influence, which have befallen all organized religious hierarchies? Why  should they not eventually suffer the self-same fate that has overtaken  the institutions which the successors of Christ and Muhammad have reared?\"    Upon the answer given to these challenging questions will, in a great  measure, depend the success of the efforts which believers in every land  are now exerting for the establishment of God's kingdom upon the earth.  Few will fail to recognize that the Spirit breathed by Baha'u'llah upon  the world, and which is manifesting itself with varying degrees of  intensity through the efforts consciously displayed by His avowed  supporters and indirectly through certain humanitarian organizations, can  never permeate and exercise an abiding influence upon mankind unless and  until it incarnates itself in a visible Order, which would bear His name,  wholly identify itself with His principles, and function in conformity  with His laws. That Baha'u'llah in His Book of Aqdas, and later  'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will--a document which confirms, supplements, and  correlates the provisions of the Aqdas--have set forth in their entirety  those essential elements for the constitution of the world Baha'i  Commonwealth, no one who has read them will deny. According to these  divinely-ordained administrative principles, the Dispensation of  Baha'u'llah--the Ark of human salvation--must needs be modeled. From them,  all future blessings must flow, and upon them its inviolable authority  must ultimately rest.    For Baha'u'llah, we should readily recognize, has not only imbued mankind  with a new and regenerating Spirit. He has not merely enunciated certain  universal principles, or propounded a particular philosophy, however  potent, sound and universal these may be. In addition to these He, as well  as 'Abdu'l-Baha after Him, has, unlike the Dispensations of the past,  clearly and specifically laid down a set of Laws, established definite  institutions, and provided for the essentials of a Divine Economy. These  are destined to be a pattern for future society, a supreme instrument for  the establishment of the Most Great Peace, and the one agency for the  unification of the world, and the proclamation of the reign of  righteousness and justice upon the earth. Not only have they revealed all  the directions required for the practical realization of those ideals  which the Prophets of God have visualized, and which from time immemorial  have inflamed the imagination of seers and poets in every age. They have  also, in unequivocal and emphatic language, appointed those twin  institutions of the House of Justice and of the Guardianship as their  chosen Successors, destined to apply the principles, promulgate the laws,  protect the institutions, adapt loyally and intelligently the Faith to the  requirements of progressive society, and consummate the incorruptible  inheritance which the Founders of the Faith have bequeathed to the world.    Should we look back upon the past, were we to search out the Gospel and  the Qur'an, we will readily recognize that neither the Christian nor the  Islamic Dispensations can offer a parallel either to the system of Divine  Economy so thoroughly established by Baha'u'llah, or to the safeguards  which He has provided for its preservation and advancement. Therein, I am  profoundly convinced, lies the answer to those questions to which I have  already referred.    None, I feel, will question the fact that the fundamental reason why the  unity of the Church of Christ was irretrievably shattered, and its  influence was in the course of time undermined, was that the Edifice which  the Fathers of the Church reared after the passing of His First Apostle  was an Edifice that rested in nowise upon the explicit directions of  Christ Himself. The authority and features of their administration were  wholly inferred, and indirectly derived, with more or less justification,  from certain vague and fragmentary references which they found scattered  amongst His utterances as recorded in the Gospel. Not one of the  sacraments of the Church; not one of the rites and ceremonies which the  Christian Fathers have elaborately devised and ostentatiously observed;  not one of the elements of the severe discipline they rigorously imposed  upon the primitive Christians; none of these reposed on the direct  authority of Christ, or emanated from His specific utterances. Not one of  these did Christ conceive, none did He specifically invest with sufficient  authority to either interpret His Word, or to add to what He had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19299"],[0,"The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá (#4)"],[1,"regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy  Text. By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the  Guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished  member for life of that body. Should he not attend in person its  deliberations, he must appoint one to represent him. Should any of the  members commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the Guardian of the  Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel him, whereupon  the people must elect another one in his stead. This House of Justice  enacteth the laws and the government enforceth them. The legislative body  must reinforce the executive, the executive must aid and assist the  legislative body so that through the close union and harmony of these two  forces, the foundation of fairness and justice may become firm and strong,  that all the regions of the world may become even as Paradise itself.    O Lord, my God! Assist Thy loved ones to be firm in Thy Faith, to walk in  Thy ways, to be steadfast in Thy Cause. Give them Thy grace to withstand  the onslaught of self and passion, to follow the light of Divine Guidance.  Thou art the Powerful, the Gracious, the Self-Subsisting, the Bestower,  the Compassionate, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.    O friends of 'Abdu'l-Baha! The Lord, as a sign of His infinite bounties,  hath graciously favored His servants by providing for a fixed money  offering (Huquq), to be dutifully presented unto Him, though He, the True  One and His servants have been at all times independent of all created  things, and God verily is the All-Possessing, exalted above the need of  any gift from His creatures. This fixed money offering, however, causeth  the people to become firm and steadfast and draweth Divine increase upon  them. It is to be offered through the Guardian of the Cause of God, that  it may be expended for the diffusion of the Fragrances of God and the  exaltation of His Word, for benevolent pursuits and for the common weal.    O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive to all  monarchs that are just and to show your fidelity to every righteous king.  Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty.  Show obedience unto them and be their well-wishers. Without their leave  and permission do not meddle with political affairs, for disloyalty to the  just sovereign is disloyalty to God Himself.    This is my counsel and the commandment of God unto you. Well is it with  them that act accordingly.                                    * * * * *          (This written paper hath for a long time been preserved under      ground, damp having affected it. When brought forth to the light      it was observed that certain parts of it were injured by the damp,      and the Holy Land being sorely agitated it was left untouched.)            PART TWO      He Is God    O My Lord, my heart's Desire, Thou Whom I ever invoke, Thou Who art my  Aider and my Shelter, my Helper and my Refuge! Thou seest me submerged in  an ocean of calamities that overwhelm the soul, of afflictions that  oppress the heart, of woes that disperse Thy gathering, of ills and pains  that scatter Thy flock. Sore trials have compassed me round and perils  have from all sides beset me. Thou seest me immersed in a sea of  unsurpassed tribulation, sunk into a fathomless abyss, afflicted by mine  enemies and consumed with the flame of their hate, enkindled by my kinsmen  with whom Thou didst make Thy strong Covenant and Thy firm Testament,  wherein Thou biddest them turn their hearts to this wronged one, to keep  away from me the foolish, the unjust, and refer unto this lonely one all  that about which they differ in Thy Holy Book, so that the Truth may be  revealed unto them, their doubts may be dispelled and Thy manifest Signs  be spread abroad.    Yet now Thou seest them, O Lord, my God! with Thine eye that sleepeth not,  how that they have broken Thy Covenant and turned their backs thereon, how  with hate and rebelliousness they have erred from Thy Testament and have  arisen intent upon malice.    Adversities have waxed still more severe as they rose with unbearable  cruelty to overpower and crush me, as they scattered far and wide their  scrolls of doubt and in utter falsehood hurled their calumnies upon me.  Not content with this, their chief, O my God, hath dared to interpolate  Thy Book, to fraudulently alter Thy decisive Holy Text and falsify that  which hath been revealed by Thy All-Glorious Pen. He did also maliciously  insert that which Thou didst reveal for the one that hath wrought the most  glaring cruelty upon Thee, disbelieved in Thee and denied Thy wondrous  Signs, into what Thou didst reveal for this servant of Thine that hath  been wronged in this world. All this he did that he might beguile the  souls of men and breathe his evil whisperings into the hearts of Thy  devoted ones. Thereunto did their second chief testify, confessing it in  his own handwriting, setting thereupon his seal and spreading it  throughout all regions. O my God! Could there be a more grievous injustice  than this? And still they rested not, but further strove with  stubbornness, falsehood and slander, with scorn and calumny to stir up  sedition in the midst of the government of this land and elsewhere,  causing them to deem me a sower of sedition and filling the minds with  things that the ear abhorreth to hear. The government was thus alarmed,  fear fell upon the sovereign, and the suspicion of the nobility was  aroused. Minds were troubled, affairs were upset, souls were perturbed,  the fire of anguish and sorrow was kindled within the breasts, the Holy  Leaves (of the Household) were convulsed and shaken, their eyes rained  with tears, their sighs and lamentations were raised and their hearts  burned within them as they bewailed this wronged servant of Thine, fallen  a victim into the hands of these, his kindred, nay, his very enemies!    Lord! Thou seest all things weeping over Me and My kindred rejoicing in My  woes. By Thy Glory, O my God! Even amongst mine enemies, some have  lamented my troubles and my distress, and of the envious ones a number  have shed tears because of my cares, my exile and my afflictions. They did  this because they found naught in me but affection and care and witnessed  naught but kindliness and mercy. As they saw me swept into the flood of  tribulation and adversity and exposed even as a target to the arrows of  fate, their hearts were moved with compassion, tears came to their eyes  and they testified declaring:--\"The Lord is our witness; naught have we  seen from him but faithfulness, generosity and extreme compassion.\" The  Covenant-breakers, foreboders of evil, however, waxed fiercer in their  rancor, rejoiced as I fell a victim to the most grievous ordeal, bestirred  themselves against me and made merry over the heartrending happenings  around me.    I call upon Thee, O Lord my God! with my tongue and with all my heart, not  to requite them for their cruelty and their wrong-doings, their craft and  their mischief, for they are foolish and ignoble and know not what they  do. They discern not good from evil, neither do they distinguish right  from wrong, nor justice from injustice. They follow their own desires and  walk in the footsteps of the most imperfect and foolish amongst them. O my  Lord! Have mercy upon them, shield them from all afflictions in these  troubled times and grant that all trials and hardships may be the lot of  this Thy servant that hath fallen into this darksome pit. Single me out  for every woe and make me a sacrifice for all Thy loved ones. O Lord, Most  High! May my soul, my life, my being, my spirit, my all be offered up for  them. O God, my God! Lowly, suppliant and fallen upon my face, I beseech  Thee with all the ardor of my invocation to pardon whosoever hath hurt me,  forgive him that hath conspired against me and offended me, and wash away  the misdeeds of them that have wrought injustice upon me. Vouchsafe unto  them Thy goodly gifts, give them joy, relieve them from sorrow, grant them  peace and prosperity, give them Thy bliss and pour upon them Thy bounty.    Thou art the Powerful, the Gracious, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting!    O dearly beloved friends! I am now in very great danger and the hope of  even an hour's life is lost to me. I am thus constrained to write these  lines for the protection of the Cause of God, the preservation of His Law,  the safeguarding of His Word and the safety of His Teachings. By the  Ancient Beauty! This wronged one hath in no wise borne nor doth he bear a  grudge against any one; towards none doth he entertain any ill-feeling and  uttereth no word save for the good of the world. My supreme obligation,  however, of necessity, prompteth me to guard and preserve the Cause of  God. Thus, with the greatest regret, I counsel you saying: Guard ye the  Cause of God, protect His law and have the utmost fear of discord. This is  the foundation of the belief of the people of Baha (may my life be offered  up for them): \"His Holiness, the Exalted One (the Bab), is the  Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the Forerunner of the  Ancient Beauty. His Holiness the Abha Beauty (may my life be a sacrifice  for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme Manifestation of God and the  Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence. All others are servants unto Him and  do His bidding.\" Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn, and all that  is not expressly recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House  of Justice. That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority  doth carry, that is verily the truth and the purpose of God Himself. Whoso  doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown  forth malice, and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant. By this House  is meant that Universal House of Justice which is to be elected from "]]]
