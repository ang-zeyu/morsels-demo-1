Peculiarly Roman also is the conception of the _manes_, or shades of the  departed, who hover as protecting genii about the living. Afterwards,  along with the culture of the Greeks, their gods also were taken,  although rather outwardly than inwardly, into the spirit of the people,  and the original character of the gods of Latium was modified after the  new mythology. Notwithstanding this, however, the worship of the Romans  retained its political and practical character. The priests (sacerdotes)  Flamines, Salii, Feciales, the Pontifices with the Pontifex Maximus at  their head, the Augurs, were likewise officers of the state, and did not  form a hierarchy apart from the state and alongside of it.      5. THE CELTS.    Among the Celtic tribes in Brittany, Ireland, and Gaul, and on both  banks of the Rhine, out of an aboriginal life of nature characterized by  wildness and license, religion developed itself in the form of the  worship of two chief divinities, a male divinity, Hu, the begetting, and  a female, Ceridwen, the bearing, power of nature. The priesthood busied  itself with speculations about the divine, the origin of the world, and  the continued existence of man after death, conceived in the form of the  transmigration of souls. Nor did the people's faith lack the conception  of good and evil spirits, fairies, dwarfs, elves, which to the still  childish fancy are objects of fear or superstitious veneration. To the  service of these divinities the priesthood, the Druids, were  consecrated, and beside them the bards, or poets, held a more  independent place.      6. THE GERMANS AND SCANDINAVIANS.    More developed intellectually is the nature-religion of the ancient  Germans (Teutons) and Scandinavians, which betrays thereby the character  of the Aryan race to which these nations, like the Celts, originally  belonged. The highest god of the Germans is Wodan, called Odhin among  the Norsemen, the god of the heavens, and of the sun, who protects the  earth, and is the source of light and fruitfulness, the spirit of the  world, and the All-father (Alfadhir). From the union of heaven and  earth, there springs the god Thunar or Donar among the Germans, Thor  among the Norsemen, the bold god of thunder who wages war against the  enemies of gods and men. Besides these there are the sons of Wodan, Fro  (German), Freyx (Norse), the god of peace, Zio (German), Tyx (Norse),  the god of war, Aki (German), Oegir (Norse), god of the sea, Vol  (German), Ullr (Norse), god of hunting, and others, to whom are joined  female divinities, such as Nerthus (German), Joerdh (Norse), the fruitful  goddess of the earth, Holda (German), Freiya (Norse), the goddess of  love, Nehalennia, goddess of plenty, Frikka (German), Frigg (Norse), the  wife of Wodan, mother of all the living, Hellia (German), Hel (Norse),  the inexorable goddess of the lower world. Opposed to these divinities  (Asen and Asinnen) stands Loko (German), Loki (Norse), enemy of the  divine. In addition to these there appear in the Norse and German Sagas,  besides the heroes, a multitude of spirits, good and hostile, giants,  elves, Elfen (German), Alfen (Norse), white spirits of light, and black  dwarfs, house, forest, and water spirits. The worship was most simple,  and, as was the case with the ancient Semites, the Indians of the Veda,  and the Greeks, as yet independent of temple service and priestly  constraint. The holy places of the Germans were woods, and hills, and  fountains, and in the mysterious rustling of the leaves and in the  murmuring of the waters the pious spirit caught the breathing of the  deity.[5] The father of the house is priest, and the recognition by  these races more than elsewhere of worth in woman is apparent also in  their religion. In the description of the kingdom of the dead in the  German-Norse mythology, Walhalla is the abode of the heroes, hell the  gathering place of the other dead. Notwithstanding these still childish  conceptions, there was revealed in the moral character and heroic spirit  of the German forefathers the germ of a higher development, which makes  the nations of Germany and Northern Europe capable beyond others of a  constantly higher conception and estimation of the Christian  religion.[6]          CHAPTER III.    THE RELIGION OF THE SEMITES.      I. THE PHOENICIANS, SYRIANS, BABYLONIANS, CARTHAGINIANS, AND ARABIANS.    In the Semitic races the religious spirit rose above nature-worship in  the effort to separate God from nature, and to elevate him above nature  as Lord, Baal (plural Baalim, either from the different places where he  was worshiped, or the various names under which he was worshiped), Bel,  El, Adon (Adonis). Thus Bel among the Babylonians, Baal among the  Ammonites and Moabites, was the god of light, the lord of heaven, the  creator of mankind, who had his throne above the clouds and was invoked  on mountains.[7] Also the title Molech and Baal Molech to designate the  Supreme Being among the ancient Phoenicians and Carthaginians, and the  nations nearest related to Israel, the Moabites and Ammonites, as well  as the derived names Milcom (Kamos) [Chemosh, Eng. ver.], among the  Ammonites, and Melkartht at Tyre and Carthage, indicate, like Baal, an  original effort to conceive God as the ruler of nature. Agreeing with  this conception of the Deity, there is manifest, as well in the worship  of Baal as of Molech and the female Astarte (Melecheth)[8] [Ashtaroth,  Eng. ver.], worshiped with him, partly in the abstinence from marriage,  partly in the human sacrifice, especially the sacrifice of the  first-born, the aim, through abnegation of the life of sense, and  through the sacrifice, even though unnatural, of what is dearest to man,  to appease a divinity who as lord and governor rules and subjects to  himself the power of nature and every propensity of sense.[9]    In spite of the effort to elevate the Deity as Lord and King above  nature, most of the Semitic nations gradually sank back into the old  nature-worship, and, uniting with the worship of the highest God, Baal  and Bel, that of a female divinity under the names of Baaltis, Beltis,  Aschera, Mylitta, they made religion to consist in the sacrifice of  chastity to the will of the Deity, as the fruitful, productive power of  nature, and thus fell into gross immorality.[10]    Religion appears in another form among the Semites in the worship of the  stars among the Babylonians and ancient Arabians. This astrolatry,  originally a kind of fetichism, became nature-worship, and gradually  rose to the worship of the intelligence manifested to our contemplation  in the movement of the heavenly luminaries. Astrology arose, and  religion no longer expressed itself in passive acquiescence, but was  united with the effort to guide the life by the knowledge to be drawn,  as men imagined, from the motion of the stars.      ISRAELITISH RELIGION.      _a. Its origin. The patriarchal religion. Mosaism. Prophetism._    While most of the Semitic nations, in opposition to the effort to  elevate God above nature as lord and governor, returned to the old  nature-religion with its grossly sensual worship of the divine, and  others got no farther than to the conception of a deity, who, like a  consuming fire, stood opposed to nature, and was to be appeased and  propitiated by human sacrifices, there was developed among the  Israelitish people, gradually and in constantly higher measure, in  connection with a higher moral and religious disposition, the worship of  God as a being who, though distinct from nature, is yet not opposed to  it, and thus no longer demands human sacrifices, but obedience and moral  consecration.    The common origin of the religion of the Israelites and that of their  Semitic relations, though hardly evident even in the oldest monuments of  the Hebrew literature, appears from the following facts and particulars:  firstly, the composition of Israelitish names not only with El, but also  with Baal, such as Jerubbaal (adversary of Baal), (Gideon),[11]  Esbaal,[12] Meribbaal,[13] names which afterwards, on account of the  aversion which the ever-increasing distance in religion between the  Israelitish nation and the nations related to it must, from the nature  of the case, have inspired against the name of Baal, are changed into  Jerubboseth,[14] Isboseth,[15] and Mephiboseth[16], as also the  interchanging of El and Baal,[17] of Baal-jada[18] and Eljada,[19] seem  to point to an ancient period when the name Baal (Lord) was used, like  El, Elohim, El Eljon, El Schaddai, Adonai, even among the Israelites,  to designate the Supreme Being. Secondly, the God of Abraham (Elohim),  although he desires no human sacrifices, nevertheless praises the  willingness of the father to offer up his first-born, and sees in that  the highest proof of devotedness and obedience.[20] Thirdly,  circumcision, already before Moses[21] the bloody symbol of consecration  to God,[22] and also the right of Jahveh to the first-born, and the  necessity of ransoming them from him,[23] imply an earlier conception of  the deity as a being, who, although on a higher development of the  religion he is not indeed any longer thought to desire human sacrifice,  nevertheless has a right to such a sacrifice, and thus demands indemnity  for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20153"],[0,"The American Journal of Archaeology, 1893-1 (#4)"],[1,"the route laid down for           him by Dörpfeld (_i.e._, if he described the two rows of           statues between the Propylaia and the eastern front of the           Parthenon, taking first the southern and then the northern           row), he would come to stand where Dörpfeld suggests. If,           however, he followed some other order (_e.g._, that suggested           by Wernicke, _Mitth._, XII, p. 187), he would not be where           Dörpfeld thinks. Pausanias does not say that the statues he           mentions are set up in two rows.[6] It may be that the           Acropolis was so thickly peopled with statues that each side of           the path was bordered with a double or triple row, or that the           statues were not arranged in rows at all, and that Pausanias           merely picks out from his memory (or his Polemon) a few           noticeable figures with only general reference to their           relative positions. Be this as it may, the assumption that           Pausanias, when he mentions the [Greek Spoudaiôn] (or [Greek:           spoudaiôn]) [Greek: daimôn] is standing, or imagines that he           stands, beside the old temple rests upon very slight           foundations.             [Footnote 5: DÖRPFELD'S arguments for the continued existence           of the temple, without which his theory that Pausanias           mentioned it must of course fall to the ground, will be           discussed below. It seemed to me advisable to discuss the           Pausanias question first, because, if he mentioned the temple,           it must have existed, if not to his time, at least to that of           Polemon or of his other (unknown) authority.]             [Footnote 6: The most than can be deduced from the use of           [Greek: peran] (c. 24.1) is, that the statues were on both           sides of the path.]             Whether Pausanias, in what he says of Ergane, the legless           Hermæ, _etc._, is, as Wernicke (_Mitth._, XII, p. 185) would           have it, merely inserting a bit of misunderstood learning, is           of little moment. I am not one of those who picture to  Page 4   themselves Pausanias going about copying inscriptions, asking           questions, and forming his own judgments, referring only           occasionally to books when he wished to refresh his memory or           look up some matter of history. The labors of Kalkmann,           Wilamowitz, and others have shown conclusively, that a large           part of Pausanias' periegesis is adopted from the works of           previous writers, and adopted in some cases with little care by           a man of no very striking intellectual ability. It is           convenient to speak as if Pausanias visited all the places and           saw all the things he describes, but it is certain that he does           not mention all he must in that case have seen, and perhaps           possible that he describes things he never can have seen.           Whether Pausanias travelled about Greece and then wrote his           description with the aid (largely employed) of previous works,           or wrote it without travelling, makes little difference except           when it is important to know the exact topographical order of           objects mentioned. In any case, however, his accuracy in detail           is hardly to be accepted without question, especially in his           description of the Acropolis, where he has to try his prentice           hand upon a material far too great for him. A useless bit of           lore stupidly applied may not be an impossibility for           Pausanias, but, however low our opinion of his intellect may           be, he is the best we have,[7] and must be treated accordingly.           The passage about Ergane, _etc._, must not be simply cast aside           as misunderstood lore, but neither should it be enriched by           inserting the description of a temple together with the           state-treasury. The passage must be explained without doing           violence to the Ms. tradition. That this is possible has lately           been shown by A.W. Verrall.[8] He says: _'What Pausanias           actually says is this--:_ \"The Athenians are specially           distinguished by religious zeal. The name of Ergane was first           given by them, and the name Hermæ; and in the temple along with           them is a Good Fortune of the Zealous\"_--words which are quite           as apt for the meaning above explained_ (_i.e._, a note on the           piety of the Athenians) _as those of the author often are in           such cases.'_             [Footnote 7: I think it is F.G. WELCKEK to whom the saying is           attributed: _Pausanias ist ein Schaf, aber ein Schaf mit           goldenem Vliesse._]             [Footnote 8: HARRISON and VERRALL, _Mythology and Monuments of           Athens_, p. 610. I am not sure that a colorless verb has not           fallen out after [Greek: Ermas], though the assumption of a gap           is not strictly necessary, as Prof. Verrall shows.]    Page 5   Whether we read [Greek: Spoudaiôn daimôn] or [Greek: spoudaiôn           Daimôn] is, for our purposes immaterial. In either case, Verrall           is right in calling attention to the connection between [Greek:           es ta theia spoude] and the [Greek: daimôn Spoudaiôn           (spoudaiôn)], a connection which is now very striking, but which           is utterly lost by inserting the description of a temple. At           this point, then, the temple is not mentioned by Pausanias.             But, if not at this point, perhaps elsewhere, for this also has           been tried. Miss Harrison[9] thinks the temple in question is           mentioned by Pausanias, c. 27.1. He has been describing the           Erechtheion, has just mentioned the old [Greek: agalma] and the           lamp of Kallimachos, which were certainly in the Erechtheion,           [10] and continues: [Greek: kei tai de en tô naô poliados           Ermes xulou, kte.], giving a list of anathemata, followed by the           story of the miraculous growth of the sacred olive after its           destruction by the Persians, and passing to the description of           the Pandroseion with the words, [Greek: tô naô de tes Athenas           Pandrosou naos suneches esti]. Miss Harrison thinks that, since           Athena is Polias, the [Greek: naos tes poliados] and the [Greek           naos tes Athenas] are one and the same, an opinion in which I           heartily concur.[11] It remains to be decided whether this           temple is the newly discovered old temple or the eastern cella           of the Erechtheion. The passages cited by Jahn-Michaelis[12]           show that the old [Greek: agalma] bore the special appellation           [Greek: polias], and we know that the old [Greek: agalma] was in           the Erechtheion. That does not, to be sure, prove that the           Erechtheion was also called, in whole or in part [Greek: naos           tes poliados (or tes Athena)], but it awakens suspicion to read           of an ancient [Greek: agalma] which we know was called Polias,           and which was perhaps the Polias [Greek: kat exochen], and           immediately after, with no introduction or explanation, to read           of a temple of Polias in which that [Greek: agalma] is not.           Nothing is known of a statue in the newly discovered old           temple.[13]             [Footnote 9: _Myth. and Mon. of Athens_, p. 608 ff.]             [Footnote 10: _CIA._, I. 322, § 1 with the passage of           Pausanias.]             [Footnote 11: DÖRPFELD (_Mitth._, XII, p. 58 f.) thinks the           [Greek: naos tes poliados] is the eastern cella of the           Erechtheion, the [Greek: naos tes Athenas] the newly discovered           old temple, but is opposed by Petersen (see below) and Miss           Harrison.]             [Footnote 12: _Pausanias, Descr. Arcis Athen._, c. 26.6.35.]             [Footnote 13: For LOLLING'S opposing opinion, see below.]    Page 6   In the Erechtheion there was, then, a very ancient statue           called Polias; in the temple beside the Erechtheion was no           statue about which anything is known, and yet, according to           Miss Harrison, the new found \"old temple\" is the [Greek: naos           tes poliados] while the [Greek: polias] in bodily form dwells           next door. That seems to me an untenable position. Again, the           dog mentioned by Philochoros[14] which went into the temple of           Polias, and, passing into the Pandroseion, lay down ([Greek:           dusa eis to pandroseion ... catekeito]), can hardly have gone           into the temple alongside of the Erechtheion, because there was           no means of passing from the cella of that temple into the           opisthodomos, and in order to reach the Pandroseion the dog           would have had to come out from the temple by the door by which           he entered it. The fact that the dog went into this temple could           have nothing to do with his progress into the Pandroseion,           whereas from the eastern cella of the Erechtheion he could very           well pass down through the lower apartments and reach the           Pandroseion. It seems after all that when Pausanias says [Greek:           naos tes poliados], he means the eastern cella of the           Erechtheion. But the [Greek: naos tes Athenas] is also the           Erechtheion, for E. Petersen has already observed (_Mitth._ XII,           p. 63) that, if the temple of Pandrosos was [Greek: suneches tô           naô tes Athenas], the temple of Athena must be identified with           the Erechtheion, not with the temple beside it, for the reason           that the temple of Pandrosos, situated west of the Erechtheion,           cannot be [Greek: suneches] (\"adjoining\" in the strict sense of           the word) to the old temple,"]]]
