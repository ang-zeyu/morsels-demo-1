For surely an innocent  person such as I, cannot reconcile himself to being consigned to a place  reserved for criminals and let his life continue.' My plea remained  unanswered. Evidently His Excellency the Haji, is not fully aware of the  truth of our Cause. It would be far more heinous a deed to sadden the  hearts of the faithful, whether men or women, than to lay waste the sacred  House of God.    Verily, the One True God beareth Me witness that in this Day I am the true  mystic Fane of God, and the Essence of all good. He who doeth good unto  Me, it is as if he doeth good unto God, His angels and the entire company  of His loved ones. He who doeth evil unto Me, it is as if he doeth evil  unto God and His chosen ones. Nay, too exalted is the station of God and  of His loved ones for any person's good or evil deed to reach their holy  threshold. Whatever reacheth Me is ordained to reach Me; and that which  hath come unto Me, to him who giveth will it revert. By the One in Whose  hand is My soul, he hath cast no one but himself into prison. For  assuredly whatsoever God hath decreed for Me shall come to pass and naught  else save that which God hath ordained for us shall ever touch us. Woe  betide him from whose hands floweth evil, and blessed the man from whose  hands floweth good. Unto no one do I take My plaint save to God; for He is  the best of judges. Every state of adversity or bliss is from Him alone,  and He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.    In brief, I hold within My grasp whatsoever any man might wish of the good  of this world and of the next. Were I to remove the veil, all would  recognize Me as their Best Beloved, and no one would deny Me. Let not this  assertion astound Your Majesty; inasmuch as a true believer in the unity  of God who keepeth his eyes directed towards Him alone, will regard aught  else but Him as utter nothingness. I swear by God! I seek no earthly goods  from thee, be it as much as a mustard seed. Indeed, to possess anything of  this world or of the next would, in My estimation, be tantamount to open  blasphemy. For it ill beseemeth the believer in the unity of God to turn  his gaze to aught else, much less to hold it in his possession. I know of  a certainty that since I have God, the Ever-Living, the Adored One, I am  the possessor of all things, visible and invisible...    In this mountain I have remained alone, and have come to such a pass that  none of those gone before Me have suffered what I have suffered, nor any  transgressor endured what I have endured! I render praise unto God and yet  again praise Him. I find Myself free from sorrow, inasmuch as I abide  within the good-pleasure of My Lord and Master. Methinks I am in the  all-highest Paradise, rejoicing at My communion with God, the Most Great.  Verily this is a bounty which God hath conferred upon Me; and He is the  Lord of unbounded blessings.    I swear by the truth of God! Wert thou to know that which I know, thou  wouldst forgo the sovereignty of this world and of the next, that thou  mightest attain My good-pleasure, through thine obedience unto the True  One... Wert thou to refuse, the Lord of the world would raise up one who  would exalt His Cause, and the Command of God would, verily, be carried  into effect.    Through the grace of God nothing can frustrate My purpose, and I am fully  conscious of that which God hath bestowed upon Me as a token of His  favour. If it were My will, I would disclose to Your Majesty all things;  but I have not done this, nor will I do it, that the Truth may be  distinguished from aught else beside it, and this prophecy uttered by the  Imam Baqir--may peace rest upon Him--be fully realized: 'What must needs  befall us in A_dh_irbayjan is inevitable and without parallel. When this  happeneth, rest ye in your homes and remain patient as we have remained  patient. As soon as the Mover moveth make ye haste to attain unto Him,  even though ye have to crawl over the snow.'    I implore pardon of God for Myself and for all things related to Me and  affirm, 'Praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds'.          Extracts From Another Epistle To Muhammad Shah      Glory be unto Him Who knoweth all that is in the heavens and in the earth.  Verily there is no God but Him, the sovereign Ruler, the Almighty, the  Great.    He is the One Who on the Day of Severing shall pass judgement through the  power of Truth; indeed no God is there besides Him, the Peerless, the  All-Compelling, the Exalted. He is the One Who holdeth within His grasp  the kingdom of all created things; there is none other God but Him, the  Single, the Incomparable, the Ever-Abiding, the Inaccessible, the Most  Great.    At this moment I testify unto God, even as He testified unto Himself  before the creation of all things: Verily there is no God save Him, the  All-Glorious, the All-Wise. And I bear witness unto whatsoever He hath  fashioned or will fashion, even as He Himself, in the majesty of His  glory, hath borne witness: No God is there but Him, the Peerless, the  Self-Subsisting, the Most Wondrous.    In God, Who is the Lord of all created things, have I placed My whole  trust. There is no God but Him, the Peerless, the Most Exalted. Unto Him  have I resigned Myself and into His hands have I committed all My affairs.  No God is there besides Him, the supreme Ruler, the resplendent Truth.  Indeed all-sufficient is He for Me; independently of all things doth He  suffice, while nothing in the heavens or in the earth but Him sufficeth.  He, in very truth, is the Self-Subsisting, the Most Severe.    Praise be unto Him Who at this very moment perceiveth in this remote  prison the goal of My desire. He is the One Who beareth witness unto Me at  all times and beholdeth Me ere the inception of 'after Hin'.(5)    Why didst thou pronounce judgement without remembering God, the All-Wise?  How canst thou endure in the fire? Indeed, mighty and most severe is thy  God.    Thou pridest thyself in the things thou dost possess, yet no believer in  God and in His signs, nor any righteous man would ever deign to regard  them. This mortal life is like unto the carcass of a dog, around which  none would gather, nor would any partake thereof, except those who gainsay  the life hereafter. Verily it is incumbent upon thee to become a true  believer in God, the All-Possessing, the Almighty, and to turn away from  the one who guideth thee into the torment of hell-fire.    I have been waiting a while that perchance thou wouldst take heed and be  rightly guided. How canst thou answer God on the day which is near at  hand--the day whereon witnesses will stand forth to testify in the presence  of thy Lord, the Lord of all the worlds?    By the righteousness of Him Who hath called thee into being and unto Whom  ere long thou shalt return, if thou remainest, at the moment of death, a  disbeliever in the signs of thy Lord thou shalt surely enter the gates of  hell, and none of the deeds thy hands have wrought will profit thee, nor  shalt thou find a patron nor anyone to plead for thee. Fear thou God and  pride not thyself on thine earthly possessions, inasmuch as what God doth  possess is better for them that tread the path of righteousness.    Verily in this Day all that dwell on earth are the servants of God. As to  those who truly believe in God and are well assured in the signs revealed  by Him, perchance He will graciously forgive them the things their hands  have committed, and will grant them admission into the precincts of His  mercy. He, in truth, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Compassionate. But the  verdict of divine chastisement is pronounced against those who have turned  away disdainfully from Me and have repudiated the conclusive proofs and  the unerring Book with which God hath invested Me, and on the Day of  Severing they shall find no protector or helper.    I swear by Him Who createth all beings and unto Whom all shall return, if  anyone at the hour of death beareth hatred towards Me or disputeth the  clear tokens wherewith I have been invested, then naught but afflictive  torment shall be his lot. On that day no ransom will be accepted, nor will  any intercession be permitted, unless God so please. Verily He is the  All-Compelling, the All-Glorious; and no God is there other than Him, the  sovereign Ruler, the Almighty, the Most Severe.    If thou rejoicest in My imprisonment, woe then unto thee for the grievous  torment which will soon overtake thee. Indeed God hath permitted no one to  pass unfair judgement, and if thou wouldst fain do so, then soon shalt  thou learn.    From the first day that I cautioned thee not to wax proud before God until  the present time, four years have elapsed, and during this space naught  have I witnessed, either from thee or from thy soldiers, except dire  oppression and disdainful arrogance. Methinks thou dost imagine that I  wish to gain some paltry substance from this earthly life. Nay, by the  righteousness of My Lord! In the estimation of them that have fixed their  eyes upon the merciful Lord, the riches of the world and its trappings are  worth as much as the eye of a dead body, nay even less. Far from His glory  be what they associate with Him!... I seek patience only in God. Verily He  is the best protector and the best helper. No refuge do I seek save God.  Verily He is the guardian and the best supporter...    I swear by the glory of God, My Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most Great, He  assuredly, as is divinely ordained, will make His Cause shine resplendent,  while there will be no helper for the unjust. If thou hast any scheme,  produce thy scheme. Indeed every revelation of authority proceedeth from  God. In Him do I trust and unto Him do I turn.    Hast thou heard anyone of old passing a judgement similar to the one thou  didst contrive or like unto that whereto thou didst give thine assent? Woe  then unto the oppressors! Both thine intentions and the manner in which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18833"],[0,"With Clive in India; Or, The Beginnings of an Empire (#4)"],[1,"operation. I used to think it meant cutting off a leg, or  something of that sort, but I see it's much worse.\"    Her uncle looked at her steadily.    \"I am afraid, Grandniece, that you intend to be sarcastic. This is a  hateful habit in a man, worse in a woman. Cure yourself of it as  speedily as possible, or Heaven help the unhappy man who may some day  be your husband.    \"And now,\" he said, \"ring the bell. The housekeeper will show you to  your rooms. My nephew will tell you what are the hours for meals. Of  course, you will want to be gadding about with him. You will  understand that there is no occasion to be in to meals; but if you are  not present when they are upon the table, you will have to wait for  the next. I cannot have my house turned upside down, by meals being  brought up at all sorts of hours.    \"You must not expect me, Niece, to be at your beck and call during the  day, as I have my business to attend to; but of an evening I shall, of  course, feel it my duty to accompany you to the playhouse. It will not  do for you to be going about with only the protection of a  hare-brained boy.\"    The remainder of Charlie's stay in London passed most pleasantly. They  visited all the sights of town, Mr. Tufton performing what he called  his duty with an air of protest, but showing a general thoughtfulness  and desire to please his visitors, which was very apparent even when  he grunted and grumbled the most.    On the evening before he started, he called Charlie down into his  counting house.    \"Tomorrow you are going to sail,\" he said, \"and to start in life on  your own account, and I trust that you will, as far as possible, be  steady, and do your duty to your employers. You will understand that,  although the pay of a writer is not high, there are opportunities for  advancement. The Company have the monopoly of the trade of India, and  in addition to their great factories at Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras,  they have many other trading stations. Those who, by their good  conduct, attract the attention of their superiors, rise to positions  of trust and emolument. There are many who think that the Company  will, in time, enlarge its operations; and as they do so, superior  opportunities will offer themselves; and since the subject of India  has been prominently brought before my notice, I have examined the  question, and am determined to invest somewhat largely in the stock of  the Company, a step which will naturally give me some influence with  the board. That influence I shall, always supposing that your conduct  warrants it, exercise on your behalf.    \"As we are now at war with France, and it is possible that the vessel  in which you are proceeding may be attacked by the way, I have thought  it proper that you should be armed. You will, therefore, find in your  cabin a brace of pistols, a rifle, and a double-barrel shotgun: which  last, I am informed, is a useful weapon at close quarters. Should your  avocations in India permit your doing so, you will find them useful in  the pursuit of game. I hope that you will not be extravagant; but as a  matter of business I find that it is useful to be able to give  entertainments, to persons who may be in a position to benefit or  advance you. I have, therefore, arranged that you will draw from the  factor at Madras the sum of two hundred pounds, annually, in addition  to your pay. It is clearly my duty to see that my nephew has every  fair opportunity for making his way.    \"Now, go upstairs at once to your mother. I have letters to write, and  am too busy for talking.\"    So saying, with a peremptory wave of his hand he dismissed his nephew.    \"Well, Mother,\" Charlie said, after telling her of his uncle's  generosity, \"thank goodness you will be all right now, anyhow. No  doubt Uncle intends to do something for you and the girls, though he  has said nothing at present, beyond the fact that you are not to be in  wretched lodgings, and they are not to go out as governesses. But even  if he should change his mind, and I don't think he ever does that, I  shall be able to help you.    \"Oh, he is kind, isn't he?\"    The parting was far less sad than that which had taken place at  Yarmouth. Charlie was now assured that his mother and sisters would be  comfortable, and well cared for in his absence; while his mother,  happy in the lightening of her anxiety as to the future of her  daughters, and as to the prospects of her son, was able to bear with  better heart the thought of their long separation.    Mrs. Marryat and the girls accompanied him on board ship. Mr. Tufton  declined to join the party, under the plea that, in the first place,  he was busy; and in the second, that he feared there would be an  emotional display. He sent, however, his head clerk with them, to  escort the ladies on their return from the docks.    The Lizzie Anderson was a fine ship, of the largest size, and she was  almost as clean and trim as a man of war. She carried twelve cannon,  two of them thirty-two pounders, which were in those days considered  large pieces of ordnance. All the ships of the Company, and, indeed,  all ocean-going merchantmen of the day, were armed, as the sea swarmed  with privateers, and the black flag of the pirates was still  occasionally to be seen.    The girls were delighted with all they saw, as, indeed, was Charlie;  for accustomed, as they were, only to the coasting vessels which  frequented the port of Yarmouth, this floating castle appeared to them  a vessel of stupendous size and power.    This was Charlie's first visit, also, to the ship, for his uncle had  told him that all directions had been given, that the trunks with the  things necessary for the voyage would be found in his cabin, at the  time of starting, and the rest of the luggage in the hold. Everything  was in order, and Charlie found that his cabin companion was a doctor  in the service, returning to Madras. He was a pleasant man, of some  five or six and thirty, and assured Mrs. Marryat that he would soon  make her son at home on board ship, and would, moreover, put him up to  the ways of things upon his arrival in India. There were many visitors  on board, saying goodbye to their friends, and all sat down to lunch,  served in the saloon.    When this was over, the bell rang for visitors to go ashore. There was  a short scene of parting, in which Charlie was not ashamed to use his  handkerchief as freely as did his mother and sisters. Five minutes  later, the great vessel passed through the dock gates. Charlie stood  at the stern, waving his handkerchief as long as he could catch a  glimpse of the figures of his family; and then as, with her sails  spread and the tide gaining strength every minute beneath her, the  vessel made her way down the river, he turned round to examine his  fellow passengers.    These were some twenty in number, and for the most part men. Almost  all were, in some capacity or other, civil or military, in the service  of the Company; for at that time their monopoly was a rigid one, and  none outside its boundary were allowed to trade in India. The Company  was, indeed, solely a great mercantile house of business. They had  their own ships, their own establishments, and bought and sold goods  like other traders. They owned a small extent of country, round their  three great trading towns; and kept up a little army, composed of two  or three white regiments; and as many composed of natives, trained and  disciplined like Europeans, and known as Sepoys. Hence the clergyman,  the doctor, a member of the council of Madras, four or five military  officers, twice as many civilians, and three young writers, besides  Charlie, were all in the employment of the Company.    \"Well, youngster,\" a cheery voice said beside him, \"take your last  look at the smoke of London, for it will be a good many years before  you see it again, my lad. You've blue skies and clear ones where  you're going, except when it rains, and when it does there is no  mistake about it.\"    The speaker was the captain of the Lizzie Anderson, a fine sailor-like  man of some fifty years, of which near forty had been spent in the  service of the Company.    \"I'm not a Londoner,\" Charlie said, smiling, \"and have no regret for  leaving its smoke. Do you think we shall make a quick voyage?\"    \"I hope so,\" the captain said, \"but it all depends upon the wind. A  finer ship never floated than the Lizzie Anderson; but the Company  don't build their vessels for speed, and it's no use trying to run,  when you meet a Frenchman. Those fellows understand how to build  ships, and if they could fight them as well as they build them, we  should not long be mistress of the sea.\"    Most of the people on board appeared to know each other, and Charlie  felt rather lonely, till the doctor came up and began to chat with  him. He told him who most of his fellow passengers were:    \"That gentleman there, walking on the other side of the deck, as if  not only the ship but the river and banks on both sides belonged to  him, is one of the council. That is his wife over there, with a  companion holding her shawl for her. That pretty little woman, next to  her, is the wife of Captain Tibbets, the tall man leaning against the  bulwarks. Those two sisters are going out to keep house for their  uncle, one of the leading men in Madras; and, I suppose, to get  husbands, which they will most likely do before they have been there  many weeks. They look very nice girls.    \"But you soon get acquainted with them all. It is surprising how soon  people get friendly on board ship, though, as a rule, they quarrel  like cats and dogs before they get to the end of it.\"    \"What do they quarrel about?\" Charlie asked, surprised.    \"Oh, about anything or nothing,\" the doctor said. \"They all get  heartily sick of each other, and of the voyage, and they quarrel  because they have nothing else to do. You will see, we shall be as  happy a party "]]]
