While Murdock refused to ask questions of the major or any  others on that side of the fence, surely he could get some information  from a fellow \"volunteer.\"    \"What is this place, anyway?\" he asked.    The other glanced back over his shoulder. \"Operation Retrograde.\"    Ross swallowed his anger. \"Okay, but what do they do here? Listen, I  just saw a fellow who'd been banged up as if he'd been in a concrete  mixer, creeping along this hall. What sort of work do they do here? And  what do we have to do?\"    To his amazement Ashe smiled, at least his lips quirked faintly. \"Hardy  got under your skin, eh? Well, we have our percentage of failures. They  are as few as it's humanly possible to make, and they give us every  advantage that can be worked out for us----\"    \"Failures at what?\"    \"Operation Retrograde.\"    Somewhere down the hall a buzzer gave a muted whirr.    \"That's mess call. And I'm hungry, even if you're not.\" Ashe walked away  as if Ross Murdock had ceased to exist.    But Ross Murdock did exist, and to him that was an important fact. As he  trailed along behind Ashe he determined that he was going to continue to  exist, in one piece and unharmed, Operation Retrograde or no Operation  Retrograde. And he was going to pry a few enlightening answers out of  somebody very soon.    To his surprise he found Ashe waiting for him at the door of a room from  which came the sound of voices and a subdued clatter of trays and  tableware.    \"Not many in tonight,\" Ashe commented in a take-it-or-leave-it tone.  \"It's been a busy week.\"    The room was rather sparsely occupied. Five tables were empty, while the  men gathered at the remaining two. Ross counted ten men, either already  eating or coming back from a serving hatch with well-filled trays. All  of them were dressed in slacks, shirt, and moccasins like himself--the  outfit seemed to be a sort of undress uniform--and six of them were  ordinary in physical appearance. The other four differed so radically  that Ross could barely conceal his amazement.    Since their fellows accepted them without comment, Ross silently stole  glances at them as he waited behind Ashe for a tray. One pair were  clearly Oriental; they were small, lean men with thin brackets of long  black mustache on either side of their mobile mouths. Yet he had caught  a word or two of their conversation, and they spoke his own language  with the facility of the native born. In addition to the mustaches, each  wore a blue tattoo mark on the forehead and others of the same design on  the backs of their agile hands.    The second duo were even more fantastic. The color of their flaxen hair  was normal, but they wore it in braids long enough to swing across their  powerful shoulders, a fashion unlike any Ross had ever seen. Yet any  suggestion of effeminacy certainly did not survive beyond the first  glance at their ruggedly masculine features.    \"Gordon!\" One of the braided giants swung halfway around from the table  to halt Ashe as he came down the aisle with his tray. \"When did you get  back? And where is Sanford?\"    One of the Orientals laid down the spoon with which he had been  vigorously stirring his coffee and asked with real concern, \"Another  loss?\"    Ashe shook his head. \"Just reassignment. Sandy's holding down Outpost  Gog and doing well.\" He grinned and his face came to life with an  expression of impish humor Ross would not have believed possible. \"He'll  end up with a million or two if he doesn't watch out. He takes to trade  as if he were born with a beaker in his fist.\"    The Oriental laughed and then glanced at Ross. \"Your new partner, Ashe?\"    Some of the animation disappeared from Ashe's brown face; he was  noncommittal again. \"Temporary assignment. This is Murdock.\" The  introduction was flat enough to daunt Ross. \"Hodaki, Feng,\" he  indicated the two Easterners with a nod as he put down his tray.  \"Jansen, Van Wyke.\" That accounted for the blonds.    \"Ashe!\" A man arose at the other table and came to stand beside theirs.  Thin, with a dark, narrow face and restless eyes, he was much younger  than the others, younger and not so well controlled. He might answer  questions if there was something in it for him, Ross decided, and filed  the thought away.    \"Well, Kurt?\" Ashe's recognition was as dampening as it could be, and  Ross's estimation of the younger man went up a fraction when the snub  appeared to have no effect upon him.    \"Did you hear about Hardy?\"    Feng looked as if he were about to speak, and Van Wyke frowned. Ashe  made a deliberate process of chewing and swallowing before he replied.  \"Naturally.\" His tone reduced whatever had happened to Hardy to a  matter-of-fact proceeding far removed from Kurt's implied melodrama.    \"He's smashed up ... kaput....\" Kurt's accent, slight in the beginning,  was thickening. \"Tortured....\"    Ashe regarded him levelly. \"You aren't on Hardy's run, are you?\"    Still Kurt refused to be quashed. \"Of course, I'm not! You know the run  I am in training for. But that is not saying that such can not happen as  well on my run, or yours, or yours!\" He pointed a stabbing finger at  Feng and then at the blond men.    \"You can fall out of bed and break your neck, too, if your number comes  up that way,\" observed Jansen. \"Go cry on Millaird's shoulder if it  hurts you that much. You were told the score at your briefing. You know  why you were picked....\"    Ross caught a faint glance aimed at him by Ashe. He was still totally in  the dark, but he would not try to pry any information from this crowd.  Maybe part of their training was this hush-hush business. He would wait  and see, until he could get Kurt aside and do a little pumping.  Meanwhile he ate stolidly and tried to cover up his interest in the  conversation.    \"Then you are going to keep on saying 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir,' to every  order here----?\"    Hodaki slammed his tattooed hand on the table. \"Why this foolishness,  Kurt? You well know how and why we are picked for runs. Hardy had the  deck stacked against him through no fault of the project. That has  happened before; it will happen again----\"    \"Which is what I have been saying! Do you wish it to happen to you?  Pretty games those tribesmen on your run play with their prisoners, do  they not?\"    \"Oh, shut up!\" Jansen got to his feet. Since he loomed at least five  inches above Kurt and probably could have broken him in two over one  massive knee, his order was one to be considered. \"If you have any  complaints, go make them to Millaird. And, little man\"--he poked a  massive forefinger into Kurt's chest--\"wait until you make that first  run of yours before you sound off so loudly. No one is sent out without  every ounce of preparation he can take. But we can't set up luck in  advance, and Hardy was unlucky. That's that. We got him back, and that  was lucky for him. He'd be the first to tell you so.\" He stretched. \"I'm  for a game--Ashe? Hodaki?\"    \"Always so energetic,\" murmured Ashe, but he nodded as did the small  Oriental.    Feng smiled at Ross. \"Always these three try to beat each other, and so  far all the contests are draws. But we hope ... yes, we have hopes....\"    So Ross had no chance to speak to Kurt. Instead, he was drawn into the  knot of men who, having finished their meal, entered a small arena with  a half circle of spectator seats at one side and a space for contestants  at the other. What followed absorbed Ross as completely as the earlier  scene of the wolf killing. This too was a fight, but not a physical  struggle. All three contenders were not only unlike in body, but as Ross  speedily came to understand, they were also unlike in their mental  approach to any problem.    They seated themselves crosslegged at the three points of a triangle.  Then Ashe looked from the tall blond to the small Oriental. \"Territory?\"  he asked crisply.    \"Inland plains!\" That came almost in chorus, and each man, looking at  his opponent, began to laugh.    Ashe himself chuckled. \"Trying to be smart tonight, boys?\" he inquired.  \"All right, plains it is.\"    He brought his hand down on the floor before him, and to Ross's  astonishment the area around the players darkened and the floor became a  stretch of miniature countryside. Grassy plains rippled under the wind  of a fair day.    \"Red!\"    \"Blue!\"    \"Yellow!\"    The choices came quickly from the dusk masking the players. And upon  those orders points of the designated color came into being as small  lights.    \"Red--caravan!\" Ross recognized Jansen's boom.    \"Blue--raiders!\" Hodaki's choice was only an instant behind.    \"Yellow--unknown factor.\"    Ross was sure that sigh came from Jansen. \"Is the unknown factor a  natural phenomenon?\"    \"No--tribe on the march.\"    \"Ah!\" Hodaki was considering that. Ross could picture his shrug.    The game began. Ross had heard of chess, of war games played with  miniature armies or ships, of games on paper which demand from the  players a quick wit and a trained memory. This game, however, was all  those combined, and more. As his imagination came to life the moving  points of light were transformed into the raiders, the merchants'  caravan, the tribe on the march. There was ingenious deployment, a  battle, a retreat, a small victory here, to be followed by a bigger  defeat there. The game might have gone on for hours. The men about him  muttered, taking sides and arguing heatedly in voices low enough not to  drown out the moves called by the players. Ross was thrilled when the  red traders avoided a very cleverly laid ambush, and indignant when the  tribe was forced to withdraw or the caravan lost points. It was the most  fascinating game he had ever seen, and he realized that the three men  ordering those moves were all masters of strategy. Their respective  skills checkmated each other"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],[0,"Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#4)"],[1,"branches of study in England, which has strongly, or even definitely,  made impression on its younger scholars. While, therefore, I shall  endeavour to point out clearly the characters to be looked for and  admired in the great masters of imaginative design, I shall make no  special effort to stimulate the imitation of them; and above all things,  I shall try to probe in you, and to prevent, the affectation into which  it is easy to fall, even through modesty,--of either endeavouring to  admire a grandeur with which we have no natural sympathy, or losing the  pleasure we might take in the study of familiar things, by considering  it a sign of refinement to look for what is of higher class, or rarer  occurrence.      19. Again, if our artisans were likely to attain any distinguished skill  in ornamental design, it would be incumbent upon me to make my class  here accurately acquainted with the principles of earth and metal work,  and to accustom them to take pleasure in conventional arrangements of  colour and form. I hope, indeed, to do this, so far as to enable them to  discern the real merit of many styles of art which are at present  neglected; and, above all, to read the minds of semi-barbaric nations in  the only language by which their feelings were capable of expression;  and those members of my class whose temper inclines them to take  pleasure in the interpretation of mythic symbols, will not probably be  induced to quit the profound fields of investigation which early art,  examined carefully, will open to them, and which belong to it alone: for  this is a general law, that supposing the intellect of the workman the  same, the more imitatively complete his art, the less he will mean by  it; and the ruder the symbol, the deeper is its intention. Nevertheless,  when I have once sufficiently pointed out the nature and value of this  conventional work, and vindicated it from the contempt with which it is  too generally regarded, I shall leave the student to his own pleasure in  its pursuit; and even, so far as I may, discourage all admiration  founded on quaintness or peculiarity of style; and repress any other  modes of feeling which are likely to lead rather to fastidious  collection of curiosities, than to the intelligent appreciation of work  which, being executed in compliance with constant laws of right, cannot  be singular, and must be distinguished only by excellence in what is  always desirable.      20. While, therefore, in these and such other directions, I shall  endeavour to put every adequate means of advance within reach of the  members of my class, I shall use my own best energy to show them what is  consummately beautiful and well done, by men who have passed through the  symbolic or suggestive stage of design, and have enabled themselves to  comply, by truth of representation, with the strictest or most eager  demands of accurate science, and of disciplined passion. I shall  therefore direct your observation, during the greater part of the time  you may spare to me, to what is indisputably best, both in painting and  sculpture; trusting that you will afterwards recognise the nascent and  partial skill of former days both with greater interest and greater  respect, when you know the full difficulty of what it attempted, and the  complete range of what it foretold.      21. And with this view, I shall at once endeavour to do what has for  many years been in my thoughts, and now, with the advice and assistance  of the curators of the University Galleries, I do not doubt may be  accomplished here in Oxford, just where it will be preeminently  useful--namely, to arrange an educational series of examples of  excellent art, standards to which you may at once refer on any  questionable point, and by the study of which you may gradually attain  an instinctive sense of right, which will afterwards be liable to no  serious error. Such a collection may be formed, both more perfectly, and  more easily, than would commonly be supposed. For the real utility of  the series will depend on its restricted extent,--on the severe  exclusion of all second-rate, superfluous, or even attractively varied  examples,--and On the confining the students' attention to a few types  of what is insuperably good. More progress in power of judgment may be  made in a limited time by the examination of one work, than by the  review of many; and a certain degree of vitality is given to the  impressiveness of every characteristic, by its being exhibited in clear  contrast, and without repetition.    The greater number of the examples I shall choose will be only  engravings or photographs: they shall be arranged so as to be easily  accessible, and I will prepare a catalogue, pointing out my purpose in  the selection of each. But in process of time, I have good hope that  assistance will be given me by the English public in making the series  here no less splendid than serviceable; and in placing minor  collections, arranged on a similar principle, at the command also of the  students in our public schools.      22. In the second place, I shall endeavour to prevail upon all the  younger members of the University who wish to attend the art lectures,  to give at least so much time to manual practice as may enable them to  understand the nature and difficulty of executive skill. The time so  spent will not be lost, even as regards their other studies at the  University, for I will prepare the practical exercises in a double  series, one illustrative of history, the other of natural science. And  whether you are drawing a piece of Greek armour, or a hawk's beak, or a  lion's paw, you will find that the mere necessity of using the hand  compels attention to circumstances which would otherwise have escaped  notice, and fastens them in the memory without farther effort. But were  it even otherwise, and this practical training did really involve some  sacrifice of your time, I do not fear but that it will be justified to  you by its felt results: and I think that general public feeling is also  tending to the admission that accomplished education must include, not  only full command of expression by language, but command of true musical  sound by the voice, and of true form by the hand.      23. While I myself hold this professorship, I shall direct you in these  exercises very definitely to natural history, and to landscape; not only  because in these two branches I am probably able to show you truths  which might be despised by my successors: but because I think the vital  and joyful study of natural history quite the principal element  requiring introduction, not only into University, but into national,  education, from highest to lowest; and I even will risk incurring your  ridicule by confessing one of my fondest dreams, that I may succeed in  making some of you English youths like better to look at a bird than to  shoot it; and even desire to make wild creatures tame, instead of tame  creatures wild. And for the study of landscape, it is, I think, now  calculated to be of use in deeper, if not more important modes, than  that of natural science, for reasons which I will ask you to let me  state at some length.      24. Observe first;--no race of men which is entirely bred in wild  country, far from cities, ever enjoys landscape. They may enjoy the  beauty of animals, but scarcely even that: a true peasant cannot see the  beauty of cattle; but only qualities expressive of their  serviceableness. I waive discussion of this to-day; permit my assertion  of it, under my confident guarantee of future proof. Landscape can only  be enjoyed by cultivated persons; and it is only by music, literature,  and painting, that cultivation can be given. Also, the faculties which  are thus received are hereditary; so that the child of an educated race  has an innate instinct for beauty, derived from arts practised hundreds  of years before its birth. Now farther note this, one of the loveliest  things in human nature. In the children of noble races, trained by  surrounding art, and at the same time in the practice of great deeds,  there is an intense delight in the landscape of their country as  _memorial_; a sense not taught to them, nor teachable to any others;  but, in them, innate; and the seal and reward of persistence in great  national life;--the obedience and the peace of ages having extended  gradually the glory of the revered ancestors also to the ancestral  land; until the Motherhood of the dust, the mystery of the Demeter from  whose bosom we came, and to whose bosom we return, surrounds and  inspires, everywhere, the local awe of field and fountain; the  sacredness of landmark that none may remove, and of wave that none may  pollute; while records of proud days, and of dear persons, make every  rock monumental with ghostly inscription, and every path lovely with  noble desolateness.      25. Now, however checked by lightness of temperament, the instinctive  love of landscape in us has this deep root, which, in your minds, I will  pray you to disencumber from whatever may oppress or mortify it, and to  strive to feel with all the strength of your youth that a nation is only  worthy of the soil and the scenes that it has inherited, when, by all  its acts and arts, it is making them more lovely for its children.    And now, I trust, you will feel that it is not in mere yielding to my  own fancies that I have chosen, for the first three subjects in your  educational series, landscape scenes;--two in England, and one in  France,--the association of these being not without purpose:--and for  the fourth Albert Duerer's dream of the Spirit of Labour. And of the  landscape subjects, I must tell you this much. The first is an engraving  only; the original drawing by Turner was destroyed by fire twenty years  ago. For which loss I wish you to be sorry, and to remember, in  connection with this first example, that whatever remains to us of  "]]]
