But actual sin is more grievous than original sin;  for the lightest punishment is due to original sin, as Augustine says  (Contra Julian. v, 11). Therefore the Incarnation of Christ is  chiefly directed to taking away actual sins.    Obj. 2: Further, pain of sense is not due to original sin, but merely  pain of loss, as has been shown (I-II, Q. 87, A. 5). But Christ came  to suffer the pain of sense on the Cross in satisfaction for  sins--and not the pain of loss, for He had no defect of either the  beatific vision or fruition. Therefore He came in order to take away  actual sin rather than original sin.    Obj. 3: Further, as Chrysostom says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 3):  \"This must be the mind of the faithful servant, to account the  benefits of his Lord, which have been bestowed on all alike, as  though they were bestowed on himself alone. For as if speaking of  himself alone, Paul writes to the Galatians 2:20: 'Christ . . . loved  me and delivered Himself for me.'\" But our individual sins are actual  sins; for original sin is the common sin. Therefore we ought to have  this conviction, so as to believe that He has come chiefly for actual  sins.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (John 1:29): \"Behold the Lamb of  God, behold Him Who taketh away the sins [Vulg.: 'sin'] of the world.\"    _I answer that,_ It is certain that Christ came into this world not  only to take away that sin which is handed on originally to  posterity, but also in order to take away all sins subsequently added  to it; not that all are taken away (and this is from men's fault,  inasmuch as they do not adhere to Christ, according to John 3:19:  \"The light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than  the light\"), but because He offered what was sufficient for blotting  out all sins. Hence it is written (Rom. 5:15-16): \"But not as the  offense, so also the gift . . . For judgment indeed was by one unto  condemnation, but grace is of many offenses unto justification.\"    Moreover, the more grievous the sin, the more particularly did Christ  come to blot it out. But \"greater\" is said in two ways: in one way  \"intensively,\" as a more intense whiteness is said to be greater, and  in this way actual sin is greater than original sin; for it has more  of the nature of voluntary, as has been shown (I-II, Q. 81, A. 1). In  another way a thing is said to be greater \"extensively,\" as whiteness  on a greater superficies is said to be greater; and in this way  original sin, whereby the whole human race is infected, is greater  than any actual sin, which is proper to one person. And in this  respect Christ came principally to take away original sin, inasmuch  as \"the good of the race is a more Divine thing than the good of an  individual,\" as is said _Ethic._ i, 2.    Reply Obj. 1: This reason looks to the intensive greatness of sin.    Reply Obj. 2: In the future award the pain of sense will not be meted  out to original sin. Yet the penalties, such as hunger, thirst,  death, and the like, which we suffer sensibly in this life flow from  original sin. And hence Christ, in order to satisfy fully for  original sin, wished to suffer sensible pain, that He might consume  death and the like in Himself.    Reply Obj. 3: Chrysostom says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 6): \"The  Apostle used these words, not as if wishing to diminish Christ's  gifts, ample as they are, and spreading throughout the whole world,  but that he might account himself alone the occasion of them. For  what does it matter that they are given to others, if what are given  to you are as complete and perfect as if none of them were given to  another than yourself?\" And hence, although a man ought to account  Christ's gifts as given to himself, yet he ought not to consider them  not to be given to others. And thus we do not exclude that He came to  wipe away the sin of the whole nature rather than the sin of one  person. But the sin of the nature is as perfectly healed in each one  as if it were healed in him alone. Hence, on account of the union of  charity, what is vouchsafed to all ought to be accounted his own by  each one.  _______________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 1, Art. 5]    Whether It Was Fitting That God Should Become Incarnate in the  Beginning of the Human Race?    Objection 1: It would seem that it was fitting that God should become  incarnate in the beginning of the human race. For the work of the  Incarnation sprang from the immensity of Divine charity, according to  Eph. 2:4, 5: \"But God (Who is rich in mercy), for His exceeding  charity wherewith He loved us . . . even when we were dead in sins,  hath quickened us together in Christ.\" But charity does not tarry in  bringing assistance to a friend who is suffering need, according to  Prov. 3:28: \"Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again, and tomorrow  I will give to thee, when thou canst give at present.\" Therefore God  ought not to have put off the work of the Incarnation, but ought  thereby to have brought relief to the human race from the beginning.    Obj. 2: Further, it is written (1 Tim. 1:15): \"Christ Jesus came into  this world to save sinners.\" But more would have been saved had God  become incarnate at the beginning of the human race; for in the  various centuries very many, through not knowing God, perished in  their sin. Therefore it was fitting that God should become incarnate  at the beginning of the human race.    Obj. 3: Further, the work of grace is not less orderly than the work  of nature. But nature takes its rise with the more perfect, as  Boethius says (De Consol. iii). Therefore the work of Christ ought to  have been perfect from the beginning. But in the work of the  Incarnation we see the perfection of grace, according to John 1:14:  \"The Word was made flesh\"; and afterwards it is added: \"Full of grace  and truth.\" Therefore Christ ought to have become incarnate at the  beginning of the human race.    _On the contrary,_ It is written (Gal. 4:4): \"But when the fulness of  the time was come, God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the  law\": upon which a gloss says that \"the fulness of the time is when  it was decreed by God the Father to send His Son.\" But God decreed  everything by His wisdom. Therefore God became incarnate at the most  fitting time; and it was not fitting that God should become incarnate  at the beginning of the human race.    _I answer that,_ Since the work of the Incarnation is principally  ordained to the restoration of the human race by blotting out sin, it  is manifest that it was not fitting for God to become incarnate at  the beginning of the human race before sin. For medicine is given  only to the sick. Hence our Lord Himself says (Matt. 9:12, 13): \"They  that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill . . .  For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.\"    Nor was it fitting that God should become incarnate immediately after  sin. First, on account of the manner of man's sin, which had come of  pride; hence man was to be liberated in such a manner that he might  be humbled, and see how he stood in need of a deliverer. Hence on the  words in Gal. 3:19, \"Being ordained by angels in the hand of a  mediator,\" a gloss says: \"With great wisdom was it so ordered that  the Son of Man should not be sent immediately after man's fall. For  first of all God left man under the natural law, with the freedom of  his will, in order that he might know his natural strength; and when  he failed in it, he received the law; whereupon, by the fault, not of  the law, but of his nature, the disease gained strength; so that  having recognized his infirmity he might cry out for a physician, and  beseech the aid of grace.\"    Secondly, on account of the order of furtherance in good, whereby we  proceed from imperfection to perfection. Hence the Apostle says (1  Cor. 15:46, 47): \"Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that  which is natural; afterwards that which is spiritual . . . The first  man was of the earth, earthy; the second man from heaven, heavenly.\"    Thirdly, on account of the dignity of the incarnate Word, for on the  words (Gal. 4:4), \"But when the fulness of the time was come,\" a  gloss says: \"The greater the judge who was coming, the more numerous  was the band of heralds who ought to have preceded him.\"    Fourthly, lest the fervor of faith should cool by the length of time,  for the charity of many will grow cold at the end of the world. Hence  (Luke 18:8) it is written: \"But yet the Son of Man, when He cometh,  shall He find think you, faith on earth?\"    Reply Obj. 1: Charity does not put off bringing assistance to a  friend: always bearing in mind the circumstances as well as the state  of the persons. For if the physician were to give the medicine at the  very outset of the ailment, it would do less good, and would hurt  rather than benefit. And hence the Lord did not bestow upon the human  race the remedy of the Incarnation in the beginning, lest they should  despise it through pride, if they did not already recognize their  disease.    Reply Obj. 2: Augustine replies to this (De Sex Quest. Pagan., Ep.  cii), saying (Q. 2) that \"Christ wished to appear to man and to have  His doctrine preached to them when and where He knew those were who  would believe in Him. But in such times and places as His Gospel was  not preached He foresaw that not all, indeed, but many would so bear  themselves towards His preaching as not to believe in His corporeal  presence, even were He to raise the dead.\" But the same Augustine,  taking exception to this reply in his book (De Perseverantia ix),  says: \"How can we say the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon would not  believe when such great wonders were wrought in their midst, or would  not have believed had they been wrought, when God Himself bears  witness that they would have done penance "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19953"],[0,"Origin and Development of Form and Ornament in Ceramic Art. (#4)"],[1,"sources, let me give a  single example by which it will be seen that not only elementary forms  but even so highly constituted an ornament as the scroll may have been  brought thus naturally into the realm of decorative art. The sea-shell  has always been intimately associated with the arts that utilize clay  and abounds in suggestions of embellishment. The _Busycon_ was almost  universally employed as a vessel by the tribes of the Atlantic drainage  of North America. Usually it was trimmed down and excavated until only  about three-fourths of the outer wall of the shell remained. At one end  was the long spike-like base which served as a handle, and at the other  the flat conical apex, with its very pronounced spiral line or ridge  expanding from the center to the circumference, as seen in Fig. 475 _a_.  This vessel was often copied in clay, as many good examples now in our  museums testify. The notable feature is that the shell has been copied  literally, the spiral appearing in its proper place. A specimen is  illustrated in Fig. 475 _b_ which, although simple and highly  conventionalized, still retains the spiral figure.    [Illustration: _a_ _b_ _c_ FIG. 476.--Possible derivation of the  current scroll.]    In another example we have four of the noded apexes placed about the rim  of the vessel, as shown in Fig. 476_a_, the conception being that of  four conch shells united in one vessel, the bases being turned inward  and the apexes outward. Now it is only necessary to suppose the addition  of the spiral lines, always associated with the nodes, to have the  result shown in _b_, and by a still higher degree of convention we have  the classic scroll ornament given in _c_. Of course, no such result as  this could come about adventitiously, as successful combination calls  for the exercise of judgment and taste; but the initiatory steps could  be taken--the motive could enter art--without the conscious supervision  of the human agent.      +SUGGESTIONS BY FEATURES OF ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS.+    [Illustration: FIG. 477.--Ornament derived through the modification of  handles.]    _Functional features_.--Functional features of art products liable to  influence ornament comprise handles, legs, feet, rims, bands, and other  peculiarities of shape originating in utility. Handles, for instance,  may have been indigenous to a number of arts; they are coeval and  coextensive with culture. The first load, weapon, or vessel transported  by man may have been suspended by a vine or filament. Such arts as have  fallen heir to handles have used them according to the capacities of the  material employed. Of all the materials stone is probably the least  suited to their successful use, while clay utilizes them in its own  peculiar way, giving to them a great variety of expression. They are  copied in clay from various models, but owing to the inadequate  capacities of the material, often lose their function and degenerate  into mere ornaments, which are modified as such to please the potter's  fancy. Thus, for example, the series of handles placed about the neck of  the vessel become, by modification in frequent copying, a mere band of  ornamental figures in relief, or even finally in engraved, punctured, or  painted lines, in the manner suggested in Fig. 477. Legs, pedestals,  spouts, and other features may in a like manner give rise to decoration.    [Illustration: _a._--Coiled fillet of clay. _b._--Double coil.  FIG. 478.--Scroll derived from coil of clay.]      _Constructional features._-Features of vessels resulting from  construction are infinitely varied and often highly suggestive of  decoration. Constructional peculiarities of the clay utensils themselves  are especially worthy of notice, and on account of their actual presence  in the art itself are more likely to be utilized or copied for ceramic  ornament than those of other materials. The coil, so universally  employed in construction, has had a decided influence upon the ceramic  decoration of certain peoples, as I have shown in a paper on ancient  Pueblo art. From it we have not only a great variety of surface  ornamentation produced by simple treatment of the coil in place, but  probably many forms suggested by the use of the coil in vessel building,  as, for instance, the spiral formed in beginning the base of a coiled  vessel, Fig. 478 _a_, from which the double scroll _b_, as a separate  feature, could readily be derived, and finally the chain of scrolls so  often seen in border and zone decoration. This familiarity with the use  of fillets or ropes of clay would also lead to a great variety of  applied ornament, examples of which, from Pueblo art, are given in Fig.  479. The sinuous forms assumed by a rope of clay so employed would  readily suggest to the Indian the form of the serpent and the means of  representing it, and might thus lead to the introduction of this much  revered creature into art.    [Illustration: FIG. 479.--Ornamental use of fillets.]    Of the various classes of utensils associated closely with the ceramic  art, there are none so characteristically marked by constructional  features as nets and wicker baskets. The twisting, interlacing,  knotting, and stitching of filaments give relieved figures that by  contact in manufacture impress themselves upon the plastic clay. Such  impressions come in time to be regarded as pleasing features, and when  free-hand methods of reproducing are finally acquired they and their  derivatives become essentials of decoration. At a later stage these  characters of basketry influence ceramic decoration in a somewhat  different way. By the use of variously-colored fillets the woven surface  displays figures in color corresponding to those in relief and varying  with every new combination. Many striking patterns are thus produced,  and the potter who has learned to decorate his wares by the stylus or  brush reproduces these patterns by free-hand methods. We find pottery in  all countries ornamented with patterns, painted, incised, stamped, and  relieved, certainly derived from this source. So well is this fact known  that I need hardly go into details.    In the higher stages of art the constructional characters of  architecture give rise to many notions of decoration which afterwards  descend to other arts, taking greatly divergent forms. Aboriginal  architecture in some parts of America had reached a development capable  of wielding a strong influence. This is not true, however, of any part  of the United States.      +SUGGESTIONS OF ACCIDENTS.+    Besides the suggestions of surface features impressed in manufacture or  intentionally copied as indicated above, we have also those of  accidental imprints of implements or of the fingers in manufacture. From  this source there are necessarily many suggestions of ornament, at first  of indented figures, but later, after long employment, extending to the  other modes of representation.      +IDEOGRAPHIC AND PICTORIAL SUBJECTS.+    Non-ideographic forms of ornament may originate in ideographic features,  mnemonic, demonstrative, or symbolic. Such significant figures are  borrowed by decorators from other branches of art. As time goes on they  lose their significance and are subsequently treated as purely  decorative elements. Subjects wholly pictorial in character, when such  come to be made, may also be used as simple decoration, and by long  processes of convention become geometric.    The exact amount of significance still attached to significant figures  after adoption into decoration cannot be determined except in cases of  actual identification by living peoples, and even when the signification  is known by the more learned individuals the decorator may be wholly  without knowledge of it.            MODIFICATION OF ORNAMENT.      There are comparatively few elementary ideas prominently and generally  employed in primitive decorative art. New ideas are acquired, as already  shown, all along the pathway of progress. None of these ideas retain a  uniform expression, however, as they are subject to modification by  environment just as are the forms of living organisms. A brief  classification of the causes of modification is given in the following  synopsis:                                    /Through material.  Modification of ornament------|Through form.                                \\Through, methods of realization.      _Through material._--It is evident at a glance that _material_ must have  a strong influence upon the forms assumed by the various decorative  motives, however derived. Thus stone, clay, wood, bone, and copper,  although they readily borrow from nature and from each other,  necessarily show different decorative results. Stone is massive and  takes form slowly and by peculiar processes. Clay is more versatile and  decoration may be scratched, incised, painted, or modeled in relief with  equal facility, while wood and metal engender details having characters  peculiar to themselves, producing different results from the same  motives or elements. Much of the diversity displayed by the art products  of different countries and climates is due to this cause.    Peoples dwelling in arctic climates are limited, by their materials, to  particular modes of expression. Bone and ivory as shaped for use in the  arts of subsistence afford facilities for the employment of a very  restricted class of linear decoration, such chiefly as could be  scratched with a hard point upon small irregular, often cylindrical,  implements. Skins and other animal tissues are not favorable to the  development of ornament, and the textile arts--the greatest agents of  convention--do not readily find suitable materials in which to work.    Decorative art carried to a high stage under arctic environment would be  more likely to achieve unconventional and realistic forms than if  developed in more highly favored countries. The accurate geometric and  linear patterns would"]]]
