At  the command front, turn the head and eyes to the front. Notice the right  file does not turn the eyes to the right.        FACINGS      To the flank: 1. Right (left), 2. FACE.    [Illustration]    Raise slightly the left heel and right toe; face to the right, turning  on the right heel, assisted by a slight pressure on the ball of the left  foot; place the left foot by the side of the right. Left face is  executed on the left heel in the corresponding manner.    Right (left) Half Face is executed similarly, facing 45 deg..    To the rear: 1. About, 2. FACE.    Carry the toe of the right foot about a half foot-length to the rear and  slightly to the left of the left heel without changing the position of  the left foot; face to the rear, turning to the right on the left heel  and right toe; place the right heel by the side of the left. There is no  left about face.        STEPS AND MARCHINGS      All steps and marchings executed from a halt, except right step, begin  with the left foot.    The length of the full step in quick time is 30 inches, measured from  heel to heel, and the cadence is at the rate of 120 steps per minute.    The length of the full step in double time is 36 inches; the cadence is  at the rate of 180 steps per minute.    The instructor, when necessary, indicates the cadence of the step by  calling one, two, three, four, or left, right, the instant the left and  right foot, respectively, should be planted.    All steps and marchings and movements involving march are executed in  quick time unless the squad be marching in double time, or double  time be added to the command; in the latter case double time is added  to the preparatory command. Example: 1. Squad right, double time, 2.  MARCH (School of the Squad).        QUICK TIME      Being at a halt, to march forward in quick time: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.    At the command forward, shift the weight of the body to the right leg,  left knee straight.    At the command march, move the left foot smartly straight forward 30  inches from the right, sole near the ground, and plant it without shock;  next, in like manner, advance the right foot and plant it as above;  continue the march. The arms swing naturally.    Being at a halt, or in march in quick time, to march in double time: 1.  Double time, 2. MARCH.    If at a halt, at the first command shift the weight of the body to the  right leg. At the command march, raise the forearms, fingers closed, to  a horizontal position along the waist line; take up an easy run with the  step and cadence of double time, allowing a natural swinging motion to  the arms.    If marching in quick time, at the command march, given as either foot  strikes the ground, take one step in quick time, and then step off in  double time.    To resume the quick time: 1. Quick time, 2. MARCH.    At the command march, given as either foot strikes the ground, advance  and plant the other foot in double time; resume the quick time, dropping  the hands by the sides.        TO MARK TIME      Being in march: 1. Mark time, 2. MARCH. At the command march, given as  either foot strikes the ground, advance and plant the other foot; bring  up the foot in rear and continue the cadence by alternately raising each  foot about 2 inches and planting it on line with the other.    Being at a halt, at the command march, raise and plant the feet as  prescribed above. Common errors are to raise the feet several inches and  to run up the cadence, i.e., go too fast.    1. Half step, 2. MARCH.    Take steps of 15 inches in quick time, 18 inches in double time.    Forward, half step, halt, and mark time may be executed one from the  other in quick or double time. Any step less than the full step (i.e.,  half step, right step, or backward) is apt to be too fast, i.e., greater  than 120 steps a minute.    To resume the full step from half step or mark time: 1. Forward, 2.  MARCH.        SIDE STEP      Being at a halt or mark time: 1. Right (left) step, 2. MARCH.    Carry and plant the right foot 15 inches to the right; bring the left  foot beside it and continue the movement in the cadence of quick time.    The side step is used for short distances only and is not executed in  double time.    If at order arms, the side step is executed at trail without command.        BACK STEP      Being at a halt or mark time: 1. Backward, 2. MARCH.    Take steps of 15 inches straight to the rear.    The back step is used for short distances only and is not executed in  double time.    If at order arms, the back step is executed at trail without command.        TO HALT      To arrest the march in quick or double time: 1. Squad, 2. HALT.    At the command halt, given as either foot strikes the ground, plant the  other foot as in marching; raise and place the first foot by the side of  the other. If in double time, drop the hands by the sides.        TO MARCH BY THE FLANK      Being in march: 1. By the right (left) flank, 2. MARCH.    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]    The command march must be given when the right foot is on the ground as  shown in No. 1. Then advance and plant the left foot and turn on the  toes to right as shown in No. 2, and step off with the right foot.        TO MARCH TO THE REAR      Being in march: 1. To the rear, 2. MARCH.    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]    At the command march, given as the right foot strikes the ground,  advance and plant the left foot; turn to the right about on the balls of  both feet and immediately step off with the left foot.    The turn is made on the toes as shown.    The command march must be given when the right foot is on the ground.  The left foot is then advanced to the position shown.    If marching in double time, turn to the right about, taking four steps  in place, keeping the cadence, and then step off with the left foot.        CHANGE STEP      Being in march; 1. Change step, 2. MARCH.    At the command march, given as the right foot strikes the ground,  advance and plant the left foot; plant the toe of the right foot near  the heel of the left and step off with the left foot.    The change on the right foot is similarly executed, the command march  being given as the left foot strikes the ground.        MANUAL OF ARMS      To acquire proficiency in the Manual of Arms, you should practice,  practice, and practice.    Position of order arms standing, i.e., the position of attention under  arms.    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]    No. 1. Arm and hands hang naturally. Right hand holding piece between  thumb and fingers. Butt rests evenly on ground. Barrel to the rear.    No. 2. Toe of the butt on a line with toe of and touching the right  shoe.    To execute the movements in detail, the instructor first cautions: \"By  the Numbers\"; all movements divided into motions, are then executed  singly. That is to say, make one motion and then wait until a further  command for another. This is for the purpose of correcting erroneous  positions and giving detailed instructions. We are explaining the manual  by the numbers.    [Illustration: FIRST POSITION OF PRESENT ARMS FROM ORDER ARMS]    Being at order arms: 1. Present, 2. ARMS. It takes two counts.    At command arms, with the right hand carry the piece in front of the  center of the body. Barrel to the rear and vertical. Grasp it with left  hand at the balance. Left forearm is horizontal and rests against body.  The balance of the piece is approximately the position of the rear  sight.    [Illustration: CORRECT POSITION OF PRESENT ARMS]    At command two, grasp the small of the stock with the right hand.    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No. 3    INCORRECT POSITION OF PRESENT ARMS    These are the common errors made by beginners.]    No. 1. Thumb along barrel.    No. 2. Piece held too low. The front sight will be a little above the  eyes when the left fore arm is horizontal.    No. 3. Piece not vertical; too close to body.        Being at order arms: 1. Port, 2. ARMS. It takes one count.    [Illustration: CORRECT POSITION OF PORT ARMS]    At the command ARMS, with the right hand raise and throw the piece  diagonally across the body, grasp it smartly with both hands; the right;  palm down, at the small of stock; the left, palm up, at the balance;  barrel up, sloping to the left and crossing opposite the junction of the  neck with the left shoulder; right forearm horizontal; left forearm  resting against the body. The rifle is held in a vertical plane parallel  to the front.    In executing this movement, it is a common error with beginners to raise  the piece as though it weighed much more than it does. No part of the  body should move except the arms, in coming to \"port arms\" from \"order  arms.\"    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No. 3 INCORRECT POSITIONS OF PORT ARMS]    No. 1. Arms held away from side.    No. 2. Piece held too low and too close to body.    No. 3. Piece held too high and not in a vertical plane parallel to the  body.    Being at present arms: 1. Port, 2. ARMS. It is executed in one count. At  the command arms, carry the piece diagonally across the body and take  the position of \"port arms.\"    Being at port arms: 1. Present, 2. ARMS. It is executed in one count. At  the command arms, carry the piece to a vertical position in front of the  center of the body and take the position of present arms.    Being at present or port arms: 1. Order, 2. ARMS. It is executed in two  counts.    [Illustration: NEXT TO THE LAST POSITION OF ORDER ARMS]    At the command arms, let go with the right hand; lower and carry the  piece to the right with the left hand; regrasp it with the right hand  just above the lower band; let go with the left hand and take the  position shown here, which is the next to the last position in coming to  the order. The left hand should be above and near the right, steadying  the gun, fingers extended and joined, forearm and wrist straight and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19560"],[0,"Applied Eugenics (#4)"],[1,"were reared under not very dissimilar  conditions, either grow unlike through the development of natural [that  is, inherited] characteristics which had lain dormant at first, or else  they continue their lives, keeping time like two watches, hardly to be  thrown out of accord except by some physical jar.\"    Here was a distinct failure of nurture to modify the inborn nature. We  next consider the ordinary twins who were unlike from the start. Galton  had twenty such cases, given with much detail. \"It is a fact,\" he  observes, \"that extreme dissimilarity, such as existed between Jacob and  Esau, is a no less marked peculiarity of twins of the same sex than  extreme similarity.\" The character of the evidence as a whole may be  fairly conveyed by a few quotations:    (1) One parent says: \"They have had _exactly the same nurture_ from  their birth up to the present time; they are both perfectly healthy and  strong, yet they are otherwise as dissimilar as two boys could be,  physically, mentally, and in their emotional nature.\"    (2) \"I can answer most decidedly that the twins have been perfectly  dissimilar in character, habits, and likeness from the moment of their  birth to the present time, though they were nursed by the same woman,  went to school together, and were never separated until the age of  thirteen.\"    (3) \"They have never been separated, never the least differently treated  in food, clothing, or education; both teethed at the same time, both had  measles, whooping cough, and scarlatina at the same time, and neither  has had any other serious illness. Both are and have been exceedingly  healthy, and have good abilities; yet they differ as much from each  other in mental cast as any one of my family differs from another.\"    (4) \"Very dissimilar in mind and body; the one is quiet, retiring, and  slow but sure; good-tempered, but disposed to be sulky when  provoked;--the other is quick, vivacious, forward, acquiring easily and  forgetting soon; quick-tempered and choleric, but quickly forgiving and  forgetting. They have been educated together and never separated.\"    (5) \"They were never alike either in mind or body, and their  dissimilarity increases daily. The external influences have been  identical; they have never been separated.\"    (6) \"The two sisters are very different in ability and disposition. The  one is retiring, but firm and determined; she has no taste for music or  drawing. The other is of an active, excitable temperament; she displays  an unusual amount of quickness and talent, and is passionately fond of  music and drawing. From infancy, they have been rarely separated even at  school, and as children visiting their friends, they always went  together.\"    And so on. Not a single case was found in which originally dissimilar  characters became assimilated, although submitted to exactly the same  influences. Reviewing the evidence in his usual cautious way, Galton  declared, \"There is no escape from the conclusion that nature prevails  enormously over nurture, when the differences of nurture do not exceed  what is commonly to be found among persons of the same rank in society  and in the same country.\"    This kind of evidence was a good start for eugenics but as the science  grew, it outgrew such evidence. It no longer wanted to be told, no  matter how minute the details, that \"nature prevails enormously over  nurture.\" It wanted to know exactly how much. It refused to be satisfied  with the statement that a certain quantity was large; it demanded that  it be measured or weighed. So Galton, Karl Pearson and other  mathematicians devised means of doing this, and then Professor Edward L.  Thorndike of Columbia University took up Galton's problem again, with  more refined methods.    The tool used by Professor Thorndike was the coefficient of correlation,  which shows the amount of resemblance or association between any two  things that are capable of measurement, and is expressed in the form of  a decimal fraction somewhere between 0 and the unit 1. Zero shows that  there is no constant resemblance at all between the two things  concerned,--that they are wholly independent of each other, while 1  shows that they are completely dependent on each other, a condition that  rarely exists, of course.[4] For instance, the correlation between the  right and left femur in man's legs is .98.    Professor Thorndike found in the New York City schools fifty pairs of  twins of about the same age and measured the closeness of their  resemblance in eight physical characters, and also in six mental  characters, the latter being measured by the proficiency with which the  subjects performed various tests. Then children of the same age and sex,  picked at random from the same schools, were measured in the same way.  It was thus possible to tell how much more alike twins were than  ordinary children in the same environment.[5]    [Illustration: THE EFFECT OF NURTURE IN CHANGING NATURE    FIG. 2.--Corn of a single variety (Leaming Dent) grown in two  plots: at the left spaced far apart in hills, at the right crowded. The  former grows to its full potential height, the latter is stunted. The  size differences in the two plots are due to differences in environment,  the heredity in both cases being the same. Plants are much more  susceptible to nutritional influences on size than are mammals, but to a  less degree nutrition has a similar effect on man. Photograph from A. F.  Blakeslee.]    \"If now these resemblances are due to the fact that the two members of  any twin pair are treated alike at home, have the same parental models,  attend the same school and are subject in general to closely similar  environmental conditions, then (1) twins should, up to the age of  leaving home, grow more and more alike, and in our measurements the  twins 13 and 14 years old should be much more alike than those 9 and 10  years old. Again (2) if similarity in training is the cause of  similarity in mental traits, ordinary fraternal pairs not over four or  five years apart in age should show a resemblance somewhat nearly as  great as twin pairs, for the home and school condition of a pair of the  former will not be much less similar than those of a pair of the latter.  Again, (3) if training is the cause, twins should show greater  resemblance in the case of traits much subject to training, such as  ability in addition or multiplication, than in traits less subject to  training, such as quickness in marking off the A's on a sheet of printed  capitals, or in writing the opposites of words.\"    The data were elaborately analyzed from many points of view. They showed  (1) that the twins 12-14 years old were not any more alike than the  twins 9-11 years old, although they ought to have been, if environment  has great power to mold the character during these so-called \"plastic  years of childhood.\" They showed (2) that the resemblance between twins  was two or three times as great as between ordinary children of the same  age and sex, brought up under similar environment. There seems to be no  reason, except heredity, why twins should be more alike. The data showed  (3) that the twins were no more alike in traits subject to much training  than in traits subject to little or no training. Their achievement in  these traits was determined by their heredity; training did not  measurably alter these hereditary potentialities.    \"The facts,\" Professor Thorndike wrote, \"are easily, simply and  completely explained by one simple hypothesis; namely, that the nature  of the germ-cells--the conditions of conception--cause whatever  similarities and differences exist in the original natures of men, that  these conditions influence mind and body equally, and that in life the  differences in modification of mind and body produced by such  differences as obtain between the environments of present-day New York  City public school children are slight.\"    \"The inferences,\" he says, \"with respect to the enormous importance of  original nature in determining the behavior and achievements of any man  in comparison with his fellows of the same period of civilization and  conditions of life are obvious. All theories of human life must accept  as a first principle the fact that human beings at birth differ  enormously in mental capacities and that these differences are largely  due to similar differences in their ancestry. All attempts to change  human nature must accept as their most important condition the limits  set by original nature to each individual.\"    Meantime other investigators, principally followers of Karl Pearson in  England, were working out correlation coefficients in other lines of  research for hundreds of different traits. As we show in more detail in  Chapter IV, it was found, no matter what physical or mental trait was  measured, that the coefficient of correlation between parent and child  was a little less than .5 and that the coefficient between brother and  brother, or sister and sister, or brother and sister, was a little more  than .5. On the average of many cases the mean \"nature\" value, the  coefficient of direct heredity, was placed at .51. This gave another  means of measuring nurture, for it was also possible to measure the  relation between any trait in the child and some factor in the  environment. A specific instance will make this clearer.    Groups of school children usually show an appalling percentage of  short-sightedness. Now suppose it is suggested that this is because they  are allowed to learn to read at too early an age. One can find out the  age at which any given child did learn to read, and work out the  coefficient of correlation between this age and the child's amount of  myopia. If the relation between them is very close--say .7 or .8--it  will be evident that the earlier a child learns to read, the more  short-sighted he is as he grows older. This will not prove a relation of  cause and"]]]
