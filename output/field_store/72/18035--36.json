The strokes can then be counted  and the individual scores recorded. The experiment should be repeated  several times, say six or eight, and the average score for each  individual recorded.    [Illustration: FIGURE I.--STROKES MADE IN THIRTY SECONDS  A test of muscular speed]    Whether the result in such a performance as this varies from day to day,  and is accidental, or whether it is constant and fundamental, can be  determined by repeating the experiment from day to day. This repetition  will also show whether improvement comes from practice.    If it is decided to repeat the experiment in order to study these  factors, constancy and the effects of practice, some method of studying  and interpreting the results must be found. Elaborate methods of doing  this are known to psychologists, but the beginner must use a simpler  method. When the experiment is performed for the first time, the  students can be ranked with reference to their abilities, the fastest  one being called \"first,\" the second highest, \"second,\" and so on down  to the slowest performer. Then after the experiment has been performed  the second time, the students can be again ranked.    A rough comparison can then be made as follows: Determine how many who  were in the best half in the first experiment are among the best half in  the second experiment. If most who were among the best half the first  time are among the best half in the second experiment, constancy in this  performance is indicated. Or we might determine how many change their  ranks and how much they change. Suppose there are thirty in the class  and only four improve their ranks and these to the extent of only two  places each. This would indicate a high degree of constancy. Two  different performances can be compared as above described. The abilities  on successive days can be determined by taking the average rank of the  first day and comparing it with the average rank of the second day.    If the effects of practice are to be studied, the experiments must be  kept up for many days, and each student's work on the first day compared  with his work on succeeding days. Then a graph can be plotted to show  the improvement from day to day. The average daily speed of the class  can be taken and a graph made to show the improvement of the class as a  whole. This might be plotted in black ink, then each individual student  could put on his improvement in red ink, for comparison. A group of  thirty may be considered as furnishing a fair average or norm in this  kind of performance.    In connection with this simple performance, making marks as fast as  possible, it is evident that many problems arise. It would take several  months to solve anything like all of them. It might be interesting, for  example, to determine whether one's speed in writing is related to this  simple speed in marking. Each member of the class might submit a plan  for making such a study.    The foregoing simple study illustrates the procedure of psychology in  all experimentation. A psychological experiment is an attempt to find  out the truth in regard to some aspect of human nature. In finding out  this truth, we must throw about the experiment all possible safeguards.  Every source of error must be discovered and eliminated. In the above  experiment, for example, the work must be done at the same time of day,  or else we must prove that doing it at different times of day makes no  difference. Nothing must be taken for granted, and nothing must be  assumed. Psychology, then, is like all the other sciences, in that its  method of getting its facts is by observation and experiment.      SUMMARY. Science is systematic, related knowledge. Each science has    a particular field which it attempts to explore and describe. The    field of psychology is the study of sensitivity, action, and    consciousness, or briefly, human behavior. Its main problems are    development, heredity, instincts, habits, sensation, memory,    thinking, and individual differences. Its method is observation and    experiment, the same as in all other sciences.      CLASS EXERCISES    1. Make out a list of things about human nature which you would like to  know. Paste your list in the front of this book, and as you find your  questions answered in this book, or in other books which you may read,  check them off.

CHAPTER II    DEVELOPMENT OF THE RACE AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL      =Racial Development.= The purpose of this chapter is to make some inquiry  concerning the origin of the race and of the individual. In doing this,  it is necessary for us first of all to fix in our minds the idea of  causality. According to the view of all modern science, everything has a  cause. Nothing is uncaused. One event is the result of other previous  events, and is in turn the cause of other events that follow. Yesterday  flowed into to-day, and to-day flows into to-morrow. The world as it  exists to-day is the result of the world as it existed yesterday. This  is true not only of the inorganic world--the world of physics and  chemistry--but it is true of living things as well. The animals and  plants that exist to-day are the descendants of others that lived  before. There is probably an unbroken line of descent from the first  life that existed on the earth to the living forms of to-day.    Not only does the law of causality hold true in the case of our bodies,  but of our minds as well. Our minds have doubtless developed from  simpler minds just as our bodies have developed from simpler bodies.  That different grades and types of minds are to be found among the  various classes of animals now upon the earth, no one can doubt, for the  different forms certainly show different degrees of mentality.  According to the evidence of those scientists who have studied the  remains of animals found in the earth's crust, there is a gradual  development of animal forms shown in successive epochs. In the very  oldest parts of the earth's crust, the remains of animal life found are  very simple. In later formations, the remains show an animal life more  complex. The highest forms of animals, the mammals, are found only in  the more recent formations. The remains of man are found only in the  latest formations.    Putting these two facts together--(1) that the higher types of mind are  found to-day only in the higher types of animals, and (2) that a gradual  development of animal forms is shown by the remains in the earth's  crust--the conclusion is forced upon us that mind has passed through  many stages of development from the appearance of life upon the earth to  the present time. Among the lower forms of animals to-day one sees  evidence of very simple minds. In amoebas, worms, insects, and fishes,  mind is very simple. In birds, it is higher. In mammals, it is higher  still. Among the highest mammals below man, we see manifestations of  mind somewhat like our own. These grades of mentality shown in the  animals of to-day represent the steps in the development of mind in the  animals of the past.    We cannot here go into the proof of the doctrine of development. For  this proof, the reader must be referred to zooelogy. One further point,  however, may be noted. If it is difficult for the reader to conceive of  the development of mind on the earth similar to the development of  animals in the past, let him think of the development of mind in the  individual. There can certainly be no doubt of the development of mind  in an individual human being. The infant, when born, shows little  manifestation of mentality; but as its body grows, its mind develops,  becoming more and more complex as the individual grows to maturity.    =The World as Dynamic.= The view of the world outlined above, and held by  all scientific men of the present time, may be termed the _dynamic_  view. Man formerly looked upon the world as static, a world where  everything was fixed and final. Each thing existed in itself and for  itself, and in large measure independent of all other things. We now  look upon things and events as related and dependent. Each thing is  dependent upon others, related to others.    Man not only _lives in_ such a world, but is _part of_ such a world. In  this world of constant and ceaseless change, man is most sensitive and  responsive. Everything may affect him. To all of the constant changes  about him he must adjust himself. He has been produced by this world,  and to live in it he must meet its every condition and change. We must,  then, look upon human nature as something coming out of the past and as  being influenced every moment by the things and forces of the present.  Man is not an independent being, unaffected by everything that happens;  on the contrary, he is affected by all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18485"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#4)"],[1,"on wid Old Marster for a little while atter de war was over,  and den right away Mammy died and Daddy hired me out to Mrs. Sidney  Rives (Reaves?). I 'spects one reason she was so mighty good to me was  'cause I was so little den. I was nigh grown when I left her to wuk for  Dr. Palmer's fambly. All his chillun was little den and I was deir nuss.  One of de best of his chillun was little Miss Eunice. She is done growed  to be a school teacher and dey tells me she is still a-teachin'. It  warn't long atter my Daddy died dat I left de Palmers and started  wukkin' for Mr. Dock Dorsey's fambly. If dere ever was a good Christian  'oman in dis here old world it was Miss Sallie Dorsey, Mr. Dock Dorsey's  wife. She had been Miss Sallie Chappell 'fore she married Mr. Dorsey.  Miss Sallie tried to git evvybody what stayed 'round her to live right  too, and she wanted all her help to go to church reg'lar. If Miss Sallie  and Marse Dock Dorsey was livin' now, dey would pervide for Old 'Delia  jus' lak dey used to do. All deir chillun was nice. Miss Fannie and Miss  Sue, dey was extra good gals, but somehow I jus' can't call back de  names of dem other ones now. Dey all had to be good wid de sort of mammy  and daddy dey had. Miss Sallie, she was sick a long time 'fore she died,  and dey let me wait on her. Missy, I tell you de gospel truth, I sho'  did love dat 'oman. Not long 'fore she passed on to Heben, she told her  husband dat atter she was gone, she wanted him to marry up wid her  cousin, Miss Hargrove, so as he would have somebody to help him raise up  her chillun, and he done 'zactly what she axed him to. All of my own  white folkses has done died out, and Old 'Delia won't be here much  longer. One of de Thorntons here--I forgits which one--married up wid my  young Mist'ess, Rebecca Jackson. Her gal got married up wid Dr. Jago, a  horse-doctor. A insurance man named Mr. Speer married into de Jackson  fambly too. He moved his fambly from here to de mountains on account of  his son's health, and I jus' los' track of 'em den.    \"Lordy, Chile! What you want to know 'bout my weddin' for, nowhow? Dere  ain't never gwine to be no more weddin's lak dey had back dere in dem  times 'cause folkses thinks dey got to have too much nowadays. When  folkses got married den dey was a-thinkin' 'bout makin' sho' 'nough  homes for deyselfs, and gittin' married meant somepin sort of holy.  Mammy said dat most times when slaves got married dey jus' jumped  backwards over a broomstick whilst deir Marster watched and den he  pernounced dat dey was man and wife. Now dey is got to go to de  courthouse and pay out good money for a license and den go git a  preacher or somebody lak a jestice jedge to say de marriage words over  'em.    \"Me and Solomon Thomas had to go buy us a license too, but us didn't  mind 'bout 'puttin out 'dat money cause us was so much in love. I wore a  pretty white dress and a breakfast shawl, and atter us had done went to  de preacher man's house and got married, us come right on here to dis  very house what had b'longed to Solomon's daddy 'fore it was Solomon's.  Us built two more rooms on de house, but all de time Solomon lived us  tried to keep de place lookin' a good deal lak it was de day us got  married.    \"Atter Solomon died, I sold off most of de land to de railroad for de  right of way for dat dere track what you sees out dere, and it sho' has  made plenty of wuk for me to keep dat soot what dem engines is all time  a-spittin' out cleaned off my things in de house. It draps down through  dem big holes overhead, and I can't git hold of no money to have de roof  patched up.    \"Me and Solomon, us had 11 chillun, but dey is all daid out but three.  One of my boys is in Baltimore and another boy lives in Louisiana  somewhar. My gal, Delia, she stays over in de Newtown part of Athens  here. She would love to help her old Mammy, but my Delia's got chillun  of her own and she can't git nothin' to do 'cept a little washin' for de  white folkses, and she ain't able to pervide what her own household  needs to eat. Dem boys of mine is done got so fur off dey's done forgot  all 'bout deir old Mammy.    \"When us fust got married, Solomon wukked at Mr. Orr's cotton house, and  he stayed dere a long time 'fore he went to wuk for Mr. Moss and Mr.  Levy. All dem white folks was good to me and Solomon. I kept on wukkin'  for de Dorseys 'til us had so many chillun I had to stay home and look  atter 'em. Solomon got sick and he lay dere sufferin' a long, long time,  but Mr. Moss and Mr. Levy seed dat he didn't want for nothin'. Even  atter Solomon died dem good white mens kept on comin' out now and den to  see if me and Solomon's chillun had what us needed.    \"Solomon, my Solomon, he went out of dis here world, in dat dere room  whar you sees dat old bed, and dat is perzactly whar I wants to be when  de Blessed Lord lays his hands on me and tells me to come on Home to  Glory. I wants to be toted out of dat room, through dis hall and on out  to de graveyard jus' lak my man was. I knows dat evvything would be done  nice jus' lak I wants it if Mr. Moss and Mr. Levy was a-livin' 'cause  dey was both Masons, and members of de Masons is all done swore a oath  to look atter deir own folkses. Dey said Solomon and his fambly was lak  deir own folkses, Mr. Moss and Mr. Levy did. Most of de folkses, both  white and black, dat I has knowed and loved has done gone on over de  Jordan, out of dis world of trouble, and it will be happy days for all  of us when us meets again in de place 'of many mansions' whar dere won't  be nothin' for none of us to pester ourselfs 'bout no more.    \"All of my life, I'se had a great desire to travel, jus' to go evvywhar,  but atter all dese years of busy livin' I 'spects all de trav'lin' I'll  ever do will be on de road to Glory.

Talkin' to  you has been a heap of consolation to me.\"        [HW: Dist-2  Ex Slave #105]  Alberta Minor  Re-search Worker    FOLKLORE  EX-SLAVE--IKE THOMAS  Heidt Bridges Farm near Rio Georgia  Interviewed    September 4, 1936  [Date Stamp: MAY 8 1937]    [TR: This interview contained many handwritten edits; where text was  transposed or meaning was significantly changed, it has been noted.]      Ike Thomas was born near Monticello in Jasper County on the Thomas  plantation. His mother and father were sold when he was a little boy,  and \"Missus\" Thomas, in picking her house boy, took Ike to raise for a  carriage boy. She picked her little niggers by the way they wore their  hats. If they set them on the back of their heads, they grew up to be  \"high-minded\", but if they pulled them over their eyes, they'd grow up  to be \"sneaky and steal\".    Mrs. Thomas let him sleep on a trundle bed pulled out at night and put  under her bed in the day and fed him under the table. She'd put a piece  of meat in a biscuit and hand it down to him and warned him if they had  company not to holler when he was thru so he'd touch her on the knee but  his mouth was so big and he'd eat so fast that he \"jes kep' on teching  her on the knee.\"    During the war, when they got word the Yankees were coming, Mrs. Thomas  would hide her \"little niggers\" sometimes in the wardrobe back of her  clothes, sometimes between the mattresses, or sometimes in the cane  brakes. After the Yankees left, she'd ring a bell and they would know  they could come out of hiding. (When they first heard the slaves were  free, they didn't believe it so they just stayed on with their \"white  folks\".) [HW: Transpose to page 3.]    If the negroes were mean or ran away, they would be chased by hounds and  brought back for punishment.    When still a young man, Ike ran away with a negro couple coming in a  buggy to Blanton Mill near Griffin and worked for Mr. William Blanton  until he died. After he had been here a while, he got married. His  wife's people had the wedding supper and party. He was a fiddler so had  to fiddle most all night then the next day his \"white folks\" gave him  the food for the wedding dinner that he had at his own house.    Ike says every seven [HW: 7] years the locusts come and its sure to be  a short crop that \"God sends all sorts of cusses\" (curses) sometimes  its the worms that eat the cotton or the corn or the bugs that eat the  wheat. He doesn't believe in \"hants\" or \"conjurin'\". It seems Sid  Scott was a \"mean nigger\", [HW: and] everyone was afraid of [HW: him].  He was cut in two by the saw mill and after his funeral whenever  anyone pass his house at night that could hear his \"hant\" going  \"rat-a-tat-tat-bang, bang, bang\" like feet running.    One night when Ike was coming home from \"fiddlin'\" at a white folks  party, he had to pass Scott's house. Now they kept the cotton seed in  half of the house and the other half was empty. When Ike got close, he  made a racket and sure enough the noise started. \"The moon was about an  hour up\" and he saw these funny white things run out from under the  house and scatter. It scared him at first but he looked and looked and  saw they were sheep that [HW: having] found a hole into the cotton seed  would go in at night to eat.    Before the war the negroes had a big celebration on the 4th of July, a  big barbecue, ball game, wrestling matches, lots of music and singing.  They had to have a pass from their Masters to attend and pay to get in.  The \"patta-roll\" came by to see your pass and if you didn't have one,  they'd whip you and send you home. [HW: When the Negroes first heard  that they were free, they didn't believe it so they just stayed on with  their white folks.]    After he came to Blanton's, the Negroes could come and go as they  pleased for they were free.
