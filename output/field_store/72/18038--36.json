And Beethoven himself does not seem to have regarded his pianoforte  works with the same satisfaction as his other compositions. At least,  he wrote the following curious sentence in a corner of one of his  sketch books in 1805; \"Heaven knows why my pianoforte music always  makes the worst impression on me, especially when it is played badly.\"  He must have felt that his ideas found a much more appropriate and  adequate expression in the orchestra than on the piano. Not being a  radical innovator he did not, in his treatment of the pianoforte, go  beyond Clementi; and so it remained for Chopin to show the world that  the pianoforte, if properly treated, will yield tones whose exquisite  sensuous beauty can hardly be surpassed by any combination of  orchestral instruments.    The two principal means by which he accomplished these reforms were  the constant employment of the pedal, and the use of extended and  scattered chords, in place of the crowded harmonies and the massive  movements of the older accompaniments.    Very few pianists seem to comprehend the exact function and importance  of the pedal. Many will be surprised to hear that the word \"touch,\"  which they suppose refers to the way the keys are struck by the  fingers, has quite as much to do with the feet--that is, the use of  the pedal--as with the fingers. No matter how thoroughly a pianist may  have trained his fingers, if he does not use the pedal as it was used  by Chopin and Schumann, he cannot reveal the poetry of their  compositions. In one of his letters Chopin notes that Thalberg played  _forte_ and _piano_ with the pedals, not with his hands, and some  piano bangers do so still; but every pianist who deserves the name  knows that loudness and softness must be regulated by the hands (and  very rarely the left-side pedal). Yet even among this better class of  pianists the notion seems to prevail that the main object of the  right-side pedal is to enable them to prolong a chord or to prevent a  confusion of consecutive harmonies. This is one of the functions of  the pedal, no doubt, but not the most important one. The chief service  of the pedal is _in the interest of tone-color_. Let me explain.    Every student of music knows that if you sing a certain tone into a  piano (after pressing the pedal), or before a guitar, the strings in  these instruments which correspond to the tone you sing will vibrate  responsively and emit a tone. He also knows that when you sound a  single note, say G, on the violin or piano, you seem to hear only a  simple tone, but on listening more closely you will find that it is  really a compound tone or a complete chord, the fundamental tone being  accompanied by faint overtones, which differ in number and relative  loudness in different instruments, and to which these instruments owe  their peculiar tone-color.    Now when you press the pedal of a pianoforte on striking a note you do  not only prolong this note, but its vibrations arouse all the notes  which correspond to its overtones, and the result is a rich deep  tone-color of exquisite sensuous beauty and enchanting variableness.  Hence, whenever the melodic movement and harmonic changes are not too  rapid, a pianist should press the pedal _constantly_, whether he plays  loudly or softly; because it is only when the damper is raised from  the strings that the overtones can enrich and beautify the sound by  causing their corresponding strings to vibrate in sympathy with them.  Those who heard Schumann play say that he used the pedal persistently,  sometimes twice in the same bar to avoid harmonic confusion; and the  same is true of Chopin, concerning whose playing an English amateur  says, after referring to his _legatissimo_ touch: \"The wide arpeggios  in the left hand, _maintained in a continuous stream of tone_ by the  strict legato and fine and constant use of the damper pedal, formed an  harmonious substructure for a wonderfully poetic _cantabile_.\"    I have italicised and emphasized the words _maintained in a continuous  stream of tone_, because it calls attention to one of the numerous  resemblances between the style of Chopin and that of Wagner, who in  his music dramas similarly keeps up an uninterrupted flow of richly  colored harmonies to sustain the vocal part. Schumann relates that he  had the good fortune to hear Chopin play some of his etudes. \"And he  played them very much _a la Chopin_,\" he says: \"Imagine an AEolian harp  provided with all the scales, commingled by an artist's hand into all  manner of fantastic, ornamental combinations, yet in such a way that  you can always distinguish a deeper ground tone and a sweet continuous  melody above--and you have an approximate idea of his playing. No  wonder that I liked best those of the etudes which he played for me,  and I wish to mention specially the first one, in A flat major, a poem  rather than an etude. It would be a mistake to imagine that he allowed  each of the small notes to be distinctly audible; it was rather a  surging of the A flat major chord, occasionally raised to a new billow  by the pedal; but amid these harmonies a wondrous melody asserted  itself in large tones, and only once, toward the middle of the piece,  a tenor part came out prominently beside the principal melody. After  hearing this etude you feel as you do when you have seen a ravishing  picture in your dreams and, half awake, would fain recall it.\"    Now it is obvious that such dreamy AEolian-harp-like harmonies could  not have been produced without Chopin's novel and constant use of the  pedal. And this brings out the greatest difference between the new and  the old style of playing. In the pianoforte works of Mozart and  Beethoven, and even in those of Weber, which mark the transition from  the classical to the romantic school, there are few passages that  absolutely require a pedal, and in most cases the pieces sound almost  as well without as with pedal; so that, from his point of view, and in  his days of staccato playing, Hummel was quite right in insisting that  a pianist could not be properly judged until he played without the  pedal. But as regards the romantic school of Chopin, Schumann, Liszt  and their followers, it may be said with equal truth that a pianist's  use of the pedal furnishes the supreme test of his talent. If he has  not the delicacy of ear which is requisite to produce the \"continuous  stream of tone\" in Chopin's compositions, without the slightest  harmonic confusion, he should leave them alone and devote himself to  less poetic composers.    An amusing anecdote illustrates visibly how helpless Chopin would have  been without his pedal. He was asked one evening at a party in Paris  to play. He was quite willing to do so but discovered to his surprise  that the piano had no pedals. They had been sent away for repairs. In  this dilemma a happy thought occurred to Liszt, who happened to be  present. He crawled under the piano, and, while Chopin was playing,  worked the mechanism to which the pedals ought to have been attached  so cleverly that they were not missed at all! He stooped that his  friend might conquer.    The fact that Chopin in his later works, often omitted the sign for  the pedal on his MSS. must not be held to indicate that he did not  wish it to be constantly used. In his earlier works he carefully  indicated where it should be employed, but subsequently he appears to  have reasoned rightly that a pianist who needs to be told where the  pedal ought, and where it ought not, to be employed, is not  sufficiently advanced in culture to play his works at all, and had  therefore best leave them alone.    Chopin's remarkable genius for divining the mysteries of the  pianoforte enabled him, as it were, to anticipate what is a  comparatively recent invention--the middle pedal which is chiefly used  to sustain single tones in the bass without affecting the rest of the  instrument. The melancholy \"F sharp minor Prelude,\" for example,  cannot be played properly without the use of this middle pedal. In  another prelude, we have an illustration of how the pedal must often  be used in order to help in forming a chord which cannot be stretched.  And this brings us to the second important innovation in the treatment  of Chopin's pianoforte--the constant use of scattered and extended  chords.    Karasovski relates that Chopin, a mere boy, used to amuse himself by  searching on the piano for harmonies of which the constituent notes  were widely scattered on the keyboard, and, as his hands were too  small to grasp them, he devised a mechanism for stretching his hands,  which he wore at night. Fortunately, he did not go so far as Schumann,  who made similar experiments with his hands and thereby disabled one  of them for life. What prompted Chopin to search for these widely  extended chords was his intense appreciation of tonal beauty. To-day  everybody knows how much more beautiful scattered, and widely extended  harmonies are than crowded harmonies; but it was Chopin's genius that  discovered this fact and applied it on a large scale. Indeed, so novel  were his chords, that at first, many of them were deemed unplayable;  but he showed that if his own system of fingering was adopted, they  were not only playable, but eminently suited to the character of the  instrument. The superior beauty of scattered intervals can be  strikingly demonstrated in this way. If you strike four or five  adjacent notes on the piano at once, you produce an intolerable  cacophony. But these same notes can be so arranged by scattering them  that they make an exquisite chord in suspension. Everything depends on  the arrangement and the wideness of the intervals. Chopin's fancy was  inexhaustible in the discovery of new kinds of scattered chords,  combined into harmony by his novel"]]]
