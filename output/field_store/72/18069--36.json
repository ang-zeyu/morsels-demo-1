[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906"],[0,"Erewhon; Or, Over the Range (#4)"],[1," approached this last, if it did  not reach it.  I tried to be amused, but I felt a sort of creeping at the  roots of my hair and over my whole body, as I looked and wondered what he  could possibly be intending to signify.  He continued thus for about a  minute, sitting bolt upright, as stiff as a stone, and making this  fearful face.  Then there came from his lips a low moaning like the wind,  rising and falling by infinitely small gradations till it became almost a  shriek, from which it descended and died away; after that, he jumped down  from the bale and held up the extended fingers of both his hands, as one  who should say \"Ten,\" though I did not then understand him.    For myself I was open-mouthed with astonishment.  Chowbok rolled the  bales rapidly into their place, and stood before me shuddering as in  great fear; horror was written upon his face--this time quite  involuntarily--as though the natural panic of one who had committed an  awful crime against unknown and superhuman agencies.  He nodded his head  and gibbered, and pointed repeatedly to the mountains.  He would not  touch the grog, but, after a few seconds he made a run through the wool-  shed door into the moonlight; nor did he reappear till next day at dinner-  time, when he turned up, looking very sheepish and abject in his civility  towards myself.    Of his meaning I had no conception.  How could I?  All I could feel sure  of was, that he had a meaning which was true and awful to himself.  It  was enough for me that I believed him to have given me the best he had  and all he had.  This kindled my imagination more than if he had told me  intelligible stories by the hour together.  I knew not what the great  snowy ranges might conceal, but I could no longer doubt that it would be  something well worth discovering.    I kept aloof from Chowbok for the next few days, and showed no desire to  question him further; when I spoke to him I called him Kahabuka, which  gratified him greatly: he seemed to have become afraid of me, and acted  as one who was in my power.  Having therefore made up my mind that I  would begin exploring as soon as shearing was over, I thought it would be  a good thing to take Chowbok with me; so I told him that I meant going to  the nearer ranges for a few days' prospecting, and that he was to come  too.  I made him promises of nightly grog, and held out the chances of  finding gold.  I said nothing about the main range, for I knew it would  frighten him.  I would get him as far up our own river as I could, and  trace it if possible to its source.  I would then either go on by myself,  if I felt my courage equal to the attempt, or return with Chowbok.  So,  as soon as ever shearing was over and the wool sent off, I asked leave of  absence, and obtained it.  Also, I bought an old pack-horse and  pack-saddle, so that I might take plenty of provisions, and blankets, and  a small tent.  I was to ride and find fords over the river; Chowbok was  to follow and lead the pack-horse, which would also carry him over the  fords.  My master let me have tea and sugar, ship's biscuits, tobacco,  and salt mutton, with two or three bottles of good brandy; for, as the  wool was now sent down, abundance of provisions would come up with the  empty drays.    Everything being now ready, all the hands on the station turned out to  see us off, and we started on our journey, not very long after the summer  solstice of 1870.          CHAPTER III: UP THE RIVER      The first day we had an easy time, following up the great flats by the  river side, which had already been twice burned, so that there was no  dense undergrowth to check us, though the ground was often rough, and we  had to go a good deal upon the river-bed.  Towards nightfall we had made  a matter of some five-and-twenty miles, and camped at the point where the  river entered upon the gorge.    The weather was delightfully warm, considering that the valley in which  we were encamped must have been at least two thousand feet above the  level of the sea.  The river-bed was here about a mile and a half broad  and entirely covered with shingle over which the river ran in many  winding channels, looking, when seen from above, like a tangled skein of  ribbon, and glistening in the sun.  We knew that it was liable to very  sudden and heavy freshets; but even had we not known it, we could have  seen it by the snags of trees, which must have been carried long  distances, and by the mass of vegetable and mineral _debris_ which was  banked against their lower side, showing that at times the whole river-  bed must be covered with a roaring torrent many feet in depth and of  ungovernable fury.  At present the river was low, there being but five or  six streams, too deep and rapid for even a strong man to ford on foot,  but to be crossed safely on horseback.  On either side of it there were  still a few acres of flat, which grew wider and wider down the river,  till they became the large plains on which we looked from my master's  hut.  Behind us rose the lowest spurs of the second range, leading  abruptly to the range itself; and at a distance of half a mile began the  gorge, where the river narrowed and became boisterous and terrible.  The  beauty of the scene cannot be conveyed in language.  The one side of the  valley was blue with evening shadow, through which loomed forest and  precipice, hillside and mountain top; and the other was still brilliant  with the sunset gold.  The wide and wasteful river with its ceaseless  rushing--the beautiful water-birds too, which abounded upon the islets  and were so tame that we could come close up to them--the ineffable  purity of the air--the solemn peacefulness of the untrodden region--could  there be a more delightful and exhilarating combination?    We set about making our camp, close to some large bush which came down  from the mountains on to the flat, and tethered out our horses upon  ground as free as we could find it from anything round which they might  wind the rope and get themselves tied up.  We dared not let them run  loose, lest they might stray down the river home again.  We then gathered  wood and lit the fire.  We filled a tin pannikin with water and set it  against the hot ashes to boil.  When the water boiled we threw in two or  three large pinches of tea and let them brew.    We had caught half a dozen young ducks in the course of the day--an easy  matter, for the old birds made such a fuss in attempting to decoy us away  from them--pretending to be badly hurt as they say the plover does--that  we could always find them by going about in the opposite direction to the  old bird till we heard the young ones crying: then we ran them down, for  they could not fly though they were nearly full grown.  Chowbok plucked  them a little and singed them a good deal.  Then we cut them up and  boiled them in another pannikin, and this completed our preparations.    When we had done supper it was quite dark.  The silence and freshness of  the night, the occasional sharp cry of the wood-hen, the ruddy glow of  the fire, the subdued rushing of the river, the sombre forest, and the  immediate foreground of our saddles packs and blankets, made a picture  worthy of a Salvator Rosa or a Nicolas Poussin.  I call it to mind and  delight in it now, but I did not notice it at the time.  We next to never  know when we are well off: but this cuts two ways,--for if we did, we  should perhaps know better when we are ill off also; and I have sometimes  thought that there are as many ignorant of the one as of the other.  He  who wrote, \"O fortunatos nimium sua si bona norint agricolas,\" might have  written quite as truly, \"O infortunatos nimium sua si mala norint\"; and  there are few of us who are not protected from the keenest pain by our  inability to see what it is that we have done, what we are suffering, and  what we truly are.  Let us be grateful to the mirror for revealing to us  our appearance only.    We found as soft a piece of ground as we could--though it was all  stony--and having collected grass and so disposed of ourselves that we  had a little hollow for our hip-bones, we strapped our blankets around us  and went to sleep.  Waking in the night I saw the stars overhead and the  moonlight bright upon the mountains.  The river was ever rushing; I heard  one of our horses neigh to its companion, and was assured that they were  still at hand; I had no care of mind or body, save that I had doubtless  many difficulties to overcome; there came upon me a delicious sense of  peace, a fulness of contentment which I do not believe can be felt by any  but those who have spent days consecutively on horseback, or at any rate  in the open air.    Next morning we found our last night's tea-leaves frozen at the bottom of  the pannikins, though it was not nearly the beginning of autumn; we  breakfasted as we had supped, and were on our way by six o'clock.  In  half an hour we had entered the gorge, and turning round a corner we bade  farewell to the last sight of my master's country.    The gorge was narrow and precipitous; the river was now only a few yards  wide, and roared and thundered against rocks of many tons in weight; the  sound was deafening, for there was a great volume of water.  We were two  hours in making less than a mile, and that with danger, sometimes in the  river and sometimes on the rock.  There was that damp black smell of  rocks covered with slimy vegetation, as near some huge waterfall where  spray is ever rising.  The air was clammy and cold.  I cannot conceive  how our horses managed to keep their footing, especially the one with the  pack, and I dreaded the having to return almost as much as going forward.  I suppose this lasted three miles, but it was well midday when the gorge  got a little wider, and a small stream came into it from a tributary  valley.  Farther progress up the main river was impossible, for the  cliffs descended like "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#4)"],[1,"were barricaded,  balconies and battlements lined with men in shining mail, bearing the  fantastic device of their leader on helm and shield. Mangonels, or  catapults, huge engines stationed on the roofs of the towers, sent  masses of stone hurtling through the air, whistling arbelast bolts and  clothyard shafts flew in thick showers, boiling oil or lead rained down  on the heads of those who ventured down to attack the doors, and arrows,  with Greek fire attached, were shot with nice aim into the wooden  balconies and bridges. Vile insults were hurled where missiles failed to  strike. The shouts and shrieks of the combatants were mingled with the  crash of a falling tower or with the hissing of a fire-arrow. Where  those struck, a red glow arose and a thick cloud of smoke enveloped the  defenders.    Altho it is evident that towers were very numerous in Pisa, it is  difficult to arrive at their precise number. The chroniclers differ  greatly in their estimates. Benjamin da Tudela, for instance, says that  there were 10,000 in the twelfth century; while Marangone puts the  number at 15,000 and Tronci at 16,000. These are round numbers such as  the medieval mind loved, but we have abundant evidence that they are not  much exaggerated. An intarsia panel in the Duomo, shows how closely the  towers were packed together, while the mass of legislation relating to  them was directed against abuses that could only have arisen if their  number was very large.          V    NAPLES AND ITS ENVIRONS          IN AND ABOUT THE CITY[6]    BY CHARLES DICKENS      So we go, rattling down-hill, into Naples. A funeral is coming up the  street, toward us. The body, on an open bier, borne on a kind of  palanquin, covered with a gay cloth of crimson and gold. The mourners,  in white gowns and masks. If there be death abroad, life is well  represented too, for all Naples would seem to be out of doors, and  tearing to and fro in carriages. Some of these, the common Vetturino  vehicles, are drawn by three horses abreast, decked with smart trappings  and great abundance of brazen ornament, and always going very fast. Not  that their loads are light; for the smallest of them has at least six  people inside, four in front, four or five more hanging behind, and two  or three more, in a net or bag below the axle-tree, where they lie  half-suffocated with mud and dust.    Exhibitors of Punch, buffo singers with guitars, reciters of poetry,  reciters of stories, a row of cheap exhibitions with clowns and  showmen, drums, and trumpets, painted cloths representing the wonders  within, and admiring crowds assembled without, assist the whirl and  bustle. Ragged lazzaroni lie asleep in doorways, archways, and kennels;  the gentry, gaily drest, are dashing up and down in carriages on the  Chiaja, or walking in the Public Gardens; and quiet letter-writers,  perched behind their little desks and inkstands under the Portico of the  Great Theater of San Carlo, in the public street, are waiting for  clients.    Why do the beggars rap their chins constantly, with their right hands,  when you look at them? Everything is done in pantomime in Naples, and  that is the conventional sign for hunger. A man who is quarreling with  another, yonder, lays the palm of his right hand on the back of his  left, and shakes the two thumbs--expressive of a donkey's ears--whereat  his adversary is goaded to desperation. Two people bargaining for fish,  the buyer empties an imaginary waistcoat pocket when he is told the  price, and walks away without a word, having thoroughly conveyed to the  seller that he considers it too dear. Two people in carriages, meeting,  one touches his lips, twice or thrice, holding up the five fingers of  his right hand, and gives a horizontal cut in the air with the palm. The  other nods briskly, and goes his way. He has been invited to a friendly  dinner at half-past five o'clock, and will certainly come.    All over Italy, a peculiar shake of the right hand from the wrist, with  the forefinger stretched out, expresses a negative--the only negative  beggars will ever understand. But, in Naples, those five fingers are a  copious language. All this, and every other kind of out-door life and  stir, and maccaroni-eating at sunset, and flower-selling all day long,  and begging and stealing everywhere and at all hours, you see upon the  bright sea-shore, where the waves of the Bay sparkle merrily....    Capri--once made odious by the deified beast Tiberius--Ischia, Procida,  and the thousand distant beauties of the Bay, lie in the blue sea  yonder, changing in the mist and sunshine twenty times a day; now close  at hand, now far off, now unseen. The fairest country in the world, is  spread about us. Whether we turn toward the Miseno shore of the splendid  watery amphitheater, and go by the Grotto of Posilipo to the Grotto del  Cane and away to Baiae, or take the other way, toward Vesuvius and  Sorrento, it is one succession of delights. In the last-named direction,  where, over doors and archways, there are countless little images of San  Gennaro, with this Canute's hand stretched out, to check the fury of the  burning Mountain, we are carried pleasantly, by a railroad on the  beautiful Sea Beach, past the town of Torre del Greco, built upon the  ashes of the former town destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius, within a  hundred years; and past the flat-roofed houses, granaries, and maccaroni  manufacturies; to Castellamare, with its ruined castle, now inhabited by  fishermen, standing in the sea upon a heap of rocks.    Here, the railroad terminates; but, hence we may ride on, by an unbroken  succession of enchanting bays, and beautiful scenery, sloping from the  highest summit of Saint Angelo, the highest neighboring mountain, down  to the water's edge--among vineyards, olive-trees, gardens of oranges  and lemons, orchards, heaped-up rocks, green gorges in the hills--and by  the bases of snow-covered heights, and through small towns with  handsome, dark-haired women at the doors--and pass delicious summer  villas--to Sorrento, where the poet Tasso drew his inspiration from the  beauty surrounding him. Returning, we may climb the heights above  Castellamare, and looking down among the boughs and leaves, see the  crisp water glistening in the sun; and clusters of white houses in  distant Naples, dwindling, in the great extent of prospect, down to  dice. The coming back to the city, by the beach again, at sunset; with  the glowing sea on one side, and the darkening mountain (Vesuvius), with  its smoke and flame, upon the other, is a sublime conclusion to the  glory of the day.    That church by the Porta Capuna--near the old fisher-market in the  dirtiest quarter of dirty Naples, where the revolt of Masaniello  began--is memorable for having been the scene of one of his earliest  proclamations to the people, and is particularly remarkable for nothing  else, unless it be its waxen and bejeweled Saint in a glass case, with  two odd hands; or the enormous number of beggars who are constantly  rapping their chins there, like a battery of castanets. The cathedral  with the beautiful door, and the columns of African and Egyptian granite  that once ornamented the temple of Apollo, contains the famous sacred  blood of San Gennaro or Januarius, which is preserved in two phials in a  silver tabernacle, and miraculously liquefies three times a year, to the  great admiration of the people. At the same moment, the stone (distant  some miles) where the Saint suffered martyrdom, becomes faintly red. It  is said that the officiating priests turn faintly red also, sometimes,  when these miracles occur.    The old, old men who live in hovels at the entrance of these ancient  catacombs, and who, in their age and infirmity, seem waiting here, to be  buried themselves, are members of a curious body, called the Royal  Hospital, who are the official attendants at funerals. Two of these old  specters totter away, with lighted tapers, to show the caverns of  death--as unconcerned as if they were immortal. They were used as  burying-places for three hundred years; and, in one part, is a large pit  full of skulls and bones, said to be the sad remains of a great  mortality occasioned by a plague. In the rest, there is nothing but  dust. They consist, chiefly, of great wide corridors and labyrinths,  hewn out of the rock. At the end of some of these long passages, are  unexpected glimpses of the daylight, shining down from above. It looks  as ghastly and as strange; among the torches, and the dust, and the dark  vaults; as if it, too, were dead and buried.    The present burial-place lies out yonder, on a hill between the city and  Vesuvius. The old Campo Santo with its three hundred and sixty-five  pits, is only used for those who die in hospitals, and prisons, and are  unclaimed by their friends. The graceful new cemetery, at no great  distance from it, tho yet unfinished, has already many graves among its  shrubs and flowers, and airy colonnades. It might be reasonably objected  elsewhere, that some of the tombs are meretricious and too fanciful; but  the general brightness seems to justify it here; and Mount Vesuvius,  separated from them by a lovely slope of ground, exalts and saddens the  scene.    If it be solemn to behold from this new City of the Dead, with its dark  smoke hanging in the clear sky, how much more awful and impressive is  it, viewed from the ghostly ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii!    Stand at the bottom of the great market-place of Pompeii, and look up  the silent streets, through the ruined temples of Jupiter and Isis, over  the broken houses with their inmost sanctuaries open to the day, away to  Mount Vesuvius, bright and snowy in the peaceful distance; and lose all  count of time, and heed of other things, in the strange and melancholy  sensation of seeing the Destroyed and the Destroyer making this quiet  picture in the sun. Then, ramble on,"]]]
