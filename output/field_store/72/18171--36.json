[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],[0,"Christmas: A Story (#4)"],[1,"what's the use of scratching to keep up  appearances?\"    For a breath Abel Ames hesitated; then he spoke voluntarily for the  first time that evening.    \"Mr. President, I second the hull of that,\" said he, slowly, and without  looking at anybody; and then sighed his vast, triple sigh.    There was apparently nobody to vote against the motion. Mis' Winslow did  not vote at all. Ellen Bourne said \"No,\" but she said it so faintly that  nobody heard save those nearest her, and they felt a bit embarrassed for  her because she had spoken alone, and they tried to cover up the  minute.    \"Carried,\" said the Chair, and slipped out in the kitchen to put on the  coffee.    At the meeting there was almost nobody who, in the course of the  evening, did not make or reply to some form of observation on one theme.  It was:--    \"Well, I wish Mary Chavah'd been to the meeting. She'd have enjoyed  herself.\"    Or, \"Well, won't Mary Chavah be glad of this plan they've got? She's  wanted it a good while.\"    Or, \"We all seem to have come to Mary Chavah's way of thinking, don't  we? You know, she ain't kept any Christmas for years.\"    Unless it was Abel Ames. He, in fact, made or replied to almost no  observations that evening. He drank his coffee without cream, sugar, or  spoon,--they are always overlooking somebody's essentials in this way,  and such is Old Trail Town's shy courtesy that the omission is never  mentioned or repaired by the victim,--and sighed his triple sigh at  intervals, and went home.    \"Hetty,\" he said to his wife, who had not gone to the meeting, \"they put  it through. We won't have no Christmas creditors this year. We don't  have to furnish charged Christmas presents for nobody.\"    She looked up from the towel she was featherstitching--she was a little  woman who carried her head back and had large eyes and the long, curved  lashes of a child.    \"I s'pose you're real relieved, ain't you, Abel?\" she answered.    \"My, yes,\" said Abel, without expression. \"My, yes.\"           *       *       *       *       *    They all took the news home in different wise.    \"Matthew,\" said Ellen Bourne, \"the town meeting voted not to have any  Christmas this year. That is, to ask the folks not to have any--'count  of expense.\"    \"Sensible move,\" said Matthew, sharpening his ax by the kitchen stove.    \"It'll be a relief for most folks not to have the muss and the clutter,\"  said Ellen's mother.    \"Hey, king and country!\" said Ellen's old father, whittling a stick, \"I  ain't done no more'n look on at a Christmas for ten years and more--with  no children around so.\"    \"I know,\" said Ellen Bourne, \"I know....\"    The announcement was greeted by Mortimer Bates with a slap of the knee.    \"Good-by, folderol!\" he said. \"We need a sane Christmas in the world a  good sight more'n we need a sane Fourth, most places. Good work.\"    But Bennet and Gussie Bates burst into wails.    \"Hush!\" said Mis' Bates, peremptorily. \"You ain't the only ones,  remember. It's no Christmas for nobody!\"    \"I thought the rest of 'em would have one an' we could go over to  theirs....\" sobbed Gussie.    \"I'd rather p'etend it's Christmas in other houses even if we ain't it!\"  mourned Bennet.    \"Be my little man and woman,\" admonished Mis' Mortimer Bates.    At the Morans, little Emily Moran made an unexpected deduction:--    \"I _won't_ stay in bed all day Christmas!\" she gave out.    \"Stay in bed!\" echoed Mis' Moran. \"Why on this earth should you stay in  bed?\"    \"Well, if we get up, then it's Christmas and you can't stop it!\" little  Emily triumphed.    When they told Pep, the minister's son, after a long preparation by  story and other gradual approach, and a Socratic questioning cleverly  winning damning admissions from Pep, he looked up in his father's face  thoughtfully:--    \"If they ain't no Christ's birthday this year, is it a lie that Christ  was born?\" he demanded.    And secretly the children took counsel with one another: Would Buff  Miles, the church choir tenor, take them out after dark on Christmas  Eve, to sing church choir serenades at folks' gates, or would he not?  And when they thought that he might not, because this would be  considered Christmas celebration and would only make the absence of  present-giving the more conspicuous, as in the case of the Sunday  schools themselves, they faced still another theological quandary: For  if it was true that Christ was born, then Christmas was his birthday;  and if Christmas was his birthday, wasn't it wicked not to pay any  attention?    Alone of them all, little Tab Winslow rejoiced. His brothers and sisters  made the time tearful with questionings as to the effect on Santa  Claus, and how would they get word to him, and would it be Christmas in  the City, and why couldn't they move there, and other matters denoting  the reversal of this their earth. But Tab slipped out the kitchen door,  to the corner of the barn, where the great turkey gobbler who had been  named held his empire trustingly.    \"Oh, Theophilus Thistledown,\" said Tab to him, \"you're the only one in  this town that's goin' to have a Christmas. You ain't got to be et.\"          IV      The placard was tacked to the Old Trail Town post-office wall, between a  summons to join the Army and the Navy of the United States, and the  reward offered for an escaped convict--all three manifestoes registering  something of the stage of society's development.         NOTICE         Owing to the local business depression and to the current private       decisions to get up very few home Christmas celebrations this year,       and also to the vote of the various lodges, churches, Sunday       schools, etc., etc., etc., to forego the usual Christmas tree       observances, the merchants of this town have one and all united       with most of the folks to petition the rest to omit all Christmas       presents, believing that the Christmas spirit will be kept up best       by all agreeing to act alike. All that's willing may announce it by       signing below and notifying others.                                                               THE COMMITTEE.    There were only three hundred folk living in Old Trail Town. Already two  thirds of their signatures were scrawled on the sheets of foolscap  tacked beneath the notice.    On the day after her return home, Jenny Wing stood and stared at the  notice. Her mother had written to her of the town's talk, but the  placard made it seem worse.    \"I'll go in on the way home and see what Mary says,\" she thought, and  asked for the letter that lay in Mary Chavah's box, next her own. They  gave her the letter without question. All Old Trail Town asks for its  neighbour's mail and reads its neighbour's postmarks and gets to know  the different Writings and to inquire after them, like persons. (\"He  ain't got so much of a curl to his M to-day,\" one will say of a  superscription. \"Better write right back and chirk 'im up.\" Or, \"Here's  Her that don't seal her letters good. Tell her about that, why don't  you?\" Or, \"This Writing's a stranger to me. I'll just wait a minute to  see if birth or death gets out of the envelope.\")    As she closed Mary's gate and hurried up the walk, in a keen wind  flowing with little pricking flakes, Jenny was startled to see both  parlour windows open. The white muslin curtains were blowing idly as if  June were in the air. Turning as a matter of course to the path that led  to the kitchen, she was hailed by Mary, who came out the front door with  a rug in her hands.    \"Step right in this way,\" said Mary; \"this door's unfastened.\"    \"Forevermore!\" Jenny said, \"Mary Chavah! What you got your house all  open for? You ain't moving?\"    A gust of wind took Mary's answer. She tossed the rug across the icy  railing of the porch and beckoned Jenny into the house, and into the  parlour. And when she had greeted Jenny after the months of her  absence:--    \"See,\" Mary said exultantly, \"don't it look grand and empty? Look at it  first, and then come on in and I'll tell you about it.\"    The white-papered walls of the two rooms were bare of pictures; the  floor had been sparingly laid with rugs. The walnut sofa and chairs, the  table for the lamp, and the long shelves of her grandfather's  books--these were all that the room held. A white arch divided the two  chambers, like a benign brow whose face had long been dimmed away. It  was all exquisitely clean and icy cold. A little snow drifted in  through the muslin curtains. The breath of the two women showed.    \"What on earth you done that for?\" Jenny demanded.    Mary Chavah stood in the empty archway, the satisfaction on her face not  veiling its pure austerity. She was not much past thirty-three, but she  looked older, for she was gaunt. Her flesh had lost its firmness, her  dressmaking had stooped her, her strong frame moved as if it habitually  shouldered its way. In her broad forehead and deep eyes and somewhat in  her silent mouth, you read the woman--the rest of her was obscured in  her gentle reticence. She had a gray shawl, blue-bordered, folded  tightly about her head and pinned under her chin, and it wrapped her to  her feet.    \"I feel like a thing in a new shell,\" she said. \"Come on in where it's  warm.\"    Instead of moving her dining-room table to her kitchen, as most of Old  Trail Town did in Winter, Mary had moved her cooking stove into the  dining room, had improvised a calico-curtained cupboard for the  utensils, and there she lived and sewed. The windows were bare.    \"I'll let the parlour have curtains if it wants to,\" she had said, \"but  in the room I live in I want every strip of the sun I can get.\"    There were no plants, though every house in Old Trail Town had a window  of green, and slips without number were offered....    \"... You can have flowers all you want,\" she said once; \"I like 'em too  well to box 'em up in the house.\"    And there were no books.    \"I don't read,\" she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#4)"],[1,"ies, and the wireless telegraph station.    In addition to the above, our fleet has sunk in Odessa a Russian  cruiser and damaged severely another. It is believed that this second  boat was likewise sunk. Five other steamers full of cargoes lying in  the same port were seriously damaged. A steamship belonging to the  Russian volunteer fleet was also sunk, and five petroleum depots were  destroyed.    In Odessa and Sebastopol, the Russians from the shore opened fire  against our fleet.    The officers and crews of the mine-layer Pruth were subjected to a  rigid examination.    Eight or ten days ago the Pruth, lying in the roadstead of Sebastopol,  received a cargo of mines and was put under the command of officers  who for a number of years past had been training on board the Russian  depot ship in Constantinople and therefore had become familiar with  the ins and outs of the Bosphorus.    As soon as it became known that a small part of the Turkish fleet went  out to the Black Sea, the Russian fleet sailed from Sebastopol,  leaving only an adequate squadron for the protection of the city, and  on Oct. 27 put to sea, taking a southerly direction with the rest of  its forces. On the next day the mine-layer Pruth left Sebastopol and  steamed southward.    The Russian fleet, acting in different ways, intended to fill with  mines the entrance of the Bosphorus, attack the weak squadron of the  Ottoman fleet, at that time on the high seas, and cause the  destruction of the rest of the Turkish fleet, which, being left in the  Bosphorus, would rush to the assistance of the light flotilla, and,  encountering the mines, would be destroyed.    Our warships manoeuvring on the high seas met the mine-layer Pruth as  well as the torpedo boats accompanying her, and thus took place the  events already known from previous communications.    The rescued Russian officers are five in number, one of them a  Lieutenant Commander. The prisoners have been sent to Ismid.    This successful action on the part of our squadron, which only by  chance came to be on the high seas at the time of the naval battle, is  itself one of the utmost importance for us, as it assures the future  of our fleet.      THE SULTAN'S PROCLAMATION.    _As soon as war was declared against Russia, England, and consequently  France, the Sultan issued the following proclamation to his troops:_    To my army! To my navy!    Immediately after the war between the Great powers began, I called you  to arms in order to be able in case of trouble to protect the  existence of empire and country from any assault on the part of our  enemies, who are only awaiting the chance to attack us suddenly and  unexpectedly as they have always done.    While we were thus in a state of armed neutrality, a part of the  Russian fleet, which was going to lay mines at the entrance of the  straits of the Black Sea, suddenly opened fire against a squadron of  our own fleet at the time engaged in manoeuvres.    While we were expecting reparation from Russia for this unjustified  attack, contrary to international law, the empire just named, as well  as its allies, recalled their Ambassadors and severed diplomatic  relations with our country.    The fleets of England and France have bombarded the straits of the  Dardanelles, and the British fleet has shelled the harbor of Akbah on  the Red Sea. In the face of such successive proofs of wanton hostility  we have been forced to abandon the peaceful attitude for which we  always strove, and now in common with our allies, Germany and Austria,  we turn to arms in order to safeguard our lawful interests.    The Russian Empire during the last three hundred years has caused our  country to suffer many losses in territory, and when we finally arose  to that sentiment of awakening and regeneration which would increase  our national welfare and our power, the Russian Empire made every  effort to destroy our attempts, either with war or with numerous  machinations and intrigues. Russia, England, and France never for a  moment ceased harboring ill-will against our Caliphate, to which  millions of Mussulmans, suffering under the tyranny of foreign  domination, are religiously and whole-heartedly devoted, and it was  always these powers that started every misfortune that came upon us.    Therefore, in this mighty struggle which now we are undertaking, we  once for all will put an end to the attacks made from one side against  the Caliphate, and from the other against the existence of our  country.    The wounds inflicted, with the help of the Almighty, by my fleet in  the Black Sea, and by my army in the Dardanelles, in Akbah, and on the  Caucasian frontiers against our enemies, have strengthened in us the  conviction that our sacred struggle for a right cause will triumph.  The fact, moreover, that today the countries and armies of our enemies  are being crushed under the heels of our allies is a good sign, making  our conviction as regards final success still stronger.    My heroes! My soldiers! In this sacred war and struggle, which we  began against the enemies who have undermined our religion and our  holy fatherland, never for a single moment cease from strenuous effort  and from self-abnegation.    Throw yourselves against the enemy as lions, bearing in mind that the  very existence of our empire, and of 300,000,000 Moslems whom I have  summoned by sacred Fetwa to a supreme struggle, depend on your  victory.    The hearty wishes and prayers of 300,000,000 innocent and tortured  faithful, whose faces are turned in ecstasy and devotion to the Lord  of the universe in the mosques and the shrine of the Kaabah, are with  you.    My children! My soldiers! No army in the history of the world was ever  honored with a duty as sacred and as great as is yours. By fulfilling  it, show that you are the worthy descendants of the Ottoman Armies  that in the past made the world tremble, and make it impossible for  any foe of our faith and country to tread on our ground, and disturb  the peace of the sacred soil of Yemen, where the inspiring tomb of our  prophet lies. Prove beyond doubt to the enemies of the country that  there exist an Ottoman Army and Navy which know how to defend their  faith, their country and their military honor, and how to defy death  for their sovereign!    Right and loyalty are on our side, and hatred and tyranny on the side  of our enemies, and therefore there is no doubt that the Divine help  and assistance of the just God and the moral support of our glorious  Prophet will be on our side to encourage us. I feel convinced that  from this struggle we shall emerge as an empire that has made good the  losses of the past and is once more glorious and powerful.    Do not forget that you are brothers in arms of the strongest and  bravest armies of the world, with whom we now are fighting shoulder to  shoulder. Let those of you who are to die a martyr's death be  messengers of victory to those who have gone before us, and let the  victory be sacred and the sword be sharp of those of you who are to  remain in life.    MEHMED-RESHAD.    On the 22 Djilhidje, 1332.  Or October 29, 1914.      VERBATIM TERMS OF THE FETWA    (Sultan's Proclamation of a Holy War.)    _The issuance by the Sultan of the Fetwa, or proclamation, announcing  a holy war, called upon all Mussulmans capable of carrying arms--and  even upon Mussulman women--to fight against the powers with whom the  Sultan was at war. In this manner, according to Constantinople  newspapers, the holy war became a duty not only for all Ottoman  subjects, but for the 300,000,000 Moslems of the earth. The Turkish  newspaper Ikdam called upon the people as follows:_    Mussulmans, open your eyes! Grasp your weapons; trust to God. Hurl  yourselves with full might against the foe! As the Caliph has said,  the Divine help will be with us. Forward! Sons of Islam! There is no  longer a difference of nationality; there is no longer a difference of  culture. All Mussulmans are united and have but a single wish--to  destroy our foes!    _The wording of the Fetwa itself, however, is less fiery in tone than  the impassioned newspaper appeal. The Fetwa reads as follows:_    First Question--If lands of Islam are subjected to attack by enemies,  if danger threatens Islam, must in that case young and old, infantry  and mounted men, in all parts of the earth inhabited by Mohammedans,  take part in the holy war, with their fortune and their blood, in case  the Padisha declares the war to all Mohammedans? Answer--Yes.    Second Question--Since Russia, England, France, and other States  supporting these three powers against the Islamitic Caliphate have  opened hostilities against the Ottoman Empire by means of their  warships and their land troops, is it necessary that all Mohammedans  also who live in the countries named shall rise against their  Government and take part in the holy war? Answer--Yes.    Third Question--Under all circumstances, since the attainment of the  goal depends upon the participation of all Mohammedans in the holy  war, will those who refuse to join in the general uprising be punished  for conduct so abhorrent? Answer--Yes.    Fourth Question--Mohammedans who live in lands of the enemy may, under  threats against their own lives and the lives of their families, be  forced to fight against the soldiers of the States of Islam. Can such  conduct be punished as forbidden under the Sheriat, and those guilty  thereof be regarded as murderers and punished with the fires of hell?  Answer--Yes.    Fifth Question--Inasmuch as it will be detrimental to the Mohammedan  Caliphate of the Mohammedans who live in Russia, France, England,  Servia, and Montenegro fight against Germany and Austria-Hungary,  which are the saviors of the great Mohammedan Empire, will therefore  those who do so be punished with heavy penalties? Answer--Yes.      BRITAIN'S ANSWER.    [From The London Times, Nov. 6, 1914.]    _A"]]]
