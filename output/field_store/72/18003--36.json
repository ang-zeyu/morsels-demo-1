The one is freed from all her troubles; the other--Do  you think we ought to have a doctor to look after her? Shall I  telephone?\"    \"Not yet. We have much to learn before taking any decided steps.\" Then as  he caught the look of amazement with which this unexpected suggestion of  difficulties was met, he paused on his way to the stair-head to ask in a  tentative way peculiarly his own: \"Then you still think the girl died  from a thrust given by this woman?\"    \"Of course. What else is there to think? You saw where the arrow came  from. You saw that the only bow the place contained was hanging high and  unstrung upon the wall, and you are witness to this woman's irresponsible  condition of mind. The sight of those arrows well within her reach  evidently aroused the homicidal mania often latent in one of her highly  emotional nature; and when this fresh young girl came by, the natural  result followed. I only hope I shall not be called upon to face the poor  child's parents. What can I say to them? What can anybody say? Yet I do  not see how we can be held responsible for so unprecedented an attack as  this, do you?\"    Mr. Gryce made no answer. He had turned his back toward the stair-head  and was wondering if this easy explanation of a tragedy so peculiar as to  have no prototype in all of the hundreds of cases he had been called upon  to investigate in a long life of detective activity would satisfy all the  other persons then in the building. It was his present business to find  out--to search and probe among the dozen or two people he saw collected  below, for the witness who had seen or had heard some slight thing as yet  unrevealed which would throw a different light upon this matter. For his  mind--or shall we say the almost unerring instinct of this ancient delver  into human hearts?--would not accept without question this theory of  sudden madness in one of Mrs. Taylor's appearance, strange and  inexplicable as her conduct seemed. Though it was quite among the  possibilities that she had struck the fatal blow and in the manner  mentioned, it was equally clear to his mind that she had not done it in  an access of frenzy. He knew a mad eye and he knew a despairing one.  Fantastic as her story certainly was, he found himself more ready to  believe it than to accept any explanation of this crime which ascribed  its peculiar features to the irresponsibilities of lunacy.    However, he kept his impressions to himself and in his anxiety to pursue  his inquiries among the people below, was on the point of descending  thither, when he found his attention arrested, and that of the Curator's  as well, by the sight of a young man hastening toward them through the  northern gallery. (The tragedy, as you will remember, had occurred in the  southern one.) He was dressed in the uniform of the museum, and moved so  quickly and in such an evident flurry of spirits that the detective  instinctively asked:    \"Who's that? One of your own men?\"    \"Yes, that's Correy, our best-informed and most-trusted attendant. Looks  as if he had something to tell us. Well, Correy, what is it?\" he queried  as the man emerged upon the landing where they stood. \"Anything new? If  there is, speak out plainly. Mr. Gryce is anxious for all the evidence he  can get.\"    With an ingenuousness rather pleasing than otherwise to the man thus  presented to his notice, the young fellow stopped short and subjected the  famous detective to a keen and close scrutiny before venturing to give  the required information.    Was it because of the importance of what he had to communicate? It would  seem so, from the suppressed excitement of his tone, as after his brief  but exceedingly satisfactory survey, he jerked his finger over his  shoulder in the direction from which he had come, with the short remark:    \"I have something to show you.\"    Something! Mr. Gryce had been asking for this something only a moment  before. We can imagine, then, the celerity with which he followed this  new guide into the one spot of all others which possessed for him the  greatest interest. For if by any chance the arrow which had done such  deadly work had been sped from a bow instead of having been used as a  dart, then it was from this gallery and from no other quarter of the  building that it had been so sped. Any proof of this could have but the  one effect of exonerating from all blame the woman who had so impressed  him. He had traversed the first section and had entered the second, when  the Curator joined him; together they passed into the third.    For those who have not visited this museum, a more detailed description  of these galleries may be welcome. Acting as a means of communication  between the row of front rooms and those at the back, they also serve to  exhibit certain choice articles which call for little space, and are of a  nature more or less ornamental. For this purpose they are each divided  into five sections connected by arches narrower but not less decorative  than those which open in a direct row upon the court. Of these sections  the middle one on either side is much larger than the rest; otherwise  they do not differ.    It was in the midst of this larger section that Correy now stood,  awaiting their approach. There had been show-cases filled with rare  exhibits in the two through which they had just passed, but in this one  there was nothing to be seen but a gorgeous hanging, covering very nearly  the whole wall, flanked at either end by a pedestal upholding a vase of  inestimable value and corresponding ugliness. A highly decorative  arrangement, it is true, but in what lay its interest for the criminal  investigator?    Correy was soon to show them. With a significant gesture toward the  tapestry, he eagerly exclaimed:    \"You see that? I've run by it several times since the accident sent me  flying all over the building at everybody's call. But only just now, when  I had a moment to myself, did I remember the door hid behind it. It's a  door we no longer use, and I'd no reason for thinking it had anything to  do with the killing of the young lady in the opposite gallery. But for  all that I felt it would do no harm to give it a look, and running from  the front, where I happened to be, I pulled out the tapestry and saw--but  supposing I wait and let you see for yourselves. That will be better.\"    Leaving them where they stood face to face with the great hanging, he  made a dive for the pedestal towering aloft at the farther end, and  edging himself in behind it, drew out the tapestry from the wall, calling  on them as he did so to come and look behind it. The Curator did not  hesitate. He was there almost as soon as the young man himself.    But the detective was not so hasty. With a thousand things in mind, he  stopped to peer along the gallery and down into the court before giving  himself away to any prying eye. Satisfied that he might make the desired  move with impunity, Mr. Gryce was about to turn in the desired direction  when, struck by a new fact, he again stopped short.    He had noticed how the heavy tapestry shivered under Correy's clutch. Had  this been observed by anyone besides himself? If by chance some person  wandering about the court had been looking up--but no, the few people  gathered there stood too far forward to see what was going on in this  part of the gallery; and relieved from all further anxiety on this score,  he joined Correy at the pedestal and at a word from him succeeded in  squeezing himself around it into the small space they had left for him  between the pushed-out hanging and the wall. An exclamation from the  Curator, who had only waited for his coming to take his first look, added  zest to his own scrutiny. It would take something more than the sight of  a well-known door to give it such a tone of astonished discovery. What?  Even he, with the accumulated surprises of years to give wings to his  imagination, did not succeed in guessing. But when his eyes, once  accustomed to the semi-darkness of the narrow space which Correy had thus  opened out before him, saw not the door but what lay within its recess,  he acknowledged to himself that he should have guessed--and that a dozen  years before, he certainly would have done so.    It was a _bow_--not like the one hanging high in the Apache exhibit, but  yet a bow strong of make and strung for use.           *       *       *       *       *    Here was a discovery as important as it was unexpected, eliminating Mrs.  Taylor at once from the case and raising it into a mystery of the first  order. By dint of long custom, Mr. Gryce succeeded in hiding his extreme  satisfaction, but not the perplexity into which he was thrown by this  complete change of base. The Curator appeared to be impressed in much the  same way, and shook his head in a doubtful fashion when Correy asked him  if he recognized the bow as belonging to the museum.    \"I should have to see it nearer to answer that question with any sort of  confidence,\" he demurred. \"From such glimpses as I can get of it from  here I should say that it has not been taken from any of our exhibits.\"    \"I am sure it has not,\" muttered Correy. Then with a side glance at Mr.  Gryce, he added: \"Shall I slip in behind and get it?\"    The detective, thus appealed to, hesitated a moment; then with an  irrelevance perhaps natural to the occasion, he inquired where this door  so conveniently hidden from the general view led to. It was the Curator  who answered.    \"To a twisting, breakneck staircase opening directly into my office. But  this door has not been used in years. See! Here is the key to it on my  own ring. There is no other. I lost the mate to it myself not long after  my installation here.\"    The detective, working his way back around the pedestal, cast"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17766"],[0,"With Wolfe in Canada: The Winning of a Continent (#4)"],[1,"  Half an hour later there was a knock at the front door, and a few  minutes after his mother called him down. He ran down to the parlour,  and there found the showman.    \"Oh, I say,\" the boy broke out, \"don't say anything more about it! I do  hate being thanked, and there was nothing in swimming ten yards in a  calm sea. Please don't say anything more about it. I would rather you  hit me, ever so much.\"    The sergeant smiled gravely, and Mrs. Walsham exclaimed:    \"Why didn't you come in and tell me about it, Jim? I could not make out  at first what Mr.--Mr.--\"    \"Sergeant Wilks, madam.\"    \"What Sergeant Wilks meant, when he said that he had called to tell me  how grateful he felt to you for saving his little grandchild's life. I  am proud of you, Jim.\"    \"Oh, mother, don't!\" the boy exclaimed. \"It is horrid going on so. If I  had swum out with a rope through the surf, there might be something in  it; but just to jump in at the edge of the water is not worth making a  fuss about, one way or the other.\"    \"Not to you, perhaps, young gentleman, but it is to me,\" the showman  said. \"The child is the light of my life, the only thing I have to care  for in the world, and you have saved her. If it had only been by  stretching out your hand, I should have been equally grateful. However,  I will say no more about it, but I shall not think the less.    \"But don't you believe, madam, that there was no credit in it. It was  just the quickness and the promptness which saved her life. Had your  son hesitated a moment it would have been too late, for he would never  have found her. It is not likely that your son will ever have any  occasion for help of mine, but should there be an opportunity, he may  rely upon it that any service I can render him shall be his to the  death; and, unlikely as it may seem, it may yet turn out that this  brave act of his, in saving the life of the granddaughter of a  travelling showman, will not be without its reward.\"    \"Is she all right now?\" James asked abruptly, anxious to change the  conversation.    \"Yes. She soon came to herself, and wanted to tell me all about it; but  I would not let her talk, and in a few minutes she dropped off to  sleep, and there I left her. The women tell me she will probably sleep  till morning, and will then be as well as ever. And now I must go and  look after my box, or the boys will be pulling it to pieces.\"    It was, however, untouched, for in passing the sergeant had told the  little crowd that, if they left it alone, he would, on his return, let  all see without payment; and during the rest of the afternoon he was  fully occupied with successive audiences, being obliged to make his  lectures brief, in order that all might have their turn.    After the sergeant had left, James took his hat and went for a long  walk in the country, in order to escape the congratulations of the  other boys. The next day little Agnes was perfectly well, and appeared  with her grandfather in the seat, far back in the church, which he  always occupied on the Sundays he spent at Sidmouth. On these occasions  she was always neatly and prettily dressed, and, indeed, some of the  good women of the place, comparing the graceful little thing with their  own children, had not been backward in their criticisms on the folly of  the old showman, in dressing his child out in clothes fit for a lady.        Chapter 2: The Showman's Grandchild.      Three months later the showman again appeared at Sidmouth, but did not  set up his box as usual. Leaving it at his lodging, he went at once  with his grandchild to Mrs. Walsham's.    \"I have come, madam,\" he said after the first inquiries about the child  had been answered, \"on a particular business. It will seem a strange  thing to you for a man like me to ask, but things are not quite as they  seem, though I can't explain it now. But I am beating about the bush,  and not getting any nearer. I have come to ask, madam, whether you  would take charge of the child for two years. Of course I am ready to  pay anything that you may think proper.\"    \"But I don't take boarders,\" Mrs. Walsham said, much surprised at the  proposition. \"I only take girls who come in the morning and go away in  the afternoon. Besides, they are all a good many years older than your  grandchild. None of the girls who come to me are under twelve.\"    \"I know, ma'm, I know; and I am sure you must think it a great liberty  on my part to ask such a thing,\" the sergeant said apologetically. \"It  is not the teaching I want, but just a home for her.\"    Mrs. Walsham felt puzzled. She did, in her heart, feel it to be a  liberty. Surely this wandering showman would find no difficulty in  getting his grandchild taken care of among people of his own rank in  life. It did seem most singular that he should seek to place the child  with her. Mrs. Walsham was not given to thinking what her neighbours  would say, but she thought of the buzz of comment and astonishment  which her taking the charge of this child would excite. She had been  particular in keeping her little school to some extent select, and as  it was now as large as she could manage unaided, she was able to make  it almost a favour to the farmers' wives to take their girls.    But to do Mrs. Walsham justice, this thought had less influence with  her than that of the time and care which would be required by a child  of that age in the house. Certainly, she thought, as she looked at her,  sitting with her eyes wide open and an expression of grave wonder in  her face, \"she is a little darling, and as Jim saved her life I have a  special interest in her; but this is out of the question.\"    It was two or three minutes before she answered the showman's last  words.    \"No, it cannot be done, Sergeant Wilks. No money that could be paid me  would make up to me for the charge of a child of her age. I am all day  in school, and what could a child, especially one accustomed to be out  all day, do with herself? The worry and anxiety would be immense. Were  it not for my school, it would be different altogether. A child of that  age, especially such a sweet little thing as your granddaughter seems  to be, would be a pet and amusement; but as it is, I am sorry to say  that it is out of the question. But surely you will have no difficulty  in finding plenty of good women who would be glad to take her, and to  whom, having children of the same age, she would be no trouble  whatever.\"    \"Yes,\" the sergeant said slowly, \"I was afraid you would say that,  ma'm. Besides, though you are good enough not to say it, I know that  there must be other objections. I know you must be surprised at my  wanting her to be with a lady like yourself. So far as money goes, I  could afford to pay fifty pounds a year, and perhaps you might get a  girl who could look after Aggie while you are busy.\"    \"Fifty pounds a year!\" Mrs. Walsham said, greatly surprised. \"That is a  large sum, a great deal too large a sum for you to pay for the care of  such a little child. For half that, there are scores of farmers' wives  who would be happy to take her, and where she would be far more happy  and comfortable than she would be with me.\"    \"I know I could get plenty to take her,\" the soldier said, \"but I have  reasons, very particular reasons, why I wish to place her with a lady  for two years. I cannot explain those reasons to you, but you may  imagine they must be strong ones, for me to be willing to pay fifty  pounds a year for her. That money has been laid by from the day she was  born, for that purpose. I have other reasons, of my own, for wishing  that she should be at Sidmouth rather than at any other place; and I  have another reason,\" and a slight smile stole across his face, \"for  preferring that she should be with you rather than anyone else. All  this must seem very strange to you, madam; but at the end of the two  years, when you know what my reasons were, you will acknowledge that  they were good ones.    \"God knows,\" he went on, looking very grave, \"what a wrench it will be  for me to part with her. How lonely I shall be, as I tramp the country  without her pretty prattle to listen to; but I have got to do it sooner  or later, and these two years, when I can see her sometimes, will be a  break, and accustom me to do without her sweet face.    \"Please, madam,\" he urged, \"do not give me a final answer today. I  shall not go till Monday, and will call again, if you will let me, that  morning; and believe me, if I could tell you all, I could give you  reasons which would, I think, induce you to change your mind.\"    So saying, he made a military salute, took the child's hand in his, and  was soon striding along towards the sea.    Mrs. Walsham was some time before she recovered from her surprise. This  was, indeed, a mysterious affair. The earnestness with which the old  soldier pleaded his cause had moved her strongly, and had almost  persuaded her to accept the proposal, which had at first seemed  preposterous. Fifty pounds a year, too, was certainly a handsome sum.  She could get a girl from the village for two or three shillings a week  to look after the child, and go out with her during school hours, and a  hundred pounds would be a very handsome addition to the sum which she  had begun, little by little, to lay by for Jim's preparation for the  medical profession.    In the five years which would elapse, before it would be time for him  to enter upon his studies for it, she could hardly hope to lay by more  than that sum, and this would at a stroke double it. Certainly it was a  tempting offer. She could not do justice to the child, could not give  her the care and attention which she ought to have, and which she could  have for such a sum elsewhere; but the sergeant knew exactly how she  was placed, and if he was willing and anxious for her to assume the  charge of the child, why should she refuse this good offer?
