[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#4)"],[1," waking camp.  At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night  and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side,  and a great surge of fear swept through him--the fear of the wild thing  for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own  life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an  unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so  could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted  spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders  stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into  the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he  landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew  where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went  for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night  before.    A shout from Francois hailed his appearance. \"Wot I say?\" the dog-driver  cried to Perrault. \"Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing.\"    Perrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government, bearing  important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was  particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.    Three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total  of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in  harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Canon. Buck was  glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not  particularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which  animated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still  more surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They  were new dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and  unconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious  that the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by  delay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed  the supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and  the only thing in which they took delight.    Dave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then  came Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,  to the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.    Buck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he  might receive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally  apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing  their teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He  never nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he  stood in need of it. As Francois's whip backed him up, Buck found it  to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief  halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both  Dave and Solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. The  resulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the  traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he  mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. Francois's whip  snapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up  his feet and carefully examining them.    It was a hard day's run, up the Canon, through Sheep Camp, past the  Scales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of  feet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between  the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely  North. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the  craters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge  camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were  building boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made  his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all  too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his  mates to the sled.    That day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next  day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked  harder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of  the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them.  Francois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged places  with him, but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he prided himself  on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall  ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at  all.    Day after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always,  they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them  hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always  they pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling  to sleep into the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of  sun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go  nowhere. He never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.  Yet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the life,  received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition.    He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life.  A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed him of  his unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was fighting  off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the others. To  remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did hunger compel  him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him. He watched and  learned. When he saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever malingerer and  thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault's back was turned,  he duplicated the performance the following day, getting away with the  whole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he was unsuspected; while  Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught, was punished  for Buck's misdeed.    This first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland  environment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself  to changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and  terrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his  moral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for  existence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of  love and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;  but in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such  things into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he  would fail to prosper.    Not that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and  unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his  days, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. But  the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more  fundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a  moral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller's riding-whip; but  the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability  to flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his  hide. He did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his  stomach. He did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out of  respect for club and fang. In short, the things he did were done because  it was easier to do them than not to do them.    His development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard as  iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an internal  as well as external economy. He could eat anything, no matter how  loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his stomach  extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood carried it  to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the toughest and  stoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably keen, while his  hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest  sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril. He learned to bite  the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes; and when  he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole, he  would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs. His most  conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a  night in advance. No matter how breathless the air when he dug his  nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew inevitably found him to  leeward, sheltered and snug.    And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became  alive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways  he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs  ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as  they ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut  and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten  ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks  which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.  They came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been  his always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at a  star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust,  pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through  him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced  their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and the  cold, and dark.    Thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged  through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had  found a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener's  helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Priory Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield (#4)"],[1,"be providett of a churche? That is thus      answered: There is an house adjoininge, wch was the _Fratrie_,      as they termed it, a very fayre and a large house, and indeed      al-readye: if it were purged, it lacketh nothinge but the name      of a churche; is well buylded of free stone, garnished inwarde      aboute with marble pyllers, large windowes, etc. I assure you,      without partialitie, if it were roofed up, it were farre more      beautiful and conveniente than the other. Yt is provided with      goode sclate. If we mighte have the leade, we wolde compownde      with my L. Rich for convertinge the said _Fratrie_ to a      _Churche_, and wee wylle also supplye all imperfections of the      same, and not desire the p'isshe to remove tylle the other be      meete and conveniente to goe to.[13]    Lord Rich thought favourably of the proposal; but that fears were  entertained elsewhere would seem probable from a second letter, in which  Grindal writes as follows:        For S. Bartholomewes--I meane not to pulle it downe, but to      change it for a Churche more conveniente ... unlesse some      strange opinion shulde arise that prayer were more acceptable      under leade than under sclate.    The long period of neglect and desecration which follows is rather to  be inferred from the condition of the buildings in the early part of the  nineteenth century than from any actual records respecting them. What  that condition was in 1809 is described in two letters which appeared in  \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" for March and April in that year. They were  written in a spirit of indignation at the behaviour of \"a powerful  junto\" which had been formed in the parish to sweep the whole structure  away, church included, on the pretext that part of the choir was in  danger of tumbling down. It had, however, been saved by the exertions  and judicious repairs of Mr. Hardwick, to whom the writer pays a just  compliment for his timely action against the particular committee. He  then goes on with a lamentable picture of what met his eyes on a \"recent  survey\" of the Priory, which he had previously examined in 1791, when it  was pretty much in the same state.[14] The Lady Chapel was still in  existence, but wholly filled up with modern tenements; the north  transept was more or less destroyed, and the arch bricked up to reduce  that side of the church to a level, while the south transept--a ruin  without a roof--was walled off from the church, and used as a  burial-ground. The eastern side of the cloister was all that remained of  the quadrangle, and was turned to account as a \"comfortable eight-stall  stable\" for horses. The site of the north cloister was occupied by a  blacksmith's forge, a public house, and certain private offices; the  south and west being covered with store-rooms and coach-houses. Of the  Chapter House the remaining walls were \"no higher than a dado,\" and  under them the timber was stored after treatment in the sawpit of the  enclosure. The dormitory to the south of the Chapter House had been  demolished, and the crypt beneath it bricked off into divisions for  stores, with a common thoroughfare open between them. It may here be  mentioned that a close examination of the ground has shown that there  was formerly the usual \"slype,\" or open pathway, running from the  cloister-garth, between the south transept and the Chapter House, to the  canons' cemetery on the southern side of the Lady Chapel.    The building against the south wall of the choir (probably the sacristy,  though called a chapel) is described as a magnificent structure, of  about the time of Edward III, with windows on the eastern and southern  sides, and a grand arch (then latticed up) which formerly connected it  with the south transept. It was being used as a store-room for hops. The  chapel to the east of this was destroyed in its upper part, and the  windows had lost their arched heads, though the columns and architraves  to the jambs remained, showing some very delicate and beautiful work,  which was also remarkably fine in the dado mouldings. The ceiling of the  church--the wreck of the Tudor open-worked timber roof--had been \"pared  down to a common pediment covering,\" supported on the heads of cherubim  as corbels. The Doric altar-piece is contemptuously referred to as \"a  painted theatrical scene of architecture.\"[15]    While the subordinate buildings were dropping into ruin, the church,  besides having suffered from fire and neglect, had been disfigured by a  long series of repairs and embellishments, the character of which may be  inferred from the glaring instances pointed out in the letters just  quoted. The other alterations made in the interior may be briefly  summarized as follows: The level of the floor was raised by a thick  deposit of earth; the walls were enveloped in whitewash, to the  concealment of the ancient mural paintings and certain delicate  sculptured ornament; and high pews were erected, which reached almost to  the capitals of the piers. The openings of the triforium were bricked  up--in some cases entirely obliterated--and at the east end, above the  altar-piece just mentioned, there rose a brick wall, pierced with two  ugly round-headed windows, filled with square panes of glass, and  destitute of mullions and tracery. The space between the termination  thus formed and the original apse went by the name of \"Purgatory,\" as a  receptacle for human bones, some thousands of which were found to have  accumulated when it was cleared out in 1836.[16]    [Illustration: THE CHOIR BEFORE RESTORATION, SHOWING THE FACTORY FLOOR                 EXTENDING OVER THE APSE AND SUPPORTED BY TWO IRON COLUMNS]    The secularization of this extreme eastern part of the church is traced  to the first purchaser from the Government, who held that the sanctuary  was bounded by the straight wall which there ran across it. A more  modern consequence than that just mentioned was the intrusion into the  triforium of a Nonconformist school, which was held there during the  eighteenth century, in connection with a chapel belonging to the  particular denomination immediately outside, having a convenient access  to the triforium from its own galleries. Another encroachment was a  fringe manufactory, which extended westwards along the triforium so as  to include Prior Bolton's window, and held its ground for some time  after the main arcading of the apse had been restored. Visitors to the  church before the restoration was complete will remember a substantial  iron bar which was carried across the curve, above the altar, to  strengthen the walls--an eyesore which could not be removed till the  intruding factory was bought out (_vide infra_).    The real work of restoration was begun in 1863 by the late Rev. John  Abbiss, then Rector of the parish, who raised something like L5,000, and  spent it in reducing the floor to its original level, removing the pews  (which had previously been lowered), repairing the walls and piers, and  rebuilding the central part of the apse, which had been pulled down  early in the fifteenth century, as already explained.    Outside the church a dry area was formed for the better protection of  the fabric against the subsidence known to follow on the ignorance, or  indifference, of early builders as to underlying strata. All this was  accomplished in three years, when the money was exhausted, and a fresh  fund had to be created for the continuation of the restorative work. In  raising subscriptions the then patron of the living, the Rev. F. P.  Phillips, was well supported by the parishioners, the City Companies,  the Charity Commissioners (out of the City Ecclesiastical Funds), and  the general public, with the result that a sum of over L28,000 was got  together. The chief individual contributor was the patron himself, who  purchased the projecting fringe factory for L6,500,[17] and completed  the restoration of the apse at his own expense. At the same time the  church was provided with a new roof, and the blacksmith's forge, which  occupied the site of the north transept, was bought out. On the 30th  November, 1886, the restored portions were formally opened, the actual  work having started about two years before, under the active interest of  the Rev. William Panckridge, who succeeded Mr. Abbiss in the Rectory.    The long list of works undertaken and completed from 1887 to 1893, under  the succeeding Rector, the Rev. Sir J. Borradaile Savory, Bart.,  includes the restoration of both transepts, the opening out of both  sides of the choir triforium,[18] the erection of the north and west  porches, the refacing of the west front, the reparation of the brick  tower, and the re-hanging of the bells, besides numerous external and  internal details.    The crowning work was the reconstruction of the Lady Chapel, which was  not completed till 1896, after the tedious business of releasing it from  its secular holders, and the recovery of the original design amidst the  mutilation in which they left it. The whole has been admirably carried  through by Sir Aston Webb, R.A., who has restored the precious fabric as  nearly as possible to its original state, by replacing what was  destroyed, and revealing what was concealed when the difficult task was  committed to him.    The restoration has since been extended to three bays on the eastern  side of the cloister, all that remained of the original quadrangle, and  these in a sadly ruinous state. Whether the cloisters were completed by  Rahere is a matter of conjecture; but it may be fairly assumed that they  were begun by him as a necessary part of the monastery. The surviving  Norman fragments point to the twelfth century as the date of their first  erection. It is certain that they were rebuilt in the fifteenth, for  besides the architectural remains of that period, there is historical  evidence that the work was done under Prior John Watford soon after"]]]
