In Fig. 291 we have the result exhibited in  a plain open or reticulated fabric constructed from ordinary untwisted  fillets, such as are employed in our splint and cane products. Fig.  292 illustrates the surface produced by crowding the horizontal series  of the same fabric close together, so that the vertical series is  entirely hidden. The surface here exhibits a succession of vertical  ribs, an effect totally distinct from that seen in the preceding  example. The third variety (Fig. 293) differs but slightly from the  first. The fillets are wider and are set close together without  crowding, giving the surface a checkered appearance.    [Illustration: FIG. 291. Surface relief in simplest form of  intersection.]    [Illustration: FIG. 292. Surface relief produced by horizontal series  crowded together.]    [Illustration: FIG. 293. Surface relief produced by wide fillets set  close together.]    The second variety of surface effect is that most frequently seen in  the basketry of our western tribes, as it results from the great  degree of compactness necessary in vessels intended to contain  liquids, semiliquid foods, or pulverized substances. The general  surface effect given by closely woven work is illustrated in Fig. 294,  which represents a large wicker carrying basket obtained from the Moki  Indians. In this instance the ridges, due to a heavy series of  radiating warp filaments, are seen in a vertical position.    [Illustration: FIG. 294. Basket showing ribbed surface produced by  impacting the horizontal or concentric filaments. Moki work--1/8.]    [Illustration: FIG. 295. Alternation of intersection, producing  oblique or spiral ribs. Piute work--1/8.]    [Illustration: FIG. 296. Radiating ribs as seen in flat work viewed  from above. Moki work--1/4.]    It will be observed, however, that the ridges do not necessarily take  the direction of the warp filaments, for, with a different alternation  of the horizontal series--the woof--we get oblique ridges, as shown in  the partly finished bottle illustrated in Fig. 295. They are,  however, not so pronounced as in the preceding case. The peculiar  effect of radiate and concentric weaving upon the ribs is well shown  in Fig. 296.    By changes in the order of intersection, without changing the type of  combination, we reach a series of results quite unlike the preceding;  so distinct, indeed, that, abstracted from constructive relationships,  there would be little suggestion of correlation. In the example given  in Fig. 297 the series of filaments interlace, not by passing over and  under alternate strands, as in the preceding set of examples, but by  extending over and under a number of the opposing series at each step  and in such order as to give wide horizontal ridges ribbed diagonally.    [Illustration: FIG. 297. Diagonal combination, giving herring bone  effect.]    [Illustration: FIG. 298. Elaboration of diagonal combination, giving  triangular figures.]    This example is from an ancient work basket obtained at Ancon, Peru,  and shown in Fig. 299. The surface features are in strong relief,  giving a pronounced herring bone effect.    [Illustration: FIG. 299. Peruvian work basket of reeds, with strongly  relieved ridges.]    Slight changes in the succession of parts enable the workman to  produce a great variety of decorative patterns, an example of which is  shown in Fig. 298. A good illustration is also seen in Fig. 286, and  another piece, said to be of Seminole workmanship, is given in Fig.  300. These and similar relieved results are fruitful sources of  primitive decorative motives. They are employed not only within the  art itself, but in many other arts less liberally supplied with  suggestions of embellishment.    [Illustration: FIG. 300. Effects produced by varying the order of  intersection. Seminole work--1/8.]    Taking a second type of combination, we have a family of resultant  patterns in the main distinguishable from the preceding.    [Illustration: FIG. 301. Surface effect in open twined combination.]    [Illustration: FIG. 302. Surface effect of twined, lattice combination  in basketry of the Clallam Indians of Washington Territory--1/8.]    Fig. 301 illustrates the simplest form of what Dr. O.T. Mason has  called the twined combination, a favorite one with many of our native  tribes. The strands of the woof series are arranged in twos and in  weaving are twisted half around at each intersection, inclosing the  opposing fillets. The resulting open work has much the appearance of  ordinary netting, and when of pliable materials and distended or  strained over an earthen or gourd vessel the pattern exhibited is  strikingly suggestive of decoration. The result of this combination  upon a lattice foundation of rigid materials is well shown in the  large basket presented in Fig. 302. Other variants of this type are  given in the three succeeding figures.    [Illustration: FIG. 303. Surface effect in impacted work of twined  combination.]    The result seen in Fig. 303 is obtained by impacting the horizontal or  twined series of threads. The surface is nearly identical with that of  the closely impacted example of the preceding type (Fig. 292). The  peculiarities are more marked when colors are used. When the doubled  and twisted series of strands are placed far apart and the opposing  series are laid side by side a pleasing result is given, as shown in  Fig. 304 and in the body of the conical basket illustrated in Fig.  307.    [Illustration: FIG. 304. Surface effect obtained by placing the warp  strands close together and the woof cables far apart.]    [Illustration: FIG. 305. Surface effect obtained by crossing the warp  series in open twined work.]    In Fig. 305 we have a peculiar diagonally crossed arrangement of the  untwisted series of filaments, giving a lattice work effect.    [Illustration: FIG. 306. Decorative effects produced by variations in  the radiate or warp series in an open work tray. Klamath work--1/4.]    Fig. 306 serves to show how readily this style of weaving lends  itself to the production of decorative modification, especially in the  direction of the concentric zonal arrangement so universal in  vessel-making arts.    The examples given serve to indicate the unlimited decorative  resources possessed by the art without employing any but legitimate  constructive elements, and it will be seen that still wider results  can be obtained by combining two or more varieties or styles of  binding in the construction and the embellishment of a single object  or in the same piece of fabric. A good, though very simple,  illustration of this is shown in the tray or mat presented in Fig.  286. In this case a border, varying from the center portion in  appearance, is obtained by changing one series of the filaments from a  multiple to a single arrangement.    [Illustration: FIG. 307. Conical basket of the Klamath Indians of  Oregon, showing peculiar twined effect and an open work border--1/8.]    The conical basket shown in Fig. 307 serves to illustrate the same  point. In this case a rudely worked, though effective, border is  secured by changing the angle of the upright series near the top and  combining them by plaiting, and in such a way as to leave a border of  open work.    Now the two types of construction, the interlaced and the twined, some  primitive phases of which have been reviewed and illustrated, as they  are carried forward in the technical progress of the art, exhibit many  new features of combination and resultant surface character, but the  elaboration is in all cases along lines peculiar to these types of  weaving.    Other types of combination of web and woof, all tapestry, and all  braiding, netting, knitting, crochet, and needle work exhibit  characters peculiar to themselves, developing distinct groups of  relieved results; yet all are analogous in principle to those already  illustrated and unite in carrying forward the same great geometric  system of combination.    _Reticulated work._--A few paragraphs may be added here in regard to  reticulated fabrics of all classes of combination, as they exhibit  more than usually interesting relievo phenomena and have a decided  bearing upon the growth of ornament.    In all the primitive weaving with which we are acquainted definite  reticulated patterns are produced by variations in the spacings and  other relations of the warp and woof; and the same is true in all the  higher forms of the art. The production of reticulated work is the  especial function of netting, knitting, crocheting, and certain  varieties of needlework, and a great diversity of relieved results are  produced, no figure being too complex and no form too pronounced to be  undertaken by ambitious workmen.    In the following figures we have illustrations of the peculiar class  of primitive experiments that, after the lapse of ages, lead up to  marvelous results, the highest of which may be found in the exquisite  laces of cultured peoples. The Americans had only taken the first  steps in this peculiar art, but the results are on this account of  especial interest in the history of the art.    An example of simple reticulated hand weaving is shown in Fig. 308. It  is the work of the mound builders and is taken from an impression upon  an ancient piece of pottery obtained in Tennessee.    [Illustration: FIG. 308. Incipient stage of reticulated ornament.  Fabric of the mound builders.]    Fig. 309 illustrates a bit of ancient Peruvian work executed on a  frame or in a rude loom, a checker pattern being produced by arranging  the warp and woof now close together and now wide apart.    Open work of this class is sometimes completed by after processes,  certain threads or filaments being drawn out or introduced, by which  means the figures are emphasized and varied.    In Fig. 310 we have a second Peruvian example in which the woof  threads have been omitted for the space of an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17740"],[0,"The Chemistry of Hat Manufacturing (#4)"],[1,"  to 50 per cent. of water: Wool, fur, or hair that has been washed,  absorbs the most moisture; indeed, the amount of water taken up varies  inversely with the fatty or oily matter present. Hence the less fat the  more moisture. In the washed wool, those fibres in which the cells are  more loosely arranged have the greatest absorbing power for water. No  doubt the moisture finds its way in between the cells of the wool fibre  from which the oil or fat has been removed. But I need hardly remind you  that if wool and fur are capable, according to the circumstances under  which they are placed, of absorbing so much moisture as that indicated,  it becomes (especially in times of pressure and competition) very  important to inquire if it be not worth while to cease paying wool and  fur prices for mere water. This question was answered long ago in the  negative by our Continental neighbours, and in Germany, France, and  Switzerland official conditioning establishments have been founded by  the Governments of those countries for the purpose of testing lots of  purchased wool and silk, etc., for moisture, in order that this moisture  may be deducted from the invoices, and cash paid for real dry wool, etc.  I would point out that if you, as hat manufacturers, desire to enter the  lists with Germany, you must not let her have any advantage you have  not, and it is an advantage to pay for what you know exactly the  composition of, rather than for an article that may contain 7 per cent.  or, for aught you know, 17 per cent. or 30 per cent. of water. There is,  so far as I know, no testing for water in wools and furs in this  country, and certainly no \"conditioning establishments\" (1887), and, I  suppose, if a German or French wool merchant or furrier could be  imagined as selling wool, etc., in part to a German or French firm, and  in part to an English one, the latter would take the material without a  murmur, though it might contain 10 per cent., or, peradventure, 30 per  cent. of water, and no doubt the foreign, just as the English merchant  or dealer, would get the best price he could, and regard the possible 10  per cent. or 30 per cent. of water present with certainly the more  equanimity the more of that very cheap element there were present. But  look at the other side. The German or French firm samples its lot as  delivered, takes the sample to be tested, and that 10 or 30 per cent. of  water is deducted, and only the dry wool is paid for. A few little  mistakes of this kind, I need hardly say, will altogether form a kind of  _vade mecum_ for the foreign competitor.    We will now see what the effect of water is in the felting operation.  Especially hot water assists that operation, and the effect is a  curious one. When acid is added as well, the felting is still further  increased, and shrinking also takes place. As already shown you, the  free ends of the scales, themselves softened by the warm dilute acid,  are extended and project more, and stand out from the shafts of the  hairs. On the whole, were I a hat manufacturer, I should prefer to buy  my fur untreated by that nitric acid and mercury process previously  referred to, and promote its felting properties myself by the less  severe and more rational course of proceeding, such, for example, as  treatment with warm dilute acid. We have referred to two enemies  standing in the way to the obtainment of a final lustre and finish on  felted wool or fur, now let us expose a third. In the black dyeing of  the hat-forms a boiling process is used. Let us hear what Dr. Bowman, in  his work on the wool fibre, says with regard to boiling with water.  \"Wool which looked quite bright when well washed with tepid water, was  decidedly duller when kept for some time in water at a temperature of  160 deg. F., and the same wool, when subjected to boiling water at 212 deg. F.,  became quite dull and lustreless. When tested for strength, the same  fibres which carried on the average 500 grains without breaking before  boiling, after boiling would not bear more than 480 grains.\" Hence this  third enemy is a boiling process, especially a long-continued one if  only with water itself. If we could use coal-tar colours and dye in only  a warm weak acid bath, not boil, we could get better lustre and finish.    We will now turn our attention to the chemical composition of wool and  fur fibres. On chemical analysis still another element is found over and  above those mentioned as the constituents of silk fibre. In silk, you  will recollect, we observed the presence of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,  and nitrogen. In wool, fur, etc., we must add a fifth constituent,  namely, sulphur. Here is an analysis of pure German wool--Carbon, 49.25  per cent.; hydrogen, 7.57; oxygen, 23.66; nitrogen, 15.86; sulphur,  3.66--total, 100.00. If you heat either wool, fur, or hair to 130 deg. C.,  it begins to decompose, and to give off ammonia; if still further heated  to from 140 deg. to 150 deg. C., vapours containing sulphur are evolved. If some  wool be placed in a dry glass tube, and heated strongly so as to cause  destructive distillation, products containing much carbonate of ammonium  are given off. The ammonia is easily detected by its smell of hartshorn  and the blue colour produced on a piece of reddened litmus paper, the  latter being a general test to distinguish alkalis, like ammonia, soda,  and potash, from acids. No vegetable fibres will, under any  circumstances, give off ammonia. It may be asked, \"But what does the  production of ammonia prove?\" I reply, the \"backbone,\" chemically  speaking, of ammonia is nitrogen. Ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and  hydrogen, and is formulated NH_{3}, and hence to discover ammonia in the  products as mentioned is to prove the prior existence of its nitrogen in  the wool, fur, and hair fibres.    _Action of Acids on Wool, etc._--Dilute solutions of vitriol (sulphuric  acid) or hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid, spirits of salt) have little  effect on wool, whether warm or cold, except to open out the scales and  confer roughness on the fibre. Used in the concentrated state, however,  the wool or fur would soon be disintegrated and ruined. But under all  circumstances the action is far less than on cotton, which is destroyed  at once and completely. Nitric acid acts like sulphuric and hydrochloric  acids, but it gives a yellow colour to the fibre. You see this clearly  enough in the fur that comes from your furriers after the treatment they  subject it to with nitric acid and nitrate of mercury. There is a  process known called the stripping of wool, and it consists in  destroying the colour of wool and woollen goods already dyed, in order  that they may be re-dyed. Listen, however, to the important precautions  followed: A nitric acid not stronger than from 3 deg. to 4 deg. Twaddell is  used, and care is taken not to prolong the action more than three or  four minutes.    _Action of Alkalis._--Alkalis have a very considerable action on fur and  wool, but the effects vary a good deal according to the kind of alkali  used, the strength and the temperature of the solution, as also, of  course, the length of period of contact. The caustic alkalis, potash and  soda, under all conditions affect wool and fur injuriously. In fact, we  have a method of recovering indigo from indigo-dyed woollen rags, based  on the solubility of the wool in hot caustic soda. The wool dissolves,  and the indigo, being insoluble, remains, and can be recovered. Alkaline  carbonates and soap in solution have little or no injurious action if  not too strong, and if the temperature be not over 50 deg. C. (106 deg. F.).  Soap and carbonate of ammonium have the least injurious action. Every  washer or scourer of wool, when he uses soaps, should first ascertain if  they are free from excess of alkali, _i.e._ that they contain no free  alkali; and when he uses soda ash (sodium carbonate), that it contains  no caustic alkali. Lime, in water or otherwise, acts injuriously,  rendering the fibre brittle.    _Reactions and tests proving chemical differences and illustrating modes  of discriminating and separating vegetable fibres, silk and wool, fur,  etc._--You will remember I stated that the vegetable fibre differs  chemically from those of silk, and silk from wool, fur, and hair, in  that with the first we have as constituents only carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen; in silk we have carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen; whilst  in wool, fur, and hair we have carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and  sulphur. I have already shown you that if we can liberate by any means  ammonia from a substance, we have practically proved the presence of  nitrogen in that substance, for ammonia is a nitrogen compound. As  regards sulphur and its compounds, that ill-smelling gas, sulphuretted  hydrogen, which occurs in rotten eggs, in organic effluvia from  cesspools and the like, and which in the case of bad eggs, and to some  extent with good eggs, turns the silver spoons black, and in the case of  white lead paints turns these brown or black, I can show you some still  more convincing proofs that sulphur is contained in wool, fur, and hair,  and not in silk nor in vegetable fibres. First, I will heat strongly  some cotton with a little soda-lime in a tube, and hold a piece of  moistened red litmus paper over the mouth of the tube. If nitrogen is  present it will take up hydrogen in the decomposition ensuing, and  escape as ammonia, which will turn the red litmus paper blue. With the  cotton, however, no ammonia escapes, no turning of the piece of red  litmus paper blue is observed, and so no nitrogen can be present in the  cotton fibre. Secondly, I will similarly treat some silk. Ammonia  escapes, turns the red litmus paper blue, possesses the smell like  hartshorn, and produces, with hydrochloric acid on the stopper of a  bottle, dense white fumes of sal-ammoniac (ammonium chloride). Hence  silk contains"]]]
