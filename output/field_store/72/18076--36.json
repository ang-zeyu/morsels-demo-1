[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#4)"],[1,"ndscape, and  Lorraine was glad that her journey would take her close to them.    \"Thank you so much,\" she said coldly and returned to the station. In the  small lavatory of the depot waiting room she exchanged her slippers for  a pair of moderately low-heeled shoes which she had at the last minute  of packing tucked into her suitcase, put a few extra articles into her  rather smart traveling bag, left the suitcase in the telegraph office  and started. Not another question would she ask of Echo, Idaho, which  was flatter and more insipid than the drinking water in the tin \"cooler\"  in the waiting room. The station agent stood with his hands on his hips  and watched her cross the track and start down the road, pardonably  astonished to see a young woman walk down a road that led only to the  hills twenty miles away, carrying her luggage exactly as if her trip was  a matter of a block or two at most.    The bag was rather heavy and as she went on it became heavier. She meant  to carry it slung across her shoulder on a stick as soon as she was well  away from the prying eyes of Echo's inhabitants. Later, if she felt  tired, she could easily hide it behind a bush along the road and send  one of her father's cowboys after it. The road was very dusty and  carried the wind-blown traces of automobile tires. Some one would surely  overtake her and give her a ride before she walked very far.    For the first half hour she believed that she was walking on level  ground, but when she looked back there was no sign of any town behind  her. Echo had disappeared as completely as if it had been swallowed.  Even the unseemly bay-windowed houses on the hill had gone under. She  walked for another half hour and saw only the gray sage stretching all  around her. The hills looked farther away than when she started. Still,  that beaten road must lead somewhere. Two hours later she began to  wonder why this particular road should be so unending and so empty.  Never in her life before had she walked for two hours without seeming to  get anywhere, or without seeing any living human.    Both shoulders were sore from the weight of the bag on the stick, but  the sagebushes looked so exactly alike that she feared she could not  describe the particular spot where the cowboys would find her bag,  wherefore she carried it still. She was beginning to change hands very  often when the wind came.    Just where or how that wind sprang up she did not know. Suddenly it was  whooping across the sage and flinging up clouds of dust from the road.  To Lorraine, softened by years of southern California weather, it seemed  to blow straight off an ice field, it was so cold.    After an interminable time which measured three hours on her watch, she  came to an abrupt descent into a creek bed, down the middle of which the  creek itself was flowing swiftly. Here the road forked, a rough,  little-used trail keeping on up the creek, the better traveled road  crossing and climbing the farther bank. Lorraine scarcely hesitated  before she chose the main trail which crossed the creek.    From the creek the trail she followed kept climbing until Lorraine  wondered if there would ever be a top. The wind whipped her narrow  skirts and impeded her, tugged at her hat, tingled her nose and watered  her eyes. But she kept on doggedly, disgustedly, the West, which she had  seen through the glamour of swift-blooded Romance, sinking lower and  lower in her estimation. Nothing but jack rabbits and little, twittery  birds moved through the sage, though she watched hungrily for horsemen.    Quite suddenly the gray landscape glowed with a palpitating radiance,  unreal, beautiful beyond expression. She stopped, turned to face the  west and stared awestruck at one of those flaming sunsets which makes  the desert land seem but a gateway into the ineffable glory beyond the  earth. That the high-piled, gorgeous cloud-bank presaged a thunderstorm  she never guessed; and that a thunderstorm may be a deadly, terrifying  peril she never had quite believed. Her mother had told of people being  struck by lightning, but Lorraine could not associate lightning with  death, especially in the West, where men usually died by shooting,  lynching, or by pitching over a cliff.    The wind hushed as suddenly as it had whooped. Warned by the twinkling  lights far behind her--lights which must be the small part at last  visible of Echo, Idaho--Lorraine went on. She had been walking steadily  for four hours, and she must surely have come nearly twenty miles. If  she ever reached the top of the hill, she believed that she would see  her father's ranch just beyond.    The afterglow had deepened to dusk when she came at last to the highest  point of that long grade. Far ahead loomed a cluster of square, black  objects which must be the ranch buildings of the Quirt, and Lorraine's  spirits lightened a little. What a surprise her father and all his  cowboys would have when she walked in upon them! It was almost worth the  walk, she told herself hearteningly. She hoped that dad had a good cook.  He would wear a flour-sack apron, naturally, and would be tall and lean,  or else very fat. He would be a comedy character, but she hoped he would  not be the grouchy kind, which, though very funny when he rampages  around on the screen, might be rather uncomfortable to meet when one is  tired and hungry and out of sorts. But of course the crankiest of comedy  cooks would be decently civil to _her_. Men always were, except  directors who are paid for their incivility.    A hollow into which she walked in complete darkness and in silence, save  the gurgling of another stream, hid from sight the shadowy semblance of  houses and barns and sheds. Their disappearance slumped her spirits  again, for without them she was no more than a solitary speck in the  vast loneliness. Their actual nearness could not comfort her. She was  seized with a reasonless, panicky fear that by the time she crossed the  stream and climbed the hill beyond they would no longer be there where  she had seen them. She was lifting her skirts to wade the creek when the  click of hoofs striking against rocks sent her scurrying to cover in a  senseless fear.    \"I learned this act from the jack rabbits,\" she rallied herself shakily,  when she was safely hidden behind a sagebush whose pungency made her  horribly afraid that she might sneeze, which would be too ridiculous.    \"Some of dad's cowboys, probably, but still they _may_ be bandits.\"    If they were bandits they could scarcely be out banditting, for the two  horsemen were talking in ordinary, conversational tones as they rode  leisurely down to the ford. When they passed Lorraine, the horse nearest  her shied against the other and was sworn at parenthetically for a fool.  Against the skyline Lorraine saw the rider's form bulk squatty and  ungraceful, reminding her of an actor whom she knew and did not like. It  was that resemblance perhaps which held her quiet instead of following  her first impulse to speak to them and ask them to carry her grip to the  house.    The horses stopped with their forefeet in the water and drooped heads to  drink thirstily. The riders continued their conversation.    \"--and as I says time and again, they ain't big enough to fight the  outfit, and the quicker they git out the less lead they'll carry under  their hides when they do go. What they want to try an' hang on for,  beats me. Why, it's like setting into a poker game with a five-cent  piece! They ain't got my sympathy. I ain't got any use for a damn fool,  no way yuh look at it.\"    \"Well, there's the TJ--they been here a long while, and they ain't  packin' any lead, and they ain't getting out.\"    \"Well, say, lemme tell yuh something. The TJ'll git theirs and git it  right. Drink all night, would yuh?\" He swore long and fluently at his  horse, spurred him through the shallows, and the two rode on up the  hill, their voices still mingled in desultory argument, with now and  then an oath rising clearly above the jumble of words.    They may have been law-abiding citizens riding home to families that  were waiting supper for them, but Lorraine crept out from behind her  sagebush, sneezing and thanking her imitation of the jack rabbits.  Whoever they were, she was not sorry she had let them ride on. They  might be her father's men, and they might have been very polite and  chivalrous to her. But their voices and their manner of speaking had  been rough; and it is one thing, Lorraine reflected, to mingle with  made-up villains--even to be waylaid and kidnapped and tied to trees and  threatened with death--but it is quite different to accost  rough-speaking men in the dark when you know that they are not being  rough to suit the director of the scene.    She was so absorbed in trying to construct a range war or something  equally thrilling from the scrap of conversation she had heard that she  reached the hilltop in what seemed a very few minutes of climbing. The  sky was becoming overcast. Already the stars to the west were blotted  out, and the absolute stillness of the atmosphere frightened her more  than the big, dark wilderness itself. It seemed to her exactly as though  the earth was holding its breath and waiting for something terrible to  happen. The vague bulk of buildings was still some distance ahead, and  when a rumble like the deepest notes of a pipe organ began to fill all  the air, Lorraine thrust her grip under a bush and began to run, her  soggy shoes squashing unpleasantly on the rough places in the road.    Lorraine had seen many stage storms and had thrilled ecstatically to the  mimic lightning, knowing just how it was made. But when that huge  blackness behind and to the left of her began to open and show a  terrible brilliance within, and to close abruptly, leaving the world ink  black, she was terrified. She wanted to hide as she had hidden from  those two men; but from that stupendous"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19172"],[0,"An Australian in China (#4)"],[1,"of my boys jumped ashore and laid hold of it; another with his  bamboo boat-hook stood on the bow; the laoban was at the tiller; and I  was cooped up useless in the well under the awning. The men started  hauling as we pushed out into the sea of waters. The boat quivered, the  water leapt at the bow as if it would engulf us; our three men were  obviously too few. The boat danced in the rapid. My men on board  shrieked excitedly that the towrope was fouling--it had caught in a  rock--but their voices could not be heard; our trackers were brought to  with a jerk; the hindmost saw the foul and ran back to free it, but he  was too late, for the boat had come beam on to the current. Our captain  frantically waved to let go, and the next moment we were tossed bodily  into the cataract. The boat heeled gunwale under, and suddenly, but the  bowman kept his feet like a Blondin, dropped the boat-hook, and jumped  to unlash the halyard; a wave buried the boat nose under and swamped me  in my kennel; my heart stopped beating, and, scared out of my wits, I  began to strip off my sodden clothes; but before I had half done the  sail had been set; both men had miraculously fended the boat from a  rock, which, by a moment's hesitation, would have smashed us in bits or  buried us in the boiling trough formed by the eddy below it, and, with  another desperate effort, we had slid from danger into smooth water.  Then my men laughed heartily. How it was done I do not know, but I felt  keen admiration for the calm dexterity with which it had been done.    We baled the water out of the boat, paid out a second towrope--this one  from the bow to keep the stern under control, the other being made fast  to the mast, and took on board a licensed pilot. Extra trackers, hired  for a few cash, laid hold of both towlines, and bodily--the water  swelling and foaming under our bows--the boat was hauled against the  torrent, and up the ledge of water that stretches across the river. We  were now in smooth water at the entrance to the Mi Tsang Gorge. Two  stupendous walls of rock, almost perpendicular, as bold and rugged as  the Mediterranean side of the Rock of Gibraltar seem folded one behind  the other across the river. \"Savage cliffs are these, where not a tree  and scarcely a blade of grass can grow, and where the stream, which is  rather heard than seen, seems to be fretting in vain efforts to escape  from its dark and gloomy prison.\" In the gorge itself the current was  restrained, and boats could cross from bank to bank without difficulty.  It was an eerie feeling to glide over the sunless water shut in by the  stupendous sidewalls of rock. At a sandy spit to the west of the gorge  we landed and put things in order. And here I stood and watched the  junks disappear down the river one after the other, and I saw the truth  of what Hosie had written that, as their masts are always unshipped in  the down passage, the junks seem to be \"passing with their human freight  into eternity.\"    An immensely high declivity with a precipitous face was in front of us,  which strained your eyes to look at; yet high up to the summit and to  the very edge of the precipice, little farmsteads are dotted, and every  yard of land available is under cultivation. So steep is it that the  scanty soil must be washed away, you think, at the first rains, and only  an adventurous goat could dwell there in comfort. My laoban, Enjeh,  pointing to this mighty mass, said, \"_Pin su chiao_;\" but whether these  words were the name of the place, or were intended to convey to me his  sense of its magnificence, or dealt with the question of the  precariousness of tenure so far above our heads, I had no means to  determine.    My laoban knew twelve words of English, and I twelve words of Chinese,  and this was the extent of our common vocabulary; it had to be carefully  eked out with signs and gestures. I knew the Chinese for rice,  flourcake, tea, egg, chopsticks, opium, bed, by-and-by, how many,  charcoal, cabbage, and customs. My laoban could say in English, or  pidgin English, chow, number one, no good, go ashore, sit down,  by-and-by, to-morrow, match, lamp, alright, one piecee, and goddam. This  last named exotic he had been led to consider as synonymous with \"very  good.\" It was not the first time I had known the words to be misapplied.  I remember reading in the _Sydney Bulletin_, that a Chinese cook in  Sydney when applying for a situation detailed to the mistress his  undeniable qualifications, concluding with the memorable announcement,  \"My Clistian man mum; my eat beef; my say goddam.\"    There was a small village behind us. The villagers strolled down to see  the foreigner whom children well in the background called \"_Yang  kweitze_\" (foreign devil). Below on the sand, were the remains of a  junk, confiscated for smuggling salt; it had been sawn bodily in two.  Salt is a Government monopoly and a junk found smuggling it is  confiscated on the spot.    Kueichow, on the left bank, is the first walled town we came to. Here  we had infinite difficulty in passing the rapids, and crossed and  recrossed the river several times. I sat in the boat stripped and  shivering, for shipwreck seemed certain, and I did not wish to be  drowned like a rat. For cool daring I never saw the equal of my boys,  and their nicety of judgment was remarkable. Creeping along close to the  bank, every moment in danger of having its bottom knocked out, the boat  would be worked to the exact point from which the crossing of the river  was feasible, balanced for a moment in the stream, then with sail set  and a clipping breeze, and my men working like demons with the oars,  taking short strokes, and stamping time with their feet, the boat shot  into the current. We made for a rock in the centre of the river; we  missed it, and my heart was in my mouth as I saw the rapid below us into  which we were being drawn, when the boat mysteriously swung half round  and glided under the lee of the rock. One of the boys leapt out with the  bow-rope, and the others with scull and boat-hook worked the boat round  to the upper edge of the rock, and then, steadying her for the dash  across, pushed off again into the swirling current and made like fiends  for the bank. Standing on the stern, managing the sheet and tiller, and  with his bamboo pole ready, the laoban yelled and stamped in his  excitement; there was the roar of the cataract below us, towards which  we were fast edging stern on, destruction again threatened us and all  seemed over, when in that moment we entered the back-wash and were again  in good shelter. And so it went on, my men with splendid skill doing  always the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, with  unerring certainty.    At Yehtan rapid, which is said to be the worst on the river in the  winter, as the Hsintan rapid is in summer, three of the boys went  ashore to haul us up the ledge of water--they were plainly insufficient.  While we were hanging on the cataract extra trackers appeared from  behind the rocks and offered their services. They could bargain with us  at an advantage. It was a case well known to all Chinese \"of speaking of  the price after the pig has been killed.\" But, when we agreed to their  terms, they laid hold of the towrope and hauled us through in a moment.  Here, as at other dangerous rapids on the river, an official lifeboat is  stationed. It is of broad beam, painted red. The sailors are paid eighty  cash (_2d._) a day, and are rewarded with 1000 cash for every life they  save, and 800 cash for every corpse.    Wushan Gorge, the \"Witches' Gorge,\" which extends from Kuantukou to  Wushan-hsien, a distance of twenty miles, is the longest gorge on the  river.    Directly facing us as we emerged from the gorge was the walled town of  Wushan-hsien. Its guardian pagoda, with its seven stories and its  upturned gables, like the rim of an official hat, is down-stream from  the city, and thus prevents wealth and prosperity being swept by the  current past the city.    Beyond there is a short but steep rapid. Before a strong wind with all  sail set we boldly entered it and determined which was the stronger, the  wind or the current. But, while we hung in the current calling and  whistling for the wind, the wind flagged for a moment; tension being  removed, the bow swung into the rocks; but the water was shallow, and in  a trice two of the boys had jumped into the water and were holding the  boat-sides. Then poling and pulling we crept up the rapid into smooth  water. Never was there any confusion, never a false stroke. To hear my  boys jabber in their unintelligible speech you pictured disorder, and  disaster, and wild excitement; to see them act you witnessed such  coolness, skill, and daring as you had rarely seen before. My boys were  all young. The captain was only twenty, and was a model of physical  grace, with a face that will gladden the heart of the Chinese maiden  whom he condescends to select to be the mother of his children.    Junks were making slow progress up the river. The towpath is here on the  left bank, sixty feet above the present level of the river. Barefooted  trackers, often one hundred in a gang, clamber over the rocks \"like a  pack of hounds in full cry,\" each with the coupling over his shoulder  and all singing in chorus, the junk they are towing often a quarter of a  mile astern of them. When a rapid intervenes they strain like bondmen at  the towrope; the line creaks under the enormous tension but holds fast.  On board the junk, a drum tattoo is beaten and fire-crackers let off,  and a dozen men with long ironshod bamboos sheer the vessel off the  rocks as foot by foot it is drawn past the obstruction. Contrast with  this toilsome slowness the speed of the junk bound down-stream. Its mast  is shipped; its prodigious bow-sweep projects like a low bowsprit; the  after deck is covered as far as midships with arched mat-roof;"]]]
