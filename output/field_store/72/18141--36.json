Further, it gives  thee occasion for doubt, that the souls appear to return to the  stars, in accordance with the opinion of Plato.[1] These are the  questions that thrust equally upon thy wish; and therefore I will  treat first of that which hath the most venom.[2]    [1] Plato, in his Timaeus (41, 42), says that the creator of the  universe assigned each soul to a star, whence they were to be  sown in the vessels of time. \" He who lived well during his  appointed time was to return to the star which was his  habitation, and there he would have a blessed and suitable  existence.\" Dante's doubt has arisen from the words of Piccarda,  which implied that her station was in the sphere of the Moon.    [2] The conception that the souls after death had their abode in  the stars would be a definite heresy, and hence far more  dangerous than a question concerning the justice of Heaven, for  such a question might be consistent with entire faith in that  justice.      \"Of the Seraphim he who is most in God, Moses, Samuel, and  whichever John thou wilt take, I say, and even Mary, have not  their seats in another heaven than those spirits who just now  appeared to thee, nor have they more or fewer years for their  existence; but all make beautiful the first circle, and have  sweet life in different measure, through feeling more or less the  eternal breath.[1] They showed themselves here, not because this  sphere is allotted to them, but to afford sign of the celestial  condition which is least exalted. To speak thus is befitting to  your mind, since only by objects of the sense doth it apprehend  that which it then makes worthy of the understanding. For this  reason the Scripture condescends to your capacity, and attributes  feet and hands to God, while meaning otherwise; and Holy Church  represents to you with human aspect Gabriel and Michael and the  other who made Tobias whole again.[2] That which Timaeus, reasons  of the souls is not like this which is seen here, since it seems  that he thinks as he says. He says that the soul returns to its  own star, believing it to have been severed thence, when nature  gave it as the form.[3] And perchance his opinion is of other  guise than his words sound, and may be of a meaning not to be  derided. If he means that the honor of their influence and the  blame returns to these wheels, perhaps his bow hits on some  truth. This principle, ill understood, formerly turned awry  almost the whole world, so that it ran astray in naming Jove,  Mercury, and Mars.[4]    [1] The abode of all the blessed is the Empyrean,--the first  circle, counting from above; but there are degrees in  blessedness, each spirit enjoying according to its capacity; no  one is conscious of any lack.    [2] The archangel Raphael.    [3] The intellectual soul is united with the body as its  substantial form. That by means of which anything performs its  functions (operatur) is its form. The soul is that by which the  body lives, and hence is its form.--Summa Theol., I. lxxvi. 1,  6, 7.    [4] The belief in the influence of the stars led men to assign  to them divine powers, and to name their gods after them.      The other dubitation which disturbs thee has less venom, for  its malice could not lead thee from me elsewhere. That our  justice seems unjust in the eyes of mortals is argument of  faith,[1] and not of heretical iniquity. But in order that your  perception may surely penetrate unto this truth, I will make thee  content, as thou desirest. Though there be violence when he who  suffers nowise consents to him who compels, these souls were not  by reason of that excused; for will, unless it wills, is not  quenched,[2] but does as nature does in fire, though violence a  thousand times may wrest it. Wherefore if it bend much or little,  it follows the force; and thus these did, having power to return  to the holy place. If their will had been entire, such as held  Lawrence on the gridiron, and made Mucius severe unto his hand,  it would have urged them back, so soon as they were loosed, along  the road on which they had been dragged; but will so firm is too  rare. And by these words, if thou hast gathered them up as thou  shouldst, is the argument quashed that would have given thee  annoy yet many times.    [1] Mortals would not trouble themselves concerning the justice  of God, unless they had faith in it. These perplexities are then  arguments or proofs of faith; as St. Thomas Aquinas says, \"The  merit of faith consists in believing what one does not see.\" But  in this case, as Beatrice goes on to show, mere human  intelligence if Sufficient to see that the injustice is only  apparent.    [2] Violence has no power over the will; the original will may,  however, by act of will, be changed.      \"But now another path runs traverse before thine eyes, such that  by thyself thou wouldst not issue forth therefrom ere thou wert  weary. I have put it in thy mind for certain, that a soul in  bliss cannot lie, since it is always near to the Primal Truth;  and then thou hast heard from Piccarda that Constance retained  affection for the veil; so that she seems in this to contradict  me. Often ere now, brother, has it happened that, in order to  escape peril, that which it was not meet to do has been done  against one's liking; even as Alcmaeon (who thereto entreated by  his father, slew his own mother), not to lose piety, pitiless  became. On this point, I wish thee to think that the violence is  mingled with the will, and they so act that the offences cannot  be excused. Absolute will consents not to the wrong; but the will  in so far consents thereto, as it fears, if it draw back, to fall  into greater trouble. Therefore when Piccarda says that, she  means it of the absolute will; and I of the other so that we both  speak truth alike.\"    Such was the current of the holy stream which issued from the  fount whence every truth flows forth; and such it set at rest one  and the other desire.    \"O beloved of the First Lover, O divine one,\" said I then, \"whose  speech inundates me, and warms me so that more and more it  quickens me, my affection is not so profound that it can suffice  to render to you grace for grace, but may He who sees and can,  respond for this. I clearly see that our intellect is never  satisfied unless the Truth illume it, outside of which no truth  extends. In that it reposes, as a wild beast in his lair, soon as  it has reached it: and it can reach it; otherwise every desire  would be in vain. Because of this,[1] the doubt, in likeness of a  shoot, springs up at the foot of the truth; and it is nature  which urges us to the summit from height to height. This[2]  invites me, this gives me assurance, Lady, with reverence to ask  you of another truth which is obscure to me. I wish to know if  man can make satisfaction to you[3] for defective vows with other  goods, so that in your scales they may not be light?\" looked at  we with such divine eyes, full of the sparks of love, that my  power, vanquished, turned its back, and almost I lost myself with  eyes cast down.    [1] Of this constant desire for truth.    [2] This natural impulse.    [3] To you, that is, to the court of Heaven.        CANTO V. The sanctity of vows, and the seriousness with which  they are to be made or changed.--Ascent to the Heaven of  Mercury.--The shade of Justinian.    \"If I flame upon thee in the heat of love, beyond the fashion  that on earth is seen, go that I vanquish the valor of thine  eyes, marvel not, for it proceeds from perfect vision,[1] which  according as it apprehends, so moves its feet to the apprehended  good. I see clearly how already shines in thy intellect the  eternal light, which, being seen, alone ever enkindles love. And  if any other thing seduce your love, it is naught but some  vestige of that, illrecognized, which therein shines through.  Thou wishest to know if for a defective vow so much can be  rendered with other service as may secure the soul from suit.\"    [1] From the brightness of my eyes illuminated by the divine  light.      Thus Beatrice began this canto, and even as one who breaks not  off his speech, she thus continued her holy discourse. \"The  greatest gift which God in His largess bestowed in creating, and  the most conformed unto His goodness and that which He esteems  the most, was the freedom of the will, with which all the  creatures of intelligence, and they alone, were and are endowed.  Now will appear to thee, if from this thou reasonest, the high  worth of the vow, if it be such that God consent when thou  consentest;[1] for, in closing the compact between God and man,  sacrifice is made of this treasure, which is such as I say, and  it is made by its own act. What then can be rendered in  compensation? If thou thinkest to make good use of that which  thou hast offered, with illgotten gain thou wouldst do good  work.[2]    [1] If the vow be valid through its acceptance by God.    [2] The intent to put what had been vowed to another (though  good) use, affords no excuse for breaking a vow.      \"Thou art now assured of the greater point; but since Holy Church  in this gives dispensation, which seems contrary to the truth  which I have disclosed to thee, it behoves thee still to sit a  little at table, because the tough food which thou hast taken  requires still some aid for thy digestion. Open thy mind to that  which I reveal to thee, and enclose it therewithin; for to have  heard without retaining doth not make knowledge.    \"Two things combine in the essence of this sacrifice; the one is  that of which it consists, the other is the covenant. This last  is never cancelled if it be not kept; and concerning this has  my preceding speech been so precise. On this account it was  necessary for the Hebrews still to make offering, although some  part of the offering might be changed, as thou shouldst know.[1]  The other, which as the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19979"],[0,"A Righte Merrie Christmasse: The Story of Christ-Tide (#4)"],[1," lodgings. This  assemblie of the princes cost the archbishop verie deerelie in  feasting and banketting them and their traines. At one dinner it was  reported he spent at the first course three score fat oxen.\"    Edward I. had, at two separate times, as Christmas guests Llewellyn of  Wales and Baliol of Scotland. Edward II. kept one feast of the  Nativity at York in 1311, revelling with Piers Gaveston and his  companions; but that of 1326 was spent in prison at Kenilworth, whilst  his wife and son enjoyed themselves at Wallingford. Strange and sad  guests, too, must the captive King of France and David of Scotland  have been at Edward III.'s Christ-tide feast in 1358 at Westminster.    Richard II. came to the throne 21st June 1377, a boy of eleven years,  and I think Stow has made a mistake in a year in the following  account, because at the date he gives he would have been king instead  of prince.    \"One other show, in the year 1377, made by the citizens for the  disport of the young prince Richard, son to the Black Prince, in the  feast of Christmas, in this manner:--On the Sunday before Candlemas,  in the night, one hundred and thirty citizens, disguised and well  horsed, in a mummery, with sound of trumpets, sackbuts, cornets,  shalmes, and other minstrels, and innumerable torch lights of wax,  rode from Newgate through Cheape, over the bridge, through  Southwarke, and so to Kennington beside Lambheth, where the young  prince remained with his mother and the Duke of Lancaster, his uncle,  the Earls of Cambridge, Hertford, Warwicke, and Suffolke, with divers  other lords. In the first rank did ride forty-eight in the likeness  and habit of Esquires, two and two together, clothed in red coats and  gowns of say or sandal, with comely visors on their faces; after them  came forty-eight Knights, in the same livery of colour and stuff; then  followed one richly arrayed like an Emperor; and, after him some  distance, one stately attired like a Pope, whom followed twenty-four  Cardinals; and, after them, eight or ten with black visors, not  amiable, as if they had been legates from some foreign princes. These  maskers, after they had entered Kennington, alighted from their  horses, and entered the hall on foot; which done, the prince, his  mother, and the lords, came out of the chamber into the hall, whom the  said mummers did salute, showing by a pair of dice upon the table  their desire to play with the prince, which they so handled, that the  prince did always win when he cast them. Then the mummers set to the  prince three jewels, one after the other, which were a bowl of gold, a  cup of gold, and a ring of gold, which the prince won at three casts.  Then they set to the prince's mother, the duke, the earls, and other  lords, to every one a ring of gold, which they did also win. After  which they were feasted, and the music sounded, the prince and lords  danced on the one part with the mummers, which did also dance; which  jollity being ended, they were again made to drink, and then departed  in order as they came.\"    When he came to the throne as Richard II. he had very enlarged ideas  on expenditure, and amongst others on Christmas feasts. He held one at  Lichfield in 1398, where the Pope's Nuncio and several foreign  noblemen were present, and he was obliged to enlarge the episcopal  palace in order to accommodate his guests. Stow tells us: \"This yeere  King Richarde kept his Christmas at Liechfield, where he spent in the  Christmas time 200 tunns of wine, and 2000 oxen with their  appurtenances.\" But then he is said to have had 2000 cooks, and  cookery was then elevated into a science: so much so, that the  earliest cookery book that has come down to us is _The Forme of  Cury_, which \"was compiled of the chef Mairt Cok of Kyng Richard the  Secunde, Kyng of .nglond[4] aftir the Conquest.\" Twenty-eight oxen,  three hundred sheep, an incredible number of fowls, and all kinds of  game were slaughtered every morning for the use of his household. It  seems incredible, but see what old John Hardyng, the metrical  chronicler, says:--         Truly I herd Robert Ireleffe saye,         Clerke of the grene cloth, y^{t} to the household,       Came euery daye for moost partie alwaye,         Ten thousand folke by his messis tould,       That folowed the hous aye as thei would,         And in the kechin three hundred seruitours,         And in eche office many occupiours;         And ladies faire with their gentilwomen,         Chamberers also and launderers,       Three hundred of them were occupied then.    [Footnote 4: [Transcriber's Note: \".nglond\" appears in the original.  An 18th-Century annotated edition of _The Forme of Cury_ notes that in  the original manuscript, \"E was intended to be prefixed in red ink\" in  place of the leading period. See Pegge, Samuel, _The Forme of Cury_,  p. 1, note c (London: J. Nichols, 1780) (page image available at  http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/foc/FoC042.html).]]    Of the Christ-tides of Henry IV. there are no events recorded, except  that Stow states that \"in the 2nd of his reign, he then keeping his  Christmas at Eltham, twelve aldermen and their sons rode in a mumming,  and had great thanks,\" but Henry V. had at least one sweet Christmas  day. It was in the year 1418, when he was besieging Rouen, and  Holinshed thus describes the sufferings of the garrison. \"If I should  rehearse (according to the report of diverse writers) how deerelie  dogs, rats, mise, and cats were sold within the towne, and how  greedilie they were by the poore people eaten and devoured, and how  the people dailie died for fault of food, and young infants laie  sucking in the streets on their mother's breasts, lieng dead, starved  for hunger; the reader might lament their extreme miseries. A great  number of poore sillie creatures were put out at the gates, which were  by the Englishmen that kept the trenches, beaten and driven backe  againe to the same gates, which they found closed and shut against  them. And so they laie betweene the wals of the citie and the trenches  of the enimies, still crieing for helpe and releefe, for lacke whereof  great numbers of them dailie died.    \"Howbeit, King Henrie, moved with pitie, upon Christmasse daie, in  the honor of Christes Nativitie, refreshed all the poore people with  vittels, to their great comfort and his high praise.\"    There are no notable Christ-tides until we come to the reign of Henry  VIII. In the second year of his reign he kept Christmas quietly at  Richmond, the queen being near her confinement, which event taking  place on the first of January, she was sufficiently recovered to look  at the festivities on Twelfth day. \"Against the twelfe daie, or the  daie of the Epiphanie, at night, before the banket in the hall at  Richmond, was a pageant devised like a mounteine, and set with stones;  on the top of which mounteine was a tree of gold, the branches and  boughes frised with gold, spreading on everie side over the mounteine,  with roses and pomegranates, the which mounteine was, with vices,  brought up towards the king, and out of the same came a ladie  apparelled in cloth of gold, and the children of honour called the  henchmen, which were freshlie disguised, and danced a morice before  the king; and, that done, re-entered the mounteine, which was then  drawen backe, and then was the wassail or banket brought in, and so  brake up Christmasse.\"    However the queen was better next year, and \"In this yeare the king  kept his Christmasse at Greenewich, where was such abundance of viands  served to all comers of anie honest behaviour, as hath beene few times  seene. And against New Yeeres night was made in the hall a castell,  gates, towers, and dungeon, garnished with artillerie and weapon,  after the most warlike fashion: and on the front of the castell was  written _Le forteresse dangereux_, and, within the castell were six  ladies cloathed in russet sattin, laid all over with leaves of gold,  and everie one knit with laces of blew silke and gold. On their heads,  coifs and caps all of gold. After this castell had beene caried about  the hall, and the queene had beheld it, in came the king with five  other, apparelled in coats, the one half of russet sattin, the other  halfe of rich cloth of gold; on their heads caps of russet sattin  embrodered with works of fine gold bullion.    \"These six assaulted the castell. The ladies seeing them so lustie and  couragious, were content to solace with them, and upon further  communication to yeeld the castell, and so they came downe and dansed  a long space. And after, the ladies led the knights into the castell,  and then the castell suddenlie vanished out of their sights. On the  daie of the Epiphanie at night, the king, with eleven other, were  disguised, after the manner of Italie; called a maske, a thing not  seene before, in England; they were apparelled in garments long and  broad, wrought all with gold, with visors and caps of gold. And, after  the banket done, these maskers came in, with six gentlemen disguised  in silke, bearing staffe torches, and desired the ladies to danse:  some were content, and some refused. And, after they had dansed, and  communed togither, as the fashion of the maske is, they tooke their  leave and departed, and so did the queene and all the ladies.\"    In 1513, \"The king kept a solemne Christmasse at Greenwich, with  danses and mummeries in most princelie manner. And on the Twelfe daie  at night came into the hall a mount, called _the_ rich mount. The  mount was set full of rich flowers of silke, and especiallie full of  broome slips full of cods, the branches were greene sattin, and the  flowers flat gold of damaske, which signified Plantagenet. On the top  stood a goodlie beacon giving light; round about the beacon sat the  king and five others, all in cotes and caps of right crimsin velvet,  embrodered with flat gold of damaske, their cotes set full of spangles"]]]
