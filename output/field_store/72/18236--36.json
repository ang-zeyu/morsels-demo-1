[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#4)"],[1,"Sunday. The organic Protestant Church of Germany--a  union of the Lutheran and Reformed churches,--has small affiliation  with the Church of Rome; but some observances which we have been  accustomed to associate with so-called Catholicism have lingered with  Protestantism in Germany. Good Friday was a solemn day in the family  where we had our home. Bach's music, brought to light after a hundred  years of deep obscurity by Felix Mendelssohn, and rendered, though at  first with much opposition from musicians of the old school, in the  Sing Akademie of Berlin, now lends every year, on the eve of Good  Friday, its incomparable _Passion-Musik_ to the devotion of the  occasion. \"There are many things I must miss,\" said a cultivated  German to me, \"but the _Passion-Musik_ on the eve of Good  Friday,--never! It makes me better. I cannot do without it.\" We found  this music, at the time of which we speak, an occasion to be ever  memorable for its wonderful power and pathos. The next morning we did  not attend the service in the cathedral, where we wished to go,  knowing that the crowd would be too great for comfort. On returning to  our room from another service, a beautiful arrangement of cut flowers  on the table greeted our senses as we opened the door. It was the  thoughtful, affectionate, and devout offering of our hostess in  reverent memory of the day. After dinner we entered the private parlor  of the family for a friendly call and to express our thanks. No  suggestion of knitting or fancy-work was to be seen. The hostess and  her daughters, soberly dressed, were reading devotional books. \"Do you  not go out this afternoon?\" I inquired. \"No, one cannot go out,\" was  the reply, indicating probably both lack of disposition and of places  open for entertainment. Later, I ventured out for a walk. Only here  and there could a team be seen, and the throng of pedestrians usually  on the sidewalks in a bright spring afternoon seemed to have deserted  the busy streets, in which comparative silence reigned.    \"I am glad there is here _one_ sabbath in the year,\" was our inward  comment, \"even though it falls on a Friday.\" Easter was a day of  gladness in the churches, though elaborate adornments of flowers and  new spring bonnets were not so prominent as in American cities. The  respectable church communicant, even if he goes to church on no other  day in the year, usually takes the communion at Easter.    Easter Monday was one great gala-day. All Berlin seemed to be in the  streets in holiday attire; and, to our eyes, no other day ever showed  such universal gladness reflected in the faces and demeanor of the  people. \"Prayer Day,\" answering somewhat to the original New England  Fast Day, was solemnly observed in May; and the holidays of  Whitsuntide dress every house and market-stall and milk-cart with  green boughs, and crowd the railways and the steamers with throngs of  pleasure-seekers.    The few weeks before Easter is a favorite season for weddings, and  these are invariably celebrated in church. Even people in moderate  circumstances make much display at the church ceremony, with or  without an additional celebration at home. We were invited to one at  the Garrison Church, which the soldiers attend, and where most of the  pews on the main floor are held by officers and their families. We  entered the church fifteen minutes before the hour appointed,--four  o'clock. An elderly usher in a fine suit, with swallow-tail coat and a  decoration on his breast, politely gave us liberty to choose our  seats, as the invitations were not numerous and the church is large. A  few persons, mostly ladies, were there before us, and had already  taken the best seats,--those running lengthwise of the church, and  facing a wide central aisle. We joined them, and while waiting felt  more at liberty to inspect the church than at the service on a  previous Sunday. The Grecian interior was undecorated, except that a  mass of green filled the space to the right and left of the altar,  beginning on each side with tall oleanders succeeded by laurels and  other evergreens, growing gradually less in height, until they reached  the pews in the side aisles. A rich altar-cloth of purple velvet,  embroidered with gold, fell below the crucifix and the massive candles  on either side, which are always seen in the Lutheran churches; and in  the aisle below the chancel stood a square altar, covered with another  spread of purple velvet, heavy with gold fringe and embroidery. Two  chairs were side by side just in front of the high altar, and facing  it. Six chairs facing the audience were on the platform on each side  of the altar, directly in front of the mass of green I have described.  Below the steps to the chancel about twenty chairs were placed on each  side of the central aisle, and facing the altar. In each chair was a  printed slip containing a hymn to be sung after the ceremony. About  four o'clock a maid came in with the little granddaughter who on  Christmas eve had spoken the poem at the lighting of the family  Christmas-tree. When they were seated, the handsome little face, with  its white bonnet and cloak, was seen in a side pew very near the  altar. It seemed so like a dream,--the announcement of the engagement  of \"the little Fraeulein\" at that Christmas party; and now the time has  come when the bride is to belong to her mother and her home no more!    Ladies had long ceased looking impatiently at their watches, and were  perhaps busy with their thoughts, as I was, when from the \"mittel\"  door Court-preacher Frommel entered, his long white hair thrown back,  and crossed through the transverse aisle to the robing-room opposite.  Soon a signal given by an usher to the organist was the prelude to  solemn music, which filled the church; and a stout clerical  assistant, with a book under his arm, appeared at the rear door. Then  Pastor Frommel, in his black robe and simple white muslin bands, took  his place before the high altar and bowed in prayer, the two immense  candles in tall candlesticks on either side the altar, now lighted,  throwing their radiance on his silver hair. Meantime the bridal  procession slowly moved down the side aisle toward the middle of the  church, turned at the transverse aisle, crossed to the centre, turned  again, now toward the altar, passing to it up the central aisle. The  clerical personage with the service-book under his arm passed first.  Then came the bride on the arm of the groom. There were a few  orange-buds hidden here and there in the fluffy mass of her front  hair; a veil of tulle was fastened behind them in a gathered coronet,  and fell down over the folds of her white silk dress, whose train  swept along the aisle to the length of a yard and a half. I saw no  ornaments, save a wreath below the high, full, white ruche at the  throat, perhaps of geranium leaves, and a full bouquet of pink  rosebuds in the right hand. From my glance at the train of the bridal  dress, I looked up to see six bridesmaids coming after, each on the  arm of a groomsman. The first bridesmaid was a lovely sister of the  bride, in a dress of cream-white silk without train, pink flowers in  her hair, and carrying a large bouquet of full-blown cream and crimson  roses. The second bridesmaid wore a dress of silk,--not ecru and not  palest olive, but a shade between the two,--with a perfectly fitting  corsage, likewise _decollete_, and for ornaments a necklace of large  pearls, a bouquet, and flowers in her hair. The first groomsman was in  civilian's dress; but the second was in all the glory of full  regimentals, with scarlet trimmings and showy buttons. The third  bridesmaid wore pink silk, with a bouquet at the centre of the  heart-shaped corsage; but unlike the others, she had no flowers in her  hair. Of the following bridesmaids, one wore pink silk of a paler  shade, one was in lemon-color, and the last in palest mauve, with  trimmings of garnet velvet. The bridesmaids filed to the right, and  the groomsmen to the left, as they reached the altar, before which  Pastor Frommel now stood. As the bride and groom approached, they  remained a moment standing with bowed heads in silent prayer, as the  custom is on entering a German church, and then took the two chairs  which had been placed for them, facing the minister. I had been struck  by the beauty of the widowed mother, as she followed the bridesmaids,  leaning on the arm of her brother,--a fine-looking, dignified officer  from Potsdam, in full uniform, with broad silver epaulettes. The black  hair of the mother--dressed high and gracefully on the crown of her  uncovered head, set off by a fine white marguerite and a yellow  one--and her dark eyes and complexion were in strong contrast to the  fair hair and light German complexion of the younger ladies. She was  in a dress of garnet silk, fitting perfectly her tall and graceful  form. The bridesmaids took the six chairs on the right of the altar,  facing the audience and before the mass of greenery, which made an  effective background for so much youth, beauty, and elegance; and the  groomsmen took the corresponding chairs on the left. The mother and  uncle parted at the steps below the altar, she taking the first chair  on the right, and he on the left, with the central aisle between them.  Next came two elderly ladies, in dark silk with long trains, with  uncovered and ornamented hair, and white shoulder-shawls of silk or  wool, each with a gentleman; and they were seated to the right and  left respectively. The bride's eldest married sister came next, in a  splendid robe of blue satin, with a long train, looking very young and  _distingue_. She and her husband filed to the right and left, as the  others had done. The second married sister of the bride followed, in a  similar dress of pink satin; and her very handsome husband, in his  full military suit, was a decided addition to the courtly-looking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#4)"],[1," home before it's dark, though?\"    \"Well, no! But the head lights are working all right--I tried them  before we started.\"    \"It will be fun to drive in the dark!\" chuckled the boys behind.    \"I hope we shall be back before Grandfather and Cousin Clare, though,\"  said Dulcie a little uneasily.    The road over the Cleland Hills was much wilder than they expected, and  it was very stony and bad. Up and up they went till walls, hedges and  farms had disappeared, and only the lonely moor lay on either side of  the rough track. It was a place where no motorist in his senses would  have ventured to take a car, the extreme roughness of the road made  steering difficult, and the strain on the tires was enormous. Instead of  driving cautiously, Everard plunged along with all the hardihood of  youth, bumping anyhow over ruts and stones. They were just beyond the  brow of the hill when a loud bang, followed by a grinding sensation,  announced the bad news that one of their tires had burst.    \"What beastly bad luck!\" lamented Everard, getting out to inspect the  injured cover. \"It might have had the decency to keep up till we had  reached civilization! Well, there's nothing for it but to put on the  spare tire. I've helped Milner to do it before, so I can manage. It's a  bother we left the spare wheel at home. I shall want some of you to help  me, though.\"    Everard had indeed rendered some assistance to the chauffeur on various  occasions, but it was quite another matter to perform the troublesome  operation of changing the tire with only two girls and three young  brothers to lend a hand. In their inexperienced enthusiasm, they did all  the wrong things, very nearly nipped the tube, mislaid the tools, and  pulled where they should have pushed. It was only after nearly an hour's  work that Everard at last managed to get the business finished. The  family, warm and excited, packed once more into the car.    \"Well, I hope we shall have no more troubles now!\" exclaimed Lilias, who  was growing tired and longing for home and tea. \"What's the matter,  Everard?\"    \"Matter! Why, she won't start, that's all!\"    Here was a predicament! Whether the bumping up the rough road had thrown  some delicate piece of mechanism out of gear, or the waiting in the cold  had cooled the engine, it was impossible to say, but nothing that  Everard could do would induce the car to start. He examined everything  which his rather limited knowledge of motorology suggested might be the  cause of the stoppage, but with no result. After half an hour's  tinkering, he was obliged ruefully to acknowledge himself utterly  baffled.    They were indeed in an extremely awkward situation, stranded on a wild  moor, probably sixty miles from home, and with the short winter's day  closing rapidly in.    \"What _are_ we to do?\" gasped Lilias, half-crying.    \"We can't stay here all night!\"    \"Finish our prog and sleep in the car,\" suggested Roland.    \"No, no! We should be frozen before morning.\"    \"I think we'd better walk on while it's light enough to see,\" said  Everard. \"We shall probably strike a highroad soon, and we'll stop some  motorist, ask for a lift to the nearest town, and stay all night at a  hotel.\"    \"But what about the car?\"    \"We must just leave her to her fate. There's nothing else for it. I  don't suppose anybody will touch her up here. It can't be helped, any  way.\"    \"Let's finish our prog before we set off!\" persisted Roland, opening the  picnic basket.    The family was hungry again, so they readily set to work to dispose of  the remains of their lunch. It might be a long time before they were  within reach of their next meal, and they blessed Cook for having packed  a plentiful supply. Everard would not let them linger for more than a  few minutes.    \"Hurry up, you kids!\" he urged. \"We don't know how far we may have to  go, and it will be getting dark soon. Thank goodness we shall be  walking down hill, at any rate.\"    [Illustration: \"WHAT _ARE_ WE TO DO!\" GASPED LILIAS]    After whisking along in the car, \"Shanks's pony\" seemed a very slow mode  of progress; their breakdown had happened in an out-of-the-way spot, and  it was more than an hour before they reached a highroad. It was almost  dark by that time, and matters seemed so desperate that Everard  determined to hail the very first passing motorist who seemed to be able  to help them. Fate brought along no handsome tourist car, but a rattling  motor-lorry, the driver of which stopped in answer to their united  shouts, and, after hearing of the difficulty they were in, consented to  give them a lift to the town, five miles away, for which he was bound.  Fortunately the lorry was empty, so the family thankfully climbed in,  and squatted on the floor, while Everard sat in front with the driver.    It was not a very aristocratic mode of conveyance for the heir of  Cheverley Chase, but Everard was in no mood to pick and choose just  then, and would have accepted a seat in a coal truck if necessary. As  for the younger ones, they enjoyed the fun of it. It was a very bumpy  performance to sit on the floor of the jolting wagon, but at any rate  infinitely preferable to walking.    Arrived in Bilstone, their cicerone drove them to a Commercial Hotel  with whose landlady he had some acquaintance, and that good dame, after  eyeing the party curiously, consented to make up beds for them for the  night.    \"I've no private sitting-room to put you in, and I can't show these  young ladies into the commercial room,\" she objected; \"but I'll have a  fire lighted in one of the bedrooms, and you can all have some tea up  there. Will that suit you?\"    Lilias and Dulcie, catching a glimpse through an open door of the  company smoking in the commercial room, agreed thankfully, glad to find  some safe haven to which they could beat a retreat.    \"I wonder what Cousin Clare would say?\" they asked each other.    It was indeed an urgent matter to send some news of their whereabouts to  Cheverley Chase, where their absence must be causing much alarm. While  the landlady, therefore, ordered the tea, Everard went out to the public  telephone, asked for a trunk call, and rang up No. 169 Balderton. He  could hear relief in the voice of old Winder, who answered the  telephone. Everard was not anxious to enter into too many explanations,  so he simply said that they had had a breakdown, told the name of the  town and the hotel where they were staying, and suggested that Milner  should come over next morning to the rescue. On hearing his  Grandfather's voice, he promptly rang off. To-morrow would be quite  time enough, so he felt, for giving the history of their adventure. The  unpleasant interview might just as well be deferred, and he had no wish  to listen to explosions of anger over the telephone.    Tea, tinned salmon, plum and apple jam, and very indifferent bedrooms  were the best that the Commercial Hotel had to offer, but it was  infinitely better than being benighted on the moor. In spite of lack of  all toilet necessaries, the Ingletons slept peacefully, worn out with  their long day in the fresh air. Milner, the chauffeur, must have made  an early start, for he arrived at eleven o'clock next morning in the  small car, armed with his master's instructions. He paid the hotel bill,  chartered a taxi, in which he dispatched Lilias, Dulcie, Roland, Bevis  and Clifford, straight for home, then, engaging a mechanic from a  garage, and taking Everard as guide, he started up the hill in the  pouring rain to find the abandoned car. It needed several hours'  attention before it could be induced to start, and it was not until  evening that he was able to place it safely back in the motor-house at  Cheverley Chase.    Everard had expected his peppery grandfather to be angry, but he was  quite unprepared for the intensity of the storm which burst over his  head on his return.    \"Your insolence goes beyond all bounds!\" thundered Mr. Ingleton. \"To  borrow my car without leave! And to take your sisters without a chaperon  to a fifth-rate public-house! You deserve horsewhipping for it! You  think yourself the young Squire, do you? And imagine you can do just  what you like here? While I'm above ground I'll have you to know _I'm_  master, and nobody else in this place!\"    \"I can't see it was anything so out of the way to take the kids a run in  the car, and I never meant to keep the girls out all night,\" replied  Everard defiantly. He had a temper as well as his grandfather, and the  pair had often been at loggerheads before.    \"Indeed! There are ways of making people see! You can just go a little  too far sometimes!\" declared the old gentleman sarcastically. \"I've  given orders that you don't take either car out again unless Milner is  with you. So you understand?\"    \"I suppose I do,\" grunted Everard, turning sulkily away.    It was only a few days after this that Everard, Lilias, and Dulcie,  returning home across the park from a walk in the woods, met Mr. Bowden,  the family solicitor, who was riding down the drive from the Chase. He  stopped his motor-bicycle and got off to speak to them. They knew him  well, for he often came to the house to conduct their grandfather's  business, and he was indeed quite a favorite with them all. He looked at  Everard keenly when the first greetings were over.    \"Been getting yourself into considerable hot water just lately, haven't  you?\" he remarked.    Everard colored and frowned, then burst forth.    \"Grandfather's quite too ridiculous! Why shouldn't I take out the car if  I want to? I can drive as well as Milner! He behaved as if I were a kid!  It's more than a fellow can stand sometimes! He likes to keep everything  tight in his own hands; at his age it's time he began to stand aside a  little and let _me_ look after things! I shall have to take charge of  the whole property some day, I suppose!\"    Mr. Bowden was gazing at Everard with the noncommittal air"]]]
