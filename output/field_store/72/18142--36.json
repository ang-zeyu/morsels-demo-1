That his whole life, on the contrary, must, if it is  healthy life, be continually one of ploughing and pruning, rebuking and  helping, governing and punishing; and that therefore it is only in the  concession of some great principle of restraint and interference in  national action that he can ever hope to find the secret of protection  against national degradation. I believe that the masses have a right to  claim education from their government; but only so far as they  acknowledge the duty of yielding obedience to their government. I  believe they have a right to claim employment from their governors; but  only so far as they yield to the governor the direction and discipline  of their labour; and it is only so far as they grant to the men whom  they may set over them the father's authority to check the  childishnesses of national fancy, and direct the waywardnesses of  national energy, that they have a right to ask that none of their  distresses should be unrelieved, none of their weaknesses unwatched; and  that no grief, nor nakedness, nor peril, should exist for them, against  which the father's hand was not outstretched, or the father's shield  uplifted.[3]    [Note 3: Compare Wordsworth's Essay on the Poor Law Amendment Bill.  I quote one important passage: \"But, if it be not safe to touch the  abstract question of man's right in a social state to help himself even  in the last extremity, may we not still contend for the duty of a  Christian government, standing _in loco parentis_ towards all its  subjects, to make such effectual provision that no one shall be in  danger of perishing either through the neglect or harshness of its  legislation? Or, waiving this, is it not indisputable that the claim of  the State to the allegiance, involves the protection of the subject?  And, as all rights in one party impose a correlative duty upon another,  it follows that the right of the State to require the services of its  members, even to the jeopardizing of their lives in the common defence,  establishes a right in the people (not to be gainsaid by utilitarians  and economists) to public support when, from any cause, they may be  unable to support themselves.\"--(See note 2nd, in Addenda.)]    17. Now, I have pressed this upon you at more length than is needful or  proportioned to our present purposes of inquiry, because I would not for  the first time speak to you on this subject of political economy without  clearly stating what I believe to be its first grand principle. But its  bearing on the matter in hand is chiefly to prevent you from at once too  violently dissenting from me when what I may state to you as advisable  economy in art appears to imply too much restraint or interference with  the freedom of the patron or artist. We are a little apt, though on the  whole a prudent nation, to act too immediately on our impulses, even in  matters merely commercial; much more in those involving continual  appeals to our fancies. How far, therefore, the proposed systems or  restraints may be advisable, it is for you to judge; only I pray you not  to be offended with them merely because they _are_ systems and  restraints.      18. Do you at all recollect that interesting passage of Carlyle, in  which he compares, in this country and at this day, the understood and  commercial value of man and horse; and in which he wonders that the  horse, with its inferior brains and its awkward hoofiness, instead of  handiness, should be always worth so many tens or scores of pounds in  the market, while the man, so far from always commanding his price in  the market, would often be thought to confer a service on the community  by simply killing himself out of their way? Well, Carlyle does not  answer his own question, because he supposes we shall at once see the  answer. The value of the horse consists simply in the fact of your being  able to put a bridle on him. The value of the man consists precisely in  the same thing. If you can bridle him, or, which is better, if he can  bridle himself, he will be a valuable creature directly. Otherwise, in a  commercial point of view, his value is either nothing, or accidental  only. Only, of course, the proper bridle of man is not a leathern one:  what kind of texture it is rightly made of, we find from that command,  \"Be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding,  whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle.\" You are not to be  without the reins, indeed; but they are to be of another kind: \"I will  guide thee with mine Eye.\" So the bridle of man is to be the Eye of God;  and if he rejects that guidance, then the next best for him is the  horse's and the mule's, which have no understanding; and if he rejects  that, and takes the bit fairly in his teeth, then there is nothing left  for him than the blood that comes out of the city, up to the  horse-bridles.      19. Quitting, however, at last these general and serious laws of  government--or rather bringing them down to our own business in hand--we  have to consider three points of discipline in that particular branch of  human labour which is concerned, not with procuring of food, but the  expression of emotion; we have to consider respecting art: first, how to  apply our labour to it; then, how to accumulate or preserve the results  of labour; and then, how to distribute them. But since in art the labour  which we have to employ is the labour of a particular class of men--men  who have special genius for the business--we have not only to consider  how to apply the labour, but, first of all, how to produce the labourer;  and thus the question in this particular case becomes fourfold: first,  how to get your man of genius; then, how to employ your man of genius;  then, how to accumulate and preserve his work in the greatest quantity;  and, lastly, how to distribute his work to the best national advantage.  Let us take up these questions in succession.      20. I. Discovery.--How are we to get our men of genius: that is to say,  by what means may we produce among us, at any given time, the greatest  quantity of effective art-intellect? A wide question, you say, involving  an account of all the best means of art education. Yes, but I do not  mean to go into the consideration of those; I want only to state the few  principles which lie at the foundation of the matter. Of these, the  first is that you have always to find your artist, not to make him; you  can't manufacture him, any more than you can manufacture gold. You can  find him, and refine him: you dig him out as he lies nugget-fashion in  the mountain-stream; you bring him home; and you make him into current  coin, or household plate, but not one grain of him can you originally  produce. A certain quantity of art-intellect is born annually in every  nation, greater or less according to the nature and cultivation of the  nation, or race of men; but a perfectly fixed quantity annually, not  increasable by one grain. You may lose it, or you may gather it; you may  let it lie loose in the ravine, and buried in the sands, or you may make  kings' thrones of it, and overlay temple gates with it, as you choose:  but the best you can do with it is always merely sifting, melting,  hammering, purifying--never creating.      21. And there is another thing notable about this artistical gold; not  only is it limited in quantity, but in use. You need not make thrones or  golden gates with it unless you like, but assuredly you can't do  anything else with it. You can't make knives of it, nor armour, nor  railroads. The gold won't cut you, and it won't carry you: put it to a  mechanical use, and you destroy it at once. It is quite true that in the  greatest artists, their proper artistical faculty is united with every  other; and you may make use of the other faculties, and let the  artistical one lie dormant. For aught I know, there may be two or three  Leonardo da Vincis employed at this moment in your harbours and  railroads: but you are not employing their Leonardesque or golden  faculty there,--you are only oppressing and destroying it. And the  artistical gift in average men is not joined with others: your born  painter, if you don't make a painter of him, won't be a first-rate  merchant, or lawyer; at all events, whatever he turns out, his own  special gift is unemployed by you; and in no wise helps him in that  other business. So here you have a certain quantity of a particular sort  of intelligence, produced for you annually by providential laws, which  you can only make use of by setting it to its own proper work, and which  any attempt to use otherwise involves the dead loss of so much human  energy.      22. Well then, supposing we wish to employ it, how is it to be best  discovered and refined? It is easily enough discovered. To wish to  employ it is to discover it. All that you need is, a school of trial[4]  in every important town, in which those idle farmers' lads whom their  masters never can keep out of mischief, and those stupid tailors'  'prentices who are always stitching the sleeves in wrong way upwards,  may have a try at this other trade; only this school of trial must not  be entirely regulated by formal laws of art education, but must  ultimately be the workshop of a good master painter, who will try the  lads with one kind of art and another, till he finds out what they are  fit for.    [Note 4: See note 3rd, in Addenda.]      23. Next, after your trial school, you want your easy and secure  employment, which is the matter of chief importance. For, even on the  present system, the boys who have really intense art capacity, generally  make painters of themselves; but then, the best half of their early  energy is lost in the battle of life. Before a good painter can get  employment, his mind has always been embittered, and his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19998"],[0,"Rural Architecture (#4)"],[1," feature which belongs to the houses of any class of our population  whatever. Not that the farm house should be like the town or the village  house, in character, style, or architecture, but that it should, in its  own proper character, express all the comfort, repose, and quietude  which belong to the retired and thoughtful occupation of him who  inhabits it. Sheltered in its own secluded, yet independent domain, with  a cheerful, _intelligent_ exterior, it should exhibit all the  pains-taking in home embellishment and rural decoration that becomes its  position, and which would make it an object of attraction and regard.             *       *       *       *       *                  RURAL ARCHITECTURE.           *       *       *       *       *      GENERAL SUGGESTIONS.      In ascertaining what is desirable to the conveniences, or the  necessities in our household arrangement, it may be not unprofitable to  look about us, and consider somewhat, the existing condition of the  structures too many of us now inhabit, and which, in the light of true  fitness for the objects designed, are inconvenient, absurd, and out of  all harmony of purpose; yet, under the guidance of a better skill, and a  moderate outlay, might be well adapted, in most cases, to our  convenience and comfort, and quite well, to a reasonable standard of  taste in architectural appearance.    At the threshold--not of the house, but of this treatise--it may be well  to remark that it is not here assumed that there has been neither skill,  ingenuity, nor occasional good taste exhibited, for many generations  back, in the United States, in the construction of farm and country  houses. On the contrary, there are found in the older states many farm  and country houses that are almost models, in their way, for convenience  in the main purposes required of structures of their kind, and such as  can hardly be altered for the better. Such, however, form the exception,  not the rule; yet instead of standing as objects for imitation, they  have been ruled out as antiquated, and unfit for modern builders to  consult, who have in the introduction of some real improvements, also  left out, or discarded much that is valuable, and, where true comfort is  concerned, indispensable to perfect housekeeping. Alteration is not  always improvement, and in the rage for innovation of all kinds, among  much that is valuable, a great deal in house-building has been  introduced that is absolutely pernicious. Take, for instance, some of  our ancient-looking country houses of the last century, which, in  America, we call old. See their ample dimensions; their heavy, massive  walls; their low, comfortable ceilings; their high gables; sharp roofs;  deep porches, and spreading eaves, and contrast them with the ambitious,  tall, proportionless, and card-sided things of a modern date, and draw  the comparison in true comfort, which the ancient mansion really  affords, by the side of the other. Bating its huge chimneys, its wide  fire-places, its heavy beams dropping below the ceiling overhead, and  the lack of some modern conveniences, which, to be added, would give all  that is desired, and every man possessed of a proper judgment will  concede the superiority to the house of the last century.    That American house-building of the last fifty years is out of joint,  requires no better proof than that the main improvements which have been  applied to our rural architecture, are in the English style of farm and  country houses of two or three centuries ago; so, in that particular, we  acknowledge the better taste and judgment of our ancestors. True, modern  luxury, and in some particulars, modern improvement has made obsolete,  if not absurd, many things considered indispensable in a ruder age. The  wide, rambling halls and rooms; the huge, deep fire-places in the  chimneys; the proximity of out-buildings, and the contiguity of stables,  ricks, and cattle-yards--all these are wisely contracted, dispensed  with, or thrown off to a proper distance; but instead of such style  being abandoned altogether, as has too often been done, the house itself  might better have been partially reformed, and the interior arrangement  adapted to modern convenience. Such changes have in some instances been  made; and when so, how often does the old mansion, with outward features  in good preservation, outspeak, in all the expression of home-bred  comforts, the flashy, gimcrack neighbor, which in its plenitude of  modern pretension looks so flauntingly down upon it!    We cannot, in the United States, consistently adopt the domestic  architecture of any other country, throughout, to our use. We are  different in our institutions, our habits, our agriculture, our  climates. Utility is our chief object, and coupled with that, the  indulgence of an agreeable taste may be permitted to every one who  creates a home for himself, or founds one for his family. The frequent  changes of estates incident to our laws, and the many inducements held  out to our people to change their locality or residence, in the hope of  bettering their condition, is a strong hindrance to the adoption of a  universally correct system in the construction of our buildings;  deadening, as the effect of such changes, that home feeling which should  be a prominent trait of agricultural character. An attachment to  locality is not a conspicuous trait of American character; and if there  be a people on earth boasting a high civilization and intelligence, who  are at the same time a roving race, the Americans are that people; and  we acknowledge it a blemish in our domestic and social constitution.    Such remark is not dropped invidiously, but as a reason why we have thus  far made so little progress in the arts of home embellishment, and in  clustering about our habitations those innumerable attractions which win  us to them sufficiently to repel the temptation so often presented to  our enterprise, our ambition, or love of gain--and these not always  successful--in seeking other and distant places of abode. If, then, this  tendency to change--a want of attachment to any one spot--is a reason  why we have been so indifferent to domestic architecture; and if the  study and practice of a better system of building tends to cultivate a  home feeling, why should it not be encouraged? Home attachment is a  virtue. Therefore let that virtue be cherished. And if any one study  tend to exalt our taste, and promote our enjoyment, let us cultivate  that study to the highest extent within our reach.          STYLE OF BUILDING.--MISCELLANEOUS.      Diversified as are the features of our country in climate, soil,  surface, and position, no one style of rural architecture is properly  adapted to the whole; and it is a gratifying incident to the indulgence  in a variety of taste, that we possess the opportunity which we desire  in its display to almost any extent in mode and effect. The Swiss chalet  may hang in the mountain pass; the pointed Gothic may shoot up among the  evergreens of the rugged hill-side; the Italian roof, with its  overlooking campanile, may command the wooded slope or the open plain;  or the quaint and shadowy style of the old English mansion, embosomed in  its vines and shrubbery, may nestle in the quiet, shaded valley, all  suited to their respective positions, and each in harmony with the  natural features by which it is surrounded. Nor does the effect which  such structures give to the landscape in an ornamental point of view,  require that they be more imposing in character than the necessities of  the occasion may demand. True economy demands a structure sufficiently  spacious to accommodate its occupants in the best manner, so far as  convenience and comfort are concerned in a dwelling; and its conformity  to just rules in architecture need not be additionally expensive or  troublesome. He who builds at all, if it be anything beyond a rude or  temporary shelter, may as easily and cheaply build in accordance with  correct rules of architecture, as against such rules; and it no more  requires an extravagance in cost or a wasteful occupation of room to  produce a given effect in a house suited to humble means, than in one of  profuse accommodation. Magnificence, or the attempt at magnificence in  building, is the great fault with Americans who aim to build out of the  common line; and the consequence of such attempt is too often a failure,  apparent, always, at a glance, and of course a perfect condemnation in  itself of the judgment as well as taste of him who undertakes it.    Holding our tenures as we do, with no privilege of entail to our  posterity, an eye to his own interest, or to that of his family who is  to succeed to his estate, should admonish the builder of a house to the  adoption of a plan which will, in case of the sale of the estate,  involve no serious loss. He should build such a house as will be no  detriment, in its expense, to the selling value of the land on which it  stands, and always fitted for the spot it occupies. Hence, an imitation  of the high, extended, castellated mansions of England, or the  Continent, although in miniature, are altogether unsuited to the  American farmer or planter, whose lands, instead of increasing in his  family, are continually subject to division, or to sale in mass, on his  own demise; and when the estate is encumbered with unnecessarily large  and expensive buildings, they become an absolute drawback to its value  in either event. An expensive house requires a corresponding expense to  maintain it, otherwise its effect is lost, and many a worthy owner of a  costly mansion has been driven to sell and abandon his estate  altogether, from his unwillingness or inability to support \"the  establishment\" which it entailed; when, if the dwelling were only such  as the estate required and could reasonably maintain, a contented and  happy home would have remained to"]]]
