They are immediately told that the Cause is  nothing more than a sect of Islam; a Movement that may do immense good to  the Muhammadan world, but far from ranking with Christianity or satisfying  its needs. Then they refer this ignorant and innocent person to books such  as Brown's. It is their fault for having gone to the wrong source for  proper information, but once they have gone it is not their mistake to  have been misled. We have heard of many such instances and there is  absolutely no remedy except to leave them until they find the truth for  themselves. We can only pray for their guidance.    Shoghi Effendi always prays for you as well as the other Auckland friends,  so that through your combined efforts the Cause may prosper there, and  obtain a strong position in the life of the people. I am not the least  familiar with the social conditions there, but I am sure there is a ready  field for active service.    Yours in His Name,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear fellow-worker:_    _I rejoice to learn that your dear sons are realizing gradually the  significance of this unique and mighty Cause, and my constant and fervent  prayer is that you may witness erelong the fruition of their slow yet sure  spiritual evolution. Persevere in your labours for I entertain and cherish  the brightest hopes for the future awakening of promising New-Zealand. I  shall ever remember the memorable visit of the first New-Zealand believers  to the Holy Land. Please assure them of my undying affection._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (11) August 12th, 1926      My dear Spiritual Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  June 7, 1926. It was most interesting to go over your circular letter and  read the many points of interest. I was especially struck by the  literature you have sent to Lord and Lady Allenby. If they have at all  seen them I am sure they were much impressed, for they knew the Master so  well. They were surely very astonished to see a group of Baha'is formed in  such a distant land.    I am very ashamed of myself not to have yet answered your letter of some  months ago. It was mainly because Shoghi Effendi wrote you and  acknowledged the receipt of your contribution for the pilgrim house that I  have been so neglectful. I took Miss Baker's advice on the matter and  together we went down-town and bought a set of straw chairs. We thought  that would be most appreciated by the friends while sitting in the veranda  of the new Pilgrim House.    I remember a prayer, which you wrote, has been asked by a certain friend  to be read daily. I believe sometimes the friends through their zeal and  ardour do things that are not asked in the Cause. We have only one prayer  that we have to say daily. No one in the world has the power, given to him  by Baha'u'llah to add another to that daily prayer. If we should admit  this the life of the friends will soon be spent in mere prayer, which is  not the aim of the Cause. The healing prayer and such ones are only for  occasional use when the need arises.    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to extend to you his hearty greetings and assure  you of his prayers.    Yours in His Name,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear fellow-worker:_    _Your letters are always a source of inspiring joy and stimulating  encouragement to me. You are destined to achieve great things for our  beloved Cause and my constant prayer is that your vision may be clear,  your purpose unshaken, your zeal undiminished, your hopes undimmed. Let  not obstacles and disappointments, which are inevitable, dishearten you  and whenever you are faced with trials recall our Beloved's innumerable  sufferings. You certainly occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (12) August 25th, 1926      Dear Spiritual Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  June 14th 1926, and also thank, through you, the Auckland friends for  their kind contribution.    He wishes me to assure you and them of his earnest prayers. He hopes that  through your constant endeavours the Cause will progress rapidly in that  city and make the spirit of the movement permeate throughout the land.  Though your number is still comparatively small yet through divine  guidance and the Master's ever wakeful spirit you will soon add many to  your group and make of it a power for goodness which will attract all  attention.    With best wishes and kindest greetings I remain,    Yours ever sincerely,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear fellow-worker:_    _I am touched by this expression of the loyalty and devotion of the  Auckland Baha'is whose welfare, and spiritual advancement are the object  of my earnest and constant prayer. I shall devote it to further the  interests of the Cause in ways that are dearest and nearest to my heart. I  shall supplicate the Almighty that strength and wisdom may be given you to  face and overcome the obstacles and trials that you will inevitably  encounter in future. The end is glorious if we only persevere._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (13) September 18th, 1926      Dear Spiritual Brother:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  July 18, 1926. He was very glad to learn of the encouraging prospects you  have for your \"Herald of the South\". He hopes that it will daily progress  and add to its importance in drawing the attention of the people there. A  good periodical fully representative of the spirit and teachings of the  Cause is the greatest help the Movement can have in establishing itself in  a country. So though difficulties may be found at the outset, we should  bear them patiently and await that the future should give us our reward.    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to extend to you his loving greetings and assure  you, as well as your mother and Mr Brewer, of his constant prayers. He  hopes that through your combined efforts the Herald of the South will soon  realise its aim and purpose.    Yours in His Service,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear and precious co-worker:_    _Your welcome letter has cheered my heart and I look forward with  confidence and joy to the harvest which you are destined to reap in the  not distant future. I shall be so pleased and grateful if you would send  me regularly a copy of your Baha'i periodical which I trust and pray will  grow from strength to strength and contribute its destined share to the  progress and consolidation of the Cause of God. Be assured of my prayers  for your happiness, welfare and spiritual advancement._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (14) October 23rd, 1926      Dear Spiritual Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  11-9-26. He was most gratified to learn that the Cause is becoming more  and more known and appreciated by the people in New Zealand. This is as  important as the actual increase of the number of the friends, for it  means that the principles are gradually permeating the thoughts of the  people and making them more ready and receptive to the full identification  of their beliefs with the precepts of the Cause.    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers for you as well as  for the other friends in New Zealand. He hopes that they will increase  both in number as well as in spiritual understanding and insight. The  reports that we occasionally receive from there are most encouraging and  hopeful. It seems that the people there due to their breadth of mind and  lack of traditional draw-backs show better prospect than many other  places.    With deepest loving greetings,    Yours in His Name,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear co-worker:_    _Your letter rejoiced my heart. I request you to persevere and renew your  splendid efforts for the consolidation of the work already achieved. I  have great hopes in the 'Herald of the South' and trust that the Editor  will be guided and strengthened in his noble undertaking. I shall be  obliged if you send me copies of any newspapers that may publish anything  on the Cause as I am preparing a collection of them in the Holy Land.  Please assure the friends in New-Zealand of my continued prayers at the  holy Shrines for the success of their pioneer work._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (15) November 3rd, 1926      Dear Spiritual Sister:    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  September 13th 1926. He was most gratified to read the nice and  encouraging news it contained.[+E5] He hopes that the \"Herald of the  South\" will daily increase in importance and now that it is coming out in  printed form, obtain a great number of readers. You should try from the  very start to maintain a high standard for its articles. They should be  broad in view, clear in style and scholarly in their development of the  different subjects. In short the 'public' should be taught to consider it  as a paper fully worthwhile to read and meditate upon. Shoghi Effendi will  remember in his prayers all those who are working in this noble field of  service.    Shoghi Effendi desires that you should extend his loving greetings to all  the friends in Auckland. He hopes that through their endeavours and the  Master's invisible guiding hand they will succeed to raise the standard of  the Cause in that land to such heights that it will arouse the interest of  all the seeking souls and in due time win their support.    The members of the Master's family are well and send you their loving  greetings.    Yours in His Service,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear co-worker:_    _I shall pray from all my heart for the steady development and the growing  influence of the \"Herald of the South\".

PART TWO: LETTERS FROM SHOGHI EFFENDI  GUARDIAN OF THE BAHA'I CAUSE  JANUARY 21, 1922-JULY 17, 1932          Letter of January 21st, 1922.      Dearly beloved brethren and sisters in 'Abdu'l-Baha:    At this early hour when the morning light is just breaking upon the Holy  Land, whilst the gloom of the dear Master's bereavement is still hanging  thick upon the hearts, I feel as if my soul turns in yearning love and  full of hope to that great company of His loved ones across the seas, who  now share with us all the agonies of His separation.    It is idle for me to emphasize how much the sorrowful ladies of the Holy  Household look forward to the work that lies before the friends in the  American continent, who in the past have rendered so glorious a service to  His Cause and will now, faithful to His special love for them, carry on  their mission still more gloriously than ever before. True, the shock has  been too terrible and sudden for us all to recover from in so short a  time, but whenever we recall His Sayings and read His Writings, hope  springs in our hearts and gives us the peace that no other material  comfort can give.    How well I remember when, more than two years ago, the Beloved Master  turning to a distinguished visitor of His, who was seated by Him in His  garden, suddenly broke the silence and said:--\"My work is now done upon  this plane; it is time for me to pass on to the other world.\" Did He not  in more than one occasion state clearly and emphatically:--\"Were ye to know  what will come to pass after me, surely would ye pray that my end be  hastened?\" In a Tablet sent to Persia when the storm raised years ago by  that Committee of Investigation was fiercely raging around Him, when the  days of His incarceration were at their blackest, He reveals the  following:--\"Now in this world of being, the Hand of Divine Power hath  firmly laid the foundations of this all-highest Bounty and this wondrous  Gift. Gradually whatsoever is latent in the innermost of this Holy Cycle  shall appear and be made manifest, for now is but the beginning of its  growth and the dayspring of the revelation of its Signs. Ere the close of  this Century and of this Age, it shall be made clear and manifest how  wondrous was that Springtide and how heavenly was that Gift!\"    With such assuring Utterances and the unmistakable evidences of His sure  and clear knowledge that His end was nigh, is there any reason why the  followers of His Faith, the world over, should be perturbed? Are not the  prayers He revealed for us sufficient source of inspiration to every  worker in His Cause? Have not His instructions paved before us the broad  and straight Path of Teaching? Will not His now doubly effective power of  Grace sustain us, strengthen us and confirm us in our work for Him? Ours  is the duty to strive by day and night to fulfill our own obligations and  then trust in His Guidance and never failing Grace. Unity amongst the  friends, selflessness in our labors in His Path, detachment from all  worldly things, the greatest prudence and caution in every step we take,  earnest endeavor to carry out only what is His Holy Will and Pleasure, the  constant awareness of His Presence and of the example of His Life, the  absolute shunning of whomsoever we feel to be an enemy of the Cause ...  these, and foremost among them is the need for unity, appear to me as our  most vital duties, should we dedicate our lives for His service. Should we  in this spirit arise to serve Him, what surer and greater promise have we  than the one His Glorious Father, Baha'u'llah, gives us in His Most Holy  Book:--\"Verily, We behold you from Our Realm of Effulgent Glory, and shall  graciously aid whosoever ariseth for the triumph of Our Cause with the  hosts of the Celestial Concourse and a company of Our chosen angels.\"    How dearly all the Holy Leaves(1) cherish that memory of the departed  Master, as He commented upon the fresh tidings that poured in from that  continent, admiring the untiring activity of the friends, the complete  subordination of their material interests to those of the Cause, the  remarkable spread of the Movement in their midst and their staunch  firmness in the Covenant of Baha'u'llah. It is these encouraging  reflections of the Master about His loved ones in America and the tests  intellectual rather than physical which He said He would send to them to  purify them and make ever brighter than before--it is these comments and  promises of His that make of the Movement in that land such a potential  force in the world today. The Beloved Master's cable to the friends in  that region is a clear indication of the presence of those counteracting  forces that may usher in those storms of tests that the Master Himself has  said will ultimately be for the good of the Cause in that land.    And finally, the ladies of the Sacred Household and we, the rest of His  kindred and family, will pray at His Hallowed Shrine for every one of you  and He will surely watch over and enhance in the course of time that noble  part of His heritage that He has bequeathed to His friends in the Far  West; friends from whom in return He expects so much and whom He has loved  and still doth love so dearly.    Your sincere co-worker in His Cause,  SHOGHI.    Haifa, Palestine.  January 21st, 1922.          Letter of March 5, 1922.      Dear fellow-workers in the Cause of Baha'u'llah:--    It is with words of regret and disappointment that I desire to open this  letter because of my inability, in view of my manifold and pressing  duties, to respond individually and in writing to the many messages of  love and sympathy and of hope that you have so affectionately sent me  since our Beloved's passing from this World. I am sure I am voicing the  sentiments of the bereaved ladies of the Household when I say that however  desirous we may be to correspond separately with every one of you, the  grave responsibilities and manifold duties now devolved upon us make it  regrettably impossible to express in written messages to every friend what  we constantly feel in our hearts, and pray for when visiting His sacred  Shrine.    At this grave and momentous period through which the Cause of God in  conformity with the Divine Wisdom is passing, it is the sacred duty of  every one of us to endeavor to realize the full significance of this Hour  of Transition, and then to make a supreme resolve to arise steadfastly for  the fulfilment of our sacred obligations.          The Mission of the Cause      Great as is the love and paternal care which our beloved Master is  extending to us from on High, and unique as is the Spirit that animates  today His servants in the world, yet a great deal will depend upon the  character and efforts of His loved ones on whom now rests the  responsibility of carrying on His work gloriously after Him. How great is  the need at this moment when the promised outpourings of His grace are  ready to be extended to every soul, for us all to form a broad vision of  the mission of the Cause to mankind, and to do all in our power to spread  it throughout the world! The eyes of the world, now that the sublime  Personality of the Master has been removed from this visible plane, are  turned with eager anticipation to us who are named after His name, and on  whom rests primarily the responsibility to keep burning the torch that He  has lit in this world. How keenly I feel at this challenging hour in the  history of the Cause the need for a firm and definite determination to  subordinate all our personal likings, our local interests, to the  interests and requirements of the Cause of God! Now is the time to set  aside, nay, to forget altogether, minor considerations regarding our  internal relationships, and to present a solid united front to the world  animated by no other desire but to serve and propagate His Cause.    It is my firm conviction which I now express with all sincerity and  candor, that the dignity and unity of the Cause urgently  demands--particularly throughout the American continent--that the friends  should in their words and conduct emphasize and give absolute prominence  to the constructive dynamic principles of Baha'u'llah, rather than attach  undue importance to His negative Teachings. With hearts cleansed from the  least trace of suspicion and filled with hope and faith in what the spirit  of love can achieve, we must one and all endeavor at this moment to forget  past impressions, and with absolute good-will and genuine cooperation  unite in deepening and diffusing the spirit of love and service that the  Cause has thus far so remarkably shown to the world. To this attitude of  good-will, of forbearance and genuine kindness to all, must be added,  however, constant but unprovocative vigilance, lest unrestricted  association with the peoples of the world should enable the very few who  have been definitely pronounced by the Master as injurious to the body of  the Cause, to make a breach in the Movement. Not until, however, an  unmistakable evidence should appear, manifestly revealing the evil motives  of a certain individual or group of individuals, is it advisable to make  the matter"]]]
