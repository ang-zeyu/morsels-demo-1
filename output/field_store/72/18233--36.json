He would be wiser, however, did he seize one of the  occasions when the people have taken up arms for him to destroy all  those who make sedition; and to free the country, once and for all,  from the trouble.    \"Sedition should be always nipped in the bud. Lenity, in such a  case, is the most cruel course; for it encourages men to think that  those in authority fear them, and that they can conspire without  danger; and whereas, at first, the blood of ten men will put an end  to sedition, it needs, at last, the blood of as many thousands to  restore peace and order. It is good for a man to be merciful, but  not for a ruler, for the good of the whole people is placed in his  hands. The sword of justice is given to him, and he is most  merciful who uses it the most promptly against those who work  sedition. The wise ruler will listen to the prayers of his people,  and will grant their petitions, when they show that their case is  hard; but he will grant nothing to him who asketh with his sword in  his hand, for he knows full well that when he yields, once, he must  yield always; until the time comes, as come it surely will, when he  must resist with the sword. Then the land will be filled with blood  whereas, in the beginning, he could have avoided all trouble, by  refusing so much as to listen to those who spoke with threats.    \"Josephus is a good man, and the Lord has given him great gifts. He  has done great things for the land; but you will see that many woes  will come, and much blood will be shed, from this lenity of his  towards those who stir up tumults among the people.\"    A few minutes later the family retired to bed; the hour being a  late one for Simon's household, which generally retired to rest a  short time after the evening meal.    The next day the work of gathering in the figs was carried on,  earnestly and steadily, with the aid of the workers whom Simon had  hired in the town and, in two days, the trees were all stripped,  and strings of figs hung to dry from the boughs of all the trees  round the house.    Then the gathering of the grapes began. All the inhabitants of the  little fishing village lent their aid--men as well as women and  children--for the vintage was looked upon as a holiday; and Simon  was regarded as a good friend by his neighbors, being ever ready to  aid them when there was need, judging any disputes which arose  between them, and lending them money without interest if misfortune  came upon their boats or nets, or if illness befell them; while the  women, in times of sickness or trouble, went naturally to Martha  with their griefs, and were assured of sympathy, good advice, and  any drugs or dainty food suited to the case.    The women and girls picked the grapes, and laid them in baskets.  These were carried by men, and emptied into the vat; where other  men trod them down, and pressed out the juice. Martha and her maids  saw to the cooking and laying out, on the great tables in the  courtyard, of the meals; to which all sat down, together. Simon  superintended the crushing of the grapes; and John worked now at  one task, and now at another. It was a pretty scene, and rendered  more gay by the songs of the women and girls, as they worked; and  the burst of merry laughter which, at times, arose.    It lasted four days, by which time the last bunch, save those on a  few vines preserved for eating, was picked and crushed; and the  vats in the cellar, sunk underground for coolness, were full to the  brim. Simon was much pleased with the result; and declared that  never, in his memory, had the vine and fig harvest turned out more  abundant. The corn had long before been gathered, and there  remained now only the olives; but it would be some little time yet  before these were fit to be gathered, and their oil extracted, for  they were allowed to hang on the trees until ready to drop.    The last basket of grapes was brought in with much ceremony; the  gatherers forming a little procession, and singing a thanksgiving  hymn as they walked. The evening meal was more bounteous, even,  than usual; and all who helped carried away with them substantial  proofs of Simon's thankfulness, and satisfaction.    For the next few days Simon and his men, and Martha's maids, lent  their assistance in getting in the vintage of their neighbors; for  each family had its patch of ground, and grew sufficient grapes and  fruits for its own needs. Those in the village brought their grapes  to a vat, which they had in common; the measures of the grapes  being counted as they were put in, and the wine afterwards divided,  in like proportion--for wine, to be good, must be made in  considerable quantities.    And now there was, for a time, little to do on the farm. Simon  superintended the men who were plowing up the corn stubbles, ready  for the sowing in the spring; sometimes putting his hand to the  plow, and driving the oxen. Isaac and his son worked in the  vineyard and garden, near the house; aided to some extent by John  who, however, was not yet called upon to take a man's share in the  work of the farm--he having but lately finished his learning, with  the rabbi, at the school in Hippos. Still, he worked steadily every  morning and, in the afternoon, generally went out on the lake with  the fishermen, with whom he was a great favorite.    This was not to last long for, at seventeen, he was to join his  father, regularly, in the management of the farm and, indeed, the  Rabbi Solomon, who was a frequent guest, was of opinion that Simon  gave the boy too much license; and that he ought, already, to be  doing man's work.    But Simon, when urged by him, said:    \"I know that, at his age, I was working hard, rabbi; but the lad  has studied diligently, and I have a good report of him; and I  think it well that, at his age, the bow should be unbent somewhat.    \"Besides, who knows what is before us! I will let the lad have as  much pleasure from his life as he can. The storm is approaching;  let him play, while the sun shines.\"        Chapter 2: A Storm On Galilee.      One day, after the midday meal, John said:    \"Mary, Raphael and his brother have taken the big boat, and gone  off with fish to Tiberias; and have told me that I can take the  small boat, if I will. Ask my mother to let you off your task, and  come out with me. It is a fortnight since we had a row on the lake,  together.\"    \"I was beginning to think that you were never going to ask me  again, John; and, only I should punish myself, I would say you nay.  There have you been, going out fishing every afternoon, and leaving  me at home to spin; and it is all the worse because your mother has  said that the time is fast coming when I must give up wandering  about like a child, and must behave myself like a woman.    \"Oh, dear, how tiresome it will be when there will be nothing to do  but to sit and spin, and to look after the house, and to walk  instead of running when I am out, and to behave like a grown-up  person, altogether!\"    \"You are almost grown up,\" John said; \"you are taller, now, than  any of the maids except Zillah; but I shall be sorry to see you  growing staid and solemn. And it was selfish of me not to ask you  to go out before, but I really did not think of it. The fishermen  have been working hard, to make up for the time lost during the  harvest; and I have really been useful, helping them with their  nets, and this is the last year I shall have my liberty.    \"But come, don't let's be wasting time in talking; run in and get  my mother's permission, and then join me on the shore. I will take  some grapes down, for you to eat; for the sun is hot today, and  there is scarce a breath of wind on the water.\"    A few minutes later, the young pair stood together by the side of  the boat.    \"Your mother made all sorts of objections,\" Mary said, laughing,  \"and I do think she won't let me come again. I don't think she  would have done it, today, if Miriam had not stood up for me, and  said that I was but a child though I was so tall; and that, as you  were very soon going to work with your father, she thought that it  was no use in making the change before that.\"    \"What nonsense it all is!\" John said. \"Besides, you know it is  arranged that, in a few months, we are to be betrothed according to  the wishes of your parents and mine. It would have been done, long  ago, only my father and mother do not approve of young betrothals;  and think it better to wait, to see if the young ones like each  other; and I think that is quite right, too, in most cases--only,  of course, living here, as you have done for the last three  years--since your father and mother died--there was no fear of our  not liking each other.\"    \"Well, you see,\" Mary said, as she sat in the stern of the boat,  while John rowed it quietly along, \"it might have been just the  other way. When people don't see anything of each other, till they  are betrothed by their parents, they can't dislike each other very  much; whereas, when they get to know each other, if they are  disagreeable they might get to almost hate each other.\"    \"Yes, there is something in that,\" John agreed. \"Of course, in our  case it is all right, because we do like each other--we couldn't  have liked each other more, I think, if we had been brother and  sister--but it seems to me that, sometimes, it must be horrid when  a boy is told by his parents that he is to be betrothed to a girl  he has never seen. You see it isn't as if it were for a short time,  but for all one's life. It must be awful!\"    \"Awful!\" Mary agreed, heartily; \"but of course, it would have to be  done.\"    \"Of course,\" John said--the possibility of a lad refusing to obey  his parents' commands not even occurring to him. \"Still it doesn't  seem to me quite right that one should have no choice, in so  important a matter.

The moment that the name of the youthful author of the \"Abuse of Satire\"  had transpired, Peter Pindar, faithful to the instinct of his nature,  wrote a letter of congratulation and compliment to his assailant, and  desired to make his acquaintance. The invitation was responded to, and  until the death of Wolcot, they were intimate. My father always  described Wolcot as a warm-hearted man; coarse in his manners, and  rather rough, but eager to serve those whom he liked, of which, indeed,  I might appropriately mention an instance.    It so happened, that about the year 1795, when he was in his 29th year  there came over my father that mysterious illness to which the youth of  men of sensibility, and especially literary men, is frequently  subject--a failing of nervous energy, occasioned by study and too  sedentary habits, early and habitual reverie, restless and indefinite  purpose. The symptoms, physical and moral, are most distressing:  lassitude and despondency. And it usually happens, as in the present  instance, that the cause of suffering is not recognised; and that  medical men, misled by the superficial symptoms, and not seeking to  acquaint themselves with the psychology of their patients, arrive at  erroneous, often fatal, conclusions. In this case, the most eminent of  the faculty gave it as their opinion, that the disease was consumption.  Dr. Turton, if I recollect right, was then the most considered physician  of the day. An immediate visit to a warmer climate was his specific; and  as the Continent was then disturbed and foreign residence out of the  question, Dr. Turton recommended that his patient should establish  himself without delay in Devonshire.    When my father communicated this impending change in his life to Wolcot,  the modern Skelton shook his head. He did not believe that his friend  was in a consumption, but being a Devonshire man, and loving very much  his native province, he highly approved of the remedy. He gave my father  several letters of introduction to persons of consideration at Exeter;  among others, one whom he justly described as a poet and a physician,  and the best of men, the late Dr. Hugh Downman. Provincial cities very  often enjoy a transient term of intellectual distinction. An eminent man  often collects around him congenial spirits, and the power of  association sometimes produces distant effects which even an individual,  however gifted, could scarcely have anticipated. A combination of  circumstances had made at this time Exeter a literary metropolis. A  number of distinguished men flourished there at the same moment: some of  their names are even now remembered. Jackson of Exeter still survives as  a native composer of original genius. He was also an author of high  aesthetical speculation. The heroic poems of Hole are forgotten, but his  essay on the Arabian Nights is still a cherished volume of elegant and  learned criticism. Hayter was the classic antiquary who first discovered  the art of unrolling the MSS. of Herculaneum. There were many others,  noisier and more bustling, who are now forgotten, though they in some  degree influenced the literary opinion of their time. It was said, and I  believe truly, that the two principal, if not sole, organs of periodical  criticism at that time, I think the \"Critical Review\" and the \"Monthly  Review,\" were principally supported by Exeter contributions. No doubt  this circumstance may account for a great deal of mutual praise and  sympathetic opinion on literary subjects, which, by a convenient  arrangement, appeared in the pages of publications otherwise professing  contrary opinions on all others. Exeter had then even a learned society  which published its Transactions.    With such companions, by whom he was received with a kindness and  hospitality which to the last he often dwelt on, it may easily be  supposed that the banishment of my father from the delights of literary  London was not as productive a source of gloom as the exile of Ovid to  the savage Pontus, even if it had not been his happy fortune to have  been received on terms of intimate friendship by the accomplished family  of Mr. Baring, who was then member for Exeter, and beneath whose roof he  passed a great portion of the period of nearly three years during which  he remained in Devonshire.    The illness of my father was relieved, but not removed, by this change  of life. Dr. Downman was his physician, whose only remedies were port  wine, horse-exercise, rowing on the neighbouring river, and the  distraction of agreeable society. This wise physician recognised the  temperament of his patient, and perceived that his physical derangement  was an effect instead of a cause. My father instead of being in a  consumption, was endowed with a frame of almost super-human strength,  and which was destined for half a century of continuous labour and  sedentary life. The vital principle in him, indeed, was so strong that  when he left us at eighty-two, it was only as the victim of a violent  epidemic, against whose virulence he struggled with so much power, that  it was clear, but for this casualty, he might have been spared to this  world even for several years.    I should think that this illness of his youth, and which, though of a  fitful character, was of many years' duration, arose from his inability  to direct to a satisfactory end the intellectual power which he was  conscious of possessing. He would mention the ten years of his life,  from twenty-five to thirty-five years of age, as a period very deficient  in self-contentedness. The fact is, with a poetic temperament, he had  been born in an age when the poetic faith of which he was a votary had  fallen into decrepitude, and had become only a form with the public, not  yet gifted with sufficient fervour to discover a new creed. He was a  pupil of Pope and Boileau, yet both from his native impulse and from the  glowing influence of Rousseau, he felt the necessity and desire of  infusing into the verse of the day more passion than might resound from  the frigid lyre of Mr. Hayley. My father had fancy, sensibility, and an  exquisite taste, but he had not that rare creative power, which the  blended and simultaneous influence of the individual organisation and  the spirit of the age, reciprocally acting upon each other, can alone,  perhaps, perfectly develope; the absence of which, at periods of  transition, is so universally recognised and deplored, and yet which  always, when it does arrive, captivates us, as it were, by surprise. How  much there was of freshness, and fancy, and natural pathos in his mind,  may be discerned in his Persian romance of \"The Loves of Mejnoon and  Leila.\" We who have been accustomed to the great poets of the nineteenth  century seeking their best inspiration in the climate and manners of the  East; who are familiar with the land of the Sun from the isles of Ionia  to the vales of Cashmere; can scarcely appreciate the literary  originality of a writer who, fifty years ago, dared to devise a real  Eastern story, and seeking inspiration in the pages of Oriental  literature, compose it with reference to the Eastern mind, and customs,  and landscape. One must have been familiar with the Almorans and Hamets,  the Visions of Mirza and the kings of Ethiopia, and the other dull and  monstrous masquerades of Orientalism then prevalent, to estimate such an  enterprise, in which, however, one should not forget the author had the  advantage of the guiding friendship of that distinguished Orientalist,  Sir William Ouseley. The reception of this work by the public, and of  other works of fiction which its author gave to them anonymously, was in  every respect encouraging, and their success may impartially be  registered as fairly proportionate to their merits; but it was not a  success, or a proof of power, which, in my father's opinion, compensated  for that life of literary research and study which their composition  disturbed and enfeebled. It was at the ripe age of five-and-thirty that  he renounced his dreams of being an author, and resolved to devote  himself for the rest of his life to the acquisition of knowledge.    When my father, many years afterwards, made the acquaintance of Sir  Walter Scott, the great poet saluted him by reciting a poem of  half-a-dozen stanzas which my father had written in his early youth. Not  altogether without agitation, surprise was expressed that these lines  should have been known, still more that they should have been  remembered. \"Ah!\" said Sir Walter, \"if the writer of these lines had  gone on, he would have been an English poet.\"[2]    It is possible; it is even probable that, if my father had devoted  himself to the art, he might have become the author of some elegant and  popular didactic poem, on some ordinary subject, which his fancy would  have adorned with grace and his sensibility invested with sentiment;  some small volume which might have reposed with a classic title upon our  library shelves, and served as a prize volume at Ladies' Schools. This  celebrity was not reserved for him: instead of this he was destined to  give to his country a series of works illustrative of its literary and  political history, full of new information and new views, which time  and opinion has ratified as just. But the poetical temperament was not  thrown away upon him; it never is on any one; it was this great gift  which prevented his being a mere literary antiquary; it was this which  animated his page with picture and his narrative with interesting  vivacity; above all, it was this temperament, which invested him with  that sympathy with his subject, which made him the most delightful  biographer in our language. In a word, it was because he was a poet,"]]]
