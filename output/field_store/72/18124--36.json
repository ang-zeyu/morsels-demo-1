Now my little heart goes a-beating like a drum,          With the breath of Bogie in my hair,      And all round the candle the crooked shadows come,          And go marching along up the stair.        The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp,          The shadow of the child that goes to bed--      All the wicked shadows coming, tramp, tramp, tramp,          With the black night overhead.    [Illustration]          WINTER-TIME          Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,      A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;      Blinks but an hour or two; and then,      A blood-red orange, sets again.        Before the stars have left the skies,      At morning in the dark I rise;      And shivering in my nakedness,      By the cold candle, bathe and dress.        Close by the jolly fire I sit      To warm my frozen bones a bit;      Or with a reindeer-sled, explore      The colder countries round the door.        When to go out, my nurse doth wrap      Me in my comforter and cap;      The cold wind burns my face and blows      Its frosty pepper up my nose.        Black are my steps on silver sod;      Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;      And tree and house, and hill and lake,      Are frosted like a wedding-cake.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE LITTLE LAND          When at home alone I sit      And am very tired of it,      I have just to shut my eyes      To go sailing through the skies--      To go sailing far away      To the pleasant Land of play;      To the fairy land afar      Where the Little People are;      Where the clover-tops are trees,      And the rain-pools are the seas,      And the leaves like little ships      Sail about on tiny trips;      And above the daisy tree          Through the grasses,      High o'erhead the Bumble Bee          Hums and passes.        In that forest to and fro      I can wander, I can go;      See the spider and the fly,      And the ants go marching by      Carrying parcels with their feet      Down the green and grassy street.      I can in the sorrel sit      Where the ladybird alit.      I can climb the jointed grass;          And on high      See the greater swallows pass          In the sky,      And the round sun rolling by      Heeding no such things as I.        Through that forest I can pass      Till, as in a looking-glass,      Humming fly and daisy tree      And my tiny self I see,      Painted very clear and neat      On the rain-pool at my feet.        Should a leaflet come to land      Drifting near to where I stand,      Straight I'll board that tiny boat      Round the rain-pool sea to float.        Little thoughtful creatures sit      On the grassy coasts of it;      Little things with lovely eyes      See me sailing with surprise.      Some are clad in armour green--      (These have sure to battle been!)--      Some are pied with ev'ry hue,      Black and crimson, gold and blue;      Some have wings and swift are gone;      But they all look kindly on.        When my eyes I once again      Open, and see all things plain;      High bare walls, great bare floor;      Great big knobs on drawer and door;      Great big people perched on chairs,      Stitching tucks and mending tears,      Each a hill that I could climb,      And talking nonsense all the time--         O dear me,         That I could be      A sailor on the rain-pool sea,      A climber in, the clover tree,      And just come back, a sleepy-head,      Late at night to go to bed.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          IN PORT          Last, to the chamber where I lie      My fearful footsteps patter nigh,      And come from out the cold and gloom      Into my warm and cheerful room.        There, safe arrived, we turn about      To keep the coming shadows out,      And close the happy door at last      On all the perils that we passed.        Then, when mamma goes by to bed,      She shall come in with tip-toe tread,      And see me lying warm and fast      And in the Land of Nod at last.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          NIGHT AND DAY          When the golden day is done,        Through the closing portal,      Child and garden, flower and sun,        Vanish all things mortal.        As the blinding showers fall,        As the rays diminish,      Under evening's cloak they all        Roll away and vanish.        Garden darkened, daisy shut,        Child in bed, they slumber--      Glow-worm in the highway rut,        Mice among the lumber.        In the darkness houses shine,          Parents move with candles      Till on all, the night divine          Turns the bedroom handles.        Till at last the day begins          In the east a-breaking,      In the hedges and the whins          Sleeping birds a-waking.        In the darkness shapes of things,          Houses, trees and hedges,      Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings          Beat on window ledges.        These shall wake the yawning maid,          She the door shall open--      Finding dew on garden glade          And the morning broken.        There my garden grows again          Green and rosy painted,      As at eve behind the pane          From my eyes it fainted.        Just as it was shut away,          Toy-like, in the even,      Here I see it glow with day          Under glowing heaven.        Every path and every plot,          Every bush of roses,      Every blue forget-me-not          Where the dew reposes.        'Up! they cry, 'the day is come          On the smiling valleys;      We have beat the morning drum;          Playmate, join your allies!'    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          NEST EGGS          Birds all the sunny day        Flutter and quarrel      Here in the arbor-like        Tent of the laurel.        Here in the fork        The brown nest is seated;      Four little blue eggs        The mother keeps heated.        While we stand watching her,        Staring like gabies,      Safe in each egg are the        Bird's little babies.        Soon the frail eggs they shall        Chip, and upspringing      Make all the April woods        Merry with singing.        Younger than we are,        O children, and frailer,      Soon in blue air they'll be,        Singer and sailor.        We, so much older,        Taller and stronger,      We shall look down on the        Birdies no longer.        They shall go flying        With musical speeches      High over head in the        Tops of the beeches.        In spite of our wisdom        And sensible talking,      We on our feet must go        Plodding and walking.    [Illustration]          THE FLOWERS          All the names I know from nurse:      Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,      Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,      And the Lady Hollyhock.        Fairy places, fairy things,      Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,      Tiny trees for tiny dames--      These must all be fairy names!        Tiny woods below whose boughs      Shady fairies weave a house;      Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,      Where the braver fairies climb!        Fair are grown-up people's trees,      But the fairest woods are these;      Where if I were not so tall,      I should live for good and all.    [Illustration]          FROM A RAILWAY CARRIAGE          Faster than fairies, faster than witches,      Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;      And charging along like troops in a battle,      All through the meadows the horses and cattle:      All of the sights of the hill and the plain      Fly as thick as driving rain;      And ever again in the wink of an eye,      Painted stations whistle by.        Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,      All by himself and gathering brambles;      Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;      And there is the green for stringing the daisies!      Here is a cart run away in the road      Lumping along with man and load;      And here is a mill and there is a river,      Each a glimpse and gone forever!    [Illustration]          MY TREASURES          These nuts, that I keep in the back of the nest      Where all my lead soldiers are lying at rest,      Were gathered in autumn by nursie and me      In a wood with a well by the side of the sea.        This whistle we made (and how clearly it sounds!)      By the side of a field at the end of the grounds.      Of a branch of a plane, with a knife of my own,      It was nursie who made it, and nursie alone!        The stone, with the white and the yellow and grey,      We discovered I cannot tell _how_ far away;      And I carried it back although weary and cold,      For though father denies it, I'm sure it is gold.        But of all of my treasures the last is the king,      For there's very few children possess such a thing;      And that is a chisel, both handle and blade,      Which a man who was really a carpenter made.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          BLOCK CITY          What are you able to build with your blocks?      Castles and palaces, temples and docks.      Rain may keep raining and others go roam,      But I can be happy and building at home.        Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,      There I'll establish a city for me:      A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,      And a harbor as well where my vessels may ride.        Great is the palace with pillar and wall,      A sort of a tower on the top of it all,      And steps coming down in an orderly way      To where my toy vessels lay safe in the bay.        This one is sailing and that one is moored:      Hark to the song of the sailors on board!      And see the steps of my palace, the kings      Coming and going with presents and things!        Now I have done with it, down let it go!      All in a moment the town is laid low.      Block upon block lying scattered and free,      What is there left of my town by the sea?        Yet as I saw it, I see "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19723"],[0,"The Cliff Ruins of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona (#4)"],[1," upper part of that river; Fort Defiance is but half a day's journey to  the southeast; Tusayan and Zuni are but three days distant to the  traveler on foot; the Navaho often ride the distance in a day or a day  and a half. The canyon is accessible to wagons, however, only at its  mouth.    The main canyon, shown on the map (plate XLII) as Canyon de Chelly and  known to the Navaho as Tse-gi, is about 20 miles long. It heads near  Washington pass, within a few miles of the crest of the mountain, and  extends almost due west to the Chin Lee valley. The country descends by  a regular slope from an altitude of about 7,500 feet at the foot of the  main crest to about 5,200 feet in the Chin Lee valley, 25 miles west,  and is so much cut up locally by ravines and washes that it is  impassable to wagons, but it preserves throughout its mesa-like  character.    About 3 miles from its mouth De Chelly is joined by another canyon  almost as long, which, heading also in the Tunicha mountains, comes in  from the northeast. It is over 15 miles long, and is called on the map  Canyon del Muerto; the Navaho know it as En-a-tse-gi. About 13 miles  above the mouth of the main canyon a small branch comes in from the  southeast. It is about 10 miles long, and has been called Monument  canyon, on account of the number of upright natural pinnacles of rock in  it. In addition to those named there are innumerable small branches,  ranging in size from deep coves to real canyons a mile or two long.  Outside of De Chelly, and independent of it, there is a little canyon  about 4 miles long, called Tse-on-i-tso-si by the Navaho. At one point  near its head it approaches so near to De Chelly that but a few feet of  rock separate them.    On the western side of the mountains there are a number of small  perennial streams fed by springs on the upper slopes. Several of these  meet in the upper part of De Chelly, others in Del Muerto, and in the  upper parts of these canyons there is generally water. But, except at  the time of the autumn and winter rains and in the spring when the  mountain snows are melting, the streams are not powerful enough to carry  the water to the mouth of the canyon. The flow is absorbed by the deep  sand which forms the stream bed. Ordinarily it is difficult to procure  enough water to drink less than 8 or 10 miles from the mouth of De  Chelly, but occasionally the whole stream bed, at places over a quarter  of a mile wide, is occupied by a raging torrent impassable to man or  beast. Such ebullitions, however, seldom last more than a few hours.  Usually water can be obtained anywhere in the bottom by sinking a  shallow well in the sand, and it is by this method that the Navaho, the  present occupants of the canyon, obtain their supply.    The walls of the canyon are composed of brilliant red sandstone,  discolored everywhere by long streaks of black and gray coming from  above. At its mouth it is about 500 feet wide. Higher up the walls  sometimes approach to 300 feet of each other, elsewhere broadening out  to half a mile or more; but everywhere the wall line is tortuous and  crooked in the extreme, and, while the general direction of De Chelly is  east and west, the traveler on the trail which runs through it is as  often headed north or south. Del Muerto is even more tortuous than De  Chelly, and in places it is so narrow that one could almost throw a  stone across it.    At its mouth the walls of Canyon de Chelly are but 20 to 30 feet high,  descending vertically to a wide bed of loose white sand, and absolutely  free from talus or debris. Three miles above Del Muerto comes in, but  its mouth is so narrow it appears like an alcove and might easily be  overlooked. Here the walls are over 200 feet high, but the rise is so  gradual that it is impossible to appreciate its amount. At the point  where Monument canyon comes in, 13 miles above the mouth of De Chelly,  the walls reach a height of over 800 feet, about one-third of which  consists of talus.    The rise in the height of the walls is so gradual that when the canyon  is entered at its mouth the mental scale by which we estimate distances  and magnitudes is lost and the wildest conjectures result. We fail at  first to realize the stupendous scale on which the work was done, and  when we do finally realize it we swing to the opposite side and  exaggerate. At the junction of Monument canyon there is a beautiful rock  pinnacle or needle standing out clear from the cliff and not more than  165 feet on the ground. It has been named, in conjunction with a  somewhat similar pinnacle on the other side of the canyon, \"The  Captains,\" and its height has been variously estimated at from 1,200 to  2,500 feet. It is less than 800. A curious illustration of the effects  of the scenery in connection with this pinnacle may not be amiss. The  author of Western Wilds (Cincinnati, 1878) thus describes it:      But the most remarkable and unaccountable feature of the locality is    where the canyons meet. There stands out 100 feet from the point,    entirely isolated, a vast leaning rock tower at least 1,200 feet    high and not over 200 thick at the base, as if it had originally    been the sharp termination of the cliff and been broken off and    shoved farther out. It almost seems that one must be mistaken; that    it must have some connection with the cliff, until one goes around    it and finds it 100 feet or more from the former. It leans at an    angle from the perpendicular of at least 15 degrees; and lying down    at the base on the under side, by the best sighting I could make, it    seemed to me that the opposite upper edge was directly over me--that    is to say, mechanically speaking, its center of gravity barely falls    with the base, and a heave of only a yard or two more would cause it    to topple over. (Page 257.)    The dimensions have already been given. The pinnacle is perfectly plumb.    The rock of which the canyon walls are formed is a massive sandstone in  which the lines of bedding are almost completely obliterated. It is  rather soft in texture, and has been carved by atmospheric erosion into  grotesque and sometimes beautiful forms. In places great blocks have  fallen off, leaving smooth vertical surfaces, extending sometimes from  the top nearly to the stream bed, 400 feet or more in height and as much  in breadth. In the lower parts of the canyons the walls, sometimes of  the character described, sometimes with the surfaces and angles smoothed  by the flying sand, are generally vertical and often overhang,  descending sheer to the canyon bottom without talus or intervening  slopes of debris. The talus, where there is any, is slight and consists  of massive sandstone of the same character as the walls, but much  rounded by atmospheric erosion. The enlarged map (plate XLIII) shows  something of this character.    Near its mouth the whole bottom of the canyon consists of an even  stretch of white sand extending from cliff to cliff. A little higher up  there are small areas of alluvium, or bottom land, in recesses and coves  in the walls and generally only a foot or two above the stream bed.  Still higher up these areas become more abundant and of greater extent,  forming regular benches or terraces, generally well raised above the  stream bed. At the Casa Blanca ruin, 7 miles up the canyon, the bench is  8 or 10 feet above the stream. Each little branch canyon and deep cove  in the cliffs is fronted by a more or less extended area of this  cultivable bottom land. Ten miles up the talus has become a prominent  feature. It consists of broken rock, sand, and soil, generally overlying  a slope of massive sandstone, such as has been described, and which  occasionally crops out on the surface. With the development of the talus  the area of bottom land dwindles, and the former encroaches more and  more until a little above the junction of Monument canyon the bottom  land is limited to narrow strips and small patches here and there.    These bottom lands are the cultivable areas of the canyon bottom, and  their occurrence and distribution have dictated the location of the  villages now in ruins. They are also the sites of all the Navaho  settlements in the canyon. The Navaho hogans are generally placed  directly on the bottoms; the ruins are always so located as to overlook  them. Only a very small proportion of the available land is utilized by  the Navaho, and not all of it was used by the old village builders. The  Navaho sites, as a whole, are far superior to the village sites.    The horticultural conditions here, while essentially the same as those  of the whole pueblo region, present some peculiar features. Except for a  few modern examples there are no traces of irrigating works, and the  Navaho work can not be regarded as a success. The village builders  probably did not require irrigation for the successful cultivation of  their crops, and under the ordinary Indian methods of planting and  cultivation a failure to harvest a good crop was probably rare. After  the Harvest season it is the practice of the Navaho to abandon the  canyon for the winter, driving their flocks and carrying the season's  produce to more open localities in the neighboring valleys. The canyon  is not a desirable place of residence in the winter to a people who live  in the saddle and have large flocks of sheep and goats, but there is no  evidence that the old inhabitants followed the Navaho practice.    During most of the year there is no water in the lower 10 miles of the  canyons, where most of the cultivable land is situated. The autumn rains  in the mountains, which occur late in July or early in August, sometimes  send down a little stream, which, however, generally lasts but a few  days and fails to reach the mouth of the canyon. Late in October, or  early in November, a small amount comes down and is fairly permanent  through the winter and spring. The stream bed is even"]]]
