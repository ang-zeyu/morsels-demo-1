This ringing struck me as so urgent that I  ran out in my pajamas, and found there Mr. Leroux, in a very disturbed  state--\"    \"What did he say? Give his own words as nearly as you remember them.\"    Leroux, who had been standing, sank slowly back into the armchair, with  his eyes upon Dr. Cumberly as the latter replied:--    \"He said 'Cumberly! Cumberly! For God's sake, come down at once; there  is a strange woman in my flat, apparently in a dying condition!'\"    \"What did you do?\"    \"I ran into my bedroom and slipped on my dressing-gown, leaving Mr.  Leroux in the entrance-hall. Then, with the clock chiming the last  stroke of midnight, we came out together and I closed my door behind me.  There was no light on the stair; but our conversation--Mr. Leroux was  speaking in a very high-pitched voice\"...    \"What was he saying?\"    \"He was explaining to me how some woman, unknown to him, had interrupted  his work a few minutes before by ringing his door-bell.\"...    Inspector Dunbar held up his hand.    \"I won't ask you to repeat what he said, doctor; Mr. Leroux, presently,  can give me his own words.\"    \"We had descended to this floor, then,\" resumed Cumberly, \"when Mr.  Exel, entering below, called up to us, asking if anything was the  matter. Leroux replied, 'Matter, Exel! There's a devil of a business!  For mercy's sake, come up!'\"    \"Well?\"    \"Mr. Exel thereupon joined us at the door of this flat.\"    \"Was it open?\"    \"Yes. Mr. Leroux had rushed up to me, leaving the door open behind him.  The light was out, both in the lobby and in the study, a fact upon which  I commented at the time. It was all the more curious as Mr. Leroux had  left both lights on!\"...    \"Did he say so?\"    \"He did. The circumstances surprised him to a marked degree. We came in  and I turned up the light in the lobby. Then Leroux, entering the  study, turned up the light there, too. I entered next, followed by Mr.  Exel--and we saw the body lying where you see it now.\"    \"Who saw it first?\"    \"Mr. Leroux; he drew my attention to it, saying that he had left her  lying on the chesterfield and NOT upon the floor.\"    \"You examined her?\"    \"I did. She was dead, but still warm. She exhibited signs of recent  illness, and of being addicted to some drug habit; probably morphine.  This, beyond doubt, contributed to her death, but the direct cause was  asphyxiation. She had been strangled!\"    \"My God!\" groaned Leroux, dropping his face into his hands.    \"You found marks on her throat?\"    \"The marks were very slight. No great pressure was required in her weak  condition.\"    \"You did not move the body?\"    \"Certainly not; a more complete examination must be made, of course. But  I extracted a piece of torn paper from her clenched right hand.\"    Inspector Dunbar lowered his tufted brows.    \"I'm not glad to know you did that,\" he said. \"It should have been  left.\"    \"It was done on the spur of the moment, but without altering the  position of the hand or arm. The paper lies upon the table, yonder.\"    Inspector Dunbar took a long drink. Thus far he had made no attempt  to examine the victim. Pulling out a bulging note-case from the inside  pocket of his blue serge coat, he unscrewed a fountain-pen, carefully  tested the nib upon his thumb nail, and made three or four brief  entries. Then, stretching out one long arm, he laid the wallet and  the pen beside his glass upon the top of a bookcase, without otherwise  changing his position, and glancing aside at Exel, said:--    \"Now, Mr. Exel, what help can you give us?\"    \"I have little to add to Dr. Cumberly's account,\" answered Exel,  offhandedly. \"The whole thing seemed to me\"...    \"What it seemed,\" interrupted Dunbar, \"does not interest Scotland Yard,  Mr. Exel, and won't interest the jury.\"    Leroux glanced up for a moment, then set his teeth hard, so that his jaw  muscles stood out prominently under the pallid skin.    \"What do you want to know, then?\" asked Exel.    \"I will be wanting to know,\" said Dunbar, \"where you were coming from,  to-night?\"    \"From the House of Commons.\"    \"You came direct?\"    \"I left Sir Brian Malpas at the corner of Victoria Street at four  minutes to twelve by Big Ben, and walked straight home, actually  entering here, from the street, as the clock was chiming the last stroke  of midnight.\"    \"Then you would have walked up the street from an easterly direction?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Did you meet any one or anything?\"    \"A taxi-cab, empty--for the hood was lowered--passed me as I turned the  corner. There was no other vehicle in the street, and no person.\"    \"You don't know from which door the cab came?\"    \"As I turned the corner,\" replied Exel, \"I heard the man starting his  engine, although when I actually saw the cab, it was in motion; but  judging by the sound to which I refer, the cab had been stationary,  if not at the door of Palace Mansions, certainly at that of the next  block--St. Andrew's Mansions.\"    \"Did you hear, or see anything else?\"    \"I saw nothing whatever. But just as I approached the street door, I  heard a peculiar whistle, apparently proceeding from the gardens in the  center of the square. I attached no importance to it at the time.\"    \"What kind of whistle?\"    \"I have forgotten the actual notes, but the effect was very odd in some  way.\"    \"In what way?\"    \"An impression of this sort is not entirely reliable, Inspector; but it  struck me as Oriental.\"    \"Ah!\" said Dunbar, and reached out the long arm for his notebook.    \"Can I be of any further assistance?\" said Exel, glancing at his watch.    \"You had entered the hall-way and were about to enter your own flat when  the voices of Dr. Cumberly and Mr. Leroux attracted your attention?\"    \"I actually had the key in my hand,\" replied Exel.    \"Did you actually have the key in the lock?\"    \"Let me think,\" mused Exel, and he took out a bunch of keys and dangled  them, reflectively, before his eyes. \"No! I was fumbling for the right  key when I heard the voices above me.\"    \"But were you facing your door?\"    \"No,\" averred Exel, perceiving the drift of the inspector's inquiries;  \"I was facing the stairway the whole time, and although it was in  darkness, there is a street lamp immediately outside on the pavement,  and I can swear, positively, that no one descended; that there was no  one in the hall nor on the stair, except Mr. Leroux and Dr. Cumberly.\"    \"Ah!\" said Dunbar again, and made further entries in his book. \"I need  not trouble you further, sir. Good night!\"    Exel, despite his earlier attitude of boredom, now ignored this official  dismissal, and, tossing the stump of his cigar into the grate, lighted a  cigarette, and with both hands thrust deep in his pockets, stood leaning  back against the mantelpiece. The detective turned to Leroux.    \"Have a brandy-and-soda?\" suggested Dr. Cumberly, his eyes turned upon  the pathetic face of the novelist.    But Leroux shook his head, wearily.    \"Go ahead, Inspector!\" he said. \"I am anxious to tell you all I know.  God knows I am anxious to tell you.\"    A sound was heard of a key being inserted in the lock of a door.    Four pairs of curious eyes were turned toward the entrance lobby, when  the door opened, and a sleek man of medium height, clean shaven, but  with his hair cut low upon the cheek bones, so as to give the impression  of short side-whiskers, entered in a manner at once furtive and servile.    He wore a black overcoat and a bowler hat. Reclosing the door, he  turned, perceived the group in the study, and fell back as though  someone had struck him a fierce blow.    Abject terror was written upon his features, and, for a moment, the idea  of flight appeared to suggest itself urgently to him; but finally, he  took a step forward toward the study.    \"Who's this?\" snapped Dunbar, without removing his leonine eyes from the  newcomer.    \"It is Soames,\" came the weary voice of Leroux.    \"Butler?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Where's he been?\"    \"I don't know. He remained out without my permission.\"    \"He did, eh?\"    Inspector Dunbar thrust forth a long finger at the shrinking form in the  doorway.    \"Mr. Soames,\" he said, \"you will be going to your own room and waiting  there until I ring for you.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Soames, holding his hat in both bands, and speaking  huskily. \"Yes, sir: certainly, sir.\"    He crossed the lobby and disappeared.    \"There is no other way out, is there?\" inquired the detective, glancing  at Dr. Cumberly.    \"There is no other way,\" was the reply; \"but surely you don't  suspect\"...    \"I would suspect the Archbishop of Westminster,\" snapped Dunbar, \"if  he came in like that! Now, sir,\"--he turned to Leroux--\"you were alone,  here, to-night?\"    \"Quite alone, Inspector. The truth is, I fear, that my servants take  liberties in the absence of my wife.\"    \"In the absence of your wife? Where is your wife?\"    \"She is in Paris.\"    \"Is she a Frenchwoman?\"    \"No! oh, no! But my wife is a painter, you understand, and--er--I met  her in Paris--er--... Must you insist upon these--domestic particulars,  Inspector?\"    \"If Mr. Exel is anxious to turn in,\" replied the inspector, \"after his  no doubt exhausting duties at the House, and if Dr. Cumberly--\"    \"I have no secrets from Cumberly!\" interjected Leroux. \"The doctor  has known me almost from boyhood, but--er--\" turning to the  politician--\"don't you know, Exel--no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20293"],[0,"A Popular History of the Art of Music (#4)"],[1,"were not  music. Wagner felt these strange combinations as music. The deeper  relations between tones and chords apparently remote, he felt, and  employed them for the expression of his imagination. Other ears now  feel them as he did. An education has taken place.    5. It is altogether likely that the education will still go on until  many new combinations which to our ears would be meaningless will  become a part of the ordinary vernacular of the art. Indeed, a writer  quite recently (Julius Klauser, in \"The Septonnate\") points out a  vast amount of musical material already contained within our tonal  systems which as yet is entirely unused. The new chords and relations  thus suggested are quite in line with the additions made by Wagner to  the vocabulary of his day.      III.    6. There are certain conditions which must be met before a fine art  will be developed. These it is worth while to consider briefly:    The state of art, in any community or nation, at any period of its  history, depends upon a fortunate correspondence between two elements  which we might call the internal and the external. By the former is  meant the inner movement of mind or spirit, which must be of such  depth and force as to leave a surplusage after the material needs of  existence have been met. In every community where there is a certain  degree of wealth, leisure and a vigorous movement of mind, this  surplus force, remaining over after the necessary wheels of common  life have been set in motion, will expend itself in some form of art  or literature. The nature of the form selected as the expression of  this surplus force will depend upon the fashion, the prevalent  activity of the life of the day, or, in other words, the environment.  Illustrating this principle, reference might be made to the condition  of Greek art in the flowering time of its history, when the wealth of  Athens was so great as to leave resources unemployed in the material  uses of life, and when the intellectual movement was so splendid as to  leave it until now a brilliant tradition of history. Only one form of  art was pre-eminently successful here; it was sculpture, which at that  time reached its fullest development--to such a degree that modern  sculpture is only a weak repetition of ancient works in this line. So  also the brilliant period of Italian painting, when the mental  movement represented by Leonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, Lorenzo de  Medici, and the pleasure-loving existence, the brilliant fetes, in  which noble men and beautifully appareled women performed all sorts of  allegorical representations, and the colors, groupings, etc., afforded  the painter an endless variety of material and suggestion. When Rubens  flourished in the Netherlands, a century later, similar conditions  accompanied his appearance and the prolific manifestations of his  genius. In the same way, music depends upon peculiar conditions of its  own. They are three: The vigor of the mental movement in general, its  strength upon the imaginative and sentimental side, and the suggestion  from the environment in the way of musical instruments of adequate  tonal powers. Such instruments never existed in the history of the art  until about the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The organ, the  violin and the predecessor of the pianoforte, the spinet, came to  practical form at nearly the same time. At the same time the  instruments of plucked strings--the guitars, lutes and other  instruments which until then had occupied the exclusive attention of  musicians--began to go out. Moreover, musical science had been worked  out, and the arts of counterpoint, canonic imitation, fugue, harmony,  etc., had all reached a high degree of perfection when Bach and Haendel  appeared.    7. The entire history of music is merely an illustration of these  principles. Wherever there has been vigorous movement of mind and  material prosperity (and they have always been associated) there has  been an art of music, the richness of which, however, has always been  limited by the state of the musical ears of the people or generation,  and the perfection of their musical instruments. The instruments are  an indispensable ingredient in musical progress, since it is only by  means of instruments that tonal combinations can be exactly repeated,  the voice mastering the more difficult relations of tones only when  the ear has become quick to perceive tonal relations, and tenacious to  retain them--in other words, educated. Hence in the pages following,  the instruments peculiar to each epoch will receive the attention  their importance deserves, which is considerably more than that  usually allotted them in concise accounts of the history of this art.    8. The conditions of a satisfactory Art Form are three: Unity, the  expression of a single ruling idea; variety, the relief of the  monotony due to the over-ascendency of unity (or contrast, an exact  and definite form of variety); and symmetry, or the due proportion of  the different parts of the work as a whole. These principles,  universally recognized as governing in the other fine arts, are  equally valid in music. As will be seen later, all musical progress  has been toward their more complete attainment and their due  co-ordination into a single satisfactory whole. Every musical form  that has ever been created is an effort to solve this problem; and  analysis shows which one of the leading principles has been most  considered, and the manner in which it has been carried out. Ancient  music was very weak in all respects, and never fully attained the  first of these qualities. Modern music has mastered all three to a  very respectable degree.    9. The art of music appears to have been earliest of all the fine arts  in the order of time; but it has been longer than any of the others in  reaching its maturity, most of the master works now current having  been created within the last two centuries, and the greater proportion  of them within the last century. Sculpture came to its perfection in  Greece about 500 B.C.; architecture about 1200 to 1300 A.D., when the  great European cathedrals were built; painting about 1500 to 1600 A.D.  Poetry, like music, representing the continual life of soul, has never  been completed, new works of highest quality remaining possible as  long as hearts can feel and minds can conceive; but the productions of  Shakespeare, about 1650, are believed to represent a point of  perfection not likely to be surpassed. Music, on the other hand, has  been continually progressive, at least until the appearance of  Beethoven, about the beginning of the present century, and the  romantic composers between 1830 and the present time.      IV.    10. The history of music may be divided into two great  periods--_Ancient_ and _Modern_--the Christian era forming a dividing  line between them. Each of these periods, again, may be subdivided  into two other periods, one long, the other quite short--an Apprentice  Period, when types of instruments were being found out, melodic or  harmonic forms mastered; in other words, the tonal sense undergoing  its primary education. The other, a Master Period, when an art of  music suddenly blossoms out, complete and satisfactory according to  the principles recognized by the musicians of the time. In the natural  course of things such an art, having once found its heart, ought to go  on to perfection; but this has not generally been the case. After a  period of vigorous growth and the production of master works suitable  to the time, a decline has ensued, and at length musical productivity  has entirely ceased. Occasionally a cessation in art progress of this  kind may have been dependent upon the failure of one or other of the  primary conditions of successful art mentioned above, especially the  failure of material prosperity. This had something to do with the  cessation of progress in ancient Egypt, very likely; but more often  the stoppage of progress has been due to the exhaustion of the  suggestive powers of the musical instruments in use. The composers of  the music of ancient Greece had for instruments only lyres of six or  eight strings, with little vibrative power. After ten centuries of use  every suggestion in the compass of these instruments to furnish, had  been carried out. If other and richer instruments could have been  introduced, no doubt Greek music would have taken a new lease of life,  _i.e._, supposing that the material prosperity had remained constant.    The apprentice periods of ancient history extend back to the earliest  traces of music which we have, beginning perhaps with the early Aryans  in central Asia, whom Max Mueller represents as circling around the  family altar at sunrise and sunset, and with clasped hands repeating  in musical tones a hymn, perhaps one of the earliest of those in the  Vedas, or a still older one. From this early association of music with  religious worship we derive something of our heredity of reverence for  the art, a sentiment which in all ages has associated music with  religious ritual and worship, and out of which has come much of the  tender regard we have for it as the expression of home and love in the  higher aspects.    All the leading types of instruments were discovered in the early  periods of human history, but the full powers of the best have been  reached only in recent times.    11. The art of music was highly esteemed in antiquity, and every great  nation had a form of its own. But it was only in three or four  countries that an art was developed of such beauty and depth of  principle as to have interest for us. The countries where this was  done were Egypt, Greece and India.    12. Modern music differs from ancient in two radical points: Tonality,  or the dependence of all tones in the series upon a single leading  tone called the Key; and Harmony, or the satisfactory use of combined  sounds.
