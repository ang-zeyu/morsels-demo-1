We have--but mind, this must  go no further--sure news that Russia, Austria, France, and Saxony  have formed a secret league against Prussia, and that they intend  to crush us first, and then partition the kingdom among themselves.  The Empress of Austria has shamelessly denied that any such treaty  exists, but tomorrow morning a messenger will start, with a demand  from the king that the treaty shall be publicly acknowledged and  then broken off, or that he will at once proclaim war. If we say  nine days for the journey there, nine days to return, and three  days waiting for the answer, you see that in three weeks from the  present we may be on the move, for our only chance depends upon  striking a heavy blow before they are ready. We have not wasted our  time. The king has already made an alliance with England.\"    \"But England has no troops, or scarcely any,\" Fergus said.    \"No, lad, but she has what is of quite as much importance in  war--namely, money, and she can grant us a large subsidy. The  king's interest in the matter is almost as great as ours. He is a  Hanoverian more than an Englishman, and you may be sure that, if  Prussia were to be crushed, the allies would make but a single bite  of Hanover. You see, this will be a war of life and death to us,  and the fighting will be hard and long.\"    \"But what grievance has France against the king?\"    \"His majesty is open spoken, and no respecter of persons; and a  woman may forgive an injury, but never a scornful gibe. It is this  that has brought both France and Russia on him. Madame Pompadour,  who is all powerful, hates Frederick for having made disrespectful  remarks concerning her. The Empress of Russia detests him, for the  same reason. She of Austria has a better cause, for she has never  forgiven the loss of Silesia; and it is the enmity of these women,  as much as the desire to partition Prussia, that is about to plunge  Europe into a war to the full as terrible as that of the thirty  years.\"    Keith now rung a bell, and a soldier entered.    \"Tell Lieutenant Lindsay that I wish to speak to him.\"    A minute later an officer entered the room, and saluted stiffly.    \"Lindsay, this is a young cousin of mine, Fergus Drummond. The king  has appointed him to a cornetcy in the 3rd Royal Dragoon Guards,  but he is going to be one of my aides-de-camp. Now that things are  beginning to move, you and Gordon will need help.    \"Take him first to Tautz. I have written a note to the man, telling  him that he must hurry everything on. There is still a spare room  on your corridor, is there not? Get your man to see his things  bestowed there. I shall get his appointment this evening, I expect,  but it will be a day or two before he will be able to get a soldier  from his regiment. He has a horse to sell, and various other  matters to see to. At any rate, look after him, till tomorrow. 'Tis  my hour to go to the king.\"    Lindsay was a young man of two or three and twenty. He had a merry,  joyous face, a fine figure, and a good carriage; but until he and  Fergus were beyond the limits of the palace, he walked by the lad's  side with scarce a word. When once past the entrance, however, he  gave a sigh of relief.    \"Now, Drummond,\" he said, \"we will shake hands, and begin to make  each other's acquaintance. First, I am Nigel Lindsay, very much at  your service. On duty I am another person altogether, scarcely  recognizable even by myself--a sort of wooden machine, ready, when  a button is touched, to bring my heels smartly together, and my  hand to the salute. There is something in the air that stiffens  one's backbone, and freezes one from the tip of one's toes to the  end of one's pigtail. When one is with the marshal alone, one  thaws; for there is no better fellow living, and he chats to us as  if we were on a mountain side in Scotland, instead of in  Frederick's palace. But one is always being interrupted; either a  general, or a colonel, or possibly the king himself, comes in.    \"For the time, one becomes a military statue; and even when they  go, it is difficult to take up the talk as it was left. Oh, it is  wearisome work, and heartily glad I shall be, when the trumpets  blow and we march out of Berlin. However, we are beginning to be  pretty busy. I have been on horseback, twelve hours a day on an  average, for the past week. Gordon started yesterday for Magdeburg,  and Macgregor has been two days absent, but I don't know where.  Everyone is busy, from the king himself--who is always busy about  something--to the youngest drummer. Nobody outside a small circle  knows what it is all about. Apparently we are in a state of  profound peace, without a cloud in the sky, and yet the military  preparations are going on actively, everywhere.    \"Convoys of provisions are being sent to the frontier fortresses.  Troops are in movement from the Northern Provinces. Drilling is  going on--I was going to say night and day, for it is pretty nearly  that--and no one can make out what it is all about.    \"There is one thing--no one asks questions. His majesty thinks for  his subjects, and as he certainly is the cleverest man in his  dominions, everyone is well content that it should be so.    \"And now, about yourself. I am running on and talking nonsense,  when I have all sorts of questions to ask you. But that is always  the way with me. I am like a bottle of champagne, corked down while  I am in the palace, and directly I get away the cork flies out by  itself, and for a minute or two it is all froth and emptiness.    \"Now, when did you arrive, how did you arrive, what is the last  news from Scotland, which of the branches of the Drummonds do you  belong to, and how near of kin are you to the marshal? Oh, by the  way, I ought to know the last without asking; as you are a  Drummond, and a relation of Keith, you can be no other than the son  of the Drummond of Tarbet, who married Margaret Ogilvie, who was a  first cousin of Keith's.\"    \"That is right,\" Fergus said. \"My father fell at Culloden, you  know. As to all your other questions, they are answered easily  enough. I know very little of the news in Scotland, for my mother  lived a very secluded life at Kilgowrie, and little news came to us  from without. I came from Leith to Stettin, and there I bought a  horse and rode on here.\"    His companion laughed.    \"And how about yourself? I suppose you know nothing of this beastly  language?\"    \"Yes; I can speak it pretty fluently, and of course know French.\"    \"I congratulate you, though how you learnt it, up in the hills, I  know not. I did not know a word of it, when I came out two years  ago; and it is always on my mind, for of course I have a master  who, when I am not otherwise engaged, comes to me for an hour a  day, and well nigh maddens me with his crack-jaw words; but I don't  seem to make much progress. If I am sent with an order, and the  officer to whom I take it does not understand French, I am floored.  Of course I hand the order, if it is a written one, to him. If it  is not, but just some verbal message, asking him to call on the  marshal at such and such a time, I generally make a horrible mess  of it. He gets in a rage with me, because he cannot understand me.  I get in a rage with him, for his dulness; and were it not that he  generally manages to find some other officer, who does understand  French, the chances are very strongly against Keith's message being  attended to.    \"First of all, I will take you to our quarters. That is the house.\"    \"Why, I thought you lodged in the palace?\"    \"Heaven forbid! Macgregor has a room in the chief's suite of apartments.  He is senior aide-de-camp, and if there is any message to be sent late,  he takes it; but that is not often the case.  Gordon lodges here with  me. The house is a sort of branch establishment to the palace. Malcolm  Menzies and Horace Farquhar, two junior aides of the king, are in the  same corridor with us. Of course we make up a party by ourselves. Then  there are ten or twelve German officers--some of them aides-de-camp  of the Princes Maurice and Henry, the Prince of Bevern and General  Schwerin--besides a score or so of palace officials.    \"Fortunately the Scotch corridor, as we call it, has a separate  entrance, so we can go in or out without disturbing anyone. It is a  good thing, for in fact we and the Prussians do not get on very  well together. They have a sort of jealousy of us; which is, I  suppose, natural enough. Foreigners are never favourites, and  George's Hanoverian officers are not greatly loved in London. I  expect a campaign will do good, that way. They will see, at any  rate, that we don't take our pay for nothing, and are ready to do a  full share and more of fighting; while we shall find that these  stiff pipe-clayed figures are brave fellows, and good comrades,  when they get a little of the starch washed out of them.    \"Now, this is my room, and I see my man has got dinner ready.\"        Chapter 2: Joining.      In answer to the shout of \"Donald,\" a tall man in the pantaloons of  a Prussian regiment, but with his tunic laid aside, came out from a  small room that served as a kitchen, and dormitory, for himself.    \"I am just ready, sir,\" he said. \"Hearing you talking as you came  along, and not knowing who you might have with you, I just ran in  to put on my coat; but as you passed, and I heard it was Scottish  you were speaking, I knew that it didna matter.\"    \"Put another plate and goblet on the table, Donald. I hope that you  have meat enough for two of us.\"    \"Plenty for four,\" the soldier said. \"The market was full this  morning, and the folk so ta'en up wi' this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19715"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Norwich (#4)"],[1,"their gates. Had the prior at this juncture chosen to act  peacefully, it is probable that history would contain no record of the  sacrilege that followed. He, however, decided to resist force by force,  and carefully generaled his monks, disposing them at the various  strategic points of his domain. At the same time he sent to Yarmouth for  mercenaries--these arrived and the tables were turned; the prior's  forces sallied forth from the gates and robbed and pillaged the town.    The citizens, roused to a pitch of madness, drove them and the soldiers  back again within the walls of the monastery; the bishop, instead of  acting as peacemaker, appears to have preserved his position of  neutrality and quietly stopped in his palace. There was a short interval  of truce, but it only served as a breath to fan the flames; the citizens  besieged the cathedral precincts, and by the means probably of slings  succeeded in hurling combustible materials into the buildings, with a  result that the whole of the monastery and the cathedral itself was soon  in flames. It seems to be an established fact that the prior had placed  men in the tower to shoot at the citizens, and it is conjectured that  they, and not the citizens, were the cause of the outbreak here.    The only part of the cathedral that escaped was the Lady Chapel; the  rest was gutted, vestments and ornaments were carried off, and the monks  for the most part slain.    So ended the first part of this lamentable chapter in the history of  Norwich. A sentence of excommunication was passed on the city, and King  Henry hastened to Norwich to preside at the trial of the prisoners.    The accounts which have come down to us are as varied as might be  expected, the chroniclers of the one party, of course, blaming the other  side; it seems, however, to have been proved \"that, after all, the  church was burnt by that accursed prior\"; but many of the citizens were  hung, drawn and quartered, and the city had to pay in all 3000 marks  towards repairing the church and monastical buildings, and to provide a  gold pyx, weighing ten pounds, of gold; the monks in their turn had to  make new gates and entrances into the precincts. The St. Ethelbert's  Gate-house was part of the work imposed on the monks; it is of early  Decorated character and was erected probably early in the fourteenth  century.    Bishop Roger de Skerning had died in retirement on the 22nd of January  1277, and in the meantime the work of reparation had proceeded with such  vigour that on Advent Sunday 1278 his successor, Bishop Middleton, was  inaugurated with great state; Edward I. and his Queen with the Bishops  of London, Hereford, and Waterford being present. He does not seem to  have done much in the way of building, though the work of reparation was  carried on; he died in 1287, and it was left to his successor, Bishop  Ralph de Walpole, to begin the work of rebuilding the cloisters. The  original Norman cloisters, which had endured until the time of the great  fire in 1272, were probably of wood. It was determined to rebuild them  in stone in the prevailing style. The cloisters are described in more  detail in the notes on the interior of the cathedral, so that it will be  sufficient to state here that their building spread over a period of one  hundred and thirty-three years, and that they were finished during the  episcopate of Bishop Alnwick.    [Illustration: West Front of the Cathedral in 1816.]    Bishop Walpole built the eastern walk of the cloisters, together with  the chapter-house; he was translated to Ely about 1299, and the work  carried on by his successor, Bishop Salmon, who built the south walk,  also a chapel and hall attached to the bishop's palace. Of this nothing  remains in the garden of the palace except a grand ruin, which is  supposed to have formed the entrance or porch to the hall.    He founded also the chapel dedicated to St. John the Evangelist,  converted by Edward VI. into, and now used as, a grammar school; below  it was a charnel-house.    Continuing the history of the fabric, we can pass on to the episcopate  of Bishop Percy, during which, about 1361, the wooden spire and parts of  central tower of the cathedral were blown down by a violent gale of  wind, and the presbytery was greatly damaged by the falling material.  This bishop rebuilt the present clerestory, designed in the transitional  style between Decorated and Perpendicular; the vault is later. It is  also probable that he repaired the spire.    During Bishop Wakering's time the Erpingham gate of the close was  erected, and as well the cloister that formerly connected the palace on  the north side with the cathedral. He also founded a chantry for one  monk at his tomb.    His successor, Alnwick, completed the cloisters. The gateway to the  palace was built by him about 1430, and probably replaced an earlier  structure. He also began the work of remodelling the central compartment  of the west front. He left directions in his will to his executors to  make a large west window, the cost to be charged to his estate. The  doorway under this window, built over the old Norman one, and  encroaching on the side arcading, was executed during his episcopate,  the window being eventually added during the time of Bishop Lyhart to  throw additional light on to the vault he erected, and its wonderful  sculptures.    In 1446, on February 27th, Walter Lyhart, or le Hart, was consecrated,  and it is to him that Norwich Cathedral owes the superb _lierne_ vault  that now spans the nave. Other important works were carried out by him;  the spire which had been blown down in 1362 (and had probably been  re-constructed by Bishop Percy--though there is no record of such work),  was struck by lightning in 1463, and the burning mass fell through the  presbytery roof, which up till this period was still in wood, completely  destroying it, and making necessary the vault added by Lyhart's  successor.    During this episcopate the rood screen was erected, and a sumptuous  monument placed over the grave of the founder.    The stone spire must have been added about this time, replacing the  former wooden construction.    Bishop Lyhart left to his successor, Bishop Goldwell, in his will 2200  marks for repairing the dilapidations caused by the fire of 1463. During  this bishop's episcopate we find that the cathedral was brought nearly  to that state in which we have it now,--the tower was still further  adorned with Perpendicular battlements, the presbytery was vaulted in  with stone, and the flying-buttresses added around the eastern apse to  take the consequent thrust of the new vault.    Internally, also, the lower stages of the presbytery were  Perpendicularised by the addition of the four centred arches that still  remain, and in the second bay of which, eastward from the tower, on the  south side, was erected Bishop Goldwell's altar tomb.    His successor, Lane, occupied the see but a short while, 1499-1500, and  in turn was succeeded by Bishop Nykke--he is more generally called _Nix_  (snow), sarcastically, as his character appears to have been of the  blackest. During his episcopate, the cathedral was again visited by fire  in 1509. The sacristy, with all the books and ornaments, was consumed,  and the wooden roofs of both transepts totally destroyed.    Bishop Nykke constructed the stone vaulting that, covering both arms of  the church, completed the stone vaulting throughout the cathedral. His  chantry, which is on the south side of the nave, and occupies two bays  of the aisle, was arranged by him before his death, and its richness is  inversely proportionate to the degradation of his character.    The tracery in the Norman arch leading from the south aisle of the  presbytery into the transept, is of late Perpendicular style, and was  added by Robert of Calton, who was destined to be the last prior but one  of Norwich: William Castleton was the last prior and the first dean.  Bishop Nykke died in 1535-6, and was succeeded by William Rupgg or  Repes, who was the last bishop elected by the chapter of the monks of  the Benedictine monastery of Norwich. Monasticism was doomed; Wolsey had  fallen, and his property had been confiscated in 1529. The smaller  monasteries were dissolved in 1536, and in 1538 the greater shared the  same fate, among them Norwich.    Most interesting is the parallel which can be drawn between the history  of the Church and of that architecture which she especially fostered.  Gothic or Christian art was developed from the remains of a Roman  civilisation, and so long as it had the healthy organic growth which was  consequent on the evolution of a series of constructive problems fairly  faced and in turn conquered, and again, stimulated by the growth of the  Church, to which it was handmaiden, developed style after style in  regular sequence, until the builders, finding they had conquered  construction, took to imposing ornament. From that time, instead of  ornamenting construction, they constructed ornament; and as the  Reformation came to the Church in the sixteenth century so to  architecture came degradation. And then the Renaissance of pagan types,  from which the Gothic had derived its being by a rational development,  was by the revivalists of those days hotch-potched into a more or less  homogeneous mass, which even the genius of Wren could leave but coldly  pedantic.    The history of the architecture of the cathedral might safely stop with  the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538, since when it is a mere  recapitulation of the doings and undoings of various sets of more or  less deeply incriminated fanatics and restorers.    So that we do not feel inclined to enter into more detail, in the few  remaining notes on the history of the structure.    Dean Gardiner, 1573-89, was a great reformer, and, as we have already  noted, pulled down the thirteenth-century Lady Chapel, and as well the"]]]
