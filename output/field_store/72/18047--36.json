Da Gama, the first who sailed direct from Lisbon to  India round Africa, and Albuquerque, the maker, if not the founder, of  the Portuguese empire in the East, were simply the realisers of the vast  ambitions that take their start from the work and life of Prince Henry,  and he has a right to claim them as two leading champions of his plans  and policy. In many points Albuquerque, like Columbus, is more than a  follower; but in the main outline of his achievement he follows upon the  work of other men, and, among these men, of none so much as the Hero of  Portugal and of modern discovery.    Lastly. I have to thank many friends generally for their constant  kindness and readiness to assist in any way, and in particular several  for the most generous and valuable help in certain parts.    Mr. T.A. Archer, besides the benefit of his suggestions throughout, has  given special aid in Chapters I., III., V., and the Introductory  Chapter, especially where anything is said of the connection of  geographical progress with the Crusades.[7]    [Footnote 7: Compare Archer and Kingsford, _The Crusades_, in the  _Stories of the Nations_.]    Mr. F. York Powell has revised Chapter II. on the Vikings, and Professor  Margoliouth has done the same for the Introductory Chapter on Greek and  Arabic geography; Mr. Coote has not only given me every help in the map  room of the British Museum, but has read the proofs of Chapter V. Mr.  H. Yule-Oldham in Chapter XVIII. on the Voyage of Cadamosto, and Mr.  Prestage in Chapters VIII. and IX. on Prince Henry's capture of Ceuta  and settlement at Sagres, have been most kind in offering suggestions.  For several hints useful in Chapter I.--the early Christian pilgrims--I  have also to thank Professor Sanday; and for revision of a great part of  the proof-sheets of the entire book, Mr. G.N. Richardson and the Rev.  W.H. Hutton.    As to the illustrations, of portraits and monuments, etc., I am  especially obliged to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University (Dr.  Boyd), who has allowed his water-colour paintings of Portuguese subjects  to be reproduced; and to the Rev. R. Livingstone of Pembroke, and Sir  John Hawkins of Oriel, for their loan of photographs.          PRINCE HENRY THE NAVIGATOR.

THOMSON: _Seasons, Summer, 1010-2._            INTRODUCTION.    THE GREEK AND ARABIC IDEAS OF THE WORLD, AS THE CHIEF INHERITANCE OF THE  CHRISTIAN MIDDLE AGES IN GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE.      Arabic science constitutes one of the main links between the older  learned world of the Greeks and Latins and the Europe of Henry the  Navigator and of the Renaissance. In geography it adopted in the main  the results of Ptolemy and Strabo; and many of the Moslem travellers and  writers gained some additional hints from Indian, Persian, and Chinese  knowledge; but, however much of fact they added to Greek cartography,  they did not venture to correct its postulates.    And what were these postulates? In part, they were the assumptions of  modern draughtsmen, but in some important details they differed. And  first, as to agreement. Three continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, an  encircling ocean, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and Caspian, the Red  Sea and Persian Gulf, the South Asiatic, and North and West European  coasts were indicated with more or less precision in the science of the  Antonines and even of Hannibal's age. Similarly, the Nile and Danube,  Euphrates and Tigris, Indus and Ganges, Jaxartes and Oxus, Rhine and  Ebro, Don and Volga, with the chief mountain ranges of Europe and  Western Asia, find themselves pretty much in their right places in  Strabo's description, and are still better placed in the great chart of  Ptolemy. The countries and nations from China to Spain are arranged in  the order of modern knowledge. But the differences were fundamental  also. Never was there a clearer outrunning of knowledge by theory,  science by conjecture, than in Ptolemy's scheme of the world (_c._ A.D.  130). His chief predecessors, Eratosthenes and Strabo, had left much  blank space in their charts, and had made many mistakes in detail, but  they had caught the main features of the Old World with fair accuracy.  Ptolemy, in trying to fill up what he did not know from his inner  consciousness, evolved a parody of those features. His map, from its  intricate falsehood, backed as it was by the greatest name in  geographical science, paralysed all real enlargement of knowledge till  men began to question, not only his facts, but his theories. And as  all modern science, in fact, followed the progress of world-knowledge,  or \"geography,\" we may see how important it was for this revolution to  take place, for Ptolemy to be dethroned.    [Illustration: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO PTOLEMY. (SEE LIST OF MAPS)]    The Arabs, commanding most of the centres of ancient learning (Ptolemy's  own Alexandria above all), riveted the pseudo-science of their  predecessors on the learned world, along with the genuine knowledge  which they handed down from the Greeks. In many details they corrected  and amplified the Greek results. But most of their geographical theories  were mere reproductions of Ptolemy's, and to his mistakes they added  wilder though less important confusions or inventions of their own. The  result of all this, by the tenth century A.D., was a geography, based  not on knowledge, but on ideas of symmetry. It was a scheme fit for the  _Arabian Nights_.    And how did Ptolemy lend himself to this?    His chief mistakes were only two;--but they were mistakes from which at  any rate Strabo and most of the Greek geographers are free. He made the  Indian Ocean an inland sea, and he filled up the Southern Hemisphere  with Africa, or the unknown Antarctic land in which he extended  Africa.[8] The Dark Continent, in his map, ran out on the one side to  the south-east of China, and on the other to the indefinite west, though  there was here no hint of America or an Atlantic continent. It was a  triumph of learned imagination over humdrum research. Science under  Hadrian was ambitious to have its world settled and known; it was not  yet settled or fully known; and so a great student constructed a  _melange_ of fact and fancy mainly based on a guess-work of imaginary  astronomical reckonings. On the far east, Ptolemy joined China and  Africa; and on this imaginary western coast, fronting Malacca and  Further India, he placed various gratuitous towns and rivers. Coming to  smaller matters, he cut away the whole of the Indian peninsula proper,  though preserving the Further or \"Golden\" Chersonesus of the Malays, and  he enlarged Taprobane, or Ceylon, to double the size of Asia Minor. Thus  the southern coast of Asia from Arabia to the Ganges ran almost due  east, with a strait of sea coming through the modern Carnatic, between  the continent and the Great Spice Island, which included most of the  Deccan. The Persian Gulf, much greater on this map than the Black Sea,  was made equal in length and breadth; the shape of the Caspian was, so  to say, turned inside out and its length given as from east to west,  instead of from north to south; while the coast line, even of the  familiar Euxine, AEgean, and Southern Mediterranean, was anything but  true. Scandinavia was an island smaller than Ireland; Scotland  represented a great eastern bend of Britain, with the Shetlands and  Faeroes (Thule) lying a short distance to the north, but on the left-hand  side of the great island. The Sea of Azov, hardly inferior to the  Euxine, stretched north half way across Russia. All Central Africa and  the great Southern or Antarctic continent was described as pathless  desert--\"a land uninhabitable from the heat\"; and the sources of the  Nile were accounted for by the marshes and Mountains of the Moon.    [Footnote 8: Rejecting the old idea of an encircling ocean as the girdle  or limit of the known world, and replacing it with a new fancy of  unbounded continent (on all sides except the north-west)--a fancy which  the vast extension of Roman Dominion under the Empire may have  fostered.]    Thus all the problems of ancient geography were explained: where  Ptolemy's knowledge failed him altogether, no Western of that time had  ever been, or was likely to go. The whole realised and unrealised world  was described with such clearness and consistency, men thought, that  what was lacking in Aristotle was now supplied.    Yet it is worth while observing how, centuries before Ptolemy, in the  ages nearer to Aristotle himself, the geography of Eratosthenes and  Strabo, by a more balanced use of knowledge and by a greater restraint  of fancy, had composed a far more reliable chart.[9]    [Footnote 9: In using the expressions \"Chart,\" or \"Map\" of Strabo's  description (_c._ A.D. 20), it is not meant to imply that Strabo himself  left more than a written description from which a plan was afterwards  prepared: \"The world according to Strabo.\" The same applies to  Eratosthenes (_c._ B.C. 200) and all pre-Ptolemaic Greek geographers.

In consequence of this confession, the chevalier, after a  few days, was convicted upon his own acknowledgment, and beheaded on a  scaffold in the Isle of Notre Dame.    The editor of the Portland (Maine) Advertiser relates the following  anecdote: \"A gentleman from the country recently drove up to a store in  this city, and jumping from his sleigh, left his dog in the care of the  vehicle. Presently an avalanche of snow slid from the top of the  building upon the sidewalk, which so frightened the horse that he  started off down the street at a furious run. At this critical juncture,  the dog sprang from the sleigh, and seizing the reins in his mouth, held  back with all his strength, and actually reined in the frightened animal  to a post at the side of the street, when apparently having satisfied  himself that no danger was to be apprehended, he again resumed his  station in the sleigh, as unconcerned as if he had only done an ordinary  act of duty.\"    A few years ago a little girl, residing in an inland village in  Connecticut--without the consent of her mother, be it remembered--went  alone to a pond near by, to play with her brother's little vessel, and  fell into the water. She came very near drowning; but a dog belonging to  the family, named Rollo, who was not far off, plunged in and drew her to  the shore. She was so exhausted, however, that she could not rise, and  the dog could not lift her entirely out of the water. But he raised her  head a little above the surface, and then ran after help. He found a  man, and made use of every expedient in his power to draw him to the  spot where he had left the child. At first the stranger paid very little  attention to the dog; but by and by he was persuaded something was  wrong, and followed the dog to the pond. The little girl was not  drowned, though she was quite insensible; and the man lifted her from  the water, and saved her life, to the great joy of Rollo, who seemed  eager to assist in this enterprise.    Here is a capital story about a shepherd's dog in Scotland. I take the  liberty of borrowing it from Bingley's admirable book. The valleys, or  glens, as they are called by the natives, which intersect the Grampians,  a ridge of rocky and precipitous mountains in the northern part of  Scotland, are chiefly inhabited by shepherds. As the pastures over which  each flock is permitted to range, extend many miles in every direction,  the shepherd never has a view of his whole flock at once, except when it  is collected for the purpose of sale or shearing. His occupation is to  make daily visits to the different extremities of his pastures in  succession, and to turn back, by means of his dog, any stragglers that  may be approaching the boundaries of his neighbors.    [Illustration: EXPLOIT OF THE NEW ENGLAND DOG.]    In one of these excursions, a shepherd happened to carry with him one of  his children, an infant some two or three years old. After traversing  his pastures for some time, attended by his dog, the shepherd found  himself under the necessity of ascending a summit at some distance to  have a more extended view of his range. As the ascent was too fatiguing  for his child, he left him on a small plain at the bottom, with strict  injunctions not to stir from it till his return. Scarcely, however, had  he gained the summit, when the horizon was suddenly darkened by one of  those thick and heavy fogs which frequently descend so rapidly amid  these mountains, as, in the space of a few minutes, almost to turn day  into night. The anxious father instantly hastened back to find his  child; but, owing to the unusual darkness, and his own trepidation, he  unfortunately missed his way in the descent. After a fruitless search of  many hours among the dangerous morasses and cataracts with which these  mountains abound, he was at length overtaken by night. Still wandering  on, without knowing whither, he at length came to the verge of the mist,  and, by the light of the moon, discovered that he had reached the bottom  of the valley, and was now within a short distance of his cottage. To  renew the search that night was equally fruitless and dangerous. He was  therefore obliged to return home, having lost both his child and his  dog, which had attended him faithfully for years.    Next morning by day-break, the shepherd, accompanied by a band of his  neighbors, set out again to seek his child; but, after a day spent in  fruitless fatigue, he was at last compelled by the approach of night to  descend from the mountain. On returning to his cottage, he found that  the dog which he had lost the day before, had been home, and, on  receiving a piece of cake, had instantly gone off again. For several  successive days the shepherd renewed the search for his child, and  still, on returning in the evening disappointed to his cottage, he found  that the dog had been there, and, on receiving his usual allowance of  cake, had instantly disappeared. Struck with this singular circumstance,  he remained at home one day, and when the dog, as usual, departed with  his piece of cake, he resolved to follow him, and find out the cause of  this strange procedure. The dog led the way to a cataract at some  distance from the spot where the shepherd had left his child. The banks  of the waterfall, almost joined at the top, yet separated by an abyss of  immense depth, presented that abrupt appearance which so often  astonishes and appalls the traveler amid the Grampian mountains, and  indicates that these stupendous chasms were not the silent work of  time, but the sudden effect of some violent convulsion of the earth.  Down one of these rugged and almost perpendicular descents the dog  began, without hesitation, to make his way, and at last disappeared in a  cave, the mouth of which was almost on a level with the torrent. The  shepherd with difficulty followed; but, on entering the cave, what were  his emotions, when he beheld his infant eating with much satisfaction  the cake which the dog had just brought him, while the faithful animal  stood by, eyeing his young charge with the utmost complacency! From the  situation in which the child was found, it appeared that he had wandered  to the brink of the precipice, and either fallen or scrambled down till  he reached the cave, which the dread of the torrent had afterward  prevented him from quitting. The dog, by means of his scent, had traced  him to the spot, and afterward prevented him from starving, by giving up  to him his own daily allowance. He appears never to have quitted the  child by night or day, except when it was necessary to go for his food,  and then he was always seen running at full speed to and from the  cottage.    [Illustration: A SHEPHERD'S DOG FEEDING A LOST CHILD]    The following story is related on the authority of a correspondent of  the Boston Traveler: A gentleman from abroad, stopping at a hotel in  Boston, privately secreted his handkerchief behind the cushion of a  sofa, and left the hotel, in company with his dog. After walking for  some minutes, he suddenly stopped, and said to his dog, \"I have left my  handkerchief at the hotel, and want it\"--giving no particular directions  in reference to it. The dog immediately returned in full speed, and  entered the room which his master had just left. He went directly to the  sofa, but the handkerchief was gone. He jumped upon tables and counters,  but it was not to be seen. It proved that a friend had discovered it,  and supposing that it had been left by mistake, had retained it for the  owner. But Tiger was not to be foiled. He flew about the room,  apparently much excited, in quest of the \"lost or stolen.\" Soon,  however, he was upon the track; he scented it to the gentleman's coat  pocket. What was to be done? The dog had no means of asking verbally for  it, and was not accustomed to picking pockets; and, besides, the  gentleman was ignorant of his business with him. But Tiger's sagacity  did not suffer him to remain long in suspense; he seized the skirt  containing the prize, and furiously tore it from the coat, and hastily  made off with it, much to the surprise of its owner. Tiger overtook his  master, and restored the lost property, receiving his approbation,  notwithstanding he did it at the expense of the gentleman's coat. At a  subsequent interview, the gentleman refused any remuneration for his  torn garment, declaring that the joke was worth the price of his coat.    One day, as a little girl was amusing herself with a child, near  Carlisle Bridge, Dublin, and was sportively toying with the child, he  made a sudden spring from her arms, and in an instant fell into the  river. The screaming nurse and anxious spectators saw the water close  over the child, and conceived that he had sunk to rise no more. A  Newfoundland dog, which had been accidentally passing with his master,  sprang forward to the wall, and gazed wistfully at the ripple in the  water, made by the child's descent. At the same instant the dog sprang  forward to the edge of the water. While the animal was descending, the  child again sunk, and the faithful creature was seen anxiously swimming  round and round the spot where he had disappeared. Once more the child  rose to the surface; the dog seized him, and with a firm but gentle  pressure, bore him to land without injury. Meanwhile a gentleman  arrived, who, on inquiry into the circumstances of the transaction,  exhibited strong marks of interest and feeling toward the child, and of  admiration for the dog that had rescued him from death. The person who  had removed the child from the dog turned to show him to the gentleman,  when there were presented to his view the well-known features of his own  son! A mixed sensation of terror, joy, and surprise, struck him mute.  When he had recovered the use of his faculties, and fondly kissed his  little darling, he lavished a"]]]
