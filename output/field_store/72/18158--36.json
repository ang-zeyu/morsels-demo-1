The proper shape for balance  pivots was shown in Fig. 4. Now let us examine into the best positions  for holding the gravers. In Fig. 13 two ways of holding the graver are  shown, _A_ representing the right and _B_ representing the wrong way. If  the graver is applied to the work as shown at _A_, it will cut a clean  shaving, while if applied as shown at _B_ it will simply scrape the side  of the pivot and ruin the point of the graver without materially  forwarding the work. Again, the holding of the graver as indicated at _A_  has its advantages, because the force of the cut is towards the hand  holding it, and should it catch from any cause the jar of the obstruction  will be conveyed immediately to the hand, and it will naturally give and  no harm will be done. If, on the other hand, the graver should meet with  an obstruction while held in the position indicated at _B_, the force of  the cut will be in the direction of the arrow, downward and toward the  rest, and the rest being unlike the hand, or rather being rigid, it  cannot give, and the result is that the work, or graver, or both, are  ruined. In Fig. 14 two other methods of holding the graver are shown. The  general roughing out of a staff should be done with the graver held about  as shown at _A_, Fig. 13; but in finishing, the graver should be held so  that the cut is made diagonally, as indicated at _A_, Fig. 14. It is  rather dificult to explain in print just how the graver should be held,  but a little experiment will suffice to teach the proper position. The  best indication that a graver is doing its work properly, is the fact  that the chips come away in long spiral coils. Aim to see how light a cut  you can make rather than how heavy. Never use force in removing the  material, but depend entirely upon the keenness of the cutting edges.  Never use the point of the graver, except where you are compelled to, but  rather use the right or left hand cutting edges. By following out this  rule you will find that your work, when left by the graver, requires  little or no finishing up, except at the pivots. At _B_, Fig. 14, is  shown the correct manner of applying the graver when turning a pivot.  Hold the graver nearly on a line with the axis of the lathe and catching  a chip at the extreme end of the pivot with the back edge of the graver,  push slightly forward and at the same time roll the graver towards you  and it will give the pivot the desired conical form. By keeping the  graver on a line with the length of the pivot, all the force applied is  simply exerted in the direction of the chuck, and does not tend to spring  the pivot, as it would were the extreme point applied, as in Fig. 13.  When we come to such places as the shoulder of the back slope, the seat  for the roller, balance, etc., we must necessarily use the point of the  graver.    [Illustration: _Fig. 14._]          CHAPTER V.      In chapter IV I called attention to the right and wrong way of holding  the graver while using the extreme point, and also the correct manner of  applying the graver in turning conical pivots. I also called attention to  the fact that it was well to only use the point of the graver where  positively necessary, as in the back slope of the pivot, etc. In turning  the seat for the balance, as indicated at A, Fig. 15, the graver A, Fig.  1, or a similar one as shown at B, Fig. 15, should be used. The slope at  C should now be turned. In turning the pivot and seat for the roller, you  should leave them slightly larger than required, to allow for the  grinding and polishing which is to follow. No definite amount can be left  for this purpose, because the amount left for polishing depends entirely  on how smoothly your turning has been done. If it has been done  indifferently, you may have to allow considerable for grinding and  polishing before all the graver marks are removed, while, on the  contrary, if the work has been performed with care, very little will have  to be removed. Avoid the use of the pivot file by performing your work  properly to start with.    [Illustration: _Fig. 15._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 16._]    For grinding, bell-metal or soft iron slips are desirable, and the  grinding is effected by means of oil stone powder and oil. Two slips of  metal similar in shape to A and B, Fig. 16, are easily made, and will be  found very useful. A is for square pivots, etc., while B is used for  conical pivots. These slips should be dressed with a dead smooth file,  the filing to be done crosswise, to hold the oil stone powder and oil.  During the operation of grinding, the lathe should be run at a high speed  and the slips applied to the work lightly, squarely and carefully. The  polishing is effected by means of diamantine and alcohol. After the work  is brought to a smooth gray surface, slips of boxwood of the shape shown  in Fig. 16 should be substituted for the metal slips. Oil stone slips are  sometimes used in lieu of metal ones, but they soon get out of shape and  are troublesome to care for on this account. All things considered, there  is nothing better for polishing than a slip or file made of agate, say  one inch long, one-quarter inch wide and one-eighth inch thick. A slip of  this kind can be obtained from any lapidary, and after grinding with  emery and water until the surface has a very fine grain, it should be  mounted by fastening with cement into a brass socket and this is then  inserted into a small wooden handle, as shown in Fig. 17. The agate slip  should be ground to about the shape of B, Fig. 16, so that one side can  be used for square corners and the other for conical pivots. The final  polish can soon be imparted by means of a small boxwood slip, or  flattened peg-wood, and diamantine and alcohol. Never try to bring out  the final polish until you are satisfied that all graver marks have been  ground out, otherwise you will simply have to go all over the work again.    [Illustration: _Fig. 17._]    When the staff is finished from the lower pivot to the seat of the  balance, the upper part should be roughed out nearly to size and then cut  off preparatory to finishing the top part.    Attention was previously called to the fact that the majority of  watchmakers prefer to finish all the lower portion of the staff first,  notwithstanding the fact that there are numerous advantages to be gained  by proceeding to first finish up the upper portion. We have now reached  the point where the wax chuck must be used, and perhaps these advantages  may be now more clearly defined. In order that the two procedures may be  more distinctly shown, illustrations of both methods are here given.  Fig. 18 shows the popular method, the lower portion of the staff being  all completed and fastened by means of wax, in the wax chuck. Fig. 19  shows the opposite course of procedure. In both illustrations the lines  indicate the amount of wax applied to hold the work. It will be noted  that in Fig. 18 the hub of the staff is enclosed in the wax very much as  a cork is fitted into a bottle, while in Fig. 19 the hub is reversed,  just as a cork would appear were the larger portion within the bottle and  the smaller portion protruding through the neck. A study of the diagram  will readily show that in Fig. 19 the staff is held more rigidly in place  and that a greater bulk of the work is enclosed in the wax than in Fig.  18, although there is less wax used in the former than in the latter.    [Illustration: _Fig. 18._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 19._]    Before proceeding to set the staff in the wax, it is necessary to make  some measurements to determine its full length. Remove both cap jewels  and screw the balance cock in place. Examine the cock and see if it has  at any time been bent up or down or punched to raise or lower it. If so,  rectify the error by straightening it and then put it in place. Now with  a degree gauge, or calipers, proceed to take the distance between the  outer surfaces of the hole jewels and shorten the staff to the required  length. Do not remove too much, but leave the staff a little long rather  than cut it too short, as the length can be shortened later.    [Illustration: _Fig. 20._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 21._]    A very handy tool for the purpose of making these length measurements can  be constructed by adding a stop screw to the common double calipers as  shown in Fig. 20. The improvement consists in the fact that they can be  opened to remove from the work and closed again at exactly the same  place, so that an accurate measurement can be made. The all-important  point in the use of wax chucks is to get a perfect center. If you are not  careful you are liable to leave a small projection in the center as shown  at A, Fig. 21. The ordinary wax chuck cannot be unscrewed from the  spindle and restored to its proper place again with anything like a  certainty of its being exactly true, and if you insist on doing this  there is no remedy left but finding a new center each time. It will be  found more satisfactory and economical in the long run to have a  permanent chuck for a wax chuck and you will then have no necessity for  removing the brass chuck.    The center, or cone for the reception of the pivot, should be turned out  with the graver at an angle of about 60 deg. and such a graver as is shown at  B, Fig. 1, will answer admirably for this purpose. After you have  carefully centered your wax chuck, place a small alcohol lamp under the  chuck and heat it until the wax will just become fluid and yet not be hot  enough to burn the wax. Revolve the lathe slowly and insert the staff so  that the pivot rests squarely and firmly in the center. Now re-heat the  chuck carefully in order that the wax may adhere firmly to the staff,  keeping the lathe revolving meanwhile, but not so fast that the wax will  be drawn from the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#4)"],[1,"!\" Was ever a woman so blest in privilege--to be the near, dear  friend of Franz Liszt and hear him play the music of Richard Wagner from  the manuscript, and then add her precious word of appreciation for the  work of the weary exile! The quotation given is only a sample of the  messages that Liszt was constantly sending to his exiled friend. And we  must understand that at this time Liszt had a world-wide reputation as  a composer himself, and was the foremost pianist of his time. And  Wagner--Wagner was only an obscure dreamer, with a penchant for erratic  music!    The \"Lohengrin\" was produced at Weimar under the leadership of Liszt,  but even his magic name could not make the people believe--the critics  had their way and wrote it down.    Yet Liszt lived to see the name of Wagner proclaimed as the greatest  contemporary name in music; and he was too great and good to allow  jealousy to enter his great soul. Yet he knew that as a composer his own  work was quite lost in the shadow of the reputation of his friend. At a  banquet given in Munich in Eighteen Hundred Eighty-one in honor of  Wagner, Liszt said, \"I ask no remembrance for myself or my work beyond  this: Franz Liszt was the loved and loving friend of Wagner, and played  his scores with tear-filled eyes; and knew the Heaven-born quality of  the man when all the world seemed filled with doubt.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Among men of worth, no man of his time was more thoroughly hated,  detested and denounced than Richard Wagner. Before he became an anarch  of art, he was singled out for distinction by royalty and a price was  placed upon his head. He escaped, and for ten years lived in exile, his  sole offense being that he lifted up his voice for liberty.    That is the only thing worth lifting up your voice, or pen, or sword  for. The men who live in history are the men who have made freedom's  fight--there is no other. These men fought for us, and some of them died  for us--Socrates, Jesus, Savonarola, John Brown, Lincoln--saviors  all--they died that we might live.    Instead of dying for us, Wagner lived for us, but he had to run away in  order to do it. There, in exile--in Switzerland--he wrote many of his  most sublime scores, and these he did not hear played till long years  after, for although the man could compose, he could not execute. The  music was in his brain and he could not get it out at his  finger-tips--for him the piano was mute. So now and again Franz Liszt  would come and play for him the scores he had never heard, and tears of  joy would flow down his fine face; then he would stand on his head, walk  on his hands and shout for pure gladness.    All this, I will admit, was not very dignified.    Ostracism, exile, hatred, and stupid misunderstanding did not suppress  Wagner. In his work he is often severe, stern, tragic, but the man  himself bubbled with good-cheer. He made foolish puns, and routed the  serious ones of earth by turning their arguments into airy jests. If in  those early days he had been caught and carried in the death-tumbrel to  the Place of the Skull, he would have remarked with Mercutio, \"This is a  grave subject.\"    Finally, public opinion relaxed, and Wagner found his way back to  Germany. He settled at the town of Bayreuth, and very slowly it dawned  upon the thinking few that at Bayreuth there lived a Man.    Among the very first who made this discovery was one Friedrich  Nietzsche, an idealist, a dreamer, a thinker, and a revolutionary.  Nietzsche was an honest man of marked intellect, whose nerves were worn  to the quick by the pretense of the times--the mad race for place and  power--the hypocrisy and phariseeism that he saw sitting in high places.  He longed to live a life of genuineness--to be, not to seem. And so he  had wandered here and there, footsore, weary, searching for peace,  scourged forever by the world's displeasure.    The trouble was, of course, that Nietzsche didn't have anything the  world wanted. In the time of the Crusaders, the tired children would ask  at night-time, when the tents were pitched, \"Is this Jerusalem?\"    And the only answer was: \"Jerusalem is not yet! Jerusalem is not yet!\"    In Wagner, Nietzsche felt that at last he had found the Moses who would  lead the people out of captivity, into the Promised Land of Celestial  Art.    Nietzsche came and heard the Wagnerian music and was caught as flotsam  in its whirling eddies. He read everything that Wagner had written, and  having come within the gracious sunshine of the great man's presence, he  rushed to his garret and in white heat wrote the most appreciative  criticism of Wagner and his work that has ever, even yet, been penned.  This booklet, \"Wagner at Bayreuth,\" is a masterpiece of insight and  erudition, written by a man of imagination, who saw and felt, and knew  how to mold his feelings into words--words that burn. It is a rhapsody  of appreciation.    Art is more a matter of heart than of head.    The book had a wide circulation, helped on, they do say, by the Master  himself, who confessed that in the main the work rang true.    The publication of the book sort of linked these two men, Wagner and  Nietzsche. The disciple sat at the feet of the elder man, and vowed he  would be in literature what Wagner was in music. He gazed on him, fed on  him, quoted him, waiting in patience for the pearls of thought.    Now Wagner was a natural man--a natural son of God. He had the desires,  appetites and ambitions of a man. If he voiced great thoughts and wrote  great scores, he did these things in a mood--and never knew how. At  times he was coarse, perverse, irritable.    The awful, serious, sober ways of Nietzsche began to pall on Wagner--he  would run away when he saw him coming, for Nietzsche had begun to give  advice about how Wagner should regenerate the race, and also conduct  himself. Now Richard Wagner had no intention of setting the world  straight--he wanted to express himself, that was all, and to make enough  money so he could be free to come and go as he chose.    Once, at a picnic, Wagner climbed a tree and cawed like a crow; then  hooted like an owl; he ate tarts out of a tin dish with a knife; a  little later he stood on his head and yelled like a Congo chief. When  Nietzsche tearfully interposed, Wagner told him to go and get  married--marry the first woman who was fool enough to have him--she  would relieve him of some of his silliness.    Shortly after this, the great Wagner festival came on, and Bayreuth was  filled with visitors who had read Nietzsche's book, and bought  excursion-tickets to Bayreuth.    Wagner was over his ears in work--an orchestra of three hundred players  to manage, new music to arrange, besides the humdrum, but necessary,  work of feeding and housing and caring for the throng. Of course he did  not do all the work, but the responsibility was his.    In this rush of work, Nietzsche was dropped out of sight--there was no  time now for long conferences on the Over-Soul and Music of the Future.    Nietzsche was snubbed. He went off to his garret and wrote a scathing  criticism on the work of Richard Wagner. This divine music was not for  the intellectual few at all--it was getting popular and it was getting  bad. Wagner was insincere--commercial--a charlatan.    Nietzsche was no longer interested in Wagner--he was interested only in  Nietzsche.    Literary men do not quarrel more than other men--it only seems as if  they did. This is because your writer uses his kazoo in getting even  with his supposed enemy--he flings the rhetorical stinkpot with  precision, and his grievances come into a prominence all out of keeping  with their importance.    In Eighteen Hundred Eighty-eight, Nietzsche issued his little book, \"The  Fall of Wagner.\"    After a person has greatly praised another, and wishes to say something  particularly unkind about him, one horn of the dilemma must be taken. If  you admit you were wrong in the first conclusion, you lay yourself open  to the suspicion that you are also wrong in the second--that you are one  who makes snap judgments. The safer way then is to cling close to the  presumption of your own infallibility, without, of course, actually  stating it, and claim that your idol has changed, backslidden--fallen.  This then lends an aura of virtue to your action, as it shows a  wholesome desire on your part not to associate with the base person,  and also an altruistic wish to warn the world so it shall not be undone  by him.    Of all the bitter, unkind and malicious things ever uttered against  Wagner, none contains more free alkali than the booklet by Nietzsche.    Nietzsche, not being satisfied with an attack on Wagner's art, also made  a few flings at his pedigree, and declared that the Master's real name  was not Wagner: this was his mother's name, he being a natural son of  Ludwig Geyer, the poet--the Jew. What this has to do with Tannhauser,  Tristan and Isolde, the Ring, Lohengrin, and Parsifal, Nietzsche does  not explain. In any event, the information about Wagner's birth comes  with very bad grace from an avowed enemy, who practically admits that he  got the facts, in confidence, from Wagner himself. Neither does  Nietzsche, the freethinking radical, recognize that good men have long  ceased taunting other men concerning their parentage, or boasting of  their own.    A man is what he is; and the word \"illegitimate\" is not in God's  vocabulary, since He smiles on love-children as on none other. If you  know history, you know this: that into their keeping God has largely  given the beauty, talent, energy, strength, skill and power, as well as  that divinity which confuses its possessor with Deity Incarnate.    Wagner might have replied to Nietzsche in kind, and pointed him out as  the product of \"tired sheets,\" to use the phrase of Shakespeare. Wagner  might have said, \"Yes, I am a member of that elect class to which belong"]]]
