There is a great deal of difference in the make, not  only of the several kinds of instruments, but even among those of the  same name. The syringa, for example, has sometimes four, and sometimes  more pipes, as high as the twelve. The same variety of strings may be  observed on their harps, and of stops on their tibiae, which shows the  little foundation that such writers have gone upon, who, from a verse  perhaps in Virgil's Eclogues, or a short passage in a classic author,  have been so very nice in determining the precise shape of the ancient  musical instruments, with the exact number of their pipes, strings, and  stops....    Tho the statues that have been found among the ruins of old Rome are  already very numerous, there is no question but posterity will have the  pleasure of seeing many noble pieces of sculpture which are still  undiscovered; for, doubtless, there are greater treasures of this nature  under ground, than what are yet brought to light.[5] They have often dug  into lands that are described in old authors, as the places where such  particular statues or obelisks stood, and have seldom failed of success  in their pursuits. There are still many such promising spots of ground  that have never been searched into. A great part of the Palatine  mountain, for example, lies untouched, which was formerly the seat of  the imperial palace, and may be presumed to abound with more treasures  of this nature than any other part of Rome.    But whether it be that the richest of these discoveries fall into the  Pope's hands, or for some other reason, it is said that the Prince  Farnese, who is the present owner of this seat, will keep his own family  in the chair. There are undertakers in Rome who often purchase the  digging of fields, gardens, or vineyards, where they find any likelihood  of succeeding, and some have been known to arrive at great estates by  it. They pay according to the dimensions of the surface they are to  break up; and after having made essays into it, as they do for coal in  England, they rake into the most promising parts of it, tho they often  find, to their disappointment, that others have been beforehand with  them. However, they generally gain enough by the rubbish and bricks,  which the present architects value much beyond those of a modern make,  to defray the charges of their search.    I was shown two spaces of ground, where part of Nero's golden house  stood, for which the owner has been offered an extraordinary sum of  money. What encouraged the undertakers, are several very ancient trees,  which grow upon the spot, from whence they conclude that these  particular tracts of ground must have lain untouched for some ages. It  is pity there is not something like a public register, to preserve the  memory of such statues as have been found from time to time, and to mark  the particular places where they have been taken up, which would not  only prevent many fruitless searches for the future, but might often  give a considerable light into the quality of the place, or the design  of the statue.    But the great magazine for all kinds of treasure, is supposed to be the  bed of the Tiber. We may be sure, when the Romans lay under the  apprehensions of seeing their city sacked by a barbarous enemy, as they  have done more than once, that they would take care to bestow such of  their riches this way as could best bear the water, besides what the  insolence of a brutish conqueror may be supposed to have contributed,  who had an ambition to waste and destroy all the beauties of so  celebrated a city. I need not mention the old common-shore of Rome,  which ran from all parts of the town with the current and violence of an  ordinary river, nor the frequent inundations of the Tiber, which may  have swept away many of the ornaments of its banks, nor the several  statues that the Romans themselves flung into it, when they would  revenge themselves on the memory of an ill citizen, a dead tyrant, or a  discarded favorite.    At Rome they have so general an opinion of the riches of this river,  that the Jews have formerly proffered the Pope to cleanse it, so they  might have for their pains what they found in the bosom of it. I have  seen the valley near Ponte Molle, which they proposed to fashion into a  new channel for it, until they had cleared the old for its reception.  The Pope, however, would not comply with the proposal, as fearing the  heats might advance too far before they had finished their work, and  produce a pestilence among his people; tho I do not see why such a  design might not be executed now with as little danger as in Augustus's  time, were there as many hands employed upon it. The city of Rome would  receive a great advantage from the undertaking, as it would raise the  banks and deepen the bed of the Tiber, and by consequence free them from  those frequent inundations to which they are so subject at present; for  the channel of the river is observed to be narrower within the walls  than either below or above them.    Next to the statues, there is nothing in Rome more surprizing than that  amazing variety of ancient pillars of so many kinds of marble. As most  of the old statues may be well supposed to have been cheaper to their  first owners than they are to a modern purchaser, several of the pillars  are certainly rated at a much lower price at present than they were of  old. For not to mention what a huge column of granite, serpentine, or  porphyry must have cost in the quarry, or in its carriage from Egypt to  Rome, we may only consider the great difficulty of hewing it into any  form, and of giving it the due turn, proportion, and polish. The most  valuable pillars about Rome, for the marble of which they are made, are  the four columns of oriental jasper in St. Paulina's chapel at St.  Maria Maggiore; two of oriental granite in St. Pudenziana; one of  transparent oriental jasper in the Vatican library; four of Nero-Bianco,  in St. Cecilia Transtevere; two of Brocatello, and two of oriental agate  in Don Livio's palace; two of Giallo Antico in St. John Lateran, and two  of Verdi Antique in the Villa Pamphilia. These are all entire and solid  pillars, and made of such kinds of marble as are nowhere to be found but  among antiquities, whether it be that the veins of it are undiscovered,  or that they were quite exhausted upon the ancient buildings. Among  these old pillars, I can not forbear reckoning a great part of an  alabaster column, which was found in the ruins of Livia's portico. It is  of the color of fire, and may be seen over the high altar of St. Maria  in Campitello; for they have cut it into two pieces, and fixt it in the  shape of a cross in a hole of the wall that was made on purpose to  receive it; so that the light passing through it from without, makes it  look, to those who are in the church, like a huge transparent cross of  amber.          THE PALACE OF THE CAESARS[6]    BY RODOLFO LANCIANI      The Palatine hill became the residence of the Roman emperors, and the  center of the Roman Empire, not on account of its historical and  traditional associations with the foundation and first growth of the  city, nor because of its central and commanding position, but by a mere  accident. At daybreak on September 21st, of the year 63 B.C., Augustus  was born in this region, in a modest house, opening on the lane called  \"ad capita bubula,\" which led from the valley, where now the Coliseum  stands, up the slopes of the hill toward the modern church and convent  of St. Bonaventura.    This man, sent by God to change the condition of mankind and the state  of the world, this founder of an empire which is still practically in  existence,[7] never deserted the Palatine hill all through his eventful  career. From the lane \"ad capita bubula\" he moved to the house of  Calvus, the orator, at the northeast corner of the hill overlooking the  forum; and in process of time, having become absolute master of the  Roman Commonwealth, he settled finally on the top of the hill, having  purchased for his residence the house of Hortensius, a simple and  modest house, indeed, with columns of the commonest kind of stone,  pavements of rubble-work, and simple whitewashed walls.    Whether this selection of a site was made because the Palatine had long  before been the Faubourg St. Honore, the Belgravia of ancient Rome, is  difficult to determine. We know that the house of Hortensius, chosen by  Augustus, was surrounded by those of Clodius, Scaurus, Crassus, Caecina,  Sisenna, Flaccus, Catiline, and other members of the aristocracy. I am  persuaded, however, that the secret of the selection is to be found in  the simplicity, I will even say in the poverty, of the dwelling; in  fact, such extreme modesty is worthy of the good sense and the spirit of  moderation shown by Augustus throughout his career. He could very well  sacrifice appearances to the reality of an unbounded power. It is just,  at any rate, to recognize that even in his remotest resorts for  temporary rest and retirement from the cares of government, he led the  same kind of plain, modest life, spending all his leisure hours in  arranging his collections of natural history, more especially the  palaeo-ethnological or prehistoric, for which the ossiferous caverns of  the Island of Capri supplied him with abundant materials.    It was only after the victory of Actium that, finding himself master of  the world, he thought it expedient to give up, in a certain measure, his  former habits, and live in better style. Having bought through his  agents some of the aristocratic palaces adjoining the old house of  Hortensius, among them the historical palace of Catiline, he built a  new and very handsome residence, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18846"],[0,"Voodoo Planet (#4)"],[1,"with double pairs of curved fangs. The  black-and-white striped fur, the sharply pointed ears, were neither  canine nor feline, but a weird combination of the two.    Dane gabbled two trading formulas under his breath and tried to think of  the relation of Samantine rock coinage to galactic credits. Only this  time his defenses did not work. From between the two shuffling dancers  padded something on four feet. The canine-feline creature was more than  just a head; it was a loose-limbed, graceful body fully eight feet in  length, and the red eyes in the prick-eared head were those of a  confident killer. It walked without restraint, lazily, with arrogance,  its white-tufted tail swinging. And when it reached the mid-point of the  terrace, it flung up its head as if to challenge. But words issued from  between those curved fangs, words which Dane might not understand but  which undoubtedly held meaning for the men nodding in time to the  hypnotic cadence of that da--da--da....    \"Beautiful!\" Tau spoke in honest admiration, his own eyes almost as  feral as those of the talking beast as he leaned forward, his fists on  his knees.    Now the animal was dancing also, its paws following the pace set by the  masked attendants. It must be a man in an animal skin. But Dane could  hardly believe that. The illusion was too perfect. His own hands went to  the knife sheath at his belt. Out of deference to local custom they had  left their stun rods in the palace, but a belt knife was an accepted  article of apparel. Dane slid the blade out surreptitiously, setting its  point against the palm of his hand and jabbing painfully. This was  another of Tau's answers for breaking a spell. But the white and black  creature continued to dance; there was no blurring of its body lines  into those of a human being.    It sang on in a high-pitched voice, and Dane noted that those of the  audience nearest the stools where Asaki and the captain were seated now  watched the Chief Ranger and the space officer. He felt Tau tense beside  him.    \"Trouble coming....\" The warning from Tau was the merest thread of  sound. Dane forced himself to look away from the swaying cat-dog, to  watch instead the singers who were now furtively eying their lord and  his guest. The Terran knew that there were feudal bonds between the  Ranger and his men. But suppose this was a showdown between Lumbrilo and  Asaki--whose side would these men take?    He watched Captain Jellico's hand slide across his knee, his fingers  drop in touching distance of knife hilt. And the hand of the Chief  Ranger, hanging lax at his side, suddenly balled into a fist.    \"So!\" Tau expelled the word as a hiss. He moved with sure-footed speed.  Now he passed between the stools to confront the dancing cat-dog. Yet he  did not look at that weird creature and its attendants. Instead his arms  were flung high as if to ward off--or perhaps welcome--something on the  mountain side as he shouted:    \"_Hodi, eldama! Hodi!_\"    As one, those on the terrace turned, looked up toward the slope. Dane  was on his feet, holding his knife as he might a sword. Though of what  use its puny length would be against that huge bulk moving in slow  majesty toward them, he did not try to think.    Gray-dark trunk curled upward between great ivory tusks, ears went wide  as ponderous feet crunched volcanic soil. Tau moved forward, his hands  still upraised, clearly in greeting. That trunk touched skyward as if in  salute to the man who could be crushed under one foot.    \"_Hodi, eldama!_\" For the second time Tau hailed the monster elephant  and the trunk raised in silent greeting from one lord of an earth to  another he recognized as an equal. Perhaps it had been a thousand years  since man and elephant had stood so, and then there had been only war  and death between them. Now there was peace and a current of power  flowing from one to the other. Dane sensed this, saw the men on the  terrace likewise drawing back from the unseen tie between the medic and  the bull he had so clearly summoned.    Then Tau's upheld hands came together in a sharp clap and men held their  breath in wonder. Where the great bull had stood there was  nothing--except rocks in the sun.    As Tau swung around to face the cat-dog, that creature had no substance  either. For he fronted no animal but a man, a small, lean man whose lips  wrinkled back from his teeth in a snarl. His attendant priests fell  back, leaving the spaceman and the witch doctor alone.    \"Lumbrilo's magic is great,\" Tau said evenly. \"I hail Lumbrilo of  Khatka.\" His hand made the open-palmed salute of peace.    The snarl faded as the man brought his face under control. He stood  naked, but he was clothed in inherit dignity. And there was power with  that dignity, power and a pride before which even the more physically  impressive Chief Ranger might have to give place.    \"You have magic also, outlander,\" he replied. \"Where walks this  long-toothed shadow of yours now?\"    \"Where once the men of Khatka walked, Lumbrilo. For it was men of your  blood who long, long past hunted this shadow of mine and made its body  their prey.\"    \"So that it now might have a blood debt to settle with us, outlander?\"    \"That you said, not I, man of power. You have shown us one beast, I have  shown another. Who can say which of them is stronger when it issues  forth from the shadows?\"    Lumbrilo pattered forward, his bare feet making little sound on the  stones of the terrace. Now he was only an arm's-length away from the  medic.    \"You have challenged me, off-world man.\" Was that a question or a  statement? Dane wondered.    \"Why should I challenge you, Lumbrilo? To each race its own magic. I  come not to offer battle.\" His eyes held steady with the Khatkan's.    \"You have challenged me.\" Lumbrilo turned away and then looked back over  his shoulder. \"The strength you depend upon may become a broken staff,  off-worlder. Remember my words in the time when shadows become  substance, and substance the thinnest of shadows!\"          III      \"You are truly a man of power!\"    Tau shook his head in answer to that outburst from Asaki.    \"Not so, sir. Your Lumbrilo is a man of power. I drew upon his power and  you saw the results.\"    \"Deny it not! What we saw never walked this world.\"    Tau slung the strap of a trail bag over his shoulder. \"Sir, once men of  your blood, men who bred your race, hunted the elephant. They took his  tusks for their treasure, feasted upon his flesh--yes, and died beneath  the trampling of his feet when they were unlucky or unwary. So there is  that within you which can even now be awakened to remember _eldama_ in  his might when he was king of the herd and need fear nothing save the  spears and cunning of small, weak men. Lumbrilo had already awakened  your minds to see what he willed you to see.\"    \"How does he do this?\" asked the other simply. \"Is it magic that we see  not Lumbrilo but a lion before us?\"    \"He weaves his spell with the drums, with the chant, by the suggestion  his mind imposes upon yours. And, having woven his spell, he cannot  limit it to just the picture he suggests if ancient racial memories  raise another. I merely used the tools of Lumbrilo to show you yet  another picture your people once knew well.\"    \"And in so doing made an enemy.\" Asaki stood before a rack of very  modern weapons. Now he made his selection, a silver tube with a stock  curved to fit a man's shoulder. \"Lumbrilo will not forget.\"    Tau laughed shortly. \"No, but then I have merely done as you wished,  have I not, sir? I have focused on myself the enmity of a dangerous man,  and now you hope I shall be forced, in self-defense, to remove him from  your path.\"    The Khatkan turned slowly, resting the weapon across his forearm. \"I do  not deny that, spaceman.\"    \"Then matters here are indeed serious--\"    \"They are so serious,\" Asaki interrupted, speaking not only to Tau but  to the other off-worlders as well, \"that what happens now may mean the  end of the Khatka that I know. Lumbrilo is the most dangerous game I  have faced in a lifetime as a hunter. He goes, or we draw his fangs--or  else all that I am, all I have labored here to build, will be swept  away. To preserve this I will use any weapon.\"    \"And I am now your weapon, which you hope will be as successful as that  needler you are carrying.\" Tau laughed again, without much humor. \"Let  us hope I shall prove as effective.\"    Jellico moved out of the shadows. It was just after dawn, and the  grayness of the vanishing night still held in the corners of the armory.  Deliberately he took his own stand before the arms racks and chose a  short-barreled blaster. Only when its butt was cupped in his hand did he  glance at his host.    \"We came guesting, Asaki. We have eaten salt and bread under this roof.\"    \"On my body and my blood it is,\" returned the Khatkan grimly. \"I shall  go down to the blackness of Sabra before you do, if the flames of death  are against us.\" From his belt he flipped loose his knife and offered  the hilt to Jellico. \"My body for a wall between you and the dark,  Captain. But also understand this: to me, what I do now is greater than  the life of any one man. Lumbrilo and the evil behind him must be rooted  out. There was no trickery in my invitation!\"    They stood eye to eye, equal in height, in authority of person, and that  indefinable something which made them both masters in their own  different worlds. Then Jellico's hand went out, his fingertip flicked  the hilt of the bared blade.    \"There was no trickery,\" he conceded. \"I knew that your need was great  when you came to the _Queen_.\"    Since both the captain and Tau appeared to accept the situation, Dane,  not quite understanding it all, was prepared to follow their lead. And  for the moment they had nothing more in plan than to visit the Zoboru  preserve.    They went by flitter--Asaki, one of his Hunter pilots, and"]]]
