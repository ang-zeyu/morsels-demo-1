You have been writing to her  constantly for two years. She has come here specially to be near you.  You are her only friend in a new and strange country where she is many  thousand miles away from her own home. You gave her a cordial invitation  to England, and now, because she does not happen to realize your quite  unfounded expectations, you want to back out of all your obligations to  her. I thought you were a girl, Ulyth, who kept her promises.\"    Ulyth fingered the corner of the tablecloth nervously for a moment, then  she burst out:    \"I can't, Miss Bowes, I simply can't. If you knew how she grates upon  me! Oh, it's too much! I'd rather have a bear cub or a monkey for a  room-mate! Please, please don't make us stop together! If you won't move  her, move me! I'd sleep in an attic if I could have it to myself.\"    \"You must stay where you are until the end of the week. You owe that to  Rona, at any rate. Afterwards I shall not force you, but leave it to  your own good feeling. I want you to think over what I have been saying.  You can come on Sunday morning and tell me your decision.\"    \"I know what the answer will be,\" murmured Ulyth, as she went from the  room.    She was very angry with Miss Bowes, with Rona, and with herself for her  own folly.    \"It's ridiculous to expect me to take up this savage,\" she argued. \"And  too bad of Miss Bowes to make out that I'm breaking my word. Oh dear!  what am I to write home to Mother? How can I tell her? I believe I'll  just send her a picture post card, and only say Rona has come, and no  more. Miss Bowes has no right to coerce me. I'll make my own friends.  No, I've quite made up my mind she shan't cram Rona down my throat. To  have that awful girl eternally in my bedroom--I should die!\"    After all her heroics it was a terrible come-down for poor Ulyth now the  actual had taken the place of the sentimental. Her class-mates could not  forbear teasing her a little. It was too bad of them; but then they had  resented her entire pre-appropriation of the new-comer, and, moreover,  had one or two old scores from last term to pay off. Ulyth began to  detest the very name of \"the Prairie Flower\". She wondered how she could  ever have been so silly.    \"I ought to have been warned,\" she thought, trying to throw the blame on  to somebody else. \"No one ever suggested she'd be like this. The editor  of the magazine really shouldn't have persuaded us to write. It's all  his fault in the beginning.\"    Though the rest of the girls were scarcely impressed with Rona's  personality, they were not utterly repelled.    \"She's rather pretty,\" ventured Lizzie Lonsdale. \"Her eyes are the  bluest I've ever seen.\"    \"And her teeth are so white and even,\" added Beth Broadway. \"She looks  jolly when she smiles.\"    \"Perhaps she'll smarten up soon,\" suggested Addie Knighton. \"That blue  dress suits her; it just matches her eyes.\"    To Ulyth's fastidious taste Rona's clothes looked hopelessly ill-cut and  colonial, especially as her room-mate put them on anyhow, and seemed to  have no regard at all for appearances. A girl who did not mind whether  she looked really trim, spruce and smart, must indeed have spent her  life in the backwoods.    \"Didn't you even have a governess in New Zealand?\" she ventured one day.  She did not encourage Rona to talk, but for once her curiosity overcame  her dislike of the high-pitched voice.    \"Couldn't get one to stop up-country, where we were. Mrs. Barker, our  cowman's wife, looked after me ever since Mother died. She was the only  woman about the place. One of our farm helps taught me lessons. He was a  B.A. of Oxford, but down on his luck. Dad said I'd seem queer to English  girls. I don't know that I care.\"    Though Rona might not be possessed of the most delicate perceptions, she  nevertheless had common sense enough to realize that Ulyth did not  receive her with enthusiasm.    \"I suppose you're disappointed in me?\" she queried. \"Dad said you would  be, but I laughed at him. Pity if our ready-made friendship turned out a  misfit! I think you're no end! Dad said I'd got to copy you; it'll take  me all my time, I expect. Things are so different here from home.\"    Was there a suspicion of a choke in the words?    Ulyth had a sudden pang of compunction. Unwelcome as her companion was  to her, she did not wish to be brutal.    \"You mustn't get home-sick,\" she said hastily. \"You'll shake down here  in time. Everyone finds things strange at school just at first. I did  myself.\"    \"I guess you were never as much a fish out of water as me, though,\"  returned Rona, and went whistling down the passage.    Ulyth tried to dismiss her from her thoughts. She did not intend to  worry over Rona more than she could possibly help. Fortunately they were  not together in class, for Rona's entrance-examination papers had not  reached the standard of the Lower Fifth, and she had been placed in IV  B.    Ulyth was interested in her school-work. She stood well with her  teachers, and was an acknowledged force in her form. She came from a  very refined and cultured home, where intellectual interests were  cultivated both by father and mother. Her temperament was naturally  artistic; she was an omnivorous reader, and could devour anything in the  shape of literature that came her way. The bookcase in her dormitory was  filled with beautiful volumes, mostly Christmas and birthday gifts. She  rejoiced in their soft leather bindings or fine illustrations with a  true book-lover's enthusiasm. It was her pride to keep them in daintiest  condition. Dog-ears or thumb-marks were in her opinion the depths of  degradation. Ulyth had ambitions also, ambitions which she would not  reveal to anybody. Some day she planned to write a book of her own. She  had not yet fixed on a subject, but she had decided just what the cover  was to be like, with her name on it in gilt letters. Perhaps she might  even illustrate it herself, for her love of art almost equalled her love  of literature; but that was still in the clouds, and must wait till she  had chosen her plot. In the interim she wrote verses and short stories  for the school magazine, and her essays for Miss Teddington were  generally returned marked \"highly creditable\".    This term Ulyth intended to study hard. It was a promotion to be in the  Upper School; she was beginning several new subjects, and her interest  in many things was aroused. It would be a delightful autumn as soon as  she had got rid of this dreadful problem, at present the one serious  obstacle to her comfort. But in the meantime it was only Friday, and  till at least the following Monday she would be obliged to endure her  uncongenial presence in her bedroom.          CHAPTER III    Round the Camp-fire      It was the first Saturday of the term. So far the girls had been kept  busily occupied settling down to work in their fresh forms, and trying  to grow accustomed to Miss Teddington's new time-tables. Now, however,  they were free to relax and enjoy themselves in any way they chose. Some  were playing tennis, some had gone for a walk with Miss Moseley, a few  were squatting frog-like on boulders in the midst of the stream, and  others strolled under the trees in the grove.    \"Thank goodness the weather's behaving itself!\" said Mary Acton, who,  with a few other members of the Lower Fifth, was sitting on the trunk of  a fallen oak. \"Do you remember last council? It simply poured. The  thing's no fun if one can't have a real fire.\"    \"It'll burn first-rate to-night,\" returned Lizzie Lonsdale. \"There's a  little wind, and the wood'll be dry.\"    \"That reminds me I haven't found my faggot yet,\" said Beth Broadway  easily.    \"Girl alive! Then you'd better go and look for one, or you'll be all in  a scramble at the last!\"    \"Bother! I'm too comfy to move.\"    \"Nice Wood-gatherer you'll look if you come empty-handed!\"    \"I'd appropriate half your lot first, Lizzikins!\"    \"Would you, indeed? I'd denounce you, and you'd lose your rank and be  degraded to a candidate again.\"    \"Oh, you mean, stingy miser!\"    \"Not at all. It's the wise and foolish virgins over again. I shan't have  enough for myself and you. I've a lovely little stack--just enough for  one--reposing--no, I'd better not tell you where. Don't look so hopeful.  You're not to be trusted.\"    \"What are you talking about?\" asked Rona Mitchell, who had wandered up  to the group. \"Why are some of you picking up sticks? I saw a girl over  there with quite a bundle just now. You might tell me.\"    So far Rona had not been well received in her own form, IV B. She was  older than her class-mates, and they, instead of attempting to initiate  her into the ways of the Woodlands girls on this holiday afternoon, had  scuttled off and left her to fend for herself. She looked such an odd,  wistful, lonely figure that Lizzie Lonsdale's kind heart smote her. She  pushed the other girls farther along the tree-trunk till they made a  grudging space for the new-comer.    \"I'm a good hand at camp-fires, if you want any help,\" continued Rona,  seating herself with alacrity. \"I've made 'em by the dozen at home, and  cooked by them too. Just let me know where you want it, and I'll set to  work.\"    \"You wouldn't be allowed,\" said Beth bluntly. \"This fire is a very  special thing. Only Wood-gatherers may bring the fuel. No one else is  eligible.\"    \"Why on earth not?\"    \"Oh, I can't bother to explain now! It would take too long. You'll find  out to-night. Girls, I'm going in!\"    \"Turn up here at dusk if you want to know, and bring a cup with you,\"  suggested Lizzie, with a half-ashamed effort at friendliness, as she  followed her chums.    \"You bet I'll turn up! Rather!\"    That evening, just after sunset, little groups of girls began to collect  round an open green space in the glade. They came quietly and with a  certain sense of discipline.

In the convulsions  of our own time, the moneyed interests have been on one side, and the  population without money on the other. But in the first and greatest  convulsion, those who had nothing to lose found their animosities shared  by those who had had something to lose, and had lost it.    Deliberative assemblies, then, had been tried, and ministers had been  tried; both had failed, and there was no other device left, except one  which was destructive to absolute monarchy. Lewis the Sixteenth was in  1789 in much the same case as that of the King of England in 1640.  Charles had done his best to raise money without any parliament for  twelve years: he had lost patience with the Short Parliament; finally,  he was driven without choice or alternative to face as he best could the  stout resolution and the wise patriotism of the Long Parliament. Men  sometimes wonder how it was that Lewis, when he came to find the  National Assembly unmanageable, and discovering how rapidly he was  drifting towards the thunders of the revolutionary cataract, did not  break up a Chamber over which neither the court, nor even a minister so  popular as Necker, had the least control. It is a question whether the  sword would not have broken in his hand. Even supposing, however, that  the army would have consented to a violent movement against the  Assembly, the King would still have been left in the same desperate  straits from which he had looked to the States-General to extricate him.  He might perhaps have dispersed the Assembly; he could not disperse debt  and deficit. Those monsters would have haunted him as implacably as  ever. There was no new formula of exorcism, nor any untried enchantment.  The success of violent designs against the National Assembly, had  success been possible, could, after all, have been followed by no other  consummation than the relapse of France into the raging anarchy of  Poland, or the sullen decrepitude of Turkey.    This will seem to some persons no better than fatalism. But, in truth,  there are two popular ways of reading the history of events between 1789  and 1794, and each of them seems to us as bad as the other. According to  one, whatever happened in the Revolution was good and admirable, because  it happened. According to the other, something good and admirable was  always attainable, and, if only bad men had not interposed, always ready  to happen. Of course, the only sensible view is that many of the  revolutionary solutions were detestable, but no other solution was  within reach. This is undoubtedly the best of possible worlds; if the  best is not so good as we could wish, that is the fault of the  possibilities. Such a doctrine is neither fatalism nor optimism, but an  honest recognition of long chains of cause and effect in human affairs.    The great gathering of chosen men was first called States-General; then  it called itself National Assembly; it is commonly known in history as  the Constituent Assembly. The name is of ironical association, for the  constitution which it framed after much travail endured for no more than  a few months. Its deliberations lasted from May 1789 until September  1791. Among its members were three principal groups. There was, first, a  band of blind adherents of the old system of government with all or most  of its abuses. Second, there was a Centre of timid and one-eyed men, who  were for transforming the old absolutist system into something that  should resemble the constitution of our own country. Finally, there was  a Left, with some differences of shade, but all agreeing in the  necessity of a thorough remodelling of every institution and most of the  usages of the country. 'Silence, you thirty votes!' cried Mirabeau one  day, when he was interrupted by the dissents of the Mountain. This was  the original measure of the party that in the twinkling of an eye was to  wield the destinies of France. In our own time we have wondered at the  rapidity with which a Chamber that was one day on the point of bringing  back the grandnephew of Lewis the Sixteenth, found itself a little later  voting that Republic which has since been ratified by the nation, and  has at this moment the ardent good wishes of every enlightened  politician in Europe. In the same way it is startling to think that  within three years of the beheading of Lewis the Sixteenth, there was  probably not one serious republican in the representative assembly of  France. Yet it is always so. We might make just the same remark of the  House of Commons at Westminster in 1640, and of the Assembly of  Massachusetts or of New York as late as 1770. The final flash of a long  unconscious train of thought or intent is ever a surprise and a shock.  It is a mistake to set these swift changes down to political levity;  they were due rather to quickness of political intuition. It was the  King's attempt at flight in the summer of 1791 that first created a  republican party. It was that unhappy exploit, and no theoretical  preferences, that awoke France to the necessity of choosing between the  sacrifice of monarchy and the restoration of territorial aristocracy.    Political intuition was never one of Robespierre's conspicuous gifts.  But he had a doctrine that for a certain time served the same purpose.  Rousseau had kindled in him a fervid democratic enthusiasm, and had  penetrated his mind with the principle of the Sovereignty of the People.  This famous dogma contained implicitly within it the more indisputable  truth that a society ought to be regulated with a view to the happiness  of the people. Such a principle made it easier for Robespierre to  interpret rightly the first phases of the revolutionary movement. It  helped him to discern that the concentrated physical force of the  populace was the only sure protection against a civil war. And if a  civil war had broken out in 1789, instead of 1793, all the advantages of  authority would have been against the popular party. The first  insurrection of Paris is associated with the harangue of Camille  Desmoulins at the Palais Royal, with the fall of the Bastille, with the  murder of the governor, and a hundred other scenes of melodramatic  horror and the blood-red picturesque. The insurrection of the Fourteenth  of July 1789 taught Robespierre a lesson of practical politics, which  exactly fitted in with his previous theories. In his resentment against  the oppressive disorder of monarchy and feudalism, he had accepted the  counter principle that the people can do no wrong, and nobody of sense  now doubts that in their first great act the people of Paris did what  was right. Six days after the fall of the Bastille, the Centre were for  issuing a proclamation denouncing popular violence and ordering rigorous  vigilance. Robespierre was then so little known in the Assembly that  even his name was usually misspelt in the journals. From his obscure  bench on the Mountain he cried out with bitter vehemence against the  proposed proclamation:--'Revolt! But this revolt is liberty. The battle  is not at its end. Tomorrow, it may be, the shameful designs against us  will be renewed; and who will there then be to repulse them, if  beforehand we declare the very men to be rebels, who have rushed to  arms for our protection and safety?' This was the cardinal truth of the  situation. Everybody knows Mirabeau's saying about Robespierre:--'That  man will go far: he believes every word that he says!' This is much, but  it is only half. It is not only that the man of power believes what he  says; what he believes must fit in with the facts and with the demands  of the time. Now Robespierre's firmness of conviction happened at this  stage to be rightly matched by his clearness of sight.    It is true that a passionate mob, its unearthly admixture of laughter  with fury, of vacancy with deadly concentration, is as terrible as some  uncouth antediluvian, or the unfamiliar monsters of the sea, or one of  the giant plants that make men shudder with mysterious fear. The history  of our own country in the eighteenth century tells of the riots against  meeting-houses in Doctor Sacheverell's time, and the riots against  papists and their abettors in Lord George Gordon's time, and  Church-and-King riots in Doctor Priestley's time. It would be too  daring, therefore, to maintain that the rabble of the poor have any more  unerring political judgment than the rabble of the opulent. But, in  France in 1789, Robespierre was justified in saying that revolt meant  liberty. If there had been no revolt in July, the court party would have  had time to mature their infatuated designs of violence against the  Assembly. In October these designs had come to life again. The royalists  at Versailles had exultant banquets, at which, in the presence of the  Queen, they drank confusion to all patriots, and trampled the new emblem  of freedom passionately underfoot. The news of this odious folly soon  travelled to Paris. Its significance was speedily understood by a  populace whose wits were sharpened by famine. Thousands of fire-eyed  women and men tramped intrepidly out towards Versailles. If they had  done less, the Assembly would have been dispersed or arbitrarily  decimated, even though such a measure would certainly have left the  government in desperation.    At that dreadful moment of the Sixth of October, amid the slaughter of  guards and the frantic yells of hatred against the Queen, it is no  wonder that some were found to urge the King to flee to Metz. If he had  accepted the advice, the course of the Revolution would have been  different; but its march would have been just as irresistible, for  revolution lay in the force of a hundred combined circumstances. Lewis,  however, rejected these counsels, and suffered the mob to carry him in  bewildering procession to his capital and his prison. That great man who  was watching French affairs with such consuming"]]]
