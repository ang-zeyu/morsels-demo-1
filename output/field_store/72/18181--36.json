In the ordinary sense  of the word Tradition they may; but in Muslim Theology the term Hadis,  which we translate Tradition, has a special meaning. It is applied only to  the sayings of the Prophet, not to those of some uninspired divine or  teacher. The Wahhabis reject the Traditions handed down by men who lived  after the time of the Companions, but the Hadis, embodying the sayings of  the Prophet, they, in common with _all_ Muslim sects, hold to be an  inspired revelation of God's will to men. It would be as reasonable to say  that Protestants reject the four Gospels as to say that the Wahhabis reject  Tradition.[15] An orthodox Muslim places the Gospels in the same rank as  the Hadis, that is, he looks upon them as a record of what Jesus said and  did handed down to us by His Companions. \"In the same way as other Prophets  received their books under the form of ideas, so our Prophet has in the  same way received a great number of communications which are found in the  collections of the {12} Traditions (Ahadis).[16] This shows that the Sunnat  must be placed on a level with the Jewish and Christian Scriptures; whilst  the Quran is a revelation superior to them all. To no sect of Musalmans is  the Quran alone the rule of faith. The Shia'hs, it is true, reject the  Sunnat, but they have in their own collection of Traditions an exact  equivalent.    The nature of the inspiration of the Sunnat and its authoritative value are  questions of the first importance, whether Islam is viewed from a  theological or a political stand-point.    \"Muhammad said that seventy-three sects would arise, of whom only one would  be worthy of Paradise. The Companions inquired which sect would be so  highly favoured. The Prophet replied:--'The one which remains firm in my  way and in that of my friends.' It is certain that this must refer to the  Ahl-i-Sunnat wa Jama'at.\" (Sunnis.)[17]    It is laid down as a preliminary religious duty that obedience should be  rendered to the Sunnat of the Prophet. Thus in the fourth Sura of the Quran  it is written: \"O true believers! obey God and obey the apostle.\" \"We have  not sent any apostle but that he might be obeyed by the permission of God.\"  From these and similar passages the following doctrine is deduced: \"It is  plain that the Prophet (on whom and on whose descendants be the mercy and  peace of God!) is free from sin in what he ordered to be done, and in what  he prohibited, in all his words and acts; for were it otherwise how could  obedience rendered to him be accounted as obedience paid to God?\"[18]  Believers are exhorted to render obedience to God by witnessing to His  divinity, and to the Prophet by bearing witness to his prophetship; this is  a sign of love, and love is the cause of nearness to God. The Prophet  himself is reported to have {13} said, \"Obey me that God may regard you as  friends.\" From this statement the conclusion is drawn that \"the love of God  (to man) is conditional on obedience to the Prophet.\" Belief in and  obedience to the Prophet are essential elements of the true faith, and he  who possesses not both of these is in error.[19]    In order to show the necessity of this obedience, God is said to have  appointed Muhammad as the Mediator between Himself and man. In a lower  sense, believers are to follow the \"Sunnat\" of the four Khalifs, Abu Bakr,  Omar, Osman, and 'Ali, who are true guides to men.    To the Muslim all that the Prophet did was perfectly in accord with the  will of God. Moral laws have a different application when applied to him.  His jealousy, his cruelty to the Jewish tribes, his indulgence in  licentiousness, his bold assertion of equality with God as regards his  commands, his every act and word, are sinless, and a guide to men as long  as the world shall last. It is easy for an apologist for Muhammad to say  that this is an accretion, something which engrafted itself on to a simpler  system. It is no such thing. It is rather one of the essential parts of the  system. Let Muhammad be his own witness:--\"He who loves not my Sunnat is  not my follower.\" \"He who revives my Sunnat revives me, and will be with me  in Paradise.\" \"He who in distress holds fast to the Sunnat will receive the  reward of a hundred martyrs.\" As might be expected, the setting up of his  own acts and words as an infallible and unvarying rule of faith accounts  more than anything else for the immobility of the Muhammadan world, for it  must be always remembered that in Islam Church and State are one. The Arab  proverb, \"Al mulk wa din tawamini\"--country and religion are twins--is the  popular form of expressing the unity of Church and State. {14} To the mind  of the Musalman the rule of the one is the rule of the other,--a truth  sometimes forgotten by politicians who look hopefully on the reform of  Turkey or the regeneration of the House of Osman. The Sunnat as much as the  Quran covers all law, whether political, social, moral, or religious. A  modern writer who has an intimate acquaintance with Islam says:--\"If Islam  is to be a power for good in the future, it is imperatively necessary to  cut off the social system from the religion. The difficulty lies in the  close connection between the religious and social ordinances in the Kuran,  the two are so intermingled that it is hard to see how they can be  disentangled without destroying both.\" I believe this to be impossible, and  the case becomes still more hopeless when we remember that the same remark  would apply to the Sunnat. To forget this is to go astray, for Ibn Khaldoun  distinctly speaks of \"the Law derived from the Quran and the Sunnat,\" of  the \"maxims of Musalman Law based on the text of the Quran and the teaching  of the Traditions.\"[20]    The Prophet had a great dread of all innovation. The technical term for  anything new is \"bida't,\" and of it, it is said: \"Bida't is the changer of  Sunnat.\" In other words, if men seek after things new, if fresh forms of  thought arise, and the changing condition of society demands new modes of  expression for the Faith, or new laws to regulate the community, if in  internals or externals, any new thing (bida't) is introduced, it is to be  shunned. The law as revealed in the Quran and the Sunnat is perfect.  Everything not in accordance with the precepts therein contained is  innovation, and all innovation is heresy. Meanwhile some {15} \"bida't\" is  allowable, such as the teaching of etymology and syntax, the establishment  of schools, guest-houses, &c., which things did not exist in the time of  the Prophet; but it is distinctly and clearly laid down that compliance  with the least Sunnat (_i.e._ the obeying the least of the orders of the  Prophet, however trivial) is far better than doing some new thing, however  advantageous and desirable it may be.    There are many stories which illustrate the importance the Companions of  the Prophet attached to Sunnat. \"The Khalif Omar looked towards the black  stone at Mecca, and said, 'By God, I know that thou art only a stone, and  canst grant no benefit, canst do no harm. If I had not known that the  Prophet kissed thee, I would not have done so, but on account of that I do  it.'\" Abdullah-Ibn-'Umr was seen riding his camel round and round a certain  place. In answer to an inquiry as to his reason for so doing he said: \"I  know not, only I have seen the Prophet do so here.\" Ahmad-Ibn-Hanbal, one  of the four great Imams, and the founder of the Hanbali school of  interpretation, is said to have been appointed on account of the care with  which he observed the Sunnat. One day when sitting in an assembly he alone  of all present observed some formal custom authorised by the practice of  the Prophet. Gabriel at once appeared and informed him that now, and on  account of his act, he was appointed an Imam.[21] In short, it is  distinctly laid down that the best of all works is the following of the  practice of Muhammad. The essence of religion has been stated by a learned  theologian to consist of three things: first, to follow the Prophet in  morals and in acts; secondly, to eat only lawful food; thirdly, to be  sincere in all actions.    {16}    The Sunnat is now known to Musalmans through the collections of Traditions  gathered together by the men whose names they now bear. The whole are  called Sihah-Sittah, or \"six correct books.\" Not one of these collectors  flourished until the third century of the Hijra, and so, as may be easily  supposed, their work has not passed unchallenged. There is by no means an  absolute consensus of opinion among the Sunnis as to the exact value of  each Tradition, yet all admit that a 'genuine Tradition' must be obeyed.  Whether the Prophet spoke what in the Traditions is recorded as spoken by  him under the influence of the highest kind of inspiration is, as will be  shown in the next chapter, a disputed point; but it matters little.  Whatever may have been the degree, it was according to Muslim belief a real  inspiration, and thus his every act and word became a law as binding upon  his followers as the example of Christ is upon Christians.    The Shia'hs do not acknowledge the Sihah-Sittah, the six correct books of  the Sunnis, but it by no means follows that they reject Tradition. They  have five books of Traditions, the earliest of which was compiled by Abu  Ja'far Muhammad A.H. 329, or a century later than the Sahih-i-Bukhari, the  most trustworthy of the Sunni set. Thus all Musalman sects accept the first  and second ground of the faith--the Quran and the Sunnat--as the inspired  will of God; the Shia'hs substituting in the place of the Traditions on  which the Sunnat is based, a collection of their own. What it is important  to maintain is this, that the Quran alone is to no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#4)"],[1,"to secure the making of good malt. Each loft should have uprights under  the centre of all the beams from end to end of the house; this  precaution is necessary to prevent the swagging or cracking of the  upper floor. Trap doors should be placed at proper distances in the  upper malt-house floor, to facilitate the shovelling of the couches  from the lower to the upper floor. A well constructed kiln is of great  importance to insure a successful result to the malting operation, and  if large enough to dry off each steep at _one cast_ so much the better.  The most approved covering for malt kilns in England (although not the  most economical) is hair cloth, as it is asserted, it dries the palest  and sweetest malt. Many prefer tiles, as less expensive and more  lasting; others dry on boarded floors, and if this construction be well  managed, I take it to be as good as any, and much cheaper than either  tiles or hair cloth. (See description page 23.) The dropping room for  receiving the malt as it comes off the kiln may be constructed  different ways; but I take it that a ground floor covered with a two  inch plank well jointed, and properly laid, is preferable to a loft for  keeping malt, and in this situation might be heaped to any depth  without injury or danger of breaking down. Malt thus kept, if well  dried before coming off the kiln, is never in danger of heating or  getting slack. The common mode of keeping malt is in bins situated on  upper lofts, often injured by leaks from the roof, and at all times  liable to the depredations of rats, which in the other way can be  effectually guarded against, and is a highly important object of  precaution to be taken by the brewer. Should weevils at any time get  into, or generate in your malt, which is common when held over beyond  twelve or eighteen months, the simplest and easiest way of getting rid  of them, is to place four or five lobsters on your heap of malt, the  smell of which will soon compel the weevils to quit the malt, and take  refuge on the walls, from which they can be swept with a broom into a  sheet or table cloth laid on the malt, and so taken off. It is  asserted, that by this simple contrivance not one weevil will remain in  the heap. Malt intended for brewing should be always screened before  grinding; and for this purpose it is a good contrivance to screen it by  means of the horse mill, as it runs from the hopper to the rollers or  stones to be ground, the expense of which apparatus is comparatively  nothing when compared to the advantages arising from it.          [2] By some this construction of a steep may be thought too dear;        in that case, a rough wooden one may be substituted, which,        instead of placing outside the house, I would place on the upper        floor of the malt house, so as to afford the opportunity of        getting down its contents to the lower floor by means of a plug        hole, which will save the labour of shovelling; but in summer,        when this steep is not employed, it should be filled with lime        water to prevent leaking, and to keep it sweet.          _Wooden Kilns, how constructed._      The best form for these kilns is the circular. I will suppose the  diameter sixteen feet; you construct your fire-place suitably to the  burning of wood at about ten feet outside your kiln house, sufficiently  elevated on iron bars to secure the draft of the fire place, from which  runs a proportionate sized flue into the kiln, communicating with a  circular flue which is close covered at top, and rounds the kiln on the  inside at the distance of two feet from the wall; on both sides of this  circular flue holes are left, at the distance of twelve or sixteen  inches apart, on both sides, to let out the smoke and heat; the  platform or floor of this kiln is raised about four or five feet above  the top of the flue, and is made of three quarter inch boards, tongued  and grooved, supported by joists two inches broad, and nine inches  deep, placed at proportioned distances, to give solidity to the floor.  The floor or platform of this kiln should be carefully laid, and well  nailed; in this floor should be placed a wooden chimney, nine inches  square, on the most convenient part of the inside next the wall, with a  wooden register at a convenient distance: this chimney is intended to  let off the great smoke that arises in the kiln at first lighting fire,  particularly if the wood be moist or green. When this has gone off, and  the fire burns clear, the register may be shut within a few inches, in  order to keep up a small draft. It would have been proper to state that  joists, intended to support the floor of this kiln, should be levelled  off to one inch, top and bottom, so as give the fire a better chance to  act upon the malt; these joists should be further paid as soon as, or  before, laying down, with a strong solution of alum water; as also the  bottom face of the boards laid on them, which should be first planed;  the inside of the chimney and register should be also paid with the  alum solution. On the top of the kiln should be placed a ventilator to  draw off the steam of the malt, this may be done by means of a loover  or cow; the latter turns with the wind, the former is stationary.    There should be skirting boards, nine inches deep, to lie close to the  floor and walls of the kiln, plastered with hair mortar on the top.  This construction of kiln has been introduced by the Dutch, and will be  found the most economical of any, joined to the peculiar advantage of  being capable of drying malt with any kind of fuel, without danger of  communicating any sort of bad flavour to the grain, while the heat can  be securely raised to 120 degrees without any danger of ignition or  burning; a higher heat is not wanted to dry pale malt. Of this,  however, I have some doubts, as wood is a non-conductor of heat, and  possibly is not susceptible of transmitting such a heat to the malt  without danger of ignition. I should think that thin metal plates, one  foot square, cast so as to lap on each other, or tiles, of the same  make or form, would be a better covering; they certainly would convey  the heat more rapidly and securely to the malt or grain intended to be  dried on it, never requiring less fuel than the wooden covering, and  precluding all danger of fire.    [Illustration:    A A A A A ground section of the vats.  B the section of elevation.]          _A new and economical construction of Vats for keeping Beer, which,  in this way, may be rendered fire proof, whilst, at the same time, it  secures a temperature for the liquor equal, it is expected to the best  vaults: it further affords the convenience of having them above  ground._      These vats may be constructed in different forms, either square, oval,  or round; the latter I should prefer, as stronger, and less liable to  leak. These circular vats, to save expense, may be bound with wood  hoops instead of iron ones the splay to be given them as little as  possible barely sufficient to have the hoops tight, and the vessel  staunch. The bottoms of these vats should be elevated at least three  and a half, or four feet from the ground, and solidly bedded in clay,  earth, or sand; the clay, if convenient, to be preferred. As the earth  rises, at every five or six inches, around these vats, it should be  firmly pounded down and compressed, as in the case of tanners' vats;  and this mode of surrounding the vats with dry earth well pounded and  rammed is continued to the top; a stout, close, well-fitted cover of  two inch plank is then placed on each vat, with a hole sixteen inches  square, to let a man down occasionally; this hole should have a short  trunk of an inch and a half plank firmly nailed to its sides, and about  fourteen inches high; then a covering of earth, twelve inches deep,  should be placed all over the tops of these vats, and this earth well  rammed and compacted together; and when levelled off, covered with  composition or a floor of tiles. Each of the trap doors should have a  well-fitted, wooden cover on the top, with a ring of iron in the  centre; this cover should be made fire proof on the outside. The brick  wall in front of these vats need not, I apprehend, exceed fourteen  inches thick, if of brick, just sufficient to resist the force of  pressure from ramming the clay; vats thus placed, with their contents,  may be considered fire proof, and possessing as cool a temperature as  if placed fifteen feet under ground; joined to this, they will last six  times as long as those in cellars or vaults, although bound in iron, at  a considerable higher expense. Two ranges of these vats may be placed  in one house, leaving a sufficient space for a passage in the centre,  with a window at each end to light it. I have never before either heard  or read of this construction; but I have little hesitation in saying it  will in many cases be found preferable to the present mode of placing  vats--it being more convenient, cleanly, economical, and secure, and,  to all intents and purposes, as effectual in point of temperature as  those expensively placed deep under ground. Under the inside of the  head of these vats, and across the joints, should run a piece of  scantling six inches wide, and four inches deep, with an upright of the  same dimensions in the centre, in order to support the covering on the  head, and to prevent sinking, or swagging, from the weight of the  covering that will be necessarily placed over them, which will be from  six to ten inches thick.          _Grinding, how substituted for._      Malt, for brewing, may be prepared in three different ways, by  grinding, bruising, or pounding; modern practice, however, almost  universally gives the preference to bruising between metal rollers.  This preference, where malt is of the very first quality, may be  justified; but where it is of an inferior quality, which is but"]]]
