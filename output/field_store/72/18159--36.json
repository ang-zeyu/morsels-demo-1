The marriage took place in  the July of 1554, and the chair used by Queen Mary is now standing in  Bishop Langton's chapel.    [Illustration: OLD VIEW OF THE CATHEDRAL (LOOKING SOUTHWARDS).]    Some stormy years at the end of Gardiner's interrupted episcopacy and  during the rule of his immediate successors did not much affect  Winchester externally; but under Robert Horne the whole diocese suffered  terribly through the \"Puritanical\" views of its bishop. The Norman  chapter-house was pulled down, part of the lead on the cathedral roof  was stripped off, and stained glass, architectural decorations, etc.,  throughout the neighbourhood were ruthlessly destroyed. However, after a  short period of comparative peace, far worse had yet to come. Under  James I. and during the early part of the reign of Charles I., little  happened to the building beyond the institution of Curle's passage  through the buttress at the southern end of the cathedral, with its  quaint inscription on the western wall. The Great Rebellion, as was only  to be expected, brought Winchester into the utmost peril. The important  situation of the town in the south of England caused it to become the  centre of much hard fighting. Sir William Waller, whom Winchester has no  cause to remember with affection, came very near to destroying the  interior of the cathedral entirely. His troops marched right up the nave  in full war equipment, some even being mounted. Tombs were defaced,  relics scattered, statues mutilated, stained glass smashed, and the more  portable objects carried out into the streets. It is difficult to  estimate with any exactitude what was the whole extent of the damage  done; but we have sufficient testimony in the broken figures, empty  niches, etc., to see that it was great. One highly creditable incident  in the midst of the general disgrace has been recorded--namely, the  preservation from insult of Wykeham's chantry. This was the work of a  Colonel Fiennes, who had been educated at Wykeham's College at  Winchester. The protests of the inhabitants seem to have finally induced  Waller to call off his fanatical troops from their work of destruction  and violation. What might have happened to the cathedral, had this not  been done, it is quite impossible to imagine. \"Of the brass torn from  the violated monuments\" in 1644 \"might have been built a house as strong  as the brazen towers of old romances\" (Ryves's \"_Mercurius Rusticus_\"  quoted by Milner).    Here the architectural history of Winchester Cathedral practically ends.  We find tombs and memorial brasses of all dates, but until the modern  restorations nothing of importance affected the actual appearance of the  church. Among the few examples of Jacobean work to be seen within, the  nave pulpit can hardly be classed, since it was brought from New College  Chapel at Oxford as late as 1884. The two statues of James I. and  Charles I. by the west door are the work of Hubert le Sueur, who came to  England in 1628. The urns which were supposed in the last century to  decorate the reredos have long ago been removed, as has also the gilt  Jacobean canopy which formerly disfigured the centre of this screen; but  Benjamin West's \"Raising of Lazarus\" still remains above the altar.    This century's work in the cathedral is not very formidable in its  extent. All of it is mentioned elsewhere in this book, and it is  sufficient here to say that the erection of Sir G. Scott's choir-screen  and the restoration of the reredos are the most noticeable \"modern\"  features, though the latter was carried out on the old lines as nearly  as was thought advisable. Sir G. Scott's additions to Winchester have by  no means given universal satisfaction, severe language having been  applied to them by more than one expert. The most recent alterations  have consisted chiefly of a very necessary, though costly, strengthening  of the nave roof. This work is, of course, invisible from the ground  level, but can be reached from the stair in the south transept. A repair  of the organ has also been provided for, and new glass has been inserted  in the large south window of the Lady Chapel, in memory of Bishop  Thorold.    [Illustration: MONUMENT TO BISHOP ETHELMAR.  (From Carter's \"Ancient Architecture of England.\")]          CHAPTER II    THE CATHEDRAL BUILDING AND CLOSE      Before any detailed consideration of the architecture of the cathedral,  it is well to be clear as to the various dates of the chief parts. But  it must here be remembered that practically in every instance the now  existing portions replaced still earlier structures on the same site.  Mention has been made already of the changes from the original building  to the one commenced in the eleventh century. In 1079 Bishop Walkelin  laid the foundations of a great Norman church, of which the transepts,  the outer face of the south nave wall, the core of the nave itself, the  crypts, and a portion of the base of the west front are still existing.  Walkelin's work was completed in fourteen years, just before the end of  1093. The tower fell in 1107, but was rebuilt soon afterwards in the  form which we now see it. Bishop de Lucy's work, which came next in date  (1189-1204), includes the Chapel of the Guardian Angels, flanking the  Lady Chapel, at the north-east end of the cathedral, and the  corresponding chapel on the south-east, which afterwards became the  chantry of Bishop Langton. The piers of the presbytery probably date  from about 1320. The west front was rebuilt in Edingdon's time  (1345-1366), and a small part of the reconstruction of the nave, the  first two bays of the north aisle, and a bay of the south are generally  attributed to him. The great re-modelling of the nave, the outer walls  of the presbytery, and the continuation of the Lady Chapel range in date  of completion from the end of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century.  So much, however, of each period has been altered, and often modified  almost beyond recognition by later additions, that it is impossible to  make more than a rough guess at the age of the various portions. The  work of Wykeham and his successors is so important that it must be left  until we reach it in its proper place.    The ground covered by the actual building is one and a half acres in  extent. The close is fine and extensive, and is surrounded by a high and  stout wall which marks the limits of the old Benedictine monastery. The  houses within the close are of widely different dates, from the Early  English period to recent years. They comprise the official residences of  the dean and the canons, together with some private houses. The changes  made from time to time in the distribution of the ground have involved  the disappearance of the old priory buildings, and it is not possible to  trace with certainty their original form. The laying out of the close  has concealed the ground plan of the cloisters which once adjoined the  cathedral. What is now called by the name is the passage between the  south transept and the former chapter-house, which was pulled down in  1570 by the destructive Bishop Horne, in order, it is said, that the  lead in the roof might be sold. Five extremely fine Early Norman arches  which were once part of the chapter-house still remain, and may be seen  in a line with the end of the slype, beyond the south transept. Some  traces of small arches on what is now the extreme outer wall of the  transept mark where arcading once ran along the inner wall of the  chapter-house. No vestige of the roof remains. The \"slype\" is a passage  which was cut through the southern buttress by Bishop Curle, to put a  stop to the constant use of the nave and south aisle as a thoroughfare  by the townspeople. The anagrams on the walls commemorate the purpose of  the passage; the first, on the western arch, reading:--    ILL\\               PREC\\      \\                   \\       >AC                 >ATOR      /                   /    H/       AMBULA    VI/    and that over the eastern arch:--       /ACR\\        S\\        ILL\\       CH\\    /     \\         \\           \\         \\  S<       >A        >IT         >A        >ORO[1]    \\     /         /           /         /     \\ERV/        S/        IST/        F/    In the angle of an old extension of the chapter-house south wall are  traces of the dormitory and infirmary which formerly stood there. The  Early English doorway with Purbeck marble shafts seems to have led to  this dormitory. To the south of this is the deanery or prior's hall, the  acute external arches, which date from the reign of Henry III., forming  a vestibule with a southern aspect, while above are some narrow  lancet-windows. Although the original portion of this hall dates from  the fifteenth century, it was considerably altered in the seventeenth,  during the second Charles's reign. This king himself sometimes stayed at  the deanery, where Philip of Spain lodged for one night before his  marriage. Over a wooden building, which now serves as the dean's  stables, is an ornamental timber roof of late thirteenth-century work,  which was once part of the old pilgrims' or strangers' hall originally  standing in this part of the close for the benefit of pilgrims to the  shrine of S. Swithun.       [1] _Illac precator, hac viator ambula_ (That way thou that         prayest, this way thou that passest by, walk); _Sacra sit illa         choro, serva sit ista foro_ (That way is sacred to the Choir,         that for use to the market-place).    In the south wall of the cathedral, close to the west front, there is a  doorway which is reported to have led to the chapel and charnel-house  mentioned by Leland. \"S. Swithin, now called Trinity,\" he says, \"stands  on the south side of the town, and there is a chapelle with a carnarie  at the west "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#4)"],[1," when the company of moving picture actors and actresses arrived, to be  greeted by Sandy Apgar and his father and his mother.    \"Well, I _am_ glad to see you all again!\" cried Sandy, shaking hands  with Mr. DeVere, the girls and the others. \"It seems like old times!\"    \"We're glad dot you are glad!\" declaimed Mr. Switzer. \"Haf you any more  barns vot need burning down?\"    \"Not this time,\" laughed Sandy. \"One barn-burning is enough for me.\" A  barn, an old one, had been destroyed on the occasion of the previous  visit of the moving picture company--a burning barn being called for in  one of the scenes.    Oak Farm was a big place, and, in anticipation of the war plays to be  enacted there, several buildings had been built to accommodate the extra  actors and actresses, where they could sleep and eat. The DeVere girls  and the other members of the regular company would board at the  farmhouse as they had done before.    Hard work began early the next day. There was much to do in the way of  preliminary preparation, and Pop Snooks, the property man, with a corps  of assistants, was in his element. While Ruth, Alice and the others were  going through a rehearsal of their parts without, of course, the proper  scenic background, the property man was setting up the different \"sets\"  needed in the various scenes.    While they were working on one piece, Sandy Apgar came along on his way  to look after some of the farming operations.    \"Hello!\" he cried. \"Say! you fellows did that mighty quick.\"    \"Did what?\" asked Alice, who stood near, not being engaged for the time  being.    \"Why, dug that well. I didn't know you could strike water so soon,\" and  he pointed to an old-fashioned well with a sweep, which stood not far  from the house. \"What'd you use--a post-hole digger?\" he asked. \"What  sort of water did you strike?\"    Before any one could answer him he strode over to the well, and, as he  looked down into it, a puzzled look came over his face.    \"Well, I'll be jiggered!\" he cried. \"'Tain't a well at all! Only an  imitation!\"    And that was what it was. Some canvas had been stretched in a circle  about a framework, and painted to represent stones. The well itself  stood on top of the ground, not being dug out at all. It made a  perfectly good water-scene, with a sweep, a chain, a bucket and all.    \"I'm supposed to stand there and draw water for the thirsty soldiers,\"  explained Ruth, coming up at this point.    \"Huh! How are you goin' to git water out of there?\" demanded Sandy.  \"It's as dry as a bone. Why, I've got a good well over there,\" and he  pointed to a real one, under an apple tree.    \"That's in the shade--couldn't get any pictures there,\" explained Russ.  \"The well has to be out in the open.\"    \"But what about water?\" asked Sandy. \"Hang me if I ever heard of a well  without water!\"    \"We'll run a hose up to this one,\" explained Pop Snooks. \"A man will lie  down behind the well-curb, where he won't show in the camera. As fast as  Ruth lowers her bucket into the well the man'll fill the pail with water  for the soldiers to drink. It'll be quicker than a real well, and if we  find we don't like it in one place we can move it to another. This is a  movable well.\"    \"Well, I'll be----\" began Sandy, but words failed him. \"This is sure a  queer business,\" he murmured as he strode off.    The hard work of preparation continued. All about the farm queer parts  of buildings were being erected, extra barns, out-houses, bits of fence,  and the like.    In what are called close-up scenes only a small part of an object shows  in the camera, and often when a magnificent entrance to a marble house  is shown, it is only a plaster-of-Paris imitation of a door with a  little frame around it.    What is outside of that would not photograph; so what is the use of  building it? Of course in many scenes real buildings figure, but they  are not built for the purpose.    In one of the war plays a small barn was to be shown, and a soldier was  supposed to jump through the window of this to escape pursuit. As none  of the regular buildings at Oak Farm was in the proper location, Pop  Snooks had been ordered to build a barn.    He did. That is, he built one side of it, propping it up with braces  from behind, where they would not show. The window was there, and some  boards; so that, seen through the camera, it looked like a small part of  a big out-building.    Some hay was piled on the ground to one side, away from the camera, and  it was on this hay that the escaping soldier would land. Then Ruth was  to come to him, and go through some scenes. But these would be interior  views, which would be taken in the improvised studio erected on the farm  for this purpose.    Mr. Switzer was to be the soldier, and would plunge through the barn  window head first. He was called on to rehearse the scenes a few days  after the semblance of a barn had been put in position and the hay laid  out to make his landing safe.    \"Are you ready?\" asked Mr. Pertell, who was directing the scene. \"All  ready, there, Switzer?\"    \"Sure, as ready as I ever shall be.\"    \"All right, then. Now, you understand, you come running out of those  bushes over there, and when you get out you stop for a minute and  register caution. Look on all sides of you. Then you see the barn and  the open window. Register surprise and hope. You say, 'Ah, I shall be  safe in there!'    \"Then you run, look back once or twice to see if you are pursued, and  make a dive, head first, through the open window on to the hay. All  ready now?\"    \"Sure, I'm ready!\"    \"How about you, Russ?\"    \"Let her go.\"    \"All ready, then! Camera!\"    Russ began to grind away at the film. Mr. Switzer had taken his place in  the clump of bushes, his ragged Union garments flapping in the wind. He  came out, looked furtively around, and then, giving the proper  \"registration,\" he advanced cautiously toward the barn.    \"Go on now--run!\" cried Mr. Pertell through his megaphone.    The German actor ran. He made a beautiful leap through the window, and  the next moment there came from him howls of dismay.    \"Donner vetter! Ach Himmel! Ach! My face! My hands! Hey, somebody! bring  a pail of water! Quick!\"          CHAPTER IV    A REHEARSAL      Mingled in German and English came the shouts of dismay from Herr  Switzer inside the dummy shed, through the window of which he had leaped  on to the hay.    \"Oh, what is it?\" cried Ruth, clasping her hands and registering  \"dismay\" unconsciously.    \"He must have fallen and hurt himself,\" ejaculated Alice. \"Do, Paul, go  and see what it is.\"    \"Stop the camera!\" yelled Mr. Pertell through his megaphone. \"Don't  spoil the film, Russ. You got a good scene there. He went through the  window all right, and his yells won't register. Stop the camera!\"    \"Stopped she is,\" reported Russ.    Then those of the players who had been looking on and wondering at Mr.  Switzer's cries could hurry to his rescue.    For it is a crime out of the ordinary in the annals of moving pictures  for any one not in the scene to get within range of the camera when an  act is being filmed. It means not only the spoiling of the reel,  perhaps, but a retaking of that particular action. When Russ ceased to  grind at the camera crank, however, it was the same as when the shutter  of an ordinary camera is closed. No more views can be taken. It was safe  for others to cross the field of vision.    \"What's the matter?\" cried Paul, who, with Ruth and Alice and some of  the others trailing after him, was hurrying toward the false front of  boards that represented a shed.    \"Did a cow critter or a sheep step on you?\" Russ questioned.    \"Ach! My face! My clothes! Ruined!\" came in accents of deep disgust from  the actor. \"Never again will I leap through a window without knowing  into what I am going to land. Ach!\"    \"What happened?\" asked Paul, trying to keep from laughing, for the  player's voice was so funnily tragic.    \"What happened? Come and see!\" cried Mr. Switzer. \"I have into a  chicken's home invaded myself already!\"    \"Invaded himself into a chicken's home!\" exclaimed Mr. Pertell. \"What in  the world does he mean?\"    \"I guess he means he sat down in a hen's nest!\" chuckled Paul, and this  proved to be the case.    Going around to the other side of the erected boards, the players and  others saw a curious sight.    Seated on the hay, his face, his hair, his hands, and his clothing a  mass of the whites and yellows of eggs, was Carl Switzer. He held up his  fingers, dripping with the ingredients of half a dozen omelets.    \"The chicken's home was right here, in the hay--where I jumped. I landed  right in among the eggs--head first. Get me some water--quick!\" implored  the player.    \"Didn't you see the eggs before you jumped among 'em?\" asked Mr.  Pertell.    \"See them? I should say not! Think you I would have precipitated myself  into their midst had I done so?\" indignantly demanded Mr. Switzer,  relapsing into his formally-learned English. \"I have no desire to be a  part of a scrambled egg,\" he went on. \"Some water--quick!\"    While one of the extra players was bringing the water, Sandy Apgar  strolled past. He was told what had happened.    \"Plumped himself down in a hen's nest, did he?\" exclaimed the young  proprietor of Oak Farm. \"Wa'al, now, if you folks go to upsettin' the  domestic arrangements of my fowls that way I'll have t' be charging you  higher prices,\" and he laughed good-naturedly.    \"Ach! Dat is better,\" said Mr. Switzer, when he had cleansed himself.  \"How came it, do you think, Mr. Apgar, that the hen laid her eggs right  where I was to make my landing when escaping from the Confederates?\"    \"Huh! More than one hen laid her eggs there, I reckon,\" the farmer said.  \"There must have been half a dozen of 'em who had rooms in that  apartment. You see, it's this way. Hens love to steal away and lay their  eggs in secret places. After you folks built this"]]]
