He therefore resolved to treat them with  lenity; and though they were not comprehended in the act, they enjoyed  the benefit of the toleration.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          VIOLENT DISPUTES ABOUT THE BILL FOR A COMPREHENSION.    We have observed that, in consequence of the motion made by the bishops  when they withdrew from parliament, a bill was brought into the house  of lords for uniting their majesties' protestant subjects. This was  extremely agreeable to the king, who had the scheme of comprehension  very much at heart. In the progress of the bill a warm debate arose  about the posture of kneeling at the sacrament, which was given up  in favour of the dissenters. Another no less violent ensued upon the  subsequent question, \"Whether there should be an addition of laity in  the commission to be given by the king to the bishops and others of the  clergy, for preparing such a reformation of ecclesiastical affairs as  might be the means of healing divisions, and correcting whatever might  be erroneous or defective in the constitution.\" A great number of  the temporal lords insisted warmly on this addition, and when it was  rejected four peers entered a formal protest. Bishop Burnet was a  warm stickler for the exclusion of the laity; and, in all probability,  manifested this warmth in hopes of ingratiating himself with his  brethren, among whom his character was very far from being popular. But  the merit of this sacrifice was destroyed by the arguments he had used  for dispensing with the posture of kneeling at the sacrament; and by his  proposing in another proviso of the bill, that the subscribers, instead  of expressing assent or consent, should only submit with a promise of  conformity.          THE COMMONS ADDRESS THE KING TO SUMMON A CONVOCATION.    The bill was with difficulty passed in the house of lords, but the  commons treated it with neglect. By this time a great number of  malcontent members, who had retired from parliament, were returned with  a view to thwart the administration, though they could not prevent  the settlement. Instead of proceeding with the bill they presented  an address to the king, thanking him for his gracious declaration and  repeated assurances that he would maintain the church of England as by  law established; a church whose doctrine and practice had evinced its  loyalty beyond all contradiction. They likewise humbly besought his  majesty to issue writs for calling a convocation of the clergy, to be  consulted in ecclesiastical matters according to the ancient usage  of parliaments; and they declared they would forthwith take into  consideration proper methods for giving ease to protestant dissenters.  Though the king was displeased at this address, in which the lords also  had concurred, he returned a civil answer by the mouth of the earl  of Nottingham, professing his regard for the church of England, which  should always be his peculiar care, recommending the dissenters to their  protection, and promising to summon a convocation as soon as such a  measure should be convenient. This message produced no effect in favour  of the bill which lay neglected on the table. Those who moved for it  had no other view than that of displaying their moderation: and now they  excited their friends to oppose it with all their interest. Others were  afraid of espousing it lost they should be stigmatized as enemies to the  church; and a great number of the most eminent presbyterians wore  averse to a scheme of comprehension, which diminished their strength and  weakened the importance of the party. Being therefore violently opposed  on one hand, and but faintly supported on the other, no wonder it  miscarried. The king however was so bent upon the execution of his  design, that it was next session revived in another form though with no  better success.          SETTLEMENT OF THE REVENUE.    The next object that engrossed the attention of the parliament was the  settlement of a revenue for the support of the government. Hitherto  there had been no distinction of what was allotted for the king's  use, and what was assigned for the service of the public; so that the  sovereign was entirely master of the whole supply. As the revenue in the  late reigns had been often embezzled and misapplied, it was now resolved  that a certain sum should be set apart for the maintenance of the king's  household and the support of his dignity; and that the rest of the  public money should be employed under the inspection of parliament.  Accordingly, since this period, the commons have appropriated the  yearly supplies to certain specified services; and an account of the  application has been constantly submitted to both houses at the next  session. At this juncture the prevailing party, or the whigs, determined  that the revenue should be granted from year to year, or at least for a  small term of years; that the king might find himself dependent upon  the parliament, and merit the renewal of the grant by a just and popular  administration. In pursuance of this maxim, when the revenue fell under  consideration, they, under pretence of charges and anticipations which  they had not time to examine, granted it by a provisional act for one  year only. The civil list was settled at six hundred thousand pounds,  chargeable with the appointments of the queen dowager, the prince and  princess of Denmark, the judges, and mareschal Schomberg, to whom  the parliament had already granted one hundred thousand pounds, in  consideration of his important services to the nation. The commons also  voted that a constant revenue of twelve hundred thousand pounds should  be established for the support of the crown in time of peace.          THE KING TAKES UMBRAGE AT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE WHIG PARTY.    The king took umbrage at these restraints laid upon the application of  the public money, which were the most salutary fruits of the revolution.  He considered them as marks of diffidence by which he was distinguished  from his predecessors; and thought them an ungrateful return for the  services he had done the nation. The tories perceived his disgust, and  did not fail to foment his jealousy against their adversaries, which  was confirmed by a fresh effort of the whigs in relation to a militia.  A bill was brought into the house for regulating it in such a manner as  would have rendered it in a great measure independent both of the king  and the lords-lieutenants of counties. These being generally peers,  the bill was suffered to lie neglected on the table, but the attempt  confirmed the suspicion of the king, who began to think himself in  danger of being enslaved by a republican party. The tories had, by the  channel of Nottingham, made proffers of service to his majesty; but  complained at the same time that as they were in danger of being  prosecuted for their lives and fortunes, they could not, without an act  of indemnity, exert themselves in favour of the crown, lest they should  incur a persecution from their implacable enemies.          HEATS AND ANIMOSITIES ABOUT THE BILL OF INDEMNITY.    These remonstrances made such an impression on the king, that he sent a  message to the house by Mr. Hambden, recommending a bill of indemnity  as the most effectual means for putting an end to all controversies,  distinctions, and occasions of discord. He desired it might be prepared  with all convenient expedition, and with such exceptions only as should  seem necessary for the vindication of public justice, the safety of  him and his consort, and the settlement and welfare of the nation. An  address of thanks to his majesty was unanimously voted. Nevertheless,  his design was frustrated by the backwardness of the whigs, who  proceeded so slowly on the bill that it could not be brought to maturity  before the end of the session. They wanted to keep the scourge over the  heads of their enemies until they should find a proper opportunity for  revenge; and, in the meantime, restrain them from opposition by the  terror of impending vengeance. They affected to insinuate that the  king's design was to raise the prerogative as high as it had been in  the preceding reigns; and that he for this purpose pressed an act of  indemnity, by virtue of which he might legally use the instruments of  the late tyranny. The earls of Monmouth and Warrington industrously  infused these jealousies into the minds of their party: on the other  hand, the earl of Nottingham inflamed William's distrust of his old  friends: both sides succeeded in kindling an animosity, which had like  to have produced confusion, notwithstanding the endeavours used by the  earls of Shrewsbury and Devonshire, to allay those heats and remove the  suspicions that mutually prevailed.          BIRTH OF THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER.    It was now judged expedient to pass an act for settling the succession  of the crown according to the former resolution of the convention. A  bill for this purpose was brought into the lower house, with a clause  disabling papists from succeeding to the throne: to this the lords  added, \"Or such as should marry papists,\" absolving the subject in that  case from allegiance, The bishop of Salisbury, by the king's direction,  proposed that the princess Sophia, duchess of Hanover, and her  posterity, should be nominated in the act of succession as the next  protestant heirs, failing issue of the king and Anne princess of  Denmark. These amendments gave rise to warm debates in the lower house,  where they were vigorously opposed, not only by those who wished well in  secret to the late king and the lineal succession, but likewise by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19218"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.III. (#4)"],[1,"e, and the privy  seal was given to the Duke of Bedford. The resignation of Mr. Pitt, with  his honours and rewards, were published in the Gazette on the following  day, and in the same paper a letter was published from the English  ambassador at Madrid, which was replete with assurances of the pacific  intentions of Spain. On this circumstance, combined with the resignation  of Mr. Pitt, Burke remarks:--\"It must be owned that this manouvre was  very skilfully executed: for it at once gave the people to understand  the true motive to the resignation, the insufficiency of that motive,  and the gracious-ness of the king, notwithstanding the abrupt departure  of his minister. If after this the late minister should choose to  enter into opposition, he must go into it loaded and oppressed with the  imputation of the blackest ingratitude; if, on the other hand, he should  retire from business, or should concur in support of that administration  which he had left, because he disapproved its measures, his acquiescence  would be attributed by the multitude to a bargain for his forsaking  the public, and that the title and his pension were the considerations.  These were the barriers that opposed against that torrent of popular  rage which it was apprehended would proceed from this resignation. And  the truth is, they answered their end perfectly.\"    This reasoning of Mr. Burke was strictly correct. The friends and  partisans of Mr. Pitt raised violent clamours against Bute, for  displacing a man who had raised the nation from its once abject state to  the pinnacle of glory; and addresses, resolutions, and condolences  were set on foot in London and the greater corporations, with a view  of exciting the smaller cities and boroughs in England to follow the  example. The press, also, was active in vilifying Bute for the part  he had taken in this affair. But Bute had his friends as well as his  enemies, and Pitt had his enemies as well as his friends. The press  worked on both sides of the question; while it vilified Bute, it  animadverted on Pitt's pensions and honours. At the same time the people  were only partially in the favour of the ex-minister. The progress  of addresses, resolutions, and condolences was languid, and in some  instances the people were disposed to cast odium _upon_, and to blacken  the character _of_, the retired secretary. The popularity of Pitt was,  in truth, obscured with mists and clouds for a time, and it was not  till after he had raised a few thunder-storms of opposition, that his  political atmosphere once again became radiant with the sunshine of  prosperity. For the mind of Pitt was not to be long borne down by its  heavy weight of gratitude to royalty, or by public accusations: he soon  shook off the one, and resolutely braved the other.          THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING.    On the 8th of July the young king having called an extraordinary  council, made the following declaration to its members:--\"Having nothing  so much at heart as to procure the welfare and happiness of my people,  and to render the same stable and permanent to posterity, I have, ever  since my accession to the throne, turned my thoughts towards the choice  of a princess for my consort; and I now with great satisfaction acquaint  you, that after the fullest information, and mature deliberation, I am  come to a resolution to demand in marriage the Princess Charlotte of  Mecklenberg Strelitz; a princess distinguished by every eminent virtue  and amiable endowment; whose illustrious line has constantly shown the  firmest zeal for the Protestant religion, and a particular attachment  to my family. I have judged it proper to communicate to you these my  intentions, in order that you may be fully apprised of a matter so  highly important to me and to my kingdoms, and which I persuade myself  will be most acceptable to my loving subjects.\"    The preliminary negociations concerning this union had been conducted  with great secresy, whence this announcement occasioned some surprise to  most of the members of the extraordinary council. It met, however, with  the warmest approbation of them all, and the treaty was concluded on the  15th of August. The Earl of Harcourt, with the Duchesses of Ancaster and  Hamilton, were selected to escort the young bride to England, and Lord  Anson was the commander of the fleet destined to convoy the royal yacht.  Princess Charlotte arrived in England on the 7th of September, and on  the following day she was escorted to St. James's, where she was met by  his majesty.    Before the arrival of the future Queen of England, in a letter to one  of his correspondents, Lord Harcourt had given this description of  her:--\"Our queen, that is to be, has seen very little of the world;  but her very good sense, vivacity, and cheerfulness, I dare say will  recommend her to the king, and make her the darling of the British  nation. She is no regular beauty; but she is of a pretty size, has a  charming complexion, with very pretty eyes, and is finely made.\" Lord  Harcourt was right in his conjectures concerning the views which the  king would take of his young bride. It is said, that in the first  interview, although he saluted her tenderly, the king was disappointed  in not finding in the princess those personal charms which he had  expected. But this was only a momentary feeling. The king soon  became interested in her artlessness, cheerful manners, and obliging  disposition, while the whole court was loud in their praises of her  affability, and even of her beauty. \"In half an hour,\" says Horace  Walpole, \"one heard of nothing but proclamations of her beauty:  everybody was content; everybody was pleased.\" So the marriage  took place in the midst of good-humour and rejoicings: the nuptial  benediction was given by Dr. Seeker, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the  Duke of Cumberland gave away the bride.          CORONATION OF THEIR MAJESTIES.    Extraordinary preparations were made for the coronation of their  majesties. It took place on the 22nd of September, and though described  as solemn and magnificent, it did not materially differ from preceding  coronations. The crown was placed on the head of the monarch by  Archbishop Seeker, and before his majesty partook of the holy sacrament,  he exhibited a very pleasing instance of piety before the assembled  court. As he approached the altar, he asked if he might lay aside his  crown; and when the archbishop, after consulting with Bishop Pearce,  replied, that no order existed on the subject in the service, he  rejoined, \"Then it ought to be done;\" at the same time taking the diadem  from his head, he placed it, reverentially, on the altar. His majesty  wished the queen to manifest the same reverence to the Almighty, but  being informed that her crown was fastened to her hair, he did not press  the subject. On the return of the procession, an incident occurred,  which, had it happened among the nations of antiquity, would have been  considered an omen of evil portent, which could only have been averted  by a whole hecatomb of sacrifices. The most valuable diamond in his  majesty's diadem fell from it, and was for some time lost, but it was  afterwards found, and restored to his crown. The coronation of George  III. could boast of one very extraordinary spectator among the many  thousands present. This was Charles Edward Stuart, the young Pretender,  who had come over in disguise, and who obtained admission into the  abbey, and witnessed all the ceremonies consecrating a king on that  throne which he considered legitimately belonged to his father or  himself! It is said that George knew that he was in London, and that  he would not allow him to be molested; feeling, no doubt, secure in the  affections of a loyal people. And that he was secure, the eclat with  which the great festival of his coronation passed off, fully manifested.  All combined to testify that their majesties were very popular, and that  they had good reasons for anticipating a happy and prosperous reign.          MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.    The new parliament met on the 3rd of November, when Sir John Cust was  elected speaker of the commons. He was presented to his majesty on the  6th, on which day the king, having first approved of the choice, thus  addressed both houses:--\"At the opening of the first parliament summoned  and elected under my authority, I with pleasure notice an event which  has made me completely happy, and given universal joy to my loving  subjects. My marriage with a princess, eminently distinguished by every  virtue and amiable endowment, while it affords me all possible domestic  comfort, cannot but highly contribute to the happiness of my kingdoms,  which has been, and always shall be, the first object in every action of  my life.    \"It has been my earnest wish that this first period of my reign might be  marked with another felicity; the restoring of the blessings of peace to  my people, and putting an end to the calamities of war, under which so  great a part of Europe suffers: but though overtures were made to  me, and my good brother and ally, the King of Prussia, by the several  belligerent powers, in order to a general pacification, for which  purpose a congress was appointed, and propositions were made to me by  France for a particular peace with that crown, which were followed by an  actual negociation; yet that congress has not hitherto taken place, and  the negociation with France is entirely broken off.    \"The sincerity of my disposition to effectuate this good work has been  manifested in the progress of it: and I have the consolation to reflect,  that the continuance of the war, and the further effusion of Christian  blood, to which it was the desire of my heart to put a stop, cannot,  with justice, be imputed to me.    \"Our military operations have been in no degree suspended or delayed;  and it has pleased God to grant us further important success, by the "]]]
