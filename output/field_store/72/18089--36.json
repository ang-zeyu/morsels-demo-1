Should you be aided to render such a service, rest ye assured that your  heads shall be crowned with the diadem of everlasting sovereignty.\"            CANADA TO FORM SEPARATE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY      In the Dominion of Canada, to whose significance and future the Author of  the Tablets of the Divine Plan has repeatedly referred, and in all the  nine provinces of which, as a direct result of the operation of the first  Seven Year Plan, the Faith has established its spiritual assemblies, the  Canadian believers, as a token of their recognition of the significance of  the forthcoming formation of their first National Spiritual Assembly, must  arise and carry out befittingly the task allotted to them in their  homeland. Irrespective of the smallness of their numbers, notwithstanding  the vastness of the territory for which they have been made responsible,  and as a sign of their appreciation of the great bounty and independent  status soon to be conferred upon them, they must, unitedly, exert a  supreme effort to enlarge the limits, multiply the administrative centers,  consolidate the institutions, and broadcast the truths and essentials of  their beloved Faith throughout the length and breadth of that immense  dominion.    The thirteen Canadian assemblies already formed should be, at all costs,  maintained and fortified. The fifty-six localities where Baha'is reside  should receive immediate attention, and the most promising among them  should be chosen for the establishment of future assemblies, in order to  broaden the basis and reinforce the foundations of the future pillar of  the Universal House of Justice. Particular attention should, moreover, be  paid to the need for the establishment, without delay, of the first  Canadian Baha'i summer school, which, as the scope of the activities of  the Canadian believers extends, will have to be gradually supplemented by  other institutions of a similar character, as has been the case in the  development of summer schools in the United States of America. Preliminary  steps should, likewise, be taken for the incorporation of all firmly  grounded spiritual assemblies, as a prelude to the establishment of local  and national endowments. The institution of the local Fund, in every  center where the administrative structure of the Faith has been erected,  should be assiduously developed. The holding of conferences designed to  foster the unity, the solidarity and harmonious development of the  Canadian Baha'i Community should be steadily encouraged. An organized  attempt should be made to broadcast the Message to the masses and their  leaders through the medium of the press and radio. A deliberate and  sustained endeavor should be exerted to win fresh recruits for the Faith  from the ranks of the considerable French-speaking population of that  dominion. The greatest care should be exercised to attract the attention,  and win the support of other minorities in that land, such as the Indians,  the Eskimos, the Dukhobors and the Negroes, thereby reinforcing the  representative character of a rapidly developing community.    Nor should that community, as its local centers multiply, and the fabric  of its national institutions is erected, and its maturity is demonstrated,  and its independence vindicated, lose sight of, or neglect, the weighty  provisions of those Tablets of the Divine Plan, addressed specifically to  its members by 'Abdu'l-Baha, wherein He confers upon them the mission of  carrying the Message of His Father to territories and islands beyond the  confines of that dominion, to Newfoundland and the Franklin Islands, to  the Yukon, to Mackenzie, Keewatin, Ungava and Greenland. The tentative  steps recently taken by a Danish believer in disseminating Baha'i  literature in the territory of Greenland, in a number of settlements and  outposts beyond the Arctic Circle, and in dispatching Baha'i books to  Godthaab, its capital, and as far north as Upernavik on Baffin Bay,  constitutes a modest yet historic beginning which the Canadian believers,  in the light of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Tablets addressed to them, must follow up  in the years to come.    \"Should the fire of the love of God be kindled in Greenland,\" He  significantly assures them in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, \"all  the ice of that country will be melted, and its cold weather become  temperate--that is, if the hearts be touched with the heat of the love of  God, that territory will become a divine rose garden and a heavenly  paradise, and the souls, even as fruitful trees, will acquire the utmost  freshness and beauty. Effort, the utmost effort, is required.\"    Theirs is the duty, the privilege and honor, once their central  administrative institution is firmly established, its subsidiary agencies  are vigorously operating, and its immediate requirements are met, to take  preliminary measures, on however small a scale, ere the Second Seven Year  Plan is terminated, for the dispatch of a handful of pioneers to some of  these territories, as an evidence of the determination and capacity of a  newly independent national community to assume the functions, and  discharge the responsibilities with which it has been invested in those  immortal Tablets by the pen of the Center of Baha'u'llah's Covenant.    \"There is no difference between countries,\" is 'Abdu'l-Baha's testimony in  one of those Tablets. \"The future of the Dominion of Canada, however, is  very great, and the events connected with it infinitely glorious. It shall  become the object of the glance of Providence, and shall show forth the  bounties of the All-Glorious.\" \"Again I repeat,\" He, in that same Tablet  affirms, \"that the future of Canada is very great, whether from a material  or a spiritual standpoint.... The clouds of the Kingdom will water the  seeds of guidance which have been sown there.\"            TASKS IN LATIN AMERICA      In the far-flung Latin American field, where the first fruits of the  Divine Plan, operating beyond the confines of the North American  continent, have already been garnered in such abundance, the Latin  American Baha'i communities, from the Mexican border to the extremity of  Chile, should bestir themselves for the collective, the historic and  gigantic tasks that await them, and which must culminate, ere the expiry  of the present Plan, in the formation of two national spiritual assemblies  for Central and South America.    The marvelous progress achieved as a result of the operation of the first  Seven Year Plan, as evidenced by the establishment of full-fledged  spiritual assemblies in the virgin territories of no less than fourteen  republics, and the formation of active groups in the remaining republics,  has been enhanced by the even more startling expansion of Baha'i activity  since the termination of the first stage of the Divine Plan. As a result  of this expansion spiritual assemblies have been established in all the  remaining republics, the number of localities where Baha'is reside has  been raised to over a hundred, almost double the number of localities in  which the Faith had been introduced after the completion of the first  Seven Year Plan, the number of spiritual assemblies has swelled to no less  than thirty-seven, three of which have been duly incorporated, a notable  impetus has been given to the activities of the distributing centers of  Baha'i literature in Argentina and Panama, historic conferences have been  held in these two republics, summer schools have been inaugurated in  Argentina and Chile, and a tract of land has been presented as a site for  the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar in Latin America. No community since the  inception of the hundred-year-old Faith of Baha'u'llah, not even the  community of the Most Great Name in the North American continent, can  boast of an evolution as rapid, a consolidation as sound, a multiplication  of centers as swift, as those that have marked the birth and rise of the  community of His followers in Latin America.    The colossal tasks that now summon this Latin American Baha'i community to  a challenge, cannot but dwarf, if faithfully and promptly accomplished,  the magnificent achievements that have immortalized the first decade of  organized activity in Latin American Baha'i history. The seed-sowing stage  associated, in the main, with the labors and travels of that saintly soul,  that star-servant of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, the incomparable Martha  Root, links this decade of organized Baha'i activity in Latin America with  both the closing years of the Heroic Age of our Faith and the first  fifteen years of the initial epoch of the Age we live in.            TWO REGIONAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES A VITAL OBJECTIVE      The emergence of organized local communities in most of the republics of  Latin America will be forever associated with the exploits that have shed  such luster on the first stage of the Divine Plan launched during the  concluding years of that first epoch of the Formative Age of our Faith.  The constitution of two independent duly elected national spiritual  assemblies for the northern and southern zones of Latin America is now to  be regarded as one of the most vital objectives of the Second Seven Year  Plan, whose inauguration synchronizes with the opening years of the second  Baha'i century, and which will be chiefly associated with the first phase  of the second epoch of that Age. The emergence of these two national  assemblies, precursors of the institutions which must participate in the  election, and contribute to the support, of the Universal House of  Justice--the last crowning unit in the erection of the fabric of the  Administrative Order of the Faith of Baha'u'llah--must lead gradually and  uninterruptedly, and in the course of successive epochs of the Formative  Age, to the constitution in each of the republics of Central and South  America, of a properly elected,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#4)"],[1,"conditions  and however great their merits to the properly constituted Assemblies. You  and your co-workers can never over-estimate or over-emphasize this  cardinal principle of Baha'i Administration.\"            32: BIBLE (AUTHENTICITY OF THE)      \"As to the question raised by the Racine Assembly in connection with  Baha'u'llah's statement in the Gleanings concerning the sacrifice of  I_sh_mael; although His statement does not agree with that made in the  Bible, Genesis 12:9, the friends should unhesitatingly, and for reasons  that are only too obvious, give precedence to the sayings of Baha'u'llah  which, it would be pointed out, is fully corroborated by the Qur'an, which  book is more authentic than the Bible, including both the New and Old  Testaments. The Bible is not wholly authentic, and in this respect not to  be compared with the Qur'an, and should be wholly subordinated to the  authentic Sayings of Baha'u'llah.\"            33: CALENDAR (BAHA'I)      \"It is advisable to use both the Baha'i dates, according to the Baha'i  Calendar, and the usual Gregorian dates as well. The friends at present  are free to do as they please.\"            34: CALIPHATE AND IMAMATE      \"Both Caliphate and Imamate mean successorship. Either term could be  used.\"            35: CATASTROPHE (THE APOCALYPTIC UPHEAVAL)      \"We have no indication of exactly what nature the apocalyptic upheaval  will be; it might be another war ... but as students of our Baha'i  Writings, it is clear that the longer the 'Divine Physician' (i.e.  Baha'u'llah) is withheld from healing the ills of the world, the more  severe will be the crisis, and the more terrible the sufferings of the  patient.\"            36: CIVIL COURTS (DISPUTES)      \"The Guardian wishes to emphasize the importance of avoiding (reference to  civil courts) of cases of dispute between believers, even in non-Baha'i  issues. It is the Assembly's function to endeavor to settle amicably such  disputes, both in order to safeguard the fair name and prestige of the  Cause, and to acquire the necessary experience for the extension of its  functions in the future.\"            37: CIVIL ELECTIONS (VOTING IN)      \"...No Baha'i vote for an officer, no Baha'i participation in the affairs  of the Republic, shall involve acceptance of a program or policy that  contravenes any vital principle, spiritual or social, of the Faith.    \"...No vote cast, or office undertaken, by a Baha'i should necessarily  constitute acceptance, by the voter or office holder, of the entire  program of any political party. No Baha'i can be regarded as either a  Republican or Democrat, as such. He is above all else, the supporter of  the principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, with which, I am firmly  convinced, the program of no political party is completely harmonious.\"            38: COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS (ASSEMBLY MEMBERS)      \"Regarding the non-appointment of Assembly members to membership on  National Committees, the Guardian firmly believes that no such principle  should be recognised. Those who are best fitted for the specific work  assigned to the Committees should be elected irrespective of their  membership on either National or local Assemblies. The greater the  pressure on those who shoulder both Committee and Assembly  responsibilities, the greater the reward and the richer the blessings  vouchsafed to those who willingly and gratefully sustain this double  burden.\"            39: COMMITTEES' RESPONSIBILITIES      \"He feels that Committees must assume more responsibility and exercise  freedom of choice and judgment in electing their officers, and function as  a corporate body with a corporate spirit. More especially so as now that  the Cause is growing in numbers, and its responsibilities are being  multiplied, National committees are acquiring added importance and must  seek, ever increasingly, to follow the pattern of Baha'u'llah and assume  responsibility for the election of their officers. These committees must  develop, become mature, and forge ahead courageously relying more on  united effort and less on personal leadership, as is now the case with  Local and National Assemblies.\"            40: CONTRIBUTION      \"As to the idea of 'giving what one can afford', this does by no means put  a limit or even exclude the possibility of self-sacrifice. There can be no  limit to one's contributions to the national fund. The more one can give  the better it is, especially when such offerings necessitate the sacrifice  of other wants and desires on the part of the donor. The harder the  sacrifice the more meritorious will it be of course in the eye of God. For  after all it is not so much the quantity of one's offerings that matters,  but rather the measure of deprivation that such offerings entail.\"            41: CONTRIBUTIONS (LIFTING THE BURDEN OF MISERY FROM MANKIND)      \"...In the first place every believer is free to follow the dictates of  his own conscience as regards the manner in which to spend his own money.  Secondly, we must always bear in mind that there are so few Baha'is in the  world, relative to the world's population, and so many people in need,  that even if all of us gave all we had, it would not alleviate more than  an infinitesimal amount of suffering. This does not mean we must not help  the needy, we should; but our contributions to the Faith are the surest  way of lifting once and for all time the burden of hunger and misery from  mankind, for it is only through the System of Baha'u'llah--Divine in  origin--that the world can be gotten on its feet, and want, fear, hunger,  war, etc., be eliminated. Non-Baha'is cannot contribute to our work or do  it for us; so really our first obligation is to support our own teaching  work, as this will lead to the healing of the nations.\"            42: CONTRIBUTIONS ARE VOLUNTARY      \"In connection with the Institution of the National Fund and the budgetary  system set forth in the minutes of the National Spiritual Assembly, I feel  urged to remind you of the necessity of ever bearing in mind the cardinal  principle that all contributions to the Fund are to be purely and strictly  voluntary in character. It should be made clear and evident to every one  that any form of compulsion, however slight and indirect, strikes at the  very root principle underlying the formation of the Fund ever since its  inception. While appeals of a general character, carefully worded and  moving and dignified in tone are welcome under all circumstances, it  should be left entirely to the discretion of every conscientious believer  to decide upon the nature, the amount, and purpose of his or her  contribution for the propagation of the Cause.\"            43: COVENANT (MEANING OF BAHA'I)      \"As regards the meaning of the Baha'i Covenant: The Guardian considers the  existence of two forms of Covenant both of which are explicitly mentioned  in the literature of the Cause. First is the Covenant that every Prophet  makes with humanity or, more definitely, with His people that they will  accept and follow the coming Manifestation who will be the reappearance of  His reality. The second form of Covenant is such as the one Baha'u'llah  made with His people that they should accept the Master. This is merely to  establish and strengthen the succession of the series of Lights that  appear after every Manifestation. Under the same category falls the  Covenant the Master made with the Baha'is that they should accept His  administration after Him.\"    \"The Most Great Covenant is different from the Everlasting Covenant.\"            44: COVENANT BREAKERS (EXPULSION AND REINSTATEMENT OF)      \"The Guardian, like the Master before him, has not considered it advisable  to as yet permit any person or Assembly to put another person out of the  Cause of God. There is a sharp distinction between depriving a believer of  his voting rights, which is a severe disciplinary measure and not a  spiritual sanction, and pronouncing a former believer to be a truly  spiritually diseased soul, a soul in the condition the Master referred to  when, in His last cable to America before His ascension, He said: 'He who  sitteth with a leper catcheth leprosy.' The Guardian has, within the last  few years, considered the National Assemblies strong enough to wield the  instrument of sanction in the sense of depriving a Baha'i of his voting  rights. But no one but himself can pronounce a person to be in that  diseased condition we call 'Covenant Breaking' and no one but he can  reinstate a Covenant Breaker. No National Assembly has been given this  right and cannot therefore review the question or reinstate anyone...\"            45: COVENANT BREAKERS (SHUN)      \"...Baha'u'llah and the Master in many places and very emphatically have  told us to shun entirely all Covenant breakers as they are afflicted with  what we might try and define as a contagious spiritual disease; they have  also told us, however, to pray for them. These souls are not lost forever.  In the Aqdas, Baha'u'llah says that God will forgive Mirza Yahya if he  repents. It follows, therefore, that God will forgive any soul if he  repents. Most of them don't want to repent, unfortunately. If the leaders  can be forgiven it goes without saying that their followers can also be  forgiven...    \"Also, it has nothing to do with unity in the Cause; if a man cuts a  cancer out of his body to preserve his health and very life, no one would  suggest that for the sake of unity it should be reintroduced into the  otherwise healthy organism. On the contrary, what was once a part of him  has so radically changed as to have become a poison.\"            46: CRIMSON BOOK (THE)      \"Unfortunately it would seem that the knowledge 'which could largely  eliminate fear' has not been disclosed or identified by Baha'u'llah, so we  do not know what it is.    \"However, what Baha'u'llah did not elaborate but what He meant by the  'world' recorded in the"]]]
