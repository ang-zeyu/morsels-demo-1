A  German  \"Aviatik\" biplane passed overhead and  a French biplane with a machine-gun  went  at  it,  There was  a  hot  contest  until  suddenly a  French  shot  struck  the \"Aviatik's\"  motor. Taking  fire instantly,  the German  craft  fell  blazing  to  the ground,  where  it  burned  to  a cinder  with  its  airmen.--[Drawn by Georges Scott from an Eye Witness's Sketch.]          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--15      [Illustration: \"MISSING AND WOUNDED,\" AT BRUGES: STRICKEN BELGIANS IN  CHARGE OF GERMAN RED CROSS MEN.]    The German base hospital for the troops  in the coast battles and at Ypres  was stationed  at Bruges when  our photograph was taken.  The illustration  shows  two wounded  Belgians--one who  has just  been lifted  out from  an  ambulance-wagon is on a stretcher; the other stands, a grimly picturesque,  overcoated and \"hooded\" figure, in the centre. Among the group of soldiers  are sailor-garbed  men of the Marine  brigade, brought to Flanders  to aid  in  garrisoning Antwerp  and  hold  the coast  batteries  near Ostend  and  Zeebruggen. For  the time being the  entire city of Bruges,  it is stated,  has been converted into one immense hospital owing to the crowds of German  wounded almost hourly  arriving there, while trains  with wounded soldiers  are continually leaving for Germany.--[Photo. by Record Press.]          __________________________________________________________________________  16--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.      [Illustration: NOT EVEN THE DEAD LEFT IN PEACE! GERMAN SHELLS UNEARTH  GRAVES AND SCATTER THEIR CONTENTS IN A VILLAGE CHURCHYARD.]    In our last issue we gave a photograph of a Galician town bombarded by the  Russians, proving that  they carefully avoid the  destruction of churches.  The German gunners, on the contrary, show no respect for the House of God,  although their Emperor so often  claims Divine approval. The havoc wrought  by  German shells  in French  and Belgian  churches and  cathedrals stands  recorded  in countless  photographs  and other  illustrations,  to form  a  permanent Indictment  of Germany's methods  of warfare that will  make her  name execrated by  posterity. In the present instance not  only the church  itself  was  destroyed, but  the  very  graves  were  torn open,  and  the  bodies  and bones  of  the  desecrated dead  flung  from  their places  of  rest--[Facsimile Drawing by H.C.

The toothed edge, he mentions, is  so far from  the point that only  by the rarest chance could  it enter the  body of an enemy. It would be interesting to know whether the two bayonets  British and  German--are exactly  similar. Another  account of  the German  weapon states  that the saw-edge  begins only  six inches from  the point,  quite near  enough thereto, one  would imagine, to  \"enter the body  of an  enemy.\"  Inset is  an enlargement  of the  German saw-bayonet--[Photo.  by  L.N.A.]          __________________________________________________________________________  18--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.      [Illustration: WHERE FRENCH SAILORS FOUGHT AT DIXMUDE: NAVAL-BRIGADE  DEFENCES.]    [Illustration: WHERE FRENCH SAILORS FOUGHT AT DIXMUDE: THE NAVAL  DEFENCES--FRONT VIEW.]    Dixmude, the name of  which little West Flanders town on  the Yser all the  world  knows  now,  after  being heroically  defended  against  persistent  night-and-day  attacks and  bombardments at  all hours,  was taken  by the  reinforced Germans after a forty-hours  renewed attack on November 11. The  defenders, however, held  out in the outskirts of the  town, and could not  be dislodged. The post is not part  of the Allied main line, but rather of  value as a  bridge-head over the river. The French  naval officer who sent  the  photographs shown  above was  one of  the defenders  until he  had to  withdraw wounded.  When he  was there  Dixmude had  been defended  by 6000  French  sailors,  reinforced  at  the  end of  October  by  1500  Algerian  soldiers.          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--19      [Illustration: THE COWHERDS OF WAR: ARMED GERMAN MARINES ROUNDING UP  CATTLE FOR FOOD FOR THE ARMY IN THE FIELD.]    One  of War's  \"little ironies\"  finds illustration  in our  photograph. A  great conflict such  as that now being waged is  full of contrasts: grins,  pathetic, sometimes  not without a  suggestion of humour. That  the German  Marine should be  told off in a  pretty rural district to  round up cattle  for food for the  German troops is a case in point.  The sleek and shapely  kine which these sturdy fellows are commandeering plod peacefully along in  happy ignorance of  the fact that they  are prisoners of war  being led to  their doom by an  armed guard. If it were not for  the significance of the  weapons  borne by  the  Marines, the  scene would  be  as purely  pastoral  as  that immortalised  by  Gray.  It suggests  the  \"lowing herd\"--with  a  difference.--[Photo. by Photopress.]          __________________________________________________________________________  20--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.      [Illustration: THE ATTACK ON THE \"PEGASUS\" BY THE \"KOeNIGSBERG\" (NOW  \"IMPRISONED\"): TRANSHIPPING WOUNDED TO THE HOSPITAL-SHIP \"GASCON.\"]    The \"Pegasus,\" an old and small  cruiser, was attacked and disabled by the  German cruiser \"Koenigsberg\" (recently trapped  by the \"Chatham\" in an East  African river),  a modern ship of  larger size and much  heavier metal, at  daybreak  on September  20, while  anchored in  Zanzibar harbour  to clean  boilers. The \"Koenigsberg\"  stole up during the night,  sheltered behind an  island off  the shore and,  easily outranging  the guns of  the \"Pegasus,\"  shelled  her helpless  opponent.  After  that the  German  ship drew  off,  leaving the \"Pegasus\" in a sinking condition and with 26 men killed and 53  wounded.  Our photograph,  which has  just been  received here,  shows the  \"Pegasus'\" wounded being  transhipped to the Union  Castle liner \"Gascon,\"  serving as a hospital-ship to take the injured to the Cape.          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--21      [Illustration: THE DUEL OF THE ARMED LINERS: THE SHATTERED BRIDGE OF THE  \"CARMANIA\" AFTER HER VICTORY OVER THE \"CAP TRAFALGAR.\"]    The armed liner \"Carmania,\" in her hour and a-half's fight of September 14  with  the  German armed  liner  \"Cap  Trafalgar,\" was  hit  by  73 of  her  opponent's shells, the splinters making, it  is stated, some 380 holes all  over  the vessel.  Offering  so large  a  target to  gun-fire  as did  the  \"Carmania\"--a ship of great length, standing 60 feet out of the water--she  was  saved  from  suffering  more  damage by  the  seamanship  of  Captain  Noel  Grant,  R.N.,  her  Captain,  who kept  her  end-on  to  the  enemy.  Our  photograph of  the  navigating  bridge of  the  \"Carmania,\" with  the  engine-room telegraphs wrecked  and fragments of metal  strewn about, will  give an idea of what those on board went through.

[Illustration: THE GERMAN SCIENCE OF ARSON: INCENDIARY DISKS CARRIED BY  THE KAISER'S SOLDIERS--A SPECIMEN BEFORE AND DURING IGNITION.]    It is clear that the German incendiary outrages in Belgium and France were  premeditated, and German scientists  devised special apparatus for setting  fire to buildings. Our informant, who  bought some incendiary disks from a  German soldier  near Antwerp, states  that every man carries  twenty bags,  each containing  about 300 disks.  Mr. Bertram Blount, the  analyst, found  the disks consist of nitro-cellulose, or gun-cotton. They may be lit, even  when wet,  with a match  or cigarette-end, and  burn for eleven  or twelve  seconds,  emitting  a  strong  five-inch  flame,  and  entirely  consuming  themselves. The  Germans throw  them alight  into houses.  The photographs  show  (1) a  bag of  disks  as supplied  to  German soldiers;  (2) a  disk  burning; and (3) a disk, actual size, before being used.          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--23      [Illustration: \"BLACK MARIA'S\" LITTLE BROTHER: ONE OF THE GERMAN  15-CENTIMETRE HEAVY POSITION-GUNS IN THE ACT OF FIRING.]    The German heavy \"batteries of position\"  are for the most part armed-with  the  15 cm.,  or 6-inch  howitzer,  throwing a  shell  of 90  lb. with  an  approximate range of 6650 yards.

At the end of each table stands the cook of the mess, to offer the Captain  samples of the  dinner he has prepared. These are  tasted by the officers,  and, with  a hearty exchange  of good  wishes, the procession  passes from  table  to  table. It  is  stated  that the  officers  of  the Grand  Fleet  collectively  subscribed to  provide  Christmas dinners  at  home for  the  children  of their  men.  It  is certain  that  friends  at home  provided  Christmas fare for the crews in the North Sea. Never was there a year when  seasonable goodwill and seasonable good cheer were more desirable.--[_From  a Drawing by S.

Here we see a suspect being  brought through the French lines after having  been found  in a  suspicious position  near our  Allies' artillery.  He is  blindfolded, by means of a sack placed  over his head, so that he may gain  no information en route.--[_Photo. by C.N._]    [Illustration: SPORT AT THE FRONT: BRITISH OFFICERS WITH A \"BAG\" OF  PARTRIDGE AND HARE.]    The British officer, who is once more showing what a magnificent sportsman  and fighter he is  in the field, is not altogether  neglecting sport as he  knows it at home  while he is at the front. Already we  have heard of hare  and partridge shooting near the firing-line; and a pack of fox-hounds have  joined the forces,  for the benefit of the Battle  Hunt Club.--[_Photo. by  Photopress._]          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--17      [Illustration: AT FRANCIS JOSEPH'S FEET FOR LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT:  BELGRADE (SINCE RETAKEN BY THE SERBIANS) ENTERED BY THE AUSTRIANS.]    This drawing by  a German artist shows General Liborius  von Frank (riding  in front  of the  standard-bearer) entering  Belgrade at  the head  of the  Fifth Austrian  Army on December  2. As the  troops passed the  Konak, the  building in the background with a  cupola, they sang the Austrian national  anthem. General  Frank sent the  following message to the  Emperor Francis  Joseph: \"On the occasion of  the sixty-sixth anniversary of your Majesty's  accession permit me to lay at  your feet the information that Belgrade was  to-day occupied  by the troops  of the  Fifth Army.\" Belgrade  remained in  Austrian hands less  than a fortnight. The Serbians recaptured  it after a  desperate  battle.  At Belgrade  they  placed  60,000 Austrians  _hors  de  combat_, and  from December 3 to  15 had captured 274  officers and 46,000  men.          __________________________________________________________________________  18--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: A GERMAN DREAM OF EMPIRE ENDS IN SMOKE: TSING-TAU SET ON  FIRE BY SHELLS FROM JAPANESE HEAVY ARTILLERY.]    This impressive photograph was taken  during the bombardment of Tsing-tau,  Germany's cherished possession in the Far East, which fell to the Japanese  and British arms on  November 7. In the distance the  smoke of her burning  is seen going up to heaven. The  blockade of Tsing-tau began on August 27.  The Japanese  troops landed  in Lao-shan  Bay on  September 18,  the small  British force on the 24th. On the  28th they carried the high ground 2-1/2  miles from the  main German position, and fire was  opened on the fortress  during the first week in October. The general bombardment began on October  31 and lasted till the night of  November 6, when the Japanese stormed the  central fort.  We illustrate  on another  page one  of the  Japanese heavy  siege-guns used at Tsing-tau.--[_Photo. by Record Press._]          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--19      [Illustration: IN THE BATTERIES AGAINST TSING-TAU: A JAPANESE SIEGE-GUN  GETTING THE ORDER BY TELEPHONE TO OPEN FIRE.]    We see here one of the heavy  siege-guns which the Japanese brought up for  the  bombardment of  Tsing-tau  when  about to  open  fire  on the  German  fortress.  The  gun-team of  artillerymen  are  standing  in rear  of  the  piece,  and in  the foreground,  to the  right, is  one of  the detachment  receiving orders by  telephone from the battery-commandant at  his post of  observation.  Profiting  by their  experiences  in  siege-warfare at  Port  Arthur, the Japanese  were fully prepared with a very  large and efficient  siege-gun train to  undertake the attack on Tsing-tau  immediately war was  declared. The  Japanese employed  140 guns  in the  bombardment, including  28-centimetre howitzers and 21 and 15 cm. siege-guns, firing respectively,  11.2-inch, 8.4-inch, and 6-inch shells.--[_Photo. by Record Press._]          __________________________________________________________________________  20--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: HAND-GRENADES SHOT FROM A GUN!--THE AARSEN GRENADE-GUN  BEING LOADED.]    One of the features of the present  war which have been drawn attention to  by \"Eye-Witness\"  in his letters from  the Front, is the  resuscitation of  fighting with hand-grenades on both  sides. Particularly has this been the  case  during the  battles in  Northern France  and Flanders,  wherever the  trenches approached one  another within flinging distance.  There also, on  occasion,  where the  troops facing  one another  were further  apart, and  beyond reach  of a throw  by hand, an  improvised catapult of  the classic  type has  been devised  by our  men for  slinging hand-bombs;  utilising a  metal spring  bent back and held  fast in a  notch, to be released  on the  lighting  of the  fuse.  An illustration  of a  catapult  appeared in  the  \"Illustrated War News\" of December 23.          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--21      [Illustration: HAND-GRENADES SHOT FROM A GUN!--AARSEN GRENADES BURSTING  IN THE OPEN.]    On the  page opposite we give  a photograph of a  Danish experimental gun,  designed at Copenhagen, for firing  Aarsen hand-grenades. The grenades are  shown in the act  of being introduced into the breech  of the weapons, and  the apparatus  for holding each grenade  in the hand is  clearly shown. In  the photograph  above the shells are  seen bursting at a  certain distance  from the firing-point. Our soldiers in the trenches in Flanders, according  to  \"Eye-Witness,\"  have  made improvised  hand-grenades  for  themselves,  utilising empty jam-tins. These are charged with gun-cotton and fused, and  on being  lighted are flung  across among  the Germans in  their trenches.  What  the jam-tin  hand-grenades  look like  the  \"War News\"  illustration  referred to shows, and how they are used with catapults.          __________________________________________________________________________  22--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: READY FOR THE TURKISH ARMY SENT \"TO DELIVER EGYPT\"!

The Canal  is securely  held along its hundred miles of  length. Our illustration shows one of the  several  British  advanced-camps  on  the eastern  bank  (the  Asiatic  or  Sinaitic Peninsula  side), placed there  to prevent a surprise  attack. In  all  cases, our  positions are  well fortified,  and, with  the desert  in  front,  present a  formidable  barrier to  the enemy.  In  support of  the  entrenched camps, movable pontoon-bridges have been constructed at certain  points. These,  with the  permanent railway along  the western  bank, will  enable reinforcements to be thrown across the waterways speedily.]          __________________________________________________________________________                      THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--23      [Illustration: THE MOST POPULAR FRENCH HEROINE OF '70: JULIETTE DODU  (WHO DIED THE OTHER DAY) PARDONED FOR HER GREAT BRAVERY.]    There  has  just  died  upon  her little  farm  at  Clarens,  Switzerland,  \"La  demoiselle  Juliette Dodu  of  Pithiviers,\"  forty-four years  ago  a  telegraphist  who  outwitted  the  German invaders,  was  taken  prisoner,  threatened with death, treated chivalrously  by the \"Red Prince\" Friedrich  Karl, released  on the proclamation of peace, decorated with the  Cross of  the Legion of Honour, and retired to  the little farm, where she ended her  days.
