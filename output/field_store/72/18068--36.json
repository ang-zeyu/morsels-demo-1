In the inscriptions glyphs frequently occur which represent animals  either showing the whole body or simply the head. In the eastern facade  of the Monjas at Chichen Itza there are glyphs for both the king and the  black vulture and the peccary. The macaw and the turtle seem also to be  represented by glyphs in the inscriptions. The _Tun_ period glyph shows  vulture-like characteristics and the _Uinal_ period glyph certainly  resembles the lizard. The glyphs representing the various animal  offerings have already been discussed under a special heading (p. 289).

II    ZOOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION AND ETHNOLOGICAL EXPLANATION OF ANIMAL FORMS.      In the descriptions of the animals which follow the general plan will be  to consider first the identification purely from a zoological point of  view, and, secondly, the connection and, wherever possible, the meaning  of the use of the various animal figures wherever they occur.      MOLLUSCA    FASCIOLARIA GIGANTEA. Representations of this marine shell are found in  several places in the codices. It is the only large _Fusus_-like species  on the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and, indeed, is the largest  known American shell. It is therefore not strange that it should have  attracted the attention of the Mayas and found a place in their  writings. Several figures are shown that represent _Fasciolaria_ (Pl. 1,  figs. 1-9). One in the Codex Vaticanus 3773 (Pl. 1, fig. 3) in common  with those shown in Pl. 1, figs. 2, 6, 9, has the spire represented by  segments of successively smaller size. The species of _Fasciolaria_  occurring on the Yucatan and adjacent coasts is characterized by  numerous prominent bosses or projections on its later whorls, and these,  too, appear in conventionalized form in most of the representations. In  Pl. 1, fig. 2, the second whorl, and in figs. 6, 9, the third whorl is  shown with three stout tubercles in side view, corresponding to those  found in this region of the shell. Figs. 7, 8 (Pl. 1) are glyphs  representing the same species, but as in fig. 4, the spire is omitted,  though the knobs are present. Round spots of color are evidently  intended by the markings on the shells shown in figs. 3, 5, 6 (Pl. 1).  Fig. 5, shows a further modification of the spire, which here is made  like the head of a serpent.    The _Mollusca_ in the codices are not always associated with the water  although this is usually the case. God N (Pl. 1, fig. 1) sitting with  the shell around his body is represented as in the rain and the shells  in Pl. 1, figs. 4, 6, appear under water. The snail (Maya, _[vs]ot_) is  considered by the Nahuas as the symbol of birth and death. The first  idea is well brought out in Pl. 1, fig. 2, where the human figure is  emerging from a shell. The same idea among the Mayas is seen in Pl. 1,  fig. 1, where god N is coming from a shell. As god N is usually  associated with the end of the year, we may have here the complementary  idea of death associated with the shell. The same meaning is brought out  in the Bologna Codex (Pl. 1, fig. 3) where the shell is decorated with  flint points, the symbol of death. As the tortoise is often identified  with the summer solstice, as previously pointed out, so the snail is  associated with the winter solstice.    Foerstemann's identification of the head-dress of god D (Dresden 5c), god  A (Dresden 9c, 13a), and god E (Dresden 11c) as representing snails is  not clear. Stempell (1908, p. 739) also follows the same course thinking  that the knob-like prominences represent the stalked eyes of snails.  This seems quite unlikely as such representations are usually short and  occur in too widely dissimilar connections. Moreover, there are  sometimes three of these instead of but a single pair (Dresden 14a). A  similar attempt has been made by Brinton to identify the head-dress of  the death god (god A) as the snail. The head-dress in Dresden 13a and  13b associated with god A looks far more like the head and upper jaw of  some mammal.    OLIVA. A univalve shell frequently represented is of an oval shape,  pointed at each end, with a longitudinal lip and a short spire at one  extremity. This is doubtless a species of _Oliva_, a marine shell. Mr.  Charles W. Johnson informs us that _O. reticulata_ is the species  occurring on the Yucatan shores, while _O. splendidula_ is found in  other parts of the Gulf of Mexico. Representations of this shell are  shown in Pl. 1, figs. 10-12. In figs. 10, 11, the lip and spire are  apparent but in fig. 12 the lip only is seen as a white fissure against  the general dark background. An earthenware vessel representing a tapir  (Pl. 28, fig. 1) shows a string of _Oliva_ shells about the animal's  neck and similar strings very often decorate the belts worn by the  personages represented on the stelae of Copan.    The shell in the codices is found in most cases to represent zero in the  Maya numerical calculations. Just as a bar has the meaning five, and a  dot one, so the shell often has the signification of zero. This is seen  especially in the numeration by position in the codices (Pl. 1, figs. 7,  8, 10-14).    OTHER MOLLUSCA. In addition to the species just described at least two  or three others occur in the Nuttall Codex, but so conventionalized that  it is out of the question to hazard a guess at their identity. One (Pl.  1, figs. 16, 17) is a bivalve with long pointed shell, another (Pl. 1,  figs. 18-20) is rounder with conventionalized scroll-like markings.  Figs. 21, 22 (Pl. 1) may be a side view of the closed bivalve shown in  figs. 16, 17, or possibly a species of cowry. In like manner, fig. 13 is  probably a side view of the mollusc shown in fig. 14, for it is seen  that in each case the figure showing the two opened valves has a  bipartite extended foot, whereas that of the single valve is simple.  This doubling of the single median foot of the bivalve may be an  artistic necessity for the sake of balance, or perhaps represents both  foot and siphon at the same end. Figs. 23, 24 (Pl. 1) seem to represent  molluscs still further reduced and conventionalized. These molluscs from  the Nuttall Codex (Pl. 1, figs. 15-24) are almost all found represented  in the blue water, whereas those which stand for zero in the Maya  codices have no immediate association with either water or rain.      INSECTA    THE HONEY BEE (_Melipona_). A portion of the Tro-Cortesianus appears to  treat of apiculture, as previously noted, or, at all events, contains  numerous figures of bees, some of which are shown in Pl. 2. As stated by  Stempell (1908, p. 735) this is doubtless a species of _Melipona_,  probably _M. fulvipes_ or _domestica_. It is well known that this bee  was kept by the ancient Mexicans, and what appear to be improvised hives  are shown in Pl. 2, figs. 7, 10, where the combs are noted depending  from the ceiling or walls. These combs are seen to be composed of cells  roughly four-sided for the most part, though in fig. 11 several  hexagonal cells are present in the mass of comb held by the black god,  M. Darwin, in his _Origin of Species_, has called attention to the form  of the comb built by this bee, and considers its irregular cells of from  three to six sides intermediate in their degree of perfection between  those of the bumble bee (_Bombus_) and the honey bee of Europe (_Apis  mellifica_). The _Caban_ form in connnection[TN-4] with the hive in fig.  10 may have some phonetic signifiance[TN-5] as _kab_ is honey in Maya.  This sign occurs very frequently in the pages devoted to apiculture.    The figures of the bees in the codex show a number of interesting  variations. In figs. 1-3, 5, 11, the insect is less conventionalized  than in figs. 4, 6 (Pl. 2). The hairy feet are well indicated as well as  the segmented body and a single pair of wings. All the figures show an  anterodorsal view so that, on account of the size of the first pair of  legs, only the tops of the second pair appear in Pl. 2, figs. 1, 3, 5.  In fig. 2, however, two "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19053"],[0,"Theory of Circulation (#4)"],[1,"quantities sufficient to prevent the natural  combustion by breathing, was brought to my mind in March, 1847, while  searching for the cause of an agonizing paroxysm of sick headache. The  distressed feelings of obstructed life with which I was tossing and  struggling, together with the agonizing pain in the head and pressure on  the stomach, might well arise from such a cause. Standing (for position  is important) in a full current of air from an open window, I commenced  a species of violent artificial breathing, for the purpose of ejecting  the supposed heavy gas, and filling my lungs with pure air. This was  done by contracting the chest on every side to its smallest possible  dimensions, and at the same time throwing out the air violently and from  the bottom of the thorax, as if under the operation of an emetic; then  alternating by opening the chest to its greatest capacity, and drawing  in, by successive inhalations, all the fresh air possible, and pressing  it down to the lowest depths of the lungs. This process at first gave  such intensity and sharpness to the pain in the head, that it required  much resolution to continue it; nevertheless it was persevered in. After  a few minutes, the pain diminished, and soon entirely ceased. This was  followed by free perspiration, and equalized, warmth and circulation.  Perfect repose and quiet sleep ensued. Friends, who a short time before  had seen a countenance like that of a dying person, and knew how slow  was ordinary cure, were astonished, an hour afterwards, to behold, on my  awaking, the full glow of restored health.[6]    On the re-appearance of cholera, during the summer of 1849, my mind was  peculiarly affected, from the belief that a false theory of circulation  prevailed, although there was a true theory, which, if generally  believed, might lead to the knowledge of the cause and cure of this  terrific malady; and thus thousands of lives be saved which would  otherwise be lost. This thought almost distracted me; and believing that  my sex stood in the way of my theory's being acknowledged, I sometimes  wished that it might please God to take me out of the world. Then coming  to better thoughts; I cast away despondency as unworthy of me; and  determined to proceed to the further investigation and development of  the great truth, of which I had, as I believed, been made the unworthy  recipient. I studied my theory anew, while I read the most approved  works on cholera; and I came to the belief that imperfect respiration,  caused by the want of due oxygen in the air, was the principal  predisposing cause of the premonitory symptoms; while the death that  supervened was often caused by the settling of carbonic acid gas, the  residuum of animal combustion, in the lower air-cells of the lungs. The  symptoms of the cholera, as treated by the best writers, were full of  new proofs of the truth of my theory, especially of its last step, the  formation of steam or vapor in the lungs. Without that, the collapse of  cholera was a fearful mystery; with it, everything was plain. With a  coldness that would collapse the lungs, the bowels must naturally be  drawn up (and with dreadful pains) to supply their place. The ghastly  change in the face must occur when cold has condensed its arterial  vapor. If respiration could restore heat, before any lesions had taken  place in the organism, the patient might recover. Then I began rewriting  my theory in a work afterwards published, with the title, \"Respiration  and its Effects, especially in relation to Asiatic Cholera and other  Sinking Diseases.\"    While thus occupied, the debilitating air of the season weighed upon my  health and spirits. I had been affected for about three days with what I  regarded as the ordinary complaints of the season, when one night, after  my family had retired, I found myself suddenly very ill--my symptoms  being coldness, debility, and spasmodic pains. I believed myself to be  attacked with cholera. I efficiently practised the artificial  respiration in fresh air as before described. Gaining strength as I  proceeded, I soon found a death-like coldness giving place to genial  warmth. Violent exercise, with artificial breathing, was kept up some  time, with such rests and full free breathings as nature required; after  which, I slept, perspired profusely, and was well in the morning.    This was an occurrence which sunk deep into my mind; and the more so, as  I could not speak much of it, for the truth was too improbable to be  believed. But the successful issue of this, my first experiment upon the  dreaded disease, prepared me to act with boldness and efficiency in a  case which occurred in my own house about a week after.    On the 14th of August, 1849, Jane Phayre, an Irish woman in my service,  of about twenty-five years of age, having been ill for four days with  diarrhoea, was suddenly struck with what the French call cholera  _foudroyant_--from fright. Alarmed by unwonted sounds near her window in  a basement room, she mounted the window-seat to look out at the top  sash, and found her face close to that of a man dying of cholera, who in  his death-cramps was brought from a steamboat on a litter, and thus  rested upon the pavement. The cover was lifted from his face, and the  sight and the smell struck her with faintness and trembling; and with  difficulty she reached her bed. I was called to go to her quickly by  Eliza Fagan, who said that Jane was very bad. She had a clay-cold  death-look, and a frightful blackness around her eyes. Her face, as I  saw it, was livid, pinched in features, and corpse-like, and her pulse  but a feeble flutter; and she seemed only to breathe from the top of her  lungs. She tried, as she afterwards told me, to say, \"I am dying,\" but  her speech was husky and inarticulate. She says her sight and hearing  were gone; and while Eliza and I were dragging her out of doors, she  could not see the window, and did not feel her feet. We placed her in an  upright position, with her back resting against a board-wall, a fresh  breeze blowing full in her face. Her senses were now partially restored.  I told her to breathe violently, for she must get the bad air out of her  lungs and the good air in; and I showed her how she must do it. At first  she said, \"I can't, for something rises up in the inside.\" When I told  her, sternly, that her life depended on it, and she must, she tried to  obey me. At first, it gave her severe headache, but as soon as deep  breathing was fairly begun, while I was watching her face with intense  anxiety, the color changed from the clay-cold death-look to the full  flush of the warm hue of life, and she joyfully exclaimed, \"Oh! I feel  well!\"    When the removal of carbonic acid gas had made way for oxygen to be  brought to the yet uninjured lungs, the carbon of the venous blood  ignited, the motive power was furnished, the blood was again moved  forward into the arterial system, and the dammed up venous current,  receiving the suction force, rushed on so violently as at times nearly  to produce suffocation; but the struggle was soon over, and the lungs,  free both from carbonic acid gas and an unnatural quantity of venous  blood, once more received pure air--and to the relieved sufferer  respiration became delightful--the circulation passed freely through an  unbroken system--and THE CHOLERA WAS CURED.    Was there, in the whole wide world, another person besides myself who  would have taken such a living corpse, dragged it out of doors, and set  it upright, on feet which could not feel, with the expectation that it  might breathe out death, breathe in life, and be restored? The result is  a proof, _a posteriori_; that the theory on which the experiment was  made is true.    Other cases occurred, where, under different circumstances, cures of  cholera were effected. One, as instantaneous, and in some respects as  remarkable as that of Jane Phayre, was that of my friend and former  pupil, Mrs. Gen. Gould, of Rochester, who sent for me, believing herself  to be dying of cholera. I have her letter, which, by permission, is  published in my work on Respiration; and also a letter from her  physician, Dr. Bloss, of Troy, testifying that her disease was cholera,  and that he had little hope of her restoration. This letter is published  in the appendix of a report on my theory, read in Buffalo, August 8th,  1851, to a convention of the New York State Association of Teachers.    In my journeying to New York city, to attend their previous convention  in August, 1850, an accident obliged me to walk for some distance, in  the middle of a hot day. The convention sat in Hope Chapel, which was  poorly ventilated; and in the evening, I sat under a large gas-burner.  On entering my room at the New-York Hotel, which was on the ground  floor, situated where the only air was from a confined, central  enclosure, I perceived at the only window a strong smell of fresh paint  from the outer walls, so that I was obliged to close it. Being  excessively fatigued, I slept heavily--till at early dawn I awaked to  find myself in a dying state. Attempting to move my arms, they were like  lead by my side--and my breath was but a feeble gasp. Without the  knowledge of my theory--my bane, as many of my friends have thought--I  should then have had no antidote. But I knew where was the destroying  agent, and what was the only means by which I had a chance of removing  it; and I used the little strength I had left to breathe deeper, and  then to strive for a better position. Long and doubtful was the  struggle. It was ten o'clock when, with tottering steps, I got into a  carriage, and sought the free fresh air, which enabled me to take a  little food. In the evening, I went into the Teacher's Convention,  having first ordered from my publisher a sufficient number of my books  on Respiration to present one to each member; and then, at my request, a  Committee of"]]]
