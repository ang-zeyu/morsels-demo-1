However, the mystery was soon solved by my watching Richard's  proceedings. I heard a prolonged hammering and found he was at work upon  the hasp of his cage door. He managed to raise it up higher and higher,  till by a well-directed peck he sent it clear out of the loop of wire  which held it in its place. Still the door was shut, and it required a  good many more pecks to force it open, but he succeeded in time, and out  he flew--delighted to find himself entirely master of the situation.  Then I watched with much amusement his deliberate survey of the room.    I was ill at the time, and he first flew to greet me and talk a little;  he hopped upon my hand, and holding firmly on my forefinger he went  through his usual morning toilette, first an application to his oil  gland, then he touched up all his plumage, drew out his wing and tail  feathers, fluttered himself into shape, and when quite in order he began  to examine the contents of my breakfast tray; took a little sugar,  looked to see if there were any grubs under the tray cloth, peered into  the cream jug, decided that he didn't like the salt, gave me two or  three hard pecks to express his profound affection, and then went off on  a voyage of discovery, _autour de ma chambre_. He squeezed himself  between every ornament on the mantlepiece, flew to the drawers, and  found there some grapes which were very much to his taste; so he was  busy for some time helping himself. He visited every piece of furniture,  threw down all the little items that he could lift, and, as I was  reading, I did not particularly notice what he was about, until he came  on a small table near my bed, and then I heard a suspicious noise, and  turned to find the indefatigable bird with his beak in my ink bottle,  and the sheet already plentifully bespattered with black splashes and  little streams of ink trickling over the table cover; such misplaced  zeal was not to be borne, so Richard had to be caged. When he was seven  months old, his beak began to turn from black to yellow. The colour  began to show first at the base of the beak, and it went on gradually,  until in a month's time it was nearly all yellow, though it was black at  the tip for some time longer. As time went on, Richard's talking powers  increased; he quite upset any grave conversation that might be going on;  his voice dropped at times to a sort of stage whisper, as if he wished  to convey some profound secrets. \"Oh, you little beauty, pretty little  dear, 'ow de doo?\" used to mingle most absurdly with the conversation of  his elders and betters. When he could not have his bath in the  conservatory, I used still to give him his glass dish, which we used  together, for he would never enjoy his ablutions without me, and I  became considerably sprinkled in the process. His delight was to have a  water fight, pecking at my fingers, scolding, as if in a great rage,  using his claws, and all the while calling me \"Dear little Dicky;  beauty; pretty little dear,\" &c., for he had no harder words to scold  with; certainly the effect was most comical. When he supposed he had  gained the victory, he would settle down to a regular bathe, fluttering  and taking headers until he was dripping wet and delightfully happy, and  the next thing would be to perch on one's chair, and shake a regular  shower of drops over one's books or work.    Richard was not, as a rule, at all frightened by noises, or by being  carried about in his cage in strange places, but early one morning, when  he was out in my room, he flew away from the window with a piercing  scream of terror, and hid himself quite in the dark, behind my pillow,  shivering with fright, as if he felt his last hour had come. We found  out, when this had occurred several times, that his _bete noire_ was a  great heron, which used occasionally to leave the lake, and circle round  the house, high up in the air. It could only have been by pure instinct  that Richard was inspired with such terror whenever he saw the great  winged bird, and it showed that artificial training, though it develops  additional powers and habits, in no way interferes with natural  instinct.    The starling has a remarkably active brain; its quickness of movement,  swift flight, and never-tiring activity, all show the working of its  inner mind; but more than that, it seems to be capable of something akin  to reasoning. Richard sometimes dropped a piece of meat on his sanded  floor, and I have often seen him take it up and well rinse it in his  water, till the sand was cleansed away, and then he would swallow it;  and a dry piece of meat he would moisten in the same way. Now this  involved a good deal of mental intuition, and I often wondered whether  he found out that water would remove the sand by accident, or by a  process of thought; in either case, it showed cleverness and  adaptability. So also with the processes of opening the door of his  cage. He had first to prize up the latch with his beak to a certain  height, and then by sudden sharp pecks send it clear of the hasp; then  descend to the floor, and by straight pecks send the door open. If he  could not get the door to open thus, he understood at once that the  latch was not clear of the hasp, so he went back to his perch and pecked  at it until he saw it fall down, and then he knew all was right.    When the second summer of Richard's life came round, some young  starlings were obtained, as we much wished to rear a hen as a mate for  Richard in the following year. These birds were placed in a cage in the  same room with him, as we hoped he would prove their tutor, and save us  the trouble of teaching them. But no; Richard evidently felt profoundly  jealous of these intruders, and day after day remained perfectly dumb  and out of temper. This went on for a week, and then fearing he might  lose his talking powers, I was obliged to remove them and pay special  attention to him, to soothe his ruffled feelings. He did not begin to  talk until more than a week had passed by, evidently resolving to mark  in this way his extreme displeasure at others being admitted to share  our friendship--a curious instance of innate jealousy in a bird's mind.    For more than five years Richard was a source of constant pleasure and  amusement, and was so much a part of my home-life that when anything  unusual happened, in the way of a garden-party or a change in daily  events from any cause, one's first thought was to provide for his  comfort being undisturbed. I confess I dreaded the thought of his  growing old, and could not bear to look on to the time when I must learn  to do without his sweet, cheering little voice and pleasant  companionship. Alas! that time has come, and I must now tell how the  little life was quenched.    In a room to which he had access, there was a small aquarium half-full  of water thickly covered with pond-weed. I had left Richard to have his  usual bath whilst I went down to breakfast, and when I returned I could  nowhere find my pet. His usual bath was unused; I called and searched,  and at last in the adjoining room I saw the little motionless body  floating in the aquarium. The temptation had been too strong; Richard  thought to have a lovely bathe, had flown down into the water, no doubt  his claws were hopelessly entangled in the weed and thus, as was the  case with my former starling Dick, the intense love of bathing led to a  fatal end.    The sorrow one feels for the loss of a pet so interwoven with one's life  is very real; many may smile at it and call it weakness, but true lovers  of animals and birds will know what a blank is felt and how intensely I  shall ever regret the untimely fate of my much-loved little Richard.          [Illustration]    VERDANT.      One day in early summer I found on a gravel walk a poor little unfledged  birdie, sitting calmly looking up into the air, as if he hoped that some  help would come to him, some pitying hand and heart have compassion upon  his desolate condition.    I carried him indoors, and \"mothered\" the little helpless thing as well  as I could, by feeding him with hard-boiled yolk of egg mixed with brown  bread and water. Being a hard-billed bird, I supposed that would be  suitable food, and certainly he throve upon it. The little blue quills  began to tell of coming feathers, his vigorous chirpings betokened  plenty of vocal power, and in due time he grew into a young greenfinch  of the most irrepressible and enterprising character. His lovely hues of  green and yellow led to the name of Verdant being bestowed upon him, and  his early experiences made it a somewhat suitable name.    Poor little man! he had no parents to instruct him, and he consequently  got into all manner of scrapes. He only learnt the nature of windows and  looking-glasses by bitter experience; flying against them with great  force, he was often taken up for dead; but his solid little skull  resisted all these concussions, and by pouring cold water upon his head  and some down his throat, he always managed to recover. He once  overbalanced into a bath, and was nearly drowned; he fell behind a  wardrobe, and was nearly suffocated; later on he almost squeezed himself  to death between the bars of his cage--in fact, he had endless escapes  of various kinds. He was very amusing in his early youth. Whilst I was  dressing he would delight in picking up my scissors, pins, buttonhook,  and anything else he could lift, and would carry them to the edge of the  dressing-table and throw them down, turning his sly little head to see  where they had fallen. He delighted in mischief, and was ever on the  watch to carry off or misplace things; and yet he was a winning little  pet, fearless in his confidence, perching on one's head or shoulder, and  hindering all dressing operations by calmly placing his little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21137"],[0,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life (#4)"],[1,"us in the distance, and more than one boy was already strolling  out in our direction to witness the finish.    How we wished we were as fresh as they!    \"Put it on, hares!\" shouted the first who met us, \"you'll do it yet.\"    \"Hounds are gaining!\" cried the next we passed--a young urchin sitting  on a bank and eating toffee.    And now there met us not single spectators only, but groups, who cheered  loudly, backing, some the hares and some the hounds, till we hardly knew  where we were.  Some even began to run along with us, at a respectful  distance, in order to be \"in at the death.\"    The playground wall was now visible only half a mile away, on the other  side of the Gravelshire Canal, which had to be crossed by a bridge which  we were fast approaching.    I gave a rapid look back.  Forwood was now only a hundred yards behind  us, with lots of running still in him.  He would certainly run us down  in the next half-mile.    \"Birch,\" I said, as I ran beside him, \"are you good for a swim?\"    \"Rather!\" he exclaimed; \"if you are.  Quick!\"    We swerved suddenly in our course, and, to the amazement of all  spectators, left the bridge on our left.  In another minute we were on  the margin of the canal, and the next moment the splash of a double  \"header,\" and the shouts of the assembled onlookers, proclaimed that we  had made a plunge for it.  The canal was only about thirty feet wide,  and we were across it in a twinkling, our light flannel clothes scarcely  interfering with our swimming, and certainly not adding much to the  weight we carried after being soaked through.    Three hundred yards now!  Ah! that cheer behind means that Forwood has  followed our plunge.  What are they laughing at, though?  Can he have  foundered?  No!  Another shout!  That means he is safe over, and hard at  our heels.    For the last three hundred yards we run a regular steeplechase.  The  meadows are intersected with lines of hurdles, and these we take one  after another in our run, as hard as we can.  Only one more, and then we  are safe!    Suddenly I find myself on my face on the grass!  I have caught on the  last hurdle, and come to grief!    Birch in an instant hauls me to my feet, just as Forwood rises to the  leap.  Then for a hundred yards it is a race for very life.  What a  shouting there is! and what a rushing of boys and waving of caps pass  before our eyes!  On comes Forwood, the gallant hound, at our heels; we  can hear him behind us distinctly!    \"Now you have them!\" shouts one.    \"One spurt more, hares!\" cries another, \"and you are safe!\"    On we bound, and on comes the pursuer, not ten yards behind--not _ten_,  but more than _five_.  And that five he never makes up till Birch and I  are safe inside the school-gates, winners by a neck--and a neck only--of  that famous hunt.    The pack came straggling in for the next hour, amid the cheers and  chaffing of the boys.  Three of them, who had kept neck and neck all the  way, were only two minutes behind Forwood; but they had shirked the  swim, and taken the higher and drier course--as, indeed, most of the  other hounds did--by way of the bridge.  Ten minutes after them one  other fellow turned up, and a quarter of an hour later three more; and  so on until the whole pack had run, or walked, or limped, or ridden  home--all except one, little Jim Barlow, the tiniest and youngest and  pluckiest little hound that ever crossed country.  We were all anxious  to know what had become of this small chap of thirteen, who, some one  said, ought never to have been allowed to start on such a big run, with  his little legs.  \"Wait a bit,\" said Forwood; \"Jim will turn up before  long, safe and sound, you'll see.\"    It was nearly dusk, and a good two hours after the finish.  We were  sitting in the big hall, talking and laughing over the events of the  afternoon, when there came a sound of feet on the gravel walk,  accompanied by a vehement puffing, outside the window.    \"There he is!\" exclaimed Forwood, \"and, I declare, running still!\"    And so it was.  In a minute the door swung open, and in trotted little  Jim, dripping wet, coated with mud, and panting like a steam-engine, but  otherwise as self-composed as usual.    \"How long have you fellows been in?\" he demanded of us, as he sat down  and began to lug off his wet boots.    \"Two hours,\" replied Birch.    The little hero looked a trifle mortified to find he was so far behind,  and we were quite sorry for him.    \"Never mind,\" he said, \"I ran on the scent every inch of the way, and  only pulled up once, at Wincot, for five minutes.\"    \"You did!\" exclaimed one or two voices, as we all stared admiringly at  this determined young hound.    \"Yes; and a nice dance you gave a chap my size over the railway and  across those ditches!  But I didn't miss a single one of them, all the  same.\"    \"But what did you do at the canal?\" asked Forwood.    \"Why, swam it, of course--obliged to do it, wasn't I, if the hares went  that way?  I say, is there any grub going?\"    Plucky little Jim Barlow!  After all, he was the hero of that \"big  hunt,\" though he did come in two hours late.    This was the last big \"hare and hounds\" I ever ran in.  I have many a  time since ridden with a real hunt over the same country, but never have  I experienced the same thrill of excitement or known the same exultation  at success as when I ran home with Birch, two seconds ahead of the  hounds, in the famous Parkhurst Paper-chase of 18 hundred and something.        CHAPTER THREE.    THE PARKHURST BOAT-RACE.    \"Adams is wanted down at the boat-house!\"  Such was the sound which  greeted my ears one Saturday afternoon as I lolled about in the  playground at Parkhurst, doing nothing.  I jumped up as if I had been  shot, and asked the small boy who brought the message who wanted me.    \"Blades does; you've got to cox the boat this afternoon instead of  Wilson.  Look sharp!\" he said, \"as they're waiting to start.\"    Off I went, without another word, filled with mingled feelings of  wonder, pride, and trepidation.  I knew Wilson, the former coxswain of  the school boat, had been taken ill and left Parkhurst, but this was the  first I had ever heard of my being selected to take his place.  True, I  had steered the boat occasionally when no one else could be got, and on  such occasions had managed to keep a moderately good course up the Two  Mile Reach, but I had never dreamed of such a pitch of good fortune as  being called to occupy that seat as a fixture.    But now it wanted only a week of the great race with the Old Boys, and  here was I summoned to take charge of the rudder at the eleventh hour,  which of course meant I would have to steer the boat on the occasion of  the race!  No wonder, then, I was half daft with excitement as I hurried  down to the boathouse in obedience to the summons of Blades, the stroke  of the Parkhurst Four.    I should explain that at Parkhurst we were peculiarly favoured in the  matter of boating.  The River Colven flowed through the town only half a  mile from the school boundaries, and being at that place but a short  distance from the sea, it was some fifty yards broad, a clear, deep  stream, just the sort of water one would choose for rowing.  There was  no lock for six miles or so up, and the few craft which came in from the  sea rarely proceeded beyond Parkhurst; so that we had a long,  uninterrupted stretch of water for our boats, which, as soon as ever the  spring set in, and the weather became too hot for football and hare and  hounds, appeared in force every half-holiday on its surface.    Some of the fellows on such occasions used to amuse themselves by  starting off for a long, leisurely grind up-stream; or else with set  sail to tack down the lower reaches towards the sea; but most of us who  laid claim in any degree to the name of enthusiastic oarsmen, confined  our operations mainly to the Two Mile Reach, on which most of the club  races were rowed, chief of which was the Old Boys' Race, already  referred to.    This race had been instituted some years before my time at the school,  by an old Parkhurstian, who presented a cup, to be rowed for annually,  between the best four-oared crew of the present school, and any crew of  old pupils who had been at Parkhurst within two years.    This race was the all-absorbing topic in our boat-club for several weeks  before the event.  How carefully the crew were selected, how strictly  they trained, how patiently Mr Blunt, one of the masters, and an old  Cambridge oar, \"coached\" or tutored them; how regularly the boat went  over the course morning after morning, before breakfast; how eagerly the  fellows criticised or commended the rowers; how impatiently we all  looked forward to the coming contest!    This year our prospects were doubtful.  The Old Boys had got together a  strong crew, who were reported by some who had been over to see them to  be very fast, and in splendid form; while we, at the last moment, had  had the disadvantage to lose our coxswain and have to fill his place  with a less experienced hand.  Still, the school \"four\" was a good one,  carefully drilled, with plenty of power; one which Mr Blunt pronounced  ought to hold its own with any other average crew.  So, on the whole,  there was no saying how the chances stood.    I found I had all my work before me to get accustomed to my new duties  before the day of the race.  Daily I was out with the four, and several  times besides I was taken over the course in a punt, and carefully shown  all the shallows, and bends, and eddies of the stream, and made familiar  with the ins and outs of either bank.    Luckily, I was a light weight to begin with, so that I did not lose much  by my limited period of training, being indeed not so heavy as the  former coxswain of the boat, whom I had succeeded.    Well, the eventful day came at last.  The Old Boys arrived the day  before, and from the two trial rows which"]]]
