The large, hind-feet tracks point the  direction the animal has taken. Fig. 1 is the track of the caribou, and  shows the print of the dew-claws, which are the two little toes up high  at the back of the foot. It is when the earth is soft and the foot sinks  in deeply that the dew-claws leave a print, or perhaps when the foot  spreads wide in running.    [Illustration: Footprints of animals.    7 Doe    8 Wolf    9 Fox    10 Buck    11 Bear    12 Sheep]    Fig. 3 is the print of the foot of a red squirrel. Fig. 5 is the  fisher's track, and Fig. 12 is that of a sheep. Pig tracks are much like  those of sheep, but wider. When you have learned to recognize the  varying freshness of tracks you will know how far ahead the animal  probably is. Other tracks you will learn as you become more familiar  with the animals, and you will also be able to identify the tracks of  the wild birds.          CHAPTER II    WOODCRAFT    =Trees. Practical Use of Compass. Direction of Wind. Star Guiding. What  to Do When Lost in the Woods. How to Chop Wood. How to Fell Trees.=      =Trees=    While on the trail you will find a knowledge of trees most useful, and  you should be able to recognize different species by their manner of  growth, their bark and foliage.      =Balsam-Fir=    One of the most important trees for the trailer to know is the  balsam-fir, for of this the best of outdoor beds are made. In shape the  tree is like our Christmas-trees--in fact, many Christmas-trees are  balsam-fir.    The sweet, aromatic perfume of the balsam needles is a great aid in  identifying it. The branches are flat and the needles appear to grow  from the sides of the stem. The little twist at the base of the needle  causes it to seem to grow merely in the straight, outstanding row on  each side of the stem; look closely and you will see the twist.    The needles are flat and short, hardly one inch in length; they are  grooved along the top and the ends are decidedly blunt; in color they  are dark bluish-green on the upper side and silvery-white underneath.  The bark is gray, and you will find little gummy blisters on the  tree-trunk. From these the healing Canada balsam is obtained. The short  cones, often not over two inches in length, the longest seldom more than  four inches, stand erect on top of the small branches, and when young  are of a purplish color.    From Maine to Minnesota the balsam-fir grows in damp woods and mountain  bogs, and you will find it southward along the Alleghany Mountains from  Pennsylvania to North Carolina.      =Spruce=    The spruce, red, black, and white, differs in many respects from the  balsam-fir: the needles are sharp-pointed, not blunt, and instead of  being flat like the balsam-fir, they are four-sided and cover the  branchlet on all sides, causing it to appear rounded or bushy and not  flat. The spruce-gum sought by many is found in the seams of the bark,  which, unlike the smooth balsam-fir, is scaly and of a brown color.  Early spring is the time to look for spruce-gum. Spruce is a soft wood,  splits readily and is good for the frames and ribs of boats, also for  paddles and oars, and the bark makes a covering for temporary shelters.      =Hemlock=    This tree is good for thatching a lean-to when balsam-fir is not to be  found, and its bark can be used in the way of shingles.    The cones are small and hang down from the branches; they do not stand  up alert like those of the balsam-fir, nor are they purple in color,  being rather of a bright red-brown, and when very young, tan color. The  wood is not easy to split--don't try it, or your hatchet will suffer in  consequence and the pieces will be twisted as a usual thing. The  southern variety, however, often splits straight.    [Illustration: Horse-chestnut.    Sugar-maple.    Alder.    Ink impressions of leaves.]    [Illustration: Balsam-Fir.    Spruce.    Hemlock.]    [Illustration: White oak.    Linden.    Ink impressions of leaves.]    [Illustration: Pitch-pine and cone.    Sycamore leaf and fruit of sycamore.    (The buttonball.)]      =Pine=    The pine-tree accommodates itself to almost any kind of soil, high, low,  moist, or dry, often growing along the edge of the water.    The gray pine is sometimes used for making the skeleton of a canoe or  other boats, and the white pine for the skin or covering of the skeleton  boat; but for you the pine will probably be most useful in furnishing  pine-knots, and its soft wood for kindling your outdoor fire.    The trees mentioned abound in our northern forests. The birch in its  different varieties is there also, but rarely ventures into the densest  woods, preferring to remain near and on its outskirts. However, none of  these trees confine themselves strictly to one locality.    Oaks, hickory, chestnut, maples, and sycamore are among the useful woods  for campers.    Learn the quality and nature of the different trees. Each variety is  distinct from the others: some woods are easy to split, such as spruce,  chestnut, balsam-fir, etc.; some very strong, as locust, oak, hickory,  sugar-maple, etc.; then there are the hard and soft woods mentioned in  fire-making.    When you once understand the characteristics of the different woods, and  their special qualifications, becoming familiar with only two or three  varieties at a time, the trees will be able to help you according to  their special powers. You would not go to a musician to have a portrait  painted, for while the musician might give you wonderful music he would  be helpless as far as painting a picture was concerned, and so it is  with trees. They cannot all give the same thing; if you want soft wood,  it is wasting your time to go to hardwood trees; they cannot give you  what they do not possess. Know the possibilities of trees and they will  not fail you.      =How to Chop Wood=    Trailing and camping both mean wood-chopping to some extent for  shelters, fires, etc., and the girl of to-day should understand, as did  the girls of our pioneer families, how to handle properly a hatchet, or  in this case we will make it a belt axe. There is a small hatchet  modelled after the Daniel Boone tomahawk, generally known as the \"camp  axe.\" It is thicker, narrower, and has a sharper edge than an ordinary  hatchet. It comes of a size to wear on the belt and must be securely  protected by a well-fitted strong leather sheath; otherwise it will  endanger not only the life of the girl who carries it, but also the  lives of her companions. With the camp axe (hatchet) you can cut down  small trees, chop fire-wood, blaze trees, drive down pegs or stakes, and  chop kindling-wood. Every time you want to use the hatchet take the  precaution to examine it thoroughly and reassure yourself that the tool  is in good condition and that the _head_ is _on firm_ and _tight_; be  positive of this.    Great caution must be taken when chopping kindling-wood, as often  serious accidents occur through ignorance or carelessness. Do not raise  one end of a stick up on a log with the other end down on the ground and  then strike the centre of the stick a sharp blow with the sharp edge of  your hatchet; the stick will break, but one end usually flies up with  considerable force and very often strikes the eye of the worker, ruining  the sight forever. Take the blunt end of your hatchet and do not give a  very hard blow on the stick you wish to break; exert only force  sufficient to break it partially, merely enough to enable you to finish  the work with your hands and possibly one knee. It may require a little  more time, but your eyes will be unharmed, which makes it worth while.  Often children use a heavy stone to break kindling-wood, with no  disastrous results that I know of. The heavy stone does not seem to  cause the wood to fly upward.    [Illustration: Stand on the log when you chop it.    13 14 15 16    17 For safety.    The stump will be like this on top when the tree is down.    How to use the axe.]      =How to Chop Logs=    Practise on small, slender logs, chopping them in short lengths until  you understand something of the woodsman's art of \"logging up a tree\";  then and not until then should you attempt to cut heavier wood.    If you are sure-footed and absolutely certain that you can stand firmly  on the log without teetering or swaying when leaning over, do so. You  can then chop one side of the log half-way through and turn around and  chop the other side until the second notch or \"kerf\" is cut through to  the first one on the opposite side, and the two pieces fall apart. While  working stand on the log with feet wide apart and chop the _side_ of the  log (not the top) on the space in front between your feet. Make your  first chip quite long, and have it equal in length the diameter of the  log. If the chip is short, the opening of the kerf will be narrow and  your hatchet will become wedged, obliging you to double your labor by  enlarging the kerf. Greater progress will be made by chopping diagonally  across the grain of the wood, and the work will be easier. It is  difficult to cut squarely against the grain and this is always avoided  when possible. After you have cut the first chip in logging up a tree,  chop on the base of the chip, swinging your hatchet from the opposite  direction, and the chip will fall to the ground.    Having successfully chopped off one piece of the log, it will be a  simple matter to cut off more. Chop slowly, easily, and surely. Don't be  in a hurry and exhaust yourself; only a novice overexerts and tries to  make a deep cut with the hatchet.    Be careful of the blade of your hatchet; keep it free from the ground  when chopping, to avoid striking snags, stones, or other things liable  to nick or dull the edge.      =How to Fell a Tree=    Content yourself with chopping down only slender trees, mere saplings,  at first, and as you acquire skill, slightly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18544"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#4)"],[1,"Kailouee, who, although perfectly well, would persist in begging for  medicine. These people are continually asking to be doctored when  nothing ails them. En-Noor seems to have taken a fancy to our morning  beverages, and has sent for tea and coffee. I am afraid he will become a  regular customer. Yusuf carried off a bottle of rum from the tent in the  evening, which occasioned a disturbance between the servants and myself.  This worthy is not to be trusted with the care of any strong liquor. The  little Hamadee was privy to the theft. In the course of the evening the  _new moon_ was seen by seven creditable persons, so that in eight days  more we shall have the Feast of the \"Descent of the Koran from Heaven,\"  and four or five days after that we hope to start for Zinder.    _7th._--This was a fine morning, with the thermometer at sunrise in the  tent 70 deg.; outside, 66 deg.. The water has been so cooled during the night  that my hands ached when I washed them. Later in the season it will be  yet colder; and all reports tell us that in Kanou after the rains it is  often very chilly.    His highness the Sultan again was attracted by my tea and marmalade, and  gave me a call. He desired to see once more the portrait of Clapperton,  and told me that Abdallah had five women in Sakkatou, and had left  behind him three children, all boys. The Sultan was excessively friendly  in manner, which induced me to make him another little present of a ring  set with paste, and a small pair of gilt scissors for one of his wives.  He calls me his brother, and manifests increased anxiety to be friendly  with the English. According to him, a short time since the Sheikh of  El-Fadeea, who commanded the attack made on us at the frontier, came  here; and, in consideration of a few presents and compliments, had  promised to exert himself to procure the restoration of our lost or  stolen camels. En-Noor also again talked about the boat. I am in great  hopes that we shall part from him on good terms, and that he will be  true to his protestations. There is generally a companion with the old  gentleman on these visits. This time it was an aged Tanelkum, who  married a sister of the Sheikh and has been settled many years in the  country. We gave him more tea, and also a piece of white sugar, to carry  home.    This evening the Fezzan and Tripoli Arabs had a musical entertainment,  accompanied with dancing, at which Madame En-Noor and several  distinguished ladies of Tintalous assisted. It was the usual singing  business, with Moorish hammering on tambourines. The dance was performed  by men, mostly in imitation of the women, and was also of the usual  inelegant and indelicate description. However, there was a little mixing  of the derwish dances. The thing went off to the great satisfaction of  the Kailouees, and was kept up till midnight.    _8th._--I slept little after the villanous dancing and riot of the  preceding night, and rose late. My occupation this day was completing my  vocabulary of the Kailouee language, of which I expect to collect a  thousand words. My interpreter sometimes gives very curious explanations  when I work with him. The Arabic word which we translate \"Alas!\" coming  under consideration, he observed: \"There is no corresponding word in the  languages of these countries. This word belongs to the Koran and the  next world.\" He means, that the word has only a relation to the torment  of the damned. It is curious that this Arabic term agrees with, or is  like, our word _wail_ (Ar. _weel_), and is the term used by our  translators of the New Testament in describing the torments of the lost,  \"Weeping and _wailing_\" &c.    Of the term \"chaste,\" Yusuf observed, \"There is no such expression in  these languages; all the women are alike, and equally accessible when  danger is absent.\" It is also true that the men place no bounds to their  sensual appetites, and are restrained only by inability. It may be,  however, that the more religious would have some scruples about  intriguing with their neighbours' wives.    When we came to the word \"school\" Yusuf pretended there was not such a  word in Kailouee. He asked, \"Where in Tintalous is there a school?\" The  question, unfortunately, is put with too much truth. The Kailouees  hereabouts seem entirely to neglect education.    I myself observe that the Arabic _booss_ answers exactly to the vulgar  word in English for _kiss_.[3] The name of a raven is one of many  remarkable examples of a word being chosen to imitate in sound some  peculiarity of the thing signified. In this case, _kak_ irresistibly  reminds one of the raven's croaking voice; which we describe by _caw_.  _Kass_, scissors, is also an imitation of the sound produced by this  instrument in cutting.      [3] A good many similarities of this kind, accidental or        otherwise, might be pointed out: _ydrub_ is \"to drub;\"        _kaab_ would be translated, in old English, \"kibe;\"        _ykattah_ is \"to cut;\" _kotta_, \"a cat;\" _bak_, \"a bug;\"        _stabl_, \"a stable,\" &c. &c. I have noticed, also, some        similarities with French words e.g. _ykassar_,        \"casser\"--ED.    In the evening the Sfaxee and Yusuf came to pay us a visit, and related  divers sorts of wonders of this and other countries of Africa. The first  matter concerned us. Eight days ago died in Tintalous an old witch, or  prophetess, a negress, who foretold our arrival, and said to En-Noor, \"A  caravan of Englishmen is on the road from Tripoli, coming to you.\" This  woman for many years was a foreteller of future events. The next thing  we heard referred to the secret societies of Central Africa. Some of the  chiefs of these societies have the power of killing with their eyes. One  of these fellows is known to have gone to a merchant, in whose arms was  sleeping a pretty female slave, and to have entered into conversation  with him, asking him how he was, &c. In the meanwhile the wizard cast  his eyes upon the pretty slave, and its heart withered. This power is  accordingly much dreaded. If, however, any one perceive the incantation  of the wizard, and say, \"Begone, you son of a brach!\" he immediately  flees, like a dog with his tail between his legs.    In parts of Bornou, also, extraordinary things sometimes happen. There  are men in those places who have the power of assuming the shapes of  wild animals. This they do mostly in the nights. Under the form of lions  and leopards, they go to the tents of strangers, and endeavour to lure  them forth by calling out their proper names with a perfect human voice.  If any one is so imprudent as to obey summons and issue forth, he is at  once devoured.    The Sfaxee pledges his word of honour that there was a female slave a  year ago in Mourzuk who killed five of her companions with her looks. On  this a council was held by the merchants and great people of Mourzuk, to  know what to do with her, and the decision come to was to send her back  to Bornou; a happy decision for the poor slave! Lucky for her that she  was not born in some parts of Europe, with her marvellous power. Even  our friend Gagliuffi has not escaped these superstitions of the people  among whom he lives. On my seeing his young turkeys for the first time,  in very considerable numbers, I exclaimed, \"What a host of young turkeys  you have got!\" On this he became quite alarmed, lest I had cast a malign  look upon them, and ejaculated a counter-exclamation, \"Oh, God bless  them!\"    The Sfaxee and Yusuf do not speak very favourably of some parts of  Soudan as to morality. In some districts of Begarmi, Yusuf says, a male  takes the first female he meets with, no matter how near the  relationship. All the women, in fact, are in common. We must receive his  asseverations for what they are worth, on this subject in general, and  on the developements into which he entered. According to him, in those  regions where scarcely any other roof is required but the heavens, there  is no other couch spread than the earth, and no one shuns, in any act of  life, the eyes of his neighbours.    Whilst these wonders of witches and tales of African lewdness were being  related, a thing happened which none could disbelieve, none call in  question. This was the appearance of an immense meteor in the sky,  shooting over half the heavens, with a slight curve, from east to west.  It had a tail like a comet, and around its head burnt a blue light of  excessive brilliancy. This phenomenon appeared at a quarter to eight  o'clock in the evening. I never saw anything like it before, and perhaps  shall never again see its equal. It might have been visible two minutes.  We all cried out with surprise at beholding it. We had our faces towards  the south, and the course of the meteor was across the south, but not  very high, at about the third of the circle of the heavens. Afterwards,  every few minutes, small meteors were seen sporting about in the same  direction, some in a straight line and others descending.    _9th._--The wind of this fine cool morning prevented a visit from  En-Noor. That he might not be disappointed, however, I sent him his  customary tea; and amused myself by hearing the Sfaxee discourse of that  constant subject of conversation, the attack of the Fadeea. According to  him, on that occasion great fear was felt by all the caravan. Most of  our servants had formed the resolution to abandon us. There were,  however, some honourable exceptions; amongst the rest, Said, the great  mahadee, and another. Yusuf and Mohammed Tunisee proposed the plan, that  we three, the Germans, and myself, should be mounted on maharees, and  either conveyed back to Aisou or forward to Tintaghoda, during the  night. Some of the Kailouees wavered, as well as the Tanelkums; but  En-Noor (of our escort) always declared that he would never consent to  our being given up. The next morning, two or three of the assailants  were very bold, and came and called out"]]]
