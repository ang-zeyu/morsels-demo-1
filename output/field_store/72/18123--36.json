When we come to  _franchise_ in reading we reflect rapidly, \"Another of those verbs in  _ise_!\" or to _paralyse,_ \"One of those very few verbs in _yse_!\"  We give  no thought whatever to all the verbs ending in _ize,_ and so save so much  energy for other acquirements.    If we can say, \"This is a violation of such and such a rule,\" or \"This is a  strange irregularity,\" or \"This belongs to the class of words which  substitutes _ea_ for the long sound of _e,_ or for the short sound of _e_.\"    We have an association of the unknown with the known that is the most  powerful possible aid to the memory.  The system may fail in and of itself,  but it more than serves its purpose thus indirectly in aiding the memory.    We have not spoken of the association of word forms with sounds,  the grouping of the letters of words into syllables, and the aid that a  careful pronunciation gives the memory by way of association; for while  this is the most powerful aid of all, it does not need explanation.    The Mastery of Regular Words.    We have spoken of the mastery of irregular words, and in the last paragraph  but one we have referred to the aid which general principles give the  memory by way of association in acquiring the exceptions to the rules.  We will now consider the great class of words formed according to fixed  principles.    Of course these laws and rules are little more than a string of  analogies which we observe in our study of the language.  The language  was not and never will be built to fit these rules.  The usage of the  people is the only authority.  Even clear logic goes down before usage.  Languages grow like mushrooms, or lilies, or bears, or human bodies.  Like these they have occult and profound laws which we can never hope  to penetrate,---which are known only to the creator of all things  existent.  But as in botany and zoology and physiology we may observe  and classify our observations, so we may observe a language, classify  our observations, and create an empirical science of word-formation.  Possibly in time it will become a science something more than empirical.    The laws we are able at this time to state with much definiteness are few  (doubling consonants, dropping silent e's, changing y's to i's, accenting  the penultimate and antepenultimate syllables, lengthening and shortening  vowels).  In addition we may classify exceptions, for the sole purpose of  aiding the memory.    Ignorance of these principles and classifications, and knowledge of the  causes and sources of the irregularities, should be pronounced criminal  in a teacher; and failure to teach them, more than criminal in a  spelling-book.  It is true that most spelling-books do give them in one  form or another, but invariably without due emphasis or special drill,  a lack which renders them worthless.  Pupils and students should be  drilled upon them till they are as familiar as the multiplication table.    We know how most persons stumble over the pronunciation of names in the  Bible and in classic authors.  They are equally nonplussed when called  upon to write words with which they are no more familiar.  They cannot  even pronounce simple English names like _Cody,_ which they call  \"Coddy,\" in analogy with _body,_ because they do not know that in a word  of two syllables a single vowel followed by a single consonant is  regularly long when accented.  At the same time they will spell the word  in all kinds of queer ways, which are in analogy only with exceptions,  not with regular formations.  Unless a person knows what the regular  principles are, he cannot know how a word should regularly be spelled.  A strange word is spelled quite regularly nine times out of ten, and if  one does not know exactly how to spell a word, it is much more to his  credit to spell it in a regular way than in an irregular way.    The truth is, the only possible key we can have to those thousands of  strange words and proper names which we meet only once or twice in a  lifetime, is the system of principles formulated by philologists,  if for no other reason, we should master it that we may come as near as  possible to spelling proper names correctly.      CHAPTER I.    LETTERS AND SOUNDS.    We must begin our study of the English language with the elementary  sounds and the letters which represent them.    Name the first letter of the alphabet---_a_.  The mouth is open and the  sound may be prolonged indefinitely.  It is a full, clear sound,  an unobstructed vibration of the vocal chords.    Now name the second letter of the alphabet---_b_.  You say _bee_ or _buh_.  You cannot prolong the sound.  In order to give  the real sound of _b_ you have to associate it with some other sound,  as that of _e_ or _u_.  In other words, _b_ is in the nature of an  obstruction of sound, or a modification of sound, rather than a simple  elementary sound in itself.  There is indeed a slight sound in the  throat, but it is a closed sound and cannot be prolonged.  In the case  of _p,_ which is similar to _b,_ there is no sound from the throat.    So we see that there are two classes of sounds (represented by two  classes of letters), those which are full and open tones from the vocal  chords, pronounced with the mouth open, and capable of being prolonged  indefinitely; and those which are in the nature of modifications of  these open sounds, pronounced with or without the help of the voice,  and incapable of being prolonged.  The first class of sounds is called  vowel sounds, the second, consonant sounds.  Of the twenty-six letters  of the alphabet, _a, e, i, o,_ and _u_ (sometimes _y_ and _w_)  represent vowel sounds and are called vowels; and the remainder  represent consonant sounds, and are called consonants.    A syllable is an elementary sound, or a combination of elementary  sounds, which can be given easy and distinct utterance at one effort.  Any vowel may form a syllable by itself, but as we have seen that  a consonant must be united with a vowel for its perfect utterance,  it follows that every syllable must contain a vowel sound, even if  it also contains consonant sounds.  With that vowel sound one or  more consonants may be united; but the ways in which consonants may  combine with a vowel to form a syllable are limited.  In general we  may place any consonant before and any consonant after the vowel in  the same syllable: but _y_ for instance, can be given a consonant  sound only at the beginning of a syllable, as in _yet_; at the end  of a syllable _y_ becomes a vowel sound, as in _they_ or _only_.  In the syllable _twelfths_ we find seven consonant sounds; but if  these same letters were arranged in almost any other way they could  not be pronounced as one syllable---as for instance _wtelthfs_.    A word consists of one or more syllables to which some definite  meaning is attached.    The difficulties of spelling and pronunciation arise largely from the  fact that in English twenty-six letters must do duty for some forty-two  sounds, and even then several of the letters are unnecessary, as for  instance _c,_ which has either the sound of _s_ or of _k_; _x,_ which  has the sound either of _ks, gs,_ or _z_; _q,_ which in the combination  _qu_ has the sound of _kw_.  All the vowels represent from two to seven  sounds each, and some of the consonants interchange with each other.    The Sounds of the Vowels.---(1)  Each of the vowels has what is called  a long sound and a short sound.  It is important that these two sets  of sounds be fixed clearly in the mind, as several necessary rules  of spelling depend upon them.  In studying the following table,  note that the long sound is marked by a  s t r a i g h t  l i n e   o v{colon : aft}er the letter, and the short sound by a   c u{g}r{a}ve {accent mark ` }.    _Long          Short_   a:te          a`t   ga:ve         ma`n   na:me         ba`g     the:se        pe`t   m:e           te`n   (com)ple:te   bre`d     ki:te         si`t   ri:ce         mi`ll   li:me         ri`p     no:te         no`t   ro:de         ro`d   so:le         To`m     cu:re         bu`t   cu:te         ru`n   (a)bu:se      cru`st     scy:the       (like)ly`    If we observe the foregoing list of words we shall see that each of the  words containing a long vowel followed by a single consonant sound ends  in silent _e_.  After the short vowels there is no silent _e_.  In each case in which we have the silent _e_ there is a single long  vowel followed by a single consonant, or two consonants combining to  form a single sound, as _th_ in _scythe_.  Such words as _roll, toll,_  etc., ending in double _l_ have no silent _e_ though the vowel is long;  and such words as _great, meet, pail,_ etc., in which two vowels  combine with the sound of one, take no silent _e_ at the end.  We shall consider these exceptions more fully later; but a _single long_  vowel followed by a _single_ consonant _always_ takes silent _e_ at the  end.  As carefully stated in this way, the rule has no exceptions.  The reverse, however, is not always true, for a few words containing  a short vowel followed by a single consonant do take silent _e_;  but there are very few of them.  The principal are _have, give,  {_(I)_ }live, love, shove, dove, above;_ also _none, some, come,_  and some words in three or more syllables, such as _domicile_.    2.  Beside the long and short sounds of the vowels there  are several other vowel sounds.    A has two other distinct sounds:    ª broad, like _aw,_ as in _all, talk,_ etc.    ae Italian, like _ah,_ as in _far, father,_ etc.    Double o has two sounds different from long or short _o_ alone:    long ºo: as in _room, soon, mood,_ etc.    short ºo`, as in _good, took, wood,_ etc.    Ow has a sound of its own, as in _how, crowd, allow,_ etc.;  and _ou_ sometimes has the same sound, as in _loud, rout, bough,_ etc.    (_Ow_ and _ou_ are also sometimes sounded like long _o,_ as in _own,  crow,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#4)"],[1,"'s Brom Dutcher?\"    \"Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some say he  was killed at the storming of Stony Point; others say he was drowned in  a squall at the foot of Anthony's Nose. I don't know; he never came back  again.\"    \"Where's Van Brummel, the schoolmaster?\"    \"He went off to the wars, too, was a great militia general, and is now  in congress.\"    Rip's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home and  friends and finding himself thus alone in the world. Every answer  puzzled him, too, by treating of such enormous lapses of time, and of  matters which he could not understand: war--congress--Stony Point. He  had no courage to ask after any more friends, but cried out in despair,  \"Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle?\"    \"Oh, Rip Van Winkle!\" exclaimed two or three, \"oh, to be sure! that's  Rip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.\"    Rip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of himself, as he went up  the mountain--apparently as lazy and certainly as ragged. The poor  fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and  whether he was himself or another man. In the midst of his bewilderment,  the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and what was his name.    \"God knows,\" exclaimed he, at his wits' end; \"I'm not myself--I'm  somebody else--that's me yonder--no--that's somebody else got into my  shoes--I was myself last night, but I fell asleep on the mountain, and  they've changed my gun, and everything's changed, and I'm changed, and I  can't tell what's my name, or who I am!\"    The bystanders began now to look at each other, nod, wink significantly,  and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was a whisper,  also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing  mischief, at the very suggestion of which the self-important man in the  cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical moment a  fresh, comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the  gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened  at his looks, began to cry. \"Hush, Rip,\" cried she, \"hush, you little  fool; the old man won't hurt you.\" The name of the child, the air of the  mother, the tone of her voice, all awakened a train of recollections in  his mind. \"What is your name, my good woman?\" asked he.    \"Judith Gardenier.\"    \"And your father's name?\"    \"Ah, poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name, but it's twenty years since  he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of  since--his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or  was carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but a  little girl.\"    Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a faltering  voice:    \"Where's your mother?\"    \"Oh, she, too, had died but a short time since; she broke a blood-vessel  in a fit of passion at a New England peddler.\"    There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The honest  man could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter and her  child in his arms. \"I am your father!\" cried he--\"Young Rip Van Winkle  once--Old Rip Van Winkle now! Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle?\"    All stood amazed until an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd,  put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for a moment,  exclaimed, \"Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle--it is himself! Welcome  home again, old neighbor. Why, where have you been these twenty long  years?\"    Rip's story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him  but as one night. The neighbors stared when they heard it; some were  seen to wink at each other, and put their tongues in their cheeks: and  the self-important man in the cocked hat, who when the alarm was over  had returned to the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth, and  shook his head--upon which there was a general shaking of the head  throughout the assemblage.    It was determined, however, to take the opinion of old Peter Vanderdonk,  who was seen slowly advancing up the road. He was a descendant of the  historian of that name, who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the  province. Peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village, and well  versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighborhood.  He recollected Rip at once, and corroborated his story in the most  satisfactory manner. He assured the company that it was a fact, handed  down from his ancestor the historian, that the Catskill Mountains had  always been haunted by strange beings. It was affirmed that the great  Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and country, kept a  kind of vigil there every twenty years, with his crew of the  _Half-moon_; being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his  enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city  called by his name. His father had once seen them in their old Dutch  dresses playing at ninepins in a hollow of the mountain; and he himself  had heard, one summer afternoon, the sound of their balls, like distant  peals of thunder.    To make a long story short, the company broke up and returned to the  more important concerns of the election. Rip's daughter took him home to  live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout, cheery  farmer for a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that  used to climb upon his back. As to Rip's son and heir, who was the ditto  of himself, seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work on  the farm; but showed an hereditary disposition to attend to anything  else but his business.    WASHINGTON IRVING.      =HELPS TO STUDY=    \"Rip Van Winkle\" is the most beautiful of American legendary stories.  Washington Irving, the author, taking the old idea of long sleep, as  found in \"The Sleeping Beauty\" and other fairy tales, gave it an  American setting and interwove in it the legend of Henry Hudson, the  discoverer of the Hudson river, who was supposed to return to the scene  of his achievement every twenty years, together with the shades of his  crew.         I. Where is the scene of this story laid? In which paragraph do you       learn when the incident related in the story took place? Why does       Irving speak of the mountains as \"fairy mountains\"? In which       paragraph do you meet the principal characters? Give the opinion       you form of Rip and his wife. Read sentences that show Rip's good       qualities--those that show his faults. What unusual thing happened       to Rip on his walk? How was the dog affected? Give a full account       of what happened afterward. Tell what impressed you most in this       scene. Read aloud the lines that best describe the scenery.         II. Describe Rip's waking. What was his worst fear? How did he       explain to himself the change in his gun and the disappearance of       Wolf? How did he account for the stiffness of his joints? What was       still his chief fear? Describe the changes which had taken place in       the mountains. With what feeling did he turn homeward? Why? How did       he discover the alteration in his own appearance? How did the       children and dogs treat him? Why was this particularly hard for Rip       to understand? What other changes did he find? What remained       unaltered? How did Rip still account for the peculiar happenings?       Describe Rip's feelings as he turned to his own house, and its       desolation.         III. What change had been made in the sign over the inn? Why? What       important thing was taking place in the village? Why did the speech       of the \"lean fellow\" seem \"perfect jargon\" to Rip? Why did he not       understand the questions asked him? What happened when Rip made his       innocent reply to the self-important gentleman? How did he at last       learn of the lapse of time? What added to his bewilderment? How was       the mystery explained? Note the question Rip reserved for the last       and the effect the answer had upon him. How did Peter Vanderdonk       explain the strange happening? What is the happy ending? Do you       like Rip? Why?      SUPPLEMENTARY READING         Urashima--Graded Classics III.

[Illustration: Photograph by Aldrich    The Great Stone Face]          THE GREAT STONE FACE      I    One afternoon when the sun was going down, a mother and her little boy  sat at the door of their cottage, talking about the Great Stone Face.  They had but to lift their eyes, and there it was plainly to be seen,  though miles away, with the sunshine brightening all its features.    And what was the Great Stone Face? The Great Stone Face was a work of  Nature in her mood of majestic playfulness, formed on the perpendicular  side of a mountain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown together  in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance, precisely to  resemble the features of the human countenance. It seemed as if an  enormous giant, or a [v]Titan, had sculptured his own likeness on the  precipice. There was the broad arch of the forehead, a hundred feet in  height; the nose, with its long bridge; and the vast lips, which, if  they could have spoken, would have rolled their thunder accents from one  end of the valley to the other.    It was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood with  the Great Stone Face before their eyes, for all the features were noble,  and the expression was at once grand and sweet, as if it were the glow  of a vast, warm heart that embraced all mankind in its affections, and  had room for more.    As we began with saying, a mother and her little boy sat at their  cottage door, gazing at the Great Stone "]]]
