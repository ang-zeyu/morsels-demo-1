Soon after their departure from this world, the  essential truth of their teachings was lost sight of and dogmatic  imitations adhered to.    Inasmuch as human interpretations and blind imitations differ widely,  religious strife and disagreement have arisen among mankind, the light of  true religion has been extinguished and the unity of the world of humanity  destroyed. The prophets of God voiced the spirit of unity and agreement.  They have been the founders of divine reality. Therefore if the nations of  the world forsake imitations and investigate the reality underlying the  revealed Word of God they will agree and become reconciled. For reality is  one and not multiple.    The nations and religions are steeped in blind and bigoted imitations. A  man is a Jew because his father was a Jew. The Muhammadan follows  implicitly the footsteps of his ancestors in belief and observance. The  Buddhist is true to his heredity as a Buddhist. That is to say they  profess religious belief blindly and without investigation, making unity  and agreement impossible. It is evident therefore that this condition will  not be remedied without a reformation in the world of religion. In other  words the fundamental reality of the divine religions must be renewed,  reformed, revoiced to mankind.    From the seed of reality, religion has grown into a tree which has put  forth leaves and branches, blossoms and fruit. After a time this tree has  fallen into a condition of decay. The leaves and blossoms have withered  and perished; the tree has become stricken and fruitless. It is not  reasonable that man should hold to the old tree, claiming that its life  forces are undiminished, its fruit unequalled, its existence eternal. The  seed of reality must be sown again in human hearts in order that a new  tree may grow therefrom and new divine fruits refresh the world. By this  means the nations and peoples now divergent in religion will be brought  into unity, imitations will be forsaken and a universal brotherhood in the  reality itself will be established. Warfare and strife will cease among  mankind; all will be reconciled as servants of God. For all are sheltered  beneath the tree of His providence and mercy. God is kind to all; He is  the giver of bounty to all alike, even as His Holiness Jesus Christ has  declared that God \"sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust\"; that is to  say, the mercy of God is universal. All humanity is under the protection  of His love and favor, and unto all He has pointed the way of guidance and  progress.    Progress is of two kinds, material and spiritual. The former is attained  through observation of the surrounding existence and constitutes the  foundation of civilization. Spiritual progress is through the breaths of  the Holy Spirit and is the awakening of the conscious soul of man to  perceive the reality of divinity. Material progress insures the happiness  of the human world. Spiritual progress insures the happiness and eternal  continuance of the soul. The prophets of God have founded the laws of  divine civilization. They have been the root and fundamental source of all  knowledge. They have established the principles of human brotherhood or  fraternity which is of various kinds, such as the fraternity of family, of  race, of nation and of ethical motives. These forms of fraternity, these  bonds of brotherhood are merely temporal and transient in association.  They do not insure harmony and are usually productive of disagreement.  They do not prevent warfare and strife; on the contrary they are selfish,  restricted and fruitful causes of enmity and hatred among mankind. The  spiritual brotherhood which is enkindled and established through the  breaths of the Holy Spirit unites nations and removes the cause of warfare  and strife. It transforms mankind into one great family and establishes  the foundations of the oneness of humanity. It promulgates the spirit of  international agreement and insures Universal Peace. Therefore we must  investigate the foundation reality of this heavenly fraternity. We must  forsake all imitations and promote the reality of the divine teachings. In  accordance with these principles and actions and by the assistance of the  Holy Spirit, both material and spiritual happiness shall become realized.  Until all nations and peoples become united by the bonds of the Holy  Spirit in this real fraternity, until national and international  prejudices are effaced in the reality of this spiritual brotherhood, true  progress, prosperity and lasting happiness will not be attained by man.  This is the century of new and universal nationhood. Sciences have  advanced, industries have progressed, politics have been reformed, liberty  has been proclaimed, justice is awakening. This is the century of motion,  divine stimulus and accomplishment; the century of human solidarity and  altruistic service; the century of Universal Peace and the reality of the  divine kingdom.          THIS RADIANT CENTURY      In the estimation of historians this radiant century is equivalent to one  hundred centuries of the past. If comparison be made with the sum total of  all former human achievements it will be found that the discoveries,  scientific advancement and material civilization of this present century  have equaled, yea far exceeded the progress and outcome of one hundred  former centuries. The production of books and compilations of literature  alone bear witness that the output of the human mind in this century has  been greater and more enlightening than all the past centuries together.  It is evident therefore that this century is of paramount importance.  Reflect upon the miracles of accomplishment which have already  characterized it, the discoveries in every realm of human research,  inventions, scientific knowledge, ethical reforms and regulations  established for the welfare of humanity, mysteries of nature explored,  invisible forces brought into visibility and subjection, a veritable  wonder-world of new phenomena and conditions heretofore unknown to man now  open to his uses and further investigation. The east and west can  communicate instantly. A human being can soar in the skies or speed in  submarine depths. The power of steam has linked the continents. Trains  cross the deserts and pierce the barriers of mountains; ships find  unerring pathways upon the trackless oceans. Day by day discoveries are  increasing. What a wonderful century this is! It is an age of universal  reformation. Laws and statutes of governments civil and federal are in  process of change and transformation. Sciences and arts are being moulded  anew. Thoughts are metamorphosed. The foundations of human society are  changing and strengthening. Today sciences of the past are useless. The  Ptolemaic system of astronomy, numberless other systems and theories of  scientific and philosophical explanation are discarded, known to be false  and worthless. Ethical precedents and principles cannot be applied to the  needs of the modern world. Thoughts and theories of past ages are  fruitless now. Thrones and governments are crumbling and falling. All  conditions and requisites of the past unfitted and inadequate for the  present time, are undergoing radical reform. It is evident therefore that  counterfeit and spurious religious teaching, antiquated forms of belief  and ancestral imitations which are at variance with the foundation of  divine reality must also pass away and be reformed. They must be abandoned  and new conditions be recognized. The morals of humanity must undergo  change. New remedy and solution for human problems must be adopted. Human  intellects themselves must change and be subject to the universal  reformation. Just as the thoughts and hypotheses of past ages are  fruitless today, likewise dogmas and codes of human invention are obsolete  and barren of product in religion. Nay, it is true that they are the cause  of enmity and conducive to strife in the world of humanity; war and  bloodshed proceed from them and the oneness of mankind finds no  recognition in their observance. Therefore it is our duty in this radiant  century to investigate the essentials of divine religion, seek the  realities underlying the oneness of the world of humanity and discover the  source of fellowship and agreement which will unite mankind in the  heavenly bond of love. This unity is the radiance of eternity, the divine  spirituality, the effulgence of God and the bounty of the Kingdom. We must  investigate the divine source of these heavenly bestowals and adhere unto  them steadfastly. For if we remain fettered and restricted by human  inventions and dogmas, day by day the world of mankind will be degraded,  day by day warfare and strife will increase and satanic forces converge  toward the destruction of the human race.    If love and agreement are manifest in a single family, that family will  advance, become illumined and spiritual; but if enmity and hatred exist  within it destruction and dispersion are inevitable. This is likewise true  of a city. If those who dwell within it manifest a spirit of accord and  fellowship it will progress steadily and human conditions become brighter  whereas through enmity and strife it will be degraded and its inhabitants  scattered. In the same way the people of a nation develop and advance  toward civilization and enlightenment through love and accord, and are  disintegrated by war and strife. Finally, this is true of humanity itself  in the aggregate. When love is realized and the ideal spiritual bonds  unite the hearts of men, the whole human race will be uplifted, the world  will continually grow more spiritual and radiant and the happiness and  tranquillity of mankind be immeasurably increased. Warfare and strife will  be uprooted, disagreement and dissension pass away and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19240"],[0,"Bahá'í Prayers (#4)"],[1,"but Thee,  and grant me an ampler share of Thy boundless favors. Verily, Thou art the  Lord of grace abounding.    --The Bab        \"Lord! Pitiful are we, grant us Thy favor; poor,...\"      Lord! Pitiful are we, grant us Thy favor; poor, bestow upon us a share  from the ocean of Thy wealth; needy, do Thou satisfy us; abased, give us  Thy glory. The fowls of the air and the beasts of the field receive their  meat each day from Thee, and all beings partake of Thy care and  loving-kindness.    Deprive not this feeble one of Thy wondrous grace and vouchsafe by Thy  might unto this helpless soul Thy bounty.    Give us our daily bread, and grant Thine increase in the necessities of  life, that we may be dependent on none other but Thee, may commune wholly  with Thee, may walk in Thy ways and declare Thy mysteries. Thou art the  Almighty and the Loving and the Provider of all mankind.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou kind Lord! We are servants of Thy...\"      O Thou kind Lord! We are servants of Thy Threshold, taking shelter at Thy  holy Door. We seek no refuge save only this strong pillar, turn nowhere  for a haven but unto Thy safekeeping. Protect us, bless us, support us,  make us such that we shall love but Thy good pleasure, utter only Thy  praise, follow only the pathway of truth, that we may become rich enough  to dispense with all save Thee, and receive our gifts from the sea of Thy  beneficence, that we may ever strive to exalt Thy Cause and to spread Thy  sweet savors far and wide, that we may become oblivious of self and  occupied only with Thee, and disown all else and be caught up in Thee.    O Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver! Grant us Thy grace and loving-kindness,  Thy gifts and Thy bestowals, and sustain us, that we may attain our goal.  Thou art the Powerful, the Able, the Knower, the Seer; and, verily, Thou  art the Generous, and, verily, Thou art the All-Merciful, and, verily,  Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, He to Whom repentance is due, He Who  forgiveth even the most grievous of sins.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"Remove not, O Lord, the festal board that hath...\"      Remove not, O Lord, the festal board that hath been spread in Thy Name,  and extinguish not the burning flame that hath been kindled by Thine  unquenchable fire. Withhold not from flowing that living water of Thine  that murmureth with the melody of Thy glory and Thy remembrance, and  deprive not Thy servants from the fragrance of Thy sweet savors breathing  forth the perfume of Thy love.    Lord! Turn the distressing cares of Thy holy ones into ease, their  hardship into comfort, their abasement into glory, their sorrow into  blissful joy, O Thou that holdest in Thy grasp the reins of all mankind!    Thou art, verily, the One, the Single, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the  All-Wise.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          PRAYER FOR AMERICA        \"O Thou kind Lord!

These minds and spirits are exhilarated by the  message of Thy glad-tidings. O God! Let this American democracy become  glorious in spiritual degrees even as it has aspired to material degrees,  and render this just government victorious. Confirm this revered nation to  upraise the standard of the oneness of humanity, to promulgate the Most  Great Peace, to become thereby most glorious and praiseworthy among all  the nations of the world. O God! This American nation is worthy of Thy  favors and is deserving of Thy mercy.

Thou seest me,  O my God, with my face set towards Thee at a time when sorrows have  compassed me on every side. I implore Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all  being, and overshadowest all things visible and invisible, by Thy Name  whereby Thou hast subdued the hearts and the souls of men, and by the  billows of the Ocean of Thy mercy and the splendors of the Daystar of Thy  bounty, to number me with them whom nothing whatsoever hath deterred from  setting their faces toward Thee, O Thou Lord of all names and Maker of the  heavens!    Thou beholdest, O my Lord, the things which have befallen me in Thy days.  I entreat Thee, by Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy names and the  Dawning-Place of Thine attributes, to ordain for me what will enable me to  arise to serve Thee and to extol Thy virtues. Thou art, verily, the  Almighty, the Most Powerful, Who art wont to answer the prayers of all  men!    And, finally, I beg of Thee by the light of Thy countenance to bless my  affairs, and redeem my debts, and satisfy my needs. Thou art He to Whose  power and to Whose dominion every tongue hath testified, and Whose majesty  and Whose sovereignty every understanding heart hath acknowledged. No God  is there but Thee, Who hearest and art ready to answer.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Lauded and glorified art Thou, O my God! I entreat...\"      Lauded and glorified art Thou, O my God! I entreat Thee by the sighing of  Thy lovers and by the tears shed by them that long to behold Thee, not to  withhold from me Thy tender mercies in Thy Day, nor to deprive me of the  melodies of the Dove that extolleth Thy oneness before the light that  shineth from Thy face. I am the one who is in misery, O God! Behold me  cleaving fast to Thy Name, the All-Possessing. I am the one who is sure to  perish; behold me clinging to Thy Name, the Imperishable. I implore Thee,  therefore, by Thy Self, the Exalted, the Most High, not to abandon me unto  mine own self and unto the desires of a corrupt inclination. Hold Thou my  hand with the hand of Thy power, and deliver me from the depths of my  fancies and idle imaginings, and cleanse me of all that is abhorrent unto  Thee.    Cause me, then, to turn wholly unto Thee, to put my whole trust in Thee,  to seek Thee as my Refuge, and to flee unto Thy face. Thou art, verily, He  Who, through the power of His might, doeth whatsoever He desireth, and  commandeth, through the potency of His will, whatsoever He chooseth. None  can withstand the operation of Thy decree; none can divert the course of  Thine appointment. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the  Most Bountiful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Is there any Remover of difficulties save God?...\"      Is there any Remover of difficulties save God?

Thou art the Remover of every anguish and the Dispeller of every  affliction. Thou art He Who banisheth every sorrow and setteth free every  slave, the Redeemer of every soul. O Lord!

My Shield and my Shelter in my  woes! My Asylum and Refuge in time of need and in my loneliness my  Companion! In my anguish my Solace, and in my solitude a loving Friend!  The Remover of the pangs of my sorrows and the Pardoner of my sins!    Wholly unto Thee do I turn, fervently imploring Thee with all my heart, my  mind and my tongue, to shield me from all that runs counter to Thy will in  this, the cycle of Thy divine unity, and to cleanse me of all defilement  that will hinder me from seeking, stainless and unsullied, the shade of  the tree of Thy grace.    Have mercy, O Lord, on the feeble, make whole the sick, and quench the  burning thirst.    Gladden the bosom wherein the fire of Thy love doth smolder, and set it  aglow with the flame of Thy celestial love and spirit.    Robe the tabernacles of divine unity with the vesture of holiness, and set  upon my head the crown of Thy favor.    Illumine my face with the radiance of the orb of Thy bounty, and  graciously aid me in ministering at Thy holy threshold.    Make my heart overflow with love for Thy creatures and grant that I may  become the sign of Thy mercy, the token of Thy grace, the promoter of  concord amongst Thy loved ones, devoted unto Thee, uttering Thy  commemoration and forgetful of self but ever mindful of what is Thine.
