As the axe cut sharply through the stem, and divided the  pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and  faintness, and forgetting all its dreams of happiness, in sorrow at  leaving its home in the forest. It knew that it should never again see  its dear old companions, the trees, nor the little bushes and  many-colored flowers that had grown by its side; perhaps not even the  birds. Nor was the journey at all pleasant.    The tree first recovered itself while being unpacked in the courtyard  of a house, with several other trees; and it heard a man say, \"We  only want one, and this is the prettiest. This is beautiful!\"    Then came two servants in grand livery, and carried the fir tree into  a large and beautiful apartment. Pictures hung on the walls, and near  the great stove stood great china vases, with lions on the lids. There  were rocking chairs, silken sofas, large tables covered with pictures,  books, and playthings that had cost a hundred times a hundred dollars;  at least so said the children.    Then the fir tree was placed in a large tub, full of sand; but green  baize hung all around it, so that no one could know it was a tub; and  it stood on a very handsome carpet. Oh, how the fir tree trembled!  What was going to happen to him now? Some young ladies came in, and  the servants helped them to adorn the tree.    On one branch they hung little bags cut out of colored paper, and each  bag was filled with sweetmeats. From other branches hung gilded apples  and walnuts, and all around were hundreds of red, blue and white  tapers, which were fastened upon the branches. Dolls, exactly like  real men and women, were placed under the green leaves,--and the tree  had never seen such things before,--and at the top was fastened a  glittering star, made of gold tinsel. Oh, it was very beautiful. \"This  evening,\" they all exclaimed, \"how bright it will be!\"    \"Oh, that the evening were come,\" thought the tree, \"and the tapers  lighted! Then I should know what else is going to happen. Will the  trees of the forest come to see me? Will the sparrows peep in at the  windows, I wonder, as they fly? Shall I grow faster here, and keep on  all these ornaments during summer and winter?\" But guessing was of  very little use. His back ached with trying; and this pain is as bad  for a slender fir tree as headache is for us.    At last the tapers were lighted, and then what a glistening blaze of  splendor the tree presented! It trembled so with joy in all its  branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and  burnt some of them. \"Help! help!\" exclaimed the young ladies; but  there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire.    After this the tree tried not to tremble at all, though the fire  frightened him, he was so anxious not to hurt any of the beautiful  ornaments, even while their brilliancy dazzled him.    And now the folding doors were thrown open, and a troop of children  rushed in as if they intended to upset the tree, and were followed  more slowly by their elders. For a moment the little ones stood silent  with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy till the room rang;  and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after  another was taken from it.    \"What are they doing? What will happen next?\" thought the tree. At  last the candles burned down to the branches, and were put out. Then  the children received permission to plunder the tree.    Oh, how they rushed upon it! There was such a riot that the branches  cracked, and had it not been fastened with the glistening star to the  ceiling, it must have been thrown down.    Then the children danced about with their pretty toys, and no one  noticed the tree, except the children's maid, who came and peeped  among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten.    \"A story, a story,\" cried the children, pulling a little fat man  toward the tree.    \"Now we shall be in green shade,\" said the man, as he seated himself  under it, \"and the tree will have the pleasure of hearing also; but I  shall only relate one story. What shall it be? Ivede-Avede, or  Humpty-Dumpty, who fell down stairs, but soon got up again, and at  last married a princess?\"    \"Ivede-Avede,\" cried some. \"Humpty-Dumpty,\" cried others; and there  was a famous uproar. But the fir tree remained quite still, and  thought to himself, \"Shall I have anything to do with all this? Ought  I to make a noise too?\" but he had already amused them as much as they  wished.    Then the old man told them the story of Humpty-Dumpty;--how he fell  downstairs and was raised up again, and married a princess. And the  children clapped their hands and cried \"Tell another, tell another,\"  for they wanted to hear the story of Ivede-Avede; but this time they  had only Humpty-Dumpty. After this the fir tree became quite silent  and thoughtful. Never had the birds in the forest told such tales as  Humpty-Dumpty who fell down stairs, and yet married a princess.    \"Ah, yes! so it happens in the world,\" thought the fir tree. He  believed it all, because it was related by such a pleasant man.    \"Ah, well!\" he thought, \"who knows? Perhaps I may fall down too and  marry a princess;\" and he looked forward joyfully to the next evening,  expecting to be again decked out with lights and playthings, gold and  fruit. \"Tomorrow I will not tremble,\" thought he; \"I will enjoy all my  splendor, and I shall hear the story of Humpty-Dumpty again, and  perhaps Ivede-Avede.\" And the tree remained quiet and thoughtful all  night.    In the morning the servants and the housemaid came in. \"Now,\" thought  the fir tree, \"all my splendor is going to begin again.\" But they  dragged him out of the room and upstairs to the garret and threw him  on the floor, in a dark corner where no daylight shone, and there they  left him. \"What does this mean?\" thought the tree. \"What am I to do  here? I can hear nothing in a place like this;\" and he leaned against  the wall and thought and thought.    And he had time enough to think, for days and nights passed, and no  one came near him; and when at last somebody did come, it was only to  push away some large boxes in a corner. So the tree was completely  hidden from sight as if it had never existed.    \"It is winter now,\" thought the tree; \"the ground is hard and covered  with snow, so that people cannot plant me. I shall be sheltered here,  I dare say, until spring comes. How thoughtful and kind everybody is  to me! Still, I wish this place were not so dark and so dreadfully  lonely, with not even a little hare to look at. How pleasant it was  out in the forest while the snow lay on the ground, when the hare  would run by, yes, and jump over me too, although I did not like it  then. Oh! it is terribly lonely here.\"    \"Squeak, squeak,\" said a little mouse, creeping cautiously towards the  tree; then came another, and they both sniffed at the fir tree, and  crept in and out between the branches.    \"Oh, it is very cold here,\" said the little mouse. \"If it were not, we  would be very comfortable here, wouldn't we, old fir tree?\"    \"I am not old,\" said the fir tree. \"There are many who are older than  I am.\"    \"Where do you come from?\" asked the mice, who were full of curiosity;  \"and what do you know? Have you seen the most beautiful places in the  world, and can you tell us all about them? And have you been in the  storeroom, where cheeses lie on the shelf and hams hang from the  ceiling? One can run about on tallow candles there; one can go in thin  and come out fat.\"    \"I know nothing of that,\" said the fir tree; \"but I know the wood  where the sun shines and the birds sing.\" And then the tree told the  little mice all about its youth. They had never heard such an account  in their lives; and after they had listened to it attentively, they  said, \"What a number of things you have seen! You must have been very  happy.\"    \"Happy!\" exclaimed the fir tree; and then, as he reflected on what he  had been telling them, he said, \"Ah, yes! after all, those were happy  days.\" But when he went on and related all about Christmas eve, and  how he had been dressed up with cakes and lights, the mice said, \"How  happy you must have been, you old fir tree.\"    \"I am not old at all,\" replied the tree; \"I only came from the forest  this winter. I am now checked in my growth.\"    \"What splendid stories you can tell,\" said the little mice. And the  next night four other mice came with them to hear what the tree had to  tell. The more he talked, the more he remembered, and then he thought  to himself, \"Yes, those were happy days; but they may come again.  Humpty-Dumpty fell downstairs, and yet he married a princess. Perhaps  I may marry a princess too.\" And the fir tree thought of the pretty  little birch tree that grew in the forest; a real princess, a  beautiful princess, she was to him.    \"Who is Humpty-Dumpty?\" asked the little mice. And then the tree  related the whole story; he could remember every single word. And the  little mice were so delighted with it, that they were ready to jump to  the top of the tree. The next night a great many more mice made their  appearance, and on Sunday two rats came with them; but they said it  was not a pretty story at all, and the little mice were very sorry,  for it made them also think less of it.    \"Do you know only that one story?\" asked the rats.    \"Only that one,\" replied the fir tree. \"I heard it on the happiest  evening of my life; but I did not know I was so happy at the time.\"    \"We think it is a very miserable story,\" said the rats. \"Don't you  know any story about bacon or tallow in the storeroom?\"    \"No,\" replied the tree.    \"Many thanks to you, then,\" replied the rats, and they went their  ways.    The little mice also kept away after this, and the tree sighed and  said, \"It was very pleasant when the merry little mice sat around me  and listened while I talked. Now that is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#4)"],[1,"is pretty from  its propriety, the French cottage, having the same connection with its  climate, country, and people, produces such a contrast of feeling as  bestows on it a beauty addressing itself to the mind, and is therefore  in perfectly good taste. If we are asked why, in this instance, good  taste produces only what every traveler feels to be not in the least  striking, we reply that, where the surrounding circumstances are  unfavorable, the very adaptation to them which we have declared to be  necessary renders the building uninteresting; and that, in the next  paper, we shall see a very different result from the operations of  equally good taste in adapting a cottage to its situation, in one of the  noblest districts of Europe. Our subject will be, the Lowland Cottage of  North Italy.    OXFORD, _Sept., 1837._          II.    THE LOWLAND COTTAGE--ITALY.    \"Most musical, most melancholy.\"      22. Let it not be thought that we are unnecessarily detaining our  readers from the proposed subject, if we premise a few remarks on the  character of the landscape of the country we have now entered. It will  always be necessary to obtain some definite knowledge of the distinctive  features of a country, before we can form a just estimate of the  beauties or the errors of its architecture. We wish our readers to imbue  themselves as far as may be with the spirit of the clime which we are  now entering; to cast away all general ideas; to look only for unison of  feeling, and to pronounce everything wrong which is contrary to the  _humors_ of nature. We must make them feel where they are; we must throw  a peculiar light and color over their imaginations; then we will bring  their judgment into play, for then it will be capable of just operation.    23. We have passed, it must be observed (in leaving England and France  for Italy), from comfort to desolation; from excitement, to sadness: we  have left one country prosperous in its prime, and another frivolous in  its age, for one glorious in its death.    Now, we have prefixed the hackneyed line of Il Penseroso to our paper,  because it is a definition of the essence of the beautiful. What is most  musical, will always be found most melancholy; and no real beauty can be  obtained without a touch of sadness. Whenever the beautiful loses its  melancholy, it degenerates into prettiness. We appeal to the memories of  all our observing readers, whether they have treasured up any scene,  pretending to be more than pretty, which has not about it either a tinge  of melancholy or a sense of danger; the one constitutes the beautiful,  the other the sublime.    24. This postulate being granted, as we are sure it will by most (and we  beg to assure those who are refractory or argumentative, that, were this  a treatise on the sublime and beautiful, we could convince and quell  their incredulity to their entire satisfaction by innumerable  instances), we proceed to remark here, once for all, that the principal  glory of the Italian landscape is its extreme melancholy. It is fitting  that it should be so: the dead are the nations of Italy; her name and  her strength are dwelling with the pale nations underneath the earth;  the chief and chosen boast of her utmost pride is the _hic jacet_; she  is but one wide sepulcher, and all her present life is like a shadow or  a memory. And therefore, or, rather, by a most beautiful coincidence,  her national tree is the cypress; and whoever has marked the peculiar  character which these noble shadowy spires can give to her landscape,  lifting their majestic troops of waving darkness from beside the fallen  column, or out of the midst of the silence of the shadowed temple and  worshipless shrine, seen far and wide over the blue of the faint plain,  without loving the dark trees for their sympathy with the sadness of  Italy's sweet cemetery shore, is one who profanes her soil with his  footsteps.    25. Every part of the landscape is in unison; the same glory of mourning  is thrown over the whole; the deep blue of the heavens is mingled with  that of the everlasting hills, or melted away into the silence of the  sapphire sea; the pale cities, temple and tower, lie gleaming along the  champaign; but how calmly! no hum of men; no motion of multitude in the  midst of them: they are voiceless as the city of ashes. The transparent  air is gentle among the blossoms of the orange and the dim leaves of the  olive; and the small fountains, which, in any other land, would spring  merrily along, sparkling and singing among tinkling pebbles, here flow  calmly and silently into some pale font of marble, all beautiful with  life; worked by some unknown hand, long ago nerveless, and fall and  pass on among wan flowers, and scented copse, through cool leaf-lighted  caves or gray Egerian grottoes, to join the Tiber or Eridanus, to swell  the waves of Nemi, or the Larian Lake. The most minute objects (leaf,  flower, and stone), while they add to the beauty, seem to share in the  sadness, of the whole.    26. But, if one principal character of Italian landscape is melancholy,  another is elevation. We have no simple rusticity of scene, no cowslip  and buttercup humility of seclusion. Tall mulberry trees, with festoons  of the luxuriant vine, purple with ponderous clusters, trailed and  trellised between and over them, shade the wide fields of stately Indian  corn; luxuriance of lofty vegetation (catalpa, and aloe, and olive),  ranging itself in lines of massy light along the wan champaign, guides  the eye away to the unfailing wall of mountain, Alp or Apennine; no cold  long range of shivery gray, but dazzling light of snow, or undulating  breadth of blue, fainter and darker, in infinite variety; peak,  precipice, and promontory passing away into the wooded hills, each with  its tower or white village sloping into the plain; castellated  battlements cresting their undulations; some wide majestic river gliding  along the champaign, the bridge on its breast, and the city on its  shore; the whole canopied with cloudless azure, basking in mistless  sunshine, breathing the silence of odoriferous air.    27. Now comes the question. In a country of this pomp of natural glory,  tempered with melancholy memory of departed pride, what are we to wish  for, what are we naturally to expect in the character of her most humble  edifices; those which are most connected with present life--least with  the past? what are we to consider fitting or beautiful in her cottage?    We do not expect it to be comfortable, when everything around it  betokens decay and desolation in the works of man. We do not wish it to  be neat, where nature is most beautiful, because neglected. But we  naturally look for an elevation of character, a richness of design or  form, which, while the building is kept a cottage, may yet give it a  peculiar air of cottage aristocracy; a beauty (no matter how  dilapidated) which may appear to have been once fitted for the  surrounding splendor of scene and climate. Now, let us fancy an Italian  cottage before us. The reader who has traveled in Italy will find little  difficulty in recalling one to his memory, with its broad lines of light  and shadow, and its strange, but not unpleasing mixture of grandeur and  desolation. Let us examine its details, enumerate its architectural  peculiarities, and see how far it agrees with our preconceived idea of  what the cottage ought to be?    28. The first remarkable point of the building is the roof. It generally  consists of tiles of very deep curvature, which rib it into distinct  vertical lines, giving it a far more agreeable surface than that of our  flatter tiling. The _form_ of the roof, however, is always excessively  flat, so as never to let it intrude upon the eye; and the consequence  is, that, while an English village, seen at a distance, appears all red  roof, the Italian is all white wall; and therefore, though always  bright, is never gaudy. We have in these roofs an excellent example of  what should always be kept in mind, that everything will be found  beautiful, which climate or situation render useful. The strong and  constant heat of the Italian sun would be intolerable if admitted at the  windows; and, therefore, the edges of the roof project far over the  walls, and throw long shadows downwards, so as to keep the upper windows  constantly cool. These long oblique shadows on the white surface are  always delightful, and are alone sufficient to give the building  character. They are peculiar to the buildings of Spain and Italy; for  owing to the general darker color of those of more northerly climates,  the shadows of their roofs, however far thrown, do not tell distinctly,  and render them, not varied, but gloomy. Another ornamental use of these  shadows is, that they break the line of junction of the wall with the  roof: a point always desirable, and in every kind of building, whether  we have to do with lead, slate, tile, or thatch, one of extreme  difficulty. This object is farther forwarded in the Italian cottage, by  putting two or three windows up under the very eaves themselves, which  is also done for coolness, so that their tops are formed by the roof;  and the wall has the appearance of having been terminated by large  battlements and roofed over. And, finally, the eaves are seldom kept  long on the same level: double or treble rows of tiling are introduced;  long sticks and irregular wood-work are occasionally attached to them,  to assist the festoons of the vine; and the graceful irregularity and  marked character of the whole must be dwelt on with equal delight by the  eye of the poet, the artist, or the unprejudiced architect. All,  however, is exceedingly humble; we have not yet met with the elevation  of character we expected. We shall find it however as we proceed.    29. The next point of interest is the window. The modern Italian is  completely owl-like in his habits. All the "]]]
