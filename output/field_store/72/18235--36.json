His heart always opened to kindness, but  harshness always made him defiant.    \"I'll try to make you as little trouble as possible, sir,\" he said. \"I  may make mistakes at first, but I'm willin' to work, and I want to work  my way up.\"    \"That's right, my boy,\" said Mr. Murdock. \"Let that be your  determination, and I am sure you will succeed.\"    \"Before Mr. Murdock begins to instruct you in your duties,\" said Mr.  Rockwell, \"you may go to the post-office, and see if there are any  letters for us. Our box is No. 5,670.\"    \"All right, sir,\" said Dick; and he took his hat at once and started.    He reached Chatham Square, turned into Printing House Square, and just  at the corner of Spruce and Nassau Streets, close by the Tribune Office,  he saw the familiar face and figure of Johnny Nolan, one of his old  associates when he was a boot-black.    \"How are you, Johnny?\" he said.    \"Is that you, Dick?\" asked Johnny, turning round. \"Where's your box and  brush?\"    \"At home.\"    \"You haven't give up business,--have you?\"    \"I've just gone into business, Johnny.\"    \"I mean you aint give up blackin' boots,--have you?\"    \"All except my own, Johnny. Aint that a good shine?\" and Dick displayed  his boot with something of his old professional pride.    \"What you up to now, Dick? You're dressed like a swell.\"    \"Oh,\" said Dick, \"I've retired from shines on a fortun', and embarked my  capital in mercantile pursuits. I'm in a store on Pearl Street.\"    \"What store?\"    \"Rockwell & Cooper's.\"    \"How'd you get there?\"    \"They wanted a partner with a large capital, and so they took me,\" said  Dick. \"We're goin' to do a smashin' business. We mean to send off a ship  to Europe every day, besides what we send to other places, and expect to  make no end of stamps.\"    \"What's the use of gassin', Dick? Tell a feller now.\"    \"Honor bright, then, Johnny, I've got a place at ten dollars a week, and  I'm goin' to be 'spectable. Why don't you turn over a new leaf, and try  to get up in the world?\"    \"I aint lucky, Dick. I don't half the time make enough to live on. If it  wasn't for the Newsboys' Lodgin' House, I don't know what I'd do. I need  a new brush and box of blacking, but I aint got money enough to buy  one.\"    \"Then, Johnny, I'll help you this once. Here's fifty cents; I'll give it  to you. Now, if you're smart you can make a dollar a day easy, and save  up part of it. You ought to be more enterprisin', Johnny. There's a  gentleman wants a shine now.\"    [Illustration]    Johnny hitched up his trousers, put the fifty cents in his mouth, having  no pocket unprovided with holes, and proffered his services to the  gentleman indicated, with success. Dick left him at work, and kept on  his way down Nassau Street.    \"A year ago,\" he thought, \"I was just like Johnny, dressed in rags, and  livin' as I could. If it hadn't been for my meetin' with Frank, I'd been  just the same to day, most likely. Now I've got a good place, and some  money in the bank, besides 'ristocratic friends who invite me to come  and see them. Blessed if I aint afraid I'm dreamin' it all, like the man  that dreamed he was in a palace, and woke up to find himself in a  pigpen.\"          CHAPTER III.    AT THE POST-OFFICE.      The New York Post-Office is built of brick, and was formerly a church.  It is a shabby building, and quite unworthy of so large and important a  city. Of course Dick was quite familiar with its general appearance; but  as his correspondence had been very limited, he had never had occasion  to ask for letters.    There were several letters in Box 5,670. Dick secured these, and,  turning round to go out, his attention was drawn to a young gentleman of  about his own age, who, from his consequential air, appeared to feel his  own importance in no slight degree. He recognized him at once as Roswell  Crawford, a boy who had applied unsuccessfully for the place which  Fosdick obtained in Henderson's hat and cap store.    Roswell recognized Dick at the same time, and perceiving that our hero  was well-dressed, concluded to speak to him, though he regarded Dick as  infinitely beneath himself in the social scale, on account of his former  employment. He might not have been so condescending, but he was curious  to learn what Dick was about.    \"I haven't seen you for some time,\" he said, in a patronizing tone.    \"No,\" said Dick, \"and I haven't seen you for some time either, which is  a very curious coincidence.\"    \"How's boot-blacking, now?\" inquired Roswell, with something of a sneer.    \"Tip-top,\" said Dick, not at all disturbed by Roswell's manner. \"I do it  wholesale now, and have been obliged to hire a large building on Pearl  Street to transact my business in. You see them letters? They're all  from wholesale customers.\"    \"I congratulate you on your success,\" said Roswell, in the same  disagreeable manner. \"Of course that's all humbug. I suppose you've got  a place.\"    \"Yes,\" said Dick.    \"Who are you with?\"    \"Rockwell & Cooper, on Pearl Street.\"    \"How did you get it?\" asked Roswell, appearing surprised. \"Did they know  you had been a boot-black?\"    \"Of course they did.\"    \"I shouldn't think that they would have taken you.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"There are not many firms that would hire a boot-black, when they could  get plenty of boys from nice families.\"    \"Perhaps they might have secured your services if they had applied,\"  said Dick, good-humoredly.    \"I've got a place,\" said Roswell, in rather an important manner. \"I'm  very glad I didn't go into Henderson's hat and cap store. I've got a  better situation.\"    \"Have you?\" said Dick. \"I'm glad to hear it. I'm always happy to hear  that my friends are risin' in the world.\"    \"You needn't class me among your friends,\" said Roswell, superciliously.    \"No, I won't,\" said Dick. \"I'm goin' to be particular about my  associates, now that I'm gettin' up in the world.\"    \"Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded Roswell, haughtily.    \"No,\" said Dick. \"I wouldn't on any account. I should be afraid you'd  want me to fight a duel, and that wouldn't be convenient, for I haven't  made my will, and I'm afraid my heirs would quarrel over my extensive  property.\"    \"How much do you get a week?\" asked Roswell, thinking it best to change  the subject.    \"Ten dollars,\" said Dick.    \"Ten dollars!\" ejaculated Roswell. \"That's a pretty large story.\"    \"You needn't believe it if you don't want to,\" said Dick. \"That won't  make any difference to me as long as they pay me reg'lar.\"    \"Ten dollars! Why, I never heard of such a thing,\" exclaimed Roswell,  who only received four dollars a week himself, and thought he was doing  well.    \"Do you think I'd give up a loocrative business for less?\" asked Dick.  \"How much do you get?\"    \"That's my business,\" said Roswell, who, for reasons that may be  guessed, didn't care to mention the price for which he was working.  Judging Dick by himself, he thought it would give him a chance to exult  over him.    \"I suppose it is,\" said Dick; \"but as you was so partic'lar to find out  how much I got, I thought I'd inquire.\"    \"You're trying to deceive me; I don't believe you get more than three  dollars a week.\"    \"Don't you? Is that what you get?\"    \"I get a great deal more.\"    \"I'm happy to hear it.\"    \"I can find out how much you get, if I want to.\"    \"You've found out already.\"    \"I know what you say, but I've got a cousin in Rockwell & Cooper's.\"    \"Have you?\" asked Dick, a little surprised. \"Who is it?\"    \"It is the book-keeper.\"    \"Mr. Gilbert?\"    \"Yes; he has been there five years. I'll ask him about it.\"    \"You'd better, as you're so anxious to find out. Mr. Gilbert is a friend  of mine. He spoke only this morning of my valooable services.\"    Roswell looked incredulous. In fact he did not understand Dick at all;  nor could he comprehend his imperturbable good-humor. There were several  things that he had said which would have offended most boys; but Dick  met them with a careless good-humor, and an evident indifference to  Roswell's good opinion, which piqued and provoked that young man.    It must not be supposed that while this conversation was going on the  boys were standing in the post-office. Dick understood his duty to his  employers too well to delay unnecessarily while on an errand, especially  when he was sent to get letters, some of which might be of an important  and urgent nature.    The two boys had been walking up Nassau Street together, and they had  now reached Printing House Square.    \"There are some of your old friends,\" said Roswell, pointing to a group  of ragged boot-blacks, who were on the alert for customers, crying to  each passer, \"Shine yer boots?\"    \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"I know them all.\"    \"No doubt,\" sneered Roswell. \"They're friends to be proud of.\"    \"I'm glad you think so,\" said Dick. \"They're a rough set,\" he continued,  more earnestly; \"but there's one of them, at least, that's ten times  better than you or I.\"    \"Speak for yourself, if you please,\" said Roswell, haughtily.    \"I'm speakin' for both of us,\" said Dick. \"There's one boy there, only  twelve years old, that's supported his sick mother and sister for more'n  a year, and that's more good than ever you or I did.--How are you, Tom?\"  he said, nodding to the boy of whom he had spoken.    \"Tip-top, Dick,\" said a bright-looking boy, who kept as clean as his  avocation would permit. \"Have you given up business?\"    \"Yes, Tom. I'll tell you about it some other time. I must get back to  Pearl Street with these letters. How's your mother?\"    \"She aint much better, Dick.\"    \"Buy her some oranges. They'll do her good,\" and Dick slipped half a  dollar into Tom's hand.    \"Thank you, Dick. She'll like them, I know, but you oughtn't to give so  much.\"    \"W"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21653"],[0,"The Eurhythmics of Jaques-Dalcroze (#4)"],[1,"physical powers,  which results from insufficient co-ordination between the mental  picture of a movement and its performance by the body, and these nervous  troubles are just as much the cause as the result of such lack of  harmony. In some cases the brain gives clear and definite impulses, but  the limbs, in themselves healthy, can do nothing because the nervous  system is in confusion. In other cases the limbs have lost the power to  carry out orders sent by the brain, and the undischarged nerve-impulses  disturb the whole nervous system. In other cases again, muscles and  nerves are healthy, but insufficient training in rhythm impedes the  formation of lasting rhythmic images in the brain. To repeat, the causes  of this lack of rhythm all lie in the important but insufficiently  recognized psycho-physiological sphere of the co-ordination of brain,  nerve-paths and muscles.    The objection is sometimes made that rhythmic gymnastics cause  nerve-strain in children. This is not the case. Several brain  specialists have told me that they have effected satisfactory cures with  rhythmic gymnastic exercises.    Rhythm is infinite, therefore the possibilities for physical  representations of rhythm are infinite.           *       *       *       *       *    (ADDRESS TO STUDENTS, _der Rhythmus_, Vol. I, p. 41, _et seq._)    I consider it unpardonable that in teaching the piano the whole  attention should be given to the imitative faculties, and that the  pupil should have no opportunity whatever of expressing his own musical  impressions with the technical means which are taught him.    Whether the teacher himself be a genius is of little importance,  provided he is able to help others to develop their own talents.    One can create nothing of lasting value without self-knowledge. The only  living art is that which grows out of one's own experiences. It is just  the same with teaching; it is quite impossible to develop others until  one has proved one's own powers in every direction, until one has learnt  to conquer oneself, to make oneself better, to suppress bad tendencies,  to strengthen good ones, and, in the place of the primitive being, to  make one more complete who, having consciously formed himself, knows his  powers. Only in proportion as one develops oneself is one able to help  others to develop.    I consider that one does not require to be a genius in order to teach  others, but that one certainly does require strong conviction,  enthusiasm, persistence and joy in life. All these qualities are equally  derived from the control and knowledge of self.    We must, from youth upwards, learn that we are masters of our fate, that  heredity is powerless if we realize that we can conquer it, that our  future depends upon the victory which we gain over ourselves. However  weak the individual may be, his help is required to prepare a way for a  better future. Life and growth are one and the same, and it is our duty  by the example of our lives to develop those who come after us. Let us  therefore assume the responsibility which Nature puts upon us, and  consider it our duty to regenerate ourselves; thus shall we help the  growth of a more beautiful humanity.    I like joy, for it is life. I preach joy, for it alone gives the power  of creating useful and lasting work. Amusement, an excitement which  stimulates the nerves instead of uplifting the spirit, is not necessary  in the life of the artist. Of course one must often let oneself go, and  I should be the last to defend a so-called moral discipline, or a  pedantic rule of monastic severity. For a healthy, active person the joy  of the daily struggle and of work performed with enthusiasm should be  sufficient to beautify life, drive away fatigue and illuminate present  and future. This condition of joy is brought about in us by the feeling  of freedom and responsibility, by the clear perception of the creative  power in us, by the balance of our natural powers, by the harmonious  rhythm between intention and deed. It depends upon our creative  faculties, both natural and acquired, and becomes greater as these grow.  The power of understanding ourselves certainly gives us a sense of  freedom, for it opens a rapid correspondence, not only between  imagination and power of performance, between apperception and feelings,  but also between the various kinds of feelings which dwell in us.        [Illustration: The College.]          THE JAQUES-DALCROZE METHOD      I. GROWTH[1]        [1] For much of the material of this chapter the writer      is indebted to Herr Karl Storck, of Berlin, to whose      book _E. Jaques-Dalcroze, seine Stellung und Aufgabe in      unserer Zeit_, Stuttgart, 1912, Greiner & Pfeiffer, the      reader is directed.      Emile Jaques-Dalcroze was born in Vienna on July 6, 1865, of mixed  parentage, his father being a Swiss from St. Croix in the Jura (hence  the artist name Dalcroze), his mother of German extraction. At the age  of eight his parents brought him to Geneva, where in due course he  became a student at the Conservatoire of Music. His musical education  was continued in Paris under Leo Delibes and in Vienna under Bruckner  and Fuchs. For a short period his studies were interrupted by an  engagement as musical director of a small theatre in Algiers--an  opportunity which he used for study of the peculiar rhythms of Arab  popular music, which he found unusually interesting and stimulating.    Returning to Geneva, he earned, by a life of varied activities as  teacher, writer and composer, a standing which in 1892 brought him the  appointment of Professor of Harmony at the Geneva Conservatoire.    The wider experience which the new sphere of work brought was to a  certain extent a disappointment, for with it came clear evidence of what  had before only been suspected, namely, that the education of future  professional musicians was in many ways radically wrong, in that the  training of individual faculties was made the chief object, without  consideration of whether or no these faculties stood in any close  relation to the inner consciousness of the student. In other words, the  aim of the training was to form means of expression, without  consideration of what was to be expressed, to produce a highly trained  instrument, without thought of the art whose servant it was to be, to  take as primary object a thing of secondary importance, indeed only of  importance at all when consequent on something which the usual training  entirely neglected. The students were taught to play instruments, to  sing songs, but without any thought of such work becoming a means of  self expression and so it was found that pupils, technically far  advanced, after many years of study were unable to deal with the  simplest problems in rhythm and that their sense for pitch, relative or  absolute, was most defective; that, while able to read accurately or to  play pieces memorized, they, had not the slightest power of giving  musical expression to their simplest thoughts or feelings, in fact were  like people who possess the vocabulary of a language and are able to  read what others have written, yet are unable to put their own simple  thoughts and impressions into words. The analogy here is the simplest  use of everyday language; from this to the art of the essayist or poet  is far; so in music--one who has mastered notes, chords and rhythms can  give musical expression to simple thoughts and feelings, while to become  a composer he must traverse a road that only natural talent can render  easy.    Jaques-Dalcroze took the view that technique should be nothing but a  means to art, that the aim of musical education should be, not the  production of pianists, violinists, singers, but of musically developed  human beings, and that therefore the student should not begin by  specializing on any instrument, but by developing his musical faculties,  thus producing a basis for specialized study. This training could only  be obtained by awakening the sense, natural though often latent, for the  ultimate bases of music, namely, _tone_ and _rhythm_. As the sense for  tone could only be developed through the ear, he now gave special  attention to vocal work, and noticed that when the students themselves  beat time to their singing, the work became much more real, that the  pupils had a feeling of being physically in unison with the music,  indeed the feeling of producing something complete and beautiful.  Following up this hint, \"Gesture Songs\" were written, which, it was  found, were performed with surprising ease.    Up to this point movement had only been used as an accompaniment to  music, not as a means of expressing it; the next step was to give the  body a training so refined and so detailed as to make it sensitive to  every rhythmic impulse and able to lose itself in any music. This  co-ordination of movement and music is the essence of the  Jaques-Dalcroze method, and differentiates it from all other methods of  similar aim.    So far only arm movements had been employed, and those merely the  conventional ones of the conductor. The next step was to devise a series  of arm movements, providing a means of clearly marking all tempi from  two beats in the bar to twelve beats in the bar, including such forms as  5/4 7/4 9/4 11/4, and a system of movements of the body and  lower limbs to represent time values from any number of notes to the  beat up to whole notes of twelve beats to the note. From the first the  work aroused keen interest among the students and their parents, and the  master was given enthusiastic help by them in all his experiments; above  all he was loyally aided by his assistant, Fraeulein Nina Gorter. The  Conservatoire authorities, however, were not sympathetic, and it became  necessary to form a volunteer-experimental class, which worked outside  official hours and buildings.    The first public recognition of the method was at the Music"]]]
