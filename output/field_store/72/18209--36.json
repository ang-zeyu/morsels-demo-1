Its affairs were indeed brought to confusion, as the monks  had sided with Hereward, and the Conqueror gave orders for the plunder  of all the goods of the monastery. But the monks purchased from the king  his forgiveness, and the liberty of the place, and the restoration of  what property had been taken away, for the sum of a thousand marks. To  raise this amount they had to sell almost everything in the church of  gold and silver; and the \"Liber Eliensis\" enumerates among precious  objects thus alienated, crosses, altars, shrines, texts, chalices,  patens, basins, brackets, pipes (_fistulas_), cups, salvers, and the  image of the Virgin seated with her Son on a throne, which Abbot Elsin  had wrought of gold and silver. It is true that most, if not all, of  these were recovered in about ten years, for it is on record that the  Norman abbot, Theodwin, refused to accept the abbacy until the king  would restore what had been taken away. This seems to refer to the goods  sold to raise the money demanded as the price of his forgiveness.    When the building of the existing cathedral was commenced there was not  the same necessity as existed in many other cases. There was no ruin to  be rendered serviceable. A church was actually standing and in constant  use. It must therefore have been felt that the importance and wealth of  the foundation demanded a more magnificent minster. When Simeon, the  ninth abbot (1081-1093), was appointed, he found the property of the  abbey still in an unsatisfactory state. Lands really belonging to it  were in many instances held by powerful persons, who under various  pretences defied the rights of the religious house. So the abbot's first  work was to recover these. By help of the king's commission he was  entirely successful. But while inquiries were being instituted, and  proceedings for recovery were being taken, he conceived the design of  erecting a very noble church, and set about laying the foundations of  it. He could not, from his great age, have hoped to see much progress  made, but he did live to see a very considerable portion completed. He  devoted a great part of his private fortune, which was large, to the  work. He began with the transepts. This is in itself sufficient to shew  that there was a choir in use. The regular practice, when a wholly new  church was to be built, was to commence at the east end. The lower part  of both transepts is Simeon's work. It is of plain Early Norman  character, and represents all that is now in existence of what he  erected. From a slight increase in ornamentation in the capitals in the  north transept, we infer that the actual commencement was made in the  south transept. Of course these transepts were of four bays--not as at  present, of three only--the bay in each case nearest the central tower  having been destroyed when the tower fell. That tower was of Norman  date, and is sometimes spoken of as Simeon's Tower. But he cannot have  built the whole of it. If he raised it as high as the great supporting  arches, which is of course possible, there must have been also supports  in all the four adjacent portions of the church, reaching almost to the  summit of the arches, so that he would have had to build at least one  bay of the triforium and clerestory stages. If he did so, all such work  perished with the fall of the tower. It is more probable that he raised  the piers of the tower arches only a few feet higher than the main  arcade of the transepts.    Abbot Simeon's successor, Richard (1100-1107), proceeded with the  building. No abbot had been appointed by William II., and the works had  consequently been suspended for seven years. Notwithstanding many  troubles and distractions (he was actually deposed at a council at  Westminster in 1102, though restored by Papal bull in the next year),  Abbot Richard made great advance in the building of the church. He was  only abbot for seven years. By 1106 he had finished the east end, which  may have terminated in an apse as at Peterborough, and possibly the  tower. On October 17 in that year the remains of Saints Etheldreda,  Sexburga, Ermenilda, and Withburga were solemnly removed to the new  choir, and re-interred in front of the high altar. For some reason not  explained there was no such attendance of high ecclesiastical  dignitaries as was usual on such occasions. The Bishop of Norwich, four  abbots, and one archdeacon were all that could be found to attend the  translation. The account is noteworthy because it describes the orderly  processions from \"the Old Church,\" and the taking the bodies thence one  at a time, \"with singing and praise into the New Church.\" We are not to  conclude from this that the former church was on a different site. The  new buildings were apparently quite close to the former, and possibly  some part of the old church had already been pulled down as the new  choir was being built, and the completion of the aisles of the choir  would necessitate the pulling down of the remainder. But the remains of  the foundress and others must first be removed to their new  resting-place. Both Simeon and Richard, while urging on the church  building, were by no means regardless of the domestic buildings of the  monastery. These were being enlarged and improved at the same time. Two  bays of the nave next to the tower were also the work of Abbot Richard.    Two years after the death of Abbot Richard the bishopric was  constituted. The bishop henceforward was the abbot of the house, though  the superintendence of the domestic concerns of the monastery devolved  upon the prior. Until 1198 the bishops appointed the priors, but  afterwards they were elected by the monks. There was naturally some  difficulty in dividing fairly between the bishop and the monastery the  peculiar rights which were attached to the government of the Isle of  Ely; but all was amicably arranged. As part of the arrangement the  bishops were discharged from all obligation to repair or sustain the  fabric of the church. But numbers of the bishops did contribute largely  to its building and embellishments; and henceforward the works carried  on are assigned to the bishops holding office at the time.    By degrees, during the twelfth century, the building of the nave  advanced. For upwards of sixty years we find no record in the chronicles  of any specific work done at any particular time. When we come to Bishop  Riddell (1174-1189) we read that he \"carried on the new work and Tower  at the West-end of the Church, almost to the top.\" How high this tower  was we cannot tell. It was probably surmounted by a pyramid. A later  bishop, Northwold (1229-1254), removed the original capping and built  the existing Early English stage; so we conclude from the words: \"Ipse  construxit de novo turrim ligneam versus galileam ab opere cementario  usque ad summitatem.\"    The first three bishops ruled for a period of eighty years. This seems  too long a time to assign for the building of the nave, because there is  so little difference in detail as we examine the work from east to west;  and even when later work in a large building is purposely made to  assimilate to what had been built some years before, the experienced eye  can usually discover slight variations in mouldings or ornamentation  which indicate something of a new fashion in architecture. Here we  detect nothing of the sort. We can well understand how much reason there  was at Ely why building work should have been in the twelfth century  intermittent. The troublous times of Henry I. and Stephen were specially  unfavourable to this place. Bishop Hervey, moreover, would have had but  little time to devote to building. The complete constitution of the  bishopric, the regaining possession of property that had been alienated  in the time of Rufus, and the thorough establishment of his temporal  jurisdiction over the isle took up all his time and energies. He was  also constantly abroad in attendance on the king. In the next bishop's  time the disaffected barons assembled in the Isle of Ely, and the bishop  was of their party. The whole district was alternately in the hands of  the king and of the barons. The property of the monastery suffered  greatly by fines and exactions. The bishop himself was constantly moving  about from place to place, and was many times compelled to make a  hurried escape in fear of being apprehended by the king's party. When at  last his peace was made with the king, his submission cost him three  hundred marks. Neither his own resources nor those of the monastery were  sufficient to raise this sum. Some of the treasures of the church had  already been sold. Now the monks were persuaded to part with silver from  S. Etheldreda's shrine and other valuable ornaments, in order to lend  the bishop the sum he required. After the death of King Stephen there  occurred a time of tranquillity. The bishop was advanced in dignity and  became a Baron of the Exchequer. These various considerations make it at  least very probable that no additions to the church of any importance  were made until the reign of Henry II.; and, if so, we may come to the  conclusion that the whole of the nave was built in his reign. The  difference in the style of architecture between the Late Norman and the  Transition to Early English is very noticeable as we look at the  remaining portion of the west front, south of the galilee porch, the  lower stages shewing no trace of anything but pure Norman, while above  we see pointed arches, quatrefoils in circles, and other indications of  the approaching change of style.    Bishop Eustace (1198-1215) made large additions to the fabric at his own  expense. One sentence in the account of his work has given rise to much  controversy: \"Ipse construxit a fundamento novam galileam ecclesiae  Eliensis versus occidentem sumptibus suis.\" Was this the Early English  porch now known as the galilee? Some have thought that this name "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#4)"],[1,"nests are discovered.  A Cuckoo will glide away instantly and  will make no effort to dispute your possession of her treasures.  A  Crow will also fly off, and so will a Wild Duck and some others.  On  the other hand, the Mockingbird, Robin, or Shrike, will raise a great  outcry and bring about her half the birds of the neighbourhood to pour  out on you their vials of wrath, unless you have the good judgment to  retire at once to a respectful distance.  Warblers will flit from bush  to bush uttering cries of distress and showing their uneasiness.  The  Mourning Dove, Nighthawk, and many others will feign lameness and seek  to lead you away in a vain pursuit.  A still larger number will employ  the same means of deception after the young have been hatched, as, for  example, the Quail, Killdeer, Sandpiper, and Grouse.    However much a bird may resent your intrusion on the privacy of its  sanctuary, it is very rare for one to attack you.  I remember, however,  a boy who once had the bad manners to put his hand into a {26}  Cardinal's nest and had a finger well bitten for his misdeed.  Beware,  too, of trying to caress a Screech Owl sitting on its eggs in a hollow  tree; its claws are very sharp, and you will need first-aid attention  if you persist.  Occasionally some bird will let you stroke its back  before deserting its eggs, and may even let you take its photograph  while you are thus engaged.  On one occasion I removed a Turkey  Vulture's egg from beneath the sitting bird.  It merely hissed feebly  as I approached, and a moment later humbly laid at my feet a portion of  the carrion which it had eaten a short time before--a well-meant but  not wholly appreciated peace-offering.    _Lessons to Be Learned._--An infinite variety of interesting things may  be learned by watching birds at their nests, or by a study of the nests  themselves.  How many persons have ever tried to answer seriously the  old conundrum: \"How many straws go to make a bird's nest?\"  Let us  examine critically one nest and see what we find.  One spring after a  red squirrel had destroyed the three eggs in a Veery's {27} nest which  I had had under observation, I determined to study carefully its  composition, knowing the birds would not want to make use of it again.  The nest rested among the top limbs of a little brush-pile and was just  two feet above the ground.  Some young shoots had grown up through the  brush and their leaves partly covered the nest from view.  It had an  extreme breadth of ten inches and was five inches high.  The inner cup  was two and one-half inches deep, and measured the same across the top.  In its construction two small weed stalks and eleven slender twigs were  used.  The latter were from four and one-half to eight inches long.  The main bulk of the nest was made up of sixty-eight large leaves,  besides a mass of decayed leaf fragments.  Inside this bed was the  inner nest, composed of strips of soft bark.  Assembling this latter  material I found that when compressed with the hands its bulk was about  the size of a baseball.  Among the decaying leaves near the base of the  nest three beetles and a small snail had found a home.    {28}    The Veery, in common with a large number of other birds, builds a nest  open at the top.  The eggs, therefore, are often more or less exposed  to the Crow, the pilfering Jay, and the egg-stealing red squirrel.  This necessitates a very close and careful watch on the part of the  owners.  At times it may seem that the birds are not in sight, and that  the eggs are deserted; but let the observer go too near, and invariably  one or both old birds will let him know of their presence by voicing  their resentment and sending abroad their cries of distress.    _Character of Material Used._--A wide variety of material is used by  birds that build open nests.  Cotton and feathers enter largely into  the composition of the lining of a Shrike's nest.  In Florida the  Mockingbird shows a decided preference for the withered leaves and  stems of life-everlasting, better known as the plant that produces  \"rabbit tobacco.\"  The nest of the Summer Tanager is made almost  entirely of grasses, the outer half being green, freshly plucked blades  that contrast strikingly with the {29} brown inner layer with which the  nest is lined.  Many of the Thrushes make use of large flat leaves, and  also of rags and pieces of paper.  Robins stiffen their nests by making  in them a substantial cup of mud, which, when dry, adds greatly to the  solidity of the structure.  On the island of Cape Hatteras there are  many sheep, and many Prairie Warblers of the region make their nests  entirely of wool.    The most dainty structure built, in this country, by the bill and feet  of birds, is the nest made by the Ruby-throated Hummingbird.  When  completed it is scarcely larger than an English walnut, and is saddled  on a small horizontal limb of a tree, often many feet from the ground.  It is composed almost entirely of soft plant fibres, fragments of  spiders' webs sometimes being used to hold them in shape.  The outer  sides are thickly studded with bits of lichen, and practised, indeed,  is the eye of the man or woman that can distinguish it from a knot on a  limb.  Although the Hummingbird's nest is exceedingly frail, there is  nothing on record to show that {30} any great number of them come to  grief during the summer rains.  It is, however, not called upon for a  long term of occupation.  Within a month after the two white eggs are  laid the young depart on their tiny pinions.  Young birds that require  a longer period for growth before leaving the nest are furnished  usually with more enduring abiding places.  {31} In the case of the  Bald Eagle, the young of which do not fly until they are many weeks  old, a most substantial structure is provided.    [Illustration: Nest of the Ruby-throated Hummingbird]    It was on the twentieth of January, a number of years ago, that the  writer was first delighted by the sight of a Bald Eagle's nest.  It was  in an enormous pine tree growing in a swamp in central Florida, and  being ambitious to examine its contents, I determined to climb to the  great eyrie in the topmost crotch of the tree, one hundred and  thirty-one feet above the earth.  By means of climbing-irons and a rope  that passed around the tree and around my body, I slowly ascended,  nailing cleats for support as I advanced.  After two hours of toil the  nest was reached, but another twenty minutes were required to tear  aside enough of the structure to permit climbing up one of the limbs on  which it rested.  In doing this there were brought to view several  layers of decayed twigs, pine straw, and fish bones, showing that the  birds had been using the nest for many years.  Season after season the  huge structure had been enlarged by {33} additions until now it was  nearly five feet in thickness and about four feet across the top.    [Illustration: The Bald Eagle's Eyrie]    [Illustration: Gannets nesting on the cliffs.  Bonaventure Island, Gulf  of St. Lawrence.]    At this date it contained two fledglings perhaps three weeks old.  Having been led to believe that Eagles were ferocious birds when their  nests were approached, it was with feelings of relief that I noticed  the parents flying about at long rifle-range.  The female, which, as is  usual with birds of prey, was the larger of the pair, once or twice  swept within twenty yards of my head, but quickly veered off and  resumed her former action of beating back and forth over the tree-tops  two hundred yards away.    _Nests in Holes._--The members of the Woodpecker family, contrary to  certain popular beliefs, do not lay their eggs in hollow trees but  deposit them in cavities that they excavate for the purpose.  The bird  student will soon learn just where to look for the nest of each  species.  Thus you may find the nesting cavity of the Red-headed  Woodpecker in a tall stump or dead tree; in some States it is a common  bird in towns, and often digs its cavity in a telephone {34} pole.  Some years ago a pair excavated a nest and reared their young in a  wooden ball on the staff of the dome of the State House in Raleigh,  North Carolina.    On the plains, where trees are few, the telegraph poles provide  convenient nesting sites for Woodpeckers of various species.  While  travelling on a slow train through Texas I counted one hundred and  fifty telegraph poles in succession, thirty-nine of which contained  Woodpeckers' holes.  Probably I did not see all of them, for not over  two-thirds of the surface of each pole was visible from the car window.  Not all of these holes, of course, were occupied by Woodpeckers in any  one season.    Flickers, or \"Yellowhammers,\" use dead trees as a rule, but sometimes  make use of a living tree by digging the nest out of the dead wood  where a knot hole offers a convenient opening.  The only place I have  ever known them regularly to nest in living trees is in the deserts of  Arizona, where the _saguaro_ or \"tree cactus\" is about the only tree  large enough to be employed for such a purpose.  In the {35} Northern  States Flickers sometimes chisel holes through the weatherboarding of  ice-houses and make cavities for their eggs in the tightly packed  sawdust within.  They have been known also to lay their eggs in nesting  boxes put up for their accommodation.    In travelling through the pine barrens of the Southern States one  frequently finds grouped about the negroes' cabins and plantation  houses the popular chinaberry, or Pride of India tree.  Here are the  places to look for the nest of the Hairy Woodpecker.  In that country,  in fact, I have never found a nest of this bird except in the dead,  slanting limb of a chinaberry tree.    The member of this family which displays most originality in its nest  building is the Red-cockaded Woodpecker.  It is a Southern bird, and  the abode for its young is always "]]]
