'Tis you, I think,    When the Cigale pierces the vine to drink,    Drive her away, her drink to steal;    And when she is dead--you make your meal!          CHAPTER II    THE CIGALE LEAVES ITS BURROW      The first Cigales appear about the summer solstice. Along the beaten  paths, calcined by the sun, hardened by the passage of frequent feet, we  see little circular orifices almost large enough to admit the thumb.  These are the holes by which the larvae of the Cigale have come up from  the depths to undergo metamorphosis. We see them more or less  everywhere, except in fields where the soil has been disturbed by  ploughing. Their usual position is in the driest and hottest situations,  especially by the sides of roads or the borders of footpaths. Powerfully  equipped for the purpose, able at need to pierce the turf or sun-dried  clay, the larva, upon leaving the earth, seems to prefer the hardest  spots.    A garden alley, converted into a little Arabia Petraea by reflection from  a wall facing the south, abounds in such holes. During the last days of  June I have made an examination of these recently abandoned pits. The  soil is so compact that I needed a pick to tackle it.    The orifices are round, and close upon an inch in diameter. There is  absolutely no debris round them; no earth thrown up from within. This is  always the case; the holes of the Cigales are never surrounded by  dumping-heaps, as are the burrows of the Geotrupes, another notable  excavator. The way in which the work is done is responsible for this  difference. The dung-beetle works from without inwards; she begins to  dig at the mouth of the burrow, and afterwards re-ascends and  accumulates the excavated material on the surface. The larva of the  Cigale, on the contrary, works outward from within, upward from below;  it opens the door of exit at the last moment, so that it is not free for  the discharge of excavated material until the work is done. The first  enters and raises a little rubbish-heap at the threshold of her burrow;  the second emerges, and cannot, while working, pile up its rubbish on a  threshold which as yet has no existence.    The burrow of the Cigale descends about fifteen inches. It is  cylindrical, slightly twisted, according to the exigencies of the soil,  and always approaches the vertical, or the direction of the shortest  passage. It is perfectly free along its entire length. We shall search  in vain for the rubbish which such an excavation must apparently  produce; we shall find nothing of the sort. The burrow terminates in a  cul-de-sac, in a fairly roomy chamber with unbroken walls, which shows  not the least vestige of communication with any other burrow or  prolongation of the shaft.    Taking its length and diameter into account, we find the excavation has  a total volume of about twelve cubic inches. What becomes of the earth  which is removed?    Sunk in a very dry, crumbling soil, we should expect the shaft and the  chamber at the bottom to have soft, powdery walls, subject to petty  landslips, if no work were done but that of excavation. On the contrary,  the walls are neatly daubed, plastered with a sort of clay-like mortar.  They are not precisely smooth, indeed they are distinctly rough; but  their irregularities are covered with a layer of plaster, and the  crumbling material, soaked in some glutinous liquid and dried, is held  firmly in place.    The larva can climb up and down, ascend nearly to the surface, and go  down into its chamber of refuge, without bringing down, with his claws,  the continual falls of material which would block the burrow, make  ascent a matter of difficulty, and retreat impossible. The miner shores  up his galleries with uprights and cross-timbers; the builder of  underground railways supports the sides and roofs of his tunnels with a  lining of brick or masonry or segments of iron tube; the larva of the  Cigale, no less prudent an engineer, plasters the walls of its burrow  with cement, so that the passage is always free and ready for use.    If I surprise the creature just as it is emerging from the soil in order  to gain a neighbouring bough and there undergo transformation, I see it  immediately make a prudent retreat, descending to the bottom of its  burrow without the slightest difficulty--a proof that even when about to  be abandoned for ever the refuge is not encumbered with rubbish.    The ascending shaft is not a hurried piece of work, scamped by a  creature impatient to reach the sunlight. It is a true dwelling, in  which the larva may make a long stay. The plastered walls betray as  much. Such precautions would be useless in the case of a simple exit  abandoned as soon as made. We cannot doubt that the burrow is a kind of  meteorological observatory, and that its inhabitant takes note of the  weather without. Buried underground at a depth of twelve or fifteen  inches, the larva, when ripe for escape, could hardly judge whether the  meteorological conditions were favourable. The subterranean climate  varies too little, changes too slowly, and would not afford it the  precise information required for the most important action of its  life--the escape into the sunshine at the time of metamorphosis.    Patiently, for weeks, perhaps for months, it digs, clears, and  strengthens a vertical shaft, leaving only a layer of earth a finger's  breadth in thickness to isolate it from the outer world. At the bottom  it prepares a carefully built recess. This is its refuge, its place of  waiting, where it reposes in peace if its observations decide it to  postpone its final departure. At the least sign of fine weather it  climbs to the top of its burrow, sounds the outer world through the thin  layer of earth which covers the shaft, and informs itself of the  temperature and humidity of the outer air.    If things are not going well--if there are threats of a flood or the  dreaded _bise_--events of mortal gravity when the delicate insect issues  from its cerements--the prudent creature re-descends to the bottom of  its burrow for a longer wait. If, on the contrary, the state of the  atmosphere is favourable, the roof is broken through by a few strokes of  its claws, and the larva emerges from its tunnel.    Everything seems to prove that the burrow of the Cigale is a  waiting-room, a meteorological station, in which the larva makes a  prolonged stay; sometimes hoisting itself to the neighbourhood of the  surface in order to ascertain the external climate; sometimes retiring  to the depths the better to shelter itself. This explains the chamber  at the base of the shaft, and the necessity of a cement to hold the  walls together, for otherwise the creature's continual comings and  goings would result in a landslip.    A matter less easy of explanation is the complete disappearance of the  material which originally filled the excavated space. Where are the  twelve cubic inches of earth that represent the average volume of the  original contents of the shaft? There is not a trace of this material  outside, nor inside either. And how, in a soil as dry as a cinder, is  the plaster made with which the walls are covered?    Larvae which burrow in wood, such as those of Capricornis and Buprestes,  will apparently answer our first question. They make their way through  the substance of a tree-trunk, boring their galleries by the simple  method of eating the material in front of them. Detached by their  mandibles, fragment by fragment, the material is digested. It passes  from end to end through the body of the pioneer, yields during its  passage its meagre nutritive principles, and accumulates behind it,  obstructing the passage, by which the larva will never return. The work  of extreme division, effected partly by the mandibles and partly by the  stomach, makes the digested material more compact than the intact wood,  from which it follows that there is always a little free space at the  head of the gallery, in which the caterpillar works and lives; it is not  of any great length, but just suffices for the movements of the  prisoner.    Must not the larva of the Cigale bore its passage in some such fashion?  I do not mean that the results of excavation pass through its body--for  earth, even the softest mould, could form no possible part of its diet.  But is not the material detached simply thrust back behind the excavator  as the work progresses?    The Cigale passes four years under ground. This long life is not spent,  of course, at the bottom of the well I have just described; that is  merely a resting-place preparatory to its appearance on the face of the  earth. The larva comes from elsewhere; doubtless from a considerable  distance. It is a vagabond, roaming from one root to another and  implanting its rostrum. When it moves, either to flee from the upper  layers of the soil, which in winter become too cold, or to install  itself upon a more juicy root, it makes a road by rejecting behind it  the material broken up by the teeth of its picks. That this is its  method is incontestable.    As with the larvae of Capricornis and Buprestes, it is enough for the  traveller to have around it the small amount of free space necessitated  by its movements. Moist, soft, and easily compressible soil is to the  larva of the Cigale what digested wood-pulp is to the others. It is  compressed without difficulty, and so leaves a vacant space.    The difficulty is that sometimes the burrow of exit from the  waiting-place is driven through a very arid soil, which is extremely  refractory to compression so long as it retains its aridity. That the  larva, when commencing the excavation of its burrow, has already thrust  part of the detached material into a previously made gallery, now filled  up and disappeared, is probable enough, although nothing in the actual  condition of things goes to support the theory;
