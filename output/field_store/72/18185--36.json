There was not a sound to be heard;  the magic was still holding her listeners. When at last they had freed  themselves with a sigh, they pressed forward to greet her.    \"There is only one person who can play like that,\" cried the major, with  sudden inspiration--\"she is Miss Thyra Flowerdew.\"    The little girl smiled.    \"That is my name,\" she said, simply; and she slipped out of the room.    The next morning, at an early hour, the bird of passage took her flight  onward, but she was not destined to go off unobserved. Oswald Everard  saw the little figure swinging along the road, and she overtook her.    \"You little wild bird!\" he said. \"And so this was your great idea--to  have your fun out of us all, and then play to us and make us feel I  don't know how, and then to go.\"    \"You said the company wanted stirring up,\" she answered, \"and I rather  fancy I have stirred them up.\"    \"And what do you suppose you have done for me?\" he asked.    \"I hope I have proved to you that the bellows-blower and the organist  are sometimes identical,\" she answered.    But he shook his head.    \"Little wild bird,\" he said, \"you have given me a great idea, and I will  tell you what it is: _to tame you_. So good-bye for the present.\"    \"Good-bye,\" she said. \"But wild birds are not so easily tamed.\"    Then she waved her hand over her head, and went on her way singing.          KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE, by John Strange Winter      Her name was Koosje van Kampen, and she lived in Utrecht, that most  quaint of quaint cities, the Venice of the North.    All her life had been passed under the shadow of the grand old Dom Kerk;  she had played bo-peep behind the columns and arcades of the ruined,  moss-grown cloisters; had slipped up and fallen down the steps leading  to the _grachts_; had once or twice, in this very early life, been  fished out of those same slimy, stagnant waters; had wandered under the  great lindens in the Baan, and gazed curiously up at the stork's nest  in the tree by the Veterinary School; had pattered about the  hollow-sounding streets in her noisy wooden _klompen_; had danced and  laughed, had quarrelled and wept, and fought and made friends again,  to the tune of the silver chimes high up in the Dom--chimes that were  sometimes old _Nederlandsche_ hymns, sometimes Mendelssohn's melodies  and tender \"Lieder ohne Worte.\"    But that was ever so long ago, and now she had left her romping  childhood behind her, and had become a maid-servant--a very dignified  and aristocratic maid-servant indeed--with no less a sum than eight  pounds ten a year in wages.    She lived in the house of a professor, who dwelt on the Munster  Kerkhoff, one of the most aristocratic parts of that wonderfully  aristocratic city; and once or twice every week you might have seen her,  if you had been there to see, busily engaged in washing the red tile  and blue slate pathway in front of the professor's house. You would have  seen that she was very pleasant to look at, this Koosje, very comely  and clean, whether she happened to be very busy, or whether it had been  Sunday, and, with her very best gown on, she was out for a promenade in  the Baan, after duly going to service as regularly as the Sabbath dawned  in the grand old Gothic choir of the cathedral.    During the week she wore always the same costume as does every other  servant in the country: a skirt of black stuff, short enough to show a  pair of very neat-set and well-turned ankles, clad in cloth shoes and  knitted stockings that showed no wrinkles; over the skirt a bodice and  a kirtle of lilac, made with a neatly gathered frilling about her round  brown throat; above the frilling five or six rows of unpolished garnet  beads fastened by a massive clasp of gold filigree, and on her head a  spotless white cap tied with a neat bow under her chin--as neat, let me  tell you, as an Englishman's tie at a party.    But it was on Sunday that Koosje shone forth in all the glory of a black  gown and her jewellery--with great ear-rings to match the clasp of her  necklace, and a heavy chain and cross to match that again, and one or  two rings; while on her head she wore an immense cap, much too big to  put a bonnet over, though for walking she was most particular to have  gloves.    Then, indeed, she was a young person to be treated with respect, and  with respect she was undoubtedly treated. As she passed along the  quaint, resounding streets, many a head was turned to look after her;  but Koosje went on her way like the staid maiden she was, duly impressed  with the fact that she was principal servant of Professor van Dijck, the  most celebrated authority on the study of osteology in Europe. So Koosje  never heeded the looks, turned her head neither to the right nor to  the left, but went sedately on her business or pleasure, whichever it  happened to be.    It was not likely that such a treasure could remain long unnoticed and  unsought after. Servants in the Netherlands, I hear, are not so good  but that they might be better; and most people knew what a treasure  Professor van Dijck had in his Koosje. However, as the professor  conscientiously raised her wages from time to time, Koosje never thought  of leaving him.    But there is one bribe no woman can resist--the bribe that is offered  by love. As Professor van Dijck had expected and feared, that bribe ere  long was held out to Koosje, and Koosje was too weak to resist it. Not  that he wished her to do so. If the girl had a chance of settling well  and happily for life, he would be the last to dream of throwing any  obstacle in her way. He had come to be an old man himself; he lived all  alone, save for his servants, in a great, rambling house, whose huge  apartments were all set out with horrible anatomical preparations and  grisly skeletons; and, though the stately passages were paved with white  marble, and led into rooms which would easily have accommodated crowds  of guests, he went into no society save that of savants as old and  fossil-like as himself; in other words, he was an old bachelor who lived  entirely for his profession and the study of the great masters by the  interpretation of a genuine old Stradivari. Yet the old professor had a  memory; he recalled the time when he had been young who now was old--the  time when his heart was a good deal more tender, his blood a great deal  warmer, and his fancy very much more easily stirred than nowadays. There  was a dead-and-gone romance which had broken his heart, sentimentally  speaking--a romance long since crumbled into dust, which had sent him  for comfort into the study of osteology and the music of the Stradivari;  yet the memory thereof made him considerably more lenient to Koosje's  weakness than Koosje herself had ever expected to find him.    Not that she had intended to tell him at first; she was only three and  twenty, and, though Jan van der Welde was as fine a fellow as could be  seen in Utrecht, and had good wages and something put by, Koosje was by  no means inclined to rush headlong into matrimony with undue hurry.  It was more pleasant to live in the professor's good house, to have  delightful walks arm in arm with Jan under the trees in the Baan or  round the Singels, parting under the stars with many a lingering word  and promise to meet again. It was during one of those very partings that  the professor suddenly became aware, as he walked placidly home, of the  change that had come into Koosje's life.    However, Koosje told him blushingly that she did not wish to leave him  just at present; so he did not trouble himself about the matter. He  was a wise man, this old authority on osteology, and quoted oftentimes,  \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\"    So the courtship sped smoothly on, seeming for once to contradict the  truth of the old saying, \"The course of true love never did run smooth.\"  The course of their love did, of a truth, run marvellously smooth  indeed. Koosje, if a trifle coy, was pleasant and sweet; Jan as fine a  fellow as ever waited round a corner on a cold winter night. So brightly  the happy days slipped by, when suddenly a change was effected in the  professor's household which made, as a matter of course, somewhat of a  change in Koosje's life. It came about in this wise.    Koosje had been on an errand for the professor,--one that had kept her  out of doors some time,--and it happened that the night was bitterly  cold; the cold, indeed, was fearful. The air had that damp rawness  so noticeable in Dutch climate, a thick mist overhung the city, and  a drizzling rain came down with a steady persistence such as quickly  soaked through the stoutest and thickest garments. The streets were  well-nigh empty. The great thoroughfare, the Oude Gracht, was almost  deserted, and as Koosje hurried along the Meinerbroederstraat--for she  had a second commission there--she drew her great shawl more tightly  round her, muttering crossly, \"What weather! yesterday so warm, to-day  so cold. 'Tis enough to give one the fever.\"    She delivered her message, and ran on through Oude Kerkhoff as fast as  her feet could carry her, when, just as she turned the corner into the  Domplein, a fierce gust of wind, accompanied by a blinding shower of  rain, assailed her; her foot caught against something soft and heavy,  and she fell.    \"Bless us!\" she ejaculated, blankly. \"What fool has left a bundle out on  the path on such a night? Pitch dark, with half the lamps out, and rain  and mist enough to blind one.\"    She gathered herself up, rubbing elbows and knees vigorously, casting  the while dark glances at the obnoxious bundle which had caused the  disaster. Just then the wind was lulled, the lamp close at hand gave out  a steady light, which shed its rays through the fog upon Koosje and the  bundle, from which, to the girl's horror and dismay, came a faint moan.

Though  I cannot teach him the knowledge of the English, I can do much to  fit him to take his place as an Englishman, when the time comes.\"    \"It is a risky business,\" her brother said, \"but I do not say that  it cannot be carried out; at any rate, since you have so decided to  keep him, I can see no better plan.\"    Two days later, Sufder came in.    \"So you got here safely, Soyera?\"    \"Yes, I had no trouble. But I did not expect you back so soon.\"    \"The matter is all settled, though I think we were wrong to grant  any terms to the English. We had them in our power, and should have  finished the matter, straight off.\"    Delay and inactivity, the natural consequences of utter  incompetence and of divided councillors, had occurred. Colonel  Egerton, in consequence of sickness, had resigned the command; and  had been succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Cockburn. On the 9th of  January they were within eighteen miles of Poona, and they had  still three weeks' provisions with them. Two or three skirmishes  had taken place, but without any result; yet Mr. Carnac, without  having suffered any reverse, and now within a day's march of the  capital, proposed that a retreat should be made, at once.    The proposal was combated by Captain Hartley, a gallant young  officer, and Mr. Holmes of the Civil Service. Cockburn, being  called upon for his opinion, said he had no doubt the army could  penetrate to Poona; but that it would be impossible for it to  protect its enormous baggage train. Mr. Carnac, however, persisted  in his opinion, in spite of the prayers of Rugoba and, at eleven  o'clock on the night of the 11th of January, the heavy guns were  thrown into a large pool, a quantity of stores burnt, and the force  began its retreat, in face of enemies estimated differently at from  fifty to a hundred thousand men.    Against such vigilant foes there was but little hope, indeed, that  the movement would be unnoticed and, at two o'clock in the morning,  a party of horse attacked the advance guard. Cockburn sent forward  two companies of Europeans to support them, but the Mahrattas had  succeeded in plundering part of the baggage.    In a very short time the rear was also attacked. This was covered  by some six companies of Sepoys, with two guns, commanded by  Captain Hartley. These received the charge of the enemy's horse and  foot with great steadiness and, several times, took the offensive  and drove their assailants back.    When morning broke, the little force found themselves altogether  surrounded by the whole army of the Mahrattas. Hartley's Sepoys  were now sorely pressed, but still maintained their position, and  were reinforced by five companies of Europeans and two more  companies of Sepoys. With this support, Hartley beat off every  attack. At ten o'clock he received orders from Colonel Cockburn to  retreat, but the officer who carried the message returned, begging  that he would allow Captain Hartley to await a more favourable  opportunity. Cockburn agreed to this, but sent Major Frederick to  take command of the rear, with orders to retire on the main body.  This movement he effected without serious loss, and joined the rest  of the force at the village of Wurgaom.    It was already crowded with camp followers, and the wildest  confusion reigned. The enemy's horse took advantage of this and  charged through the baggage, and the troops were unable to act with  effect, being mixed up with the crowd of fugitives. However, they  soon extricated themselves, drove off the enemy, and placed the  guns in commanding positions round the village. At four o'clock the  enemy retired.    Early the next morning the Mahratta artillery opened fire on the  village. Some of the Sepoy troops now became dispirited; but  Hartley's men stood firm, and the Mahrattas did not venture to  attack. The loss on the previous day was found to amount to three  hundred and fifty-two killed, wounded, or missing; including many  who had deserted during the night. Among the killed and wounded  were fifteen European officers, whose loss was a great misfortune  for, although the Sepoys fight well under their European officers,  they lose heart altogether if not so led.    Mr. Palmer, the secretary of the committee, was now sent to  negotiate with the enemy. The first demand made was the surrender  of Rugoba; which the committee would have agreed to, but Rugoba had  privately arranged to surrender to Scindia. The next demand was  that the committee should enter on a treaty, for the surrender of  the greater part of the territory of the Bombay Government,  together with the revenue of Broach and Surat. These terms were so  hard that even the craven committee, who were entirely responsible  for the disaster, hesitated to accept them.    Cockburn was asked whether a retreat was wholly impracticable, and  he declared that it was so. Captain Hartley protested against this  opinion, and showed how a retreat could be managed. His opinion was  altogether overruled, and Mr. Holmes was sent with powers to  conclude the treaty--which, however, the committee never intended  to observe.    Scindia took the principal part in arranging the details,  superseding the authority of Nana Furnuwees, the Peishwa's  minister. Scindia's favour was purchased by a private promise to  bestow upon him the English share of Broach, besides a sum of  forty-one thousand rupees as presents to his servants.    For their share in this miserable business Mr. Carnac, Colonel  Egerton, and Colonel Cockburn were dismissed from the Company's  service; and Captain Hartley was promoted to the rank of lieutenant  colonel. The Governor of Bombay refused to ratify the treaty, on  the ground that the officials with the expedition had no power  whatever to enter into any arrangement, without the matter being  previously submitted to, and approved by, the Government.  Fortunately, at this moment a force that had been despatched from  Bengal, under Colonel Goddard, to support Rugoba was nearing the  scene of action; and that officer, learning the danger to which  Bombay was exposed, took the responsibility and, marching from  Hoosingabad, avoided a body of twenty-two thousand horse, which had  been despatched from Poona to cut him off, and reached Surat  without encountering any opposition.    This welcome reinforcement materially altered the situation, and  Bombay lay no longer at the mercy of the Mahrattas. There was now  Goddard's force, and the army that had fallen back from Poona and,  what was still more important, Scindia had by his secret convention  deserted the confederacy; and it was morally certain that neither  the Peishwa nor Holkar would send his forces against Bombay,  leaving to Scindia the power of grasping the supreme authority in  the Deccan during their absence.    In 1779 General Goddard, who was now in command at Bombay, entered  into negotiations with Nana Furnuwees. These were carried on for  some months; but were brought to a conclusion by Nana declaring  that the surrender of Salsette, and the person of Rugoba, who was  again a fugitive in Bombay, were preliminaries to any treaty.  Bombay received a reinforcement of a European regiment, a battalion  of Sepoys, and a hundred artillerymen, from Madras; but before they  arrived Goddard's force had captured Dubhoy, and a treaty had been  effected.    The town of Ahmedabad was to be handed over to our ally, Futteh  Sing; but it declined to surrender, and was taken by assault, the  storming party being commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hartley.    Scindia had as usual changed sides, and was now operating in  conjunction with Nana; and he and Holkar, with twenty thousand  horse, marched to Baroda. Goddard advanced to give battle; but  Scindia, to gain time, opened negotiations.    Goddard, however, was not to be duped. The negotiations were broken  off, and he advanced against the Mahrattas. Their horse, as usual,  charged; but were driven back by the artillery fire, and routed by  a regiment of Bengal cavalry. Scindia, however, encamped a short  distance off but, when Goddard again advanced to the attack,  retired.    Goddard, however, was not to be drawn into pursuit. He captured  some small forts, and sent Colonel Hartley to relieve Kallan, which  was being besieged by the Mahrattas. Hartley surprised their camp,  pursued them for some miles, and killed a great number; while  Lieutenant Welsh, who had been sent forward to relieve Surat--which  was threatened by a large Mahratta force--defeated these, killed  upwards of a hundred, and captured their guns; while one of  Scindia's detachments, on the banks of the Nerbuddah, was routed by  a detachment of Bengal Sepoys under Major Forbes.    On the other side of India, great successes had been gained by a  Bengal force under the command of Captain Popham; who attacked and  routed a body of plundering Mahrattas, captured by assault the  strong fort of Lahar, and not only carried by surprise the fortress  of Gwalior, regarded by the natives as impregnable, but took it  without the loss of a single man.    In December, General Goddard laid siege to Bassein. He and Hartley,  whose force was covering the siege, were attacked on the 11th of  that month by twenty thousand cavalry and infantry. These, however,  were defeated after making several desperate charges; and on the  following day another battle took place, in which the Mahrattas  were totally routed, and their general killed, after which Bassein  surrendered.        Chapter 2: A Strange Bringing Up.      The war went on during the following year, but in 1782 peace was  concluded. In 1784, the Mahrattas joined the Nizam and the British  in an alliance, having for its object the overthrow of Mysore;  which state, first under Hyder Ali, and afterwards under his son  Tippoo, was a source of danger to all the allies.
