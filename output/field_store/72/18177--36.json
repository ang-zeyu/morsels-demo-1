Here more than anywhere the  mingled melodies of birds expressed the various passions they inspired,  as if the exquisite fruits which they pecked at pleasure had given them a  double energy.    To this mountain Vathek was sometimes brought for the sake of breathing a  purer air, and especially to drink at will of the four fountains, which  were reputed in the highest degree salubrious and sacred to himself.  His  attendants were his mother, his wives, and some eunuchs, who assiduously  employed themselves in filling capacious bowls of rock crystal, and  emulously presenting them to him; but it frequently happened that his  avidity exceeded their zeal, insomuch that he would prostrate himself  upon the ground to lap up the water, of which he could never have enough.    One day, when this unhappy prince had been long lying in so debasing a  posture, a voice, hoarse but strong, thus addressed him: \"Why assumest  thou the function of a dog, O Caliph, so proud of thy dignity and power?\"    At this apostrophe he raised his head, and beheld the stranger that had  caused him so much affliction.  Inflamed with anger at the sight, he  exclaimed--    \"Accursed Giaour! what comest thou hither to do?  Is it not enough to  have transformed a prince remarkable for his agility into one of those  leather barrels which the Bedouin Arabs carry on their camels when they  traverse the deserts?  Perceivest thou not that I may perish by drinking  to excess no less than by a total abstinence?\"    \"Drink then this draught,\" said the stranger, as he presented to him a  phial of a red and yellow mixture; \"and, to satiate the thirst of thy  soul as well as of thy body, know that I am an Indian, but from a region  of India which is wholly unknown.\"    The Caliph delighted to see his desires accomplished in part, and  flattering himself with the hope of obtaining their entire fulfilment,  without a moment's hesitation swallowed the potion, and instantaneously  found his health restored, his thirst appeased, and his limbs as agile as  ever.    In the transports of his joy Vathek leaped upon the neck of the frightful  Indian, and kissed his horrid mouth and hollow cheeks as though they had  been the coral lips and the lilies and roses of his most beautiful wives;  whilst they, less terrified than jealous at the sight, dropped their  veils to hide the blush of mortification that suffused their foreheads.    Nor would the scene have closed here, had not Carathis, with all the art  of insinuation, a little repressed the raptures of her son.  Having  prevailed upon him to return to Samarah, she caused a herald to precede  him, whom she commanded to proclaim as loudly as possible: \"The wonderful  stranger hath appeared again; he hath healed the Caliph; he hath spoken!  he hath spoken!\"    Forthwith all the inhabitants of this vast city quitted their  habitations, and ran together in crowds to see the procession of Vathek  and the Indian, whom they now blessed as much as they had before  execrated, incessantly shouting: \"He hath healed our sovereign; he hath  spoken! he hath spoken!\"  Nor were these words forgotten in the public  festivals which were celebrated the same evening, to testify the general  joy; for the poets applied them as a chorus to all the songs they  composed.    The Caliph in the meanwhile caused the palaces of the senses to be again  set open; and, as he found himself prompted to visit that of taste in  preference to the rest, immediately ordered a splendid entertainment, to  which his great officers and favourite courtiers were all invited.  The  Indian, who was placed near the prince, seemed to think that as a proper  acknowledgment of so distinguished a privilege he could neither eat,  drink, nor talk too much.  The various dainties were no sooner served up  than they vanished, to the great mortification of Vathek, who piqued  himself on being the greatest eater alive, and at this time in particular  had an excellent appetite.    The rest of the company looked round at each other in amazement; but the  Indian, without appearing to observe it, quaffed large bumpers to the  health of each of them, sung in a style altogether extravagant, related  stories at which he laughed immoderately, and poured forth extemporaneous  verses, which would not have been thought bad but for the strange  grimaces with which they were uttered.  In a word, his loquacity was  equal to that of a hundred astrologers; he ate as much as a hundred  porters, and caroused in proportion.    The Caliph, notwithstanding the table had been thirty times covered,  found himself incommoded by the voraciousness of his guest, who was now  considerably declined in the prince's esteem.  Vathek, however, being  unwilling to betray the chagrin he could hardly disguise, said in a  whisper to Bababalouk, the chief of his eunuchs: \"You see how enormous  his performances in every way are; what would be the consequence should  he get at my wives?  Go! redouble your vigilance, and be sure look well  to my Circassians, who would be more to his taste than all of the rest.\"    The bird of the morning had thrice renewed his song when the hour of the  Divan sounded.  Vathek, in gratitude to his subjects, having promised to  attend, immediately rose from table and repaired thither, leaning upon  his vizir, who could scarcely support him, so disordered was the poor  prince by the wine he had drunk, and still more by the extravagant  vagaries of his boisterous guest.    The vizirs, the officers of the crown and of the law, arranged themselves  in a semicircle about their sovereign, and preserved a respectful  silence, whilst the Indian, who looked as cool as if come from a fast,  sat down without ceremony on the step of the throne, laughing in his  sleeve at the indignation with which his temerity had filled the  spectators.    The Caliph, however, whose ideas were confused and his head embarrassed,  went on administering justice at haphazard, till at length the prime  vizir, perceiving his situation, hit upon a sudden expedient to interrupt  the audience and rescue the honour of his master, to whom he said in a  whisper: \"My Lord, the Princess Carathis, who hath passed the night in  consulting the planets, informs you that they portend you evil, and the  danger is urgent.  Beware lest this stranger, whom you have so lavishly  recompensed for his magical gewgaws, should make some attempt on your  life; his liquor, which at first had the appearance of effecting your  cure, may be no more than a poison of a sudden operation.  Slight not  this surmise; ask him at least of what it was compounded, whence he  procured it, and mention the sabres which you seem to have forgotten.\"    Vathek, to whom the insolent airs of the stranger became every moment  less supportable, intimated to his vizir by a wink of acquiescence that  he would adopt his advice, and at once turning towards the Indian, said:  \"Get up and declare in full Divan of what drugs the liquor was compounded  you enjoined me to take, for it is suspected to be poison; add also the  explanation I have so earnestly desired concerning the sabres you sold  me, and thus show your gratitude for the favours heaped on you.\"    Having pronounced these words in as moderate a tone as a caliph well  could, he waited in silent expectation for an answer.  But the Indian,  still keeping his seat, began to renew his loud shouts of laughter, and  exhibit the same horrid grimaces he had shown them before, without  vouchsafing a word in reply.  Vathek, no longer able to brook such  insolence, immediately kicked him from the steps; instantly descending,  repeated his blow, and persisted with such assiduity as incited all who  were present to follow his example.  Every foot was aimed at the Indian,  and no sooner had any one given him a kick than he felt himself  constrained to reiterate the stroke.    The stranger afforded them no small entertainment; for, being both short  and plump, he collected himself into a ball, and rolled round on all  sides at the blows of his assailants, who pressed after him wherever he  turned with an eagerness beyond conception, whilst their numbers were  every moment increasing.  The ball, indeed, in passing from one apartment  to another, drew every person after it that came in its way, insomuch  that the whole palace was thrown into confusion, and resounded with a  tremendous clamour.  The women of the harem, amazed at the uproar, flew  to their blinds to discover the cause; but no sooner did they catch a  glimpse of the ball, than feeling themselves unable to refrain, they  broke from the clutches of their eunuchs, who to stop their flight  pinched them till they bled, but in vain; whilst themselves, though  trembling with terror at the escape of their charge, were as incapable of  resisting the attraction.    The Indian, after having traversed the halls, galleries, chambers,  kitchens, gardens, and stables of the palace, at last took his course  through the courts; whilst the Caliph, pursuing him closer than the rest,  bestowed as many kicks as he possibly could, yet not without receiving  now and then one, which his competitors in their eagerness designed for  the ball.    Carathis, Morakanabad, and two or three old vizirs, whose wisdom had  hitherto withstood the attraction, wishing to prevent Vathek from  exposing himself in the presence of his subjects, fell down in his way to  impede the pursuit; but he, regardless of their obstruction, leaped over  their heads, and went on as before.  They then ordered the Muezzins to  call the people to prayers, both for the sake of getting them out of the  way and of endeavouring by their petitions to avert the calamity; but  neither of these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#4)"],[1,"dressing-gown, opened his door softly, and crept along  the corridor and down the broad staircase, then along the gallery and  into the drawing-room. It was very dark, but he felt his way to a window  and undid the shutter, and there lay his city, flooded with moonlight,  just as he had imagined it.    He gazed on it for a moment in ecstasy and then turned to shut the door.  As he did so he felt a slight strange giddiness and stood a moment with  his hand to his head. He turned and went again towards the city, and  when he was close to it he gave a little cry, hastily stifled, for fear  some one should hear him and come down and send him to bed. He stood and  gazed about him bewildered and, once more, rather giddy. For the city  had, in a quick blink of light, followed by darkness, disappeared. So  had the drawing-room. So had the chair that stood close to the table. He  could see mountainous shapes raising enormous heights in the distance,  and the moonlight shone on the tops of them. But he himself seemed to be  in a vast, flat plain. There was the softness of long grass round his  feet, but there were no trees, no houses, no hedges or fences to break  the expanse of grass. It seemed darker in some parts than others. That  was all. It reminded him of the illimitable prairie of which he had read  in books of adventure.    'I suppose I'm dreaming,' said Philip, 'though I don't see how I can  have gone to sleep just while I was turning the door handle.  However----'    He stood still expecting that something would happen. In dreams  something always does happen, if it's only that the dream comes to an  end. But nothing happened now--Philip just stood there quite quietly and  felt the warm soft grass round his ankles.    Then, as his eyes became used to the darkness of the plain, he saw some  way off a very steep bridge leading up to a dark height on whose summit  the moon shone whitely. He walked towards it, and as he approached he  saw that it was less like a bridge than a sort of ladder, and that it  rose to a giddy height above him. It seemed to rest on a rock far up  against dark sky, and the inside of the rock seemed hollowed out in one  vast dark cave.    [Illustration: Beyond it he could see dim piles that looked like  churches and houses.]    And now he was close to the foot of the ladder. It had no rungs, but  narrow ledges made hold for feet and hands. Philip remembered Jack and  the Beanstalk, and looked up longingly; but the ladder was a very very  long one. On the other hand, it was the only thing that seemed to lead  anywhere, and he had had enough of standing lonely in the grassy  prairie, where he seemed to have been for a very long time indeed. So he  put his hands and feet to the ladder and began to go up. It was a very  long climb. There were three hundred and eight steps, for he counted  them. And the steps were only on one side of the ladder, so he had to  be extremely careful. On he went, up and on, on and up, till his feet  ached and his hands felt as though they would drop off for tiredness. He  could not look up far, and he dared not look down at all. There was  nothing for it but to climb and climb and climb, and at last he saw the  ground on which the ladder rested--a terrace hewn in regular lines, and,  as it seemed, hewn from the solid rock. His head was level with the  ground, now his hands, now his feet. He leaped sideways from the ladder  and threw himself face down on the ground, which was cold and smooth  like marble. There he lay, drawing deep breaths of weariness and relief.    There was a great silence all about, which rested and soothed, and  presently he rose and looked around him. He was close to an archway with  very thick pillars, and he went towards it and peeped cautiously in. It  seemed to be a great gate leading to an open space, and beyond it he  could see dim piles that looked like churches and houses. But all was  deserted; the moonlight and he had the place, whatever it was, to  themselves.    'I suppose every one's in bed,' said Philip, and stood there trembling a  little, but very curious and interested, in the black shadow of the  strange arch.          CHAPTER II    DELIVERER OR DESTROYER      Philip stood in the shadow of the dark arch and looked out. He saw  before him a great square surrounded by tall irregular buildings. In the  middle was a fountain whose waters, silver in the moonlight, rose and  fell with gentle plashing sound. A tall tree, close to the archway, cast  the shadow of its trunk across the path--a broad black bar. He listened,  listened, listened, but there was nothing to listen to, except the deep  night silence and the changing soft sound the fountain made.    His eyes, growing accustomed to the dimness, showed him that he was  under a heavy domed roof supported on large square pillars--to the right  and left stood dark doors, shut fast.    'I will explore these doors by daylight,' he said. He did not feel  exactly frightened. But he did not feel exactly brave either. But he  wished and intended to be brave, so he said, 'I will explore these  doors. At least I think I will,' he added, for one must not only be  brave but truthful.    And then suddenly he felt very sleepy. He leaned against the wall, and  presently it seemed that sitting down would be less trouble, and then  that lying down would be more truly comfortable. A bell from very very  far away sounded the hour, twelve. Philip counted up to nine, but he  missed the tenth bell-beat, and the eleventh and the twelfth as well,  because he was fast asleep cuddled up warmly in the thick quilted  dressing-gown that Helen had made him last winter. He dreamed that  everything was as it used to be before That Man came and changed  everything and took Helen away. He was in his own little bed in his own  little room in their own little house, and Helen had come to call him.  He could see the sunlight through his closed eyelids--he was keeping  them closed just for the fun of hearing her try to wake him, and  presently he would tell her he had been awake all the time, and they  would laugh together about it. And then he awoke, and he was not in his  soft bed at home but on the hard floor of a big, strange gate-house, and  it was not Helen who was shaking him and saying, 'Here--I say, wake up,  can't you,' but a tall man in a red coat; and the light that dazzled his  eyes was not from the sun at all, but from a horn lantern which the man  was holding close to his face.    'What's the matter?' said Philip sleepily.    'That's the question,' said the man in red. 'Come along to the  guard-room and give an account of yourself, you young shaver.'    He took Philip's ear gently but firmly between a very hard finger and  thumb.    'Leave go,' said Philip, 'I'm not going to run away.' And he stood up  feeling very brave.    The man shifted his hold from ear to shoulder and led Philip through one  of those doors which he had thought of exploring by daylight. It was not  daylight yet, and the room, large and bare, with an arch at each end and  narrow little windows at the sides, was lighted by horn lanterns and  tall tapers in pewter candlesticks. It seemed to Philip that the room  was full of soldiers.    Their captain, with a good deal of gold about him and a very smart black  moustache, got up from a bench.    'Look what I've caught, sir,' said the man who owned the hand on  Philip's shoulder.    'Humph,' said the captain, 'so it's really happened at last.'    [Illustration: 'Here--I say, wake up, can't you?']    'What has?' said Philip.    'Why, you have,' said the captain. 'Don't be frightened, little man.'    'I'm not frightened,' said Philip, and added politely, 'I should be so  much obliged if you'd tell me what you mean.' He added something which  he had heard people say when they asked the way to the market or the  public gardens, 'I'm quite a stranger here,' he said.    A jolly roar of laughter went up from the red-coats.    'It isn't manners to laugh at strangers,' said Philip.    'Mind your own manners,' said the captain sharply; 'in this country  little boys speak when they're spoken to. Stranger, eh? Well, we knew  that, you know!'    Philip, though he felt snubbed, yet felt grand too. Here he was in the  middle of an adventure with grown-up soldiers. He threw out his chest  and tried to look manly.    The captain sat down in a chair at the end of a long table, drew a black  book to him--a black book covered with dust--and began to rub a rusty  pen-nib on his sword, which was not rusty.    'Come now,' he said, opening the book, 'tell me how you came here. And  mind you speak the truth.'    'I _always_ speak the truth,' said Philip proudly.    All the soldiers rose and saluted him with looks of deep surprise and  respect.    'Well, nearly always,' said Philip, hot to the ears, and the soldiers  clattered stiffly down again on to the benches, laughing once more.  Philip had imagined there to be more discipline in the army.    'How did you come here?' said the captain.    'Up the great bridge staircase,' said Philip.    The captain wrote busily in the book.    'What did you come for?'    'I didn't know what else to do. There was nothing but illimitable  prairie--and so I came up.'    'You are a very bold boy,' said the captain.    'Thank you,' said Philip. 'I do _want_ to be.'    'What was your purpose in coming?'    'I didn't do it on purpose--I just happened to come.'    The captain wrote that down too. And then he and Philip and the soldiers  looked at each other in silence.    'Well?' said the boy.    'Well?' said the captain.    'I do wish,' said the boy, 'you'd tell me what you meant by my really  happening after all. And then I wish you'd tell me the way home.'    'Where do you want to get to?' asked the captain.    'The _address_,' said Philip, 'is The Grange, Ravelsham, Sussex.'    'Don't know it,' said the captain briefly, 'and anyhow you can't go back  there now. Didn't you"]]]
