[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17855"],[0,"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material (#4)"],[1," per  square inch was admitted at such a rate that the charge was heated in  one hour to 170 deg. C., which is the theoretical equivalent of 100 pounds  of steam pressure per square inch. It was found, however, that when the  temperature reached 170 deg. C. the pressure was usually 115 or 120 pounds  instead of 100 pounds, due to air and gases inclosed in the rotary. At  this point the rotary was stopped and steam and air relieved until the  pressure dropped to 100 pounds, or a solid steam pressure. The  temperature was maintained at this point for the number of hours  required to reduce the hurds, which was found to be about five, after  which the rotary was stopped and steam relieved until the pressure was  reduced to zero, when the head was removed and the stock was emptied  into a tank underneath, measuring 5-1/2 by 6 by 2 feet deep, where it  was drained and washed. Samples of waste soda solution or \"black  liquor,\" which were taken from some of the \"cooks\" for analysis, were  drawn while the stock was being thus emptied into the drainer.    _Determination of yield._--For determining the yield of cellulose fiber  the stock in the drain tank was washed with water until free from waste  soda solution, when, by means of a vacuum pump communicating with the  space between the bottom and the false perforated bottom, the water was  sucked from the stock, leaving the fiber with a very uniform moisture  content throughout its entire mass and in a condition suitable for  removing, sampling, and weighing for a yield determination. Tests have  shown that it is possible to sample and calculate the yield of bone-dry  fiber within 0.05 per cent of the actual amount.    It has been found that stocks from different materials vary greatly in  their ability to mat in the drain tank, thereby enabling a good vacuum  to be obtained, some stocks permitting a 25-inch vacuum to be obtained,  while others will not permit more than 5 inches. For this reason the  moisture content of the stock will vary from 65 to 85 per cent.    _Washing and bleaching._--Washing and bleaching were performed for the  purpose of bleaching the brown-colored cooked stock to a white product,  since it was regarded as highly probable that the fiber would be  suitable for book-paper manufacture. The colored stock was charged into  a 400-pound beating and washing engine of regular construction and  washed about one hour, the cylinder washer being covered with 60-mesh  wire cloth in order to remove fine loose dirt and chemical residues. The  washer was then raised, the stock heated by steam to about 40 deg. C., and a  solution of commercial bleaching powder was added in the quantity judged  to be necessary, after which the stock was pumped to a large wooden  tank, to remain and bleach over night. If the stock was bleached  sufficiently white it was drained and washed from bleach residues, and  if not more bleach was added until a good color was obtained. The  bleaching powder used was estimated to contain 35 per cent of available  chlorin, as this is the commercial practice, and the amount required was  calculated to the bone-dry weight of the unbleached stock. More bleach  is required for undercooked stock than for stock which is properly  cooked or overcooked; therefore, the percentage of bleach required is an  indication of the quality of the cooked stock. Since bleaching is  usually more expensive than cooking, it is desirable to cook to such a  degree that the consumption of bleach will be held within certain  limits, depending on the raw materials used and the quality of paper to  be produced. In these tests it was desirable so to cook the hurds that  the consumption of bleach would not be over about 10 per cent of the  fiber.    _Furnishing._--Furnishing is the operation of charging the beating  engine with the desired kind or kinds of fiber in the proper proportion  and amount and the adding of such loading and sizing agents as may be  necessary. As shown in the record of results, the furnish in these tests  consisted of hurd stock alone and of various proportions of hurds,  sulphite fiber, and soda fiber. The percentages to be given in the  record of the furnishes refer to the percentage of the total fiber  furnish, and this likewise applies to the loading and sizing agents. In  case sulphite or soda fiber was used, the commercial product in the dry  state was charged into the beating engine and disintegrated, after which  the hurd stock was added in the wet condition.    _Beating._--Beating is that operation concerning which the paper makers  often say \"there is where the paper is really made,\" and although the  statement may not be literally true it contains a great deal of truth.  It is the operation whereby the fibers are separated from each other,  reduced to the proper lengths, and put in such a physical or chemical  condition that they felt properly and form into a satisfactory sheet. It  is probable that the quality of the sheet depends more upon the proper  beater action than upon any other single operation. The action consists  in drawing a water suspension of the fiber between two sets of rather  blunt knives, one set being located in the bottom of a circulating  trough and the other set on the periphery of a roll revolving just above  the former set of knives. It is during this operation that the loading  and sizing agents are incorporated and the whole furnish is tinted  either to produce a satisfactory white or the desired color.    The term \"paper making,\" as used in this publication, means the  operation of forming the finished sheet of paper from stock which has  been furnished and prepared in the beater. In these tests a 30-inch  Fourdrinier machine of regular construction was used, a machine which  often is used for the production of paper for filling regular commercial  orders. The machine is designed to cause the water suspension of fibers  to flow on to a traveling wire cloth, whereby the water drains away.  More water is removed by passing the wet sheet through a series of press  rolls, after which the sheet is dried on steam-heated drums and passed  through polished iron rolls, which impart a finish to the sheet. A  Jordan refining machine was employed in conjunction with the machine to  improve further the quality of the fiber, and a pulp screen was used in  order to remove coarse and extraneous materials from the fiber.      =DESCRIPTION OF TESTS.=    The nature of each complete paper test and the dependence of each  operation on the others were such that it does not seem advisable to  submit the results of the seven tests in tabular form. The numerous  cooks, however, which furnished the pulp for the paper tests are  presented in Table I in all essential detail.

The first test consisted in making four separate cooks, Nos. 293, 294,  295, and 296, of approximately 300 pounds each, dividing the total stock  into two parts and making two separate paper tests.

See how high  she carries her head, and all upon one stem. I see myself, I see  myself!'    'I don't care a bit about all that,' said Gerda; 'it's no use telling me  such stuff.'    And then she ran to the end of the garden. The door was fastened, but  she pressed the rusty latch, and it gave way. The door sprang open, and  little Gerda ran out with bare feet into the wide world. She looked back  three times, but nobody came after her. At last she could run no  further, and she sat down on a big stone. When she looked round she saw  that the summer was over; it was quite late autumn. She would never have  known it inside the beautiful garden, where the sun always shone, and  the flowers of every season were always in bloom.    'Oh, how I have wasted my time,' said little Gerda. 'It is autumn. I  must not rest any longer,' and she got up to go on.    Oh, how weary and sore were her little feet, and everything round looked  so cold and dreary. The long willow leaves were quite yellow. The damp  mist fell off the trees like rain, one leaf dropped after another from  the trees, and only the sloe-thorn still bore its fruit; but the sloes  were sour and set one's teeth on edge. Oh, how grey and sad it looked,  out in the wide world.      FOURTH STORY    PRINCE AND PRINCESS    [Illustration: _She has read all the newspapers in the world, and  forgotten them again, so clever is she._]    Gerda was soon obliged to rest again. A big crow hopped on to the snow,  just in front of her. It had been sitting looking at her for a long time  and wagging its head. Now it said, 'Caw, caw; good-day, good-day,' as  well as it could; it meant to be kind to the little girl, and asked her  where she was going, alone in the wide world.    Gerda understood the word 'alone' and knew how much there was in it, and  she told the crow the whole story of her life and adventures, and asked  if it had seen Kay.    The crow nodded its head gravely and said, 'May be I have, may be I  have.'    'What, do you really think you have?' cried the little girl, nearly  smothering him with her kisses.    'Gently, gently!' said the crow. 'I believe it may have been Kay, but he  has forgotten you by this time, I expect, for the Princess.'    'Does he live with a Princess?' asked Gerda.    'Yes, listen,' said the crow; 'but it is so difficult to speak your  language. If you understand \"crow's language,\"[1] I can tell you about  it much better.'    'No, I have never learnt it,' said Gerda; 'but grandmother knew it, and  used to speak it. If only I had learnt it!'    'It doesn't matter,' said the crow. 'I will tell you as well as I can,  although I may do it rather badly.'    Then he told her what he had heard.    'In this kingdom where we are now,' said he, 'there lives a Princess who  is very clever. She has read all the newspapers in the world, and  forgotten them again, so clever is she. One day she was sitting on her  throne, which is not such an amusing thing to do either, they say; and  she began humming a tune, which happened to be        \"Why should I not be married, oh why?\"    \"Why not indeed?\" said she. And she made up her mind to marry, if she  could find a husband who had an answer ready when a question was put to  him. She called all the court ladies together, and when they heard what  she wanted they were delighted.    '\"I like that now,\" they said. \"I was thinking the same thing myself the  other day.\"    'Every word I say is true,' said the crow, 'for I have a tame  sweetheart who goes about the palace whenever she likes. She told me the  whole story.'    Of course his sweetheart was a crow, for 'birds of a feather flock  together,' and one crow always chooses another. The newspapers all came  out immediately with borders of hearts and the Princess's initials. They  gave notice that any young man who was handsome enough might go up to  the Palace to speak to the Princess. The one who spoke as if he were  quite at home, and spoke well, would be chosen by the Princess as her  husband. Yes, yes, you may believe me, it's as true as I sit here,' said  the crow. 'The people came crowding in; there was such running, and  crushing, but no one was fortunate enough to be chosen, either on the  first day, or on the second. They could all of them talk well enough in  the street, but when they entered the castle gates, and saw the guard in  silver uniforms, and when they went up the stairs through rows of  lackeys in gold embroidered liveries, their courage forsook them. When  they reached the brilliantly lighted reception-rooms, and stood in front  of the throne where the Princess was seated, they could think of nothing  to say, they only echoed her last words, and of course that was not what  she wanted.    'It was just as if they had all taken some kind of sleeping-powder,  which made them lethargic; they did not recover themselves until they  got out into the street again, and then they had plenty to say. There  was quite a long line of them, reaching from the town gates up to the  Palace.    'I went to see them myself,' said the crow. 'They were hungry and  thirsty, but they got nothing at the Palace, not even as much as a glass  of tepid water. Some of the wise ones had taken sandwiches with them,  but they did not share them with their neighbours; they thought if the  others went in to the Princess looking hungry, that there would be more  chance for themselves.'    'But Kay, little Kay!' asked Gerda; 'when did he come? was he amongst  the crowd?'    'Give me time, give me time! we are just coming to him. It was on the  third day that a little personage came marching cheerfully along,  without either carriage or horse. His eyes sparkled like yours, and he  had beautiful long hair, but his clothes were very shabby.'    'Oh, that was Kay!' said Gerda gleefully; 'then I have found him!' and  she clapped her hands.    'He had a little knapsack on his back!' said the crow.    'No, it must have been his sledge; he had it with him when he went  away!' said Gerda.    'It may be so,' said the crow; 'I did not look very particularly; but I  know from my sweetheart, that when he entered the Palace gates, and saw  the life-guards in their silver uniforms, and the lackeys on the stairs  in their gold-laced liveries, he was not the least bit abashed. He just  nodded to them and said, \"It must be very tiresome to stand upon the  stairs. I am going inside!\" The rooms were blazing with lights. Privy  councillors and excellencies without number were walking about barefoot  carrying golden vessels; it was enough to make you solemn! His boots  creaked fearfully too, but he wasn't a bit upset.'    'Oh, I am sure that was Kay!' said Gerda; 'I know he had a pair of new  boots, I heard them creaking in grandmother's room.'    'Yes, indeed they did creak!' said the crow. 'But nothing daunted, he  went straight up to the Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as big as a  spinning-wheel. Poor, simple boy! all the court ladies and their  attendants; the courtiers, and their gentlemen, each attended by a page,  were standing round. The nearer the door they stood, so much the greater  was their haughtiness; till the footman's boy, who always wore slippers  and stood in the doorway, was almost too proud even to be looked at.'    'It must be awful!' said little Gerda, 'and yet Kay has won the  Princess!'    'If I had not been a crow, I should have taken her myself,  notwithstanding that I am engaged. They say he spoke as well as I could  have done myself, when I speak crow-language; at least so my sweetheart  says. He was a picture of good looks and gallantry, and then, he had not  come with any idea of wooing the Princess, but simply to hear her  wisdom. He admired her just as much as she admired him!'    'Indeed it was Kay then,' said Gerda; 'he was so clever he could do  mental arithmetic up to fractions. Oh, won't you take me to the Palace?'    'It's easy enough to talk,' said the crow; 'but how are we to manage it?  I will talk to my tame sweetheart about it; she will have some advice to  give us I daresay, but I am bound to tell you that a little girl like  you will never be admitted!'    'Oh, indeed I shall,' said Gerda; 'when Kay hears that I am here, he  will come out at once to fetch me.'    'Wait here for me by the stile,' said the crow, then he wagged his head  and flew off.    The evening had darkened in before he came back. 'Caw, caw,' he said,  'she sends you greeting. And here is a little roll for you; she got it  out of the kitchen where there is bread enough, and I daresay you are  hungry! It is not possible for you to get into the Palace; you have bare  feet; the guards in silver and the lackeys in gold would never allow you  to pass. But don't cry, we shall get you in somehow; my sweetheart knows  a little back staircase which leads up to the bedroom, and she knows  where the key is kept.'    Then they went into the garden, into the great avenue where the leaves  were dropping, softly one by one; and when the Palace lights went out,  one after the other, the crow led little Gerda to the back door, which  was ajar.    Oh, how Gerda's heart beat with fear and longing! It was just as if she  was about to do something wrong, and yet she only wanted to know if this  really was little Kay. Oh, it must be him, she thought, picturing to  herself his clever eyes and his long hair. She could see his very smile  when they used to sit under the rose-trees at home. She thought he would  be very glad to see her, and to hear what a long way she had come to  find him, and to hear how sad they had all been at home when he did not  come back. Oh, it was joy mingled with fear.    They had now reached the stairs, where a little lamp was burning on a  shelf. There stood the tame sweetheart, twisting and turning her head to  look at Gerda, who made a curtsy, as grandmother had taught her.    'My betrothed has"]]]
