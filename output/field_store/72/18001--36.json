It is invariably woven in  black or dark-blue native wool with a broad variegated stripe in red  imported yarn or red _bayeta_ at each end, the designs being of  countless variety. Plates XXXIV and XXXV represent women wearing such  dresses.    [Illustration: FIG. 56.--Diagram showing formation of warp of sash.]    [Illustration: PL. XXXVII.--ZUNI WOMAN WEAVING A BELT.]    Sec. X. Their way of weaving long ribbon-like articles, such as sashes or  belts, garters, and hair-bands, which we will next consider, presents  many interesting variations from, the method pursued in making  blankets. To form, a sash the weaver proceeds as follows: She drives  into the ground four sticks and on them she winds her warp as a  continuous string (however, as the warp usually consists of threads of  three different colors it is not always _one_ continuous string) from,  below upwards in such a way as to secure two sheds, as shown in the  diagram, Fig. 56.    [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Section of Navajo belt.]    [Illustration: FIG. 58.--Wooden heald of the Zunis.]    Every turn of the warp passes over the sticks _a_, and _b_; but it is  alternate turns that pass over _c_ and _d_. When the warp is laid she  ties a string around the intersection of the sheds at _e_, so as to  keep the sheds separate while she is mounting the warp on the beams.  She then places the upper beam of the loom in the place of the stick  _b_ and the lower beam in the place of the stick _a_. Sometimes the  upper and lower beams are secured to the two side rails forming a  frame such as the warp of a blanket is wound on (Sec. IV), but more  commonly the loom is arranged in the manner shown in Plate XXXVI; that  is, the upper beam is secured to a rafter, post, or tree, while to the  lower beam is attached a loop of rope that passes under the thighs of  the weaver, and the warp is rendered tense by her weight. Next, the  upper shed is supplied with a shed-rod, and the lower shed with a set  of healds. Then the stick at _f_ (upper stick in Plate XXXVI) is put  in; this is simply a round stick, about which one loop of each thread  of the warp is thrown. (Although the warp may consist of only one  thread I must now speak of each turn as a separate thread.) Its use is  to keep the different threads in place and prevent them from crossing  and straggling; for it must be remembered that the warp in this case  is not secured at two points between three stranded cords as is the  blanket warp.    When this is all ready the insertion of the weft begins. The reed-fork  is rarely needed and the batten used is much shorter than that  employed in making blankets. Fig. 57 represents a section of a belt.  It will be seen that the center is ornamented with peculiar raised  figures; these are made by inserting a slender stick into the warp, so  as to hold up certain of the threads while the weft is passed twice or  oftener underneath them. It is practically a variety of damask or  two-ply weaving; the figures on the opposite side of the belt being  different. There is a limited variety of these figures. I think I have  seen about a dozen different kinds. The experienced weaver is so well  acquainted with the \"count\" or arrangements of the raised threads  appropriate to each pattern that she goes on inserting and withdrawing  the slender stick referred to without a moment's hesitation, making  the web at the rate of 10 or 12 inches an hour. When the web has grown  to the point at which she cannot weave it further without bringing the  unfilled warp nearer to her, she is not obliged to resort to the  clumsy method used with blankets. She merely seizes the anterior layer  of the warp and pulls it down towards her; for the warp is not  attached to the beams, but is movable on them; in other words, while  still on the loom the belt is endless. When all the warp has been  filled except about one foot, the weaving is completed; for then the  unfilled warp is cut in the center and becomes the terminal fringes of  the now finished belt.    The only marked difference that I have observed between the mechanical  appliances of the Navajo weaver and those of her Pueblo neighbor is to  be seen in the belt loom. The Zuni woman lays out her warp, not as a  continuous thread around two beams, but as several disunited threads.  She attaches one end of these to a fixed object, usually a rafter in  her dwelling, and the other to the belt she wears around her body. She  has a set of wooden healds by which she actuates the alternate threads  of the warp. Instead of using the slender stick of the Navajos to  elevate the threads of the warp in forming her figures, she lifts  these threads with her fingers. This is an easy matter with her  style of loom; but it would be a very difficult task with that of the  Navajos. Plate XXXVII represents a Zuni woman weaving a belt. The  wooden healds are shown, and again, enlarged, in Fig. 58. The Zuni  women weave all their long, narrow webs according to the same system;  but Mr. Bandelier has informed me that the Indians of the Pueblo of  Cochiti make the narrow garters and hair-bands after the manner of the  Zunis, and the broad belts after the manner of the Navajos.    [Illustration: PL. XXXVIII.--BRINGING DOWN THE BATTEN.]    [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Girl weaving (from an Aztec picture).]    Sec. XI. I will close by inviting the reader to compare Plate XXXVI and  Fig. 59. The former shows a Navajo woman weaving a belt; the latter a  girl of ancient Mexico weaving a web of some other description. The  one is from a photograph, taken from life; the other I have copied  from Tylor's \"Anthropology\" (p. 248); but it appears earlier in the  copy of Codex Vaticana in Lord Kingsborough's \"Antiquities of Mexico.\"  The way in which the warp is held down and made tense, by a rope or  band secured to the lower beam and sat upon by the weaver, is the same  in both cases. And it seems that the artist who drew the original rude  sketch, sought to represent the girl, not as working \"the cross-thread  of the woof in and out on a stick,\" but as manipulating the reed-fork  with one hand and grasping the heald-rod and shed-rod in the other.      NOTE.--The engravings were prepared while the author was in New    Mexico and could not be submitted for his inspection until the    paper was ready for the press. Some alterations were made from the    original pictures. The following are the most important to be    noted: In Plate XXXVIII the batten should appear held    horizontally, not obliquely. Fig. 5 is reduced and cannot fairly    delineate the gradations in color and regular sharp outlines of    the finely-serrated figures. Fig. 53 does not convey the fact that    the stripes are of uniform width and all the right-angles    accurately made.           *       *       *       *       *          INDEX        Blankets, Navajo 380-388      Codex, The Vatican; Illustrating Mexican weaving 391    Colors prepared for Navajo fabrics 376    Cotton woven in Pueblos, Native 375      Dyeing among Navajoes 377    Dyes used by Navajoes 377      Fabrics; Prehistoric textiles of the United States 393-425      Healds of Navajo loom 378      Mode of applying the 380, 384      Zuni 389      Looms, Navajo 377      Mathews, Dr. W., Navajo weavers 371-391      Navajo blankets, Varieties of 385-388      Mode of weaving 383      diagonal 383      diamond 384      dyeing 377      dyes 376      healds in loom used 380      looms 377      position in weaving 380      warp of blankets 378-379      sash 388      weavers 371-391      wool 375      Taylor, E.B., Anthropology cited 391      Warp, Construction of Navajo blanket 378    Warp, Construction of Navajo sash 388    Weavers, Navajo, by Dr. Washington Mathews 371-391    Weaving, Navajo position in 380      wool by Navajoes 375      Zuni, healds 389           *       *       *       *       *"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17748"],[0,"The Extermination of the American Bison (#4)"],[1,"in  1530 by Cabeza de Vaca, a half-starved, half-naked, and wholly wretched  Spaniard, almost the only surviving member of the celebrated expedition  which burned its ships behind it. In speaking of the buffalo in Texas at  the earliest periods of which we have any historical record, Professor  Allen says: \"They were also found in immense herds on the coast of  Texas, at the Bay of St. Bernard (Matagorda Bay), and on the lower part  of the Colorado (Rio Grande, according to some authorities), by La  Salle, in 1685, and thence northwards across the Colorado, Brazos, and  Trinity Rivers.\" Joutel says that when in latitude 28° 51' \"the sight  of abundance of goats and bullocks, differing in shape from ours, and  running along the coast, heightened our earnestness to be ashore.\" They  afterwards landed in St. Louis Bay (now called Matagorda Bay), where  they found buffaloes in such numbers on the Colorado River that they  called it La Rivière aux Boeufs.[15] According to Professor Allen, the  buffalo did not inhabit the coast of Texas east of the mouth of the  Brazos River.    [Note 15: The American Bisons, Living and Extinct, p. 132.]    It is a curious coincidence that the State of Texas, wherein the  earliest discoveries and observations upon the bison were made, should  also now furnish a temporary shelter for one of the last remnants of the  great herd.    MEXICO.--In regard to the existence of the bison south of the Rio  Grande, in old Mexico, there appears to be but one authority on record,  Dr. Berlandier, who at the time of his death left in MS. a work on the  mammals of Mexico. At one time this MS. was in the Smithsonian  Institution, but it is there no longer, nor is its fate even  ascertainable. It is probable that it was burned in the fire that  destroyed a portion of the Institution in 1865. Fortunately Professor  Allen obtained and published in his monograph (in French) a copy of that  portion of Dr. Berlandier's work relating to the presence of the bison  in Mexico,[16] of which the following is a translation:    [Note 16: The American Bisons, pp. 129-130.]    \"In Mexico, when the Spaniards, ever greedy for riches, pushed their  explorations to the north and northeast, it was not long before they met  with the buffalo. In 1602 the Franciscan monks who discovered Nuevo Leon  encountered in the neighborhood of Monterey numerous herds of these  quadrupeds. They were also distributed in Nouvelle Biscaye (States of  Chihuahua and Durango), and they sometimes advanced to the extreme south  of that country. In the eighteenth century they concentrated more and  more toward the north, but still remained very abundant in the  neighborhood of the province of Bexar. At the commencement of the  nineteenth century we see them recede gradually in the interior of the  country to such an extent that they became day by day scarcer and  scarcer about the settlements. Now, it is not in their periodical  migrations that we meet them near Bexar. Every year in the spring, in  April or May, they advance toward the north, to return again to the  southern regions in September and October. The exact limits of these  annual migrations are unknown; it is, however, probable that in the  north they never go beyond the banks of the Rio Bravo, at least in the  States of Cohahuila and Texas. Toward the north, not being checked by  the currents of the Missouri, they progress even as far as Michigan, and  they are found in summer in the Territories and interior States of the  United States of North America. The route which these animals follow in  their migrations occupies a width of several miles, and becomes so  marked that, besides the verdure destroyed, one would believe that the  fields had been covered with manure.    \"These migrations are not general, for certain bands do not seem to  follow the general mass of their kin, but remain stationary throughout  the whole year on the prairies covered with a rich vegetation on the  banks of the Rio de Guadelupe and the Rio Colorado of Texas, not far  from the shores of the Gulf, to the east of the colony of San Felipe,  precisely at the same spot where La Salle and his traveling companions  saw them two hundred years before. The Rev. Father Damian Mansanet saw  them also as in our days on the shores of Texas, in regions which have  since been covered with the habitations, hamlets, and villages of the  new colonists, and from whence they have disappeared since 1828.\"    [Illustration: HEAD OF BUFFALO BULL From specimen in the National Museum  Group. Reproduced from the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_, by permission of the  publishers.]    \"From the observations made on this subject we may conclude that the  buffalo inhabited the temperate zone of the New World, and that they  inhabited it at all times. In the north they never advanced beyond the  48th or 58th degree of latitude, and in the south, although they may  have reached as low as 25°, they scarcely passed beyond the 27th or  28th degree (north latitude), at least in the inhabited and known  portions of the country.\"    NEW MEXICO.--In 1542 Coronado, while on his celebrated march, met with  vast herds of buffalo on the Upper Pecos River, since which the presence  of the species in the valley of the Pecos has been well known. In  describing the journey of Espejo down the Pecos River in the year 1584,  Davis says (Spanish Conquest of New Mexico, p. 260): \"They passed down a  river they called _Rio de las Vacas_, or the River of Oxen [the river  Pecos, and the same Cow River that Vaca describes, says Professor  Allen], and was so named because of the great number of buffaloes that  fed upon its banks. They traveled down this river the distance of 120  leagues, all the way passing through great herds of buffaloes.\"    Professor Allen locates the western boundary of the buffalo in New  Mexico even as far west as the western side of Rio Grande del Norte.    UTAH.--It is well known that buffaloes, though in very small numbers,  once inhabited northeastern Utah, and that a few were killed by the  Mormon settlers prior to 1840 in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake. In the  museum at Salt Lake City I was shown a very ancient mounted head of a  buffalo bull which was said to have been killed in the Salt Lake Valley.  It is doubtful that such was really fact. There is no evidence that the  bison ever inhabited the southwestern half of Utah, and, considering the  general sterility of the Territory as a whole previous to its  development by irrigation, it is surprising that any buffalo in his  senses would ever set foot in it at all.    IDAHO.--The former range of the bison probably embraced the whole of  Idaho. Fremont states that in the spring of 1824 \"the buffalo were  spread in immense numbers over the Green River and Bear River Valleys,  and through all the country lying between the Colorado, or Green River  of the Gulf of California, and Lewis' Fork of the Columbia River, the  meridian of Fort Hall then forming the western limit of their range.\"  [In J. K. Townsend's \"Narrative of a Journey across the Rocky  Mountains,\" in 1834, he records the occurrence of herds near the Mellade  and Boise and Salmon Rivers, ten days' journey--200 miles--west of Fort  Hall.] The buffalo then remained for many years in that country, and  frequently moved down the valley of the Columbia, on both sides of the  river, as far as the Fishing Falls. Below this point they never  descended in any numbers. About 1834 or 1835 they began to diminish very  rapidly, and continued to decrease until 1838 or 1840, when, with the  country we have just described, they entirely abandoned all the waters  of the Pacific north of Lewis's Fork of the Columbia [now called Snake]  River. At that time the Flathead Indians were in the habit of finding  their buffalo on the heads of Salmon River and other streams of the  Columbia.    OREGON.--The only evidence on record of the occurrence of the bison in  Oregon is the following, from Professor Allen's memoir (p. 119):  \"Respecting its former occurrence in eastern Oregon, Prof. O. C. Marsh,  under date of New Haven, February 7, 1875, writes me as follows: 'The  most western point at which I have myself observed remains of the  buffalo was in 187 on Willow Creek, eastern Oregon, among the foot hills  of the eastern side of the Blue Mountains. This is about latitude 44°.  The bones were perfectly characteristic, although nearly decomposed.'\"    The remains must have been those of a solitary and very enterprising  straggler.    THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES (British).--At two or three points only did  the buffaloes of the British Possessions cross the Rocky Mountain  barrier toward British Columbia. One was the pass through which the  Canadian Pacific Railway now runs, 200 miles north of the international  boundary. According to Dr. Richardson, the number of buffaloes which  crossed the mountains at that point were sufficiently noticeable to  constitute a feature of the fauna on the western side of the range. It  is said that buffaloes also crossed by way of the Kootenai Pass, which  is only a few miles north of the boundary line, but the number which did  so must have been very small.    As might be expected from the character of the country, the favorite  range of the bison in British America was the northern extension of the  great pasture region lying between the Missouri River and Great Slave  Lake. The most northerly occurrence of the bison is recorded as an  observation of Franklin in 1820 at Slave Point, on the north side of  Great Slave Lake. \"A few frequent Slave Point, on the north side of the  lake, but this is the most northern situation in which they were  observed by Captain Franklin's party.\"[17]    [Note 17: Sabine, Zoological Appendix to \"Franklin's Journey,\" p. 668.]    Dr. Richardson defined the eastern boundary of the bison's range in  British America as follows: \"They do not frequent any of the districts  formed of"]]]
