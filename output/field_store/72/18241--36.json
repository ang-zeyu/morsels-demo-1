Only keep it clean, don't overcharge it, aim true, and it will  never miss the mark.\"    While the hunters crowded round Dick to congratulate him and examine the  piece, he stood with a mingled feeling of bashfulness and delight at his  unexpected good fortune.  Recovering himself suddenly he seized his old  rifle, and, dropping quietly to the outskirts of the crowd, while the  men were still busy handling and discussing the merits of the prize,  went up, unobserved, to a boy of about thirteen years of age, and  touched him on the shoulder.    \"Here, Marston, you know I often said ye should have the old rifle when  I was rich enough to get a new one.  Take it _now_, lad.  It's come to  ye sooner than either o' us expected.\"    \"Dick,\" said the boy, grasping his friend's hand warmly, \"yer true as  heart of oak.  It's good of 'ee, that's a fact.\"    \"Not a bit, boy; it costs me nothin' to give away an old gun that I've  no use for, an's worth little, but it makes me right glad to have the  chance to do it.\"    Marston had longed for a rifle ever since he could walk, but his  prospects of obtaining one were very poor indeed at that time, and it is  a question whether he did not at that moment experience as much joy in  handling the old piece as his friend felt in shouldering the prize.    A difficulty now occurred which had not before been thought of.  This  was no less than the absolute refusal of Dick Varley's canine property  to follow him.  Fan had no idea of changing masters without her consent  being asked, or her inclination being consulted.    \"You'll have to tie her up for a while, I fear,\" said the major.    \"No fear,\" answered the youth.  \"Dog natur's like human natur'!\"    Saying this he seized Crusoe by the neck, stuffed him comfortably into  the bosom of his hunting shirt, and walked rapidly away with the prize  rifle on his shoulder.    Fan had not bargained for this.  She stood irresolute, gazing now to the  right and now to the left, as the major retired in one direction and  Dick with Crusoe in another.  Suddenly Crusoe, who, although comfortable  in body, was ill at ease in spirit, gave utterance to a melancholy howl.  The mother's love instantly prevailed.  For one moment she pricked up  her ears at the sound, and then, lowering them, trotted quietly after  her new master, and followed him to his cottage on the margin of the  lake.        CHAPTER THREE.    SPECULATIVE REMARKS WITH WHICH THE READER MAY OR MAY NOT AGREE--AN OLD  WOMAN--HOPES AND WISHES COMMINGLED WITH HARD FACTS--THE DOG CRUSOE'S  EDUCATION BEGUN.    It is pleasant to look upon a serene, quiet, humble face.  On such a  face did Richard Varley look every night when he entered his mother's  cottage.  Mrs Varley was a widow, and she had followed the fortunes of  her brother, Daniel Hood, ever since the death of her husband.  Love for  her only brother induced her to forsake the peaceful village of  Maryland, and enter upon the wild life of a backwoods settlement.  Dick's mother was thin, and old, and wrinkled, but her face was stamped  with a species of beauty which _never_ fades--the beauty of a loving  look.  Ah! the brow of snow and the peach-bloom cheek may snare the  heart of man for a time, but the _loving look_ alone can forge that  adamantine chain that time, age, eternity, shall never break.    Mistake us not, reader, and bear with us if we attempt to analyse this  look which characterised Mrs Varley.  A rare diamond is worth stopping  to glance at, even when one is in a hurry!  The brightest jewel in the  human heart is worth a thought or two!  By a _loving look_, we do not  mean a look of love bestowed on a beloved object.  That is common  enough, and thankful should we be that it is so common in a world that's  over-full of hatred.  Still less do we mean that smile and look of  intense affection with which some people--good people too--greet friends  and foe alike, and by which effort to work out their _beau ideal_ of the  expression of Christian love, they do signally damage their cause, by  saddening the serious and repelling the gay.  Much less do we mean that  _perpetual_ smile of good-will which argues more of personal comfort and  self-love than anything else.  No, the loving look we speak of is as  often grave as gay.  Its character depends very much on the face through  which it beams.  And it cannot be counterfeited.  Its _ring_ defies  imitation.  Like the clouded sun of April, it can pierce through tears  of sorrow; like the noontide sun of summer, it can blaze in warm smiles;  like the northern lights of winter, it can gleam in depths of woe--but  it is always the same, modified, doubtless, and rendered more or less  patent to others, according to the natural amiability of him or her who  bestows it.  No one can put it on.  Still less can any one put it off.  Its range is universal; it embraces all mankind, though, _of course_, it  is intensified on a few favoured objects; its seat is in the depths of a  renewed heart, and its foundation lies in love to God.    Young Varley's mother lived in a cottage which was of the smallest  possible dimensions consistent with comfort.  It was made of logs, as,  indeed, were all the other cottages in the valley.  The door was in the  centre, and a passage from it to the back of the dwelling divided it  into two rooms.  One of these was subdivided by a thin partition, the  inner room being Mrs Varley's bedroom, the outer Dick's.  Daniel Hood's  dormitory was a corner of the kitchen, which apartment served also as a  parlour.    The rooms were lighted by two windows, one on each side of the door,  which gave to the house the appearance of having a nose and two eyes.  Houses of this kind have literally got a sort of _expression_ on--if we  may use the word--their countenances.  _Square_ windows give the  appearance of easy-going placidity; _longish_ ones, that of surprise.  Mrs Varley's was a surprised cottage, and this was in keeping with the  scene in which it stood, for the clear lake in front, studded with  islands, and the distant hills beyond, composed a scene so surprisingly  beautiful that it never failed to call forth an expression of astonished  admiration from every new visitor to the Mustang Valley.    \"My boy,\" exclaimed Mrs Varley, as her son entered the cottage with a  bound, \"why so hurried to-day?  Deary me! where got you the grand gun?\"    \"Won it, mother!\"    \"Won it, my son?\"    \"Ay, won it, mother.  Druve the nail _almost_, and would ha' druve it  _altogether_ had I bin more used to Joe Blunt's rifle.\"    Mrs Varley's heart beat high, and her face flushed with pride as she  gazed at her son, who laid the rifle on the table for her inspection,  while he rattled off an animated and somewhat disjointed account of the  match.    \"Deary me! now that was good; that was cliver.  But what's that scraping  at the door?\"    \"Oh! that's Fan; I forgot her.  Here! here!  Fan!  Come in, good dog,\"  he cried rising and opening the door.    Fan entered and stopped short, evidently uncomfortable.    \"My boy, what do ye with the major's dog?\"    \"Won her too, mother!\"    \"Won her, my son?\"    \"Ay, won her, and the pup too; see, here it is!\" and he plucked Crusoe  from his bosom.    Crusoe, having found his position to be one of great comfort, had fallen  into a profound slumber, and on being thus unceremoniously awakened, he  gave forth a yelp of discontent that brought Fan in a state of frantic  sympathy to his side.    \"There you are, Fan, take it to a corner and make yourself at home.  Ay,  that's right, mother, give her somethin' to eat; she's hungry, I know by  the look o' her eye.\"    \"Deary me, Dick,\" said Mrs Varley, who now proceeded to spread the  youth's mid-day meal before him, \"did ye drive the nail three times?\"    \"No, only once, and that not parfetly.  Brought 'em all down at one  shot--rifle, Fan, an' pup!\"    \"Well, well, now that was cliver; but--\" Here the old woman paused and  looked grave.    \"But what, mother?\"    \"You'll be wantin' to go off to the mountains now, I fear me, boy.\"    \"Wantin' _now_!\" exclaimed the youth earnestly; \"I'm _always_ wantin'.  I've bin wantin' ever since I could walk; but I won't go till you let  me, mother, that I won't!\"  And he struck the table with his fist so  forcibly that the platters rung again.    \"You're a good boy, Dick; but you're too young yit to ventur' among the  Red-skins.\"    \"An' yit, if I don't ventur' young, I'd better not ventur' at all.  You  know, mother dear, I don't want to leave you; but I was born to be a  hunter, and everybody in them parts is a hunter, and I can't hunt in the  kitchen you know, mother!\"    At this point the conversation was interrupted by a sound that caused  young Varley to spring up and seize his rifle, and Fan to show her teeth  and growl.    \"Hist! mother; that's like horses' hoofs,\" he whispered, opening the  door and gazing intently in the direction whence the sound came.    Louder and louder it came, until an opening in the forest showed the  advancing cavalcade to be a party of white men.  In another moment they  were in full view--a band of about thirty horsemen, clad in the leathern  costume, and armed with the long rifle of the far west.  Some wore  portions of the gaudy Indian dress which gave to them a brilliant,  dashing look.  They came on straight for the block-house, and saluted  the Varleys with a jovial cheer as they swept past at full speed.  Dick  returned the cheer with compound interest, and calling out, \"They're  trappers, mother, I'll be back in an hour,\" bounded off like a deer  through the woods, taking a short cut in order to reach the block-house  before them.  He succeeded, for, just as he arrived at the house, the  cavalcade"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],[0,"The Gorilla Hunters (#4)"],[1,"much up at the sides.    We were so filled with admiration of Jack's magnificent beard and  moustache, that Peterkin and I had resolved to cultivate ours while in  Africa; but I must say that, as I looked at Peterkin's face, the  additional hair was not at that time an improvement, and I believe that  much more could not have been said for myself.  The effect on my little  comrade was to cause the lower part of his otherwise good-looking face  to appear extremely dirty.    \"I wonder,\" said Peterkin, after a long silence, \"if we shall reach the  niggers' village in time for the hunt to-morrow.  I fear that we have  spent too much time in this wild-goose chase.\"    \"Wild-goose chase, Peterkin!\"  I exclaimed.  \"Do you call hunting the  gorilla by such a term?\"    \"_Hunting_ the gorilla? no, certainly; but _looking_ for the gorilla in  a part of the woods where no such beast was ever heard of since Adam was  a schoolboy--\"    \"Nay, Peterkin,\" interrupted Jack; \"we are getting very near to the  gorilla country, and you must make allowance for the enthusiasm of a  naturalist.\"    \"Ah! we shall see where the naturalist's enthusiasm will fly to when we  actually do come face to face with the big puggy.\"    \"Well,\" said I, apologetically, \"I won't press you to go hunting again;  I'll be content to follow.\"    \"Press me, my dear Ralph!\" exclaimed Peterkin hastily, fearing that he  had hurt my feelings; \"why, man, I do but jest with you--you are so  horridly literal.  I'm overjoyed to be pressed to go on the maddest  wild-goose chase that ever was invented.  My greatest delight would be  to go gorilla-hunting down Fleet Street, if you were so disposed.--But  to be serious, Jack, do you think we shall be in time for the  elephant-hunt to-morrow?\"    \"Ay, in capital time, if you don't knock up.\"    \"What!  _I_ knock up!  I've a good mind to knock you down for suggesting  such an egregious impossibility.\"    \"That's an impossibility anyhow, Peterkin, because I'm down already,\"  said Jack, yawning lazily and stretching out his limbs in a more  comfortable and _degage_ manner.    Peterkin seemed to ponder as he smoked his pipe for some time in  silence.    \"Ralph,\" said he, looking up suddenly, \"I don't feel a bit sleepy, and  yet I'm tired enough.\"    \"You are smoking too much, perhaps,\" I suggested.    \"It's not that,\" cried Jack; \"he has eaten too much supper.\"    \"Base insinuation!\" retorted Peterkin.    \"Then it must be the monkey.  That's it.  Roast monkey does not agree  with you.\"    \"Do you know, I shouldn't wonder if you were right; and it's a pity,  too, for we shall have to live a good deal on such fare, I believe.  However, I suppose we shall get used to it.--But I say, boys, isn't it  jolly to be out here living like savages?  I declare it seems to me like  a dream or a romance.--Just look, Ralph, at the strange wild creepers  that are festooned overhead, and the great tropical leaves behind us,  and the clear sky above, with the moon--ah! the moon; yes, that's one  comfort--the moon is unchanged.  The same moon that smiles down upon us  through a tangled mesh-work of palm-leaves and wild vines and monkeys'  tails, is peeping down the chimney-pots of London and Edinburgh and  Dublin!\"    \"Why, Peterkin, you must have studied hard in early life to be so good a  geographer.\"    \"Rather,\" observed Peterkin.    \"Yes; and look at the strange character of the tree-stems,\" said I,  unwilling to allow the subject to drop.  \"See those huge palmettoes  like--like--\"    \"Overgrown cabbages,\" suggested Peterkin; and he continued, \"Observe the  quaint originality of form in the body and limbs of that bloated old  spider that is crawling up your leg, Ralph!\"    I started involuntarily, for there is no creature of which I have a  greater abhorrence than a spider.    \"Where is it? oh!  I see,\" and the next moment I secured my prize and  placed it with loathing, but interest, in my entomological box.    At that moment a hideous roar rang through the woods, seemingly close  behind us.  We all started to our feet, and seizing our rifles, which  lay beside us ready loaded, cocked them and drew close together round  the fire.    \"This won't do, lads,\" said Jack, after a few minutes' breathless  suspense, during which the only sound we could hear was the beating of  our own hearts; \"we have allowed the fire to get too low, and we've  forgotten to adopt our friend the trader's advice, and make two fires.\"    So saying, Jack laid down his rifle, and kicking the logs with his heavy  boot, sent up such a cloud of bright sparks as must certainly have  scared the wild animal, whatever it was, away; for we heard no more of  it that night.    \"You're right, Jack,\" remarked Peterkin; \"so let us get up a blaze as  fast as we can, and I'll take the first watch, not being sleepy.  Come  along.\"    In a few minutes we cut down with our axes a sufficient quantity of dry  wood to keep two large fires going all night; we then kindled our second  fire at a few yards distant from the first, and made our camp between  them.  This precaution we took in order to scare away the wild animals  whose cries we heard occasionally during the night.  Peterkin, having  proposed to take the first watch--for we had to watch by turns all the  night through--lighted his pipe and sat down before the cheerful fire  with his back against the stem of a palm-tree, and his rifle lying close  to his hand, to be ready in case of a surprise.  There were many natives  wandering about in that neighbourhood, some of whom might be ignorant of  our having arrived at their village on a peaceful errand.  If these  should have chanced to come upon us suddenly, there was no saying what  they might do in their surprise and alarm, so it behoved us to be on our  guard.    Jack and I unrolled the light blankets that we carried strapped to our  shoulders through the day, and laying ourselves down side by side with  our feet to the fire and our heads pillowed on a soft pile of  sweet-scented grass, we addressed ourselves to sleep.  But sleep did not  come so soon as we expected.  I have often noted with some surprise and  much interest the curious phases of the phenomenon of sleep.  When I  have gone to bed excessively fatigued and expecting to fall asleep  almost at once, I have been surprised and annoyed to find that the  longer I wooed the drowsy god the longer he refused to come to me; and  at last, when I have given up the attempt in despair, he has suddenly  laid his gentle hand upon my eyes and carried me into the land of Nod.  Again, when I have been exceedingly anxious to keep awake, I have been  attacked by sleep with such irresistible energy that I have been utterly  unable to keep my eyelids open or my head erect, and have sat with my  eyes blinking like those of an owl in the sunshine, and my head nodding  like that of a Chinese mandarin.    On this our first night in the African bush, at least our first night on  a hunting expedition--we had been many nights in the woods on our  journey to that spot--on this night, I say, Jack and I could by no means  get to sleep for a very long time after we lay down, but continued to  gaze up through the leafy screen overhead at the stars, which seemed to  wink at us, I almost fancied, jocosely.  We did not speak to each other,  but purposely kept silence.  After a time, however, Jack groaned, and  said softly--    \"Ralph, are you asleep?\"    \"No,\" said I, yawning.    \"I'm quite sure that Peterkin is,\" added Jack, raising his head and  looking across the fire at the half-recumbent form of our companion.    \"Is he?\" said Peterkin in a low tone.  \"Just about as sound as a  weasel!\"    \"Jack,\" said I.    \"Well?\"    \"I can't sleep a wink.  Ye-a-ow! isn't it odd?\"    \"No more can I.  Do you know, Ralph, I've been counting the red berries  in that tree above me for half an hour, in the hope that the monotony of  the thing would send me off; but I was interrupted by a small monkey who  has been sitting up among the branches and making faces at me for full  twenty minutes.  There it is yet, I believe.  Do you see it?\"    \"No; where?\"    \"Almost above your head.\"    I gazed upward intently for a few minutes, until I thought I saw the  monkey, but it was very indistinct.  Gradually, however, it became more  defined; then to my surprise it turned out to be the head of an  elephant!  I was not only amazed but startled at this.    \"Get your rifle, Jack!\" said I, in a low whisper.    Jack made some sort of reply, but his voice sounded hollow and  indistinct.  Then I looked up again, and saw that it was the head of a  hippopotamus, not that of an elephant, which was looking down at me.  Curiously enough, I felt little or no surprise at this, and when in the  course of a few minutes I observed a pair of horns growing out of the  creature's eyes and a bushy tail standing erect on the apex of its head,  I ceased to be astonished at the sight altogether, and regarded it as  quite natural and commonplace.  The object afterwards assumed the  appearance of a lion with a crocodile's bail, and a serpent with a  monkey's head, and lastly of a gorilla, without producing in me any  other feeling than that of profound indifference.  Gradually the whole  scene vanished, and I became totally oblivious.    This state of happy unconsciousness had scarcely lasted--it seemed to  me--two minutes, when I was awakened by Peterkin laying his hand on my  shoulder and saying--    \"Now then, Ralph, it's time to rouse up.\"    \"O Peterkin,\" said I, in a tone of remonstrance, \"how could you be so  unkind as to waken me when I had just got to sleep?  Shabby fellow!\"    \"Just got to sleep, say you?  You've been snoring like an apoplectic  alderman for exactly two hours.\"    \"You don't say so!\"  I exclaimed, getting into a sitting posture.    \"Indeed you have.  I'm sorry to rouse you, but time's up, and I'm  sleepy; so rub your eyes, man, and try to look a little less like an"]]]
