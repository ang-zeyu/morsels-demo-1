[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#4)"],[1," misplacement of a single word in the  formulae, the slightest sign of resistance on the part of the victim,  any disorder among the bystanders, even the accidental squeak of a  mouse, are sufficient to vitiate the whole ritual and necessitate its  repetition from the very beginning. One of the main functions of the  Roman priesthood was to preserve intact the tradition of formulae and  ritual, and, when the magistrate offered sacrifice for the state, the  _pontifex_ stood at his side and dictated (_praeire_) the formulae which  he must use. Almost the oldest specimen of Latin which we now possess  is the song of the Salii, the priests of Mars, handed on from  generation to generation and repeated with scrupulous care, even though  the priests themselves, as Quintilian assures us, had not the least  notion what it meant. Nor was it merely the words of ceremonial which  were of vital importance: other details must be attended to with equal  exactness. Place, as we have seen, was an essential feature even in the  conception of deity, and it must have required all the personal  influence of Augustus and his entourage to reconcile the people of  Rome, with the ancient home of the goddess still before their eyes, to  the second shrine of Vesta within the limits of his palace on the  Palatine. The choice of the appropriate offering again was a matter of  the greatest moment and was dictated by a large number of  considerations. The sex of the victim must correspond to the sex of the  deity to whom it is offered, white beasts must be given to the gods of  the upper world, black victims to the deities below. Mars at his  October festival must have his horse, Iuno Caprotina her goat, and  Robigus his dog, while in the more rustic festivals such as the  Parilia, the offering would be the simpler gift of millet-cakes and  bowls of milk: in the case of the Bona Dea we have the curious  provision that if wine were used in the ceremonial, it must, as she was  in origin a pastoral deity, always be spoken of as 'milk.' The persons  who might be present in the various festivals were also rigidly  determined: men were excluded from the Matronalia on March 1, from the  Vestalia on the 9th of June, and from the night festival of the Bona  Dea: the notorious escapade of Clodius in 62 B.C. shows the scandal  raised by a breach of this rule even at the period when religious  enthusiasm was at its lowest ebb. Slaves were specifically admitted to  a share in certain festivals such as the Saturnalia and the Compitalia  (the festival of the Lares), whereas at the Matralia (the festival of  the matrons) a female slave was brought in with the express purpose of  being significantly driven away.    The general notion of the exactness of ritual will perhaps become  clearer when we come to examine some of the festivals in detail, but it  is of extreme importance for the understanding of the Roman religious  attitude, to think of it from the first as an essential part in the  expression of the relation of man to god.    =4. Directness of Relation--Functions of Priests.=--In contrast to all  this precision of ritual, which tends almost to alienate humanity from  deity, we may turn to another hardly less prominent feature of the  Roman religion--the immediateness of relation between the god and his  worshippers. Not only may the individual at any time approach the altar  of the god with his prayer or thank-offering, but in every community of  persons its religious representative is its natural head. In the  family the head of the household (_pater familias_) is also the priest  and he is responsible for conducting the religious worship of the whole  house, free and slave alike: to his wife and daughters he leaves the  ceremonial connected with the hearth (_Vesta_) and the deities of the  store-cupboard (_Penates_), and to his bailiff the sacrifice to the  powers who protect his fields (_Lares_), but the other acts of worship  at home and in the fields he conducts himself, and his sons act as his  acolytes. Once a year he meets with his neighbours at the boundaries of  their properties and celebrates the common worship over the  boundary-stones. So in[4] the larger outgrowth of the family, the  _gens_, which consisted of all persons with the same surname (_nomen_,  not _cognomen_), the gentile _sacra_ are in the hands of the more  wealthy members who are regarded as its heads; we have the curious  instance of Clodius even after his adoption into another family,  providing for the worship of the _gens Clodia_ in his own house, and we  may remember Virgil's picture of the founders of the _gentes_ of the  Potitii and the Pinarii performing the sacrifice to Hercules at the  _ara maxima_, which was the traditional privilege of their houses.  When societies (_sodalitates_) are formed for religious purposes they  elect their own _magistri_ to be their religious representatives, as we  see in the case of the Salii and the Luperci. Finally, in the great  community of the state the king is priest, and with that exactness of  parallelism of which the Roman was so fond, he--like the _pater  familias_--leaves the worship of Vesta in the hands of his 'daughters,'  the Vestal virgins. And so, when the Republic is instituted, a special  official, the _rex sacrorum_, inherits the king's ritual duties, while  the superintendence of the Vestals passes to his representative in the  matter of religious law, the _pontifex maximus_, whose official  residence is always the _regia_, Numa's palace. The state is but the  enlarged household and the head of the state is its religious  representative.    If then the approach to the gods is so direct, where, it may be asked,  in the organisation of Roman religion is there room for the priest? Two  points about the Roman priesthood are of paramount importance. In the  first place, they are not a caste apart: though there were restrictions  as to the holding of secular magistracies in combination with the  priesthood--always observed strictly in the case of the _rex sacrorum_  and with few exceptions in the case of the greater _flamines_--yet the  _pontifices_ might always take their part in public life, and no kind  of barrier existed between them and the rest of the community: Iulius  Caesar himself was _pontifex maximus_. In the second place they are not  regarded as representatives of the gods or as mediators between god and  man, but simply as administrative officials appointed for the  performance of the acts of state-worship, just as the magistrates were  for its civil and military government. In origin they were chosen to  assist the king in the multifarious duties of the state-cult--the  _flamines_ were to act as special priests of particular deities, the  most prominent among them being the three great priests of Iuppiter  (_flamen Dialis_), Mars, and Quirinus; the _pontifices_ were sometimes  delegates of the king on special occasions, but more particularly  formed his religious _consilium_, a consulting body, to give him advice  as to ritual and act as the repositories of tradition. In later times  the _flamines_ still retain their original character, the _pontifices_  and especially the _pontifex maximus_ are responsible for the whole  organisation of the state-religion and are the guardians and  interpreters of religious lore. In the state-cult then the priests play  a very important part, but their relation to the worship of the  individual was very small indeed. They had a general superintendence  over private worship and their leave would be required for the  introduction of any new domestic cult; in cases too where the private  person was in doubt as to ritual or the legitimacy of any religious  practice, he could appeal to the _pontifices_ for decision. Otherwise  the priest could never intervene in the worship of the family, except  in the case of the most solemn form of marriage (_confarreatio_),  which, as it conferred on the children the right to hold certain of the  priesthoods, was regarded itself as a ceremony of the state-religion.    In his private worship then the individual had immediate access to the  deity, and it was no doubt this absence of priestly mediation and the  consequent sense of personal responsibility, no less than its emotional  significance, which caused the greater reality and permanence of the  domestic worship as compared with the organised and official cults of  the state.    FOOTNOTES:    [3] Etruscan builders were according to tradition employed on the  earliest Roman temples.    [4] This is all open to doubt, but see De Marchi, _Il Culto Privato_,  vol. ii.          CHAPTER IV    EARLY HISTORY OF ROME--THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY      After this sketch of the main features which we must expect to find in  Roman religion, we may attempt to look a little more in detail at its  various departments, but before doing so it is necessary to form some  notion of the situation and character of the Roman community: religion  is not a little determined by men's natural surroundings and  occupations. The subject is naturally one of considerable controversy,  but certain facts of great significance for our purpose may fairly be  taken as established. The earliest settlement which can be called  'Rome' was the community of the Palatine hill, which rises out of the  valleys more abruptly than any of the other hills and was the natural  place to be selected for fortification: the outline of the walls and  sacred enclosure running outside them (_pomoerium_) may still be  traced, marking the limits of 'square Rome' (_Roma quadrata_), as the  historians called it. The Palatine community no doubt pursued their  agricultural labours over the neighbouring valleys and hills, and  gradually began to extend their settlement till it included the  Esquiline and Caelian and other lesser heights which made up the  Septimontium--the next stage of Rome's development. Meanwhile a kindred  settlement had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18571"],[0,"The Northmen, Columbus and Cabot, 985-1503 (#4)"],[1,"known. The orthography and hand  indicate that it was made later than Hauk's Book, probably in the early  part of the fifteenth century. Vigfusson considered it a better text than  the Hauk's Book version, though rougher and less carefully written.[5-2]  Other critics (Jonsson and Gering) consider 544 the safer text.    In regard to the date of composition of the archetype, it may be remarked  that both 544 and 557 speak of Bishop Brand \"the Elder,\" which  presupposes a knowledge of the second Bishop Brand, whose accession  occurred in 1263. Before this date, therefore, the originals used in  making 544 and 557 could not have been written. But this mention of  Bishop Brand \"the Elder\" does not, we think, give an adequate basis for  fixing the date of the _composition_ of the saga, as Dr. Storm believes,  who places it somewhere between 1263 and 1300, with an inclination toward  the earlier date. Dr. Finnur Jonsson,[6-1] who accepts Dr. Storm's  opinion in other respects, says on this point: \"The classic form of the  saga and its vivid and excellent tradition surely carry it back to about  1200.... To assume that the saga was first written down about 1270 or  after, I consider to be almost an impossibility.\" Nor does this  conservative opinion by Dr. Jonsson preclude the possibility, or even  probability, that written accounts of the Vinland voyages existed before  this date. John Fiske's[6-2] well-considered opinion of this same saga  (544 and 557) has weight: \"Its general accuracy in the statement and  grouping of so many remote details is proof that its statements were  controlled by an exceedingly strong and steady tradition,--altogether too  strong and steady, in my opinion, to have been maintained simply by word  of mouth.\" And Vigfusson,[6-3] in speaking of the sagas in general, says:  \"We believe that when once the first saga was written down, the others  were in quick succession committed to parchment, some still keeping their  original form through a succession of copies, others changed. The saga  time was short and transitory, as has been the case with the highest  literary periods of every nation, whether we look at the age of Pericles  in Athens, or of our own Elizabeth in England, and that which was not  written down quickly, in due time, was lost and forgotten forever.\"    The absence of contemporary record has caused some American historians  to view the narratives of the Vinland voyages as ordinary hearsay. But it  is important to remember that before the age of writing in Iceland there  was a saga-telling age, a most remarkable period of intellectual  activity, by means of which the deeds and events of the seething life of  the heroic age were carried over into the age of writing.[7-1] The  general trustworthiness of this saga-telling period has been attested in  numerous ways from foreign records. Thus Snorri Sturlason's \"The Sagas of  the Kings of Norway,\" one of the great history books of the world,  written in Iceland in the thirteenth century, was based primarily on  early tradition, brought over the sea to Iceland. Yet the exactness of  its descriptions and the reliability of its statements have been verified  in countless cases by modern Norwegian historians.[7-2]    With reference to the Vinland voyages, there is proof of an unusually  strong tradition in the fact that it has come down from two sources, the  only case of such a phenomenon among the Icelandic sagas proper. It does  not invalidate the general truth of the tradition that these two sources  clash in various matters. These disagreements are not so serious but that  fair-minded American scholars have found it \"easy to believe that the  narratives contained in the sagas are true in their general outlines and  important features.\" It lies within the province of Old Norse scholarship  to determine which of the two Vinland sagas has the better literary and  historical antecedents. After this point has been established, the  truthfulness and credibility of the selected narrative in its details  must be maintained on the internal evidence in conjunction with the  geographical and other data of early America. And here American  scholarship may legitimately speak.    These sagas have in recent years been subjected, especially by Dr. Gustav  Storm of Christiania,[8-1] to most searching textual and historical  criticism, and the result has been that the simpler narrative of Hauk's  Book and AM. 557 is pronounced the more reliable account.[8-2] In respect  to literary quality, it has the characteristics of the Icelandic sagas  proper, as distinguished from the later sagas by well-known literary men  like Snorri. Where it grazes facts of Northern history it is equally  strong. Thus, there is serious question as to the first sighting of land  by Biarni Herjulfson, who is mentioned only in the Flat Island narrative,  and nowhere else in the rich genealogical literature of Iceland, although  his alleged father was an important man, of whom there are reliable  accounts. On the other hand, the record of the \"Saga of Eric the Red,\"  giving the priority of discovery to Leif Ericson, can be collaterally  confirmed.[8-3] The whole account of Biarni seems suspicious, and the  main facts, viewed with reference to Leif's discovery, run counter to  Northern chronology and history. There are, however, two incidental  touches in the Flat Island Book narrative, which are absent from the  other saga, namely, the observation concerning the length of the day in  Vinland, and the reference to finding \"three skin-canoes, with three men  under each.\" The improbabilities of the Flat Island Book saga are easily  detected, if one uses as a guide the simpler narrative of the \"Saga of  Eric the Red,\" the only doubtful part of which is the \"uniped\" episode, a  touch of mediaeval superstition so palpable as not to be deceptive.    Aside from such things as picking grapes in the spring, sipping sweet dew  from the grass, and the presence of an apparition, the Flat Island Book  account, when read by itself, with no attempt to make it harmonize with  the statements of the \"Saga of Eric the Red\" or other facts of  Scandinavian history, is a sufficiently straightforward narrative. The  difficulty begins when it is placed in juxtaposition to these facts and  statements. It should not be and need not be discarded, but in giving an  account of the Vinland voyages it must be used with circumspection. From  an historical standpoint it must occupy a subordinate place. If Rafn in  his _Antiquitates Americanae_ had given emphatic precedence to the saga as  found in Hauk's Book and AM. 557, had left to American scholars the  Dighton Rock and the Newport Tower, and had not been so confident in the  matter of identifying the exact localities that the explorers visited, he  might have carried conviction, instead of bringing confusion, to American  scholars.    The general results of the work of the Norwegian scholar Dr. Storm,  together with a unique presentation of the original narratives, are  accessible in _The Finding of Wineland_ (London, 1890 and 1895), by an  American scholar, the late Arthur Middleton Reeves. This work contains a  lucid account of the important investigations on the subject, photographs  of all the vellum pages that give the various narratives, a printed text  accompanying these, page by page and line by line, and also translations  into English. There is one phase of the subject that this work does not  discuss: the identifications of the regions visited by the Northmen. Dr.  Storm, however, has gone into this subject, and is convinced that  Helluland, Markland, and Vinland of the sagas, are Labrador,  Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia.[10-1] The sailing directions in the \"Saga  of Eric the Red\" are given with surprising detail. These, with other  observations, seem to fit Nova Scotia remarkably well. Only one thing  appears to speak against Storm's view, and that is the _abundance_ of  grapes to which the Flat Island Book account testifies. But coupled with  this testimony are statements (to say nothing of the unreliability of  this saga in other respects) that indicate that the Icelandic narrators  had come to believe that grapes were gathered in the spring, thus  invalidating the testimony as to abundance.    Whether the savages that the sagas describe were Indians or Eskimos is a  question of some interest. John Fiske[10-2] believes that the explorers  came in contact with American Indians; Vigfusson, on the other hand,  believes that the sagas describe Eskimos. Here, however, the American has  the better right to an opinion.    On this point, it is of importance to call attention to the fact that the  Norse colonists in Greenland found no natives there, only vestiges of  them. They were at that time farther north in Greenland; the colonists  came in contact with them much later,--too late to admit of descriptions  of them in any of the classical Icelandic sagas, in which the Greenland  colonists play no inconspicuous part. Ari, the great authority on early  Norse history, speaking of the Greenland colonists, says in his  _Libellus Islandorum_:[11-1] \"They found there men's habitations both  east and west in the land [_i.e._, in both the Eastern and Western  settlements] both broken cayaks and stone-smithery, whereby it may be  seen that the same kind of folk had been there as they which inhabited  Vinland, and whom the men of Greenland [_i.e._, the explorers] called  Skrellings.\"    A sort of negative corroboration of this is offered by a work of high  rank, the famous _Speculum Regale_, written in Old Norse in Norway in the  middle of the thirteenth century. It contains much trustworthy  information on Greenland; it tells, \"with bald common sense,\" of such  characteristic things as glaciers and northern lights, discusses the  question as to whether Greenland is an island or a peninsula, tells of  exports and imports, the climate, the means of"]]]
