Self is dominant; enmity and animosity prevail. Nations and peoples are  thinking only of their worldly interests and outcomes. The clash of war  and din of strife are heard among them. But the friends of the Blessed  Perfection have no thoughts save the thoughts of heaven and the love of  God. Therefore, you must without delay employ your powers in spreading the  effulgent glow of the love of God and so order your lives that you may be  known and seen as examples of its radiance. You must deal with all in  loving-kindness in order that this precious seed entrusted to your  planting may continue to grow and bring forth its perfect fruit. The love  and mercy of God will accomplish this through you if you have love in your  own heart.    The doors of the Kingdom are opened. The lights of the Sun of Truth are  shining. The clouds of divine mercy are raining down their priceless  jewels. The zephyrs of a new and divine springtime are wafting their  fragrant breaths from the invisible world. Know ye then the value of these  days.    Awake ye to the realization of this heavenly opportunity. Strive with all  the power of your souls, your deeds, actions and words to assist the  spread of these glad tidings and the descent of this merciful bounty. You  are the reality and expression of your deeds and actions. If you abide by  the precepts and teachings of the Blessed Perfection, the heavenly world  and ancient Kingdom will be yours--eternal happiness, love and everlasting  life. The divine bounties are flowing. Each one of you has been given the  opportunity of becoming a tree yielding abundant fruits. This is the  springtime of Baha'u'llah. The verdure and foliage of spiritual growth are  appearing in great abundance in the gardens of human hearts. Know ye the  value of these passing days and vanishing nights. Strive to attain a  station of absolute love one toward another. By the absence of love,  enmity increases. By the exercise of love, love strengthens and enmities  dwindle away.    Consider me--in the years of my advanced age, burdened with physical  infirmities--crossing the wide ocean to look upon your faces. It is my hope  that through the life of the spirit you may all become as one soul, as one  tree adorning the rose garden of the Kingdom. It is my hope that the  endless treasures of the bestowals of God may be yours here and hereafter.  It is my prayer that the Supreme Concourse may be illumined by your  brilliant lights shining forever in the heavens of eternal glory.          13 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Morten  141 East Twenty-first Street, New York      Notes by Esther Foster    Praise be to God! This is a radiant gathering. The faces are brilliant  with the light of God. The hearts are attracted to the Kingdom of Baha. I  beg of God that day by day your faces may become brighter; day by day you  may draw nearer to God; day by day you may take a greater portion from the  outpourings of the Holy Spirit so that you may become encircled by the  bounties of heaven.    The spiritual world is like unto the phenomenal world. They are the exact  counterpart of each other. Whatever objects appear in this world of  existence are the outer pictures of the world of heaven. When we look upon  the phenomenal world, we perceive that it is divided into four seasons;  one is the season of spring, another the season of summer, another autumn  and then these three seasons are followed by winter. When the season of  spring appears in the arena of existence, the whole world is rejuvenated  and finds new life. The soul-refreshing breeze is wafted from every  direction; the soul-quickening bounty is everywhere; the cloud of mercy  showers down its rain, and the sun shines upon everything. Day by day we  perceive that the signs of vegetation are all about us. Wonderful flowers,  hyacinths and roses perfume the nostrils. The trees are full of leaves and  blossoms, and the blossoms are followed by fruit. The spring and summer  are followed by autumn and winter. The flowers wither and are no more; the  leaves turn gray and life has gone. Then comes another springtime; the  former springtime is renewed; again a new life stirs within everything.    The appearances of the Manifestations of God are the divine springtime.  When Christ appeared in this world, it was like the vernal bounty; the  outpouring descended; the effulgences of the Merciful encircled all  things; the human world found new life. Even the physical world partook of  it. The divine perfections were upraised; souls were trained in the school  of heaven so that all grades of human existence received life and light.  Then by degrees these fragrances of heaven were discontinued; the season  of winter came upon the world; the beauties of spring vanished; the  excellences and perfections passed away; the lights and quickening were no  longer evident; the phenomenal world and its materialities conquered  everything; the spiritualities of life were lost; the world of existence  became life unto a lifeless body; there was no trace of the spring left.    Baha'u'llah has come into this world. He has renewed that springtime. The  same fragrances are wafting; the same heat of the Sun is giving life; the  same cloud is pouring its rain, and with our own eyes we see that the  world of existence is advancing and progressing. The human world has found  new life.    I hope that each and all of you may become like unto verdant and green  trees so that through the breezes of the divine spring, the outpouring of  heaven, the heat of the Sun of Truth, you may become eternally refreshed;  that you may bear blossoms and become fruitful; that you may not be as  fruitless trees. Fruitless trees do not bring forth fruits or flowers. I  hope that all of you may become friends of the paradise of Abha, appearing  with the utmost freshness and spiritual beauty. I pray in your behalf and  beg of God confirmation and assistance.          14 April 1912  Talk at Church of the Ascension  Fifth Avenue and Tenth Street, New York      Notes by Ahmad Sohrab and Howard MacNutt    In his scriptural lesson this morning the revered doctor read a verse from  the Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, \"For now we see through a  glass, darkly; but then face to face.\"    The light of truth has heretofore been seen dimly through variegated  glasses, but now the splendors of Divinity shall be visible through the  translucent mirrors of pure hearts and spirits. The light of truth is the  divine teaching, heavenly instruction, merciful principles and spiritual  civilization. Since my arrival in this country I find that material  civilization has progressed greatly, that commerce has attained the utmost  degree of expansion; arts, agriculture and all details of material  civilization have reached the highest stage of perfection, but spiritual  civilization has been left behind. Material civilization is like unto the  lamp, while spiritual civilization is the light in that lamp. If the  material and spiritual civilization become united, then we will have the  light and the lamp together, and the outcome will be perfect. For material  civilization is like unto a beautiful body, and spiritual civilization is  like unto the spirit of life. If that wondrous spirit of life enters this  beautiful body, the body will become a channel for the distribution and  development of the perfections of humanity.    Jesus Christ came to teach the people of the world this heavenly  civilization and not material civilization. He breathed the breath of the  Holy Spirit into the body of the world and established an illumined  civilization. Among the principles of divine civilization He came to  proclaim is the Most Great Peace of mankind. Among His principles of  spiritual civilization is the oneness of the kingdom of humanity. Among  the principles of heavenly civilization He brought is the virtue of the  human world. Among the principles of celestial civilization He announced  is the improvement and betterment of human morals.    Today the world of humanity is in need of international unity and  conciliation. To establish these great fundamental principles a propelling  power is needed. It is self-evident that the unity of the human world and  the Most Great Peace cannot be accomplished through material means. They  cannot be established through political power, for the political interests  of nations are various and the policies of peoples are divergent and  conflicting. They cannot be founded through racial or patriotic power, for  these are human powers, selfish and weak. The very nature of racial  differences and patriotic prejudices prevents the realization of this  unity and agreement. Therefore, it is evidenced that the promotion of the  oneness of the kingdom of humanity, which is the essence of the teachings  of all the Manifestations of God, is impossible except through the divine  power and breaths of the Holy Spirit. Other powers are too weak and are  incapable of accomplishing this.    For man two wings are necessary. One wing is physical power and material  civilization; the other is spiritual power and divine civilization. With  one wing only, flight is impossible. Two wings are essential. Therefore,  no matter how much material civilization advances, it cannot attain to  perfection except through the uplift of spiritual civilization.    All the Prophets have come to promote divine bestowals, to found the  spiritual civilization and teach the principles of morality. Therefore, we  must strive with all our powers so that spiritual influences may gain the  victory. For material forces have attacked mankind. The world of humanity  is submerged in a sea of materialism. The rays of the Sun of Reality are  seen but dimly and darkly through opaque glasses. The penetrative power"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#4)"],[1,"musk of faithfulness from Joseph's raiment. Ye have fed on the  honey-dew of loyalty from the hands of Him Who is the one alone Beloved,  ye have feasted on immortal dishes at the bounteous banquet table of the  Lord. This plenty is a special favour bestowed by a loving God, these are  blessings and rare gifts deriving from His grace. In the Gospel He saith:  'For many are called, but few are chosen.'(2) That is, to many is it  offered, but rare is the soul who is singled out to receive the great  bestowal of guidance. 'Such is the bounty of God: to whom He will He  giveth it, and of immense bounty is God.'(3)    O ye loved ones of God! From the peoples of the world, against the Candle  of the Covenant discordant winds do beat and blow. The Nightingale of  faithfulness is beset by renegades who are even as ravens of hate. The  Dove of God's remembrance is hard pressed by mindless birds of night, and  the Gazelle that dwelleth in the meadows of God's love is being hunted  down by ravening beasts. Deadly is the peril, tormenting the pain.    The beloved of the Lord must stand fixed as the mountains, firm as  impregnable walls. Unmoved must they remain by even the direst  adversities, ungrieved by the worst of disasters. Let them cling to the  hem of Almighty God, and put their faith in the Beauty of the Most High;  let them lean on the unfailing help that cometh from the Ancient Kingdom,  and depend on the care and protection of the generous Lord. Let them at  all times refresh and restore themselves with the dews of heavenly grace,  and with the breaths of the Holy Spirit revive and renew themselves from  moment to moment. Let them rise up to serve their Lord, and do all in  their power to scatter His breathings of holiness far and wide. Let them  be a mighty fortress to defend His Faith, an impregnable citadel for the  hosts of the Ancient Beauty. Let them faithfully guard the edifice of the  Cause of God from every side; let them become the bright stars of His  luminous skies. For the hordes of darkness are assailing this Cause from  every direction, and the peoples of the earth are intent on extinguishing  this evident Light. And since all the kindreds of the world are mounting  their attack, how can our attention be diverted, even for a moment?  Assuredly be cognizant of these things, be watchful, and guard the Cause  of God.    The most vital duty, in this day, is to purify your characters, to correct  your manners, and improve your conduct. The beloved of the Merciful must  show forth such character and conduct among His creatures, that the  fragrance of their holiness may be shed upon the whole world, and may  quicken the dead, inasmuch as the purpose of the Manifestation of God and  the dawning of the limitless lights of the Invisible is to educate the  souls of men, and refine the character of every living man--so that blessed  individuals, who have freed themselves from the murk of the animal world,  shall rise up with those qualities which are the adornings of the reality  of man. The purpose is that earthlings should turn into the people of  Heaven, and those who walk in darkness should come into the light, and  those who are excluded should join the inner circle of the Kingdom, and  those who are as nothing should become intimates of the everlasting Glory.  It is that the portionless should gain their share of the boundless sea,  and the ignorant drink their fill from the living fount of knowledge; that  those who thirst for blood should forsake their savagery, and those who  are barbed of claw should turn gentle and forbearing, and those who love  war should seek instead for true conciliation; it is that the brutal,  their talons razor-sharp, should enjoy the benefits of lasting peace; that  the foul should learn that there is a realm of purity, and the tainted  find their way to the rivers of holiness.    Unless these divine bestowals be revealed from the inner self of  humankind, the bounty of the Manifestation will prove barren, and the  dazzling rays of the Sun of Truth will have no effect whatever.    Wherefore, O beloved of the Lord, strive ye with heart and soul to receive  a share of His holy attributes and take your portion of the bounties of  His sanctity--that ye may become the tokens of unity, the standards of  singleness, and seek out the meaning of oneness; that ye may, in this  garden of God, lift up your voices and sing the blissful anthems of the  spirit. Become ye as the birds who offer Him their thanks, and in the  blossoming bowers of life chant ye such melodies as will dazzle the minds  of those who know. Raise ye a banner on the highest peaks of the world, a  flag of God's favour to ripple and wave in the winds of His grace; plant  ye a tree in the field of life, amid the roses of this visible world, that  will yield a fruitage fresh and sweet.    I swear by the true Teacher that if ye will act in accord with the  admonitions of God, as revealed in His luminous Tablets, this darksome  dust will mirror forth the Kingdom of heaven, and this nether world the  realm of the All-Glorious.    O ye loved ones of the Lord! Praise be to Him, the unseen, welling  bounties of the Sun of Truth encompass you on every side, and from every  direction the portals of His mercy stand ajar. Now is the time to take  advantage of these bestowals, and benefit therefrom. Know ye the value of  this time, let not this chance escape you. Stay ye entirely clear of this  dark world's concerns, and become ye known by the attributes of those  essences that make their home in the Kingdom. Then shall ye see how  intense is the glory of the heavenly Day-Star, and how blinding bright are  the tokens of bounty coming out of the invisible realm.            3: O YE BELOVED OF GOD! O YE CHILDREN OF HIS KINGDOM! ...      O ye beloved of God! O ye children of His Kingdom! Verily, verily, the new  heaven and the new earth are come. The holy City, new Jerusalem, hath come  down from on high in the form of a maid of heaven, veiled, beauteous, and  unique, and prepared for reunion with her lovers on earth. The angelic  company of the Celestial Concourse hath joined in a call that hath run  throughout the universe, all loudly and mightily acclaiming: 'This is the  City of God and His abode, wherein shall dwell the pure and holy among His  servants. He shall live with them, for they are His people and He is their  Lord.'    He hath wiped away their tears, kindled their light, rejoiced their hearts  and enraptured their souls. Death shall no more overtake them neither  shall sorrow, weeping or tribulation afflict them. The Lord God Omnipotent  hath been enthroned in His Kingdom and hath made all things new. This is  the truth and what truth can be greater than that announced by the  Revelation of St. John the Divine?    He is Alpha and Omega. He is the One that will give unto him that is  athirst of the fountain of the water of life and bestow upon the sick the  remedy of true salvation. He whom such grace aideth is verily he that  receiveth the most glorious heritage from the Prophets of God and His holy  ones. The Lord will be his God, and he His dearly-beloved son.    Rejoice, then, O ye beloved of the Lord and His chosen ones, and ye the  children of God and His people, raise your voices to laud and magnify the  Lord, the Most High; for His light hath beamed forth, His signs have  appeared and the billows of His rising ocean have scattered on every shore  many a precious pearl.            4: PRAISE BE TO HIM WHO HATH MADE THE WORLD OF BEING, ...      Praise be to Him Who hath made the world of being, and hath fashioned all  that is, Him Who hath raised up the sincere to a station of honour(4) and  hath made the invisible world to appear on the plane of the visible--yet  still, in their drunken stupor,(5) do men wander and stray.    He hath laid down the foundations of the lofty Citadel, He hath  inaugurated the Cycle of Glory, He hath brought forth a new creation on  this day that is clearly Judgement Day--and still do the heedless stay fast  in their drunken sleep.    The Bugle(6) hath sounded, the Trumpet(7) hath been blown, the Crier hath  raised his call, and all upon the earth have swooned away--but still do the  dead, in the tombs of their bodies, sleep on.    And the second clarion(8) hath sounded, there hath followed the second  blast after the first,(9) and the dread woe hath come, and every nursing  mother hath forgot the infant at her breast(10)--yet still the people,  confused and distracted, heed it not.    And the Resurrection hath dawned, and the Hour hath struck, and the Path  hath been drawn straight, and the Balance hath been set up, and all upon  the earth have been gathered together(11)--but still the people see no sign  of the way.    The light hath shone forth, and radiance floodeth Mount Sinai, and a  gentle wind bloweth from over the gardens of the Ever-Forgiving Lord; the  sweet breaths of the spirit are passing by, and those who lay buried in  the grave are rising up--and still do the heedless slumber on in their  tombs.    The flames of hell have been made to blaze, and heaven hath been brought  nigh; the celestial gardens are in flower, and fresh pools are brimming  over, and paradise gleameth in beauty--but the unaware are still mired down  in their empty dreams.    The veil hath fallen away, the curtain is lifted, the clouds have parted,  the Lord of Lords is in plain sight--yet all hath passed the sinners by.    It is He Who hath made for you the new creation,(12) and brought on the  woe(13) that surpasseth all others, and gathered the holy together in the  realm on high. Verily in this are signs for those who have eyes to see.    And among His signs is the appearance of omens and joyous prophecies, of  hints and clues, the spreading of many and various tidings, and the  anticipations of the righteous, they who have now attained their goal.    And among His signs are His splendours,"]]]
