[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],[0,"The Story of Porcelain (#4)"],[1,"sport  came and the party pulled up-stream toward the lean-to, there were a  dozen good-sized trout in Mr. Croyden's basket and as many more in the  Doctor's.    Then came the disembarking at the upper end of the lake, and the  building of the fire. Dry wood was taken from the shelter of the  house, and in the clearing before the camp, on a foundation of large  flat stones, the fire was kindled. It was a marvel to Theo to see how  quickly Manuel and Tony made things ready. They produced a small  frying-pan, greased it, and had the fish sizzling in it before you  could say Jack Robinson. Then they unpacked the hampers and brought  forth tin plates, knives, and forks.    How good the meal tasted!    The great slices of bread-and-butter, with layers of creamy cheese  between them, seemed a royal feast to the ravenous sportsmen; and the  steaming coffee and thin slices of crisp bacon food for the gods. As  for the trout--particularly the big one Theo himself had caught--well,  there never was such eating!    After lunch was done the fishermen were loth to leave the sunny  shelter of the cabin.    Dr. Swift and Mr. Croyden lounged on the door-sill, while Theo skipped  stones in the water until his arm was tired. Then exhausted by his  exertions he sank wearily down on a stump near the lean-to and  remarked:    \"Why wouldn't this be a good time, Mr. Croyden, to tell us some more  about Greek pottery?\"    \"Greek pottery? Bless my heart! I thought you had forgotten all about  that.\"    \"So I had when I was fishing,\" confessed Theo honestly. \"But I have  remembered it again now.\"    \"You are a frank youngster,\" laughed Mr. Croyden. \"Well, let me  see. You know the making of pottery was a fine art among the  Greeks. They made two kinds--neither of them glazed, of course,  because at that time nobody knew how to glaze pottery. The first kind  was a pottery of red clay on which were placed decorations of black  pigment; the other was a pottery on which they painted figures in red,  afterward filling in the background around them with black. These two  varieties of ware are briefly known as black on red, and red on  black. The black portion of this pottery possessed a wonderful polish  which came from the black pigment mixed with the clay; the red part,  on the contrary, had no lustre, evidently being smoothed and polished  with some hard tool after the vase was finished. These vases were  very beautiful in form and design, no two of them being alike. Each  was made by an individual artist who pleased himself as to the  arrangement of the birds, animals, and gracefully draped figures  with which he decorated it. The famous Francois vase at Florence is a  marvelous example of this sixth century workmanship; every inch of its  closely adorned surface is covered with carefully drawn figures in  black, white, and purple. This particular piece was probably made by  two Athenian artists, as it shows two distinct types of work. Think  how fortunate we are to have had it come down to us unbroken through  the tumult of the years!\"    Mr. Croyden gazed thoughtfully into the fire.    \"You know that at the time these exquisite vases were made the entire  Greek nation was devoting itself to the fashioning of beautiful  things. Sculptors were carving wonderful statues, toiling eagerly to  make each piece more perfect in form; architects were rearing such  buildings as the world has never since seen; and in the centre of  Athens a district was reserved which was entirely occupied by the  shops of potters and painters and known as the _ceramicus_. It is from  this ancient word that our present day term ceramics is  derived. Within this area devoted to the making of pottery the artists  worked, each one reverently bending his energy to give to the world a  thing which should be as nearly perfect in form and decoration as he  could make it. Thousands of vases went out, many of them into the  homes of rich, beauty-loving Greeks; many into the temples; and many  into Athenian tombs; for the people of this nation always loyally  honored their dead. In addition to these vases there were smaller  articles--perfume bottles, jars for wine or water, utensils used at  ceremonials in the temples; and the beautiful amphora, a vase given as  a prize at the great Greek festivals, and the progenitor of the silver  cups we now give the winners in athletic games. This latter type of  vase had two handles and frequently its base was tapered to a point in  order that it might rest in a tripod, or be thrust into the earth. At  the Louvre in Paris there is a very famous Greek amphora which I hope  you will see some day.\"    \"I should like to see it,\" declared Theo eagerly.    \"I intend you shall, son,\" put in Dr. Swift. \"I mean to give you the  chance to see all the finest things in the world, if I have my way.\"    Theo smiled gratefully into his father's face.    \"When we marvel at the grace and perfection of Greek decoration we  must bear in mind that as a spur to their artistic sense the people  had beauty constantly before them. Theirs was a country of smiling  skies, of blue heaven and golden sunshine; their buildings breathed  the very essence of all that is highest in art; even the throngs that  filled the streets were picturesque and classic in appearance. For in  those days fashions of dress did not change as capriciously as they do  now. A beautiful style of costume was adopted and retained, and in  consequence artists had ever before them men and women who were  excellent models for chaste decoration. In our time such a procedure  would be impossible, as the national dress of both our men and women  has become utilitarian rather than beautiful, and now has little  artistic to recommend it. If we wish classic draperies and faultless  styles of hair-dressing we must revert to the past for our models.\"    There was a silence broken only by the snapping of the fire.    \"To give you some idea how much of this pottery the Greeks turned out  I must tell you that at Naples there is a collection of two thousand  Greek cups and vases. The Vatican at Rome has one thousand more;  Florence has seven hundred; Turin five hundred; Vienna three hundred;  Berlin about seventeen hundred; the Louvre at Paris fifteen hundred;  and the British Museum nearly twenty-six hundred. Besides these there  are some twenty thousand more scattered all over the world in private  collections.\"    A whistle of surprise escaped Theo.    \"Not all of these are equally good, however,\" went on  Mr. Croyden. \"The Etruscan work done by wandering Greek potters and by  some persons rated as identical with the Roman Samian ware, is one of  the finest varieties remaining to us; probably because it escaped  being buried with the dead and therefore was not injured or discolored  by the soil as were so many of the Greek vases found at  Athens. Moreover, we must remember that not every artist who made and  decorated an object excelled. Naturally some did more perfect work  than others, even in the days of the best Grecian art. How sad it is  that at a later period in history the work of the Greeks became less  fine because the ideals of the race degenerated. Pottery makers,  sculptors, and builders began to produce cheap, gaudy things which  were lavishly decorated, and reflected the luxury and extravagance  that had crept into the nation. From that moment the glory of Greece  decayed. For it is the ideals of a country and its people that serve  as guide-posts to the greatest and finest deeds. Unless each  individual in a land aims at the purest and best his country will  never reach holiness. It is the struggle for perfection in every field  of life that results in fine art, fine men, and fine nations.\"    Mr. Croyden had become very grave.    Then he rose abruptly, took out his pipe, and knocked the bowl of it  upon a stump.    \"Well, well,\" he exclaimed with a swift return to his accustomed  gaiety, \"I think I have lectured long enough. See! Manuel has  everything packed up and is waiting for us. Suppose we start back  home.\"    But Theo was very quiet on the trip back to the camp.    He was thinking about the Greeks.          [Illustration]          CHAPTER III    THEO MEETS WITH A CALAMITY      It was when Theo had been three days in camp that the accident  happened.    Outside the cook-house stood a ladder to be used in case of fire, and  as one morning the boy passed it, it suddenly came to him what fun it  would be to mount to the ridge-pole of the cabin and toss a handful of  tiny pebbles down on the heads of the guides as they passed through  the door beneath. What a surprise it would be to Tony and Franz to  have the stones come clattering down upon them; and what sport it  would be to watch them as they tried to solve the riddle as to where  the missiles came from!    It was a foolish scheme, and probably had Theo thought it over a  second time he would have abandoned it; but he was an impulsive boy  who often acted before he carefully considered what he was  doing. Therefore without a moment's hesitation he cautiously dragged  the ladder to the end of the cabin and, making sure that no one was  looking, began climbing it. He was on the top rung and was just  stepping softly to the roof when there was a snapping of rotten wood  and the bar beneath his foot gave way, sending him crashing headlong  to the ground.    Fortunately for Theo the cabin was a low one, and he had not far to  fall; but in trying to save himself he twisted one leg beneath him,  and the result was most disastrous. He felt a sudden sharp pain as he  struck the earth, and when a second later he attempted to rise he  discovered to his chagrin that it was impossible for him to do  so. Every movement he made hurt him excruciatingly, and presently  feeling both faint and dizzy he abandoned further effort.    For an interval he lay very still, ashamed to call for help; then  pocketing his pride he began to yell"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19424"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Exeter (#4)"],[1,"pecuniary mulcts, and by bodily  chastisment, as they deserved.\" But the queen caused his body to be  rescued from the \"hepe of rubische,\" and it was removed to Exeter, where  it lies on the north side of the choir. He left behind him large sums of  money and plate, a valuable library and, unique item, ninety-one rings.  He was certainly one of the greatest prelates in English history, and  though he may have been, as his detractors asserted, \"fumische and  without pite,\" he was revered in his diocese, and left an example of  courage and honesty to succeeding generations. His executors, animated  by a wish to do what he would have desired, distributed L210 8s. 8d. in  charities, and gave considerable sums to other worthy objects. And the  Abbot of Hartland caused the 15th of October to be solemnly observed,  out of gratitude for the late bishop's bounty, and decreed that on that  day \"for all future times 'XIII. pauperes in aula abbatis, pro ipsius  anima, pascantur.'\"    To follow so redoubtable a prelate as Stapledon must have been an  extremely difficult task. But Grandisson, who was appointed after  Berkeley's short episcopate ended, has sometimes been called the most  magnificent prelate who ever filled the see. He was nominated directly  by the pope, and consecrated by his holiness at Avignon. His chief glory  is that he allowed the splendour of the see in no wise to diminish, and  he kept up the Stapledon traditions of princely hospitality and  well-doing. His reputation of \"grave, wise, and politick\" seems to have  been fairly earned. As a descendant of the great ducal house of  Burgundy, he had lived much with princes and held the position of nuncio  \"at the courts of all the mightiest princes of Christendom.\" His  election was carried out in direct opposition to the wishes of the  canons of Exeter, but a wise choice had been made, and by his long  episcopate of forty years he gained honour for himself and good fortune  for his people. He had to face many difficulties at first that might  well have appalled a weaker man. The tragic death of Stapledon had  terrified all men, the great work of that giant intellect remained  unfinished, and required some one of exceptional energy to complete it  fitly. Added to these difficulties, the episcopal manors had been  plundered and the accounts were terribly muddled. Grandisson, luckily,  was a man who looked upon difficulties as things to be overcome. He  applied to the members of his family for funds, and the negotiations are  to his family and subsequently to the diocese at large for funds. The  negotiations are interesting, for the borrower is the only person who  maintained his dignity unimpaired. With courteous pertinacity and a  fitting show of anger, he got the supplies he needed. With indomitable  energy he managed to arrange in perfect order the confused affairs of  his diocese. Turning eagerly to the task of completing the building of  his church, he transformed the six west bays of the nave, vaulting,  aisles, west window, and north cloister. In spiritual and temporal  affairs he was equally busy. Twice at least he was the host of royalty,  once the Black Prince visited his diocese with the captive king of  France. The same illustrious warrior, shortly before his death, again  enjoyed the bishop's hospitality.    In 1343 Grandisson was sent as ambassador to Rome, and the sound sense  he had shown at Exeter was equally apparent in the conduct of his  mission, so that it was written of him that \"he did his message with  much wisdom and honour.\" Certainly, few bishops have had so exalted a  view of the dignity and importance of the episcopal office, and none  ever dared to fight more boldly for his imagined rights. When the  Archbishop Mepham determined to make a personal visitation, Grandisson's  anger was kindled. Gathering round him a body of armed retainers, he met  the archbishop at the north-west gate of the close. There might have  been a bloody conflict, for neither prelate was likely to give way.  Fortunately, sober counsels prevailed, and the quarrel was referred to  the pope. His holiness decided in Grandisson's favour, and \"the dispute  did half break Mepham's heart, and the Pope, siding with the Bishop of  Exeter, did break the other half.\" So writes Fuller, and the quaint  sentence does not lack authority, for the archbishop died shortly after  the termination of the quarrel.    Grandisson remembered his cathedral in his will. He bequeathed to his  successors his crozier and mitre, and to the diocese 2,000 marks. At his  funeral, in accordance with his instructions, a hundred poor persons  were clothed and money was distributed among the prisoners and the sick.  He remembered, too, the needs of the poorer clergy and the hospitals,  while to Pope Urban and Edward III. he left splendid legacies. His  funeral, as his life, was simple and economical. For his magnificent  presents, his gorgeous works on the structure of his church, were made  possible by his own simple, almost parsimonious manner of living. He was  buried in the chapel of St. Radegunde, but the tomb was destroyed in  Elizabeth's time, and his ashes lie \"no man knows where.\"    Brantyngham, the next bishop, completed the cloisters, the east window  and west front. But, as Canon Freeman has said, \"the rest of the works  of this and the following century are little else than petty  restorations; of course in a later and inferior style, and generally to  the detriment of the building.\" But there is still much in the history  of the church and the see that deserves a passing notice. Under  Brantyngham, the old feud that Grandisson had finished so satisfactorily  to himself, began again. But the victory this time was with the  archbishop. At Topsham, a village not far from the city, the bishop's  servants attacked savagely the archbishop's mandatory. Full of zeal for  the honour, as they conceived it, of their own prelate, they made the  wretched creature eat the archbishop's writ and seal. But the meal of  parchment and wax did not by any means settle the dispute. The bishop's  cause, indeed, was irretrievably damaged, the king was furious, an  appeal to the pope was unsuccessful, and Brantyngham had to make full  submission to the offended primate. Henceforth the archbishop's right of  visitation was not opposed. Had another than Grandisson been bishop in  Mepham's day the dispute would never, probably, have arisen; for the  archbishop was undoubtedly only exercising his rights, such visitations  being according to canon, and of ancient usage.    The next bishop whose episcopate is important is Lacy, who glazed the  nave windows and raised the chapter house. He has, too, an unique claim  on our regard because of his saintly character. As yet no saint had made  the cathedral venerable, and the sentimental affection and profit which  saintly relics were wont to cause was still lacking. It is said that  Iscanus had contrived to get some relics of Becket for his cathedral,  but there was no local saint, and this want Lacy supplied. Yet the days  of his episcopacy were by no means absolutely calm. At the very moment  of his accession he involved himself in a dispute with the city  corporation as to the liberties of his cathedral. Nor was he, though  meek and holy, at all inclined to submit to any infringement of his  prerogatives, even when the transgressor happened to wear a crown.  Indeed, he most successfully protested against the conduct of Henry VI.,  who held a jail delivery in the bishop's hall. Two men were condemned to  death, but the bishop remonstrated so forcibly against this exercise of  temporal authority within the precincts of the sanctuary, that they were  released. As an author Lacy gained a considerable reputation. His \"Liber  Pontificalis\" is still preserved, his office in honour of Raphael the  Archangel was admired and used in many cathedrals and churches. When he  died miracles were performed at his tomb, and pilgrimages were  constantly made to it by the common people.    [Illustration: THE CHAPTER HOUSE (FROM BRITTON'S 'EXETER', 1826).]    From this time onward the architectural history of the cathedral becomes  less important. Its great periods may thus be summed up, 1107 to 1206  Warelwast and Marshall built the Norman church; 1257 to 1280 Bronscombe  and Quivil began the Decorated work; 1292 to 1308 Bytton and Stapledon  completed the eastern part; 1327 to 1369 Grandisson and Brantyngham  completed the nave, west front, and cloister. The fifth and last change  is the introduction of Perpendicular work, chiefly noticeable in the  chapter house, the west screen, and the great east window. The day of  the great builders was waning fast. The old faith that inspired them was  dwindling, the attraction of national concerns was too great for local  effort. Moreover, the desire to make intricately beautiful, right enough  in itself, had vitiated, as it was bound to do, the taste of architect  and builder. The old Norman cathedrals, however rugged, were imposing in  their stern and simple strength. The desire for decoration affected  various transformations, which at first left the building more beautiful  and not less strong. But gradually the simplicity and strength disappear  altogether. Luckily, as we shall see, the great church of St. Mary and  St. Peter has suffered less than most buildings that have undergone so  many changes. \"As it is, the church of Exeter is a remarkable case of  one general design being carried out through more than a hundred years.\"  The church is Quivil's design, and the variations, though important, do  not seriously detract from it.    The events of the next five hundred years belong more to the history of  the see, and even of England, than to the church. In the election of  George Neville (1458) we notice the immense value put on noble birth.  Only one other reason can be alleged as weighing with those responsible  for the choice."]]]
