Formerly \"strings\" of oxen or Percheron horses were used, but  they are now largely superseded by some form of donkey engine, Fig.  26. These are placed at the center of a \"yard.\"    Yarding is the skidding of logs to the railway or water way by means  of these donkey engines. Attached to the donkey engine are two drums,  one for the direct cable, three-fourths to one inch in diameter and  often half a mile long, to haul in the logs, the other for the smaller  return cable, twice as long as the direct cable and used to haul back  the direct cable. At the upper end of the skidway, when the logs are  ready to be taken to the railway or boomed, they are fastened together,  end to end, in \"turns\" of four or more. The direct cable is attached  to the front of the \"turn\", and the return cable to the rear end. By  winding the direct cable on its drum, the \"turn\" is hauled in. The  return cable is used to haul back the end of the direct cable, and  also, in case of a jam, to pull back and straighten out the turn.  Instead of a return cable a horse is often used to haul out the direct  cable. Signaling from the upper end of the skidway to the engineer is  done by a wire connected to the donkey's whistle, by an electric bell,  or by telephone.    Sometimes these donkey engines are in relays, one engine hauling a  turn of logs to within reach of the next one, which passes it on to  the next until the siding is reached.    [Illustration: Fig. 27. Steam Skidder at Work. Grant County,  Arkansas.]    Where there are steep canons to be crossed, a wire trolley may be  stretched and the great logs carried over suspended from it.    In the South a complicated machine called a steam skidder, Fig. 27,  equipped with drums, booms, etc., is much used both for skidding in  the logs and then for loading them on the cars. It is itself mounted  on a flat car.    An improvement on this is the locomotive boom derrick which is widely  used both on the Pacific coast and of late in the Lake Superior  region. It is a combined locomotive, skidder and loader. Its most  unique feature is that it can be lifted off the track so as to allow  flat cars to run underneath it. This feat is accomplished thus: A  device, which is something like that used in elevating the bodies of  coal wagons, lifts the engine several feet above the rails. Then steel  legs, which are curved outwardly, are lowered until the shoes which  are attached to them rest on the outward end of the railroad ties. The  truck of the locomotive is then folded up under it out of the way and  cars can run under it, the curved legs giving plenty of clearance.  The derrick attached is of the breast type, the two legs being firmly  fastened. When anchored the engine can be used either for skidding or  loading. For skidding, there are two cables, one being run out while  the other is being wound on its drum.    [Illustration: Fig. 28. Log Train, Humboldt County, California.]    In loading, the machine is located so that the empty car will be  directly in front of it, and then the logs are lifted up and placed on  the car by the derrick. When the car is loaded the machine can either  move on to the next car, or pull it under itself into place. With the  help of four men it can load from 125,000 to 150,000 feet of timber  in a day. By means of the cable it can make up a train, and then  by lowering the truck and raising the legs out of the way, it is  converted into a locomotive and hauls the train away to the mill or  railway station at the rate of three or four miles at hour.    As forests are cut away along the water courses, railways have to be  resorted to more and more, Fig. 28. This has had a stimulative effect  on the logging business, for now the logger is independent of the  snow. On account of the steep grades and sharp curves often necessary  in logging railways, a geared locomotive is sometimes used, Fig. 29.  It can haul a train of twenty loaded cars up a twelve per cent grade.  The geared engine has also been used as a substitute for cable power,  in \"yarding\" operations. The \"turns\" of logs are drawn over the ground  between the rails, being fastened to the rear of the engine by hook  and cable. This has proved to be a very economical use of power and  plant.    [Illustration: Fig. 29. Donkey Engine Yarding.]    [Illustration: Fig. 30. Giant Raft. In the background is a completed  raft; in the foreground a cradle in which a raft is being built.]    Another method of traction where the woodland is open enough is with  a traction engine. The ones employed have sixty to one hundred horse  power. The great logs may be placed on wood rollers, as a house is  when moved, or the logs may be hauled in on a low truck with broad  wheels. The \"tractor\" hauls the log direct to the railway if the  distance is not too great.    [Illustration: Fig. 31. Snow Locomotive. Takes the place of 12  teamsters and 12 horses. Minnesota.]    In Northern Michigan a \"snow locomotive,\" Fig. 31, is coming into  use, which has tremendous tractive power, hauling one hundred to one  hundred fifty tons of lumber over snow or ice. It moves on runners,  but there is between them a large cylinder armed with teeth. This  cylinder can be raised or lowered by the operator as it moves over the  surface of the ground. The teeth catch in the snow or ice, and since  the cylinder is heated by the exhaust steam, it melts and packs the  snow for the trucks following it. The drum is six feet in diameter,  with walls an inch and a half thick, and it weighs seven tons. It is  used in all sorts of places where horses cannot go, as in swamps, and  by substituting wheels for runners it has even been used on sand.    In the Canadian lakes there has been devised a queer creature called  an \"alligator,\" a small and heavily equipped vessel for hauling the  logs thru the lakes. When its operations in one lake are finished, a  wire cable is taken ashore and made fast to some tree or other safe  anchorage, the capstan on its forward deck is revolved by steam and  the \"alligator\" hauls itself out of the water across lots to the next  lake and begins work there.    The greatest improvement in water transportation is the giant raft,  Fig. 30. When such a raft is made up, logs of uniform length are  placed together, the width of the raft being from sixty to one hundred  feet and its length, one thousand feet or more. It may contain a  million board feet of timber. The different sections are placed end to  end, and long boom sticks, i. e., logs sixty to seventy feet long,  are placed around them to bind the different sections together, and  finally the whole mass is heavily chained. Such a raft has been towed  across the Pacific.      LOGGING.    REFERENCES[*]:      River Lumbering.      Pinchot, _Primer_, II, pp. 40-53.

SAWMILLING.      The principal saws in a mill are of three kinds, the circular, Fig.  32, the gang, Fig. 33, and the band, Fig. 34. The circular-saw, tho  very rapid, is the most wasteful because of the wide kerf, and of  course the larger the saw the thicker it is and the wider the kerf.  The waste in sawdust is about one-fifth of the log. In order to lessen  this amount two smaller saws, one hung directly above the other, have  been used. One saws the lower half of the log and the other the upper  half. In this way, it is possible to cut very large logs with the  circular-saw and with less waste. The circular-saw is not a perfectly  flat disc, but when at rest is slightly convex on one side and concave  on the other. This fullness can be pushed back and forth as can the  bottom of an oil-can. When moving at a high rate of speed, however,  the saw flattens itself by centrifugal force. This enables it to cut  straight with great accuracy.    [Illustration: Fig. 32. Double Circular-Saw and Carriage.]    A gang-saw is simply a series of straight saw-blades set in a vertical  frame. This has a reciprocating motion, enabling it to cut a log into  a number of boards at one time. It has this drawback, that it must  cut the size of lumber for which it is set; that is, the sawyer has  no choice in cutting the thickness, but it is very economical, wasting  only one-eighth of the log in sawdust. A special form is the flooring  gang. It consists of a number of saws placed one inch apart. Thick  planks are run thru it to saw up flooring.    [Illustration: Fig. 33. Gang-Saw.]    [Illustration: Fig. 34. Band-Saw.]    The band-saw is fast displacing the other two, wherever it can be  used. It cuts with great rapidity and the kerf is narrow. When first  used it could not be depended upon to cut straight, but by utilizing  the same principle that is used in the circular-saw, of putting the  cutting edge under great tension by making it slightly shorter than  the middle of the saw, it now cuts with great accuracy. Band-saws are  now made up to 12 inches wide, 50 feet long, and run at the rate of  10,000 feet a minute. They are even made with the cutting teeth on  both edges, so that the log can be sawed both going and coming.

And again, when thinking  of the India of to-day, they remember chiefly the India of Calcutta,  Bombay, or Madras, the India of the towns. I look to the India of the  village communities, the true India of the Indians.    What I wish to show to you, I mean more especially the candidates for  the Indian Civil Service, is that this India of a thousand, or two  thousand, or three thousand years ago, ay the India of to-day also, if  only you know where to look for it, is full of problems, the solution  of which concerns all of us, even us in this Europe of the nineteenth  century.    If you have acquired any special tastes here in England, you will find  plenty to satisfy them in India; and whoever has learned to take an  interest in any of the great problems that occupy the best thinkers  and workers at home, need certainly not be afraid of India proving to  him an intellectual exile.    If you care for geology, there is work for you from the Himalayas to  Ceylon.    If you are fond of botany, there is a flora rich enough for many  Hookers.    If you are a zoologist, think of Haeckel, who is just now rushing  through Indian forests and dredging in Indian seas, and to whom his  stay in India is like the realization of the brightest dream of his  life.    If you are interested in ethnology, why India is like a living  ethnological museum.    If you are fond of archaeology, if you have ever assisted at the  opening of a barrow in England, and know the delight of finding a  fibula, or a knife, or a flint in a heap of rubbish, read only General  Cunningham's \"Annual Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India,\"  and you will be impatient for the time when you can take your spade  and bring to light the ancient Viharas or colleges built by the  Buddhist monarchs of India.    If ever you amused yourselves with collecting coins, why the soil of  India teems with coins, Persian, Carian, Thracian, Parthian, Greek,  Macedonian, Scythian, Roman,[1] and Mohammedan. When Warren Hastings  was Governor-General, an earthen pot was found on the bank of a river  in the province of Benares, containing one hundred and seventy-two  gold darics.[2] Warren Hastings considered himself as making the most  munificent present to his masters that he might ever have it in his  power to send them, by presenting those ancient coins to the Court of  Directors. The story is that they were sent to the melting-pot. At all  events they had disappeared when Warren Hastings returned to England.  It rests with you to prevent the revival of such vandalism.    In one of the last numbers of the _Asiatic Journal of Bengal_ you may  read of the discovery of a treasure as rich in gold almost as some of  the tombs opened by Dr. Schliemann at Mykenae, nay, I should add,  perhaps, not quite unconnected with some of the treasures found at  Mykenae; yet hardly any one has taken notice of it in England![3]    The study of Mythology has assumed an entirely new character, chiefly  owing to the light that has been thrown on it by the ancient Vedic  Mythology of India. But though the foundation of a true Science of  Mythology has been laid, all the detail has still to be worked out,  and could be worked out nowhere better than in India.    Even the study of fables owes its new life to India, from whence the  various migrations of fables have been traced at various times and  through various channels from East to West.[4] Buddhism is now known  to have been the principal source of our legends and parables. But  here, too, many problems still wait for their solution. Think, for  instance, of the allusion to the fable of the donkey in the lion's  skin, which occurs in Plato's Cratylus.[5] Was that borrowed from the  East? Or take the fable of the weasel changed by Aphrodite into a  woman who, when she saw a mouse, could not refrain from making a  spring at it. This, too, is very like a Sanskrit fable; but how then  could it have been brought into Greece early enough to appear in one  of the comedies of Strattis, about 400 B.C.?[6] Here, too, there is  still plenty of work to do.    We may go back even farther into antiquity, and still find strange  coincidences between the legends of India and the legends of the West,  without as yet being able to say how they travelled, whether from East  to West, or from West to East. That at the time of Solomon there was a  channel of communication open between India and Syria and Palestine is  established beyond doubt, I believe, by certain Sanskrit words which  occur in the Bible as names of articles of export from Ophir, articles  such as ivory, apes, peacocks, and sandalwood, which, taken together,  could not have been exported from any country but India.[7] Nor is  there any reason to suppose that the commercial intercourse between  India, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean was ever  completely interrupted, even at the time when the Book of Kings is  supposed to have been written.    Now you remember the judgment of Solomon, which has always been  admired as a proof of great legal wisdom among the Jews.[8] I must  confess that, not having a legal mind, I never could suppress a  certain shudder[9] when reading the decision of Solomon: \"Divide the  living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.\"    Let me now tell you the same story as it is told by the Buddhists,  whose sacred Canon is full of such legends and parables. In the  Kanjur, which is the Tibetan translation of the Buddhist Tripi_t_aka,  we likewise read of two women who claimed each to be the mother of the  same child. The king, after listening to their quarrels for a long  time, gave it up as hopeless to settle who was the real mother. Upon  this Vi_s_akha stepped forward and said: \"What is the use of examining  and cross-examining these women? Let them take the boy and settle it  among themselves.\" Thereupon both women fell on the child, and when  the fight became violent the child was hurt and began to cry. Then one  of them let him go, because she could not bear to hear the child cry.    That settled the question. The king gave the child to the true mother,  and had the other beaten with a rod.    This seems to me, if not the more primitive, yet the more natural form  of the story--showing a deeper knowledge of human nature and more  wisdom than even the wisdom of Solomon.[10]    Many of you may have studied not only languages, but also the Science  of Language, and is there any country in which some of the most  important problems of that science, say only the growth and decay of  dialects, or the possible mixture of languages, with regard not only  to words, but to grammatical elements also, can be studied to greater  advantage than among the Aryan, the Dravidian, and the Mu_n_da  inhabitants of India, when brought in contact with their various  invaders and conquerors, the Greeks, the Yue-tchi, the Arabs, the  Persians, the Moguls, and lastly the English?    Again, if you are a student of Jurisprudence, there is a history of  law to be explored in India, very different from what is known of the  history of law in Greece, in Rome, and in Germany, yet both by its  contrasts and by its similarities full of suggestions to the student  of Comparative Jurisprudence. New materials are being discovered every  year, as, for instance, the so-called Dharma or Samaya_k_arika Sutras,  which have supplied the materials for the later metrical law-books,  such as the famous Laws of Manu. What was once called \"The Code of  Laws of Manu,\" and confidently referred to 1200, or at least 500 B.C.,  is now hesitatingly referred to perhaps the fourth century A.D., and  called neither a Code, nor a Code of Laws, least of all, the Code of  Laws of Manu.    If you have learned to appreciate the value of recent researches into  the antecedents of all law, namely the foundation and growth of the  simplest political communities--and nowhere could you have had better  opportunities for it than here at Cambridge--you will find a field of  observation opened before you in the still-existing village estates in  India that will amply repay careful research.    And take that which, after all, whether we confess or deny it, we care  for more in this life than for anything else--nay, which is often far  more cared for by those who deny than by those who confess--take that  which supports, pervades, and directs all our acts and thoughts and  hopes--without which there can be neither village-community nor empire,  neither custom nor law, neither right nor wrong--take that which, next  to language, has most firmly fixed the specific and permanent barrier  between man and beast--which alone has made life possible and bearable,  and which, as it is the deepest, though often-hidden spring of  individual life, is also the foundation of all national life--the  history of all histories, and yet the mystery of all mysteries--take  religion, and where can you study its true origin,[11] its natural  growth, and its inevitable decay better than in India, the home of  Brahmanism, the birthplace of Buddhism, and the refuge of  Zoroastrianism, even now the mother of new superstitions--and why not,  in the future, the regenerate child of the purest faith, if only  purified from the dust of nineteen centuries?    You will find yourselves everywhere in India between an immense past  and an immense future, with opportunities such as the old world could  but seldom, if ever, offer you. Take any of the burning questions of  the day--popular education, higher education, parliamentary  representation, codification of laws, finance, emigration, poor-law;  and whether you have anything to teach and to try, or anything to  observe and to learn, India will supply you with a laboratory such as  exists nowhere else.
