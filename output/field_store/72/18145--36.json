He has been ill, and is not very strong.  I hope you will give him no trouble, and I can tell you it will be  the worse for you, if you do. I am going to look into matters  myself; and I shall have a report sent me in, regularly, as to how  each of you is getting on, with a special remark as to conduct; and  I can tell you, if any of you are troublesome you will find me down  at your father's, in no time.\"    The squire's words had considerable effect, and an unusual quiet  reigned in the school, after he had left and the new schoolmaster  opened a book.    They soon found that his method of teaching was very different to  that which they were accustomed to. There was no shouting or  thumping on the desk with the cane, no pulling of ears or cuffing  of heads. Everything was explained quietly and clearly; and when  they went out of the school, all agreed that the new master was a  great improvement on Master White, while the master himself  reported to his wife that he had got on better than he had  expected.        Chapter 2: The Poisoned Dog.      The boys soon felt that Mr. Shrewsbury really wished to teach them,  and that he was ready to assist those who wanted to get on. In the  afternoon the schoolmaster's wife started a sewing class for the  girls and, a week or two after he came, the master announced that  such of the elder class of boys and girls who chose to come, in the  evening, to his cottage could do so for an hour; and that he and  the boys would read, by turns, some amusing book while the girls  worked. Only Reuben Whitney and two or three others at first  availed themselves of the invitation, but these spoke so highly of  their evening that the number soon increased. Three quarters of an  hour were spent in reading some interesting work of travel or  adventure, and then the time was occupied in talking over what they  had read, and in explaining anything which they did not understand;  and as the evenings were now long and dark, the visits to the  schoolmaster soon came to be regarded as a privilege, and proved an  incentive to work to those in the lower classes, only those in the  first place being admitted to them.    Reuben worked hard all through the winter, and made very rapid  progress; the schoolmaster, seeing how eager he was to get on,  doing everything in his power to help him forward, and lending him  books to study at home. One morning in the spring, the squire  looked in at Mrs. Whitney's shop.    \"Mrs. Whitney,\" he said, \"I don't know what you are thinking of  doing with that boy of yours. Mr. Shrewsbury gives me an excellent  account of him, and says that he is far and away the cleverest and  most studious of the boys. I like the lad, and owe him a good turn  for having broken in that pony for my daughter; besides, for his  father's sake I should like to help him on. Now, in the first  place, what are you thinking of doing with him?\"    \"I am sure I am very much obliged to you,\" Mrs. Whitney said. \"I  was thinking, when he gets a little older, of apprenticing him to  some trade, but he is not fourteen yet.\"    \"The best thing you can do, Mrs. Whitney. Let it be some good  trade, where he can use his wits--not a butcher, a baker, or a  tailor, or anything of that sort. I should say an upholsterer, or a  mill wright, or some trade where his intelligence can help him on.  When the time comes I shall be glad to pay his apprentice fees for  him, and perhaps, when you tell me what line he has chosen, a word  from me to one of the tradesmen in Lewes may be a help. In the  meantime, that is not what I have specially come about. Young  Finch, who looks to my garden, is going to leave; and if you like,  your boy can have the place. My gardener knows his business  thoroughly, and the boy can learn under him. I will pay him five  shillings a week. It will break him into work a little, and he is  getting rather old for the school now. I have spoken to Shrewsbury,  and he says that, if the boy is disposed to go on studying in the  evening, he will direct his work and help him on.\"    \"Thank you kindly, sir,\" Mrs. Whitney said. \"I think it will just  be the thing, for a year or so, before he is apprenticed. He was  saying only last night that he was the biggest boy in the school;  and though I know he likes learning, he would like to be helping  me, and feels somehow that it isn't right that he should be going  on schooling, while all the other boys at his age are doing  something. Not that I want him to earn money, for the shop keeps us  both; but it's what he thinks about it.\"    \"That's natural enough, Mrs. Whitney, and anything the boy earns  with me, you see, you can put by, and it will come in useful to him  some day.\"    Reuben was glad when he heard of the arrangement; for although, as  his mother had said, he was fond of school, he yet felt it as a  sort of reproach that, while others of his age were earning money,  he should be doing nothing. He accepted the offer of the  schoolmaster to continue to work at his studies in the evening, and  in a week he was installed in Tom Finch's place.    The arrangement was not the squire's original idea, but that of his  younger daughter, who felt a sort of proprietary interest in  Reuben; partly because her evidence had cleared him of the  accusation of breaking the windows, partly because he had broken in  the pony for her; so when she heard that the boy was leaving, she  had at once asked her father that Reuben should take his place.    \"I think he is a good boy, papa,\" she said; \"and if he was clever  enough to break in my pony, I am sure he will be clever enough to  wheel the wheelbarrow and pull weeds.\"    \"I should think he would, lassie,\" her father said, laughing,  \"although it does not exactly follow. Still, if you guarantee that  he is a good boy, I will see about it.\"    \"Mamma doesn't think he is a very good boy,\" Kate said; \"but you  see, papa, mamma is a woman, and perhaps she doesn't understand  boys and girls as well as I do. I think he's good, and he told me  he never told stories.\"    The squire laughed.    \"I don't know what your mamma would say to that, puss; nor whether  she would agree that you understand boys and girls better than she  does. However, I will take your opinion this time, and give Reuben  a chance.\"    The subject was not mentioned again in Kate's hearing, but she was  greatly pleased, one morning, at seeing Reuben at work in the  gardens.    \"Good morning, Reuben,\" she said.    \"Good morning, miss,\" he replied, touching his hat.    \"I am glad you have come in Tom's place, and I hope you will be  good, and not get into scrapes, for I told papa I thought you would  not; and you see, if you do, he will turn round and blame me.\"    \"I will try not to get into scrapes, Miss Kate,\" Reuben said. \"I  don't do it often, you know, and I don't think there will be much  chance of it, here.\"    Kate nodded and walked on, and Reuben went about his work.    There was, however, much more opportunity for getting into scrapes  than Reuben imagined, although the scrapes were not of the kind he  had pictured. Being naturally careless, he had not been there a  week before, in his eagerness to get home to a particularly  interesting book, he forgot to carry out his orders to shut the  cucumber frames and, a sharp frost coming on in the night, the  plants were all killed; to the immense indignation of the gardener,  who reported the fact, with a very serious face, to the squire.    \"I am afraid that boy will never do, squire. Such carelessness I  never did see, and them plants was going on beautifully.\"    \"Confound the young rascal!\" the squire said wrathfully, for he was  fond of cucumbers. \"I will speak to him myself. This sort of thing  will never do.\"    And accordingly, the squire spoke somewhat sharply to Reuben, who  was really sorry for the damage his carelessness had caused; and he  not only promised the squire that it should not occur again, but  mentally resolved very firmly that it should not. He felt very  shamefaced when Kate passed him in the garden, with a serious shake  of her head, signifying that she was shocked that he had thus early  got into a scrape, and discredited her recommendation.    The lesson was a useful one. Henceforth Reuben paid closer  attention to his work, and even the gardener, who regarded boys as  his great trial in life, expressed himself satisfied with him.    \"Since that affair of the cucumbers I must own, squire,\" he said a  month later, \"that he is the best boy I have come across. He  attends to what I say and remembers it, and I find I can trust him  to do jobs that I have never been able to trust boys with, before.  He seems to take an interest in it, and as he is well spoken and  civil, he ought to get on and make a good gardener, in time.\"    \"I am glad to hear a good account of him,\" the squire replied. \"He  is sharp and intelligent, and will make his way in life, or I am  mistaken. His father was an uncommonly clever fellow, though he  made a mess of it, just at the end; and I think the boy takes after  him.\"    Among Reuben's other duties was that of feeding and attending to  the dogs. These consisted of two setters, a pointer, and a large  house dog, who was chained up at the entrance to the stables.  Reuben was soon excellent friends with the sporting dogs, but the  watchdog, who had probably been teased by Reuben's predecessor,  always growled and showed his teeth when he went near him; and  Reuben never dared venture within the length of his chain, but  pushed the bowl containing his food just within his reach.    One day, he had been sent on an errand to the stables. He forgot  the dog and ran close to the kennel. The animal at once sprang out.  Reuben made a rush, but he was not quick enough, and the dog caught  him by the leg."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#4)"],[1,"llars, three in number, and chiefly used as  lumber-rooms, were deep down and dank and horrid.    On the first floor eight bedrooms opened on to a gallery overlooking  the hall, and the top storey, where the servants slept, consisted  solely of attics connected with one another by dark, narrow passages.  It was one of these attics that was haunted, although, as a matter of  fact, the ghost had been seen in all parts of the house.    When Letty entered the Admiral's service she was but a bairn, and had  never even heard of ghosts; nor did the other servants apprise her of  the hauntings, having received strict injunctions not to do so from  the Laird.    But Letty's home, humble though it was, had been very bright and  cheerful, and the dark precincts of the mansion filled her with  dismay. Without exactly knowing why she was afraid, she shrank in  terror from descending into the cellars, and felt anything but pleased  at the prospect of sleeping alone in an attic. Still nothing occurred  to really alarm her till about a month after her arrival. It was early  in the evening, soon after twilight, and she had gone down into one of  the cellars to look for a boot-jack, which the Admiral swore by all  that was holy must be found before supper. Placing the light she had  brought with her on a packing-case, she was groping about among the  boxes, when she perceived, to her astonishment, that the flame of the  candle had suddenly turned blue. She then felt icy cold, and was much  startled on hearing a loud clatter as of some metal instrument on the  stone floor in the far-off corner of the cellar. Glancing in the  direction of the noise, she saw, looking at her, two eyes--two  obliquely set, lurid, light eyes, full of the utmost devilry. Sick  with terror and utterly unable to account for what she beheld, she  stood stock-still, her limbs refusing to move, her throat parched, her  tongue tied. The clanging was repeated, and a shadowy form began  slowly to crawl towards her. She dared not afterwards surmise what  would have happened to her, had not the Laird himself come down at  this moment. At the sound of his stentorian voice the phantasm  vanished. But the shock had been too much for Letty; she fainted, and  the Admiral, carrying her upstairs as carefully as if she had been his  own daughter, gave peremptory orders that she should never again be  allowed to go into the cellar alone.    But now that Letty herself had witnessed a manifestation, the other  servants no longer felt bound to secrecy, and soon poured into her  ears endless accounts of the hauntings.    Every one, they informed her, except Master Gregory and Perkins (the  butler) had seen one or other of the ghosts, and the cellar  apparition was quite familiar to them all. They also declared that  there were other parts of the house quite as badly haunted as the  cellar, and it might have been partly owing to these gruesome stories  that poor Letty always felt scared, when crossing the passages leading  to the attics. As she was hastening down one of them, early one  morning, she heard some one running after her. Thinking it was one of  the other servants, she turned round, pleased to think that some one  else was up early too, and saw to her horror a dreadful-looking  object, that seemed to be partly human and partly animal. The body was  quite small, and its face bloated, and covered with yellow spots. It  had an enormous animal mouth, the lips of which, moving furiously  without emitting any sound, showed that the creature was endeavouring  to speak but could not. The moment Letty screamed for help the  phantasm vanished.    But her worst experience was yet to come. The spare attic which she  was told was so badly haunted that no one would sleep in it, was the  room next to hers. It was a room Letty could well believe was  haunted, for she had never seen another equally gloomy. The ceiling  was low and sloping, the window tiny, and the walls exhibited all  sorts of odd nooks and crannies. A bed, antique and worm-eaten, stood  in one recess, a black oak chest in another, and at right angles with  the door, in another recess, stood a wardrobe that used to creak and  groan alarmingly every time Letty walked a long the passage. Once she  heard a chuckle, a low, diabolical chuckle, which she fancied came  from the chest; and once, when the door of the room was open, she  caught the glitter of a pair of eyes--the same pale, malevolent eyes  that had so frightened her in the cellar. From her earliest childhood  Letty had been periodically given to somnambulism, and one night, just  about a year after she went into service, she got out of bed, and  walked, in her sleep, into the Haunted Room. She awoke to find herself  standing, cold and shivering, in the middle of the floor, and it was  some seconds before she realised where she was. Her horror, when she  did discover where she was, is not easily described. The room was  bathed in moonlight, and the beams, falling with noticeable  brilliancy on each piece of furniture the room contained, at once  riveted Letty's attention, and so fascinated her that she found  herself utterly unable to move. A terrible and most unusual silence  predominated everywhere, and although Letty's senses were wonderfully  and painfully on the alert, she could not catch the slightest sound  from any of the rooms on the landing.    The night was absolutely still, no breath of wind, no rustle of  leaves, no flapping of ivy against the window; yet the door suddenly  swung back on its hinges and slammed furiously. Letty felt that this  was the work of some supernatural agency, and, fully expecting that  the noise had awakened the cook, who was a light sleeper (or pretended  she was), listened in a fever of excitement to hear her get out of bed  and call out. The slightest noise and the spell that held her prisoner  would, Letty felt sure, be broken. But the same unbroken silence  prevailed. A sudden rustling made Letty glance fearfully at the bed;  and she perceived, to her terror, the valance swaying violently, to  and fro. Sick with fear, she was now constrained to stare in abject  helplessness. Presently there was a slight, very slight movement on  the mattress, the white dust cover rose, and, under it, Letty saw the  outlines of what she took to be a human figure, gradually take shape.  Hoping, praying, that she was mistaken, and that what appeared to be  on the bed was but a trick of her imagination, she continued staring  in an agony of anticipation. But the figure remained--extended at full  length like a corpse. The minutes slowly passed, a church clock boomed  two, and the body moved. Letty's jaw fell, her eyes almost bulged from  her head, whilst her fingers closed convulsively on the folds of her  night-dress. The unmistakable sound of breathing now issued from the  region of the bed, and the dust-cover commenced slowly to slip aside.  Inch by inch it moved, until first of all Letty saw a few wisps of  dark hair, then a few more, then a thick cluster; then something white  and shining--a protruding forehead; then dark, very dark brows; then  two eyelids, yellow, swollen, and fortunately tightly closed; then--a  purple conglomeration of Letty knew not what--of anything but what  was human. The sight was so monstrous it appalled her; and she was  overcome with a species of awe and repulsion, for which the language  of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression. She momentarily  forgot that what she looked on was merely superphysical, but regarded  it as something alive, something that ought to have been a child,  comely and healthy as herself--and she hated it. It was an outrage on  maternity, a blot on nature, a filthy discredit to the house, a  blight, a sore, a gangrene. It turned over in its sleep, the cover was  hurled aside, and a grotesque object, round, pulpy, webbed, and of  leprous whiteness--an object which Letty could hardly associate with a  hand--came grovelling out. Letty's stomach heaved; the thing was  beastly, indecent, vile, it ought not to live! And the idea of killing  flashed through her mind. Boiling over with indignation and absurdly  forgetful of her surroundings, she turned round and groped for a stone  to smash it. The moonlight on her naked toes brought her to her  senses--the thing in the bed was a devil! Though brought up a member  of the Free Church, with an abhorrence of anything that could in any  way be contorted into Papist practices, Letty crossed herself. As she  did so, a noise in the passage outside augmented her terror. She  strained her ears painfully, and the sound developed into a footstep,  soft, light, and surreptitious. It came gently towards the door; it  paused outside, and Letty intuitively felt that it was listening. Her  suspense was now so intolerable, that it was almost with a feeling of  relief that she beheld the door slowly--very slowly--begin to open. A  little wider--a little wider--and yet a little wider; but still  nothing came. Ah! Letty's heart turned to ice. Another inch, and a  shadowy something slipped through and began to wriggle itself  stealthily over the floor. Letty tried to divert her gaze, but could  not--an irresistible, magnetic attraction kept her eyes glued to the  gradually approaching horror. When within a few feet of her it halted;  and again Letty felt it was listening--listening to the breathing on  the bed, which was heavy and bestial. Then it twisted round, and Letty  watched it crawl into the wardrobe. After this there was a long and  anxious wait. Then Letty saw the wardrobe door slyly open, and the  eyes of the cellar--inexpressibly baleful, and glittering like  burnished steel in the strong phosphorescent glow of the moon, peep  out,--not at her but _through_ her,--at the object lying on the bed.  There were not only eyes, this time, but a form,--vague, misty, and  irregular, but still with sufficient shape to enable Letty to identify "]]]
