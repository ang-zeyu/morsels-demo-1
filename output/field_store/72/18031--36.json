This may be seen in one of the above examples. It was argued that a  certain metal must be copper, because every metal is copper that turns  green when dipped in vinegar. So far the proof appealed to a general  proposition, and was deductive. But when we ask how the general  proposition is known to be true, experiments or facts must be alleged;  and this is inductive evidence. Deduction then depends on Induction. But  if we ask, again, how any number of past experiments can prove a general  proposition, which must be good for the future as well as for the past,  the uniformity of causation is invoked; that is, appeal is made to a  principle, and that again is deductive proof. Induction then depends  upon Deduction.    We may put it in this way: Deduction depends on Induction, if general  propositions are only known to us through the facts: Induction depends  on Deduction, because one fact can never prove another, except so far as  what is true of the one is true of the other and of any other of the  same kind; and because, to exhibit this resemblance of the facts, it  must be stated in a general proposition.    Sec. 4. The use of Logic is often disputed: those who have not studied it,  often feel confident of their ability to do without it; those who have  studied it, are sometimes disgusted with what they consider to be its  superficial analysis of the grounds of evidence, or needless  technicality in the discussion of details. As to those who, not having  studied Logic, yet despise it, there will be time enough to discuss its  utility with them, when they know something about it; and as for those  who, having studied it, turn away in disgust, whether they are justified  every man must judge for himself, when he has attained to equal  proficiency in the subject. Meanwhile, the following considerations may  be offered in its favour:    Logic states, and partly explains and applies, certain abstract  principles which all other sciences take for granted; namely, the axioms  above mentioned--the principles of Contradiction, of the Syllogism and  of Causation. By exercising the student in the apprehension of these  truths, and in the application of them to particular propositions, it  educates the power of abstract thought. Every science is a model of  method, a discipline in close and consecutive thinking; and this merit  Logic ought to possess in a high degree.    For ages Logic has served as an introduction to Philosophy that is, to  Metaphysics and speculative Ethics. It is of old and honourable  descent: a man studies Logic in very good company. It is the warp upon  which nearly the whole web of ancient, mediaeval and modern Philosophy is  woven. The history of thought is hardly intelligible without it.    As the science of proof, Logic gives an account of the _general_ nature  of evidence deductive and inductive, as applied in the physical and  social sciences and in the affairs of life. The _general_ nature of such  evidence: it would be absurd of the logician to pretend to instruct the  chemist, economist and merchant, as to the _special_ character of the  evidence requisite in their several spheres of judgment. Still, by  investigating the general conditions of proof, he sets every man upon  his guard against the insufficiency of evidence.    One application of the science of proof deserves special mention:  namely, to that department of Rhetoric which has been the most  developed, relating to persuasion by means of oratory, leader-writing,  or pamphleteering. It is usually said that Logic is useful to convince  the judgment, not to persuade the will: but one way of persuading the  will is to convince the judgment that a certain course is advantageous;  and although this is not always the readiest way, it is the most  honourable, and leads to the most enduring results. Logic is the  backbone of Rhetoric.    It has been disputed whether Logic is a science or an art; and, in fact,  it may be considered in both ways. As a statement of general truths, of  their relations to one another, and especially to the first principles,  it is a science; but it is an art when, regarding truth as an end  desired, it points out some of the means of attaining it--namely, to  proceed by a regular method, to test every judgment by the principles of  Logic, and to distrust whatever cannot be made consistent with them.  Logic does not, in the first place, teach us to reason. We learn to  reason as we learn to walk and talk, by the natural growth of our powers  with some assistance from friends and neighbours. The way to develop  one's power of reasoning is, first, to set oneself problems and try to  solve them. Secondly, since the solving of a problem depends upon one's  ability to call to mind parallel cases, one must learn as many facts as  possible, and keep on learning all one's life; for nobody ever knew  enough. Thirdly one must check all results by the principles of Logic.  It is because of this checking, verifying, corrective function of Logic  that it is sometimes called a Regulative or Normative Science. It cannot  give any one originality or fertility of invention; but it enables us to  check our inferences, revise our conclusions, and chasten the vagaries  of ambitious speculation. It quickens our sense of bad reasoning both in  others and in ourselves. A man who reasons deliberately, manages it  better after studying Logic than he could before, if he is sincere about  it and has common sense.    Sec. 5. The relation of Logic to other sciences:    (a) Logic is regarded by Spencer as co-ordinate with Mathematics, both  being Abstract Sciences--that is, sciences of the _relations_ in which  things stand to one another, whatever the particular things may be that  are so related; and this view seems to be, on the whole, just--subject,  however, to qualifications that will appear presently.    Mathematics treats of the relations of all sorts of things considered as  quantities, namely, as equal to, or greater or less than, one another.  Things may be quantitatively equal or unequal in _degree_, as in  comparing the temperature of bodies; or in _duration_; or in _spatial  magnitude_, as with lines, superficies, solids; or in _number_. And it  is assumed that the equality or inequality of things that cannot be  directly compared, may be proved indirectly on the assumption that  'things equal to the same thing are equal,' etc.    Logic also treats of the relations of all sorts of things, but not as to  their quantity. It considers (i) that one thing may be like or unlike  another in certain attributes, as that iron is in many ways like tin or  lead, and in many ways unlike carbon or sulphur: (ii) that attributes  co-exist or coinhere (or do not) in the same subject, as metallic  lustre, hardness, a certain atomic weight and a certain specific gravity  coinhere in iron: and (iii) that one event follows another (or is the  effect of it), as that the placing of iron in water causes it to rust.  The relations of likeness and of coinherence are the ground of  Classification; for it is by resemblance of coinhering attributes that  things form classes: coinherence is the ground of judgments concerning  Substance and Attribute, as that iron is metallic; and the relation of  succession, in the mode of Causation, is the chief subject of the  department of Induction. It is usual to group together these relations  of attributes and of order in time, and call them qualitative, in order  to contrast them with the quantitative relations which belong to  Mathematics. And it is assumed that qualitative relations of things,  when they cannot be directly perceived, may be proved indirectly by  assuming the axiom of the Syllogism (chap. ix.) and the law of Causation  (chap. xiv.).    So far, then, Logic and Mathematics appear to be co-ordinate and  distinct sciences. But we shall see hereafter that the satisfactory  treatment of that special order of events in time which constitutes  Causation, requires a combination of Logic with Mathematics; and so does  the treatment of Probability. And, again, Logic may be said to be, in a  certain sense, 'prior to' or 'above' Mathematics as usually treated. For  the Mathematics assume that one magnitude must be either equal or  unequal to another, and that it cannot be both equal and unequal to it,  and thus take for granted the principles of Contradiction and Excluded  Middle; but the statement and elucidation of these Principles are left  to Logic (chap. vi.). The Mathematics also classify and define  magnitudes, as (in Geometry) triangles, squares, cubes, spheres; but the  principles of classification and definition remain for Logic to  discuss.    (b) As to the concrete Sciences, such as Astronomy, Chemistry, Zoology,  Sociology--Logic (as well as Mathematics) is implied in them all; for  all the propositions of which they consist involve causation,  co-existence, and class-likeness. Logic is therefore said to be prior to  them or above them: meaning by 'prior' not that it should be studied  earlier, for that is not a good plan; meaning by 'above' not in dignity,  for distinctions of dignity amongst liberal studies are absurd. But it  is a philosophical idiom to call the abstract 'prior to,' or 'higher  than,' the concrete (see Porphyry's Tree, chap. xxii. Sec. 8); and Logic is  more abstract than Astronomy or Sociology. Philosophy may thank that  idiom for many a foolish notion.    (c) But, as we have seen, Logic does not investigate the truth,  trustworthiness, or validity of its own principles; nor does  Mathematics: this task belongs to Metaphysics, or Epistemology, the  criticism of knowledge and beliefs.    Logic assumes, for example, that things are what to a careful scrutiny  they seem to be; that animals, trees, mountains, planets,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#4)"],[1,"the Gregorian  dignity of its origin.    Karl Philip Emanuel Bach, called \"the Berlin Bach\" to distinguish him  from his father, the great Sebastian Bach of Saxe Weimar, was born in  Weimar, March 14, 1714. He early devoted himself to music, and coming to  Berlin when twenty-four years old was appointed Chamber musician (Kammer  Musicus) in the Royal Chapel, where he often accompanied Frederick the  Great (who was an accomplished flutist) on the harpsichord. His most  numerous compositions were piano music but he wrote a celebrated  \"Sanctus,\" and two oratorios, besides a number of chorals, of which  \"Weimar\" is one. He died in Hamburg, Dec. 14, 1788.      THE MAGNIFICAT.  [Greek: Megalunei he psuche mou ton Kurion.]        Magnificat anima mea Dominum,      Et exultavit Spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo.                                        Luke 1:46-55.    We can date with some certainty the hymn itself composed by the Virgin  Mary, but when it first became a song of the Christian Church no one can  tell. Its thanksgiving may have found tone among the earliest martyrs,  who, as Pliny tells us, sang hymns in their secret worship. We can only  trace it back to the oldest chant music, when it was doubtless sung by  both the Eastern and Western Churches. In the rude liturgies of the 4th  and 5th centuries it must have begun to assume ritual form; but it  remained for the more modern school of composers hundreds of years later  to illustrate the \"Magnificat\" with the melody of art and genius.  Superseding the primitive unisonous plain-song, the old parallel  concords, and the simple faburden (faux bourdon) counterpoint that  succeeded Gregory, they taught how musical tones can better assist  worship with the beauty of harmony and the precision of scientific  taste. Musicians in Italy, France, Germany and England have contributed  their scores to this inspired hymn. Some of them still have place in the  hymnals, a noble one especially by the blind English tone-master, Henry  Smart, author of the oratorio of \"Jacob.\" None, however, have equaled  the work of Handel. His \"Magnificat\" was one of his favorite  productions, and he borrowed strains from it in several of his later and  lesser productions.    George Frederic Handel, author of the immortal \"Messiah,\" was born at  Halle, Saxony, in 1685, and died in London in 1759. The musical bent of  his genius was apparent almost from his infancy. At the age of eighteen  he was earning his living with his violin, and writing his first opera.  After a sojourn in Italy, he settled in Hanover as Chapel Master to the  Elector, who afterwards became the English king, George I. The  friendship of the king and several of his noblemen drew him to England,  where he spent forty-seven years and composed his greatest works.    He wrote three hymn-tunes (it is said at the request of a converted  actress), \"Canons,\" \"Fitzwilliam,\" and \"Gopsall,\" the first an  invitation, \"Sinners, Obey the Gospel Word,\" the second a meditation, \"O  Love Divine, How Sweet Thou Art,\" and the third a resurrection song to  Welsey's words \"Rejoice, the Lord is King.\" This last still survives in  some hymnals.      THE DOXOLOGIES.        Be Thou, O God, exalted high,      And as Thy glory fills the sky      So let it be on earth displayed      Till Thou art here as there obeyed.    This sublime quatrain, attributed to Nahum Tate, like the Lord's Prayer,  is suited to all occasions, to all Christian denominations, and to all  places and conditions of men. It has been translated into all civilized  languages, and has been rising to heaven for many generations from  congregations round the globe wherever the faith of Christendom has  built its altars. This doxology is the first stanza of a sixteen line  hymn (possibly longer originally), the rest of which is forgotten.    Nahum Tate was born in Dublin, in 1652, and educated there at Trinity  College. He was appointed poet-laureate by King William III. in 1690,  and it was in conjunction with Dr. Nicholas Brady that he executed his  \"New\" metrical version of the Psalms. The entire Psalter, with an  appendix of Hymns, was licensed by William and Mary and published in  1703. The _hymns_ in the volume are all by Tate. He died in London, Aug.  12, 1717.    Rev. Nicholas Brady, D.D., was an Irishman, son of an officer in the  royal army, and was born at Bandon, County of Cork, Oct. 28, 1659. He  studied in the Westminster School at Oxford, but afterwards entered  Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1685. William made him  Queen Mary's Chaplain. He died May 20, 1726.    The other nearly contemporary form of doxology is in common use, but  though elevated and devotional in spirit, it cannot be universal, owing  to its credal line being objectionable to non-Trinitarian Protestants:        Praise God from whom all blessings flow,      Praise Him all creatures here below,      Praise Him above, ye heavenly host,      Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost.    The author, the Rev. Thomas Ken, was born in Berkhampstead,  Hertfordshire, Eng., July, 1637, and was educated at Winchester School,  Hertford College, and New College, Oxford. In 1662 he took holy orders,  and seventeen years later the king (Charles II.) appointed him chaplain  to his sister Mary, Princess of Orange. Later the king, just before his  death, made him Bishop of Bath and Wells.    Like John the Baptist, and Bourdaloue, and Knox, he was a faithful  spiritual monitor and adviser during all his days at court. \"I must go  in and hear Ken tell me my faults,\" the king used to say at chapel time.  The \"good little man\" (as he called the bishop) never lost the favor of  the dissipated monarch. As Macaulay says, \"Of all the prelates, he liked  Ken the best.\"    Under James, the Papist, Ken was a loyal subject, though once arrested  as one of the \"seven bishops\" for his opposition to the king's religion,  and he kept his oath of allegiance so firmly that it cost him his place.  William III. deprived him of his bishopric, and he retired in poverty to  a home kindly offered him by Lord Viscount Weymouth in Longleat, near  Frome, in Somersetshire, where he spent a serene and beloved old age. He  died aet. seventy-four, March 17, 1711 (N.S.), and was carried to his  grave, according to his request, by \"six of the poorest men in the  parish.\"    His great doxology is the refrain or final stanza of each of his three  long hymns, \"Morning,\" \"Evening\" and \"Midnight,\" printed in a _Prayer  Manual_ for the use of the students of Winchester College. The \"Evening  Hymn\" drew scenic inspiration, it is told, from the lovely view in  Horningsham Park at \"Heaven's Gate Hill,\" while walking to and from  church.    Another four-line doxology, adopted probably from Dr. Hatfield  (1807-1883), is almost entirely superseded by Ken's stanza, being of  even more pronounced credal character.        To God the Father, God the Son,      And God the Spirit, Three in One.      Be honor, praise and glory given      By all on earth and all in heaven.    The _Methodist Hymnal_ prints a collection of ten doxologies, two by  Watts, one by Charles Wesley, one by John Wesley, one by William Goode,  one by Edwin F. Hatfield, one attributed to \"Tate and Brady,\" one by  Robert Hawkes, and the one by Ken above noted. These are all technically  and intentionally doxologies. To give a history of doxologies in the  general sense of the word would carry one through every Christian age  and language and end with a concordance of the Book of Psalms.    [Illustration: Oliver Holden]      _THE TUNE._    Few would think of any music more appropriate to a standard doxology  than \"Old Hundred.\" This grand Gregorian harmony has been claimed to be  Luther's production, while some have believed that Louis Bourgeois,  editor of the French _Genevan Psalter_, composed the tune, but the  weight of evidence seems to indicate that it was the work of Guillaume  le Franc, (William Franck or William the Frenchman,) of Rouen, in  France, who founded a music school in Geneva, 1541. He was Chapel Master  there, but removed to Lausanne, where he played in the Catholic choir  and wrote the tunes for an Edition of Marot's and Beza's Psalms. Died in  Lausanne, 1570.      \"THE LORD DESCENDED FROM ABOVE.\"    A flash of genuine inspiration was vouchsafed to Thomas Sternhold when  engaged with Rev. John Hopkins in versifying the Eighteenth Psalm. The  ridicule heaped upon Sternhold and Hopkins's psalmbook has always  stopped, and sobered into admiration and even reverence at the two  stanzas beginning with this leading line--        The Lord descended from above        And bowed the heavens most high,      And underneath His feet He cast        The darkness of the sky.        On cherub and on cherubim        Full royally He rode,      And on the wings of mighty winds        Came flying all abroad.    Thomas Sternhold was born in Gloucestershire, Eng. He was Groom of the  Robes to Henry VIII, and Edward VI., but is only remembered for his  _Psalter_ published in 1562, thirteen years after his death in 1549.      _THE TUNE._    \"Nottingham\" (now sometimes entitled \"St. Magnus\") is a fairly good echo  of the grand verses, a dignified but spirited choral in A flat. Jeremiah  Clark, the composer, was born in London, 1670. Educated at the Chapel  Royal, he became organist of Winchester College and finally to St.  Paul's Cathedral where he was appointed Gentleman of the Chapel. He died  July, 1707.    The tune of \"Majesty\" by William Billings will be noticed in a later  chapter.      TALLIS' EVENING HYMN.        Glory to Thee, my God, this night      For all the blessings of the light,      Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,      Under Thine own Almighty wings.    This stanza begins the second of Bp. Ken's three beautiful hymn-prayers  in his _Manual_ mentioned on a previous page.      _THE TUNE._    For more than three hundred and fifty years devout people have enjoyed"]]]
