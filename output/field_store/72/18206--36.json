Kossuth, however, was enabled by the more liberal of his  colleagues to publish the reports on his own account. He then extended  the journal by the insertion of leading articles; and his counsels and  criticisms on the instructions of the _comitats_ to the deputies, so  stirred the bile and counteracted the views of the Austrian authorities,  that they interfered and suspended his newspaper by seizing his presses.  But, even this did not stop his pen, nor those of his many amanuenses;  until, at last, Metternich, exasperated by his obstinacy, caused him to  be seized and condemned to three years' imprisonment in the citadel of  Ofen. He was liberated in 1837; and during the years that elapsed  between that epoch and 1848 the history of Hungary was that of Kossuth,  who, amidst the many men of noble birth, wealth, high character, and  singular talents, who surrounded him, still held his ground, and shone  pre-eminent. In 1847 he was the acknowledged leader of the  constitutional party, and member for the Hungarian capital. It is  unnecessary to pursue this narrative. The events of 1848 and 1849 have  passed too recently and vividly before us to need relation. The part  that Kossuth played in those years was but the logical consequence of  his previous life. The struggle was for the rights of Hungary, in all  circumstances and against all foes. For these he fought along with the  Hungarian aristocracy, as long as they had the courage to resist  Austria; and when they wavered, he went on without them, appealing to  the _comitats_ and to the smaller landed proprietors in the absence of  the greater, and to the squires instead of the nobles.    [Illustration: THE WIFE AND CHILDREN OF KOSSUTH--FROM A RECENT  DAGUERREOTYPE.]    The result thus far we all know. The final result perhaps we in America  are to decide.          THE ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF GREECE.      [Illustration: THE ACROPOLIS.]    Every one can understand the regret with which we behold the remains of  ancient grandeur, and the capitals of buried empires. This feeling, so  profound in Jerusalem and Rome, is even more so in Athens,--            \"the eye of Greece, mother of arts      And eloquence, native to famous wits,      Or hospitable--\"    a city never so large as New-York, but whose inhabitants produced within  the short space of two centuries, reckoning from the battle of Marathon,  as Landor says, a larger number of exquisite models, in war, philosophy,  patriotism, oratory and poetry--in the semi-mechanical arts which  accompany or follow them, sculpture and painting--and in the first of  the mechanical, _architecture_, than the remainder of Europe in six  thousand years.    The monuments of antiquity which still exist in Athens have been  described by Chandler, Clarke, Gell, Stuart, Dodwell, Leake, and other  travellers, the most recent and competent of whom perhaps is Mr. Henry  Cook, of London, author of _Illustrations of a Tour in the Ionian  Islands, Greece, and Constantinople_, who has just made, or rather is  now making for the _Art-Journal_ a series of drawings of those which are  most important, representing them in their present condition. These  drawings by Mr. Cook, so far as they have appeared, we reproduce in the  _International_, making liberal use at the same time of his  descriptions.    Until the sacrilegious hand of the late Lord Elgin despoiled Athens of  \"what Goth, and Turk, and Time had spared,\" the world could still see  enough to render possible a just impression of her old and chaste  magnificence. It is painful to reflect within how comparatively short a  period the chief injuries have been inflicted on such buildings as the  Parthenon, and the temple of Jupiter Olympus, and to remember how recent  is the greater part of the rubbish by which these edifices have been  choked up, mutilated, and concealed. Probably until within a very few  centuries, time had been, simply and alone, the \"beautifier of the  dead,\" \"adorner of the ruin,\" and, but for the vandalism of a few  barbarians, we might have gazed on the remains of former greatness  without an emotion except of admiration for the genius by which they  were created. The salient feature (probably the only one) in the present  rule at Athens is one which affords the highest satisfaction to those  interested in this subject. Slowly, indeed, and with an absence of all  energy, is going on the restoration of some, the disinterment of others,  and the conservation of all the existing monuments; and time will  probably ere long give us back, so far as is possible, all that the  vandalism or recklessness of modern ages has obscured or destroyed. On  the Acropolis the results of these efforts at restoration are chiefly  visible; day by day the debris of ruined fortifications, of Turkish  batteries, mosques, and magazines, are disappearing; every thing which  is not Pentelic marble finds its way over the steep sides of the  fortress, and in due time nothing will be left but the scattered  fragments which really belonged to the ancient temples. \"The above  sketch,\" says Mr. Cook, \"represents faithfully the present condition of  this most sublime creation. The details of the partial destruction of  this old fortress--founded 1556 years before the advent of the  Saviour--under the fire of the Venetians, commanded by Morosini, are so  well known, that I have thought it unnecessary to repeat them; but it  is impossible to recall them without a shudder, as the reflection is  forced on one, of what must have been their fate whose wickedness caused  an explosion which could scatter, as a horse's hoof may the sands of the  sea-shore, the giant masses which for ever bear witness to the power of  that mighty agent we have evoked from the earth for our mutual  destruction.\" At the west end of the Acropolis, by which alone it was  accessible, stood the Propylaea, its gate as well as its defence. Through  this gate the periodical processions of the Panathenaic jubilee were  wont to move, and the marks of chariot wheels are still visible on the  stone floor of its entrance. It was of the Doric order, and its right  wing was supported by six fluted columns, each five feet in diameter,  twenty-nine in height, and seven in their intercolumniation. Of the  Propylaea itself Mr. Cook gives no individual drawing, the only sketch he  had opportunity of making, being in its relation to the Acropolis  generally; \"it will, however,\" he says, \"serve in some degree to show  what has been done. Here perhaps the chief work has been accomplished;  all the now detached columns were built up with solid brickwork,  batteries were erected on the spot occupied by the Temple of 'Victory  without wings,' and on the square which answered to it on the opposite  side of the flight of marble steps; the whole of which were deeply  buried (not until they had severely suffered), beneath the ruins of the  fortification which crumbled away under the Venetian guns. These walls  have been removed, the batteries destroyed, and the material of which  they were composed taken away; the steps exhumed, and the five grand  entrances, by which the fortress was originally entered, opened,  although not yet rendered passable. It would be, I imagine, impossible  to conceive an approach more magnificent than this must have been. The  whole is on such a superb scale, the design, in its union of simplicity  and grandeur is so perfect, the material so exquisite, and the view  which one has from it of the Parthenon and the Erechtheum so beautiful,  that no interest less intense than that which belongs to these temples  would be sufficient to entice the stranger from its contemplation.\"    [Illustration: THE PARTHENON.]    On the right wing of the Propylaea stood the temple of Victory, and on  the left was a building decorated with paintings by the pencil of  Polygnotus, of which Pausanias has left us an account. In a part of the  wall still remaining there are fragments of excellent designs in  basso-relievo, representing the combat of the Athenians with the  Amazons; besides six columns, white as snow, and of the finest  architecture. Near the Propylaea stood the celebrated colossal statue of  Minerva, executed by Phidias after the battle of Marathon, the height of  which, including the pedestal, was sixty feet.    The chief glory of the Acropolis was the Parthenon, or temple of  Minerva. It was a peripteral octostyle, of the Doric order, with  seventeen columns on the sides, each six feet two inches in diameter at  the base, and thirty-four feet in height, elevated on three steps. Its  height, from the base of the pediments, was sixty-five feet, and the  dimensions of the area two hundred and thirty-three feet, by one hundred  and two. The eastern pediment was adorned with two groups of statues,  one of which represented the birth of Minerva, the other the contest of  Minerva with Neptune for the government of Athens. On the metopes was  sculptured the battle of the Centaurs with the Lapithae; and the frieze  contained a representation of the Panathenaic festivals. Ictinus,  Callicrates, and Carpion, were the architects of this temple; Phidias  was the artist; and its entire cost has been estimated at seven million  and a half of dollars. Of this building, eight columns of the eastern  front and several of the lateral colonnades are still standing. Of the  frontispiece, which represented the contest of Neptune and Minerva,  nothing remains but the head of a sea-horse and the figures of two  women without heads. The combat of the Centaurs and Lapithae is in better  preservation; but of the numerous statues with which this temple was  enriched, that of Adrian alone remains. The Parthenon, however,  dilapidated as it is, still retains an air of inexpressible grandeur "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2096"],[0,"A Smaller History of Greece: from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest (#4)"],[1,"fe.  To have  his name proclaimed as victor before assembled Hellas was an object of  ambition with the noblest and the wealthiest of the Greeks.  Such a  person was considered to have conferred everlasting glory upon his  family and his country, and was rewarded by his fellow-citizens with  distinguished honours.    During the sixth century before the Christian era three other national  festivals--the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games--which were at first  only local became open to the whole nation. The Pythian games were  celebrated in every third Olympic year, on the Cirrhaean plain in  Phocis, under the superintendence of the Amphictyons.  The games  consisted not only of matches in gymnastics and of horse and chariot  races, but also of contests in music and poetry.  They soon acquired  celebrity, and became second only to the great Olympic festival.  The  Nemean and Isthmian games occurred more frequently than the Olympic and  Pythian.  They were celebrated once in two years--the Nemean in the  valley of Nemea between Phlius and Cleonae--and the Isthmian by the  Corinthians, on their isthmus, in honour of Poseidon (Neptune).  As in  the Pythian festival, contests in music and in poetry, as well as  gymnastics and chariot-races, formed part of these games.  Although the  four great festivals of which we have been speaking had no influence in  promoting the political union of Greece, they nevertheless were of  great importance in making the various sections of the race feel that  they were all members of one family, and in cementing them together by  common sympathies and the enjoyment of common pleasures.  The frequent  occurrence of these festivals, for one was celebrated every gear,  tended to the same result.    The Greeks were thus annually reminded of their common origin, and of  the great distinction which existed between them and barbarians.  Nor  must we forget the incidental advantages which attended them.  The  concourse of so large a number of persons from every part of the  Grecian world afforded to the merchant opportunities for traffic, and  to the artist and the literary man the best means of making their works  known.  During the time of the games a busy commerce was carried on;  and in a spacious hall appropriated for the purpose, the poets,  philosophers, and historians were accustomed to read their most recent  works.    The habit of consulting the same oracles in order to ascertain the will  of the gods was another bond of union.  It was the universal practice  of the Greeks to undertake no matter of importance without first asking  the advice of the gods; and there were many sacred spots in which the  gods were always ready to give an answer to pious worshippers.  The  oracle of Apollo at Delphi surpassed all the rest in importance, and  was regarded with veneration in every part of the Grecian world.  In  the centre of the temple of Delphi there was a small opening in the  ground, from which it was said that a certain gas or vapour ascended.  Whenever the oracle was to be consulted, a virgin priestess called  PYTHIA took her seat upon a tripod which was placed over the chasm.  The ascending vapour affected her brain, and the words which she  uttered in this excited condition were believed to be the answer of  Apollo to his worshippers.  They were always in hexameter verse, and  were reverently taken down by the attendant priests.  Most of the  answers were equivocal or obscure; but the credit of the oracle  continued unimpaired long after the downfall of Grecian independence.    A further element of union among the Greeks was the similarity of  manners and character.  It is true the difference in this respect  between the polished inhabitants of Athens and the rude mountaineers of  Acarnania was marked and striking; but if we compare the two with  foreign contemporaries, the contrast between them and the latter is  still more striking.  Absolute despotism human sacrifices, polygamy,  deliberate mutilation of the person as a punishment, and selling of  children into slavery, existed in some part or other of the barbarian  world, but are not found in any city of Greece in the historical times.    The elements of union of which we have been speaking only bound the  Greeks together in common feelings and sentiments:  they never produced  any political union.  The independent sovereignty of each city was a  fundamental notion in the Greek mind.  This strongly rooted feeling  deserves particular notice.  Careless readers of history are tempted to  suppose that the territory of Greece was divided among comparatively  small number of independent states, such as Attica, Arcadia, Boeotia,  Phocis, Locris, and the like; but this is a most serious mistake, and  leads to a total misapprehension of Greek history.  Every separate city  was usually an independent state, and consequently each of the  territories described under the general names of Arcadia, Boeotia,  Phocis, and Locris, contained numerous political communities  independent of one another.  Attica, it is true, formed a single state,  and its different towns recognised Athens as their capital and the  source of supreme power; but this is an exception to the general rule.        CHAPTER IV.    EARLY HISTORY OF PELOPONNESUS AND SPARTA, DOWN TO THE END OF THE  MESSENIAN WARS, B.C. 668.    In the heroic age Peloponnesus was occupied by tribes of Dorian  conquerors.  They had no share in the glories of the Heroic age; their  name does not occur in the Iliad, and they are only once mentioned in  the Odyssey; but they were destined to form in historical times one of  the most important elements of the Greek nation.  Issuing from their  mountain district between Thessaly, Locris and Phocis, they overran the  greater part of Peloponnesus, destroyed the ancient Achaean monarchies  and expelled or reduced to subjection the original inhabitants of the  land, of which they became the undisputed masters.  This brief  statement contains all that we know for certain respecting this  celebrated event, which the ancient writers placed eighty years after  the Trojan war (B.C. 1104).  The legendary account of the conquest of  Peloponnesus ran as follows:--The Dorians were led by the Heraclidae,  or descendants of the mighty hero Hercules.  Hence this migration is  called the Return of the Heraclidae.  The children of Hercules had long  been fugitives upon the face of the earth.  They had made many attempts  to regain possession of the dominions in the Peloponnesus, of which  their great sire had been deprived by Eurystheus, but hitherto without  success.  In their last attempt Hyllus, the son of Hercules, had  perished in single combat with Echemus of Tegea; and the Heraclidae had  become bound by a solemn compact to renounce their enterprise for a  hundred years.  This period had now expired; and the great-grandsons of  Hyllus--Temenus, Cresphontes, and Aristodemus--resolved to make a fresh  attempt to recover their birthright.  They were assisted in the  enterprise by the Dorians.  This people espoused their cause in  consequence of the aid which Hercules himself had rendered to the  Dorian king, AEgimius, when the latter was hard pressed in a contest  with the Lapithae.  The invaders were warned by an oracle not to enter  Peloponnesus by the Isthmus of Corinth, but across the mouth of the  Corinthian gulf.  The inhabitants of the northern coast of the gulf  were favourable to their enterprise. Oxylus, king of the AEtolians,  became their guide; and from Naupactus they crossed over to  Peloponnesus.  A single battle decided the contest.  Tisamenus, the son  of Orestes, was defeated and retired with a portion of his Achaean  subjects to the northern coast of Peloponnesus, then occupied by the  Ionians. He expelled the Ionians, and took possession of the country,  which continued henceforth to be inhabited by the Achaeans, and to be  called after them.  The Ionians withdrew to Attica, and the greater  part of them afterwards emigrated to Asia Minor.    The Heraclidae and the Dorians now divided between them the dominions  of Tisamenus and of the other Achaean princes.  The kingdom of Elis was  given to Oxylus as a recompense for his services as their guide; and it  was agreed that Temenus, Cresphontes, and Eurysthenes and Procles, the  infant sons of Aristodemus (who had died at Naupactus), should draw  lots for Argos, Sparta, and Messenia.  Argos fell to Temenus, Sparta to  Eurysthenes and Procles, and Messenia to Cresphontes.    Such are the main features of the legend of the Return of the  Heraclidae.  In order to make the story more striking and impressive,  it compresses into a single epoch events which probably occupied  several generations.  It is in itself improbable that the brave  Achaeans quietly submitted to the Dorian invaders after a momentary  struggle.  We have, moreover, many indications that such was not the  fact, and that it was only gradually and after a long protracted  contest that the Dorians became undisputed masters of the greater part  of Peloponnesus.    Argos was originally the chief Dorian state in Peloponnesus, but at the  time of the first Olympiad its power had been supplanted by that of  Sparta.  The progress of Sparta from the second to the first place  among the states in the peninsula was mainly owing to the military  discipline and rigorous training of its citizens. The singular  constitution of Sparta was unanimously ascribed by the ancients to the  legislator Lycurgus, but there were different stories respecting his  date, birth, travels, legislation, and death.  His most probable date  however is B.C. 776, in which year he is said to have assisted Iphitus  in restoring the Olympic games.  He was the son of Eunomus, one of the  two kings who reigned together in Sparta.  On the death of his father,  his elder brother, Polydectes, succeeded to the crown, but died soon  afterwards, leaving his queen with child."]]]
