In order that the experiment may be successful, the whole  apparatus should be carefully protected from the light, and allowed to  stand for several hours. This power of movement, as well as the power  to take in solid food, are eminently animal characteristics, though  the former is common to many plants as well.    After a longer or shorter time the mass of protoplasm contracts and  gathers into little heaps, each of which develops into a structure  that has no resemblance to any animal, but would be at once placed  with plants. In one common form (_Trichia_) these are round or  pear-shaped bodies of a yellow color, and about as big as a pin head  (Fig. 5, _D_), occurring in groups on rotten logs in damp woods.  Others are stalked (_Arcyria_, _Stemonitis_) (Fig. 5, _J_, _K_), and  of various colors,--red, brown, etc. The outer part of the structure  is a more or less firm wall, which breaks when ripe, discharging a  powdery mass, mixed in most forms with very fine fibres.      When strongly magnified the fine dust is found to be made up of    innumerable small cells with thick walls, marked with ridges or    processes which differ much in different species. The fibres also    differ much in different genera. Sometimes they are simple,    hair-like threads; in others they are hollow tubes with spiral    thickenings, often very regularly placed, running around their    walls.      The spores may sometimes be made to germinate by placing them in a    drop of water, and allowing them to remain in a warm place for about    twenty-four hours. If the experiment has been successful, at the end    of this time the spore membrane will have burst, and the contents    escaped in the form of a naked mass of protoplasm (Zooespore) with a    nucleus, and often showing a vacuole (Fig. 5, _v_), that    alternately becomes much distended, and then disappears entirely. On    first escaping it is usually provided with a long, whip-like    filament of protoplasm, which is in active movement, and by means of    which the cell swims actively through the water (Fig. 5, _I_ i).    Sometimes such a cell will be seen to divide into two, the process    taking but a short time, so that the numbers of these cells under    favorable conditions may become very large. After a time the lash is    withdrawn, and the cell assumes much the form of a small amoeba (_I_    ii).    The succeeding stages are difficult to follow. After repeatedly  dividing, a large number of these amoeba-like cells run together,  coalescing when they come in contact, and forming a mass of protoplasm  that grows, and finally assumes the form from which it started.      Of the common forms of slime moulds the species of _Trichia_ (Figs.    _D_, _I_) and _Physarum_ are, perhaps, the best for studying the    germination, as the spores are larger than in most other forms, and    germinate more readily. The experiment is apt to be most successful    if the spores are sown in a drop of water in which has been infused    some vegetable matter, such as a bit of rotten wood, boiling    thoroughly to kill all germs. A drop of this fluid should be placed    on a perfectly clean cover glass, which it is well to pass once or    twice through a flame, and the spores transferred to this drop with    a needle previously heated. By these precautions foreign germs will    be avoided, which otherwise may interfere seriously with the growth    of the young slime moulds. After sowing the spores in the drop of    culture fluid, the whole should be inverted over a so-called \"moist    chamber.\" This is simply a square of thick blotting paper, in which    an opening is cut small enough to be entirely covered by the cover    glass, but large enough so that the drop in the centre of the cover    glass will not touch the sides of the chamber, but will hang    suspended clear in it. The blotting paper should be soaked    thoroughly in pure water (distilled water is preferable), and then    placed on a slide, covering carefully with the cover glass with the    suspended drop of fluid containing the spores. The whole should be    kept under cover so as to prevent loss of water by evaporation. By    this method the spores may be examined conveniently without    disturbing them, and the whole may be kept as long as desired, so    long as the blotting paper is kept wet, so as to prevent the    suspended drop from drying up.      CLASS II.--_Schizophytes_.    The Schizophytes are very small plants, though not infrequently  occurring in masses of considerable size. They are among the commonest  of all plants, and are found everywhere. They multiply almost entirely  by simple transverse division, or splitting of the cells, whence their  name. There are two pretty well-marked orders,--the blue-green slimes  (_Cyanophyceae_) and the bacteria (_Schizomycetes_). They are  distinguished, primarily, by the first (with a very few exceptions)  containing chlorophyll (leaf-green), which is entirely absent from  nearly all of the latter.    The blue-green slimes: These are, with few exceptions, green plants of  simple structure, but possessing, in addition to the ordinary green  pigment (chlorophyll, or leaf-green), another coloring matter, soluble  in water, and usually blue in color, though sometimes yellowish or  red.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Blue-green slime (_Oscillaria_). _A_, mass of  filaments of the natural size. _B_, single filament, x 300. _C_, a  piece of a filament that has become separated. _s_, sheath, x 300.]    As a representative of the group, we will select one of the commonest  forms (_Oscillaria_), known sometimes as green slime, from forming a  dark blue-green or blackish slimy coat over the mud at the bottom of  stagnant or sluggish water, in watering troughs, on damp rocks, or  even on moist earth. A search in the places mentioned can hardly fail  to secure plenty of specimens for study. If a bit of the slimy mass is  transferred to a china dish, or placed with considerable water on a  piece of stiff paper, after a short time the edge of the mass will  show numerous extremely fine filaments of a dark blue-green color,  radiating in all directions from the mass (Fig. 6, _a_). The filaments  are the individual plants, and possess considerable power of motion,  as is shown by letting the mass remain undisturbed for a day or two,  at the end of which time they will have formed a thin film over the  surface of the vessel in which they are kept; and the radiating  arrangement of the filaments can then be plainly seen.    If the mass is allowed to dry on the paper, it often leaves a bright  blue stain, due to the blue pigment in the cells of the filament. This  blue color can also be extracted by pulverizing a quantity of the  dried plants, and pouring water over them, the water soon becoming  tinged with a decided blue. If now the water containing the blue  pigment is filtered, and the residue treated with alcohol, the latter  will extract the chlorophyll, becoming colored of a yellow-green.      The microscope shows that the filaments of which the mass is    composed (Fig. 6, _B_) are single rows of short cylindrical cells of    uniform diameter, except at the end of the filament, where they    usually become somewhat smaller, so that the tip is more or less    distinctly pointed. The protoplasm of the cells has a few small    granules scattered through it, and is colored uniformly of a pale    blue-green. No nucleus can be seen.      If the filament is broken, there may generally be detected a    delicate, colorless sheath that surrounds it, and extends beyond the    end cells (Fig. 6, _c_). The filament increases in length by the    individual cells undergoing division, this always taking place at    right angles to the axis of the filament. New filaments are produced    simply by the older ones breaking into a number of pieces, each of    which rapidly grows to full size.    The name \"oscillaria\" arises from the peculiar oscillating or swinging  movements that the plant exhibits. The most marked movement is a  swaying from side to side, combined with a rotary motion of the free  ends of the filaments, which are often twisted together like the  strands of a rope. If the filaments are entirely free, they may often  be observed to move forward with a slow, creeping movement. Just how  these movements are caused is still a matter of controversy.    The lowest of the _Cyanophyceae_ are strictly single-celled, separating  as soon as formed, but cohering usually in masses or colonies by means  of a thick mucilaginous substance that surrounds them (Fig. 7, _D_).    The higher ones are filaments, in which there may be considerable  differentiation. These often occur in masses of considerable size,  forming jelly-like lumps, which may be soft or quite firm (Fig. 7,  _A_, _B_). They are sometimes found on damp ground, but more commonly  attached to plants, stones, etc., in water. The masses vary in color  from light brown to deep blackish green, and in size from that of a  pin head to several centimetres in diameter.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Forms of _Cyanophyceae_. _A_, _Nostoc_. _B_,  _Gloeotrichia_, x 1. _C_, individual of _Gloeotrichia_. _D_,  Chrooecoccus. _E_, _Nostoc_. _F_, Oscillaria. _G_, _H_, _Tolypothrix_.  All x 300. _y_, heterocyst. _sp._ spore.]    In the higher forms special cells called heterocysts are found. They  are colorless, or light yellowish, regularly disposed; but their  function is not known. Besides these, certain cells become  thick-walled, and form resting cells (spores) for the propagation of  the plant (Fig. 7, C. _sp._). In species where the sheath of the  filament is well marked (Fig. 7, _H_), groups of cells slip out of the  sheath, and develop a new one, thus giving rise to a new plant.

Receive, &c.,    (Signed) BULOW.              No. 4.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir Stratford Canning_.    Sir,                              _Foreign Office, October_ 4, 1843.    The barbarous execution of the Armenian, recorded in your  Excellency's despatch of the 27th of August, has excited the  attention and interest of Her Majesty's Government in an unusual  degree; and they highly approve the line of conduct which you  pursued in reference to it.    Her Majesty's Government had hoped that the time had passed away  when the perpetration of such acts of atrocity could have been  tolerated; and that the law by which they are permitted or enjoined,  although it might still disgrace the Mahomedan code, had fallen so  completely into disuse as to have become virtually null and of no  effect.    It is, therefore, with the most painful feelings, that Her Majesty's  Government have seen so cruel a law brought so injudiciously again  into operation; and they consider every Christian Government not  only justified, but imperatively called upon to raise their voices  against such proceedings, whether the law be executed to the  prejudice of their own subjects, or of the Christian community in  general.    Her Majesty's Government confidently trust that no repetition of so  unjustifiable an act as that against which your Excellency so  properly remonstrated will ever be suffered, and still less  authorized by the Turkish Government; and they earnestly counsel  that Government to take immediate measures for effectually  preventing the future commission of such atrocities.    Under the full conviction that the Sultan will have the humanity and  wisdom to listen to this counsel, which is given with the most  friendly feeling, and which will, I doubt not, be equally impressed  on His Highness by other Christian Governments, I do not think it  necessary to enter further at present into the other points set  forth in your Excellency's despatch above referred to.    You will not fall to communicate this despatch to Rifaat Pasha.    I am, &c.,    (Signed) ABERDEEN.              No. 5.      _The Earl of Westmorland to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  October_ 30.)    My Lord,                          _Berlin, October_ 23, 1843.    I have communicated to Baron Bülow your Lordship's despatch of the  4th instant to Sir Stratford Canning relative to the late execution  of an Armenian at Constantinople, and his Excellency has requested  me to express the interest with which he had learnt your Lordship's  views on that subject.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) WESTMORLAND.              No. 6.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  November_ 2.)    My Lord,                          _Buyukderé, October_ 11, 1843.    The Prussian Minister has communicated to me an instruction  addressed to him by Baron Bülow in reply to his representations on  the subject of the Armenian youth, whose execution and its natural  consequences were brought under your Lordship's notice in my  despatch of August the 27th.        The French Minister has also communicated to me a note, transmitted  to him from Paris for presentation to the Porte, with reference to  the same deplorable act of the Turkish Government.    Copies of these two papers have not been given to me; but I  understand that the Prussian instruction has been sent to your  Lordship, and it is probable that the same degree of confidence has  been shewn to your Lordship by M. Guizot. I have only to remark that  the terms in which these documents are respectively expressed,  appear to me highly creditable to the Cabinets from which they have  issued, and, should your Lordship see fit to instruct me in a  similar sense, it would afford me great satisfaction to repeat to  the Turkish Minister, with the immediate authority of Her Majesty's  Government, what I ventured at the time to intimate by anticipation  on my own suggestion. Baron Bülow and M. Guizot appear to be equally  impressed with the dangerous character of that policy to which the  Armenian execution is traceable, and their reprobation of the act  itself is proportionally strong. Baron de Bourqueney is prepared to  give in his note without waiting for the concurrence of his  colleagues. M. Le Coq is instructed to act simultaneously with the  other Representatives of the Five Powers.    With respect to the Austrian and Russian Ministers, I am informed by  M. de Titow that the Emperor of Russia's absence from St.  Petersburgh has prevented his receiving an immediate answer to his  despatches; and I hear that the Internuncio refers to a  communication made by Prince Metternich to the Turkish Ambassador at  Vienna as sufficiently expressive of the sentiments of his Court and  superseding the necessity of any step on his part without further  instructions.    I would venture humbly to submit that a concurrent expression of the  sentiments of the Five Courts on such an occasion would hardly fail  of producing a most beneficial effect upon the counsels of the  Porte.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.              No. 7.      _The Earl of Aberdeen to Sir Stratford Canning_.    (Extract.)                   _Foreign Office, November_ 4, 1843.    I have received your despatch of the 11th of October, reporting that  the French and Prussian Ministers had received instructions from  their respective Governments on the subject of the execution of the  Armenian referred to in your despatch of the 27th of August.    I calculate that your Excellency will have received on the 24th  ultimo my despatch of the 4th, by which your Excellency will have  been enabled to acquaint the Porte with the feelings with which Her  Majesty's Government had received the intelligence of that  melancholy transaction. I have nothing to add to that instruction.              No. 8.      _Sir Stratford Canning to the Earl of Aberdeen_.--(_Received  November_ 23.)    My Lord,                          _Buyukdéré, October_ 31, 1843.    The instruction which I have received from your Lordship respecting  the Armenian decapitated for returning to the Christian faith,  cannot fail of making a deep and, I hope, a salutary impression upon  the Ottoman Ministers.    I have had it carefully translated into Turkish, and placed in M.  Pisani's hands for communication to the Porte, accompanied with an  instruction of which I have the honour to inclose a copy herewith.    Monsieur de Bourqueney having been directed to present an official  note upon the same subject, I thought it advisable to give a certain  degree of formality to the communication of your Lordship's  despatch, and particularly to leave it with the Minister for Foreign  Affairs in writing. A copy of the French Minister's note is herewith  inclosed.    The presentation of this remonstrance has strongly excited the  public attention, and occasioned no small embarrassment at the  Porte. It was proposed in Council to return it, but the suggestion  was overruled, and I hear that nothing will be added to the verbal  reply already given.    The substance of that reply, which M. de Bourqueney read to me from  the report of his first interpreter, is by no means unfavourable.  The language employed by Rifaat Pasha in speaking of the French  Minister's note to M. Pisani, admitted, in substance, that much  might be said with reason against the manner and circumstances of  the execution, but as to the act itself, he said that nothing could  be alleged against a judgment founded upon the express will of God.  His answer to the communication of your Lordship's instruction has  not yet reached me. It will have the greater interest as two more  cases of religion involving capital punishment have recently  occurred. The offender in each instance is a native Mussulman; and  nothing, I conceive, but the late expression of indignation has  prevented the Porte from executing the sentence of the law.    I am informed that Rifaat Pasha, on consulting the Grand Mufti as to  one of these cases, was advised not to bring it under His Holiness'  notice as he had no choice but to declare the law; and a charitable  intimation was added, that where a State necessity existed, the  Porte would herself be found the most competent judge.    The Russian Minister informs me that he is still in expectation of  instructions from St. Petersburgh. The Internuncio refers to the  remarks addressed by Prince Metternich himself to the Turkish  Ambassador at Vienna. M. de Le Coq reserves the communication of his  instruction, in the hope of being able to act simultaneously with M.  de Titow. The silence of any one of the leading Courts on such an  occasion would be a cause of just regret.    I have, &c.,    (Signed) STRATFORD CANNING.    Inclosure l in No 8.    _Baron de Bourqueney to Rifaat Pasha_.                                      _Thérapia_, 17 _Octobre_, 1843.    Le Soussigné, Ministre Plénipotentiaire de Sa Majesté le Roi des  Français près la Porte Ottomane, a reçu de son Gouvernement l'ordre  de faire à son Excellence le Ministre des Affaires Etrangères la  communication suivante.

En vain pour expliquer un acte aussi déplorable voudrait-on se  prévaloir des dispositions impérieuses de la législation. On devait  croire que la législation faite pour d'autres temps était tombée en  désuétude; et en tout cas il était trop facile de fermer les yeux  sur un pareil fait pour qu'on puisse considérer ce qui vient  d'arriver comme une de ces déplorables nécessités dans lesquelles la  politique trouve quelquefois non pas une"]]]
