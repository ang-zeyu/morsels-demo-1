With regard to commerce with Spain, we have to lament the same  indifference on the part of the Americans. I have, for instance, an  American double-burner petroleum lamp. All who see it admire and covet  it, but they are not to be had here. If we except one American in  Madrid, who brings mostly pumps and similar articles on a very small  scale, we have no dealers in American goods here. Wooden clothes pins,  lemon squeezers, clothes horses, potato peelers, and the hundreds of  domestic appliances of American invention, elsewhere considered  indispensable, are in Spain unknown.    We had confidently expected that the new Spanish law on patents would  draw the attention of American inventors toward this country, that  to-day offers a wide field for every new practical invention, but I am  sorry to see that, with the exception of Edison and a few others, the  Americans have not yet availed themselves of the easy facility for  taking patents for Spain, where new inventions and new industries are  now eagerly accepted and adopted. And while the Americans are thus  careless as to their own interests, the French take out and negotiate,  in Spain, American patents with insignificant variations.    Let American inventors be assured that any new invention, useful and  practical, and above all, requiring but little capital to establish it  as an industry, will find a ready sale in Spain.    I could enlarge to a much greater extent upon the indifference of  American inventors, merchants, manufacturers, and business men, as to  the market they have in Spain in their respective lines, and upon the  importance of building up a trade with this country, but to do so  would require more space than I think you would feel justified in  occupying in your columns.           *       *       *       *       *          PETER COOPER AS AN INVENTOR.      The successes of Peter Cooper's long and useful life are well known.  Not so many are aware of his varied experience in the direction of  failure, particularly in the field of invention. More than once he has  found his best devices profitless because ahead of his time, or  because of conditions, political or otherwise, which no one could  foresee. He possessed the rare qualities, however, of pluck and  perseverance, and when one thing failed he lost no time in trying  something else. Before he was of age he had learned three trades--and  he did not make his fortune at either.    In a familiar conversation with a _Herald_ writer recently, Mr. Cooper  related some of his early experiences, particularly with reference to  enterprises which did not succeed. His father was a hatter, and as a  boy young Cooper learned how to make a hat in all its parts. The  father was not successful in business, and the hatter's trade seems to  have offered little encouragement to the son. Accordingly he learned  the art of making ale. Why he did not stick to that calling and become  a millionaire brewer, Mr. Cooper does not say. Most probably the  national taste for stronger tipple could not at that time be overcome,  and ale could not compete with New England rum and apple-jack. The  young mechanic next essayed the art of coachmaking, at which he served  a full apprenticeship. At the end of his time his employer offered to  set him up in business, but the offer was not accepted, through fear  of losing another's money. He felt that if he took the money and lost  it he would have to be a slave for life. So he quit coachmaking and  went to work for a man at Hempstead, L. I., making machines for  shearing cloth. In three years, on $1.50 a day, Cooper had saved  enough money to buy his employer's patent. Immediately he introduced  improvements in the manufacture and in the machine, which the war with  England made a great demand for by excluding foreign cloths. At this  time Cooper married. In due time the family numbered three, and the  young father's inventive faculty was again called upon.    \"In those days,\" said Mr. Cooper to the reporter, smiling as the  remembrance came to his mind, \"we kept no servants as they do  nowadays, and my wife and myself had to do all that was to be done.  After our first child was born I used to come into the house and find  my wife rocking the cradle, and I relieved her from that while I was  there. After doing that for a few days I thought to myself that I  could make that thing go of itself. So I went into my shop, and made a  pendulous cradle that would rock the child. Then I attached a musical  instrument which would sing for it, and at the same time the machine  would keep the flies off. The latter was very simple; by hanging  something to the cross bar, as the cradle swung under it, backward and  forward, it would create wind enough to drive away the flies. The  machine was wound up by a weight, and would run for nearly half an  hour without stopping. I took out a patent for it, and one day a  peddler came along with a horse and wagon, as they do in the country,  and saw the cradle. He struck a bargain with me and bought the patent  right for the State of Connecticut, giving for it his horse and wagon  and all the goods he had with him. They afterward made some there, but  nothing like as good as mine. It was a beautiful piece of furniture,\"  said Mr. Cooper regretfully, as he thought of it as a thing of the  past. \"They afterward substituted springs for the weight movement, but  that kind was not so good.\"    About this time the war with England ended and the market was spoiled  for the shearing machines. Then, we believe, Mr. Cooper tried his hand  at cabinetmaking, but that failed, and he set up a grocery store where  the Bible House now stands. While selling groceries Mr. Cooper made an  invention which ought to have made his fortune, but it did not. The  story is best told in Mr. Cooper's own words:    \"It was just before the Erie Canal was completed, and I conceived a  plan by which to tow boats by the use of all the elevated waters on  the line of the canal. To demonstrate that that was practicable I made  with my own hands a chain two miles long, and placed posts 200 feet  apart in the East River from Bellevue dock down town about a mile.  These posts supported grooved wheels to lay the chain in, forming an  endless chain. The whole was moved by an overshot waterwheel placed at  the Bellevue dock. A reservoir twelve feet square and three deep held  the water to turn the wheel.\"    At the suggestion of Governor Clinton Mr. Cooper tightened his chain  and pulled up the end post just before the grand trial of his device  was to come off. He succeeded in getting stone enough to anchor the  post, however, and the experiment went off swimmingly. The boat was  hooked on to the chain, and the passage back and forward--two  miles--was made in eleven minutes.    \"I ran that boat some ten days,\" says Mr. Cooper, \"to let people see  what could be done, and carried nearly a thousand people. Part of the  time I ran two boats. Once I counted 52 people in one boat. I made the  whole chain myself and planted the posts. As I could find no wheels to  suit me I made the moulds and cast the wheels myself out of block tin  and zinc. It was no small job, I can tell you.\"    This was unquestionably a grand invention. In itself it was a perfect  success; but it was not used. Mr. Cooper tells why:    \"It demonstrated completely that the elevated water power along the  line of the canal and every lock in the canal could be made use of to  drive the boats. Governor Clinton gave me $800 for the privilege of  buying the right to the plan in case he should want to use it on the  Erie Canal. In making the canal he had promised the people along the  route that as soon as it was finished they could sell their horses to  tow the boats, their grain and fodder to feed the horses, and their  provisions for the passengers. On reflection he thought that if he  took all that away from them he would have to run the gantlet again,  and he could not afford to do that. There never was anything done with  the plan until a few years ago, when Mr. Welch, president of the  Camden and Amboy Railroad and Canal, invented exactly the same thing  and put it in practice on his locks on the canal. He found it saved  half the time and great expense. He went to Washington to take out a  patent for it, and when he got there he found that I had patented the  same thing fifty-three years before. My patent had run out, so he  could use the plan on his canal. It has also been used on one lock on  the Erie Canal. If they could have used that chain on the whole length  of the Erie Canal it would have saved many millions of dollars.\"    This would not be a bad place, were there room for it, to speak of  \"undeveloped\" and therefore worthless inventions; and the assumption  that if an inventor does not make his invention immediately profitable  it must be good for nothing, and should be dispatented. But the moral  goes without telling.    Mr. Cooper's next attempt at invention was made about the same time,  but in quite a different direction. It was during the struggle of the  Greeks for independence, and wishing to do something for their  assistance, Mr. Cooper undertook to make a torpedo boat for them. Mr.  Cooper says:    \"It was a small one that could be taken on board ship and used to  destroy any vessel that came to destroy them. It was fixed with a  rotary steam engine and a screw wheel to propel it. It was intended to  be guided from the ship or the shore. There were two steel wires fixed  to the tiller of the rudder, and the operator could pull on one side  or the other and guide the vessel just as a horse is guided with  reins. It was so arranged that at night it would carry a light with  its dark side toward the object to be destroyed, and by simply keeping  the light in range with the vessel it would be sure to hit it.

Evolution in society has not been from  militancy to industrialism, but from organization based on kinship to  organization based on property, and alongside of the specializations of  the industries of peace the arts of war have been specialized.    So, one by one, the theories of metaphysical writers on sociology are  overthrown, and the facts of history are taking their place, and the  philosophy of history is being erected out of materials accumulating by  objective studies of mankind      PSYCHOLOGY.    Psychology has hitherto been chiefly in the hands of subjective  philosophers and is the last branch of anthropology to be treated by  scientific methods. But of late years sundry important labors have been  performed with the end in view to give this department of philosophy a  basis of objective facts; especially the organ of the mind has been  studied and the mental operations of animals have been compared with  those of men, and in various other ways the subject is receiving  scientific attention.    The new psychology in process of construction will have a threefold  basis: A physical basis on phenomena presented by the organ of the mind  as shown in man and the lower animals; a linguistic basis as presented  in the phenomena of language, which is the instrument of mind; a  functional basis as exhibited in operations of the mind.    The phenomena of the third class may be arranged in three subclasses.  First, the operations of mind exhibited in individuals in various stages  of growth, various degrees of culture, and in various conditions, normal  and abnormal; second, the operations of mind as exhibited in technology,  arts, and industries; third, the operations of mind as exhibited in  philosophy; and these are the explanations given of the phenomena of the  universe. On such a basis a scientific psychology must be erected.           *       *       *       *       *    As methods of study are discovered, a vast field opens to the American  scholar. Now, as at all times in the history of civilization, there has  been no lack of interest in this subject, and no lack of speculative  writers; but there is a great want of trained observers and acute  investigators.    If we lay aside the mass of worthless matter which has been published,  and consider only the material used by the most careful writers, we find  on every hand that conclusions are vitiated by a multitude of errors of  fact of a character the most simple. Yesterday I read an article on the  \"Growth of Sculpture,\" by Grant Allen, that was charming; yet, therein I  found this statement:         So far as I know, the Polynesians and many other savages have not       progressed beyond the full-face stage of human portraiture above       described. Next in rank comes the drawing of a profile, as we find       it among the Eskimos and the bushmen. Our own children soon attain       to this level, which is one degree higher than that of the full       face, as it implies a special point of view, suppresses half the       features, and is not diagrammatic or symbolical of all the separate       parts. Negroes and North American Indians cannot understand       profile; they ask what has become of the other eye.    Perhaps Mr. Allen derives his idea of the inability of the Indians to  understand profiles from a statement of Catlin, which I have seen used  for this and other purposes by different anthropologists until it seems  to have become a _favorite fact_.    Turning to Catlin's _Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and  Condition of the North American Indians_, (vol. 2, page 2) we find him  saying:         After I had painted these, and many more whom I have not time at       present to name, I painted the portrait of a celebrated warrior of       the Sioux, by the name of Mah-to-chee-ga (the Little Bear), who was       unfortunately slain in a few moments after the picture was done by       one of his own tribe; and which was very near costing me my life,       for having painted a side view of his face, leaving one-half of it       out of the picture, which had been the cause of the affray; and,       supposed by the whole tribe to have been intentionally left out by       me, as \"good for nothing.\" This was the last picture that I painted       amongst the Sioux, and the last, undoubtedly, that I shall ever       paint in that place. So tremendous and so alarming was the       excitement about it that my brushes were instantly put away, and I       embarked the next day on the steamer for the sources of the       Missouri, and was glad to get underweigh.    Subsequently, Mr. Catlin elaborates this incident into the \"Story of the  Dog\" (vol. 2, page 188 _et seq_).    Now, whatsoever of truth or of fancy there may be in this story, it  cannot be used as evidence that the Indians could not understand or  interpret profile pictures, for Mr. Catlin himself gives several plates  of Indian pictographs exhibiting profile faces. In my cabinet of  pictographs I have hundreds of side views made by Indians of the same  tribe of which Mr. Catlin was speaking.    It should never be forgotten that accounts of travelers and other  persons who write for the sake of making good stories must be used with  the utmost caution. Catlin is only one of a thousand such who can be  used with safety only by persons so thoroughly acquainted with the  subject that they are able to divide facts actually observed from  creations of fancy. But Mr. Catlin must not be held responsible for  illogical deductions even from his facts. I know not how Mr. Allen  arrived at his conclusion, but I do know that pictographs in profile are  found among very many, if not all, the tribes of North America.    Now, for another example. Peschel, in _The Races of Man_ (page 151),  says:         The transatlantic history of Spain has no case comparable in       iniquity to the act of the Portuguese in Brazil, who deposited the       clothes of scarlet-fever or small-pox patients on the hunting       grounds of the natives, in order to spread the pestilence among       them; and of the North Americans, who used strychnine to poison the       wells which the Redskins were in the habit of visiting in the       deserts of Utah; of the wives of Australian settlers, who, in times       of famine, mixed arsenic with the meal which they gave to starving       natives.    In a foot-note on the same page, Burton is given as authority for the  statement that the people of the United States poisoned the wells of the  redskins.    Referring to Burton, in _The City of the Saints_ (page 474), we find him  saying:         The Yuta claim, like the Shoshonee, descent from an ancient people       that immigrated into their present seats from the Northwest. During       the last thirty years they have considerably decreased, according       to the mountaineers, and have been demoralized mentally and       physically by the emigrants. Formerly they were friendly, now they       are often at war with the intruders. As in Australia, arsenic and       corrosive sublimate in springs and provisions have diminished their       number.    Now, why did Burton make this statement? In the same volume he describes  the Mountain Meadow massacre, and gives the story as related by the  actors therein. It is well known that the men who were engaged in this  affair tried to shield themselves by diligently publishing that it was a  massacre by Indians incensed at the travelers because they had poisoned  certain springs at which the Indians were wont to obtain their supplies  of water. When Mr. Burton was in Salt Lake City he, doubtless, heard  these stories.    So the falsehoods of a murderer, told to hide his crime, have gone into  history as facts characteristic of the people of the United States in  their treatment of the Indians. In the paragraph quoted from Burton some  other errors occur. The Utes and Shoshonis do not claim to have  descended from an ancient people that immigrated into their present  seats from the Northwest. Most of these tribes, perhaps all, have myths  of their creation in the very regions now inhabited by them.    Again, these Indians have not been demoralized mentally or physically by  the emigrants, but have made great progress toward civilization.    The whole account of the Utes and Shoshonis given in this portion of the  book is so mixed with error as to be valueless, and bears intrinsic  evidence of having been derived from ignorant frontiersmen.    Turning now to the first volume of Spencer's _Principles of Sociology_  (page 149), we find him saying:         And thus prepared, we need feel no surprise on being told that the       Zuni Indians require \"much facial contortion and bodily       gesticulation to make their sentences perfectly intelligible;\" that       the language of the Bushman needs so many signs to eke out its       meaning, that \"they are unintelligible in the dark;\" and that the       Arapahos \"can hardly converse with one another in the dark.\"    When people of different languages meet, especially if they speak  languages of different stocks, a means of communication is rapidly  established between them, composed partly of signs and partly of oral  words, the latter taken from one or both of the languages, but curiously  modified so as hardly to be recognized. Such conventional languages are  usually called \"jargons,\" and their existence is rather brief.    When people communicate with each other in this manner, oral speech is  greatly assisted by sign-language, and it is true that darkness impedes  their communication. The great body of frontiersmen in America who  associate more or less with the Indians depend upon jargon methods of  communication with them; and so we find that various writers and  travelers describe Indian tongues by the characteristics of this jargon"]]]
