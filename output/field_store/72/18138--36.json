Rebner had led him to  expect always the best among the Germans. Were they not the most  advanced of humans? Were they not the patterns whom he should model  himself after in the laudatory desire for self-improvement? He was  naturally curious to see the young lady of the household, all the  more as he wondered how she would blend into this blunt picture. She  did not appear and he heard no reference to her. But there was a  vacant place.    Much struggling occurred over the mutual endeavors to carry on  conversation. With the English which the sons had learned and with  Gard's German which he found a strange article on its native ground,  headway was made after a fashion. His bloodless American college  variety of the language was very weak to buffet about in these  billows of idioms and colloquialisms.    The family, in its emphatic substantiality, was most friendly and  eager to please. They urged food and fluid upon him in a way that  would have dismayed his Yankee doctor. He found himself eating and  drinking to an extent he had never imagined. This sort of thing, he  concluded half-despairingly, would either be the making of him or  kill him. At home the general fear was about too much. Here satiety,  over-satiety, seemed to be the rule as at all German firesides.  While he dreaded to think what his abstemious digestive apparatus  would do, his new friends took not amiss the bountiful spilling of  edibles and liquids upon their napkins spread conspicuously over  their breasts. Laundering must be cheap in Germany. That was one  good thing.    Gard did not forget that this was represented to be a highly  instructed and cultivated circle. The members had graduated from the  best schools or held degrees from standard universities. He kept  asking himself in what guises the much advertised German excellence  was yet to appear in this domestic group whose culture and virtues  had been so extolled. If these manners and habits were part of its  perfect ripened fruit, then American education and life were indeed  obviously blighted. He could not help noticing that all hands had  not been necessarily washed before meal-time, and that finger nails  were unblushingly uncleaned and unkempt. An accidental glimpse under  the immense flowing white beard of his host revealed the absence of  a shirt collar, and the neck evidently relied on its untrimmed  hairiness as an excuse for not being customarily washed.    It became apparent to Kirtley after a month that personal cleanness  and neatness in Germany were not particularly considered as next to  godliness. The gold braid, spick and span uniforms and other showy  gear, were apt to cover dirty bodies and soiled underwear. Alas, the  Germans could not wash in beer. He wondered why his old enthusiastic  mentor had never given him a hint of these things. Likely he did not  know. Distance often increases eloquence in proportion as it breeds  ignorance.    With the exhilaration of the bounteous meal, however, Gard's spirits  rose to a height he had not known in a long time. If conversation  languished over the stony roads of the duality of expression,  glasses were clinked together again and a new topic was hopefully  started. When it seemed proper to him that the end of the repast  should be in sight, a new course would be brought in, usually  accompanied boisterously by the two family dogs, including the  ferocious beast who had given Gard the shivers. The animals  conducted themselves with a ravenous freedom around the board,  alternately being petted and fed and allowed to lick plates, only to  be in turn kicked out and shrieked after, with a chair occasionally  upset in the rumpus. This habit of kicking animals, things and  persons Gard later observed was prevalent among the Teutons, whose  appropriate fondness for conveniently big boots and large stout  shoes at the same time discourages any vanity about small feet. It  is a part of their military predilection.    At the end of a couple of hours dinner was brought to a close.  Fraeulein had not yet put in an appearance, and it now came out that  she was \"at lesson.\" She must have stayed for another class. After  his gastronomic feat Gard did not know whether he felt sick or never  better in his life. What's more, he did not seem to care, his senses  were so pleasantly numbed.    On his way up to his room, in the dim hall, he caught sight of a  young woman hanging up her wrap. Mussed strands of straw-colored  hair shone down her shoulders and sent a sudden thrill of gladness  through his veins. He had never seen but one Wagner opera and that  was \"The Twilight of the Gods,\" with its aureate Rhine maidens  bathing in that delicious revelry of divine music. The arrival at  last of the daughter of the house, as he assumed this was, brought  back a flash of all that golden loveliness.    In his sleep that first night, vast trenchers of food and tankards  of drink disported in happy confusion with goddesses blond and  magical.          CHAPTER V    FAMILY LIFE      The matter of much eating and drinking had first to be, if possible,  disposed of. It was exacting and the most important affair. Kirtley  did not want to be discourteous or appear unappreciative. He had  come to Germany to do as the superior Germans do. His digestive  tract was on the narrow-gage American plan. Theirs was broad-gage,  with their surpassing organisms.    At the Buchers Gard had manfully to face six meals a day. Must he be  swamped in order to put the desirable adipose tissue on his bones?  By all the laws of American dieting and Prohibition the German race  should have been destroyed by indigestion and drunkenness centuries  ago. But here they were more flourishing than ever--the generally  acknowledged nation of masters!    And his bed--the German bed. He could not remember whether Mark  Twain ever described it, but he should have. Gard's haven of rest  appeared to lie on solid foundations. It was constructed with German  stability. There were as many blankets in summer as in winter.    Worst of all, two immense feather pillows lay across its middle. The  only place for them seemed to be on his sorely tried stomach or on  the floor. In a month an attack of insomnia resulted. For hours at  night he lay awake, listening to the frequent rain on the roof or  the wind whining Teutonically in the leaves of his linden.    In his initial troubles and anxieties he went to a German doctor.  This spectacled wise man prescribed more beer. German physicians  seemed to be in league with the brewers. Gard was of the kind who  would suffer rather than complain. So he worried along.    He did not fall in with the urgent, conscientious assumption of  the Buchers that he would at once want to begin driving away at  \"lessons.\" His hosts reminded him openly at times that his  prospective teachers were still waiting, still recommending  themselves. Responsibility was evidently felt for his programme  of work. He realized that he was somewhat disappointing, for  instruction, education, is such a pushing, unceasing business  with the Germans. It may be said they never finish school.    Yet he wished first to take a good look at the historic city, its  celebrated art treasures. He wanted to make a few excursions in the  environs before the winter set in with its dampness and gloom.  Besides, he never before had had a chance at fine opera, at fine  symphonies and music recitals.    \"But ought not Herr Kirtley at least begin with the free evening  lectures?\"--with which Dresden shone through the illuminations of  many profound and oracular professors in lofty pulpits. He submitted  that his German was too feeble of wing to enable him to soar into  the heights of such wisdom.    The zest in Germany for learning and accomplishments was truly  wonderful to him. Half his life of instruction now quickly seemed to  have been idling. As far as industriousness, drilling, well-defined  ambitiousness, were concerned, the young German had many advantages.    The modest Bucher household was run educationally with the dynamic  regularity of military establishments. It was, of course, no  exception. Lessons and lectures commenced mornings at eight, with  Sundays partly included. This routine begins with the German child  at six.    Evenings, too, had their busy duties. No baseball, no tennis, no  lazy days of swimming and fishing. Playtime was spent in martial  exercise, in evenings at the opera or seeing the classical dramas of  all races and epochs on the stage. Gard became aware that the Bucher  children had carried six or seven studies at an age when he had  thought he was abused, overburdened, with four.    Besides, their courses were more mature. And yet he had come to  Germany, despite Rebner's eulogiums of the Germans, with the  complacent idea that, as he was the respectable American average,  he could look the other youth of the world in the face unashamed,  asking no odds.    Little Ernst at fifteen was studying, among numerous things,  philosophy and didactic religion. The way he could cite facts  and carry on a discussion on these and similar subjects!    \"What part do philosophy and religion play in our system of  instruction for the young?\" Gard asked himself with a deprecatory  smile. \"Is it a miracle that the Germans can teach us desirable  knowledge and morals, as Rebner insists?\"    Kirtley readily perceived that he had scarcely sufficient precise  information to discuss intelligently general topics with this boy.  The latter could always quote some acknowledged and ponderous  authority--German, of course, and all the more awe-inspiring, but of  whom Gard had not heard. For it usually came down to the question,  Who are your authorities? He rarely could tell who his were. They  promptly faded away before all the weight and definiteness Ernst  could bring to bear.    While Rudolph and Ernst "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1995"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 1, Hell (#4)"],[1,"without repose that, coming on against me, little by little was  pushing me back thither where the Sun is silent.    [1] According to old tradition the spring was the season of the  creation.    [2] These three beasts correspond to the triple division of sins  into those of incontinence, of violence, and of fraud. See Canto  XI.      While I was falling back to the low place, before mine eyes  appeared one who through long silence seemed hoarse. When I saw  him in the great desert, \"Have pity on me!\" I cried to him,  \"whatso thou art, or shade or real man.\" He answered me: \"Not  man; man once I was, and my parents were Lombards, and Mantuans  by country both. I was born sub Julio, though late, and I lived  at Rome under the good Augustus, in the time of the false and  lying gods. Poet was I, and sang of that just son of Anchises who  came from Troy after proud Ilion had been burned. But thou, why  returnest thou to so great annoy? Why dost thou not ascend the  delectable mountain which is the source and cause of every joy?\"    \"Art thou then that Virgil and that fount which poureth forth so  large a stream of speech?\" replied I to him with bashful front:  \"O honor and light of the other poem I may the long seal avail  me, and the great love, which have made me search thy volume!  Thou art my master and my author; thou alone art he from whom I  took the fair style that hath done me honor. Behold the beast  because of which I turned; help me against her, famous sage, for  she makes any veins and pulses tremble.\" \"Thee it behoves to hold  another course,\" he replied, when he saw me weeping, \"if thou  wishest to escape from this savage place; for this beast, because  of which thou criest out, lets not any one pass along her way,  but so hinders him that she kills him! and she has a nature so  malign and evil that she never sates her greedy will, and after  food is hungrier than before. Many are the animals with which she  wives, and there shall be more yet, till the hound [1] shall come  that will make her die of grief. He shall not feed on land or  goods, but wisdom and love and valor, and his birthplace shall be  between Feltro and Feltro. Of that humble[2] Italy shall he be the  salvation, for which the virgin Camilla died, and Euryalus, Turnus  and Nisus of their wounds. He shall hunt her through every town  till he shall have set her back in hell, there whence envy first  sent her forth. Wherefore I think and deem it for thy best that  thou follow me, and I will be thy guide, and will lead thee hence  through the eternal place where thou shalt hear the despairing  shrieks, shalt see the ancient spirits woeful who each proclaim  the second death. And then thou shalt see those who are contented  in the fire, because they hope to come, whenever it may be, to the  blessed folk; to whom if thou wilt thereafter ascend, then shall be  a soul more worthy than I for that. With her I will leave thee at  my departure; for that Emperor who reigneth them above, because I  was rebellious to His law, wills not that into His city any one  should come through me. In all parts He governs and them He reigns:  there in His city and His lofty seat. O happy he whom thereto He  elects!\" And I to him, \"Poet, I beseech thee by that God whom thou  didst not know, in order that I may escape this ill and worse, that  thou lead me thither whom thou now hast said, so that I may see the  gate of St. Peter, and those whom thou makest so afflicted.\"      [1] Of whom the hound is the symbol, and to whom Dante looked for  the deliverance of Italy from the discorda and misrule that made  her wretched, is still matter of doubt, after centuries of  controversy.      [2] Fallen, humiliated.      Then he moved on, and I behind him kept.        CANTO II. Dante, doubtful of his own powers, is discouraged at  the outset.--Virgil cheers him by telling him that he has been  sent to his aid by a blessed Spirit from Heaven.--Dante casts off  fear, and the poets proceed.    The day was going, and the dusky air was taking the living things  that are on earth from their fatigues, and I alone was preparing  to sustain the war alike of the road, and of the woe which the  mind that erreth not shall retrace. O Muses, O lofty genius, now  assist me! O mind that didst inscribe that which I saw, here  shall thy nobility appear! I began:--\"Poet, that guidest me,  consider my virtue, if it is sufficient, ere to the deep pass  thou trustest me. Thou sayest that the parent of Silvius while  still corruptible went to the immortal world and was there in the  body. Wherefore if the Adversary of every ill was then courteous,  thinking on the high effect that should proceed from him, and on  the Who and the What,[1] it seemeth not unmeet to the man of  understanding; for in the empyreal heaven he had been chosen for  father of revered Rome and of her empire; both which (to say  truth indeed) were ordained for the holy place where the  successor of the greater Peter hath his seat. Through this going,  whereof thou givest him vaunt, he learned things which were the  cause of his victory and of the papal mantle. Afterward the  Chosen Vessel went thither to bring thence comfort to that faith  which is the beginning of the way of salvation. But I, why go I  thither? or who concedes it? I am not Aeneas, I am not Paul; me  worthy of this, neither I nor others think; wherefore if I give  myself up to go, I fear lest the going may be mad. Thou art wise,  thou understandest better than I speak.\"    [1] Who he was, and what should result.      And as is he who unwills what he willed, and because of new  thoughts changes his design, so that he quite withdraws from  beginning, such I became on that dark hillside: wherefore in my  thought I abandoned the enterprise which had been so hasty in the  beginning.    \"If I have rightly understood thy speech,\" replied that shade of  the magnanimous one, \"thy soul is hurt by cowardice, which  oftentimes encumbereth a man so that it turns him back from  honorable enterprise, as false seeing does a beast when it is  startled. In order that thou loose thee from this fear I will  tell thee wherefore I have come, and what I heard at the first  moment that I grieved for thee. I was among those who are  suspended,[1] and a Lady called me, so blessed and beautiful that  I besought her to command. Her eyes were more lucent than the  star, and she began to speak to me sweet and low, with angelic  voice, in her own tongue: 'O courteous Mantuan soul, of whom the  fame yet lasteth in the world, and shall last so long as the  world endureth! a friend of mine and not of fortune upon the  desert hillside is so hindered on his road that he has turned for  fear, and I am afraid, through that which I have heard of him in  heaven, lest already he be so astray that I may have risen late  to his succor. Now do thou move, and with thy speech ornate, and  with whatever is needful for his deliverance, assist him so that  I may be consoled for him. I am Beatrice who make thee go. I come  from a place whither I desire to return. Love moved me, and makes  me speak. When I shall be before my Lord, I will commend thee  often unto Him.' Then she was silent, and thereon I began: 'O  Lady of Virtue, thou alone through whom the human race surpasseth  all contained within that heaven which hath the smallest circles!  [2] so pleasing unto me is thy command that to obey it, were it  already done, were slow to me. Thou hast no need further to  open unto me thy will; but tell me the cause why thou guardest  not thyself from descending down here into this centre, from the  ample place whither thou burnest to return.' 'Since thou wishest  to know so inwardly, I will tell thee briefly,' she replied to  me, 'wherefore I fear not to come here within. One ought to fear  those things only that have power of doing harm, the others not,  for they are not dreadful. I am made by God, thanks be to Him,  such that your misery toucheth me not, nor doth the flame of this  burning assail me. A gentle Lady[3] is in heaven who hath pity  for this hindrance whereto I send thee, so that stern judgment  there above she breaketh. She summoned Lucia in her request, and  said, \"Thy faithful one now hath need of thee, and unto thee I  commend him.\" Lucia, the foe of every cruel one, rose and came to  the place where I was, seated with the ancient Rachel. She said,  \"Beatrice, true praise of God, why dost thou not succor him who  so loved thee that for thee he came forth from the vulgar throng?  Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint? Dost thou not see the  death that combats him beside the stream whereof the sea hath no  vaunt?\" In the world never were persons swift to seek their good,  and to fly their harm, as I, after these words were uttered, came  here below, from my blessed seat, putting my trust in thy upright  speech, which honors thee and them who have heard it.' After she  had said this to me, weeping she turned her lucent eyes, whereby  she made me more speedy in coming. And I came to thee as she  willed. Thee have I delivered from that wild beast that took from  thee the short ascent of the beautiful mountain. What is it then?  Why, why dost thou hold back? why dost thou harbor such cowardice  in thy heart? why hast thou not daring and boldness, since three  blessed Ladies care for thee in the court of Heaven, and my  speech pledges thee such good?\"    [1] In Limbo, neither in Hell nor Heaven.

As flowerets, bent and closed by the chill of night, after the  sun shines on them straighten themselves all open on their stem,  so I became with my weak virtue, and such good daring hastened to  my heart that I began like one enfranchised: \"Oh compassionate  she who succored me! and thou courteous who didst speedily obey  the true words that she addressed to thee! Thou by thy words hast  so disposed my heart with desire"]]]
