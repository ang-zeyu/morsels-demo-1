[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20496"],[0,"Legends of the Rhine (#4)"],[1," Rine.\" King Gunther receives the fair Recken  into his service as a vassal.    Siegfried, exhibiting the fairest loyalty to his overlord, and  rendered invisible by magic, conquers for him the redoubtable  Brunhild, the proud queen of the island kingdom of Isenland (Iceland)  and compels her to wed King Gunther. As a reward Siegfried receives  the hand of Chriemhild. In the fulness of his heart the hero presents  to Chriemhild as a marriage gift, the Nibelungen Hoard, which he had  gained in his early years from the sons of the king of the Nibelungen  and from Dwarf Alberich the guardian of the treasure.    Joy reigns in the king's court at Worms, but it was not shared by all.  Besides Chriemhild there was another secretly drawn towards the hero,  and in Brunhild's heart the bridal happiness of Chriemhild awakens  such envy that soon no friendly word passes between the women. They  become estranged and one day her bad feeling leads Brunhild to harsh  words. Then alas, Chriemhild gave unbridled licence to her tongue. In  her rash insolence she represents to Brunhild that it was not Gunther  but Siegfried who formerly overcame her. As proof of this she produces  the ring and girdle which Siegfried had taken on that night from the  powerful Brunhild, and which he had presented to Chriemhild. With  fierce haughtiness Chriemhild taunts her opponent with a hateful name  no woman could endure, and forbids her to enter the cathedral.    Brunhild, weeping, informs King Gunther of the contumely heaped upon  her. The king is filled with wrath, and his vassal, the gloomy Hagen,  considers how he may destroy Siegfried avowedly to avenge the Queen,  but secretly for the possession of the Nibelungen Hoard. During a hunt  in the Odenwald Siegfried was treacherously stabbed by Hagen whilst  stopping to drink from a well. The intention was to spread the report  that Siegfried had been slain by robbers whilst hunting alone. So, on  the following day they crossed the Rhine back to Worms.    In the night Hagen caused the dead body of Siegfried to be laid in  front of Chriemhild's chamber. In the early morning as Chriemhild  accompanied by her attendants was preparing to go to mass in the  cathedral she noticed the corpse of her hero. A wail of sorrow arose.  Chriemhild threw herself weeping on the body of her murdered husband.  \"Alas!\" she cried \"thy shield is not hewn by swords: thou hast been  foully murdered. Did I but know who has done this, I would avenge thy  death.\" Chriemhild ordered a magnificent bier for her royal hero, and  demanded that an ordeal should be held over the corpse. \"For it is a  marvellous thing, and to this day it happens, that when the  bloodstained murderer approaches wounds bleed anew.\"    So all the princes and nobles of Burgundy walked past the dead body,  above which was the figure of the crucified Redeemer of the world, and  lo! when the grim Hagen came forward the wounds of the dead man began  to flow. In the presence of the astounded men and horrified women  Chriemhild accused Hagen of the assassination of her husband.    Much treachery and woe accompanied the expiation of this great crime.  The Nibelungen Hoard, the cause of the shameful deed, was sunk in the  middle of the Rhine in order to prevent future strife arising from  human greed. But Chriemhild's undying sorrow was not mitigated, nor  her unconquerable thirst for revenge appeased.    After the burial of his son King Siegmund begged in vain that  Chriemhild should come to the royal city of Xanten; she remained at  Worms for thirteen years constantly near her beloved dead.    Then the sorrowing woman removed to the Abbey of Lorch which her  mother, Frau Ute, had founded. Thither also, she transferred  Siegfried's body.    When Etzel (Attila) the ruler of the Huns wooed her, Chriemhild urged  not by love but by very different feelings gave him her hand and  accompanied her heathen lord to the Ungarland. Then she treacherously  invited Siegfried's murderers to visit her husband, and prepared for  them a destruction which fills the mind with horror. The Burgundian  king and his followers, who, since the Hoard had come into their  possession, were called the Nibelungen, fell slaughtered in the  Etzelburg under the swords of the Huns and their allies, thus atoning  for their faithlessness to the hero Siegfried. And with this awful  holocaust ends the Lied of the Nibelungen Not, the most renowned  heroic legend in the German tongue.          SPEYER    The Bells of Speyer      The German Emperor, Henry IV., had much trouble to bear under his  purple mantle. Through his own and through stranger's faults the crown  which he wore was set with thorns, and even into the bosom of his  family this unhappy spirit of dissension had crept. The  excommunication of the Pope, his powerful enemy, was followed by the  revolt of the princes, and lastly by the conspiracy of his own sons.  His eldest son, Conrad, openly rebelled against him, and treated his  father most scornfully. When this prince died suddenly, the second  son, Henry, attempted the deposition of his father and made intrigues  against him. Thus forced to abdicate his throne the broken-down  emperor fled to Liege, accompanied by one faithful servant, Kurt, and  there lay down to his last rest.    His body was left for five years in unconsecrated ground in a foreign  country. Kurt remained faithful, and prayed incessantly at the  burial-place of his royal master.    At last the Pope at Henry's request consented to recall the ban. Henry  ordered his father's remains to be brought to Speyer and solemnly  interred with the royal family. Kurt was allowed to follow the  procession to Speyer, but wearied out by this long watching the old  man died a few days afterwards. Just at the moment of his death the  bells in the cathedral at Speyer tolled without any human hand putting  them in motion, as they always did when an imperial death took place.    Years passed.    The German emperor Henry V. lay dying on his luxurious couch at  Speyer. His bodily sufferings were intense, but the agony of his mind  was even greater; he had obtained the crown which now pressed so  heavily on his head, by shameful treacherous means. The apparition of  his father dying in misery appeared to him, and no words of the  flatterers at his bed-side could still the voice of his conscience. At  last death freed him from all his torments, and at the same hour the  bells which were always rung when a poor sinner was led to execution,  tolled, set in motion by no human hand.    Thus were the bells the instrument of that Hand which wisely and  warningly wrote ... \"Honour thy father and thy mother....\"          FRANKFORT    The Knave of Bergen      [Illustration: Der Scharfrichter von Bergen--Nach einer Zeichnung von  Adolf Menzel--The Knave of Bergen--Le bourreau de Bergen]    The emperor was to be crowned at Frankfort, and great festivities were  to be given in the town in his honour, among them a masquerade, at  which knights and noble ladies rivalled each other in splendour. Joy  was depicted on every face at this great assembly, only one knight  among the many guests being noticeable for his gravity and restraint.  He wore black armour, and the feather waving above his visor was black  too. No one knew him or could guess who he was. He approached the  empress with a noble grace, bent his knee, and asked her to dance with  him, which she graciously consented to do. He glided gracefully  through the splendid halls with the queen of the festival, and soon  every eye was turned on them, and everyone was eager to know who he  was.    The empress was charmed with her excellent partner, and the grace of  his refined conversation pleased her so much that she granted him a  second and a third dance.    Everyone became more and more curious to know who this masked knight  was. Meanwhile the hour struck when every mask had to be raised, and  every masked guest must make himself known. More than all the others  the empress was anxious to know who her partner was. But he hesitated  and even refused to take off his mask until she ordered him  peremptorily to do so. The knight obeyed, but none of the high ladies  or noble knights recognised him. Suddenly two stewards pressed through  the crowd, crying out with indignation and horror;    \"It is the headsman from Bergen!\"    Then the emperor in great wrath ordered the shameful offender who had  thus degraded the empress and insulted his sovereign to be led to  execution.    But the culprit, throwing himself at the emperor's feet, said boldly,  \"I have transgressed, my lord, and offended you and your noble guests,  but most heavily have I sinned against my queen. No punishment, not  even blood, will be able to wash out the disgrace you have suffered  through me. Therefore, oh King! allow me to propose a remedy to efface  the shame. Draw your sword and knight me, and I will throw down my  gauntlet to any one who dares to speak disrespectfully of my  sovereign.\"    The emperor was taken by surprise at this bold proposal. However it  appeared the wisest plan to adopt.    \"You are a knave,\" he replied after a moment's consideration, \"but  your advice is good and displays prudence, just as your offence shows  adventurous courage. Well then,\"--laying his sword on the man's  neck--\"rise Sir Knight. You have acted like a knave, and the Knave of  Bergen you shall be called henceforth.\"    A joyful shout of approbation pealed through the halls, and the new  knight again glided gracefully through the crowd with the queen of the  festival.          MAYENCE    Heinrich Frauenlob      [Illustration: Heinrich Frauenlob--Steinbild im Dom zu Mainz]    The priest or as some say, canon, in the old town of Mayence was a  very worthy man, and at the same time a heaven-gifted singer.

Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep      And dreamt she heard them bleating:    But when she awoke she found it a joke,      For still they all were fleeting.      Then up she took her little crook,      Determined for to find them;    She found 'em indeed, but it made her heart bleed,      For they'd left their tails behind 'em.      It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray      Unto a meadow hard by,    There she espied their tails, side by side,      All hung on a tree to dry.
