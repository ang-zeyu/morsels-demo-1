[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#4)"],[1,"n, summoning the faithful to their morning prayer,  awakened me from the state of ecstasy into which I seemed to have fallen.  All the delights, all the ineffable glories, which the Almighty has  recounted in His Book as the priceless possessions of the people of  Paradise--these I seemed to be experiencing that night. Methinks I was in a  place of which it could be truly said: 'Therein no toil shall reach us,  and therein no weariness shall touch us;' 'no vain discourse shall they  hear therein, nor any falsehood, but only the cry, \"Peace! Peace!\"';  'their cry therein shall be, \"Glory to Thee, O God!\" and their salutation  therein, \"Peace!\", and the close of their cry, \"Praise be to God, Lord of  all creatures!\"' Sleep had departed from me that night. I was enthralled  by the music of that voice which rose and fell as He chanted; now swelling  forth as He revealed verses of the Qayyumu'l-Asma, again acquiring  ethereal, subtle harmonies as He uttered the prayers He was revealing. At  the end of each invocation, He would repeat this verse: 'Far from the  glory of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, be that which His creatures affirm of  Him! And peace be upon His Messengers! And praise be to God, the Lord of  all beings!'\"    \"This Revelation,\" Mulla Husayn has further testified, \"so suddenly and  impetuously thrust upon me, came as a thunderbolt which, for a time,  seemed to have benumbed my faculties. I was blinded by its dazzling  splendor and overwhelmed by its crushing force. Excitement, joy, awe, and  wonder stirred the depths of my soul. Predominant among these emotions was  a sense of gladness and strength which seemed to have transfigured me. How  feeble and impotent, how dejected and timid, I had felt previously! Then I  could neither write nor walk, so tremulous were my hands and feet. Now,  however, the knowledge of His Revelation had galvanized my being. I felt  possessed of such courage and power that were the world, all its peoples  and its potentates, to rise against me, I would, alone and undaunted,  withstand their onslaught. The universe seemed but a handful of dust in my  grasp. I seemed to be the voice of Gabriel personified, calling unto all  mankind: 'Awake, for, lo! the morning Light has broken. Arise, for His  Cause is made manifest. The portal of His grace is open wide; enter  therein, O peoples of the world! For He Who is your promised One is  come!'\"    A more significant light, however, is shed on this episode, marking the  Declaration of the Mission of the Bab, by the perusal of that \"first,  greatest and mightiest\" of all books in the Babi Dispensation, the  celebrated commentary on the Surih of Joseph, the first chapter of which,  we are assured, proceeded, in its entirety, in the course of that night of  nights from the pen of its divine Revealer. The description of this  episode by Mulla Husayn, as well as the opening pages of that Book attest  the magnitude and force of that weighty Declaration. A claim to be no less  than the mouthpiece of God Himself, promised by the Prophets of bygone  ages; the assertion that He was, at the same time, the Herald of One  immeasurably greater than Himself; the summons which He trumpeted forth to  the kings and princes of the earth; the dire warnings directed to the  Chief Magistrate of the realm, Muhammad _Sh_ah; the counsel imparted to  Haji Mirza Aqasi to fear God, and the peremptory command to abdicate his  authority as grand vizir of the _Sh_ah and submit to the One Who is the  \"Inheritor of the earth and all that is therein\"; the challenge issued to  the rulers of the world proclaiming the self-sufficiency of His Cause,  denouncing the vanity of their ephemeral power, and calling upon them to  \"lay aside, one and all, their dominion,\" and deliver His Message to  \"lands in both the East and the West\"--these constitute the dominant  features of that initial contact that marked the birth, and fixed the  date, of the inception of the most glorious era in the spiritual life of  mankind.    With this historic Declaration the dawn of an Age that signalizes the  consummation of all ages had broken. The first impulse of a momentous  Revelation had been communicated to the one \"but for whom,\" according to  the testimony of the Kitab-i-Iqan, \"God would not have been established  upon the seat of His mercy, nor ascended the throne of eternal glory.\" Not  until forty days had elapsed, however, did the enrollment of the seventeen  remaining Letters of the Living commence. Gradually, spontaneously, some  in sleep, others while awake, some through fasting and prayer, others  through dreams and visions, they discovered the Object of their quest, and  were enlisted under the banner of the new-born Faith. The last, but in  rank the first, of these Letters to be inscribed on the Preserved Tablet  was the erudite, the twenty-two year old Quddus, a direct descendant of  the Imam Hasan and the most esteemed disciple of Siyyid Kazim. Immediately  preceding him, a woman, the only one of her sex, who, unlike her  fellow-disciples, never attained the presence of the Bab, was invested  with the rank of apostleship in the new Dispensation. A poetess, less than  thirty years of age, of distinguished birth, of bewitching charm, of  captivating eloquence, indomitable in spirit, unorthodox in her views,  audacious in her acts, immortalized as Tahirih (the Pure One) by the  \"Tongue of Glory,\" and surnamed Qurratu'l-'Ayn (Solace of the Eyes) by  Siyyid Kazim, her teacher, she had, in consequence of the appearance of  the Bab to her in a dream, received the first intimation of a Cause which  was destined to exalt her to the fairest heights of fame, and on which  she, through her bold heroism, was to shed such imperishable luster.    These \"first Letters generated from the Primal Point,\" this \"company of  angels arrayed before God on the Day of His coming,\" these \"Repositories  of His Mystery,\" these \"Springs that have welled out from the Source of  His Revelation,\" these first companions who, in the words of the Persian  Bayan, \"enjoy nearest access to God,\" these \"Luminaries that have, from  everlasting, bowed down, and will everlastingly continue to bow down,  before the Celestial Throne,\" and lastly these \"elders\" mentioned in the  Book of Revelation as \"sitting before God on their seats,\" \"clothed in  white raiment\" and wearing on their heads \"crowns of gold\"--these were, ere  their dispersal, summoned to the Bab's presence, Who addressed to them His  parting words, entrusted to each a specific task, and assigned to some of  them as the proper field of their activities their native provinces. He  enjoined them to observe the utmost caution and moderation in their  behavior, unveiled the loftiness of their rank, and stressed the magnitude  of their responsibilities. He recalled the words addressed by Jesus to His  disciples, and emphasized the superlative greatness of the New Day. He  warned them lest by turning back they forfeit the Kingdom of God, and  assured them that if they did God's bidding, God would make them His heirs  and spiritual leaders among men. He hinted at the secret, and announced  the approach, of a still mightier Day, and bade them prepare themselves  for its advent. He called to remembrance the triumph of Abraham over  Nimrod, of Moses over Pharaoh, of Jesus over the Jewish people, and of  Muhammad over the tribes of Arabia, and asserted the inevitability and  ultimate ascendancy of His own Revelation. To the care of Mulla Husayn He  committed a mission, more specific in character and mightier in import. He  affirmed that His covenant with him had been established, cautioned him to  be forbearing with the divines he would encounter, directed him to proceed  to Tihran, and alluded, in the most glowing terms, to the as yet  unrevealed Mystery enshrined in that city--a Mystery that would, He  affirmed, transcend the light shed by both Hijaz and _Sh_iraz.    Galvanized into action by the mandate conferred upon them, launched on  their perilous and revolutionizing mission, these lesser luminaries who,  together with the Bab, constitute the First Vahid (Unity) of the  Dispensation of the Bayan, scattered far and wide through the provinces of  their native land, where, with matchless heroism, they resisted the savage  and concerted onslaught of the forces arrayed against them, and  immortalized their Faith by their own exploits and those of their  co-religionists, raising thereby a tumult that convulsed their country and  sent its echoes reverberating as far as the capitals of Western Europe.    It was not until, however, the Bab had received the eagerly anticipated  letter of Mulla Husayn, His trusted and beloved lieutenant, communicating  the joyful tidings of his interview with Baha'u'llah, that He decided to  undertake His long and arduous pilgrimage to the Tombs of His ancestors.  In the month of _Sh_a'ban, of the year 1260 A.H. (September, 1844) He Who,  both on His father's and mother's side, was of the seed of the illustrious  Fatimih, and Who was a descendant of the Imam Husayn, the most eminent  among the lawful successors of the Prophet of Islam, proceeded, in  fulfillment of Islamic traditions, to visit the Kaaba. He embarked from  Bu_sh_ihr on the 19th of Ramadan (October, 1844) on a sailing vessel,  accompanied by Quddus whom He was assiduously preparing for the assumption  of his future office. Landing at Jaddih after a stormy voyage of over a  month's duration, He donned the pilgrim's garb, mounted a camel, and set  out for Mecca, arriving on the first of _Dh_i'l-Hajjih (December 12).  Quddus, holding the bridle in his hands, accompanied his Master on foot to  that holy Shrine. On the day of Arafih, the Prophet-pilgrim of _Sh_iraz,  His chronicler relates, devoted His whole time to prayer. On the day of  Nahr He proceeded to Muna, where He sacrificed according to custom  nineteen lambs, nine in His own name, seven in the name of Quddus, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#4)"],[1,"day, who added, every day, to his certitude and faith, his luminous  quality, his ardent love. He made extraordinary progress during the few  days that he spent in the Most Great Prison. The point is that when his  carriage had come only part of the way from Haifa to Akka, one could  already perceive his spirit, his light.    After he had received the endless bounties showered on him by Baha'u'llah,  he was given leave to go, and he traveled to China. There, over a  considerable period, he spent his days mindful of God and in a manner  conformable to Divine good pleasure. Later he went on to India, where he  died.    The other revered Afnan and the friends in India felt it advisable to send  his blessed remains to 'Iraq, ostensibly to Najaf, to be buried near the  Holy City; for the Muslims had refused to let him lie in their graveyard,  and his body had been lodged in a temporary repository for safekeeping.  Aqa Siyyid Asadu'llah, who was in Bombay at the time, was deputized to  transport the remains with all due reverence to 'Iraq. There were hostile  Persians on the steamship and these people, once they reached Bu_sh_ihr,  reported that the coffin of Mirza Muhammad-'Ali the Babi was being carried  to Najaf for burial in the Vale of Peace, near the sacred precincts of the  Shrine, and that such a thing was intolerable. They tried to take his  blessed remains off the ship, but they failed; see what the hidden Divine  decrees can bring about.    His body came as far as Basra. And since that was a period when the  friends had to remain in concealment, Siyyid Asadu'llah was obliged to  proceed as if he were going on with the burial in Najaf, meanwhile hoping  in one way or another to effect the interment near Ba_gh_dad. Because,  although Najaf is a holy city and always shall be, still the friends had  chosen another place. God, therefore, stirred up our enemies to prevent  the Najaf burial. They swarmed in, attacking the quarantine station to lay  hold of the body and either bury it in Basra or throw it into the sea or  out on the desert sands.    The case took on such importance that in the end it proved impossible to  bring the remains to Najaf, and Siyyid Asadu'llah had to carry them on to  Ba_gh_dad. Here, too, there was no burial place where the Afnan's body  would be safe from molestation at enemy hands. Finally the Siyyid decided  to carry it to the shrine of Persia's Salman the Pure,(11) about five  farsa_kh_s out of Ba_gh_dad, and bury it in Ctesiphon, close to the grave  of Salman, beside the palace of the Sasaniyan kings. The body was taken  there and that trust of God was, with all reverence, laid down in a safe  resting-place by the palace of Naw_sh_iravan.    And this was destiny, that after a lapse of thirteen hundred years, from  the time when the throne city of Persia's ancient kings was trampled down,  and no trace of it was left, except for rubble and hills of sand, and the  very palace roof itself had cracked and split so that half of it toppled  to the ground--this edifice should win back the kingly pomp and splendor of  its former days. It is indeed a mighty arch. The width of its entry-way is  fifty-two paces and it towers very high.    Thus did God's grace and favor encompass the Persians of an age long gone,  in order that their ruined capital should be rebuilt and flourish once  again. To this end, with the help of God, events were brought about which  led to the Afnan's being buried here; and there is no doubt that a proud  city will rise up on this site. I wrote many letters about it, until at  last the holy dust could be laid to rest in this place. Siyyid Asadu'llah  would write me from Basra and I would answer him. One of the public  functionaries there was completely devoted to us, and I directed him to do  all he could. Siyyid Asadu'llah informed me from Ba_gh_dad that he was at  his wits' end, and had no idea where he could consign this body to the  grave. \"Wherever I might bury it,\" he wrote, \"they will dig it up again.\"    At last, praised be God, it was laid down in the very spot to which time  and again the Blessed Beauty had repaired; in that place honored by His  footsteps, where He had revealed Tablets, where the believers of Ba_gh_dad  had been in His company; that very place where the Most Great Name was  wont to stroll. How did this come about? It was due to the Afnan's purity  of heart. Lacking this, all those ways and means could never have been  brought to bear. Verily, God is the Mover of heaven and earth.    I loved the Afnan very much. Because of him, I rejoiced. I wrote a long  Visitation Tablet for him and sent it with other papers to Persia. His  burial site is one of the holy places where a magnificent  Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar must be raised up. If possible, the actual arch of  the royal palace should be restored and become the House of Worship. The  auxiliary buildings of the House of Worship should likewise be erected  there: the hospital, the schools and university, the elementary school,  the refuge for the poor and indigent; also the haven for orphans and the  helpless, and the travelers' hospice.    Gracious God! That royal edifice was once splendidly decked forth and  fair. But there are spiders' webs today, where hung the curtains of gold  brocade, and where the king's drums beat and his musicians played, the  only sound is the harsh cries of kites and crows. \"This is verily the  capital of the owl's realm, where thou wilt hear no sound, save only the  echo of his repeated calls.\" That is how the barracks were, when we came  to Akka. There were a few trees inside the walls, and on their branches,  as well as up on the battlements, the owls cried all night long. How  disquieting is the hoot of an owl; how it saddens the heart.    From earliest youth until he grew helpless and old, that sacred bough of  the Holy Tree, with his smiling face, shone out like a lamp in the midst  of all. Then he leapt and soared to undying glory, and plunged into the  ocean of light. Upon him be the breathings of his Lord, the All-Merciful.  Upon him, lapped in the waters of grace and forgiveness, be the mercy and  favor of God.            HAJI MIRZA HASAN, THE AFNAN      Among the most eminent of those who left their homeland to join  Baha'u'llah was Mirza Hasan, the great Afnan, who during the latter days  won the honor of emigrating and of receiving the favor and companionship  of his Lord. The Afnan, related to the Bab, was specifically named by the  Supreme Pen as an offshoot of the Holy Tree. When still a small child, he  received his portion of bounty from the Bab, and showed forth an  extraordinary attachment to that dazzling Beauty. Not yet adolescent, he  frequented the society of the learned, and began to study sciences and  arts. He reflected day and night on the most abstruse of spiritual  questions, and gazed in wonderment at the mighty signs of God as written  in the Book of Life. He became thoroughly versed even in such material  sciences as mathematics, geometry, and geography; in brief, he was well  grounded in many fields, thoroughly conversant with the thought of ancient  and modern times.    A merchant by profession, he spent only a short period of the day and  evening at his business, devoting most of his time to discussion and  research. He was truly erudite, a great credit to the Cause of God amongst  leading men of learning. With a few concise phrases, he could solve  perplexing questions. His speech was laconic, but in itself a kind of  miracle.    Although he first became a believer in the days of the Bab, it was during  the days of Baha'u'llah that he caught fire. Then his love of God burned  away every obstructing veil and idle thought. He did all he could to  spread the Faith of God, becoming known far and wide for his ardent love  of Baha'u'llah.    I am lost, O Love, possessed and dazed,  Love's fool am I, in all the earth.  They call me first among the crazed,  Though I once came first for wit and worth...    After the ascension of the Bab, he had the high honor of serving and  watching over the revered and saintly consort of the blessed Lord. He was  in Persia, mourning his separation from Baha'u'llah, when his  distinguished son became, by marriage, a member of the Holy Household. At  this, the Afnan rejoiced. He left Persia and hastened to the sheltering  favor of his Well-Beloved. He was a man amazing to behold, his face so  luminous that even those who were not believers used to say that a  heavenly light shone from his forehead.    He went away for a time and sojourned in Beirut, where he met the noted  scholar, _Kh_ajih Findik. This personage warmly praised the erudition of  the great Afnan in various circles, affirming that an individual of such  wide and diverse learning was rare throughout the East. Later on, the  Afnan returned to the Holy Land, settling near the Mansion of Bahji and  directing all his thoughts toward aspects of human culture. Much of the  time he would occupy himself with uncovering the secrets of the heavens,  contemplating in their detail the movements of the stars. He had a  telescope with which he would make his observations every night. He lived  a happy life, carefree and light of heart. In the neighborhood of  Baha'u'llah his days were blissful, his nights bright as the first morning  in spring.    But then came the Beloved's departure from this world. The Afnan's peace  was shattered, his joy was changed to grief. The Supreme Affliction was  upon us, separation consumed us, the once bright days turned black as  night, and all those roses of other hours were dust and rubble now. He  lived on for a little while, his heart smoldering, his eyes shedding their  tears. But he could not bear the longing for his Well-Beloved, and in a  little while his soul gave up this life and fled to the eternal one;  passed into the Heaven of abiding reunion and was immersed beneath an  ocean of light. Upon him be most"]]]
