Trees or shrubs, resinous; leaves simple, mostly evergreen, relatively  small, entire, needle-shaped, awl-shaped, linear, or scale-like;  stipules none; flowers catkin-like; calyx none; corolla none; ovary  represented by a scale (ovuliferous scale) bearing the naked ovules on  its surface.      ABIETACEAE.    LARIX. PINUS. PICEA. TSUGA. ABIES.    Buds scaly; leaves evergreen and persistent for several years (except in  _Larix_), scattered along the twigs, spirally arranged or tufted,  linear, needle-shaped, or scale-like; sterile and fertile flowers  separate upon the same plant; stamens (subtended by scales) spirally  arranged upon a central axis, each bearing two pollen-sacs surmounted by  a broad-toothed connective; fertile flowers composed of spirally  arranged bracts or cover-scales, each bract subtending an ovuliferous  scale; cover-scale and ovuliferous scale attached at their bases;  cover-scale usually remaining small, ovuliferous scale enlarging,  especially after fertilization, gradually becoming woody or leathery and  bearing two ovules at its base; cones maturing (except in _Pinus_) the  first year; ovuliferous scales in fruit usually known as cone-scales;  seeds winged; roots mostly spreading horizontally at a short distance  below the surface.      CUPRESSACEAE.    THUJA. CUPRESSUS. JUNIPERUS.    Leaf-buds not scaly; leaves evergreen and persistent for several years,  opposite, verticillate, or sometimes scattered, scale-like, often  needle-shaped in seedlings and sometimes upon the branches of older  plants; flowers minute; stamens and pistils in separate blossoms upon  the same plant or upon different plants; stamens usually bearing 3-5  pollen-sacs on the underside; scales of fertile aments few, opposite or  ternate; fruit small cones, or berries formed by coalescence of the  fleshy cone-scales; otherwise as in _Abietaceae_.      Larix Americana, Michx.    _Larix laricina, Koch._    TAMARACK. HACMATACK. LARCH. JUNIPER.    =Habitat and Range.=--Low lands, shaded hillsides, borders of ponds; in  New England preferring cold swamps; sometimes far up mountain slopes.         Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, west to the Rocky       mountains; from the Rockies through British Columbia, northward       along the Yukon and Mackenzie systems, to the limit of tree growth       beyond the Arctic circle.    Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont,--abundant, filling swamps acres in  extent, alone or associated with other trees, mostly black spruce;  growing depressed and scattered on Katahdin at an altitude of 4000 feet;  Massachusetts,--rather common, at least northward; Rhode Island,--not  reported; Connecticut,--occasional in the northern half of the state;  reported as far south as Danbury (Fairfield county).         South along the mountains to New Jersey and Pennsylvania; west to       Minnesota.    =Habit.=--The only New England conifer that drops its leaves in the  fall; a tree 30-70 feet high, reduced at great elevations to a height of  1-2 feet, or to a shrub; trunk 1-3 feet in diameter, straight, slender;  branches very irregular or in indistinct whorls, for the most part  nearly horizontal; often ending in long spire-like shoots; branchlets  numerous, head conical, symmetrical while the tree is young, especially  when growing in open swamps; when old extremely variable, occasionally  with contorted or drooping limbs; foliage pale green, turning to a dull  yellow in autumn.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk reddish or grayish brown, separating at the  surface into small roundish scales in old trees, in young trees smooth;  season's shoots gray or light brown in autumn.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds small, globular, reddish.    Leaves simple, scattered along the season's shoots, clustered on the  short, thick dwarf branches, about an inch long, pale green,  needle-shaped; apex obtuse; sessile.    =Inflorescence.=--March to April. Flowers lateral, solitary, erect; the  sterile from leafless, the fertile from leafy dwarf branches; sterile  roundish, sessile; anthers yellow: fertile oblong, short-stalked; bracts  crimson or red.    =Fruit.=--Cones upon dwarf branches, erect or inclining upwards, ovoid  to cylindrical, 1/2-3/4 of an inch long, purplish or reddish brown while  growing, light brown at maturity, persistent for at least a year; scales  thin, obtuse to truncate; edge entire, minutely toothed or erose; seeds  small, winged.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy in New England; grows in any good soil,  preferring moist locations; the formal outline of the young trees  becomes broken, irregular, and picturesque with age, making the mature  tree much more attractive than the European species common to  cultivation. Rarely for sale in nurseries, but obtainable from  collectors. To be successfully transplanted, it must be handled when  dormant. Propagated from seed.         =Note.=--The European species, with which the mature plant is often       confused, has somewhat longer leaves and larger cones; a form       common in cultivation has long, pendulous branches.

The leaves are of two kinds, primary and secondary; the primary are  thin, deciduous scales, in the axils of which the secondary leaf-buds  stand; the inner scales of those leaf-buds form a loose, deciduous  sheath which encloses the secondary or foliage leaves, which in our  species are all minutely serrulate.      Pinus Strobus, L.    WHITE PINE.    =Habitat and Range.=--In fertile soils; moist woodlands or dry uplands.         Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, through Quebec and Ontario, to Lake       Winnipeg.    New England,--common, from the vicinity of the seacoast to altitudes of  2500 feet, forming extensive forests.         South along the mountains to Georgia, ascending to 2500 feet in the       Adirondacks and to 4300 in North Carolina; west to Minnesota and       Iowa.    =Habit.=--The tallest tree and the stateliest conifer of the New England  forest, ordinarily from 50 to 80 feet high and 2-4 feet in diameter at  the ground, but in northern New England, where patches of the primeval  forest still remain, attaining a diameter of 3-7 feet and a height  ranging from 100 to 150 feet, rising in sombre majesty far above its  deciduous neighbors; trunk straight, tapering very gradually; branches  nearly horizontal, wide-spreading, in young trees in whorls usually of  five, the whorls becoming more or less indistinct in old trees;  branchlets and season's shoots slender; head cone-shaped, broad at the  base, clothed with soft, delicate, bluish-green foliage; roots running  horizontally near the surface, taking firm hold in rocky situations,  extremely durable when exposed.    =Bark.=--On trunks of old trees thick, shallow-channeled, broad-ridged;  on stems of young trees and upon branches smooth, greenish; season's  shoots at first rusty-scurfy or puberulent, in late autumn becoming  smooth and light russet brown.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Leading branch-buds 1/4-1/2 inch long, oblong  or ovate-oblong, sharp-pointed; scales yellowish-brown.    Foliage leaves in clusters of five, slender, 3-5 inches long, soft  bluish-green, needle-shaped, 3-sided, mucronate, each with a single  fibrovascular bundle, sessile.    =Inflorescence.=--June. Sterile flowers at the base of the season's  shoots, in clusters, each flower about one inch long, oval, light brown;  stamens numerous; connectives scale-like: fertile flowers near the  terminal bud of the season's shoots, long-stalked, cylindrical; scales  pink-margined.    =Fruit.=--Cones, 4-6 inches long, short-stalked, narrow-cylindrical,  often curved, finally pendent, green, maturing the second year; scales  rather loose, scarcely thickened at the apex, not spiny; seeds winged,  smooth.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; free from disease;  grows well in almost any soil, but prefers a light fertile loam; in open  ground retains its lower branches for many years. Good plants, grown  from seed, are usually readily obtainable in nurseries; small collected  plants from open ground can be moved in sods with little risk.    Several horticultural forms are occasionally cultivated which are  distinguished by variations in foliage, trailing branches, dense and  rounded heads, and dwarfed or cylindrical habits of growth.

The following instances illustrate the present correct usage in regard  to these three ways of leaving cards.      CASES IN WHICH PERSONAL CARD-LEAVING IS REQUIRED    After a _first hospitality_, whether accepted or not.    Calls of condolence.    After-dinner calls by cards.    _Alternative_.--In such cases, when _personal_ card-leaving is  _impossible_, the card is sent by a private messenger, and an  explanation, or apology, is sent by _note_.    Cards of condolence may be sent by _post_ by friends at a distance; but  not by persons residing in the near vicinity.      CARDS BY MESSENGER, OR BY POST    In all cases where personal card-leaving is not imperative, cards may  be sent either by messenger or by post.    As the former is still regarded by many persons--especially elderly  people--as the only strictly polite medium of transfer, it is  considerate to send cards, invitations, etc., to such people by the  good old-fashioned messenger, rather than to shock unnecessarily a  crystallized sense of propriety by ruthless innovations.  But in  general it is more convenient and quite as neat and reliable to send by  post; and the fashion of so doing is now fully adopted by the younger  generation, and no longer subject to criticism.    In stating what _may_ be done, in the way of escaping personal tasks,  we are merely marking the bounds of propriety in one direction.  On the  other hand, in most cases, those who choose may make personal calls  instead of those several formal card-leavings.  When good form allows  alternatives, each one must judge for himself which form of expression  is most appropriate in any given case.  Frank cordiality, amounting to  informality, may be in the best taste in some oases; whereas, in other  instances, only the most conventional and reserved expression of  respect is either agreeable or discreet.  In the latter case, let your  card speak _for_ you, and at \"long range\"--the longer the better.      CARD-LEAVING BY PROXY    One of the peculiar permissions of \"good form\" is that which allows a  man to delegate the distribution of his visiting-cards to a near female  relative, whenever it becomes impracticable for him to attend to the  matter personally.  Only the women of his own household, or a relative  with whom he habitually pays visits, can thus represent a man by proxy.    In this country, where most society men--certainly the better  element--are \"business men,\" whose days are filled with earnest work  and crowned with the achievements of industry, it is not to be expected  that men of affairs will always be ready to respond to social  invitations, or to pay all the calls of civility which fashion decrees  shall be paid during the hours usually devoted to business.  In theory,  each man and woman in society is supposed to attend to his or her own  social duties.  _While it is expected that a man will make all  reasonable effort to do this, and that he will not altogether neglect  it_, still, so long as he occasionally appears personally, with a  genial demeanor that proves the sincerity of his \"good intentions,\" it  will be accepted in good part if, in a large number of instances, his  card, instead of himself, appears, brought by another hand.  But let  men remember that the \"good excuse\" must be obvious.  Any suspicion of  indifference robs the proxy card-leaving of all effect as a compliment.    In case a man is legitimately prevented, by business cares, from paying  calls or leaving his cards in person, it is proper for his wife or  mother or sister, or other near relative, to leave or send his card  with her own.  When a woman calls upon another woman she leaves her  husband's card.  If the hostess is married, a second card is left for  the host.  She may leave the cards of a son, a brother, or other  relative, if such responsibility rests upon her.  This formality should  be observed when paying the first call of the season.    While every well-informed woman should know that it is her place to  leave her husband's cards for him, it is a fact that many women,  otherwise attentive to social forms, habitually neglect this particular  duty.  The result is that the man who has not time to pay visits  becomes a social nonentity, and society, in some circles, is simply a  \"world of women.\"  Why does the husband, thus neglected, get out of  going to the occasional party whenever he can, and when he does allow  himself to be dragged thither, why does he sulk, leaning against a  chilly mantel-piece, eying his fragile coffee cup with disdain, and  enacting the _role_ of martyr generally, until he can persuade his wife  to go home again?  Why, indeed; but because he feels out of place.  His  rare and incidental appearance is a journey into a far country, of  which he has little knowledge, and in which he has no interest.  But  when a man goes--ever so seldom--where he knows that his card  _habitually_ goes, he feels that he is on familiar ground, and he will  go in person, of choice, oftener than he otherwise would.    Some men, unaccustomed to exact social observances, would ridicule the  idea at first, if their wives should announce the intention of leaving  their husband's cards for them.  But, however much a man might demur, a  lurking vanity would develop into complacent satisfaction, as he became  aware of the increasing geniality of the social atmosphere about him;  and the pleasing glow would take the ultimate form of gratitude to his  wife.    That the permission to leave cards by proxy is often abused by selfish  and indolent men is no doubt true.  But the social advantage which it  gives to a large class of men who are neither selfish nor indolent more  than counterbalances any disadvantages, and saves to \"society\" a solid  element that might be entirely given over to business, if it were not  for judicious feminine co-operation in the distribution of  visiting-cards.    \"Solid\" men would go \"into society\" far more frequently and with  greater alacrity if they felt assured that the way had been smoothly  paved with their own visiting-cards, well laid in place by the deft  fingers of their skillful women folk, who have left no flaw in the  mosaic of social proprieties.      SOME FURTHER ILLUSTRATIONS OF CARD USAGE    When a married, or elderly woman tacitly invites a man to call on her  by telling him what are her \"at home\" days or hours, it is obligatory  upon him to acknowledge the courtesy.  If unable to call personally he  should explain that fact and express regret, and should be particular  to send a card on her next receiving day during the hours that she has  mentioned.  It is a special courtesy to send also a card for her  husband, if he is a venerable man, or if, by reason of ill health, he  is usually at home.    A woman older, or busier, or occupying some position of acknowledged  distinction, may send her card, indicating her receiving days and  hours, to a younger or less occupied woman.  This is accepted as a  call, and an invitation to return the same.  If the recipient chooses  she may respond in person.  If she does not care to establish a calling  acquaintance she may respond by sending one of her own cards on the  receiving day.  In case opportunity occurs for explanation some polite  reason may be given for not adding to one's visiting list; but unless  one has the tact to do this without snobbishness, it were better to  keep silence.    Cards of introduction are simply visiting-cards upon which the owner  writes, above his own name, \"Introducing Mr. ----.\"  The card is  inclosed in an unsealed envelope, addressed to the person to whom the  introduction is to be made, and with the words \"Introducing Mr. ----,\"  written in the lower left corner.  It is a delicate matter to refuse a  card or letter of introduction, but it is a far more delicate matter to  take the _liberty_ to give one.  If one is in doubt about the readiness  of the third party to receive the person introduced it is better to  find some polite excuse for declining to be the medium of the  introduction.  Fortunately, if the blunder is made of introducing  uncongenial people they can easily drift apart again without rudeness  on the part of either.    When any one is invited to a church wedding and cannot attend it is  proper to send, on the day of the marriage, a card or cards to those  who issued the invitations; one card, if one parent, or a guardian,  invites; if the invitation is sent in the names of both parents, a card  for each, inclosed in an envelope and addressed to both.  If the  invited guest attends the wedding he leaves or sends cards within a  week, similarly addressed.  A personal call is allowable if intimacy  warrants it.  Those friends of the groom who are not acquainted with  the bride's family should merely send cards.    When a man wishes to make the acquaintance of another man he may call  and send in his card.  This may or may not be accompanied with some  explanatory message.  If the man on whom the call is made does not wish  to receive the caller he will express some polite reason for declining,  or suggest another time for receiving the visitor.  Usually a man will  receive another man who makes polite overtures; but if the host does  not wish to continue the acquaintance he will not return the call in  person, but simply send his card by post.  This distant rejoinder  practically ends the brief acquaintance without any discourteous  rebuff.  It is one of the mistakes of the vulgar to be rude and gruff  in order to repel an undesired acquaintance.  In reality, nothing  freezes out a bore more effectually than the icy calm of dignified  courtesy.  There are exquisitely polite ways of sending every  undesirable person to limbo.  The perfect self-command of the well-bred  man enables him to do this to perfection, but without giving offense."]]]
