Just so is it with one of our Women.  When her  side is turned towards us, we see her as a straight line; when the end  containing her eye or mouth--for with us these two organs are  identical--is the part that meets our eye, then we see nothing but a  highly lustrous point; but when the back is presented to our view,  then--being only sub-lustrous, and, indeed, almost as dim as an  inanimate object--her hinder extremity serves her as a kind of  Invisible Cap.    The dangers to which we are exposed from our Women must now be manifest  to the meanest capacity in Spaceland.  If even the angle of a  respectable Triangle in the middle class is not without its dangers; if  to run against a Working Man involves a gash; if collision with an  officer of the military class necessitates a serious wound; if a mere  touch from the vertex of a Private Soldier brings with it danger of  death;--what can it be to run against a Woman, except absolute and  immediate destruction?  And when a Woman is invisible, or visible only  as a dim sub-lustrous point, how difficult must it be, even for the  most cautious, always to avoid collision!    Many are the enactments made at different times in the different States  of Flatland, in order to minimize this peril; and in the Southern and  less temperate climates where the force of gravitation is greater, and  human beings more liable to casual and involuntary motions, the Laws  concerning Women are naturally much more stringent.  But a general view  of the Code may be obtained from the following summary:--      1.  Every house shall have one entrance in the Eastern side, for the  use of Females only; by which all females shall enter \"in a becoming  and respectful manner\" and not by the Men's or Western door.  [Note:  When I was in Spaceland I understood that some of your Priestly circles  have in the same way a separate entrance for Villagers, Farmers and  Teachers of Board Schools (`Spectator', Sept. 1884, p. 1255) that they  may \"approach in a becoming and respectful manner.\"]    2.  No Female shall walk in any public place without continually  keeping up her Peace-cry, under penalty of death.    3.  Any Female, duly certified to be suffering from St. Vitus's Dance,  fits, chronic cold accompanied by violent sneezing, or any disease  necessitating involuntary motions, shall be instantly destroyed.      In some of the States there is an additional Law forbidding Females,  under penalty of death, from walking or standing in any public place  without moving their backs constantly from right to left so as to  indicate their presence to those behind them; others oblige a Woman,  when travelling, to be followed by one of her sons, or servants, or by  her husband; others confine Women altogether to their houses except  during the religious festivals.  But it has been found by the wisest of  our Circles or Statesmen that the multiplication of restrictions on  Females tends not only to the debilitation and diminution of the race,  but also to the increase of domestic murders to such an extent that a  State loses more than it gains by a too prohibitive Code.    For whenever the temper of the Women is thus exasperated by confinement  at home or hampering regulations abroad, they are apt to vent their  spleen upon their husbands and children; and in the less temperate  climates the whole male population of a village has been sometimes  destroyed in one or two hours of simultaneous female outbreak.  Hence  the Three Laws, mentioned above, suffice for the better regulated  States, and may be accepted as a rough exemplification of our Female  Code.    After all, our principal safeguard is found, not in Legislature, but in  the interests of the Women themselves.  For, although they can inflict  instantaneous death by a retrograde movement, yet unless they can at  once disengage their stinging extremity from the struggling body of  their victim, their own frail bodies are liable to be shattered.    The power of Fashion is also on our side.  I pointed out that in some  less civilized States no female is suffered to stand in any public  place without swaying her back from right to left.  This practice has  been universal among ladies of any pretensions to breeding in all  well-governed States, as far back as the memory of Figures can reach.  It is considered a disgrace to any State that legislation should have  to enforce what ought to be, and is in every respectable female, a  natural instinct.  The rhythmical and, if I may so say, well-modulated  undulation of the back in our ladies of Circular rank is envied and  imitated by the wife of a common Equilateral, who can achieve nothing  beyond a mere monotonous swing, like the ticking of a pendulum; and the  regular tick of the Equilateral is no less admired and copied by the  wife of the progressive and aspiring Isosceles, in the females of whose  family no \"back-motion\" of any kind has become as yet a necessity of  life.  Hence, in every family of position and consideration, \"back  motion\" is as prevalent as time itself; and the husbands and sons in  these households enjoy immunity at least from invisible attacks.    Not that it must be for a moment supposed that our Women are destitute  of affection.  But unfortunately the passion of the moment  predominates, in the Frail Sex, over every other consideration.  This  is, of course, a necessity arising from their unfortunate conformation.  For as they have no pretensions to an angle, being inferior in this  respect to the very lowest of the Isosceles, they are consequently  wholly devoid of brain-power, and have neither reflection, judgment nor  forethought, and hardly any memory.  Hence, in their fits of fury, they  remember no claims and recognize no distinctions.  I have actually  known a case where a Woman has exterminated her whole household, and  half an hour afterwards, when her rage was over and the fragments swept  away, has asked what has become of her husband and her children.    Obviously then a Woman is not to be irritated as long as she is in a  position where she can turn round.  When you have them in their  apartments--which are constructed with a view to denying them that  power--you can say and do what you like; for they are then wholly  impotent for mischief, and will not remember a few minutes hence the  incident for which they may be at this moment threatening you with  death, nor the promises which you may have found it necessary to make  in order to pacify their fury.    On the whole we get on pretty smoothly in our domestic relations,  except in the lower strata of the Military Classes.  There the want of  tact and discretion on the part of the husbands produces at times  indescribable disasters.  Relying too much on the offensive weapons of  their acute angles instead of the defensive organs of good sense and  seasonable simulation, these reckless creatures too often neglect the  prescribed construction of the women's apartments, or irritate their  wives by ill-advised expressions out of doors, which they refuse  immediately to retract.  Moreover a blunt and stolid regard for literal  truth indisposes them to make those lavish promises by which the more  judicious Circle can in a moment pacify his consort.  The result is  massacre; not, however, without its advantages, as it eliminates the  more brutal and troublesome of the Isosceles; and by many of our  Circles the destructiveness of the Thinner Sex is regarded as one among  many providential arrangements for suppressing redundant population,  and nipping Revolution in the bud.    Yet even in our best regulated and most approximately Circular families  I cannot say that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in  Spaceland.  There is peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may  be called by that name, but there is necessarily little harmony of  tastes or pursuits; and the cautious wisdom of the Circles has ensured  safety at the cost of domestic comfort.  In every Circular or Polygonal  household it has been a habit from time immemorial--and now has become  a kind of instinct among the women of our higher classes--that the  mothers and daughters should constantly keep their eyes and mouths  towards their husband and his male friends; and for a lady in a family  of distinction to turn her back upon her husband would be regarded as a  kind of portent, involving loss of STATUS.  But, as I shall soon shew,  this custom, though it has the advantage of safety, is not without its  disadvantages.    In the house of the Working Man or respectable Tradesman--where the  wife is allowed to turn her back upon her husband, while pursuing her  household avocations--there are at least intervals of quiet, when the  wife is neither seen nor heard, except for the humming sound of the  continuous Peace-cry; but in the homes of the upper classes there is  too often no peace.  There the voluble mouth and bright penetrating eye  are ever directed towards the Master of the household; and light itself  is not more persistent than the stream of feminine discourse.  The tact  and skill which suffice to avert a Woman's sting are unequal to the  task of stopping a Woman's mouth; and as the wife has absolutely  nothing to say, and absolutely no constraint of wit, sense, or  conscience to prevent her from saying it, not a few cynics have been  found to aver that they prefer the danger of the death-dealing but  inaudible sting to the safe sonorousness of a Woman's other end.    To my readers in Spaceland the condition of our Women may seem truly  deplorable, and so indeed it is.  A Male of the lowest type of the  Isosceles may look forward to some improvement of his angle, and to the  ultimate elevation of the whole of his degraded caste; but no Woman can  entertain such hopes for her sex.  \"Once a Woman, always a Woman\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20102"],[0,"The International Monthly Magazine - Volume V - No II (#4)"],[1,"a poetic taste and  temperament _without_ the inspiration, the world is apt to mistake the  eccentricity of the pretender for the outward and visible sign of genius.  Whether or not the poet of the Porch-house of Chertsey had the actual  poetic fire we do not venture to determine. Abraham Cowley takes a  prominent position, amongst the poets of our land, and the eventful times  in which he lived, and his participation in their tumults give him  additional interest in all the relations of his anxious and not over-happy  life. It is recorded of him that he became a poet in consequence of  reading the Faery Queene, which chance threw in his way while yet a child.  In allusion to this, Dr. Johnson gave his well-known definition of genius:  \"A mind of large general powers, accidentally determined to some  particular direction.\" We had almost dared to say this is rather the  definition of a philosopher than of one who comprehended the spirituality  of a marvellous gift. Abraham Cowley--the posthumous son of a London  grocer--owed much to his mother. She, by her exertions, procured him a  classical education at Westminster School. She lived to see him loved,  honored, and great, and what was better still, and more uncommon,  grateful. At the age of fifteen he published a volume called \"Poetic  Blossoms,\" which he afterwards described as \"commendable extravagancies in  a boy.\" He obtained a scholarship in Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1686,  and there took his degree; but was ejected by the Parliament, and thence  removed to Oxford. Shortly after, he followed the Queen Henrietta to  Paris, as Secretary to the Earl of St. Albans, and was employed in the  court of the exiles in the most confidential capacity. In 1656 he returned  to England, and was immediately arrested as a suspected spy. He submitted  quietly--the royalists thought too quietly--to the dominion of the  Protector, but his whole life proved that he was no traitor. At the  Restoration, that great national disappointment, his claims upon the  ungrateful monarch were met by a taunt and a false insinuation--he was told  that his pardon was his reward! Wood said, \"he lost the place by certain  enemies of the Muses;\" certain \"friends of the Muses,\" however, procured  for him the lease of the Porch-house and farm at Chertsey, held under the  Queen, and the great desire of his life--solitude--was obtained.                   [Illustration: COWLEY'S HOUSE--GARDEN FRONT.]                           COWLEY'S HOUSE--GARDEN FRONT.      The place still seems a meet dwelling for a poet, and is, perhaps, even  more attractive to strangers than St. Anne's hill. The porch, which caused  his residence to be called \"The Porch-house,\" was taken down during the  last century by the father of its present proprietor, the Rev. John Crosby  Clarke, and the house is now known as \"Cowley House.\"(1) It is situated  near the bridge which crosses a narrow and rapid stream, in a lonely part  of Guildford Street; a latticed window which overhangs the road is the  window of the room in which the poet expired; on the outside wall Mr.  Clarke has recorded his reason for removing the porch. \"The porch of this  house, which projected ten feet into the highway, was taken down in the  year 1786, for the safety and accommodation of the public.\"      \"Here the last accents flowed from Cowley's tongue.\"                    [Illustration: STAIRCASE--COWLEY'S HOUSE.]                            STAIRCASE--COWLEY'S HOUSE.      The appearance of the house from Guildford Street, is no index to its size  or conveniences.(2) You enter by a side gate, and the new front of the  dwelling is that of a comfortable and gentlemanly home; the old part it is  said was built in the reign of James the First, and what remains is  sufficiently quaint to bear out the legend; the old and new are much  mingled, and the modern part consists of one or two bed-rooms, a large  dining-room, and a drawing-room, commanding a delicious garden view, the  meanderings of the stream, and a long tract of luxuriant meadows,  terminated by the high and richly timbered ground of St. Anne's Hill. A  portion of the old stairway is preserved, the wood is not as has been  stated oak, but sweet chestnut. One of the rooms is panelled with oak, and  Cowley's study is a small closet-like chamber, the window looking towards  St. Anne's Hill. It is never difficult to imagine a poet in a _small  chamber_, particularly when his mind may imbibe inspiration from so rich  and lovely a landscape. Beside the group of trees, beneath whose shadow  the poet frequently sat, there is a horse chestnut of such exceeding size  and beauty, that it is worthy a pilgrimage, and no lover of nature could  look upon it without mingled feelings of reverence and affection.    Here then amid such tranquil scenes, and such placid beauty, the  \"melancholy Cowley,\" passed the later days of big anxious existence; here  we may fancy him receiving Evelyn and Denham, the poets and men of letters  of his troubled day, who found the disappointments of courtly life more  than their philosophy could endure. Here his friendly biographer, Doctor  Spratt, cheered his lonely hours.    Cowley was one of those fortunate bards who obtain fame and honor during  life. His learning was deep, his reading extensive, his acquaintance with  mankind large. \"To him,\" says Denham in his famous elegy,      \"To him no author was unknown,    Yet what he wrote was all his own.\"    His biographer adds, \"There was nothing affected or singular in his habit,  or person, or gesture; _he understood the forms of good breeding enough to  practise them without burdening himself or others_.\" This indeed is the  perfection of good breeding and good sense.    Having obtained, as we have said, the Porch-house at Chertsey, his mind  dwelt with pleasure--a philosophic pleasure--upon the hereafter, which he  hoped for in this life of tranquillity, and the silent labor he so dearly  loved; but he was destined to prove the reality of his own poesy:      \"Oh life, thou _Nothing's_ younger brother,    So _like_ that one might take one for the other.\"    The career of Abraham Cowley was never sullied by vice,(3) he was loyal  without being servile, and at once modest, independent and sincere. His  character is eloquently drawn by Doctor Spratt. \"He governed his passions  with great moderation, his virtues were never troublesome or uneasy to  any, whatever he disliked in others he only corrected by the silent  reproof of a better practice.\"    He died at Chertsey on the 28th of July, 1667, and was interred in  Westminster Abbey. A throng of nobles followed him to his grave, and the  worthless king who had deserted him is reported to have said, that Mr.  Cowley had not left a better man behind him in England.    It is said the body of Cowley was removed from Chertsey by water, thus  making the Thames he loved so well, the highway to his grave; there is  something highly poetic in this idea of a funeral, so still and solemn,  with the oars dropping noiselessly in the blue water. Pope in allusion to  it, says:      \"What tears the river shed,    When the sad pomp along his banks was led;\"    which rather inclines us to the belief, that in this, as in many other  instances, the poetic reading is not the true one,      \"The muses oft in lands of vision play:\"    but the fact that he died at Chertsey, as much respected as a man, as he  was admired as a poet, is certain, and his house is often visited by  strangers, who are permitted to see his favorite haunts by the kindness of  its proprietor, who honors the spot so hallowed by memories of \"the  melancholy Cowley:\"--he who considered and described \"business\" as:      \"The contradiction to his fate.\"    But we must postpone our farther rambles for the present.                     [Illustration: TREES ON ST ANNE'S HILL.]                             TREES ON ST ANNE'S HILL.        Chertsey loses half its romantic interest by the intrusion of the  progressive agents of our time--our noisy time, of which the spirit  willingly brooks no souvenirs of monastic repose. The old quaint quiet  town has now its railroad, and the shades of its heroes have departed.            TRAUGOTT BROMME ON THE UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA, TEXAS AND THE  COLONIES.      We have at different times, by reviews or translations, endeavored to give  our readers some idea of what people think of us, in continental Europe.  But there are two sides to every thing--or there is an universal dualism,  as Emerson declares--which is perfectly true as to the method which might  be adopted in the execution of this self-imposed task. One class of  readers understand by the word _people_ the _beau monde_, and would have  us invariably follow the school of the Countesses Hahn-Hahn or Ladies  Blessington or Milords Fitz-Flummery, contented if we have but a fair name  in society. Another and more reasonable class would be satisfied to know  the opinion of the literati, or perhaps the poets, particularly when they  do fit homage to our \"grand old woods,\" and to Niagara. Others regard with  most respect a plain literal account of our branches of industry--our  railroads, factories, and canals. They would have the country judged  purely from a mechanical or practical point of view--contenting themselves  as to other matters with the reflection. \"Oh, sensible people care very  little about any thing else. If they know what we produce, and what our  resources are, they'll understand and respect us sufficiently.\"    Now the opinion of each of these classes has its weight, and though not of  the _greatest_ ultimate importance, is always to be respected. If we were  questioned as to the views of which of them we yielded full regard, we  should candidly say, \"to none.\" It is the general, universal opinion, of a  nation at large that we deem authoritative, and none other. It is that  popular opinion so readily yet often so"]]]
