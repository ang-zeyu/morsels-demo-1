But it was with no little fear that Kwan-yu undertook the casting of the  great bell.    \"Can a carpenter make shoes?\" he had protested, when Ming-lin had broken  the Emperor's message to him.    \"Yes,\" replied the other quickly, \"if they be like those worn by the  little island dwarfs, and, therefore, made of wood. Bells and cannon are  cast from similar material. You ought easily to adapt yourself to this  new work.\"    Now when Kwan-yu's daughter found out what he was about to undertake,  she was filled with a great fear.    \"Oh, honoured father,\" she cried, \"think well before you give this  promise. As a cannon-maker you are successful, but who can say about the  other task? And if you fail, the Great One's wrath will fall heavily  upon you.\"    \"Just hear the girl,\" interrupted the ambitious mother. \"What do you  know about success and failure? You'd better stick to the subject of  cooking and baby-clothes, for you will soon be married. As for your  father, pray let him attend to his own business. It is unseemly for  a girl to meddle in her father's affairs.\"    And so poor Ko-ai--for that was the maiden's name--was silenced, and  went back to her fancy-work with a big tear stealing down her fair  cheek, for she loved her father dearly and there had come into her heart  a strange terror at thought of his possible danger.    Meanwhile, Kwan-yu was summoned to the Forbidden City, which is in the  centre of Peking, and in which stands the Imperial palace. There he  received his instructions from the Son of Heaven.    \"And remember,\" said Yung-lo in conclusion, \"this bell must be so great  that the sound of it will ring out to a distance of thirty-three miles  on every hand. To this end, you should add in proper proportions gold  and brass, for they give depth and strength to everything with which  they mingle. Furthermore, in order that this giant may not be lacking in  the quality of sweetness, you must add silver in due proportion, while  the sayings of the sages must be graven on its sides.\"    Now when Kwan-yu had really received his commission from the  Emperor he searched the bookstalls of the city to find if possible  some ancient descriptions of the best methods used in bell-casting. Also  he offered generous wages to all who had ever had experience in the  great work for which he was preparing. Soon his great foundry was alive  with labourers; huge fires were burning; great piles of gold, silver and  other metals were lying here and there, ready to be weighed.    Whenever Kwan-yu went out to a public tea-house all of his friends plied  him with questions about the great bell.    \"Will it be the largest in the world?\"    \"Oh, no,\" he would reply, \"that is not necessary, but it must be the  sweetest-toned, for we Chinese strive not for size, but for purity; not  for greatness, but for virtue.\"    \"When will it be finished?\"    \"Only the gods can tell, for I have had little experience, and perhaps I  shall fail to mix the metals properly.\"    Every few days the Son of Heaven himself would send an imperial  messenger to ask similar questions, for a king is likely to be just as  curious as his subjects, but Kwan-yu would always modestly reply that he  could not be certain; it was very doubtful when the bell would be ready.    At last, however, after consulting an astrologer, Kwan-yu appointed  a day for the casting, and then there came another courtier robed in  splendid garments, saying that at the proper hour the Great One himself  would for the first time cross Kwan-yu's threshold--would come to see  the casting of the bell he had ordered for his people. On hearing this,  Kwan-yu was sore afraid, for he felt that somehow, in spite of all his  reading, in spite of all the advice he had received from well-wishers,  there was something lacking in the mixture of the boiling metals that  would soon be poured into the giant mould. In short, Kwan-yu was about  to discover an important truth that this great world has been thousands  of years in learning--namely, that mere reading and advice cannot  produce skill, that true skill can come only from years of experience  and practice. On the brink of despair, he sent a servant with money to  the temple, to pray to the gods for success in his venture. Truly,  despair and prayer rhyme in every language.    Ko-ai, his daughter, was also afraid when she saw the cloud on her  father's brow, for she it was, you remember, who had tried to prevent  him from undertaking the Emperor's commission. She also went to the  temple, in company with a faithful old servant, and prayed to heaven.    The great day dawned. The Emperor and his courtiers were assembled, the  former sitting on a platform built for the occasion. Three attendants  waved beautiful hand-painted fans about his imperial brow, for the room  was very warm, and a huge block of ice lay melting in a bowl of carved  brass, cooling the hot air before it should blow upon the head of the  Son of Heaven.    Kwan-yu's wife and daughter stood in a corner at the back of the room,  peering anxiously towards the cauldron of molten liquid, for well they  knew that Kwan-yu's future rank and power depended on the success of  this enterprise. Around the walls stood Kwan-yu's friends, and at the  windows groups of excited servants strained their necks, trying to catch  a glimpse of royalty, and for once afraid to chatter. Kwan-yu himself  was hurrying hither and thither, now giving a final order, now gazing  anxiously at the empty mould, and again glancing towards the throne to  see if his imperial master was showing signs of impatience.    At last all was ready; everyone was waiting breathlessly for the sign  from Yung-lo which should start the flowing of the metal. A slight bow  of the head, a lifting of the finger! The glowing liquid, hissing with  delight at being freed even for a moment from its prison, ran forward  faster and faster along the channel that led into the great earthen bed.    The bell-maker covered his eyes with his fan, afraid to look at the  swiftly-flowing stream. Were all his hopes to be suddenly dashed by the  failure of the metals to mix and harden properly? A heavy sigh escaped  him as at last he looked up at the thing he had created. Something had  indeed gone wrong; he knew in the flash of an eye that misfortune had  overtaken him.    Yes! sure enough, when at last the earthen casting had been broken, even  the smallest child could see that the giant bell, instead of being a  thing of beauty was a sorry mass of metals that would not blend.    \"Alas!\" said Yung-lo, \"here is indeed a mighty failure, but even in this  disappointment I see an object lesson well worthy of consideration, for  behold! in yonder elements are all the materials of which this country  is made up. There are gold and silver and the baser metals. United in  the proper manner they would make a bell so wonderfully beautiful and so  pure of tone that the very spirits of the Western heavens would pause to  look and listen. But divided they form a thing that is hideous to eye  and ear. Oh, my China! how many wars are there from time to time among  the different sections, weakening the country and making it poor! If  only all these peoples, great and small, the gold and silver and the  baser elements, would unite, then would this land be really worthy of  the name of the Middle Kingdom!\"    The courtiers all applauded this speech of the great Yung-lo, but  Kwan-yu remained on the ground where he had thrown himself at the feet  of his sovereign. Still bowing his head and moaning, he cried out:    \"Ah! your Majesty! I urged you not to appoint me, and now indeed you see  my unfitness. Take my life, I beg you, as a punishment for my failure.\"    \"Rise, Kwan-yu,\" said the great Prince. \"I would be a mean master indeed  if I did not grant you another trial. Rise up and see that your next  casting profits by the lesson of this failure.\"    So Kwan-yu arose, for when the King speaks, all men must listen. The  next day he began his task once more, but still his heart was heavy,  for he knew not the reason of his failure and was therefore unable to  correct his error. For many months he laboured night and day. Hardly a  word would he speak to his wife, and when his daughter tried to tempt  him with a dish of sunflower seed that she had parched herself, he would  reward her with a sad smile, but would by no means laugh with her and  joke as had formerly been his custom. On the first and fifteenth day of  every moon he went himself to the temple and implored the gods to grant  him their friendly assistance, while Ko-ai added her prayers to his,  burning incense and weeping before the grinning idols.    Again the great Yung-lo was seated on the platform in Kwan-yu's foundry,  and again his courtiers hovered round him, but this time, as it was  winter, they did not flirt the silken fans. The Great One was certain  that this casting would be successful. He had been lenient with Kwan-yu  on the first occasion, and now at last he and the great city were to  profit by that mercy.    Again he gave the signal; once more every neck was craned to see the  flowing of the metal. But, alas! when the casing was removed it was seen  that the new bell was no better than the first. It was, in fact, a  dreadful failure, cracked and ugly, for the gold and silver and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1872"],[0,"The Red House Mystery (#4)"],[1," Beverley and he met again  a little later at a restaurant. Both of them were in evening-dress, but  they did different things with their napkins, and Antony was the more  polite of the two. However, he still liked Bill. So on one of his  holidays, when he was unemployed, he arranged an introduction through a  mutual friend. Beverley was a little inclined to be shocked when he was  reminded of their previous meetings, but his uncomfortable feeling soon  wore off, and he and Antony quickly became intimate. But Bill generally  addressed him as \"Dear Madman\" when he happened to write.    Antony decided to stroll over to the Red House after lunch and call  upon his friend. Having inspected his bedroom which was not quite the  lavender-smelling country-inn bedroom of fiction, but sufficiently clean  and comfortable, he set out over the fields.    As he came down the drive and approached the old red-brick front of the  house, there was a lazy murmur of bees in the flower-borders, a gentle  cooing of pigeons in the tops of the elms, and from distant lawns the  whir of a mowing-machine, that most restful of all country sounds....    And in the hall a man was banging at a locked door, and shouting, \"Open  the door, I say; open the door!\"    \"Hallo!\" said Antony in amazement.          CHAPTER III. Two Men and a Body      Cayley looked round suddenly at the voice.    \"Can I help?\" said Antony politely.    \"Something's happened,\" said Cayley. He was breathing quickly. \"I heard  a shot--it sounded like a shot--I was in the library. A loud bang--I  didn't know what it was. And the door's locked.\" He rattled the handle  again, and shook it. \"Open the door!\" he cried. \"I say, Mark, what is  it? Open the door!\"    \"But he must have locked the door on purpose,\" said Antony. \"So why  should he open it just because you ask him to?\"    Cayley looked at him in a bewildered way. Then he turned to the door  again. \"We must break it in,\" he said, putting his shoulder to it. \"Help  me.\"    \"Isn't there a window?\"    Cayley turned to him stupidly.    \"Window? Window?\"    \"So much easier to break in a window,\" said Antony with a smile. He  looked very cool and collected, as he stood just inside the hall,  leaning on his stick, and thinking, no doubt, that a great deal of fuss  was being made about nothing. But then, he had not heard the shot.    \"Window--of course! What an idiot I am.\"    He pushed past Antony, and began running out into the drive. Antony  followed him. They ran along the front of the house, down a path to the  left, and then to the left again over the grass, Cayley in front, the  other close behind him. Suddenly Cayley looked over his shoulder and  pulled up short.    \"Here,\" he said.    They had come to the windows of the locked room, French windows which  opened on to the lawns at the back of the house. But now they were  closed. Antony couldn't help feeling a thrill of excitement as he  followed Cayley's example, and put his face close up to the glass. For  the first time he wondered if there really had been a revolver shot in  this mysterious room. It had all seemed so absurd and melodramatic from  the other side of the door. But if there had been one shot, why should  there not be two more?--at the careless fools who were pressing their  noses against the panes, and asking for it.    \"My God, can you see it?\" said Cayley in a shaking voice. \"Down there.  Look!\"    The next moment Antony saw it. A man was lying on the floor at the far  end of the room, his back towards them. A man? Or the body of a man?    \"Who is it?\" said Antony.    \"I don't know,\" the other whispered.    \"Well, we'd better go and see.\" He considered the windows for a moment.  \"I should think, if you put your weight into it, just where they join,  they'll give all right. Otherwise, we can kick the glass in.\"    Without saying anything, Cayley put his weight into it. The window gave,  and they went into the room. Cayley walked quickly to the body, and  dropped on his knees by it. For the moment he seemed to hesitate; then  with an effort he put a hand on to its shoulder and pulled it over.    \"Thank God!\" he murmured, and let the body go again.    \"Who is it?\" said Antony.    \"Robert Ablett.\"    \"Oh!\" said Antony. \"I thought his name was Mark,\" he added, more to  himself than to the other.    \"Yes, Mark Ablett lives here. Robert is his brother.\" He shuddered, and  said, \"I was afraid it was Mark.\"    \"Was Mark in the room too?\"    \"Yes,\" said Cayley absently. Then, as if resenting suddenly these  questions from a stranger, \"Who are you?\"    But Antony had gone to the locked door, and was turning the handle. \"I  suppose he put the key in his pocket,\" he said, as he came back to the  body again.    \"Who?\"    Antony shrugged his shoulders.    \"Whoever did this,\" he said, pointing to the man on the floor. \"Is he  dead?\"    \"Help me,\" said Cayley simply.    They turned the body on to its back, nerving themselves to look at it.  Robert Ablett had been shot between the eyes. It was not a pleasant  sight, and with his horror Antony felt a sudden pity for the man beside  him, and a sudden remorse for the careless, easy way in which he had  treated the affair. But then one always went about imagining that  these things didn't happen--except to other people. It was difficult to  believe in them just at first, when they happened to yourself.    \"Did you know him well?\" said Antony quietly. He meant, \"Were you fond  of him?\"    \"Hardly at all. Mark is my cousin. I mean, Mark is the brother I know  best.\"    \"Your cousin?\"    \"Yes.\" He hesitated, and then said, \"Is he dead? I suppose he is. Will  you--do you know anything about--about that sort of thing? Perhaps I'd  better get some water.\"    There was another door opposite to the locked one, which led, as Antony  was to discover for himself directly, into a passage from which opened  two more rooms. Cayley stepped into the passage, and opened the door on  the right. The door from the office, through which he had gone, remained  open. The door, at the end of the short passage was shut. Antony,  kneeling by the body, followed Cayley with his eyes, and, after he had  disappeared, kept his eyes on the blank wall of the passage, but he was  not conscious of that at which he was looking, for his mind was with the  other man, sympathizing with him.    \"Not that water is any use to a dead body,\" he said to himself, \"but the  feeling that you're doing something, when there's obviously nothing to  be done, is a great comfort.\"    Cayley came into the room again. He had a sponge in one hand, a  handkerchief in the other. He looked at Antony. Antony nodded. Cayley  murmured something, and knelt down to bathe the dead man's face. Then he  placed the handkerchief over it. A little sigh escaped Antony, a sigh of  relief.    They stood up and looked at each other.    \"If I can be of any help to you,\" said Antony, \"please let me.\"    \"That's very kind of you. There will be things to do. Police, doctors--I  don't know. But you mustn't let me trespass on your kindness. Indeed, I  should apologise for having trespassed so much already.\"    \"I came to see Beverley. He is an old friend of mine.\"    \"He's out playing golf. He will be back directly.\" Then, as if he had  only just realized it, \"They will all be back directly.\"    \"I will stay if I can be of any help.\"    \"Please do. You see, there are women. It will be rather painful. If you  would--\" He hesitated, and gave Antony a timid little smile, pathetic  in so big and self-reliant a man. \"Just your moral support, you know. It  would be something.\"    \"Of course.\" Antony smiled back at him, and said cheerfully, \"Well,  then, I'll begin by suggesting that you should ring up the police.\"    \"The police? Y-yes.\" He looked doubtfully at the other. \"I suppose--\"    Antony spoke frankly.    \"Now, look here, Mr.--er--\"    \"Cayley. I'm Mark Ablett's cousin. I live with him.\"    \"My name's Gillingham. I'm sorry, I ought to have told you before. Well  now, Mr. Cayley, we shan't do any good by pretending. Here's a man been  shot--well, somebody shot him.\"    \"He might have shot himself,\" mumbled Cayley.    \"Yes, he might have, but he didn't. Or if he did, somebody was in the  room at the time, and that somebody isn't here now. And that somebody  took a revolver away with him. Well, the police will want to say a word  about that, won't they?\"    Cayley was silent, looking on the ground.    \"Oh, I know what you're thinking, and believe me I do sympathize with  you, but we can't be children about it. If your cousin Mark Ablett was  in the room with this\"--he indicated the body--\"this man, then--\"    \"Who said he was?\" said Cayley, jerking his head up suddenly at Antony.    \"You did.\"    \"I was in the library. Mark went in--he may have come out again--I know  nothing. Somebody else may have gone in--\"    \"Yes, yes,\" said Antony patiently, as if to a little child. \"You know  your cousin; I don't. Let's agree that he had nothing to do with it. But  somebody was in the room when this man was shot, and--well, the police  will have to know. Don't you think--\" He looked at the telephone. \"Or  would you rather I did it?\"    Cayley shrugged his shoulders and went to the telephone.    \"May I--er--look round a bit?\" Antony nodded towards the open door.    \"Oh, do. Yes.\" He sat down and drew the telephone towards him. \"You must  make allowances for me, Mr. Gillingham. You see, I've known Mark for a  very long time. But, of course, you're quite right, and I'm merely being  stupid.\" He took off the receiver.
