It was, indeed,  through a hint so acquired that we had been put upon the track of the  _Dona Isabella_.    Now, our own skipper, Captain Harrison, was particularly keen upon this  sort of work, and was exceptionally well qualified to achieve success in  it.  For, in the first place, he was a West Indian by birth, being the  son of a Trinidad sugar-planter, and he consequently spoke Creole  Spanish as fluently as he did his mother tongue.  Also his physical  characteristics were such as to be of the greatest assistance to him in  such enterprises; for he was tall, lean, and muscular, of swarthy  complexion, with thick, black, curly hair, and large, black, flashing  eyes, suggesting that he carried a touch of the tar-brush, although, as  a matter of fact, he had not a drop of negro blood in him.  He was a man  of dauntless courage, knowing not the meaning of fear, and absolutely  revelling in situations of the most extreme peril, yet gifted with quite  as much discretion as was needful for a man entrusted with heavy  responsibilities involving the lives of many of his fellow-men.  He  never sought danger for danger's sake alone, and never embarked in an  enterprise which his reason assured him was hopelessly impracticable,  but, on the other hand, he never hesitated to undertake the most  perilous task if he believed he could see a way to its successful  accomplishment.  It was his habit to assume a variety of disguises in  which he would haunt the third and fourth rate taverns of Freetown,  especially patronised by the slave-dealing fraternity, and mingling  freely with these gentry, would boldly express his own views, adopted,  of course, for the occasion, upon the various matters affecting the  trade, or discuss with them the most promising schemes for baffling the  efforts of the British cruisers.  He had noticed, very early in his  career as an officer of the Slave Squadron, that it was always the  _British_ who constituted the _bete noire_ of the slavers; the French  they feared very little; the Americans not at all.    These little incursions into the enemy's territory Captain Harrison  conducted with consummate boldness and skill, and with a considerable  measure of success, for it was quite a favourite amusement of his to  devise and suggest schemes of a particularly alluring character which,  when adopted by the enemy, he of course triumphantly circumvented  without difficulty.  There was only one fault to find with this  propensity on the part of our skipper, but in my humble judgment it  constituted a serious one.  It was this.  Captain Harrison's personality  was a distinctly striking one; he was the kind of man who, once seen, is  not easily forgotten; and I greatly dreaded that some day, sooner or  later, the reckless frequenter of the low-class Freetown taverns would  be identified as one and the same with the captain of H.M.S.  _Psyche_,  who was of course frequently to be seen about the streets in the uniform  of a British naval captain.  Indeed I once took the liberty of  delicately hinting at this possibility; but the skipper laughed at the  idea; he had, it appeared, the most implicit faith in his disguises,  which included, amongst other things, a huge false moustache of most  ferocious appearance, and an enormous pair of gold earrings.    We had been at Sierra Leone a little over a fortnight, and our business  there was just completed, when the skipper came aboard on a certain  afternoon in a state of the highest good-humour, occasioned, as soon  transpired, by the fact that he had succeeded in obtaining full  particulars of an exceptionally grand _coup_ that had been planned by a  number of slavers in conjunction, which they were perfectly confident of  pulling off triumphantly.    It appeared, from his story, that intelligence had just been received of  the successful conclusion of a great slave-hunting raid into the  interior by a certain King Olomba, who had recently returned in triumph  to his town of Olomba, on the left bank of the Fernan Vaz river,  bringing with him nearly three thousand negroes, of whom over two  thousand were males, all in prime condition.  This information having  reached the slavers' agents at Sierra Leone through the mysterious  channels by which news often travels in Africa, an effort of quite  exceptional magnitude was to be made to get at least the two thousand  males out of the country at one fell swoop; the present being regarded  as an almost uniquely favourable opportunity for the accomplishment of  this object, for the reason that the _Psyche_ was just then the only  ship which could by any possibility interfere with the scheme.  And in  the event of her happening to put in an inopportune appearance on that  part of the coast at the critical moment--as she had a knack of doing,  in the most unaccountable manner--she was to be decoyed away from the  spot by the simple process of dispatching to sea a certain notorious  schooner well-known to be in the trade, but which, for this occasion  only, was to have no slaves or slave fittings or adjuncts on board, and  after a chase of some two or three hundred miles to the southward, was  to permit herself to be caught, only to be released again, of course,  after an exhaustive overhaul.    It was an admirable scheme, beautifully simple, and could scarcely fail  to achieve complete success, but for the fact that Captain Harrison had  contrived to obtain full particulars of it, and therefore knew exactly  how to frustrate the plan.  His plot was as simple as that of the  slavers: he would proceed in the _Psyche_ to the scene of operations,  and when the decoy schooner made her appearance she would be permitted  to go on her way unmolested, while a boat expedition would be dispatched  up the river to the town of Olomba, where the vessels actually engaged  in shipping the two thousand blacks would be captured _flagrante  delicto_.    Naturally we were all thrown into a high state of jubilation at the  receipt of this intelligence; for it promised us a slice of good luck of  such magnitude as very seldom fell to the lot of a single cruiser.  To  convey two thousand negroes across the Atlantic at once would  necessitate the employment of at least three large ships, the value of  which might be roughly calculated at, upon the very lowest estimate, ten  thousand pounds each, or thirty thousand pounds in all, besides which  there would be the head-money upon two thousand negroes, amounting  altogether to quite a nice little sum in prize-money for a cruise of  probably less than a month's duration.  Oh, how we chuckled as we  pictured to ourselves the effect which the news of so magnificent a  _coup_ would create upon the minds of the rest of the Slave Squadron.  The _Psyche_, from her phenomenal lack of speed, and general  unsuitability for the service upon which she was employed, had, with her  crew, become the butt and laughing-stock of every stupid and scurrilous  jester on the coast, and many a time had we been made to writhe under  the lash of some more than ordinarily envenomed gibe; but now the laugh  was to be on our side; we were going to demonstrate to those shallow,  jeering wits the superiority of brains over a clean pair of heels.    Of course we were all in a perfect fever of impatience to get to sea and  make the best of our way to the scene of action, lest haply we should  arrive too late and find the birds flown; but the skipper retained his  coolness and would permit nothing to be done that could by any  possibility suggest to the slavers the idea that the faintest hint of  their audacious scheme had been allowed to get abroad.  He insisted that  we had plenty of time and to spare, and actually remained in harbour  three whole days after the information had reached him.  Then, on the  morning of the fourth day, we weighed and stood out to sea, beating off  the land against the sea-breeze until we ran into the calm belt between  the sea-breeze and the trade-wind.  Here we remained motionless for more  than an hour until the trade-wind gradually ate its way inshore and  reached us, when we ran right out to sea until we had sunk the land  astern of us.  Then we hauled up to the southward on a taut bowline,  and, under easy canvas, made our leisurely way toward the mouth of the  Fernan Vaz river, off which we arrived five days later, making the land  from the masthead about an hour before sunset.    All that night, the whole of the next day, and all the night following  we remained hove-to under topsails, jib, and spanker, dodging to and fro  athwart the mouth of the river, with a man on the main-royal yard,  during the hours of daylight, to give us timely notice of the appearance  of the craft which was to play the part of decoy; while with the  approach of nightfall we made sail and beat in to within a distance of  some three miles of the coast, running off into the offing again an hour  before daylight.  At length, when we had hung upon the tenterhooks of  suspense for close upon forty hours, and were beginning to fear that the  captain, in his resolve to cut matters as fine as possible, had overdone  the thing and allowed the quarry to escape, we were gladdened by the  hail from aloft of--    \"Sail he!  A large schooner just comin' out o' the river, sir.\"    \"Ay, ay,\" answered the first lieutenant, whose watch it happened to be.  \"Just keep your eye on her, my lad, and let me know how she steers when  she is clear of the bar.\"    We were heading to the southward at the time, and were about three miles  south of the river entrance, and some sixteen miles off the land; by  pretending therefore not to see her for the next quarter of an hour or  so, and keeping the _Psyche_ still heading to the southward, we should  afford"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#4)"],[1,"reasoning, and this reasoning  is further supported by a common-sense argument. The outer world  cannot be summarised in a few nervous systems suspended like spiders  in empty space. The existence of a nervous system implies that of a  body in which it is lodged. This body must have complicated organs;  its limbs presuppose the soil on which the animal rests, its lungs the  existence of oxygen vivifying its blood, its digestive tube, aliments  which it digests and assimilates to its substance, and so on. We may  indeed admit that this outer world is not, in itself, exactly as we  perceive it; but we are compelled to recognise that it exists by the  same right as the nervous system, in order to put it in its proper  place.    The second fact of observation is that the sensations we feel do not  give us the true image of the material _X_ which produces them. The  modification made in our substance by this force _X_ does not  necessarily resemble in its nature the nature of that force. This is  an assertion opposed to our natural opinions, and must consequently be  demonstrated. It is generally proved by the experiments which reveal  what is called \"the law of the specific energy of the nerves.\" This is  an important law in physiology discovered by Mueller two centuries ago,  and consequences of a philosophical order are attached to it. The  facts on which this law is based are these. It is observed that, if  the sensory nerves are agitated by an excitant which remains constant,  the sensations received by the patient differ according to the nerve  affected. Thus, the terminals of an electric current applied to the  ball of the eye give the sensation of a small luminous spark; to the  auditory apparatus, the current causes a crackling sound; to the hand,  the sensation of a shock; to the tongue, a metallic flavour.  Conversely, excitants wholly different, but affecting the same nerve,  give similar sensations; whether a ray of light is projected into the  eye, or the eyeball be excited by the pressure of a finger; whether an  electric current is directed into the eye, or, by a surgical  operation, the optic nerve is severed by a bistoury, the effect is  always the same, in the sense that the patient always receives a  sensation of light. To sum up, in addition to the natural excitant of  our sensory nerves, there are two which can produce the same sensory  effects, that is to say, the mechanical and the electrical excitants.  Whence it has been concluded that the peculiar nature of the sensation  felt depends much less on the nature of the excitant producing it than  on that of the sensory organ which collects it, the nerve which  propagates it, or the centre which receives it. It would perhaps be  going a little too far to affirm that the external object has no kind  of resemblance to the sensations it gives us. It is safer to say that  we are ignorant of the degree in which the two resemble or differ from  each other.    On thinking it over, it will be found that this contains a very great  mystery, for this power of distinction (_specificite_) of our nerves  is not connected with any detail observable in their structure. It is  very probably the receiving centres which are specific. It is owing to  them and to their mechanism that we ought to feel, from the same  excitant, a sensation of sound or one of colour, that is to say,  impressions which appear, when compared, as the most different in the  world. Now, so far as we can make out, the histological structure of  our auditory centre is the same as that of our visual centre. Both are  a collection of cells diverse in form, multipolar, and maintained by  a conjunctive pellicule (_stroma_). The structure of the fibres and  cells varies slightly in the motor and sensory regions, but no means  have yet been discovered of perceiving a settled difference between  the nerve-cells of the optic centre and those of the auditory centre.  There should be a difference, as our mind demands it; but our eye  fails to note it.    Let us suppose, however, that to-morrow, or several centuries hence,  an improved _technique_ should show us a material difference between  the visual and the auditory neurone. There is no absurdity in this  supposition; it is a possible discovery, since it is of the order of  material facts. Such a discovery, however, would lead us very far, for  what terribly complicates this problem is that we cannot directly know  the structure of our nervous system. Though close to us, though, so to  speak, inside us, it is not known to us otherwise than is the object  we hold in our hands, the ground we tread, or the landscape which  forms our horizon.    For us it is but a sensation, a real sensation when we observe it in  the dissection of an animal, or the autopsy of one of our own kind; an  imaginary and transposed sensation, when we are studying anatomy by  means of an anatomical chart; but still a sensation. It is by the  intermediary of our nervous system that we have to perceive and  imagine what a nervous system is like; consequently we are ignorant as  to the modification impressed on our perceptions and imaginations by  this intermediary, the nature of which we are unable to grasp.    Therefore, when we attempt to understand the inmost nature of the  outer world, we stand before it as before absolute darkness. There  probably exists in nature, outside of ourselves, neither colour,  odour, force, resistance, space, nor anything that we know as  sensation. Light is produced by the excitement of the optic nerve, and  it shines only in our brain; as to the excitement itself, there is  nothing to prove that it is luminous; outside of us is profound  darkness, or even worse, since darkness is the correlation of light.  In the same way, all the sonorous excitements which assail us, the  creakings of machines, the sounds of nature, the words and cries of  our fellows are produced by excitements of our acoustic nerve; it is  in our brain that noise is produced, outside there reigns a dead  silence. The same may be said of all our other senses.    Not one of our senses, absolutely none, is the revealer of external  reality. From this point of view there is no higher and no lower  sense. The sensations of sight, apparently so objective and so  searching, no more take us out of ourselves than do the sensations of  taste which are localised in the tongue.    In short, our nervous system, which enables us to communicate with  objects, prevents us, on the other hand, from knowing their nature. It  is an organ of relation with the outer world; it is also, for us, a  cause of isolation. We never go outside ourselves. We are walled in.  And all we can say of matter and of the outer world is, that it is  revealed to us solely by the sensations it affords us, that it is the  unknown cause of our sensations, the inaccessible excitant of our  organs of the senses, and that the ideas we are able to form as to the  nature and the properties of that excitant, are necessarily derived  from our sensations, and are subjective to the same degree as those  sensations themselves.    But we must make haste to add that this point of view is the one which  is reached when we regard the relations of sensation with its unknown  cause the great _X_ of matter.[7] Positive science and practical life  do not take for an objective this relation of sensation with the  Unknowable; they leave this to metaphysics. They distribute themselves  over the study of sensation and examine the reciprocal relations of  sensations with sensations. Those last, condemned as misleading  appearances when we seek in them the expression of the Unknowable,  lose this illusory character when we consider them in their reciprocal  relations. Then they constitute for us reality, the whole of reality  and the only object of human knowledge. The world is but an assembly  of present, past, and possible sensations; the affair of science is to  analyse and co-ordinate them by separating their accidental from their  constant relations.
