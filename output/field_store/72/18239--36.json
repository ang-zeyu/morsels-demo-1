On the  other side I shall be joined by friends, if need be.\"    Pedro ceased, and rekindled his cigarette, which had gone out during the  explanation.    \"I will go with you,\" said Lawrence, with decision, as he extended his  hand.    \"Good,\" replied Pedro, grasping it with a hearty squeeze; \"now I shall  have no fears for our little Indian, for robbers are cowards as a rule.\"    \"Have we, then, much chance of meeting with robbers?\"    \"Well, I should say we have little chance of altogether escaping them,  for in times of war there are always plenty of deserters and other  white-livered scoundrels who seize the opportunity to work their will.  Besides, there are some noted outlaws in the neighbourhood of the pass  we are going to cross.  There's Conrad of the Mountains, for instance.  You've heard of him?\"    \"No, never.\"    \"Ah, senhor, that proves you to be a stranger here, for his name is  known from the Atlantic to the Pacific--chiefly, however, on the east  side of the Cordillera, and on the Pampas.  He is an outlaw--at least he  is said to be so; but one cannot believe all one hears.  Some say that  he is cruel, others that he is ferocious among men, but never hurts  women or children.\"    \"Well, it is to be hoped we may not fall in with him, or any of his  band,\" said Lawrence; \"for it is better to hear of his qualities than to  put them to the test.\"    \"Yet, methinks,\" resumed Pedro, \"if you fell in with him alone you  should have no cause to fear him, for you must be more than his match.\"    \"I don't think I should fear him,\" returned Lawrence, with a simple  look.  \"As to being more than his match, I know not, for my spirit does  not prompt me to light, and I cannot boast of much capacity in the use  of arms--unless you count my good oak-cudgel a weapon.  I have acquired  some facility in the use of that, having practised singlestick as an  amusement at school.\"    As he spoke, the youth was surprised and somewhat startled by his  companion suddenly drawing a pistol from his belt, and pointing it  steadily at the open doorway of the hut.  Turning his eyes quickly in  that direction, he beheld, with increased astonishment, a pair of  glaring eyes, two rows of glittering teeth, and a pair of thick red  lips!  The flesh which united these striking objects was all but  invisible, by reason of its being nearly as black as its background.    Most eyes, if human, would have got away from a pistol's line of fire  with precipitancy, but the eyes referred to did not disappear.  On the  contrary, they paid no regard whatever to the owner of the pistol, but  continued to glare steadily at Lawrence Armstrong.  Seeing this, Pedro  hesitated to pull the trigger.  He was quick to defend himself, but not  prompt to kill.  When he saw that the eyes slowly advanced out of the  gloom, that they with the lips and teeth belonged to a negro who  advanced into the room unarmed and with outspread hands, he quietly  lowered his weapon, and glanced at Lawrence.  No doubt Pedro felt, as he  certainly looked, perplexed, when he observed that Lawrence returned the  intruder's gaze with almost equal intensity.    Suddenly the negro sprang towards the Englishman.  He was a short,  thick-set, and exceedingly powerful man; yet Lawrence made no move to  defend himself.    \"Quashy!\" he exclaimed, as the black fell on his knees, seized one of  his hands, and covered it with kisses, at the same time bursting into  tears.    \"Oh! massa Lawrie--oh! massa Lawrie, why you no come sooner?  Why you so  long?  De sodger brutes nebber dar to touch de ole house if you was  dere.  Oh!  Massa Lawrie, you's too late--too late!--My! how you's  growed!\"    In the midst of his sobs the young negro, for he was little more than a  youth, drew back his head to obtain a better view of his old companion  and playmate.    Need we say that Lawrence reciprocated the affection of the man?    \"He was a boy like myself when I was here,\" said Lawrence in explanation  to the amused Peruvian.  \"His father was one of my father's most  attached servants, whom he brought from Kentucky on his way to this  land, and to whom he gave his freedom.  Quashy himself used to be my  playmate.--But tell me about the attack on the mill, Quash.  Were you  present?\"    \"Prisint!  You bery sure I was, an' I poke some holes in de varmints  'fore dey hoed away.\"    \"And how did you escape, Quash?  Come, sit down and tell me all about  it.\"    The negro willingly complied.  Meanwhile the Indian girl, who had been  roused by his sudden entrance, resumed her seat on the saddle, and,  looking intently into his black face, seemed to try to gather from the  expression of his features something of what he said.    We need not repeat the story.  It was a detailed account of murder and  destruction; the burning of the place and the scattering of the old  servants.  Fortunately Lawrence had no relatives to deplore.    \"But don't you know where any of the household have gone?\" he asked,  when the excited negro paused to recover breath.    \"Don't know nuffin'.  Arter I poke de holes in de scoundrils, I was  'bleeged to bolt.  When I come back, de ole house was in flames, an'  eberybody gone--what wasn't dead.  I hollered--ay, till I was a'most  busted--but nobody reply.  Den I bury de dead ones, an' I've hoed about  eber since slobberin' an' wringin' my hands.\"    \"Was our old clerk among the slain?\" asked Lawrence.    \"No, massa, but I tinks he's a dead one now, for he too ole to run far.\"    \"And I suppose you can't even guess where any of those who escaped went  to?\"    \"Couldn't guess more nor a Red Injin's noo-born babby.\"    \"Quashy,\" said Lawrence in a low voice, \"be careful how you speak of  Indians.\"    He glanced, as he spoke, at Manuela, who now sat with grave face and  downcast eyes, having apparently found that the human countenance,  however expressive, failed to make up for the want of language.    And, truly, Quashy's countenance was unwontedly mobile and expressive.  Every feature seemed to possess the power of independently betraying the  thoughts and feelings of the man, so that when they all united for that  end the effect was marvellous.  Emotional, and full of quick sympathy,  Quashy's visage changed from grave to gay, pitiful to fierce, humorous  to savage, at a moment's notice.  When, therefore, he received the  gentle rebuke above referred to, his animated countenance assumed a  sudden aspect of utter woe and self-condemnation that may be conceived  but cannot be described, and when Lawrence gave vent to a short laugh at  the unexpected change, Quashy's eyes glistened with an arch look, and  his mouth expanded from ear to ear.    And what an expansion that was, to be sure! when you take into account  the display of white teeth and red gums by which it was accompanied.    \"Well, now, Quash,\" resumed Lawrence, \"what did you do after that?\"    \"Arter what, massa?\"    \"After finding that slobbering and wringing your hands did no good.\"    \"Oh! arter dat, I not know what to do, an' den I tried to die--I _was_  so mis'rable.  But I couldn't.  You've no notion how hard it is to die  when you wants to.  Anyhow I couldn't manage it, so I gib up tryin'.\"    At this point Manuela rose, and, bidding Pedro good-night in the Indian  tongue, passed into her little chamber and shut the door.    \"And what do you intend to do now, Quash?\" asked Lawrence.    \"Stick to you, massa, troo t'ick an' t'in,\" returned the negro with  emphatic promptitude, which caused even Pedro to laugh.    \"My poor fellow, that is impossible,\" said Lawrence, who then explained  his position and circumstances, showing how it was that he had little  money and no immediate prospect of obtaining any,--that, in short, he  was about to start out in the wide world friendless and almost penniless  to seek his fortune.  To all of which the negro listened with a face so  utterly devoid of expression of any kind that his old master and  playmate could not tell how he took it.    \"And now,\" he asked in conclusion, \"what say you to all that?\"    \"Stick to you troo t'ick and t'in,\" repeated Quashy, in a tone of what  might be styled sulky firmness.    \"But,\" said Lawrence, \"I can't pay you any wages.\"    \"Don' want no wages,\" said Quashy.    \"Besides,\" resumed Lawrence, \"even if I were willing to take you, Senhor  Pedro might object.\"    \"I no care for Senhor Pedro one brass buttin,\" retorted the negro.    The Peruvian smiled rather approvingly at this candid expression of  opinion.    \"Where you gwine?\" asked Quashy, abruptly.    \"To Buenos Ayres.\"    \"I's gwine to Bens Airies too.  I's a free nigger, an' no mortial man  kin stop me.\"    As Quashy remained obdurate, and, upon consultation, Lawrence and Pedro  came to the conclusion that such a sturdy, resolute fellow might be  rather useful in the circumstances, it was finally arranged, to the poor  fellow's inexpressible delight, that he should accompany them in their  long journey to the far east.        CHAPTER THREE.    LINGUAL DIFFICULTIES ACCOMPANIED BY PHYSICAL DANGERS AND FOLLOWED BY THE  ADVENT OF BANDITTI.    After several days had passed away, our travellers found themselves  among the higher passes of the great mountain range of the Andes.    Before reaching that region, however, they had, in one of the villages  through which they passed, supplied themselves each with a fresh stout  mule, besides two serviceable animals to carry their provisions and camp  equipage.    Pedro, who of course rode ahead in the capacity of guide, seemed to  possess an unlimited supply of cash, and Lawrence Armstrong had at least  sufficient to enable him to bear his fair share of the expenses of the  journey.  As for Quashy, being a servant he had no expenses to bear.    Of course the finest, as well as the best-looking, mule had been given  to the pretty Manuela, and, despite the masculine attitude of her  position, she sat and managed her steed with a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],[0,"Battles with the Sea (#4)"],[1," be done?  Were the Shingles to be forsaken, when possibly human beings were  perishing there?  There was no help for it.  The steamer and lifeboat  made for the vessels that were signalling, and as the exhausted crew on  the quivering mast of the Demerara saw their lights depart, the last  hope died out of their breasts.    \"Hope thou in God, for thou shalt yet praise Him,\" perchance occurred to  some of them: who knows?    Meanwhile the rescuers made for the Prince's lightship and were told  that a vessel in distress was signalling on the higher part of the  Girdler Sands.    Away they went again, and this time were successful.  They made for the  Girdler lightship, and on the Girdler Sands they found the Fusilier.    The steamer towed the lifeboat to windward of the wreck into such a  position that when cast adrift she could bear down on her.  Then the  cable was slipped and the boat went in for her own special and hazardous  work.  Up went her little foresail close-reefed, and she rushed into a  sea of tumultuous broken water that would have swamped any other kind of  boat in the world.    What a burst of thrilling joy and hope there was among the emigrants in  the Fusilier when the little craft was at last descried!  It was about  one o'clock in the morning by that time, and the sky had cleared a very  little, so that a faint gleam of moonlight enabled them to see the boat  of mercy plunging towards them through a very chaos of surging seas and  whirling foam.  To the rescuers the wreck was rendered clearly visible  by the lurid light of her burning tar-barrels as she lay on the sands,  writhing and trembling like a living thing in agony.  The waves burst  over her continually, and, mingling in spray with the black smoke of her  fires, swept furiously away to leeward.    At first each wave had lifted the ship and let her crash down on the  sands, but as the tide fell this action decreased, and had ceased  entirely when the lifeboat arrived.    And now the point of greatest danger was reached.  How to bring a  lifeboat alongside of a wreck so as to get the people into her without  being dashed to pieces is a difficult problem to solve.  It was no new  problem, however, to these hardy and fearless men; they had solved it  many a time, before that night.  When more than a hundred yards to  windward of the wreck, the boat's foresail was lowered and her anchor  let go.  Then they seized the oars, and the cable was payed out; but the  distance had been miscalculated.  They were twenty yards or so short of  the wreck when the cable had run completely out, so the men had to pull  slowly and laboriously back to their anchor again, while the emigrants  sent up a cry of despair, supposing they had failed and were going to  forsake them!  At length the anchor was got up.  In a few minutes it was  let go in a better position, and the boat was carefully veered down  under the lee of the vessel, from both bow and stern of which a hawser  was thrown to it and made fast.  By means of these ropes and the cable  the boat was kept somewhat in position without striking the wreck.    It was no easy matter to make the voice heard in such a gale and turmoil  of seas, but the captain of the Fusilier managed to give his ship's name  and intended destination.  Then he shouted, \"How many can you carry?  We  have more than a hundred souls on board; more than sixty of them women  and children.\"    This might well fill the breasts of the rescuers with anxiety.  Their  boat, when packed full, could only carry about thirty.  However, a  cheering reply was returned, and, seizing a favourable opportunity, two  of the boatmen sprang on the wreck, clambered over the side, and leaped  among the excited emigrants.  Some seized them by the hands and hailed  them as deliverers; others, half dead with terror, clung to them as if  afraid they might forsake them.  There was no time, however, to humour  feelings.  Shaking them all off--kindly but forcibly--the men went to  work with a will, briefly explained that there was a steamer not far  off, and began to get the women first into the boat.    Terror-stricken, half fainting, trembling in every limb, deadly pale,  and exhausted by prolonged anxiety and exposure, the poor creatures were  carried rather than led to the ship's side.  It needed courage even to  submit to be saved on such a night and in such circumstances.  Two  sailors stood outside the ship's bulwarks, fastened there by ropes,  ready to lower the women.  At one moment the raging sea rose with a roar  almost to the feet of these men, bearing the kicking lifeboat on its  crest.  Next moment the billow had passed, and the men looked down into  a yawning abyss of foam, with the boat surging away far out of their  reach, plunging and tugging at the ropes which held it, as a wild horse  of the plains might struggle with the lasso.  No wonder that the women  gazed appalled at the prospect of such a leap, or that some shrieked and  wildly resisted the kind violence of their rescuers.  But the leap was  for life; it had to be taken--and quickly, too, for the storm was very  fierce, and there were many to save!    One of the women is held firmly by the two men.  With wildly-staring  eyes she sees the boat sweep towards her on the breast of a rushing sea.  It comes closer.  Some of the men below stand up with outstretched  arms.  The woman makes a half spring, but hesitates.  The momentary  action proves almost fatal.  In an instant the boat sinks into a gulf,  sweeps away as far as the ropes will let her, and is buried in foam,  while the woman is slipping from the grasp of the men who hold her.    \"Don't let her go! don't let her go!\" is roared by the lifeboat-men, but  she has struggled out of their grasp.  Another instant and she is gone;  but God in His mercy sends the boat in again at that instant; the men  catch her as she falls, and drag her inboard.    Thus, one by one, were the women got into the lifeboat.  Some of these  women were old and infirm; some were invalids.  Who can conceive the  horror of the situation to such as these, save those who went through  it?    The children were wrapped up in blankets and thus handed down.  Some of  the husbands or fathers on board rolled up shawls and blankets and  tossed them down to the partially clothed and trembling women.  It  chanced that one small infant was bundled up in a blanket by a frantic  passenger and handed over the side.  The man who received it, mistaking  it for merely a blanket, cried, \"Here, Bill, catch!\" and tossed it into  the boat.  Bill, with difficulty, caught it as it was flying overboard;  at the same moment a woman cried, \"My child! my child!\" sprang forward,  snatched the bundle from the horrified Bill, and hugged it to her bosom!    At last the boat, being sufficiently filled, was hauled up to her  anchor.  Sail was hoisted, and away they flew into the surging darkness,  leaving the rest of the emigrants still filled with terrible anxiety,  but not now with hopeless despair.    The lifeboat and her tender work admirably together.  Knowing exactly  what must be going on, and what would be required of him, though he  could see nothing, the captain of the Aid, after the boat had slipped  from him, had run down along the sands to leeward of the wreck, and  there waited.  Presently he saw the boat coming like a phantom out of  the gloom.  It was quickly alongside, and the rescued people--  twenty-five women and children--were transferred to the steamer, taken  down to her cabin, and tenderly cared for.  Making this transfer in such  a sea was itself difficult in the extreme, and accompanied with great  danger, but difficulty and danger were the rule that night, not the  exception.  All went well.  The Aid, with the warrior-boat in tow,  steamed back to windward of the wreck; then the lifeboat slipped the  cable as before, and returned to the conflict, leaping over the seething  billows to the field of battle like a warhorse refreshed.    The stirring scene was repeated with success.  Forty women and children  were rescued on the second trip, and put on board the steamer.  Leaden  daylight now began to dawn.  Many hours had the \"storm warriors\" been  engaged in the wild exhausting fight, nevertheless a third and a fourth  time did they charge the foe, and each time with the same result.  All  the passengers were finally rescued and put on board the steamer.    But now arose a difficulty.  The tide had been falling and leaving the  wreck, so that the captain and crew determined to stick to her in the  hope of getting her off, if the gale should abate before the tide rose  again.    It was therefore agreed that the lifeboat should remain by her in case  of accidents; so the exhausted men had to prepare for a weary wait in  their wildly plunging boat, while the Aid went off with her rescued  people to Ramsgate.    But the adventures of that night were not yet over.  The tug had not  been gone above an hour and a half, when, to the surprise of those in  the lifeboat, she was seen returning, with her flag flying half mast  high, a signal of recall to her boat.  The lifeboat slipped from the  side of the wreck and ran to meet her.  The reason was soon explained.  On his way back to Ramsgate the captain had discovered another large  vessel on her beam-ends, a complete wreck, on that part of the sands  named the Shingles.  It was the Demerara, and her crew were still seen  clinging to the quivering mast on which they had spent the livelong  night.    More work for the well-nigh worn out heroes!  Away they went to the  rescue as though they had been a fresh crew.  Dashing through the surf  they drew near the doomed ship, which creaked and groaned when struck by  the tremendous seas, and threatened to go to pieces every moment.  The  sixteen men on the mast were drenched by every sea.  Several times that  awful night they had, as it were, been mocked by false hopes of"]]]
