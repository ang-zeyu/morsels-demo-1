And he made    them remain there until the colonel, seeing that the squad did not    rally, sent him an orderly, who crept by all sorts of covered ways    to reach him. This bold stand having been reported to the marshal,    he promoted him on the field to the rank of an officer, although his    order had prescribed that he should be very chary of these kinds of    promotions.\"    His physical courage shown at this age was paralleled by his moral  courage in later years. The staying power he showed in immovably  adhering to his views on evolution through many years, and under the  direct and raking fire of harsh and unrelenting criticism and ridicule  from friend and foe, affords a striking contrast to the moral timidity  shown by Buffon when questioned by the Sorbonne. We can see that Lamarck  was the stuff martyrs are made of, and that had he been tried for heresy  he would have been another Tycho Brahe.    Soon after, de Lamarck was nominated to a lieutenancy; but so glorious a  beginning of his military career was most unexpectedly checked. A sudden  accident forced him to leave the service and entirely change his course  of life. His regiment had been, during peace, sent into garrison, first  at Toulon and then at Monaco. While there a comrade in play lifted him  by the head; this gave rise to an inflammation of the lymphatic glands  of the neck, which, not receiving the necessary attention on the spot,  obliged him to go to Paris for better treatment.      \"The united efforts [says Cuvier] of several surgeons met with no    better success, and danger had become very imminent, when our    _confrere_, the late M. Tenon, with his usual sagacity, recognized    the trouble, and put an end to it by a complicated operation, of    which M. de Lamarck preserved deep scars. This treatment lasted for    a year, and, during this time, the extreme scantiness of his    resources confined him to a solitary life, when he had the leisure    to devote himself to meditations.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [1] In the little chapel next the church lies buried, we were told by  M. Duval, a Protestant of the family of de Guillebon, the purchaser  (_acquereur_) of the _chateau_. Whether the estate is now in the hands  of his heirs we did not ascertain.    [2] As stated by G. de Mortillet, the date of his birth is variously  given. Michaud's _Dictionnaire Biographique_ gives the date April 1;  other authors, April 11; others, the correct one, August 1, 1744.  (_Lamarck.

[7] The abbe attempts to answer the question as to what place gave  origin to the name of Lamarck, and says:    \"The author of the history of Bearn considered the cradle of the race to  have been the freehold of Marca, parish of Gou (Basses-Pyrenees). A  branch of the family established in le Magnoac changed its name of Marca  to that of La Marque.\" It was M. d'Ossat who gave rise to this change by  addressing his letters to M. de Marca (at the time when he was preceptor  of his nephew), sometimes under the name of M. Marca, sometimes  _M. la Marqua_, or of _M. de la Marca_, but more often still under that  of _M. de la Marque_, \"with the object, no doubt, of making him a  Frenchman\" (\"_dans la vue sans doute de le franciser_\"). (_Vie du  Cardinal d'Ossat_, tome i., p. 319.)    \"To recall their origin, the branch of Magnoac to-day write their name  _Marque-Marca_. If the Marca of the historian belongs to Bearn, the  Lamarque of the naturalist, an orthographic name in principle, proceeds  from Bigorre, actually chosen (_designee_) by _Lamarcq, Pontacq, or  Lamarque pres Bearn_. That the _Lamarque_ of the botanist of the royal  cabinet distinguished himself from all the _Lamarques_ of Bearn or of  Bigorre, which it bears (_qu'il gise_) to this day in the  Hautes-Pyrenees, Canton d'Ossun, we have many proofs: Aast at some  distance, Bourcat and Couet all near l'Abbaye Laique, etc. The village  so determined is called in turn _Marca_, _La Marque_, _Lamarque_; names  predestined to several destinations; judge then to the mercy of a  botanist, _Lamarck_, _La Marck_, _Delamarque_, _De Lamarck_, who shall  determine their number? As to the last, I only explain it by a fantasy  of the man who would de-Bigorrize himself in order to Germanize himself  in the hope, apparently, that at the first utterance of the name people  would believe that he was from the _outre Rhin_ rather than from the  borders of Gave or of Adour. Consequently a hundred times more learned  and a hundred times more worthy of a professorship in the Museum, where  Monet would seem (_entrevait_) much less than Lamarque.\"    It may be added that Bearn was an ancient province of southern France  nearly corresponding to the present Department of Basses-Pyrenees. Its  capital was Pau.    [8] We have been unable to ascertain the date when young Lamarck entered  the seminary. On making inquiries in June, 1899, at the Jesuits'  Seminary in Amiens, one of the faculty, after consultation with the  Father Superior, kindly gave us in writing the following information as  to the exact date: \"The registers of the great seminary were carried  away during the French Revolution, and we do not know whither they have  been transported, and whether they still exist to-day. Besides, it is  very doubtful whether Lamarck resided here, because only ecclesiastics  preparing for receiving orders were received in the seminary. Do you not  confound the seminary with the ancient college of Rue Poste de Paris,  college now destroyed?\"    [9] We are following the _Eloge_ of Cuvier almost verbatim, also  reproduced in the biographical notice in the _Revue biographique de la  Societe Malacologique de France_, said to have been prepared by J. R.  Bourguignat.          CHAPTER II    STUDENT LIFE AND BOTANICAL CAREER      The profession of arms had not led Lamarck to forget the principles of  physical science which he had received at college. During his sojourn at  Monaco the singular vegetation of that rocky country had attracted his  attention, and Chomel's _Traite des Plantes usuelles_ accidentally  falling into his hands had given him some smattering of botany.    Lodged at Paris, as he has himself said, in a room much higher up than  he could have wished, the clouds, almost the only objects to be seen  from his windows, interested him by their ever-changing shapes, and  inspired in him his first ideas of meteorology. There were not wanting  other objects to excite interest in a mind which had always been  remarkably active and original. He then realized, to quote from his  biographer, Cuvier, what Voltaire said of Condorcet, that solid enduring  discoveries can shed a lustre quite different from that of a commander  of a company of infantry. He resolved to study some profession. This  last resolution was but little less courageous than the first. Reduced  to a pension (_pension alimentaire_) of only 400 francs a year, he  attempted to study medicine, and while waiting until he had the time to  give to the necessary studies, he worked in the dreary office of a  bank.    The meditations, the thoughts and aspirations of a contemplative nature  like his, in his hours of work or leisure, in some degree consoled the  budding philosopher during this period of uncongenial labor, and when he  did have an opportunity of communicating his ideas to his friends, of  discussing them, of defending them against objection, the hardships of  his workaday life were for the time forgotten. In his ardor for science  all the uncongenial experiences of his life as a bank clerk vanished.  Like many another rising genius in art, literature, or science, his zeal  for knowledge and investigation in those days of grinding poverty fed  the fires of his genius, and this was the light which throughout his  long poverty-stricken life shed a golden lustre on his toilsome  existence. He did not then know that the great Linne, the father of the  science he was to illuminate and so greatly to expand, also began life  in extreme poverty, and eked out his scanty livelihood by mending over  again for his own use the cast-off shoes of his fellow-students.  (Cuvier.)    Bourguin[10] tells us that Lamarck's medical course lasted four years,  and this period of severe study--for he must have made it  such--evidently laid the best possible foundation that Paris could then  afford for his after studies. He seems, however, to have wavered in his  intentions of making medicine his life work, for he possessed a decided  taste for music. His eldest brother, the Chevalier de Bazentin, strongly  opposed, and induced him to abandon this project, though not without  difficulty.    At about this time the two brothers lived in a quiet village[11] near  Paris, and there for a year they studied together science and history.  And now happened an event which proved to be the turning point, or  rather gave a new and lasting impetus to Lamarck's career and decided  his vocation in life. In one of their walks they met the philosopher and  sentimentalist, Jean Jacques Rousseau. We know little about Lamarck's  acquaintance with this genius, for all the details of his life, both in  his early and later years, are pitifully scanty. Lamarck, however, had  attended at the Jardin du Roi a botanical course, and now, having by  good fortune met Rousseau, he probably improved the acquaintance, and,  found by Rousseau to be a congenial spirit, he was soon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2057"],[0,"The Last of the Plainsmen (#4)"],[1,"the  Colorado River. The first sight of most famous and much-heralded  wonders of nature is often disappointing; but never can this be said of  the blood-hued Rio Colorado. If it had beauty, it was beauty that  appalled. So riveted was my gaze that I could hardly turn it across the  river, where Emmett proudly pointed out his lonely home--an oasis set  down amidst beetling red cliffs. How grateful to the eye was the green  of alfalfa and cottonwood! Going round the bluff trail, the wheels had  only a foot of room to spare; and the sheer descent into the red,  turbid, congested river was terrifying.    I saw the constricted rapids, where the Colorado took its plunge into  the box-like head of the Grand Canyon of Arizona; and the deep,  reverberating boom of the river, at flood height, was a fearful thing  to hear. I could not repress a shudder at the thought of crossing above  that rapid.    The bronze walls widened as we proceeded, and we got down presently to  a level, where a long wire cable stretched across the river. Under the  cable ran a rope. On the other side was an old scow moored to the bank.    \"Are we going across in that?\" I asked Emmett, pointing to the boat.    \"We'll all be on the other side before dark,\" he replied cheerily.    I felt that I would rather start back alone over the desert than trust  myself in such a craft, on such a river. And it was all because I had  had experience with bad rivers, and thought I was a judge of dangerous  currents. The Colorado slid with a menacing roar out of a giant split  in the red wall, and whirled, eddied, bulged on toward its confinement  in the iron-ribbed canyon below.    In answer to shots fired, Emmett's man appeared on the other side, and  rode down to the ferry landing. Here he got into a skiff, and rowed  laboriously upstream for a long distance before he started across, and  then swung into the current. He swept down rapidly, and twice the skiff  whirled, and completely turned round; but he reached our bank safely.  Taking two men aboard he rowed upstream again, close to the shore, and  returned to the opposite side in much the same manner in which he had  come over.    The three men pushed out the scow, and grasping the rope overhead,  began to pull. The big craft ran easily. When the current struck it,  the wire cable sagged, the water boiled and surged under it, raising  one end, and then the other. Nevertheless, five minutes were all that  were required to pull the boat over.    It was a rude, oblong affair, made of heavy planks loosely put  together, and it leaked. When Jones suggested that we get the agony  over as quickly as possible, I was with him, and we embarked together.  Jones said he did not like the looks of the tackle; and when I thought  of his by no means small mechanical skill, I had not added a cheerful  idea to my consciousness. The horses of the first team had to be  dragged upon the scow, and once on, they reared and plunged.    When we started, four men pulled the rope, and Emmett sat in the stern,  with the tackle guys in hand. As the current hit us, he let out the  guys, which maneuver caused the boat to swing stern downstream. When it  pointed obliquely, he made fast the guys again. I saw that this served  two purposes: the current struck, slid alongside, and over the stern,  which mitigated the danger, and at the same time helped the boat across.    To look at the river was to court terror, but I had to look. It was an  infernal thing. It roared in hollow, sullen voice, as a monster  growling. It had voice, this river, and one strangely changeful. It  moaned as if in pain--it whined, it cried. Then at times it would seem  strangely silent. The current as complex and mutable as human life. It  boiled, beat and bulged. The bulge itself was an incompressible thing,  like a roaring lift of the waters from submarine explosion. Then it  would smooth out, and run like oil. It shifted from one channel to  another, rushed to the center of the river, then swung close to one  shore or the other. Again it swelled near the boat, in great, boiling,  hissing eddies.    \"Look! See where it breaks through the mountain!\" yelled Jones in my  ear.    I looked upstream to see the stupendous granite walls separated in a  gigantic split that must have been made by a terrible seismic  disturbance; and from this gap poured the dark, turgid, mystic flood.    I was in a cold sweat when we touched shore, and I jumped long before  the boat was properly moored.    Emmett was wet to the waist where the water had surged over him. As he  sat rearranging some tackle I remarked to him that of course he must be  a splendid swimmer, or he would not take such risks.    \"No, I can't swim a stroke,\" he replied; \"and it wouldn't be any use if  I could. Once in there a man's a goner.\"    \"You've had bad accidents here?\" I questioned.    \"No, not bad. We only drowned two men last year. You see, we had to tow  the boat up the river, and row across, as then we hadn't the wire. Just  above, on this side, the boat hit a stone, and the current washed over  her, taking off the team and two men.\"    \"Didn't you attempt to rescue them?\" I asked, after waiting a moment.    \"No use. They never came up.\"    \"Isn't the river high now?\" I continued, shuddering as I glanced out at  the whirling logs and drifts.    \"High, and coming up. If I don't get the other teams over to-day I'll  wait until she goes down. At this season she rises and lowers every day  or so, until June then comes the big flood, and we don't cross for  months.\"    I sat for three hours watching Emmett bring over the rest of his party,  which he did without accident, but at the expense of great effort. And  all the time in my ears dinned the roar, the boom, the rumble of this  singularly rapacious and purposeful river--a river of silt, a red river  of dark, sinister meaning, a river with terrible work to perform, a  river which never gave up its dead.        CHAPTER 2.    THE RANGE    After a much-needed rest at Emmett's, we bade good-by to him and his  hospitable family, and under the guidance of his man once more took to  the wind-swept trail. We pursued a southwesterly course now, following  the lead of the craggy red wall that stretched on and on for hundreds  of miles into Utah. The desert, smoky and hot, fell away to the left,  and in the foreground a dark, irregular line marked the Grand Canyon  cutting through the plateau.    The wind whipped in from the vast, open expanse, and meeting an  obstacle in the red wall, turned north and raced past us. Jones's hat  blew off, stood on its rim, and rolled. It kept on rolling, thirty  miles an hour, more or less; so fast, at least, that we were a long  time catching up to it with a team of horses. Possibly we never would  have caught it had not a stone checked its flight. Further  manifestation of the power of the desert wind surrounded us on all  sides. It had hollowed out huge stones from the cliffs, and tumbled  them to the plain below; and then, sweeping sand and gravel low across  the desert floor, had cut them deeply, until they rested on slender  pedestals, thus sculptoring grotesque and striking monuments to the  marvelous persistence of this element of nature.    Late that afternoon, as we reached the height of the plateau, Jones  woke up and shouted: \"Ha! there's Buckskin!\"    Far southward lay a long, black mountain, covered with patches of  shining snow. I could follow the zigzag line of the Grand Canyon  splitting the desert plateau, and saw it disappear in the haze round  the end of the mountain. From this I got my first clear impression of  the topography of the country surrounding our objective point. Buckskin  mountain ran its blunt end eastward to the Canyon--in fact, formed a  hundred miles of the north rim. As it was nine thousand feet high it  still held the snow, which had occasioned our lengthy desert ride to  get back of the mountain. I could see the long slopes rising out of the  desert to meet the timber.    As we bowled merrily down grade I noticed that we were no longer on  stony ground, and that a little scant silvery grass had made its  appearance. Then little branches of green, with a blue flower, smiled  out of the clayish sand.    All of a sudden Jones stood up, and let out a wild Comanche yell. I was  more startled by the yell than by the great hand he smashed down on my  shoulder, and for the moment I was dazed.    \"There! look! look! the buffalo! Hi! Hi! Hi!\"    Below us, a few miles on a rising knoll, a big herd of buffalo shone  black in the gold of the evening sun. I had not Jones's incentive, but  I felt enthusiasm born of the wild and beautiful picture, and added my  yell to his. The huge, burly leader of the herd lifted his head, and  after regarding us for a few moments calmly went on browsing.    The desert had fringed away into a grand rolling pastureland, walled in  by the red cliffs, the slopes of Buckskin, and further isolated by the  Canyon. Here was a range of twenty-four hundred square miles without a  foot of barb-wire, a pasture fenced in by natural forces, with the  splendid feature that the buffalo could browse on the plain in winter,  and go up into the cool foothills of Buckskin in summer.    From another ridge we saw a cabin dotting the rolling plain, and in  half an hour we reached it. As we climbed down from the wagon a brown  and black dog came dashing out of the cabin, and promptly jumped at  Moze. His selection showed poor discrimination, for Moze whipped him  before I could separate them. Hearing Jones heartily greeting some one,  I turned in his direction, only to be distracted by another dog fight.  Don had tackled Moze for the seventh time. Memory rankled in Don, and  he needed a lot of whipping, some of which he was getting when I  rescued him.    Next moment I was shaking hands with Frank and Jim, Jones's ranchmen.  At a glance I liked them both. Frank was short and wiry, and had"]]]
