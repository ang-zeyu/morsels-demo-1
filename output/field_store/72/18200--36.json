[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/209"],[0,"The Turn of the Screw (#4)"],[1,". \"You mean that a boy who never is--?\"    \"Is no boy for ME!\"    I held her tighter. \"You like them with the spirit to be naughty?\" Then,  keeping pace with her answer, \"So do I!\" I eagerly brought out. \"But not  to the degree to contaminate--\"    \"To contaminate?\"--my big word left her at a loss. I explained it. \"To  corrupt.\"    She stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd laugh.  \"Are you afraid he'll corrupt YOU?\" She put the question with such a  fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to match  her own, I gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.    But the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, I cropped up in  another place. \"What was the lady who was here before?\"    \"The last governess? She was also young and pretty--almost as young and  almost as pretty, miss, even as you.\"    \"Ah, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!\" I recollect  throwing off. \"He seems to like us young and pretty!\"    \"Oh, he DID,\" Mrs. Grose assented: \"it was the way he liked everyone!\"  She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. \"I mean  that's HIS way--the master's.\"    I was struck. \"But of whom did you speak first?\"    She looked blank, but she colored. \"Why, of HIM.\"    \"Of the master?\"    \"Of who else?\"    There was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my  impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I  merely asked what I wanted to know. \"Did SHE see anything in the boy--?\"    \"That wasn't right? She never told me.\"    I had a scruple, but I overcame it. \"Was she careful--particular?\"    Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. \"About some  things--yes.\"    \"But not about all?\"    Again she considered. \"Well, miss--she's gone. I won't tell tales.\"    \"I quite understand your feeling,\" I hastened to reply; but I thought  it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: \"Did she  die here?\"    \"No--she went off.\"    I don't know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose's that struck  me as ambiguous. \"Went off to die?\" Mrs. Grose looked straight out of  the window, but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what  young persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. \"She was taken ill,  you mean, and went home?\"    \"She was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it,  at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday,  to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We  had then a young woman--a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good  girl and clever; and SHE took the children altogether for the interval.  But our young lady never came back, and at the very moment I was  expecting her I heard from the master that she was dead.\"    I turned this over. \"But of what?\"    \"He never told me! But please, miss,\" said Mrs. Grose, \"I must get to my  work.\"          III      Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just  preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem.  We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately than ever  on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I  then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to  me should be under an interdict. I was a little late on the scene, and  I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the  inn at which the coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the  instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same  positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment,  seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had  put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for  him was swept away by his presence. What I then and there took him to  my heart for was something divine that I have never found to the same  degree in any child--his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in  the world but love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name  with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to  Bly with him I remained merely bewildered--so far, that is, as I was not  outraged--by the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room, in  a drawer. As soon as I could compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I  declared to her that it was grotesque.    She promptly understood me. \"You mean the cruel charge--?\"    \"It doesn't live an instant. My dear woman, LOOK at him!\"    She smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm. \"I assure  you, miss, I do nothing else! What will you say, then?\" she immediately  added.    \"In answer to the letter?\" I had made up my mind. \"Nothing.\"    \"And to his uncle?\"    I was incisive. \"Nothing.\"    \"And to the boy himself?\"    I was wonderful. \"Nothing.\"    She gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. \"Then I'll stand by  you. We'll see it out.\"    \"We'll see it out!\" I ardently echoed, giving her my hand to make it a  vow.    She held me there a moment, then whisked up her apron again with her  detached hand. \"Would you mind, miss, if I used the freedom--\"    \"To kiss me? No!\" I took the good creature in my arms and, after we had  embraced like sisters, felt still more fortified and indignant.    This, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall  the way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a  little distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I  accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was  under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the  far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a  great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance,  my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with  a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning.  I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I framed for the  end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me,  indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have;  but I now feel that, for weeks, the lessons must have been rather my  own. I learned something--at first, certainly--that had not been one  of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to be amused, and  even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in  a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music  of summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was  consideration--and consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap--not  designed, but deep--to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my  vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture  it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little  trouble--they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to  speculate--but even this with a dim disconnectedness--as to how the  rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might  bruise them. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as  if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the  blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and  protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take  for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden  and the park. It may be, of course, above all, that what suddenly broke  into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness--that hush in  which something gathers or crouches. The change was actually like the  spring of a beast.    In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest,  gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils,  teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final  retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this  hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all  when, as the light faded--or rather, I should say, the day lingered and  the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the  old trees--I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost with  a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity  of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself  tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my  discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving  pleasure--if he ever thought of it!--to the person to whose pressure  I had responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and  directly asked of me, and that I COULD, after all, do it proved even a  greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself, in short,  a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would  more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front  to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.    It was plump, one afternoon, in the middle of my very hour: the children  were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the thoughts  that, as I don't in the least shrink now from noting, used to be with me  in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a charming story  suddenly to meet someone. Someone would appear there at the turn of a  path and would stand before me and smile and approve. I didn't ask more  than that--I only asked that he should KNOW; and the only way to be sure  he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his handsome  face. That was exactly present to me--by which I mean the face  was--when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June  day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming  into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot--and with a shock  much greater than any vision had allowed for--was the sense that my  imagination had, in a flash,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20906"],[0,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 3, 1918 (#4)"],[1," forward, that they might touch the soil of the  freeman. And when they reached the shore, they danced and wept for joy  and kissed the earth on which they first stepped, no longer _slaves_  but _freemen_.\"[5]    Within a short time thereafter the boy whom they had left in dying  condition on the way reached them on the free soil of Canada in good  health. And Frank Taylor, the master of these fugitives, on recovering  from an attack of insanity which apparently resulted from the loss of  these slaves was persuaded by his friends to free the remaining  members of the Lightfoot family, an act which he finally performed,  enabling them after a few years to join their loved ones beyond the  borders of the land of the slave. In this way Henson became  instrumental in effecting the escape of as many as one hundred and  eighteen slaves.[6]    The next important work was the establishment of the British American  Manual Labor Institute in connection with Reverend Hiram Wilson. After  working out a tentative plan, Wilson wrote James O. Fuller, residing  in the State of New York, and interested him in the free Negroes of  Canada West. On a trip to England Mr. Fuller raised $1,500 for this  purpose. A convention of the leading refugees in Canada West was then  called to decide exactly how this money should be spent. Henson urged  that it be appropriated to the establishment of a manual labor school,  where children could be taught the elements of knowledge which are  usually the courses of a grammar school; and where the boys could be  given, in addition, the practice of some mechanic art and the girls  could be instructed in those domestic arts which are the proper  occupations of their sex. Such a school he though would so equip the  Negro youth as to enable him to take over much of the work then being  done by white teachers. This was then necessary, owing to the  prejudice arising against the coeducation of the whites and blacks and  the stigma attached to teachers of Negroes. For this purpose two  hundred acres of land were bought on the river Sydenham. In 1842 the  school was established at Dawn, to which Henson moved with his family.  Henson traveled in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine in  the interest of the institution and obtained many gifts, especially  from Boston, the liberal people of which gave him sufficient funds to  maintain it some time.    In connection with this school there was established a saw-mill, the  building and the equipment of which was secured by Henson also from  philanthropists in Boston. These gentlemen were Rev. Ephraim Peabody,  Amos Lawrence, H. Ingersoll Bowditch, and Samuel Elliot. Henson then  proceeded to have walnut sawed in Canada and shipped to Boston. He  sold his first eighty thousand feet to Jonas Chickering, at forty-five  dollars a thousand. The second cargo was shipped to Boston via the St.  Lawrence and brought Henson a handsome profit. This business not only  became profitable to the persons directly interested in it but proved  to be an asset of the whole section.    In the course of time, however, the institution became heavily  indebted and some means of relief had to be found. At a meeting of the  trustees it was decided to separate the management of the mill from  that of the school. It was easy to find some one to take over the  school, but few dared to think of assuming the management of the mill,  which was indebted to the amount of seven thousand five hundred  dollars. Henson accepted the management of the latter on the condition  that Peter B. Smith would assume an equal share of the responsibility.  Henson then proceeded to England to raise funds to pay the debts of  the mill. Well supplied with letters of recommendation from some of  the most prominent men in the United States, he easily connected with  men of the same class in England. But before he could raise more than  seventeen hundred dollars, an enemy, jealous of his success,  circulated through the press the report that he was an imposter and  was not authorized to solicit funds for any such purpose.[7] This, of  course, frustrated his plans, but the English people were kind to him.  They sent an agent, John Scobell, to Canada to inquire into the  matter, Henson accompanying him. A thorough investigation of the  affairs of the institution was made and the charges were repudiated.  The person who circulated them even denied that he had done so. Upon  returning to England Mr. Scobell informed Henson that should he ever  desire to return to England, he would find in the hands of Amos  Lawrence, of Boston, a draft to cover his expenses. Henson did return  in 1851 and raised sufficient money to cancel the entire indebtedness  of the institution. He was compelled to return to Canada soon after  his arrival, however, on account of the fatal illness of his wife, who  passed away in 1852.    How Father Henson claimed to be the original Uncle Tom of Mrs. Stowe's  immortal story is more than interesting. Laboring in the anti-slavery  cause, Henson traveled in Canada and New England, where he was  welcomed to the pulpits of ministers of all denominations. Once when  he was in the vicinity of Andover, Massachusetts, Mrs. Stowe sent for  him and his traveling companion, Mr. George Clarke, a white gentleman  promoting the abolition of slavery by singing at anti-slavery  meetings. Mrs. Stowe became deeply interested in Henson's story and  had him narrate in detail the many varied experiences of his eventful  life. He told her, moreover, about the life of the slave in several  sections and the peculiarities of many slaveholders. Soon thereafter  appeared \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" Henson said that the white slaves,  George and Eliza Harris, were his particular friends. Harris's real  name was Lewis Clark, who traveled and lectured with Henson in New  England. Clark and his wife lived in Canada and finally moved to  Oberlin to educate their children. Furthermore, Henson says there was  on his plantation a clear-minded, sharp Negro girl, Dinah, who was  almost like Mrs. Stowe's Topsy and that a gentleman Mr. St. Clair  lived in his neighborhood. Bryce Litton, who broke Henson's arms and  so maimed him for life that he could never thereafter touch the top of  his head, he thought, would well represent Mrs. Stowe's cruel Legree.  It has been denied that he was this hero.    When Henson was in England he had the good fortune to exhibit at the  World's Fair there some of his beautifully polished walnut lumber,  which Mr. Jonas Chickering sent over for him. The only exhibitor of  color, he attracted attention from many, among whom was Queen  Victoria, who in passing by was saluted by Henson, which salutation  was returned. She inquired as to whether the exhibit he had charge of  was his work. At the close of the exhibition Henson received a large  quarto bound volume describing the exhibits and listing the  exhibitors, among whom was found Josiah Henson. In addition he was  awarded a bronze medal, a beautiful picture of the Queen and royal  family of life size and several other objects of interest.    While in England Henson had the privilege of meeting some of its most  distinguished citizens. He introduced himself to the thinkers of the  country when, upon hearing an eminent man from Pennsylvania tell the  Sabbath-School Union that all classes in the United States  indiscriminately enjoyed religious instruction. Henson demanded a  hearing and successfully refuted the misrepresentation. Having a  standing invitation, he dined alternately with Samuel Morley and  George Hitchcock, Esq., of St. Paul's Church Yard. Upon meeting Lord  Grey, Henson was asked by the gentleman to go to India to introduce  the culture of cotton, promising him an appointment to an office  paying a handsome salary. Through Samuel Guerney, Henson had a long  interview with the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was so impressed with  Henson's bearing and culture that he inquired as to the university  from which he was graduated. Henson replied, _The University of  Adversity_. After listening to Henson's experiences for more than an  hour he followed him to the door and begged him to come to see him  again. He then attended a large picnic of Sabbath-School teachers on  the grounds of Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister of England.  Sitting down to dinner, Henson was given the seat of honor at the head  of the table with such guests as Reverend William Brock, Honorable  Samuel M. Peto and Mr. Bess.    Near the end of his career Henson had many things to trouble him. The  divided management of the British American Manual Labor Institute and  the saw-mill proved a failure. The trustees who got control of it  promised to make something new of it but did not administer the  affairs successfully and they were involved in law suits there with  the Negroes, who endeavored to obtain control of it. It finally  failed, despite the fact that the court of chancery appointed a new  board of trustees and granted a bill to incorporate the institution as  Wilberforce University, which existed a few years.    Henson showed his patriotism in serving as captain to the second Essex  company of colored volunteers in the Canadian Rebellion, going to the  aid of the government which gave them asylum from slavery. His company  held Fort Maiden from Christmas until the following May and also took  the schooner _Ann_ with three hundred arms and two cannons, musketry  and provisions for the rebel troops. They held the fort until they  were relieved by the colonel of the 44th regiment from England. Then  came the Civil War. Henson was too old to go, but his relatives  enlisted. He was charged with having violated the foreign enlistment  act and was arrested and acquitted after some harrowing experiences.    Henson made a third trip to England near the close of his career. Many  of his friends had passed away, but he met his old supporter, Samuel  Morley. He made the"]]]
