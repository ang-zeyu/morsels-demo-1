The mystic philosopher  Vladimir Solovieff used to dream of the union of the churches with the  Pope as the spiritual head, and democracy in the Russian sense as the  broad basis of the rejuvenated Christendom. Dostoyevsky, a writer most  sensitive to the claims of nationality in Russia, defined the ideal of  the Russians in a celebrated speech as the embodiment of a universally  humanitarian type. These are extremes, but characteristic extremes  pointing to the trend of national thought. Russia is so huge and so  strong that material power has ceased to be attractive to her thinkers.  But we need not yet retire into the desert and deliver ourselves to be  bound hand and foot by civilized Germans. Russia also wields a sword--a  charmed sword, blunt in an unrighteous cause, but sharp enough in the  defense of right and freedom. And this war is indeed our  \"Befreiungskrieg.\" The Slavs must have their chance in the history of  the world, and the date of their coming of age will mark a new departure  in the growth of civilization.    Yours truly,    PAUL VINOGRADOFF.    Court Place, Iffley, Oxford.          Russian Appeal for the Poles    By A. Konovalov of the Russian Duma.    [A Letter to the Russkia Vedomosti, No. 231, P. 2, Oct. 8, 1914.]      The population of Poland has been forced to experience the first  horrible onslaught of the wrathful enemy. All points within the sphere  of the German offensive offer a picture of utter desolation. The people  are fleeing in horror before the advancing enemy, leaving their homes  and their property to sure destruction. An uninterrupted line of arson  fire shines on the sorrowful path of the exiles. Their fields have been  devastated and furrowed by the trenches, their animals have been taken  away, their savings have been wasted, and all their chattels destroyed.  The prosperity of millions has been destroyed and men have been turned  into homeless beggars without a morsel of bread.    The flight of these people is beyond description. One cannot fail to  realize the stupefying horrors of such a deep and overwhelming national  calamity. The strokes of fate have come down upon the people of Poland  with a most merciless cruelty. Shall we gaze upon these horrors with  indifference? Can the Russian people remain neutral witnesses of the  sufferings and privations thrust upon the population of the devastated  country?    The Russians are making heavy sacrifices for the war, but in these  historic days we must speed up our energies still more, we must double  and treble our sacrifices. Let us not forget that despite all our  sacrifices, despite all our sorrow and alarm we are not deprived of  peaceful work, we have not been drawn into destruction as the people of  Poland have been. Without further delay we have to hasten to their aid.    A widely organized social aid must be brought to the fleeing people. We  must provide them with shelter and food. These victims are flocking to  the central provinces of Russia, to Moscow, and they must be assisted up  to the time when they shall be able to return to their country. It is  necessary to ascertain the degree of their distress and to help to  provide them with the necessities of life in places already cleared from  the enemy by the aggressiveness of the Russian Army.    Of course, the main duty in the regaining of the prosperity of Poland  lies with the Government. Only the Government is able to stand the  expense of millions required for this task, only the State through its  legislative organs is capable of creating the social, economic, and  political conditions making possible the reconstruction of the  civilization of Poland. But we also owe a duty of help, a sacred duty of  immediate sympathy to those stricken with disaster.    To carry out our task we need funds. In submitting this problem to the  Russian people, in calling upon it for the solution of this tremendous  and pressing issue, as far as possible, I herewith forward my little  contribution of 10,000 rubles for aid to the people of Poland suffering  from war.    A. KONOVALOV,    Member of the Duma.    Moscow, Oct. 7, (20,) 1914.    Note.--Konovalov's appeal met with a most generous response. Not only  individuals and charitable associations came forward with funds and  food, but a large number of Russian cities organized permanent aid  committees for the benefit of the war victims in Poland. Street and  house-to-house collections were organized, and considerable funds have  already been collected. Not only Russians, but also the Armenians, the  Jews, and other nationalities of Russia have shown a deep and  substantial sympathy for the Poles.    Prince Trubetskoi's appeal emphasized the political side of this  campaign of succor, while Mr. Konovalov has given prominence to the  human side of it. Prince Trubetskoi's appeal follows.          I AM FOR PEACE!    By LURANA SHELDON.          I am of New England! A daughter of mountains,      Wide-stretching fields, broad rivers that smile      With the sun on their breasts. I am of the hills--      The great, bald hills where the cattle roam.      The peace of the valleys still clings and thrills,      And the joy of the tinkling fountains,      Where the deep-creviced boulders pile.      I am of it, New England, my home!        The tenure of conflicts, the feeble thriving,      Are lore of the past. Now the giant peaks      May sleep and sleep. Their watch is ended.      The beacon towers may crumble and fall.      So well have my people defended--      So well have they prospered through striving--      Today her triumph New England speaks      In the mantling calm that envelops all.        They have come to New England, the woeful invaders.      The hills attracted, the valleys lured;      They have sowed their seeds of disturbance and fear.      They wrought for destruction, but all in vain.      They were told that order was master here.      The hills turned censors, the streams, upbraiders.      No war of men should be fought, endured!      They need wage no battle for peace again!        Like my native hills, my strife is ended;      Like my sleeping hills, I have earned life's calm.      The sun that smiles on New England's streams      Bids human conflicts forever cease.      Let those who must, writhe in their dreams      At thought of days with horror blended.      For me, the meadow's gentle balm--      I am of New England--where all is peace!          United Russia    By Peter Struve.    [From The London Times.]         Prof. Peter Struve, editor of the monthly, Russian Thought, is       recognized as one of the most acute political thinkers in       Europe. He was one of the chief founders of the Constitutional       Democratic Party (the Cadets) and was member for St.       Petersburg in the Second Duma. He is also known as an       economist of great erudition.      PETROGRAD, Sept. 16.    The future historian will note with astonishment that official Germany,  when she declared war on Russia, was in no way informed of the state of  public opinion in our country.    This is all the more astonishing because not a single country to the  west of Russia maintains so close a communication with Russia as  Germany. The Germans, better than other peoples, could and should have  known Russia and her material resources, her internal state, and her  moral condition. When she declared war on Russia, Germany evidently  counted, above all, on the weakness of the Russian Army. There was  nothing, however, to justify such an estimate of the armed forces of  Russia. Certainly Russia had been beaten in the Japanese war, but in  that war the decision was reached on the sea, and after the fall of Port  Arthur the land war had no object. The Germans have probably convinced  themselves already how superficial was such an estimate of the forces of  Russia, but in reality their mistake was due to an entirely superficial  view of the national culture of Russia and an extremely elementary idea  of our internal development. The Germans did not believe that there is  in Russia a genuine and growing national civilization, and did not  understand that the liberation movement in Russia had not only not  shaken the power of the Russian State, but had, on the contrary,  increased it.    Not understanding this, they thought that any blow from outside would  tumble over the Russian State like a rotten tree. German aggression, on  the contrary, united the whole population of Russia, and by this alone  strengthened a hundredfold her external power. This, of course, would  have been the natural effect of any attack from without upon any sound  people or any State that was not in decomposition. But in this case  there was something else. Such a war as this could not fail to take on  at once the character both of a world war and of a national war. That is  why in this struggle with Germany and Austria-Hungary, elemental forces  united in one impulse and spirit both the Russian Radicals, with their  tendency to cosmopolitanism, and the extreme Nationalist Conservatives.  Nay, more than that, all the races of Russia understood that a challenge  had been thrown out to Russia by Germany that morally compelled her, in  the interests of the whole and of the various parts, to forget for the  time all quarrels and grievances.    This showed itself in the most natural and inevitable way with the  Poles, of whose national culture Germanism is the sworn foe. The  well-known manifesto of the Commander in Chief did not awake this  feeling among the Poles of Russia, but simply met it and gave it  support. Equally natural and elemental was the patriotic outburst that  spread among the Jews of Russia. In their case the political and social  Radicalism which we always find in the Jews turned by some sound  instinct against German militarism, which had shown itself the chief  cause and occasion of a world"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18891"],[0,"Dot and the Kangaroo (#4)"],[1,"drink.    That evening the Kangaroo tried to persuade Dot to eat some grass, but  as Dot said she had never eaten grass, it got some roots from a friendly  Bandicoot, which the little girl ate because she was hungry; but she  thought she wouldn't like to be a Bandicoot always to eat such food.  Then in a nice dry cave she nestled into the fur of the gentle Kangaroo,  and was so tired that she slept immediately.    She only woke up once. She had been dreaming that she was at home, and  was playing with the new little Calf that had come the day before she  was lost, and she couldn't remember, at first waking, what had happened,  or where she was. It was dark in the cave, and outside the bushes and  trees looked quite black--for there was but little light in that place  from the starry sky. It seemed terribly lonesome and wild. When the  Kangaroo spoke she remembered everything, and they both sat up and  talked a little.    \"Mo-poke! mo-poke!\" sang the Nightjar in the distance. \"I wish the  Nightjar wouldn't make that noise when one wants to sleep,\" said the  Kangaroo. \"It hasn't got any voice to speak of, and the tune is stupid.  It gives me the jim-jams, for it reminds me I've lost my baby kangaroo.  There is something wrong about some birds that think themselves  musical,\" she continued: \"they are well behaved and considerate enough  in the day, but as soon as it is a nice, quiet, calm night, or a bit of  a moon is in the sky, they make night hideous to everyone within  earshot--'Mo-poke! mo-poke!' Oh! it gives me the blues!\"    As the Kangaroo spoke she hopped to the front of the cave.    \"I say, Nightjar,\" she said, \"I'm a little sad to-night, please go and  sing elsewhere.\"    \"Ah!\" said the Nightjar, \"I'm so glad I've given you deliciously dismal  thoughts with my song! I'm a great artist, and can touch all hearts.  That is my mission in the world: when all the bush is quiet, and  everyone has time to be miserable, I make them more so--isn't it lovely  to be like that?\"    \"I'd rather you sang something cheerful,\" said the Kangaroo to herself,  but out loud she said, \"I find it really too beautiful, it is more than  I can bear. Please go a little farther off.\"    \"Mo-poke! mo-poke!\" croaked the Nightjar, farther and farther in the  distance, as it flew away.    \"What a pity!\" said the Kangaroo, as she returned to the cave, \"the  'possum made that unlucky joke of telling the Nightjar it has a touching  voice, and can sing: everyone has to suffer for that joke of the  'possum's. It doesn't matter to him, for he is awake all night, but it  is too bad for his neighbours who want to sleep.\"    Just then there arose from the bush a shrill wailing and shrieking that  made Dot's heart stop with fear. It sounded terrible, as if something  was wailing in great pain and suffering.    \"O Kangaroo!\" she cried, \"what is the matter?\" \"That,\" said the  Kangaroo, as she laid herself down to rest, \"is the sound of the Curlew  enjoying itself. They are sociable birds, and entertain a great deal.  There is a party to-night, I suppose, and that is the expression of  their enjoyment. I believe,\" she continued, with a suppressed yawn,  \"it's not so painful as it sounds. Willy Wagtail, who goes a great deal  amongst Humans, says they do that sort of thing also; he has often heard  them when he lived near the town.\"    Dot had never been in the town, but she was certain she had never heard  anything like the Curlew's wailing in her home; and she wondered what  Willy Wagtail meant, but she was too sleepy to ask; so she nestled a  little closer to the Kangaroo, and with the shrieking of the Curlews,  and the mournful note of the distant mo-poke in her ears, she fell  asleep again.          CHAPTER III      When Dot awoke, she did so with a start of fear. Something in her sleep  had seemed to tell her that she was in danger. At a first glance she saw  that the Kangaroo had left her, and coiled upon her body was a young  black Snake. Before Dot could move, she heard a voice from a tree,  outside the cave, say, very softly, \"Don't be afraid! keep quite still,  and you will not get hurt. Presently I'll kill that Snake. If I tried to  do so now it might bite you; so let it sleep on.\"    She looked up in the direction of the tree, and saw a big Kookooburra  perched on a bough, with all the creamy feathers of its breast fluffed  out, and its crest very high. The Kookooburra is one of the jolliest  birds in the bush, and is always cracking jokes, and laughing, but this  one was keeping as quiet as he could. Still he could not be quite  serious, and a smile played all round his huge beak. Dot could see that  he was nearly bursting with suppressed laughter. He kept on saying,  under his breath, \"what a joke this is! what a capital joke! How they'll  all laugh when I tell them.\" Just as if it was the funniest thing in the  world to have a Snake coiled up on one's body; when the horrid thing  might bite one with its poisonous fangs, at any moment!    Dot said she didn't see any joke, and it was no laughing matter.    \"To be sure _you_ don't see the joke,\" said the jovial bird. \"On-lookers  always see the jokes, and I'm an on-looker. It's not to be expected of  you, because you're not an on-looker;\" and he shook with suppressed  laughter again.    \"Where is my dear Kangaroo?\" asked Dot.    \"She has gone to get you some berries for breakfast,\" said the  Kookooburra, \"and she asked me to look after you, and that's why I'm  here. That Snake got on you whilst I flew away to consult my doctor, the  White Owl, about the terrible indigestion I have. He's very difficult  to catch awake; for he's out all night and sleepy all day. He says  cockchafers have caused it. The horny wing-cases and legs are most  indigestible, he assures me. I didn't fancy them much when I ate them  last night, so I took his advice and coughed them up, and I'm no longer  feeling depressed. Take my advice, and don't eat cockchafers, little  Human.\"    Dot did not really hear all this, nor heed the excellent advice of the  Kookooburra, not to eat those hard green beetles that had disagreed with  it, for a little shivering movement had gone through the Snake, and  presently all the scales of its shining black back and rosy underpart  began to move. Dot felt quite sick, as she saw the reptile begin to  uncoil itself, as it lay upon her. She hardly dared to breathe, but lay  as still as if she were dead, so as not to frighten or anger the horrid  creature, which presently seemed to slip like a slimy cord over her bare  legs, and wriggled away to the entrance of the cave.    With a quick, delighted movement, she sat up, eager to see where the  deadly Snake would go. It was very drowsy, having slept heavily on Dot's  warm little body; so it went slowly towards the bush, to get some frogs  or birds for breakfast. But as it wriggled into the warm morning  sunlight outside, Dot saw a sight that made her clap her hands together  with anxiety for the life of the jolly Kookooburra.    No sooner did the black Snake get outside the cave, than she saw the  Kookooburra fall like a stone from its branch, right on top of the  Snake. For a second, Dot thought the bird must have tumbled down dead,  it was such a sudden fall; but a moment later she saw it flutter on the  ground, in battle with the poisonous reptile, whilst the Snake wriggled,  and coiled its body into hoops and rings. The Kookooburra's strong  wings, beating the air just above the writhing Snake, made a great  noise, and the serpent hissed in its fierce hatred and anger. Then Dot  saw that the Kookooburra's big beak had a firm hold of the Snake by the  back of the neck, and that it was trying to fly upwards with its enemy.  In vain the dreadful creature tried to bite the gallant bird; in vain it  hissed and stuck out its wicked little spiky tongue; in vain it tried to  coil itself round the bird's body; the Kookooburra was too strong and  too clever to lose its hold, or to let the Snake get power over it.    At last Dot saw that the Snake was getting weaker and weaker, for,  little by little, the Kookooburra was able to rise higher with it, until  it reached the high bough. All the time the Snake was held in the bird's  beak, writhing and coiling in agony; for he knew that the Kookooburra  had won the battle. But, when the noble bird had reached its perch, it  did a strange thing; for it dropped the Snake right down to the ground.  Then it flew down again, and brought the reptile back to the bough, and  dropped it once more--and this it did many times. Each time the Snake  moved less and less, for its back was being broken by these falls. At  last the Kookooburra flew up with its victim for the last time, and,  holding it on the branch with its foot, beat the serpent's head with  its great strong beak. Dot could hear the blows fall,--whack, whack,  whack,--as the beak smote the Snake's head; first on one side, then on  the other, until it lay limp and dead across the bough.    \"Ah! ah! ah!--Ah! ah! ah!\" laughed the Kookooburra, and said to Dot,  \"Did you see all that? Wasn't it a joke? What a capital joke! Ha! ha!  ha! ha! ha! Oh! oh! oh! how my sides do ache! What a joke! How they'll  laugh when I tell them.\" Then came a great flight of kookooburras, for  they had heard the laughter, and all wanted to know what the joke was.  Proudly the Kookooburra told them all about the Snake sleeping on Dot,  and the great fight! All the time, first one kookooburra, and then  another, chuckled over the story, and when it came to an end every bird  dropped its wings, cocked up its tail, and throwing back its head,  opened its great beak, and all laughed uproariously together. Dot was  nearly deafened by the noise; for some chuckled, some cackled; some  said, \"Ha! ha! ha!\" others said, \"Oh! oh! oh!\" and as soon as one left  off, another began, until it seemed as though they couldn't stop. They  all said it was a splendid joke, and that they"]]]
