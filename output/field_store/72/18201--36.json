HERODOTUS         Born in Asia Minor, probably in 484 B.C.; died in Italy,       probably in 424; commonly called the \"Father of History\";       assisted in the expulsion of the tyrant Lygdamis from       Halicarnassus; traveled in Persia, Egypt, and Greece; lived       afterward in Samos and Athens, settling in Thurii, Italy,       about 444 B.C.; his history of the Persian invasion of       Greece, extending to 479 B.C., was first printed in Greek by       Aldus Manutius in 1502, but a Latin version had appeared in       1474.[1]    I    SOLON'S WORDS OF WISDOM TO CROESUS[2]      When all these conquests had been added to the Lydian empire, and the  prosperity of Sardis[3] was now at its height, there came thither, one  after another, all the sages of Greece living at the time, and among  them Solon, the Athenian. He was on his travels, having left Athens to  be absent ten years, under the pretense of wishing to see the world,  but really to avoid being forced to repeal any of the laws which at  the request of the Athenians he had made for them. Without his  sanction the Athenians could not repeal them, as they had bound  themselves under a heavy curse to be governed for ten years by the  laws which should be imposed on them by Solon.    On this account, as well as to see the world, Solon set out upon his  travels, in the course of which he went to Egypt to the court of  Amasis,[4] and also paid a visit to Croesus at Sardis. Croesus  received him as his guest, and lodged him in the royal palace. On the  third or fourth day after, he bade his servants conduct Solon over his  treasuries and show him all their greatness and magnificence. When he  had seen them all, and so far as time allowed inspected them,  Croesus addrest this question to him: \"Stranger of Athens, we have  heard much of thy wisdom and of thy travels through many lands, from  love of knowledge and a wish to see the world. I am curious therefore  to inquire of thee, whom of all the men that thou hast seen thou  deemest the most happy?\"    This he asked because he thought himself the happiest of mortals; but  Solon answered him without flattery, according to his true sentiments,  \"Tellus of Athens, sire.\" Full of astonishment at what he had heard  Croesus demanded sharply, \"And wherefore dost thou deem Tellus  happiest?\" To this the other replied: \"First, because his country was  flourishing in his days, and he himself had sons both beautiful and  good, and he lived to see children born to each of them, and these  children all grew up; and further, because after a life spent in what  our people look upon as comfort, his end was surpassingly glorious. In  a battle between the Athenians and their neighbors near Eleusis, he  came to the assistance of his countrymen, routed the foe, and died  upon the field most gallantly. The Athenians gave him a public funeral  on the spot where he fell, and paid him the highest honors.\"    Thus did Solon admonish Croesus by the example of Tellus,  enumerating the manifold particulars of his happiness. When he had  ended, Croesus inquired a second time, who after Tellus seemed to  him the happiest, expecting that at any rate he would be given the  second place. \"Cleobis and Bito,\" Solon answered: \"they were of Argive  race; their fortune was enough for their wants, and they were besides  endowed with so much bodily strength that they had both gained prizes  at the games. Also, this tale is told of them: There was a great  festival in honor of the goddess Juno at Argos, to which their mother  must needs be taken in a car. Now, the oxen did not come home from the  field in time; so the youths, fearful of being too late, put the yoke  on their own necks, and themselves drew the car in which their mother  rode. Five and forty furlongs did they draw her, and stopt before the  temple. This deed of theirs was witnessed by the whole assembly of  worshipers, and then their life closed in the best possible way.  Herein, too, God showed forth most evidently how much better a thing  for man death is than life. For the Argive men stood thick around the  car and extolled the vast strength of the youths; and the Argive women  extolled the mother who was blest with such a pair of sons; and the  mother herself, overjoyed at the deed and at the praises it had won,  standing straight before the image, besought the goddess to bestow on  Cleobis and Bito, the sons who had so mightily honored her, the  highest blessing to which mortals can attain. Her prayer ended, they  offered sacrifice and partook of the holy banquet, after which the two  youths fell asleep in the temple. They never woke again, but so passed  from the earth. The Argives, looking on them as among the best of men,  caused statues of them to be made, which they gave to the shrine at  Delphi.\"    When Solon had thus assigned these youths the second place Croesus  broke in angrily, \"What, stranger of Athens! is my happiness then so  utterly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20910"],[0,"South American Fights and Fighters, and Other Tales of Adventure (#4)"],[1,"stayed  at San Sebastian.  The supply of provisions was soon exhausted, and  finally it was evident that, as Encisco had not appeared with any  reenforcements or supplies, some one must go back to Hispaniola to  bring rescue to the party.  Ojeda offered to do this himself.  Giving  the charge of affairs at {16} San Sebastian to Francisco Pizarro, who  promised to remain there for fifty days for the expected help, he  embarked with Talavera.    Naturally Ojeda considered himself in charge of the ship; naturally  Talavera did not.  Ojeda, endeavoring to direct things, was seized and  put in chains by the crew.  He promptly challenged the whole crew to a  duel, offering to fight them two at a time in succession until he had  gone through the ship, of which he expected thereby to become the  master; although what he would have done with seventy dead pirates on  the ship is hard to see.  The men refused this wager of battle, but  fortune favored this doughty little cavalier, for presently a great  storm arose.  As neither Talavera nor any of the men were navigators or  seamen, they had to release Ojeda.  He took charge.  Once he was in  charge, they never succeeded in ousting him.    In spite of his seamanship, the caravel was wrecked on the island of  Cuba.  They were forced to make their way along the shore, which was  then unsettled by Spain.  Under the leadership of Ojeda the party  struggled eastward under conditions of extreme hardship.  When they  were most desperate, Ojeda, who had appealed daily to his little  picture of the Virgin, which he always carried with him, and had not  ceased to urge the others to do likewise, made a vow to establish a  shrine and leave the picture at the first Indian village they came to  if they got succor there.    Sure enough, they did reach a place called Cueyabos, where they were  hospitably received by the Indians, and where Ojeda, fulfilling his  vow, erected a log hut, or shrine, in the recess of which he left, with  much regret, the picture of the Virgin which had accompanied {17} him  on his wanderings and adventures.  Means were found to send word to  Jamaica, still under the governorship of Esquivel, whose head Ojeda had  threatened to cut off when he met him.  Magnanimously forgetting the  purpose of the broken adventurer, Esquivel despatched a ship to bring  him to Jamaica.  We may be perfectly sure that Ojeda said nothing about  the decapitation when the generous hearted Esquivel received him with  open arms.  Ojeda with Talavera and his comrades were sent back to  Santo Domingo.  There Talavera and the principal men of his crew were  tried for piracy and executed.    Ojeda found that Encisco had gone.  He was penniless, discredited and  thoroughly downcast by his ill fortune.  No one would advance him  anything to send succor to San Sebastian.  His indomitable spirit was  at last broken by his misfortunes.  He lingered for a short time in  constantly increasing ill health, being taken care of by the good  Franciscans, until he died in the monastery.  Some authorities say he  became a monk; others deny it; it certainly is quite possible.  At any  rate, before he died he put on the habit of the order, and after his  death, by his own direction, his body was buried before the gate, so  that those who passed through it would have to step over his remains.  Such was the tardy humility with which he endeavoured to make up for  the arrogance and pride of his exciting life.      IV. Enter One Vasco Nunez de Balboa    Encisco, coasting along the shore with a large ship, carrying  reenforcements and loaded with provisions for the party, easily  followed the course of Ojeda's {18} wanderings, and finally ran across  the final remnants of his expedition in the harbor of Cartagena.  The  remnant was crowded into a single small, unseaworthy brigantine under  the command of Francisco Pizarro.    Pizarro had scrupulously kept faith with Ojeda.  He had done more.  He  had waited fifty days, and then, finding that the two brigantines left  to him were not large enough to contain his whole party, by mutual  agreement of the survivors clung to the death-laden spot until a  sufficient number had been killed or had died to enable them to get  away in the two ships.  They did not have to wait long, for death was  busy, and a few weeks after the expiration of the appointed time they  were all on board.    There is something terrific to the imagination in the thought of that  body of men sitting down and grimly waiting until enough of them should  die to enable the rest to get away!  What must have been the emotions  that filled their breasts as the days dragged on?  No one knew whether  the result of the delay would enable him to leave, or cause his bones  to rot on the shore.  Cruel, fierce, implacable as were these  Spaniards, there is something Homeric about them in such crises as  these.    That was not the end of their misfortunes, for one of the two  brigantines was capsized.  The old chroniclers say that the boat was  struck by a great fish.  That is a fish story, which, like most fish  stories, it is difficult to credit.  At any rate, sink it did, with all  on board, and Pizarro and about thirty men were all that were left of  the gallant three hundred who had followed the doughty Ojeda in the  first attempt to colonize South America.    Encisco was for hanging them at once, believing that {19} they had  murdered and deserted Ojeda, but they were able to convince him at last  of the strict legality of their proceedings.  Taking command of the  expedition himself, as being next in rank to Ojeda, the Bachelor led  them back to San Sebastian.  Unfortunately, before the unloading of his  ship could be begun, she struck a rock and was lost; and the last state  of the men, therefore, was as bad as the first.    Among the men who had come with Encisco was a certain Vasco Nunez,  commonly called Balboa.  He had been with Bastidas and La Cosa on their  voyage to the Isthmus nine years before.  The voyage had been a  profitable one and Balboa had made money out of it.  He had lost all  his money, however, and had eked out a scanty living on a farm at  Hispaniola, which he had been unable to leave because he was in debt to  everybody.  The authorities were very strict in searching every vessel  that cleared from Santo Domingo, for absconders.  The search was  usually conducted after the vessel had got to sea, too!    Balboa caused himself to be conveyed aboard the ship in a provision  cask.  No one suspected anything, and when the officers of the boat had  withdrawn from the ship and Hispaniola was well down astern, he came  forth.  Encisco, who was a pettifogger of the most pronounced type,  would have dealt harshly with him, but there was nothing to do after  all.  Balboa could not be sent back, and besides, he was considered a  very valuable reenforcement on account of his known experience and  courage.    It was he who now came to the rescue of the wretched colonists at San  Sebastian by telling them that across the Gulf of Darien there was an  Indian tribe with many villages and much gold.  Furthermore, these {20}  Indians, unfortunately for them, were not acquainted with the use of  poisoned arrows.  Balboa urged them to go there.  His suggestion was  received with cheers.  The brigantines, and such other vessels as they  could construct quickly, were got ready and the whole party took  advantage of the favorable season to cross the Gulf of Darien to the  other side, to the present territory of Panama which has been so  prominent in the public eye of late.  This was Nicuesa's domain, but  nobody considered that at the time.    They found the Indian villages which Balboa had mentioned, fought a  desperate battle with Cacique Cemaco, captured the place, and  discovered quantities of gold castellanos (upward of twenty-five  thousand dollars).  They built a fort, and laid out a town called Maria  de la Antigua del Darien--the name being almost bigger than the town!  Balboa was in high favor by this time, and when Encisco got into  trouble by decreeing various oppressive regulations and vexatious  restrictions, attending to things in general with a high hand, they  calmly deposed him on the ground that he had no authority to act, since  they were on the territory of Nicuesa.  To this logic, which was  irrefutable, poor Encisco could make no reply.  Pending the arrival of  Nicuesa they elected Balboa and one Zamudio, a Biscayan, to take charge  of affairs.    The time passed in hunting and gathering treasure, not unprofitably  and, as they had plenty to eat, not unpleasantly.      V. The Desperate Straits of Nicuesa    Now let us return to Nicuesa.  Making a landfall, Nicuesa, with a small  caravel, attended by the two {21} brigantines, coasted along the shore  seeking a favorable point for settlement.  The large ships, by his  orders, kept well out to sea.  During a storm, Nicuesa put out to sea  himself, imagining that the brigantines under the charge of Lope de  Olano, second in command would follow him.  When morning broke and the  storm disappeared there were no signs of the ships or brigantines.    Nicuesa ran along the shore to search for them, got himself embayed in  the mouth of a small river, swollen by recent rains, and upon the  sudden subsidence of the water coincident with the ebb of the tide, his  ship took ground, fell over on her bilge and was completely wrecked.  The men on board barely escaped with their lives to the shore.  They  had saved nothing except what they wore, the few arms they carried and  one small boat.    Putting Diego de Ribero and three sailors in the boat and directing  them to coast along the shore, Nicuesa with the rest struggled westward  in search of the two brigantines and the other three ships.  They  toiled through interminable forests and morasses for several days,  living on what they could pick up in the way of roots and grasses,"]]]
