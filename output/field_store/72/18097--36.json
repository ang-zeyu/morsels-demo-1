For he was the true manifestation of the blessed verse \"And verily our  host shall overcome for them,\"(13) yet, notwithstanding this, he quaffed  the cup of martyrdom with perfect meekness, and, at the very moment of  uttermost defeat, triumphed over his enemies and became the most mighty of  the troops of the Supreme Host. Similarly they regarded the numerous  writings which, in spite of His lack of education, the Bab had composed,  as due to the promptings of the Holy Spirit; extracted from books contrary  sayings handed down by men of mark; adduced traditions apparently agreeing  with their objects; and clung to the announcements of certain notables of  yore. They also considered the conversion of austere and recluse doctors  and eminent votaries of the Perspicuous Religion [of Islam] as a valid  proof, deemed the steadfastness and constancy of the Bab a most mighty  sign, and related miracles and the like; which things, being altogether  foreign to our purpose, we have passed by with brevity, and will now  proceed with our original topic.    At the time of these events certain persons appeared amongst the Babis who  had a strange ascendancy and appearance in the eyes of this sect. Amongst  these was Mirza Muhammad-'Ali of Mazindaran, who was the disciple of the  illustrious Siyyid (may God exalt his station) Haji Siyyid Kazim of  Ra_sh_t, and who was the associate and companion of the Bab in His  pilgrimage journey. After a while certain manners and states issued from  him such that all, acting with absolute confidence, considered obedience  to him as an impregnable stronghold, so that even Mulla Husayn of  Bu_sh_ruyih, who was the leader of all and the arbiter appealed to alike  by the noble and the humble of this sect, used to behave in his presence  with great humility and with the self-abasement of a lowly servant.    This personage set himself to exalt the word of the Bab with the utmost  steadfastness, and the Bab did full justice to speech in praising and  glorifying him, accounting his uprising as an assistance from the Unseen.  In delivery and style he was \"evident magic,\" and in firmness and  constancy superior to all. At length in the year [A.H.] 1265 at the  sentence of the chief of lawyers the Sa'idu'l-'Ulama' the chief divine of  Barfuru_sh_, he yielded his head and surrendered his life amidst extremest  clamor and outcry.    And amongst them was she who was entitled Qurratu'l-'Ayn the daughter of  Haji Salih, the sage of Qazvin, the erudite doctor. She, according to what  is related, was skilled in diverse arts, amazed the understandings and  thoughts of the most eminent masters by her eloquent dissertations on the  exegesis and tradition of the Perspicuous Book, and was a mighty sign in  the doctrines of the glorious _Sh_ay_kh_ of Ahsa. At the Supreme Shrines  she borrowed light on matters divine from the lamp of Kazim, and freely  sacrificed her life in the way of the Bab. She discussed and disputed with  the doctors and sages, loosing her tongue to establish her doctrine. Such  fame did she acquire that most people who were scholars or mystics sought  to hear her speech and were eager to become acquainted with her powers of  speculation and deduction. She had a brain full of tumultuous ideas, and  thoughts vehement and restless. In many places she triumphed over the  contentious, expounding the most subtle questions. When she was imprisoned  in the house of [Mahmud] the Kalantar of Tihran, and the festivities and  rejoicings of a wedding were going on, the wives of the city magnates who  were present as guests were so charmed with the beauty of her speech that,  forgetting the festivities, they gathered round her, diverted by listening  to her words from listening to the melodies, and rendered indifferent by  witnessing her marvels to the contemplation of the pleasant and novel  sights which are incidental to a wedding. In short in elocution she was  the calamity of the age, and in ratiocination the trouble of the world. Of  fear or timidity there was no trace in her heart, nor had the admonitions  of the kindly-disposed any profit or fruit for her. Although she was of  [such as are] damsels [meet] for the bridal bower, yet she wrested  preeminence from stalwart men, and continued to strain the feet of  steadfastness until she yielded up her life at the sentence of the mighty  doctors in Tihran. But were we to occupy ourselves with these details the  matter would end in prolixity.    Well, Persia was in this critical state and the learned doctors perplexed  and anxious, when the late Prince Muhammad _Sh_ah died, and the throne of  sovereignty was adorned with the person of the new monarch. Mirza Taqi  _Kh_an Amir-Nizam, who was Prime Minister and Chief Regent, seized in the  grasp of his despotic power the reins of the affairs of the commonwealth,  and urged the steed of his ambition into the arena of willfulness and sole  possession. This minister was a person devoid of experience and wanting in  consideration for the consequences of actions; bloodthirsty and shameless;  and swift and ready to shed blood. Severity in punishing he regarded as  wise administration, and harshly entreating, distressing, intimidating,  and frightening the people he considered as a fulcrum for the advancement  of the monarchy. And as His Majesty the King was in the prime of youthful  years the minister fell into strange fancies and sounded the drum of          [Pages 21-40]      absolutism in [the conduct of] affairs: on his own decisive resolution,  without seeking permission from the Royal Presence or taking counsel with  prudent statesmen, he issued orders to persecute the Babis, imagining that  by overweening force he could eradicate and suppress matters of this  nature, and that harshness would bear good fruit; whereas [in fact] to  interfere with matters of conscience is simply to give them greater  currency and strength; the more you strive to extinguish the more will the  flame be kindled, more especially in matters of faith and religion, which  spread and acquire influence so soon as blood is shed, and strongly affect  men's hearts. These things have been put to the proof, and the greatest  proof is this very transaction. Thus they relate that the possessions of a  certain Babi in Ka_sh_an were plundered, and his household scattered and  dispersed. They stripped him naked and scourged him, defiled his beard,  mounted him face backwards on an ass, and paraded him through the streets  and bazaars with the utmost cruelty, to the sound of drums, trumpets,  guitars, and tambourines. A certain gabr who knew absolutely naught of the  world or its denizens chanced to be seated apart in a corner of a  caravansary. When the clamor of the people rose high he hastened into the  street, and, becoming cognizant of the offence and the offender, and the  cause of his public disgrace and punishment in full detail, he fell to  making search, and that very day entered the society of the Babis, saying,  \"This very ill-usage and public humiliation is a proof of truth and the  very best of arguments. Had it not been thus it might have been that a  thousand years would have passed ere one like me became informed.\"    At all events the minister with the utmost arbitrariness, without  receiving any instructions or asking permission, sent forth commands in  all directions to punish and chastise the Babis. Governors and magistrates  sought a pretext for amassing wealth, and officials a means of [acquiring]  profits; celebrated doctors from the summits of their pulpits incited men  to make a general onslaught; the powers of the religious and the civil law  linked hands and strove to eradicate and destroy this people.    Now this people had not yet acquired such knowledge as was right and  needful of the fundamental principles and hidden doctrines of the Bab's  teachings, and did not recognize their duties. Their conceptions and ideas  were after the former fashion, and their conduct and behavior in  correspondence with ancient usage. The way of approach to the Bab was,  moreover, closed, and the flame of trouble visibly blazing on every side.  At the decree of the most celebrated of the doctors, the government, and  indeed the common people, had, with irresistible power, inaugurated rapine  and plunder on all sides, and were engaged in punishing and torturing,  killing and despoiling, in order that they might quench this fire and  wither these [poor] souls. In towns where these were but a limited number  all of them with bound hands became food for the sword, while in cities  where they were numerous they arose in self-defense agreeably to their  former beliefs, since it was impossible for them to make inquiry as to  their duty, and all doors were closed.    In Mazindaran amongst other places the people of the city of Barfuru_sh_  at the command of the chief of the lawyers the Sa'idu'l-'Ulama' made a  general attack on Mulla Husayn of Bu_sh_ruyih and his followers, and slew  six or seven persons. They were busy compassing the destruction of the  rest also when Mulla Husayn ordered the a_dh_an to be sounded and  stretched forth his hand to the sword, whereupon all sought flight, and  the nobles and lords coming before him with the utmost penitence and  deference agreed that he should be permitted to depart.
