All I thought of at the time was that it would  please the child to see the poems in print and be able to give  the book to her friends. She did give it to her friends,\" he went  on ruefully, \"and ever since she's been trying to live it down.  I've seen her bite a young fellow's head off when he tried to  make a grand-stand play with her by quoting her poems which he'd  found in his sister's book-shelf.\"    \"But, in the name of goodness, what has all this to do with young  Crocker?\"    \"Why, it was this way. Most of the papers just gave Ann's book a  mention among 'Volumes Received,' or a couple of lines that  didn't amount to anything, but the _Chronicle_ saw a Sunday feature  in it, as Ann was going about a lot then and was a well-known  society girl. They sent this Crocker boy to get an interview from  her, all about her methods of work and inspirations and what not.  We never suspected it wasn't the straight goods. Why, that very  evening I mailed an order for a hundred copies to be sent to me  when the thing appeared. And--\" pinkness came upon Mr. Pett at  the recollection \"it was just a josh from start to finish. The  young hound made a joke of the poems and what Ann had told him  about her inspirations and quoted bits of the poems just to kid  the life out of them. . . . I thought Ann would never get over  it. Well, it doesn't worry her any more--she's grown out of the  school-girl stage--but you can bet she isn't going to get up and  give three cheers and a tiger if you bring young Crocker to live  in the same house.\"    \"Utterly ridiculous!\" said Mrs. Pett. \"I certainly do not intend  to alter my plans because of a trivial incident that happened  years ago. We will sail on Wednesday.\"    \"Very well, my dear,\" said Mr. Pett resignedly.    \"Just as you say. Er--just you and I?\"    \"And Ogden, of course.\"    Mr. Pett controlled a facial spasm with a powerful effort of the  will. He had feared this.    \"I wouldn't dream of leaving him here while I went away, after  what happened when poor dear Elmer sent him to school in England  that time.\" The late Mr. Ford had spent most of his married life  either quarrelling with or separated from his wife, but since  death he had been canonised as 'poor dear Elmer.' \"Besides, the  sea voyage will do the poor darling good. He has not been looking  at all well lately.\"    \"If Ogden's coming, I'd like to take Ann.\"    \"Why?\"    \"She can--\" he sought for a euphemism.    \"Keep in order\" was the expression he wished to avoid. To his  mind Ann was the only known antidote for Ogden, but he felt it  would be impolitic to say so.\"--look after him on the boat,\" he  concluded. \"You know you are a bad sailor.\"    \"Very well. Bring Ann--Oh, Peter, that reminds me of what I  wanted to say to you, which this dreadful thing in the paper  drove completely out of my mind. Lord Wisbeach has asked Ann to  marry him!\"    Mr. Pett looked a little hurt. \"She didn't tell me.\" Ann usually  confided in him.    \"She didn't tell me, either. Lord Wisbeach told me. He said Ann  had promised to think it over, and give him his answer later.  Meanwhile, he had come to me to assure himself that I approved. I  thought that so charming of him.\"    Mr. Pett was frowning.    \"She hasn't accepted him?\"    \"Not definitely.\"    \"I hope she doesn't.\"    \"Don't be foolish, Peter. It would be an excellent match.\"    Mr. Pett shuffled his feet.    \"I don't like him. There's something too darned smooth about that  fellow.\"    \"If you mean that his manners are perfect, I agree with you. I  shall do all in my power to induce Ann to accept him.\"    \"I shouldn't,\" said Mr. Pett, with more decision than was his  wont. \"You know what Ann is if you try to force her to do  anything. She gets her ears back and won't budge. Her father is  just the same. When we were boys together, sometimes--\"    \"Don't be absurd, Peter. As if I should dream of trying to force  Ann to do anything.\"    \"We don't know anything of this fellow. Two weeks ago we didn't  know he was on the earth.\"    \"What do we need to know beyond his name?\"    Mr. Pett said nothing, but he was not convinced. The Lord  Wisbeach under discussion was a pleasant-spoken and presentable  young man who had called at Mr. Pett's office a short while  before to consult him about investing some money. He had brought  a letter of introduction from Hammond Chester, Ann's father, whom  he had met in Canada, where the latter was at present engaged in  the comparatively mild occupation of bass-fishing. With their  business talk the acquaintance would have begun and finished, if  Mr. Pett had been able to please himself, for he had not taken a  fancy to Lord Wisbeach. But he was an American, with an  American's sense of hospitality, and, the young man being a  friend of Hammond Chester, he had felt bound to invite him to  Riverside Drive--with misgivings which were now, he felt,  completely justified.    \"Ann ought to marry,\" said Mrs. Pett. \"She gets her own way too  much now. However, it is entirely her own affair, and there is  nothing that we can do.\" She rose. \"I only hope she will be  sensible.\"    She went out, leaving Mr. Pett gloomier than she had found him.  He hated the idea of Ann marrying Lord Wisbeach, who, even if he  had had no faults at all, would be objectionable in that he would  probably take her to live three thousand miles away in his own  country. The thought of losing Ann oppressed Mr. Pett sorely.    Ann, meanwhile, had made her way down the passage to the gymnasium  which Mr. Pett, in the interests of his health, had caused to be  constructed in a large room at the end of the house--a room designed  by the original owner, who had had artistic leanings, for a studio.  The _tap-tap-tap_ of the leather bag had ceased, but voices from  within told her that Jerry Mitchell, Mr. Pett's private physical  instructor, was still there. She wondered who was his companion, and  found on opening the door that it was Ogden. The boy was leaning  against the wall and regarding Jerry with a dull and supercilious  gaze which the latter was plainly finding it hard to bear.    \"Yes, sir!\" Ogden was saying, as Ann entered. \"I heard Biggs  asking her to come for a joyride.\"    \"I bet she turned him down,\" said Jerry Mitchell sullenly.    \"I bet she didn't. Why should she? Biggs is an awful good-looking  fellow.\"    \"What are you talking about, Ogden?\" said Ann.    \"I was telling him that Biggs asked Celestine to go for a ride in  the car with him.\"    \"I'll knock his block off,\" muttered the incensed Jerry.    Ogden laughed derisively.    \"Yes, you will! Mother would fire you if you touched him. She  wouldn't stand for having her chauffeur beaten up.\"    Jerry Mitchell turned an appealing face to Ann. Ogden's  revelations and especially his eulogy of Biggs' personal  appearance had tormented him. He knew that, in his wooing of Mrs.  Pett's maid, Celestine, he was handicapped by his looks,  concerning which he had no illusions. No Adonis to begin with, he  had been so edited and re-edited during a long and prosperous  ring career by the gloved fists of a hundred foes that in affairs  of the heart he was obliged to rely exclusively on moral worth  and charm of manner. He belonged to the old school of fighters  who looked the part, and in these days of pugilists who resemble  matinee idols he had the appearance of an anachronism. He was a  stocky man with a round, solid head, small eyes, an undershot  jaw, and a nose which ill-treatment had reduced to a mere  scenario. A narrow strip of forehead acted as a kind of  buffer-state, separating his front hair from his eyebrows, and he  bore beyond hope of concealment the badge of his late employment,  the cauliflower ear. Yet was he a man of worth and a good  citizen, and Ann had liked him from their first meeting. As for  Jerry, he worshipped Ann and would have done anything she asked  him. Ever since he had discovered that Ann was willing to listen  to and sympathise with his outpourings on the subject of his  troubled wooing, he had been her slave.    Ann came to the rescue in characteristically direct fashion.    \"Get out, Ogden,\" she said.    Ogden tried to meet her eye mutinously, but failed. Why he should  be afraid of Ann he had never been able to understand, but it was  a fact that she was the only person of his acquaintance whom he  respected. She had a bright eye and a calm, imperious stare which  never failed to tame him.    \"Why?\" he muttered. \"You're not my boss.\"    \"Be quick, Ogden.\"    \"What's the big idea--ordering a fellow--\"    \"And close the door gently behind you,\" said Ann. She turned to  Jerry, as the order was obeyed.    \"Has he been bothering you, Jerry?\"    Jerry Mitchell wiped his forehead.    \"Say, if that kid don't quit butting in when I'm working in the  gym--You heard what he was saying about Maggie, Miss Ann?\"    Celestine had been born Maggie O'Toole, a name which Mrs. Pett  stoutly refused to countenance in any maid of hers.    \"Why on earth do you pay any attention to him, Jerry? You must  have seen that he was making it all up. He spends his whole time  wandering about till he finds some one he can torment, and then  he enjoys himself. Maggie would never dream of going out in the  car with Biggs.\"    Jerry Mitchell sighed a sigh of relief.    \"It's great for a fellow to have you in his corner, Miss Ann.\"    Ann went to the door and opened it. She looked down the passage,  then, satisfied as to its emptiness, returned to her seat.    \"Jerry, I want to talk to you. I have an idea. Something I want  you to do for me.\"    \"Yes, Miss Ann?\"    \"We've got to do something about that child, Ogden. He's been  worrying uncle Peter again, and I'm not going to have it. I  warned him once that, if he did it again, awful things would  happen to him, but he didn't believe me. I suppose, Jerry--what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20069"],[0,"Caruso and Tetrazzini on the Art of Singing (#4)"],[1,"  you had none at all. When you can see a vocalist pushing on the jaw you  can be perfectly certain that the tone she is emitting at that moment is  a forced note and that the whole vocal apparatus is being tortured to  create what is probably not a pleasant noise.    Any kind of mental distress will cause the jaw to stiffen and will have  an immediate effect upon the voice. This is one of the reasons why a  singer must learn to control her emotions and must not subject herself  to any harrowing experiences, even such as watching a sensational  spectacle, before she is going to sing. Fear, worry, fright--stage as  well as other kinds--set the jaw. So does too great a determination to  succeed. A singer's mind must control all of her feelings if it is going  to control her voice. She must be able even to surmount a feeling of  illness or stage fright and to control her vocal apparatus, as well as  her breath, no matter what happens.    The singer should feel as if her jaw were detached and falling away from  her face. As one great singer expresses it: \"You should have the jaw of  an imbecile when emitting a tone. In fact, you shouldn't know that you  have one.\" Let us take the following passage from \"The Marriage of  Figaro,\" by Mozart:    [Illustration: Voi-che sa-pe-te-]    This would make an excellent exercise for the jaw. Sing only the vowels,  dropping the jaw as each one is attacked--\"o, eh, ah.\" The o, of course,  is pronounced like the English o and the i in voi like e. The e in che  is pronounced like the English a. Sapete is pronounced sahpata. You now  have the vowels, o, ee, a, ah, a. Open the throat wide, drop the jaw and  pronounce the tones on a note in the easiest part of your voice.    Do not attack a note at the same time that you are inhaling. That is too  soon. Take the breath through the nose, of course, and give it an  instant to settle before attacking the sound. In this way you will avoid  the stroke of the glottis which is caused by the sudden and uncontrolled  emission of the accumulated breath. In attacking a note the breath must  be directed to the focusing point on the palate which lies just at the  critical spot, different for every tone. In attacking a note, however,  there must be no pressure on this place, because if there is the  overtones will be unable to soar and sound with the tone.    From the moment the note is attacked the breath must flow out with it.  It is a good idea to feel at first as if one were puffing out the  breath. This is particularly good for the high notes on which a special  stress must be laid always to attack with the breath and not to press or  push with the throat. As long as the tone lasts the gentle but  uninterrupted outpouring of the breath must continue behind it. This  breath pressure insures the strength and, while holding the note to the  focusing point on the palate, insures its pitch. In a general way it can  be said that the medium tones of the voice have their focusing point in  the middle part of the palate, the lower tones coming nearer to the  teeth to be centralized and the high notes giving the sensation of  finding their focusing point in the high arch at the back of the mouth  and going out, as it were, through the crown of the head.    The resonance in the head cavities is soon perceived by those who are  beginning to sing. Sometimes in producing their first high notes young  people become nervous and irritated when singing high tones at the  curious buzzing in the head and ears. After a short time, however, this  sensation is no longer an irritation, and the singer can gauge in a way  where his tones are placed by getting a mental idea of where the  resonance to each particular tone should be.    High notes with plenty of head vibration can only be obtained when the  head is clear and the nasal cavities unobstructed by mucous membrane or  by any of the depression which comes from physical or mental cause. The  best way to lose such depression is to practice. Practicing the long  scale, being careful to use the different registers, as described later,  will almost invariably even out the voice and clear out the head if  continued long enough, and will enable the singer to overcome nervous or  mental depression as well.    The different sensations in producing the tone vary according to the  comparative height and depth. Beginning from the medium tones, the  singer will feel as if each tone of the descending scale were being sung  farther outside of the mouth, the vibration hitting the upper teeth as  it goes out, whereas with the ascending scale the vibrations pass  through the nasal cavities, through the cavity in the forehead and up  back into the head, until one feels as if the tone were being formed  high over the head at the back.    I want to say right here that whenever a young singer feels  uncomfortable when singing he or she is singing incorrectly.    In attacking the note on the breath, particularly in the high notes, it  is quite possible that at first the voice will not respond. For a long  time merely an emission or breath or perhaps a little squeak on the high  note is all that can be hoped for. If, however, this is continued,  eventually the head voice will be joined to the breath, and a faint note  will find utterance which with practice will develop until it becomes an  easy and brilliant tone.    The reason that the tone has not been able to come forth is because the  vocal apparatus cannot adjust itself to the needs of the vocal chords or  because they themselves have not accustomed themselves to respond to the  will of the singer and are too stiff to perform their duty.    The scale is the greatest test of voice production. No opera singer, no  concert singer, who cannot sing a perfect scale can be said to be a  technician or to have achieved results in her art. Whether the voice be  soprano, mezzo or contralto, each note should be perfect of its kind,  and the note of each register should partake sufficiently of the quality  of the next register above or below it in order not to make the  transition noticeable when the voice ascends or descends the scale. This  blending of the registers is obtained by the intelligence of the singer  in mixing the different tone qualities of the registers, using as aids  the various formations of the lips, mouth and throat and the ever  present apoggio without which no perfect scale can be sung.          Facial Expression and Mirror Practice      In studying a new role I am in the habit of practicing in front of a  mirror in order to get an idea of the effect of a facial expression and  to see that it does not take away from the correct position of the  mouth.    The young singer should practice constantly in front of a mirror as soon  as she begins to sing songs or to express emotions in her music, for the  girl with the expressive face is likely to contort her mouth so that the  correct emission of tones is impossible.    The dramatic artist depends largely for her expression on the changing  lines of the mouth, chin and jaw, and in any lines spoken which denote  command or will you will see the actor's jaw setting and becoming rigid  with the rest of the facial mask.    Now, a singer can never allow the facial expression to alter the  position of the jaw or mouth. Facial expression for the singer must  concern itself chiefly with the eyes and forehead.    The mouth must remain the same, and the jaw must ever be relaxed,  whether the song is one of deep intensity or a merry scale of laughter.    The mouth in singing should always smile lightly. This slight smile at  once relaxes the lips, allowing them free play for the words which they  and the tongue must form and also gives the singer a slight sensation of  uplift necessary for singing.    It is impossible to sing well when mentally depressed or even physically  indisposed slightly. Unless one has complete control over the entire  vocal apparatus and unless one can simulate a smile one does not feel  the voice will lack some of its resonant quality, particularly in the  upper notes, where the smiling position of the mouth adjusts the throat  and air passages for the emission of light tones.    The lips are of the greatest aid in shaping and shading the tones.  Wagnerian singers, for instance, who employ trumpet-like notes in  certain passages are often seen shaping their lips like the mouthpiece  of a trumpet, with a somewhat square opening, the lips protruding.    However, this can be practiced only after perfect relaxation of the jaw  and control of the tongue have been accomplished.    A singer's mouth must always look pleasant, not only because it creates  a disagreeable impression on the audience to see a crooked and contorted  mouth, but also because natural and correct voice production requires a  mouth shaped almost into a smile.    Too wide a smile often accompanies what is called \"the white voice.\"  This is a voice production where a head resonance alone is employed,  without sufficient of the apoggio or enough of the mouth resonance to  give the tone a vital quality. This \"white voice\" should be thoroughly  understood and is one of the many shades of tone a singer can use at  times, just as the impressionist uses various unusual colors to produce  certain atmospheric effects.    For instance, in the mad scene in \"Lucia\" the use of the \"white voice\"  suggests the babbling of the mad woman, as the same voice in the last  act of \"Traviata\" or in the last act of \"Boheme\" suggests utter physical  exhaustion and the approach of death.    An entire voice production on these colorless lines, however, would  always lack the brilliancy and the vitality which inspire enthusiasm.    One of the compensations of the \"white voice\" singer is the fact that  she usually possesses a perfect diction. The voice itself is thrust into  the head cavities and not allowed to vibrate in the face and mouth and  gives ample room for the"]]]
