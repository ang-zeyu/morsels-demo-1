I call it  cheek!\"    Verity did not reply. She had had too many squabbles with Beatrice in  the past to want to begin a fresh campaign on the first day of a new  term. She discreetly pretended not to hear, and addressing Francie Hall,  launched into an account of her doings during the holidays.    \"We're moving out to Repworth at the September quarter,\" she concluded.  \"And it's too far for me to bicycle in to school every day, so I've  started as a boarder at the hostel. I shall go home for week-ends,  though. Nora Clifford and Fil Trevor are there too. They'll be glad  Ingred's come. With four of us out of one form, things ought to be  rather jinky. Hullo, here they are! I say, girls, let's go to our  diggings.\"    The two girls who came strolling up arm-in-arm were the most absolute  contrast. Nora was large-limbed, plump, rosy, with short-cut hair, a  lively manner, and any amount of confidence. Without being exactly  pretty, she gave a general impression of jolly, healthy girlhood, and  reminded one of an old-fashioned, sweet-scented cabbage rose that had  just burst into bloom. Dainty little Filomena might, on the other hand,  be described as the most delicate of tea roses. She was fair to a fault,  a lily-white maid with the silkiest of flaxen tresses. Her pale-blue  eyes, with their light lashes, and rather colorless little face with its  straight features were of the petite fairy type. You felt instinctively  that, like a Dresden china vase, she was made more for ornament than for  use, and nobody--even school-mistresses--expected too much from her.  Experience had shown them that they did not get it.    For two years, ever since her mother's death, Fil had been a boarder at  the College, and because at first she had been such a pathetic little  figure in her deep mourning, the girls had petted her, and had continued  an indulgent attitude long after the black dress had been exchanged for  colors. If Fil had rather got into the habit of posing as the mascot of  the form, she certainly deserved some consideration, for she was a dear  little thing, with a very sweet temper, and never made any of the  ill-natured remarks that some of the other girls flung about like  missiles. She was so manifestly unfitted to take her own part that  somebody else invariably took it for her.    Verity Richmond, who, with Nora, Filomena and Ingred, represented  VA. in the hostel, was a brisk, up-to-date, go-ahead girl, full  of fun and high spirits. She was a capital mimic, and had a turn for  repartee that, quite good-naturedly, laid any adversary flat in the  dust. If Nora and Fil were like rose and lily, she was decidedly the  robin of the party. Her fair complexion seemed to add force to the  brightness of her twinkling brown eyes, and her general restlessness and  quick alert ways made one think of a bird always hopping about. Though  not quite such a romp as Nora, she was ready for any fun that was going,  and intended to get as much enjoyment as possible out of the coming  term. She linked herself now on to Fil's disengaged arm, taking the  latter's pile of books with her own and began towing her two friends in  the direction of the hostel.    \"I've hardly had time even for a squint at our dormitory yet,\" she  announced. \"Mrs. Best said I was late, and made me pop down my bag and  fly; but she told me we were all four together, so I went off with an  easy mind. I'd been worrying for fear I'd be boxed up with some kids, or  sandwiched in among the Sixth. I told you Ingred was to be with us,  didn't I? Let's go and hunt her out; she'll have wiped her eyes and got  over her jim-jams by now. We'll have time to do some unpacking before  tea, if they've carried up our boxes.\"    The hostel was a separate house, built at the opposite side of the  school playground. It could accommodate thirty girls, and twenty-six  were already entered on its register. After a brief peep into the  attractive dining-hall, and an equally pleasant-looking boarders'  sitting-room, the three girls went upstairs to a dormitory marked 2.  They found Ingred already at work on her task of unpacking, putting  clothes away in drawers, and spreading the shelf that served as a  dressing-table with an assortment of photos, books, and toilet  requisites. She looked rather in the dumps, but it was impossible for  anybody to remain gloomy when in the presence of such lively spirits as  Nora and Verity, and by the time the gong sounded for tea she had  cheered up, and was sitting on her bed discussing school news.    [Illustration: \"LET'S CALL OURSELVES THE FOURSOME LEAGUE.\"]    \"Look here!\" said Verity. \"If we want to have a jolly term we four must  stick together. Let's make a compact that, both in school and in the  hostel, we'll support each other through thick and thin. We'll be a sort  of society of Freemasons. I haven't made up any secrets yet, but whoever  betrays them will be outlawed! Let's call ourselves 'The Foursome  League.' Now then, put your right hands all together on mine, and say  after me: 'I hereby promise and vow on my honor as a gentlewoman that  I'll stand by my chums in No. 2 Dormitory at any cost.' That's a good  beginning. When we've time, we'll draw up the rules. Subscriptions? Oh,  bother! You can each give sixpence if you like, and we'll spend the  money on a chocolate feast. Remember, Fil, not a word to anybody! It's  to be kept absolutely quiet. There's the gong. If the tea's up to the  standard of the rest of the hostel, I shan't object. Glad we're not  rationed now, for I'm as hungry as a hunter.\"          CHAPTER III    Wynch-on-the-Wold      Though the College only opened on Tuesday afternoon, the short remainder  of the week seemed enormously long to Ingred. Her form mates were the  same, but everything else was absolutely changed; she might have been at  a new school. She appreciated the convenient arrangements of the  handsome building: the lecture-hall, with its stained-glass window and  polished floor, the airy class-rooms, the studio with its facilities for  every kind of art work, the three music-rooms, the laboratory, the  gymnasium, and, last but not least, the hostel. Ingred had never before  been a boarder, and she had not expected to like the experience, but  there is a subtle charm in community life that infects everybody with  \"the spirit of the hive,\" and in spite of herself she began to be  interested in the particular set of faces that met round the table for  meals. The greater part of the girls were in the middle and lower  school, but there were a few members of the Sixth, who sat next to Mrs.  Best, the matron, and Nurse Warner, and looked with superior eyes on the  crowd of intermediates and juniors. To have secured such congenial  room-mates was an asset for which she could not be sufficiently  thankful. Whatever troubles might await her downstairs, it was a  comfort to know that she had three allies ready to flock to her support.  She had not known any of them well in the past, but as they seemed  prepared to offer their friendship, she also was ready to act the part  of chum. By exchanging desks with Linda Slater, she managed to secure a  seat next to Verity in school, and entered into an arrangement with her  that they should supply the missing gaps in each other's notes, for Miss  Strong often lectured so rapidly that it was impossible to keep up with  her.    \"I wish I knew shorthand,\" grumbled Ingred, comparing scribbles with  Verity as the girls tidied their hair for tea. \"How anybody's expected  to get down all Miss Strong tells us, I can't imagine! It's impossible.\"    \"I don't try,\" admitted Fil. \"At least I do try--I put a bit here and  there, but I write so slowly, I'm only half-way through before she's  bounced on to something else, and I've missed the beginning of it. I  have to stop, too, sometimes, to think how to spell the words.\"    The others laughed, for Fil's spelling was proverbial in the form, and  was often of a purely phonetic character. Miss Strong had periodical  crusades to improve it, but generally gave them up as a bad job, and  recommended constant use of a dictionary instead.    \"Though you can't go about the world with a dictionary perpetually under  your arm,\" she had remarked on the last occasion. \"If you have to write  a letter in a hurry, and you begin 'Dear Maddam' and end 'Yours  trueley'--well! Please don't let anybody know you've been educated here,  that's all, or it will be a poor advertisement for the College!\"    Ingred was not at all delighted to be still in Miss Strong's form. She  only moderately liked this mistress. Undoubtedly Miss Strong was a  clever teacher, but sarcasm was one of her favorite weapons of  discipline. Some of the girls did not mind it, indeed thought it rather  amusing, even when directed against themselves, and enjoyed it hugely  when someone else was the victim of the sally. Ingred, however, proud  and sensitive, writhed under the attacks of Miss Strong's sharp tongue,  and would often have preferred a punishment to a witticism. As a matter  of fact, the mistress rarely gave punishments, and was proud of her  ability to control her form without resorting to them. She was short in  stature, but made up in spirit for her lack of inches, and would fix her  dark eyes on offenders against discipline with the personal magnetism of  a circus trainer or a leopard-tamer. Schoolgirls are irreverent beings,  and though to her face her pupils showed her all respect, behind her  back they spoke of her familiarly as \"The Bantam,\" in allusion to her  small size but plucky disposition, or sometimes, in reference to her  sarcastic powers, as \"The Sark,\" which by general custom became \"The  Snark.\" On the whole Miss Strong's pithy, racy, humorous style of  teaching made her a far greater favorite than mistresses of duller  caliber. She had a"]]]
