Though quite close to Babylon, there is no doubt that Borsippa was a  most important religious centre, and this leads to the possibility,  that its great temple may have disputed with \"the house of the high  head,\" E-sagila in Babylon, the honour of being the site of the  confusion of tongues and the dispersion of mankind. There is no doubt,  however, that E-sagila has the prior claim, it being the temple of the  supreme god of the later Babylonian pantheon, the counterpart of the  God of the Hebrews who commanded the changing of the speech of the  people assembled there. Supposing the confusion of tongues to have  been a Babylonian legend as well as a Hebrew one (as is possible) it  would be by command of Merodach rather than that of Nebo that such a  thing would have taken place. E-sagila, which is now the ruin known as  the mount of Amran ibn Ali, is the celebrated temple of Belus which  Alexander and Philip attempted to restore.    In addition to the legend of the confusion of tongues, it is probable  that there were many similar traditions attached to the great temples  of Babylonia, and as time goes on, and the excavations bring more  material, a large number of them will probably be recovered. Already  we have an interesting and poetical record of the entry of Bel and  Beltis into the great temple at Niffer, probably copied from some  ancient source, and Gudea, a king of Lagas (Telloh), who reigned about  2700 B.C., gives an account of the dream which he saw, in which he was  instructed by the gods to build or rebuild the temple of Nin-Girsu in  his capital city.                         E-sagila according to Herodotus.    As the chief fane in the land after Babylon became the capital, and  the type of many similar erections, E-sagila, the temple of Belus,  merits just a short notice. According to Herodotus, it was a massive  tower within an enclosure measuring 400 yards each way, and provided  with gates of brass, or rather bronze. The tower within consisted of a  kind of step-pyramid, the stages being seven in number (omitting the  lowest, which was the platform forming the foundation of the  structure). A winding ascent gave access to the top, where was a  chapel or shrine, containing no statue, but regarded by the  Babylonians as the abode of the god. Lower down was another shrine, in  which was placed a great statue of Zeus (Bel-Merodach) sitting, with a  large table before it. Both statue and table are said to have been of  gold, as were also the throne and the steps. Outside the sanctuary (on  the ramp, apparently) were two altars, one small and made of gold,  whereon only unweaned lambs were sacrificed, and the other larger, for  full-grown victims.                            A Babylonian description.    In 1876 the well-known Assyriologist, Mr. George Smith, was fortunate  enough to discover a Babylonian description of this temple, of which  he published a /precis/. According to this document, there were two  courts of considerable extent, the smaller within the larger--neither  of them was square, but oblong. Six gates admitted to the temple-area  surrounding the platform upon which the tower was built. The platform  is stated to have been square and walled, with four gates facing the  cardinal points. Within this wall was a building connected with the  great /zikkurat/ or tower--the principal edifice--round which were  chapels or temples to the principal gods, on all four sides, and  facing the cardinal points--that to Nebo and Tasmit being on the east,  to Aa or Ea and Nusku on the north, Anu and Bel on the south, and the  series of buildings on the west, consisting of a double house--a small  court between two wings, was evidently the shrine of Merodach (Belos).  In these western chambers stood the couch of the god, and the golden  throne mentioned by Herodotus, besides other furniture of great value.  The couch was given as being 9 cubits long by 4 broad, about as many  feet in each case, or rather more.    The centre of these buildings was the great /zikkurat/, or temple-tower,  square on its plan, and with the sides facing the cardinal  points. The lowest stage was 15 /gar/ square by 5 1/2 high (Smith, 300  feet by 110), and the wall, in accordance with the usual Babylonian  custom, seems to have been ornamented with recessed groovings. The  second stage was 13 /gar/ square by 3 in height (Smith, 260 by 60  feet). He conjectured, from the expression used, that it had sloping  sides. Stages three to five were each one /gar/ (Smith, 20 feet) high,  and respectively 10 /gar/ (Smith, 200 feet), 8 1/2 /gar/ (170 feet),  and 7 /gar/ (140 feet) square. The dimensions of the sixth stage are  omitted, probably by accident, but Smith conjectures that they were in  proportion to those which precede. His description omits also the  dimensions of the seventh stage, but he gives those of the sanctuary  of Belus, which was built upon it. This was 4 /gar/ long, 3 1/2 /gar/  broad, and 2 1/2 /gar/ high (Smith, 80 x 70 x 50 feet). He points out,  that the total height was, therefore, 15 /gar/, the same as the  dimensions of the base, i.e., the lowest platform, which would make  the total height of this world-renowned building rather more than 300  feet above the plains.                               Other temple-towers.    Towers of a similar nature were to be found in all the great cities of  Babylonia, and it is probable that in most cases slight differences of  form were to be found. That at Niffer, for instance, seems to have had  a causeway on each side, making four approaches in the form of a  cross. But it was not every city which had a tower of seven stages in  addition to the platform on which it was erected, and some of the  smaller ones at least seem to have had sloping or rounded sides to the  basement-portion, as is indicated by an Assyrian bas-relief. Naturally  small temples, with hardly more than the rooms on the ground floor,  were to be found, but these temple-towers were a speciality of the  country.                                  Their origin.    There is some probability that, as indicated in the tenth chapter of  Genesis, the desire in building these towers was to get nearer the  Deity, or to the divine inhabitants of the heavens in general--it  would be easier there to gain attention than on the surface of the  earth. Then there was the belief, that the god to whom the place was  dedicated would come down to such a sanctuary, which thus became, as  it were, the stepping-stone between heaven and earth. Sacrifices were  also offered at these temple-towers (whether on the highest point or  not is not quite certain), in imitation of the Chaldaean Noah,  Ut-napistim, who, on coming out of the ark, made an offering /ina  zikkurat sade/, \"on the peak of the mountain,\" in which passage, it is  to be noted, the word /zikkurat/ occurs with what is probably a more  original meaning.                                     CHAPTER III                     THE BABYLONIAN STORY OF THE CREATION    This is the final development of the Babylonian creed. It has already  been pointed out that the religion of the Babylonians in all  probability had two stages before arriving at that in which the god  Merodach occupied the position of chief of the pantheon, the two  preceding heads having been, seemingly, Anu, the god of the heavens,  and Ea or Aa, also called Enki, the god of the abyss and of deep  wisdom. In order to show this, and at the same time to give an idea of  their theory of the beginning of things, a short paraphrase of the  contents of the seven tablets will be found in the following pages.                            An Embodiment of doctrine.    As far as our knowledge goes, the doctrines incorporated in this  legend would seem to show the final official development of the  beliefs held by the Babylonians, due, in all probability, to the  priests of Babylon after that city became the capital of the federated  states. Modifications of their creed probably took place, but nothing  seriously affecting it, until after the abandonment of Babylon in the  time of Seleucus Nicator, 300 B.C. or thereabouts, when the deity at  the head of the pantheon seems not to have been Merodach, but Anu-Bel.  This legend is therefore the most important document bearing upon the  beliefs of the Babylonians from the end of the third millennium B.C.  until that time, and the philosophical ideas which it contains seem to  have been held, in a more or less modified form, among the remnants  who still retained the old Babylonian faith, until the sixth century  of the present era, as the record by Damascius implies. Properly  speaking, it is not a record of the creation, but the story of the  fight between Bel and the Dragon, to which the account of the creation  is prefixed by way of introduction.                             Water the first creator.    The legend begins by stating that, when the heavens were unnamed and  the earth bore no name, the primaeval ocean was the producer of all  things, and Mummu Tiawath (the sea) she who brought forth everything  existing. Their waters (that is, of the primaeval ocean and of the sea)  were all united in one, and neither plains nor marshes were to be  seen; the gods likewise did not exist, even in name, and the fates  were undetermined--nothing had been decided as to the future of  things. Then arose the great gods. Lahmu and Lahame came first,  followed, after a long period, by Ansar and Kisar, generally  identified with the \"host of heaven\" and the \"host of earth,\" these  being the meanings of the component parts of their names. After a  further long period of days, there came forth their son Anu, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/207"],[0,"The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses (#4)"],[1,"hands.

If you're feeling pretty groggy, and you're licked beyond a doubt --                                             Grin.     Don't let him see you're funking, let him know with every clout,     Though your face is battered to a pulp, your blooming heart is stout;     Just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out --                                             And grin.     This life's a bally battle, and the same advice holds true                                             Of grin.     If you're up against it badly, then it's only one on you,                                             So grin.     If the future's black as thunder, don't let people see you're blue;     Just cultivate a cast-iron smile of joy the whole day through;     If they call you \"Little Sunshine\", wish that _THEY'D_ no troubles, too --                                             You may -- grin.     Rise up in the morning with the will that, smooth or rough,                                             You'll grin.     Sink to sleep at midnight, and although you're feeling tough,                                             Yet grin.     There's nothing gained by whining, and you're not that kind of stuff;     You're a fighter from away back, and you _WON'T_ take a rebuff;     Your trouble is that you don't know when you have had enough --                                             Don't give in.     If Fate should down you, just get up and take another cuff;     You may bank on it that there is no philosophy like bluff,                                             And grin.          The Shooting of Dan McGrew           A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;     The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;     Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,     And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known as Lou.       When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and the glare,     There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty, and loaded for bear.     He looked like a man with a foot in the grave       and scarcely the strength of a louse,     Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar,       and he called for drinks for the house.     There was none could place the stranger's face,       though we searched ourselves for a clue;     But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan McGrew.       There's men that somehow just grip your eyes,       and hold them hard like a spell;     And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;     With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done,     As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one by one.     Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd do,     And I turned my head -- and there watching him       was the lady that's known as Lou.       His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of daze,     Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze.     The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the stool,     So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like a fool.     In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;     Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands       -- my God! but that man could play.       Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful clear,     And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could _HEAR_;     With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the cold,     A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad for the muck called gold;     While high overhead, green, yellow and red,       the North Lights swept in bars? --     Then you've a haunch what the music meant...       hunger and night and the stars.       And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans,     But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;     For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof above;     But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love --     A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true --     (God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge, --       the lady that's known as Lou.)       Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce could hear;     But you felt that your life had been looted clean       of all that it once held dear;     That someone had stolen the woman you loved; that her love was a devil's lie;     That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl away and die.     'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair,       and it thrilled you through and through --     \"I guess I'll make it a spread misere,\" said Dangerous Dan McGrew.       The music almost died away... then it burst like a pent-up flood;     And it seemed to say, \"Repay, repay,\" and my eyes were blind with blood.     The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a frozen lash,     And the lust awoke to kill, to kill...       then the music stopped with a crash,     And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way;     In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;     Then his lips went in in a kind of grin,       and he spoke, and his voice was calm,     And \"Boys,\" says he, \"you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;     But I want to state, and my words are straight,       and I'll bet my poke they're true,     That one of you is a hound of hell... and that one is Dan McGrew.\"       Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out,       and two guns blazed in the dark,     And a woman screamed, and the lights went up,       and two men lay stiff and stark.     Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,     While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast       of the lady that's known as Lou.       These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know.     They say that the stranger was crazed with \"hooch\",       and I'm not denying it's so.     I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us two --     The woman that kissed him and -- pinched his poke --       was the lady that's known as Lou.          The Cremation of Sam McGee                _There are strange things done in the midnight sun           By the men who moil for gold;          The Arctic trails have their secret tales           That would make your blood run cold;          The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,           But the queerest they ever did see          Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge           I cremated Sam McGee._       Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.     Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.     He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;     Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd \"sooner live in hell\".       On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.     Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.     If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;     It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.       And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,     And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,     He turned to me, and \"Cap,\" says he, \"I'll cash in this trip, I guess;     And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request.\"       Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no;       then he says with a sort of moan:     \"It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold       till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.     Yet 'tain't being dead -- it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;     So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains.\"       A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;     And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.     He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;     And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.       There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,     With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;     It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:       \"You may tax your brawn and brains,     But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains.\"       Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.     In the days to come, though my lips were dumb,       in my heart how I cursed that load.     In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,       while the huskies, round in a ring,     Howled out their woes to the homeless snows --       O God! how I loathed the thing.       And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;     And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;     The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;     And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.       Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;     It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the \"Alice May\".     And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;     Then \"Here,\" said I, with a sudden cry, \"is my cre-ma-tor-eum.\"       Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;     Some coal I found that"]]]
