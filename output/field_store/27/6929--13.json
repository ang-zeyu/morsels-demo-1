Friend Kangaroo, we know, is of a somewhat serious nature, but probably  she will do us the pleasure of accompanying you to our little  entertainment.\"    \"I shall have great pleasure in doing so,\" said the Kangaroo; \"I have  not been at any of your parties for a long time. You know, I suppose,  that I lost my little Joey very sadly.\"    \"We heard all about it,\" replied the Bower Bird in a tone of  exaggerated, almost ridiculous sadness, for it was so anxious that the  Kangaroo should think that it felt very deeply for her loss. \"We were in  the middle of a meeting at the time the Wallaby brought the news, and we  were so sad that we nearly broke up our assembly. But it would have been  a pity to do so, really, as the young birds enjoy themselves so much at  the 'Bower of Pleasure.' But,\" said the Satin Bird, with a sudden change  of tone from extreme sorrow to one of vivacious interest, \"I must show  you the way to the bower, or you would never find it.\"    Dot jumped down from the swing, and she and the Kangaroo, guided by the  Satin Bird, made their way through some very thickly-grown bush. The  bird was certainly right in saying that they would never have found the  Bower of Pleasure without a guide. It was carefully concealed in the  most densely-grown scrub. As they were pushing their way through a  thicket of shrubs, before reaching the open space where the Satin Birds'  bower was built, they heard an increasing noise of birds all talking to  one another. The din of this chattering was enhanced considerably by the  shrill sounds of tree-frogs and crickets, and the hubbub made Dot feel  like the little Native Bear--as if her \"head was empty.\"    \"This will be a very pleasant party,\" said the Satin Bird, \"there is  plenty of conversation, so everyone's in a good humour.\"    \"Do you think anyone is listening, or are they all talking?\" enquired  the Kangaroo timidly.    \"Nobody would attempt to listen,\" answered the Satin Bird, \"it would be  impossible against the music of the tree frogs and crickets, so everyone  talks.\"    \"I should tell the tree-frogs and crickets to be quiet,\" said Dot, \"no  one seems to care for their music.\"    \"Oh, without music it would be very dull,\" explained the Satin Bird, \"no  one would care to talk. You understand, it would be awkward, someone  might overhear what was said.\"    As the bird spoke the trio reached the place where the bower was  situated.    Dot thought it a most curious sight. In the middle of an open space the  birds had built a flooring of twigs, and upon that they had erected a  bower about three feet high, also constructed of twigs interwoven with  grass, and arranged so as nearly to meet at the top in an arched form.    \"It's a new bower, and more commodious than our last,\" said the Satin  Bird with an air of satisfaction. \"What do you think of the  decorations?\"    In a temporary lull of the frog and cricket band and the conversation,  Dot and the Kangaroo praised the bower and its decorations, and enquired  politely how the birds had managed to procure such a collection of  ornaments for their pleasure hall. Several young bower birds came and  joined in the chat, and Dot was surprised to see how different their  plumage was from the satin blue-black of the old birds. These younger  members of the community were of a greenish yellow colour, with dark  pencillings on their feathers, and had no glossy sheen like their  elders.    Each of them pointed out some ornament that it had brought with which to  deck the bower. One had brought the pink feathers of a Galah, which had  been stuck here and there amongst the twigs. Others had collected the  delicate shells of land snails, and put them round about the entrance.  But the birds that were proudest of their contributions were those who  had picked up odds and ends at the camps of bushmen.    \"That beautiful bright thing I brought from a camp a mile away,\" said a  bird, indicating a tag from a cake of tobacco.    \"But it isn't so pretty as mine,\" said another, pointing to the glass  stopper of a sauce bottle.    \"Or mine,\" chimed in another bird, as it claimed a bright piece of tin  from a milk-can that was inserted in the twigs just above the entrance  of the bower.    \"Nonsense, children!\" said a grave old Satin Bird, \"your trifles are not  to be compared with that beautiful object I found to-day and arranged  along the top of the bower. The effect is splendid!\"    As he spoke, Dot observed that, twined amidst the topmost twigs of the  construction was a strip of red flannel from an old shirt, a bedraggled  red rag that must have been found in an extinct camp fire, judging by  its singed edges.    The day Dot had lost her way she had been threading beads, and she still  had upon her finger a ring of the pretty coloured pieces of glass. She  saw the old Satin Bird look at this ring longingly, so she pulled it  off, and begged that it might be added to the other decorations. It was  instantly given the place of honour--over the entrance and above the  piece of milk tin.    This gift from Dot caused an immediate flow of conversation, because  every bird was pleased to have something to talk about. They all began  to say how beautiful the beads were. \"Quite too lovely!\" said one. \"What  a charming little Human!\" exclaimed another. \"Just the finish that our  bower required,\" was a general remark, and a great many kept exclaiming,  \"So tasteful!\" \"So sweet!\" \"How elegant!\" \"Exquisite!\" \"It's a love!\"  \"It's a dear!\" and so on. A great deal more was said, but the oldest  bower bird, thinking that all the adjectives were getting used up, told  the frogs and crickets to start the music again, so as to keep the  excitement going, and all further observations were drowned in the  noise.    Presently the younger birds flew down to the bower, and began to play  and dance. Like a troop of children, they ran round and round the bower,  and to and fro through it, gleefully chasing each other. Then they would  assemble in groups, and hop up and down, and dance to one another in  what Dot thought a rather awkward fashion; but she was thinking of the  elegance and grace of the Native Companions, who can make beautiful  movements with their long legs and necks, whilst these little bower  birds are rather ungainly in their steps.    What amused her was to see how the young cock birds showed off to the  little hens. They were conceited fellows, and only seemed happy when  they had five or six little hens looking admiringly at their every  movement. At such times they would dance and hop with great delight; and  the little hens, in a circle round them, watched their hops and steps  with absorbed interest. Immensely pleased with himself, the young dancer  would fluff out his feathers, so as to look as big as possible, and  after strutting about, would suddenly shoot out a leg and a wing, first  on one side and then on the other, then spring high into the air, and do  a sort of step dance when his feet touched the earth again. Endless were  the tricks he resorted to, to show off his feathers and dancing to the  best advantage; and the little hens watched it all with silent  intentness.    In the meantime the frogs and crickets stopped to rest, and Dot could  hear the conversation of some of the old birds perched near her. A  little party of elderly hens were discussing the young birds who were  dancing at the bower.    \"I must say I don't admire that new step which is becoming so popular  amongst the young birds,\" said one elderly hen; and all her companions  rustled their feathers, closed their beaks tightly, and nodded their  heads in various ways. One said it was \"rough,\" another that it was  \"ungainly,\" and others that it was \"unmannerly.\"    \"As for manners,\" said the first speaker, \"the bower birds of this day  can't be said to have any!\" and all her companions chorused, \"No,  indeed!\"    [Illustration: THE BOWER BIRDS]    \"In my young day,\" continued the elderly hen, and all the group were  sighing, \"Ah! in our young days!\" when a young hen perched on a bough  above them, and interrupted pertly, \"Dear me! can't you good birds find  anything more interesting to talk about than ancient history?\" At this  the groups of gossips whispered angrily to one another \"Minx!\" \"Hussy!\"  \"Wild Cat!\" etc., and the rude young bird flew back to her companions.    \"What I object to most in young birds,\" said another elderly hen,  \"is their appearance. Some of them do nothing all day but preen their  feathers. Look at the over-studied arrangements of their wing flights,  and the affected exactness of their tail feathers! One looks in vain for  sweetness and simplicity in the present-day young bower birds.\"    \"Even that is better than the newer fashion of scarcely preening the  feathers at all,\" observed yet another of the group. \"Many of the young  birds take no pride in their feathers whatever, but devote all their  time to studying the habits of out-of-the-way insects.\" A chorus of  disapproval from all present supported this remark. \"Studies that  interfere with a young hen's appearance should not be permitted,\" said  one bird.    \"What is the good of knowing all about insects, when we live on berries  and fruit?\" asked another.    \"The sight of insects gives one the creeps!\" said a third.    \"I am thankful to say all my little hens care for nothing beyond playing  at the Bower and preening their feathers,\" said an affectionate bower  bird mother, \"They get a deal of attention paid to them.\"    \"No young Satin Bird would look at a learned little bower-hen,\" said the  bird who had first objected to untidy and studious young hens. \"For my  part, I never allow a chick of mine even to mention insects, unless they  are well-known beetles!\"  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#14)"],[1,"in matters of drawing, beside  influencing the Lombard and Veronese schools in their beginnings.    SCHOOLS OF VERONA AND VICENZA: Artistically Verona belonged with the  Venetian provinces, because it was largely an echo of Venice except at  the very start. Vittore Pisano (1380-1456), called Pisanello, was the  earliest painter of note, but he was not distinctly Veronese in his  art. He was medallist and painter both, worked with Gentile da  Fabriano in the Ducal Palace at Venice and elsewhere, and his art  seems to have an affinity with that of his companion.    Liberale da Verona (1451-1536?) was at first a miniaturist, but  afterward developed a larger style based on a following of Mantegna's  work, with some Venetian influences showing in the coloring and  backgrounds. Francesco Bonsignori (1455-1519) was of the Verona  school, but established himself later at Mantua and was under the  Mantegna influence. His style at first was rather severe, but he  afterward developed much ability in portraiture, historical work,  animals, and architectural features. Francesco Caroto (1470-1546), a  pupil of Liberale, really belongs to the next century--the High  Renaissance--but his early works show his education in Veronese and  Paduan methods.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--B. VIVARINI. MADONNA AND CHILD. TURIN.]    In the school of Vicenza the only master of much note in this Early  Renaissance time was Bartolommeo Montagna (1450?-1523), a painter in  both oil and fresco of much severity and at times grandeur of style.  In drawing he was influenced by Mantegna, in composition and coloring  he showed a study of Giovanni Bellini and Carpaccio.    VENETIAN LIFE AND ART: The conditions of art production in Venice  during the Early Renaissance were quite different from those in  Florence or Umbria. By the disposition of her people Venice was not a  learned or devout city. Religion, though the chief subject, was not  the chief spirit of Venetian art. Christianity was accepted by the  Venetians, but with no fevered enthusiasm. The Church was strong  enough there to defy the Papacy at one time, and yet religion with the  people was perhaps more of a civic function or a duty than a spiritual  worship. It was sincere in its way, and the early painters painted its  subjects with honesty, but the Venetians were much too proud and  worldly minded to take anything very seriously except their own  splendor and their own power.    Again, the Venetians were not humanists or students of the revived  classic. They housed manuscripts, harbored exiled humanists, received  the influx of Greek scholars after the fall of Constantinople, and  later the celebrated Aldine press was established in Venice; but, for  all that, classic learning was not the fancy of the Venetians. They  made no quarrel over the relative merits of Plato and Aristotle, dug  up no classic marbles, had no revival of learning in a Florentine  sense. They were merchant princes, winning wealth by commerce and  expending it lavishly in beautifying their island home. Not to attain  great learning, but to revel in great splendor, seems to have been  their aim. Life in the sovereign city of the sea was a worthy  existence in itself. And her geographical and political position aided  her prosperity. Unlike Florence she was not torn by contending princes  within and foreign foes without--at least not to her harm. She had  her wars, but they were generally on distant seas. Popery, Paganism,  Despotism, all the convulsions of Renaissance life threatened but  harmed her not. Free and independent, her kingdom was the sea, and her  livelihood commerce, not agriculture.    The worldly spirit of the Venetian people brought about a worldly and  luxurious art. Nothing in the disposition or education of the  Venetians called for the severe or the intellectual. The demand was  for rich decoration that would please the senses without stimulating  the intellect or firing the imagination to any great extent. Line and  form were not so well suited to them as color--the most sensuous of  all mediums. Color prevailed through Venetian art from the very  beginning, and was its distinctive characteristic.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--GIOVANNI BELLINI. MADONNA OF SS. GEORGE AND  PAUL. VENICE ACAD.]    Where this love of color came from is matter of speculation. Some say  out of Venetian skies and waters, and, doubtless, these had something  to do with the Venetian color-sense; but Venice in its color was also  an example of the effect of commerce on art. She was a trader with the  East from her infancy--not Constantinople and the Byzantine East  alone, but back of these the old Mohammedan East, which for a thousand  years has cast its art in colors rather than in forms. It was Eastern  ornament in mosaics, stuffs, porcelains, variegated marbles, brought  by ship to Venice and located in S. Marco, in Murano, and in Torcello,  that first gave the color-impulse to the Venetians. If Florence was  the heir of Rome and its austere classicism, Venice was the heir of  Constantinople and its color-charm. The two great color spots in Italy  at this day are Venice and Ravenna, commercial footholds of the  Byzantines in Mediaeval and Renaissance days. It may be concluded  without error that Venice derived her color-sense and much of her  luxurious and material view of life from the East.    THE EARLY VENETIAN PAINTERS: Painting began at Venice with the  fabrication of mosaics and ornamental altar-pieces of rich gold  stucco-work. The \"Greek manner\"--that is, the Byzantine--was practised  early in the fifteenth century by Jacobello del Fiore and Semitecolo,  but it did not last long. Instead of lingering for a hundred years, as  at Florence, it died a natural death in the first half of the  fifteenth century. Gentile da Fabriano, who was at Venice about 1420,  painting in the Ducal Palace with Pisano as his assistant, may have  brought this about. He taught there in Venice, was the master of  Jacopo Bellini, and if not the teacher then the influencer of the  Vivarinis of Murano. There were two of the Vivarinis in the early  times, so far as can be made out, Antonio Vivarini (?-1470) and  Bartolommeo Vivarini (fl. 1450-1499), who worked with Johannes  Alemannus, a painter of supposed German birth and training. They all  signed themselves from Murano (an outlying Venetian island), where  they were producing church altars and ornaments with some Paduan  influence showing in their work. They made up the Muranese school,  though this school was not strongly marked apart either in  characteristics or subjects from the Venetian school, of which it was,  in fact, a part.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--CARPACCIO. PRESENTATION (DETAIL). VENICE  ACAD.]    Bartolommeo was the best of the group, and contended long time in  rivalry with the Bellinis at Venice, but toward 1470 he fell away and  died comparatively forgotten. Luigi Vivarini (fl. 1461-1503) was the  latest of this family, and with his death the history of the Muranese  merges into the Venetian school proper, except as it continues to  appear in some pupils and followers. Of these latter Carlo Crivelli  (1430?1493?) was the only one of much mark. He apparently gathered  his art from many sources--ornament and color from the Vivarini, a  lean and withered type from the early Paduans under Squarcione,  architecture from Mantegna, and a rather repulsive sentiment from the  same school. His faces were contorted and sulky, his hands and feet  stringy, his drawing rather bad; but he had a transparent color,  beautiful ornamentation and not a little tragic power.    Venetian art practically dates from the Bellinis. They did not begin  where the Vivarini left off. The two families of painters seem to have  started about the same time, worked along together from like  inspirations, and in somewhat of a similar manner as regards the early  men. Jacopo Bellini (1400?-1464?) was the pupil of Gentile da  Fabriano, and a painter of considerable rank. His son, Gentile Bellini  (1426?-1507), was likewise a painter of ability, and an extremely  interesting one on account of his Venetian subjects painted with much  open-air effect and knowledge of light and atmosphere. The younger  son, Giovanni Bellini (1428?-1516), was the greatest of the family and  the true founder of the Venetian school.    About the middle of the fifteenth century the Bellini family lived at  Padua and came in contact with the classic-realistic art of Mantegna.  In fact, Mantegna married Giovanni Bellini's sister, and there was a  mingling of family as well as of art. There was an influence upon  Mantegna of Venetian color, and upon the Bellinis of Paduan line. The  latter showed in Giovanni Bellini's early work, which was rather hard,  angular in drapery, and anatomical in the joints, hands, and feet; but  as the century drew to a close this melted away into the growing  splendor of Venetian color. Giovanni Bellini lived into the sixteenth  century, but never quite attained the rank of a High Renaissance  painter. He had religious feeling, earnestness, honesty, simplicity,  character, force, knowledge; but not the full complement of  brilliancy and painter's power. He went beyond all his contemporaries  in technical strength and color-harmony, and was in fact the  epoch-making man of early Venice. Some of his pictures, like the S.  Zaccaria Madonna, will compare favorably with any work of any age, and  his landscape backgrounds (see the St. Peter Martyr in the National  Gallery, London) were rather wonderful for the period in which they  were produced.    Of Bellini's contemporaries and followers there were many, and as a  school there was a similarity of style, subject, and color-treatment  carrying through them all, with individual peculiarities in each  painter. After Giovanni Bellini comes Carpaccio (?-1522?), a younger  contemporary, about whose history little is known. He worked with  Gentile Bellini,"]]]
