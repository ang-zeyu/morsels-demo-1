Immediately following St. Martin's, the Abbeys of Gembloux, St. Bavon at  Ghent, and others, produced or acquired MSS. of the most sumptuous kind,  and before the thirteenth century the Netherlands had established quite  a distinguished reputation.    In a later chapter we shall deal with the development of its remarkable  schools, whose work eventually took rank, not only among the most  artistic, but the most prolific in Europe.          CHAPTER XIV    OTHONIAN ILLUMINATION    Departure from Carolingian--Bird and serpent--Common use of dracontine  forms in letter-ornament--Influence of metal-work on the forms of  scroll-ornament--The vine-stem and its developments--Introduction of  Greek taste and fashion into Germany--Cistercian illumination--The  Othonian period--Influence of women as patronesses and  practitioners--German princesses--The Empress Adelheid of Burgundy--The  Empress Theophano--Henry II. and the Empress  Cunegunda--Bamberg--Examples of Othonian art.      Perhaps the first departure towards a new style arising out of the  elements of Carolingian illumination is in the combination of the bird  and serpent used for letter forms and continued into coils of vine-stem  and foliage in combination with golden panelled frames or pilasters. The  monsters thus produced seem to be a revival of the dracontine forms of  the semi-barbarous Celtic and early Frankish arts. But the difference in  elegance and refinement of drawing and beauty of colouring is very great  indeed. Other animal forms are also made use of, nor is the human figure  altogether absent. Sometimes entire letters are made up of the latter in  various attitudes. Little scenes illustrative of the subject which the  initial commences are often placed within it, as, for instance, in the B  of the first psalm.[19]    [19] A characteristic Othonian Evangeliary of the eleventh century,  executed at the Abbey of Stavelot, may be seen in the Royal Library at  Brussels.    [Illustration:  BIBLIA SACRA  12TH CENT. (LATE)  _Brit. Mus. Harl. MS. 2799, fol. 185 v._]    [Illustration:  EVANGELIA (PARIS USE)  C. 1275  _Brit. Mus. Add. MS. 17341, fol. 120 v._]    Many twelfth-century initials look like designs in metal-work placed on  the panelled grounds of coloured enamels. But the rapid development of  the vine-stem coils out of the stemless foliages of the Carolingian and  Winchester styles is one of the wonders of the early German revival  after the accession of the Emperor Otho I. A still greater improvement  takes place after the marriage of his son Otho II. to the Princess  Theophano, daughter of Romanus II., attributable, no doubt, to a fresh  accession of artistic enthusiasm from the home of the new Empress. In  point of elegance of design, beauty of curve, adaptation of every part  to its share in the composition, nothing could be finer than the initial  letters of the Othonian period of illumination. The year 963 introduced  Greek fashions and Greek artists into Germany, the results of which are  at once traceable in the increased splendour of monastic illumination in  that country. The details of Greek ornament become the fillings of the  frames and panels of the large initials.    The Cistercian illuminators, or rather calligraphers, while they  constantly repudiate the golden splendour and monstrous follies of their  rivals, absolutely excel in this same ornamental draughtsmanship. What,  for example, could be finer than the pen-drawing of the great Arnstein  Bible in the British Museum (Harl. 2800)? The ornament is mostly in a  red ink, with flat-coloured blue, green, or yellow backgrounds, but it  is not to be surpassed. No, the interlacements and coils, foliages and  panels of the twelfth century are absolutely among the finest examples  of ornamental lettering ever conceived. Illuminating seemed at this  epoch to be more and more closely following the details of contemporary  architecture, and so paving the way to the next great variety of the  art, which is looked upon by some writers as the real beginning of  mediæval illumination.    It must be admitted, however, that the excellence limits itself to the  ornament. The human figure is wretchedly incorrect--even barbarous. It  may be asked why is this? How is it that while the decorative portion of  an illuminated book is beautiful in the highest degree, both in line and  colour, and yet occasionally the artist seems not to have the remotest  idea of the true shape of hands and feet or any part of the human body?  Of course the usual explanation offered is that monastic education did  not permit the study of the nude, and hence the monkish ignorance of  figure drawing. But that is scarcely an excuse for the monstrous hands  and feet and exaggerated facial expression of the miniatures. The  Italian monk Angelico, in spite of his monastic limitations, succeeded  in a most graceful rendering of the figure, and a charming delicacy in  the forms of the hands. As in some instances the artist does reach a  fair standard, it must be admitted that where he does not is owing to  actual inability in himself and not in his system. The three emperors  who give the name of Othonian to the period immediately succeeding the  Carolingian ruled Germany, and had much to do with the ruling of Italy,  from 936, when Otho I., called the Great, succeeded Henry the Fowler  about five years before the death of Athelstan, whose sister Eadgyth[20]  was Otho's first wife. His mother Mathilda was the patroness of the  cloister-schools for women, working in them personally. She herself  taught her servants and maids the art of reading. Her daughter Mathilda,  the famous Abbess of Quedlinburg, in 969 persuaded the Abbat Wittikind  of Corvey to write the History of the Saxon Kings, Henry her father, and  Otho her brother (now in the Royal Library at Dresden). Hazecha, the  Treasury-mistress of Quedlinburg, also employed the monks of Corvey,  with whose beautiful initial drawing she was greatly pleased, to  illuminate her own Life of St. Christopher. The beautiful but imperious  Princess Hedwig, another of Otho's sisters, read Virgil with Ekkehard of  St. Gall, and taught the child Burchard Greek, while Otho's niece  Gerberga, Abbess of Gandersheim, was the instructress of the celebrated  Hrosvita, \"the oldest German poetess.\" And this reminds us that at this  time the women-cloisters of Germany and the Netherlands were among the  most active centres of learning and book-production. The great monument  of feminine erudition and artistic skill, called the \"Hortus  Deliciarum,\" was of a somewhat later time, but other examples still  exist, among them the beautiful Niedermünster Gospels of the Abbess  Uota, now at Munich. A wood-cut by Albert Dürer prefixed to the first  edition of Hrosvita's works (Nürnberg, 1501) represents the nun Hrosvita  kneeling before the Emperor and beside the Archbishop Wilhelm of Mainz  presenting her book.[21] As to the literary labours of Hrosvita, this is  not the place to discuss them. She is simply an incidental figure in our  view of the brilliant Court of the Othos. A MS. of her works 500 years  after her death was found among the dust of the cloister-library at St.  Emmeram of Regensburg by Conrad Celtis, and, as we have seen, printed  for the first time in 1501. Thus she stands out as an illustration of  the fact often alluded to, of the importance of feminine foundations in  the monastic scheme.    [20] The chroniclers are rather confused as to the name of this Princess.    [21] It is thought, however, by some that the figure behind is that of  the Abbess--not the Archbishop. See Dürer Soc. Portfolio for 1900.    Her picturesque story of the romantic adventures of Adelheid of  Burgundy, her marriage in 947 to King Lothaire of Italy, her widowhood  and perils, her misfortunes and eventual marriage to the Emperor Otho,  reads more like a chapter from the _Morte d'Arthur_ or the _Arabian  Nights_ than a veracious history of real people. The Empress Adelheid  was, indeed, a remarkable woman, and the nun of Gandersheim is full of  her praises. In her younger days she had been a zealous patron and  protectress of the Abbey of Cluny, which stood on her native land of  Burgundy, and her sympathies remained always with the religious houses.  In this respect, indeed, she was a worthy successor of the pious  Mathilda and her daughters. She died in her seventy-first year in her  Abbey of Selz in Elsass, leaving a memory rich in benefits to the  monastics, especially those of Cluny, and venerated as the patroness of  many an illuminated volume of poems or theology, not to mention the  liturgical books executed at her expense for use in her various  foundations. The tenth century seems to have been an age of illustrious  women. No sooner do we leave the story of Adelheid than we enter upon  that of the young wife of Otho II., the Empress Theophano, daughter of  the Greek Emperor, Romanus II. When little more than a child she was  married to the son of Adelheid, he himself being in his twentieth year  in the year 972, and in the city of Rome. The young Greek Princess who  had been reared amid the luxury and splendour of the Eastern capital at  once became the fashion--the manners of her Byzantine household became  those of her Roman court, and were transplanted to her German home at  Bamberg. Artists, limners, copyists, musicians, scholars, formed part of  her retinue, and at once the German Court became the rival of those of  England, Byzantium, Cordova, and Rome.    It was, indeed, a Renaissance, an awakening in literature, art, and  social life. Nor did its glory fade until eclipsed by the succeeding  rivalries of France and Italy. Theophano survived her husband, who died  in 983, and proved herself a capable Regent during the infancy of her  son Otho III. She, however, did not live to see his early death, nor  indeed to see that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#14)"],[1,"various structures, and  especially well the false and the true vocal bands, with the space  between them (ventricle of Morgagni), but which has no special  function in phonation, unless it acts as a small resonance-chamber,  which is possible. This space is a natural result of the existence of  two pairs of vocal bands in such close proximity.]    [Illustration: FIG. 34 (Spalteholz). Parts have been cut away to  expose to view the whole of the inner surface of the larynx (lined  with mucous membrane). An excellent view of the vocal bands and of the  \"ventricle\" of the larynx, between them, is afforded.]    When the vocal bands are in action their vibrations are accompanied by  corresponding vibrations of the cartilages of the larynx--a fact of  which any one may convince himself by laying his fingers on the upper  part of the thyroid, especially when a low and powerful tone is  produced. This vibration is not confined to the larynx, but extends to  other parts--_e.g._, the chest itself, for when one speaks or sings a  distinct vibration of the chest walls can be felt, though the extent  to which this is present is very variable in different persons. As an  ascending scale is sung the larynx can be felt (by the fingers) to  rise, and the reverse as the pitch is lowered. This is due partly to  the action of those muscles attached to the larynx which are not  connected with the movements of the vocal bands, and partly to the  influence of the expiratory air-blast. The glottis, partially closed  as it must be in phonation, presents considerable resistance to the  outgoing stream of air, hence the upward movement of the larynx when  it is left free, and not held down by muscular action.    In singing and speaking the larynx should be steadied, otherwise the  \"attack,\" or application of the air-blast to the vocal bands, cannot  be perfect. On the other hand, it is obviously incorrect to attempt to  hold the larynx always in the same position. Holding down this organ  by main force, as in the production of the so-called \"straw bass,\" is  one of the surest methods of producing congestion and consequent  disorders of the vocal organs; and the author wishes to warn all  voice-producers against such unnatural practices. Students of  elocution and young actors often sin in a similar way, and  \"clergyman's sore throat\" is almost always due to this or some similar  misuse of the vocal organs. One's own sensations and common sense  should never be disregarded, however eminent the teacher who  recommends unphysiological methods.      PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS.    When the student has read the above description of the structure and  functions of the larynx, and studied the illustrations well, he will  be prepared to deal with the subject in a practical manner, and  without that it is feared his ideas will remain somewhat hazy.    First of all, he should try to find the parts mentioned in his own  person, following this up by examinations of others, for which purpose  children make good subjects, as they have usually necks that are not  too deeply padded with fat, and they may be easily led to take the  examinations as a sort of fun.    From above downward one feels in the middle line the parts in the  order previously mentioned, beginning with the hyoid bone. One may  learn that the larynx is movable and yielding, a hard structure  covered with softer tissues, but what these are, and much more, can  only be learned by examination of the larynx after it has been removed  from some animal. Every butcher can provide the material for getting a  sound, practical knowledge of the respiratory apparatus. He may be  asked to supply the following:    1. A pig's \"pluck\"--_i.e._, the \"lights,\" or lungs, with the windpipe  attached. The liver, heart, etc., are not required, though to observe  the relations of the circulatory system--_i.e._, the heart and large  blood-vessels--to the respiratory system will be time well spent.  Unless special instructions are given, the larynx, which the butcher  may term the \"weezend,\" may be lacking or mutilated. It should be  explained that this organ, with a part of the windpipe and the extreme  back part of the tongue, and all below it, are required. For one  sitting this single \"pluck\" will suffice, as it will serve for a  general examination. The lungs may be dilated by inserting a tube into  the windpipe, tying it in position, and blowing into it with greater  or less force. It should be especially observed how suddenly the lungs  collapse when the breath force is removed, as this illustrates well  their _elasticity_. By cutting through the windpipe lengthwise and  following it downward one learns how numerous are the branches of the  bronchial tree, etc.    For a second sitting one should secure at least two specimens of the  larynx of the pig or sheep, though the former is more like the human,  and so the better on the whole. A case of dissecting instruments is  not essential; a sharp pocket-knife will serve the purpose. In order  that the student may have a clear idea of the cartilages, all the soft  tissues must be cut or scraped away. It is necessary to exercise great  care, or the membranes connecting the cartilages together will be cut  through; and on the other hand, unless the work in the neighborhood of  the arytenoids be cautiously done, these cartilages may be injured,  and it is most important that their swivel-like action and their  relations to the true vocal bands be observed. The glottic chink can  be seen from above or below, and should be observed from both  view-points. Its margins are formed by the true vocal bands.    Then, with the figures before him, the student should endeavor to  isolate each of the muscles described. The muscles can always be  recognized by their red color, but it is to be remembered that those  on the inner surface of the larynx, such as the crico-arytenoid, are  covered with mucous membrane, which after death is very pale. This can  by careful dissection be removed, and if in doing this a small pair of  forceps be employed, the work will be greatly facilitated. One must be  very skilful indeed if he would get all the muscles \"out,\" or well  exposed to view as individuals, on a single specimen. Likely several  will be required before entirely satisfactory results are reached, but  these are well worth all the time and labor required. The action of  the muscles can in some measure be demonstrated by pulling on them in  the direction of their loosest attachment, though it must be confessed  this is much more difficult in the case of most of the muscles of the  larynx than in those of other parts of the body.    Should the specimens be very successfully dissected, it may be worth  while to keep them for future observation, in rather weak alcohol (40  per cent.), in, say, a preserve jar.    All examinations of the vocal bands may leave the observer  disappointed; he may fail to realize, most likely, how such wonderful  results can be accomplished by structures so simple as those he sees  before him. But when the laryngoscope is brought into use, then comes  a revelation. This instrument will be described in the next chapter.      HYGIENE.    Some of the hygienic principles involved have already been referred to  and illustrated, and others follow from the facts already set forth.  It is very important for the voice-user to bear in mind that his  larynx is a part of the respiratory tract, and that the whole of this  region and the entire digestive tract, part of which is common to  both, are lined with mucous membrane. If the nose be affected with  catarrh, the throat does not usually long escape; and if the back of  the mouth cavity (_pharynx_) be disordered, the vocal bands and other  parts of the larynx are almost sure to be involved more or less.    The condition of the stomach is reflexly, if not by direct continuity  through the mucous membrane, expressed in the throat generally; hence  as experience shows, the voice-user cannot exercise too great care as  to what and how much he eats, especially before a public appearance.  He must know himself what best suits him, in this regard, to a degree  that is necessary for few others.    When singing, more blood is sent to the organs used, hence the great  danger of that excess of blood being retained in the parts too long,  as might easily happen from pressure about the neck, etc. It is  scarcely necessary to point out that draughts, cold rooms, etc., will  also determine the blood from the skin inward, and set up that  complicated condition of multiform evils known as \"a cold.\" The  obvious principle of prevention lies in keeping the body, and  especially the neck, shoulders, and chest, warm after using the vocal  organs in any way in public. To hand the singer a wrap after leaving  the platform is always wise, and the judicious friend will see that  conversation is not allowed, much less forced on the possibly  breathless and wearied voice-user--a precaution that is probably more  honored in the breach than in the observance, for in this as in other  cases one's friends are sometimes his worst enemies.      SUMMARY.    The larynx is the most important organ in voice-production, and  consists of cartilages, muscles, the vocal bands, true and false,  membranes and ligaments, folds of mucous membrane, etc. It is situated  between the hyoid (tongue) bone above and the trachea below. The  cartilages are the (1) epiglottis, (2) thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid,  the two small, unimportant cornicula laryngis, or cartilages of  Santorini, surmounting the arytenoids, and the two cuneiform, or  cartilages of Wrisberg, in the folds of mucous membrane on each side  of the arytenoids.    The muscles are attached to the main cartilages. In addition to the  muscles that are concerned with the movements of the vocal bands,  others that hold the larynx in place or raise and lower it are  attached _externally_ to these,"]]]
