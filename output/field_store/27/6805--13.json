As might have been expected, game was here plentiful: numerous  pigeons and other birds came down at nightfall (which was now the hour)  for the purpose of drinking at this lone pool, and the numbers of birds  of different kinds that congregated here was a most convincing proof of  the general aridity of this part of the country. Indeed the natives  subsequently reported that the tract we had just traversed was at this  season of the year totally devoid of water. It was in vain now that I  raised the gun, for my tremulous hand shook so that I could not for a  moment cover the bird I aimed at, and after one or two ineffectual  attempts to kill something I was obliged to desist in despair.    PANGS OF HUNGER.    I now dreaded that I had only escaped the pains of death by thirst in  order to perish of hunger, and for a moment regretted that I had not died  ere I found water, for I firmly believed, from the state of weakness I  was then reduced to, that the bitterness of death had passed. But a short  period sufficed to smother these unmanly and unchristian feelings in my  breast, and, seeing a flight of black cockatoos soaring about in the air,  I determined to watch them to their roosting-place, and then favoured by  the darkness of night to steal upon them. On my return to the party I  found the men sitting by the hole of water, anxiously watching until they  again saw a little black mud in it, which they then eagerly swallowed.    I found some difficulty in inducing them to light their fire and to  choose a situation where they could repose for the night, but, having  accomplished this, I sat down by my own, hand-rubbing my limbs until it  should grow rather darker. At length I had the pleasure of seeing that  the black cockatoos, who found we were not likely to leave them in  possession of the water, had taken up their position for the night in a  large clump of trees distant not more than half a mile, and I hereupon  started with Kaiber to try and get a shot at them.    SHOOT AND COOK A COCKATOO.    After about an hour's wandering and excitement such only as the desperate  gambler can know whose life depends upon the stake for which he plays, I  succeeded in getting a shot into a whole flight of roosting and snoring  black cockatoos, and one fell. I pounced in triumph on it and received a  bite which, famishing as I was, somewhat damped my ardour; Kaiber however  hit it upon the head with a stick, and we then bore it off to our fire.    The men had cooked one spoonful of flour each in the liquid mud which the  pool afforded, and assured me that they found this thick water very  nourishing; whence I concluded that the large portion of mud it contained  in some degree gratified the cravings of the stomach. Kaiber soon plucked  the cockatoo and roasted it: I gave him the entrails, the feet, and the  first joint of the legs, eating the head and thighs myself and reserving  the other portions as a store against future emergencies. I now felt  assured that my life was saved and, rendering thanks to God for his many  mercies, I laid down by the fire to watch for the first appearance of  dawn.    April 18.    The men slept but little during the night: every now and then one of them  visited the hole of mud and water to see if a little of this fluid had  drained into it, and about an hour before daylight I roused them up to  proceed upon their journey. They were dreadfully feeble though upon the  whole stronger than they had been for the last three days. We now entered  upon a more hilly country than we had traversed yesterday; the hills were  steep, being composed of sand and recent limestone, whilst the valleys  were thickly wooded with grass-trees and stunted Banksias. The general  line of route I followed was south by east, and we had not travelled more  than nine miles when we came suddenly upon a valley with a river running  rapidly through it. The sight of this cheered us up; and when on tasting  the water we found it excellent, and saw adhering to the banks a species  of freshwater mussel (Unio) called by the natives Maraylya, our joy was  complete.    SUPERSTITIOUS FEELINGS OF KAIBER REGARDING MUSSELS.    I proceeded therefore to collect wood for my fire and ordered Kaiber to  make haste and gather some of these mussels, an order which, considering  the hungry state he was in, I imagined he would gladly have obeyed; but  to my astonishment he refused positively to touch one of them, and  evidently regarded them with a superstitious dread and abhorrence. My  arguments to induce him to move were all thrown away; he constantly  affirmed that if he touched these shellfish through their agency the  Boyl-yas* would acquire some mysterious influence over him, which would  end in his death. He could not state a recent instance of any ill effects  having happened from handling or catching the mussel; but when I taunted  him with this he very shrewdly replied that his inability to do so only  arose from the fact of nobody being \"wooden-headed enough\" to meddle with  them, and that he intended to have nothing whatever to do with them. This  much he assured me was certain: that a very very long time ago some  natives had eaten them, and that bad spirits had immediately killed them  for so doing.    (*Footnote. The Boyl-ya is the native sorcerer.)    Kaiber was a great deal too sensible a fellow to be allowed to remain a  prey to so ridiculous a superstition as this was; I therefore ordered him  instantly to go and bring some of these mussels to me; that I intended to  eat them, but that he could in this respect please himself. He hereupon,  after thinking for a moment or two, got up to obey me, and walked away  for this purpose; but I heard him, whilst occupied in the task, lamenting  his fate most bitterly. It was true, he said, that he had not died either  of hunger or thirst, but this was all owing to his courage and strong  sinews, yet what would these avail against the supernatural powers of the  boyl-yas. \"They will eat me at night, whilst, worn out by fatigue, I must  sleep.\" Amidst these and sundry other similar exclamations he brought the  mussels to me: by this time my fire was prepared, and in a few minutes I  was making such a meal as the weak state of my stomach would admit of. No  inducement of mine could however prevail upon Kaiber to share with me,  and I therefore handed him the remains of the cockatoo.    As soon as my repast was concluded I walked about three miles up the  river in the hopes of getting a duck, Kaiber accompanying me. We saw  several but killed none. There were some fine reaches in the river, as  well as some good flats along its banks.    In the afternoon we travelled about three miles in a south by east  direction, and then came to the bed of a small stream, which ran from  east to west but was now merely a chain of pools. Across the bed where we  passed it was a native weir. Our route during the whole evening lay over  hills of a nature similar to those we passed yesterday. We did not halt  until it was so dark that we could not see to walk, and then just dropped  at the spot where we ceased to move.    DISTRESS FROM COLD.    The men made their fire and I lighted mine from theirs; but scarcely was  this done ere the rain fell in torrents. I had no blankets or protection  of any kind against this, and Kaiber was in the same predicament; so that  when the fire was extinguished our position became pitiable in the  extreme, for I know not if I ever before suffered so much from cold; and  to add to my annoyance I every now and then heard Kaiber chattering to  himself, under its effects, rather than singing:    Oh wherefore did he eat the mussels?  Now the boyl-yas storms and thunder make;  Oh wherefore would he eat the mussels?\"    At last I so completely lost my temper that I roared out, \"You  stone-headed fellow, Kaiber, if you talk of mussels again, I'll beat  you.\" \"What spoke I this morning?\" replied Kaiber; \"you are stone-headed.  We shall be dead directly; wherefore ate you the mussels?\" This was  beyond what my patience in my present starved state could endure, so I  got up and began to grope about for a stick or something to throw in the  direction of the chattering blockhead; but he begged me to remain quiet,  promising faithfully to make no more mention of the mussels. I therefore  squatted down, in a state of the most abject wretchedness.    CRIPPLED STATE OF THE MEN.    I nearly expired from cold and pain during this inclement night; the  rheumatism in the hip in which I had been wounded was dreadful, and I  lost the power of moving my extremities from cold. Kaiber must have  suffered even more for he had nothing but a shirt on, whereas I had also  a pair of trousers. The men were in somewhat better condition for they  had a blanket, or rather a piece of one, between each two, and lying  together they afforded one another mutual warmth. The long starvation  which we had undergone had totally unfitted us all to cope with anything  like cold.    April 19.    The rain and clouds protracted the morning dawn until late, which  somewhat lengthened our miseries. As soon however as it was light enough  to see our way we started, and moved slowly onwards in a south by east  direction. The men were all completely crippled from the cold of the  night, and it was with the greatest difficulty I could get either them or  the native to move. My own energies were however only raised from these  calls upon them, and I cheered them on as well as I could. Corporal  Coles, my faithful and tried companion in all my wanderings, could  scarcely crawl along. The flesh was completely torn away from one of his  heels, and the irritation caused by this had produced a large swelling in  the groin."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16160"],[0,"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt (#14)"],[1," to be found in Egypt from the earliest times down to  the period of the Greek occupation of the country, and, in fact, until  the present day. That is to say, it was a philosophy inborn in the  Egyptian,--a part of his nature.    Imhotep, the famous philosopher of Dynasty III., about B.C. 3000, said  to his disciples: \"Behold the dwellings of the dead. Their walls fall  down, their place is no more; they are as though they had never  existed\"; and he drew from this the lesson that man is soon done with  and forgotten, and that therefore his life should be as happy as  possible. To Imhotep must be attributed the earliest known exhortation  to man to resign himself to his candle-end of a life, and to the  inevitable snuffing-out to come, and to be merry while yet he may. There  is a poem, dating from about B.C. 2000, from which the following is  taken:--         \"Walk after thy heart's desire so long as thou livest.       Put myrrh on thy head, clothe thyself in fine linen,       anoint thyself with the true marvels of God.... Let not       thy heart concern itself, until there cometh to thee that       great day of lamentation. Yet he who is at rest can hear       not thy complaint, and he who lies in the tomb can       understand not thy weeping. Therefore, with smiling face,       let thy days be happy, and rest not therein. For no man       carrieth his goods away with him; \"O, no man returneth       again who is gone thither.\"    Again, we have the same sentiments expressed in a tomb of about B.C.  1350, belonging to a certain Neferhotep, a priest of Amen. It is quoted  on page 235, and here we need only note the ending:         \"Come, songs and music are before thee. Set behind thee       all cares; think only upon gladness, until that day       cometh whereon thou shalt go down to the land which       loveth silence.\"    A Ptolemaic inscription quoted more fully towards the end of this  chapter reads: \"Follow thy desire by night and by day. Put not care  within thy heart.\"    The ancient Egyptian peasants, like their modern descendants, were  fatalists, and a happy carelessness seems to have softened the  strenuousness of their daily tasks. The peasants of the present day in  Egypt so lack the initiative to develop the scope of their industries  that their life cannot be said to be strenuous. In whatever work they  undertake, however, they show a wonderful degree of cheerfulness, and a  fine disregard for misfortune. Their forefathers, similarly, went  through their labours with a song upon their lips. In the tombs at  Sakkara, dating from the Old Empire, there are scenes representing  flocks of goats treading in the seed on the newly-sown ground, and the  inscriptions give the song which the goat-herds sing:--        \"The goat-herd is in the water with the fishes,--       He speaks with the _nar_-fish, he talks with the pike;       From the west is your goat-herd; your goat-herd is from the west.\"    The meaning of the words is not known, of course, but the song seems to  have been a popular one. A more comprehensible ditty is that sung to the  oxen by their driver, which dates from the New Empire:--        \"Thresh out for yourselves, ye oxen, thresh out for yourselves.       Thresh out the straw for your food, and the grain for your masters.       Do not rest yourselves, for it is cool to-day.\"    Some of the love-songs have been preserved from destruction, and these  throw much light upon the subject of the Egyptian temperament. A number  of songs, supposed to have been sung by a girl to her lover, form  themselves into a collection entitled \"The beautiful and gladsome songs  of thy sister, whom thy heart loves, as she walks in the fields.\" The  girl is supposed to belong to the peasant class, and most of the verses  are sung whilst she is at her daily occupation of snaring wild duck in  the marshes. One must imagine the songs warbled without any particular  refrain, just as in the case of the modern Egyptians, who pour out their  ancient tales of love and adventure in a series of bird-like cadences,  full-throated, and often wonderfully melodious. A peculiar sweetness and  tenderness will be noticed in the following examples, and though they  suffer in translation, their airy lightness and refinement is to be  distinguished. One characteristic song, addressed by the girl to her  lover, runs--                  \"Caught by the worm, the wild duck cries,                 But in the love-light of thine eyes                 I, trembling, loose the trap. So flies                           The bird into the air.                 What will my angry mother say?                 With basket full I come each day,                 But now thy love hath led me stray,                           And I have set no snare.\"    Again, in a somewhat similar strain, she sings--                  \"The wild duck scatter far, and now                 Again they light upon the bough                           And cry unto their kind;                 Anon they gather on the mere--                 But yet unharmed I leave them there,                           For love hath filled my mind.\"    Another song must be given here in prose form. The girl who sings it is  supposed to be making a wreath of flowers, and as she works she cries--         \"I am thy first sister, and to me thou art as a garden       which I have planted with flowers and all sweet-smelling       herbs. And I have directed a canal into it, that thou       mightest dip thy hand into it when the north wind blows       cool. The place is beautiful where we walk, because we       walk together, thy hand resting within mine, our mind       thoughtful and our heart joyful. It is intoxicating to me       to hear thy voice, yet my life depends upon hearing it.       Whenever I see thee it is better to me than food and       drink.\"    One more song must be quoted, for it is so artless and so full of human  tenderness that I may risk the accusation of straying from the main  argument in repeating it. It runs:--                      \"The breath of thy nostrils alone                     Is that which maketh my heart to live.                     I found thee:                     God grant thee to me                     For ever and ever.\"    It is really painful to think of these words as having fallen from the  lips of what is now a resin-smelling lump of bones and hardened flesh,  perhaps still unearthed, perhaps lying in some museum show-case, or  perhaps kicked about in fragments over the hot sand of some  tourist-crowded necropolis. Mummies are the most lifeless objects one  could well imagine. It is impossible even for those whose imaginations  are most powerful, to infuse life into a thing so utterly dead as an  embalmed body; and this fact is partly responsible for that atmosphere  of stark, melancholy, sobriety and aloofness which surrounds the affairs  of ancient Egypt. In reading these verses, it is imperative for their  right understanding that the mummies and their resting-places should be  banished from the thoughts. It is not always a simple matter for the  student to rid himself of the atmosphere of the museum, where the beads  which should be jangling on a brown neck are lying numbered and labelled  on red velvet; where the bird-trap, once the centre of such feathered  commotion, is propped up in a glass case as \"D, 18,432\"; and where even  the document in which the verses are written is the lawful booty of the  grammarian and philologist in the library. But it is the first duty of  an archaeologist to do away with that atmosphere.    Let those who are untrammelled then, pass out into the sunshine of the  Egyptian fields and marshes, where the wild duck cry to each other as  they scuttle through the tall reeds. Here in the early morning comes our  songstress, and one may see her as clearly as one can that Shulamite of  King Solomon's day, who has had the good fortune to belong to a land  where stones and bones, being few in number, do not endanger the  atmosphere of the literature. One may see her, her hair moving in the  breeze \"as a flock of goats that appear from Mount Gilead\"; her teeth  white \"as a flock of shorn sheep which came up from the washing,\" and  her lips \"like a thread of scarlet.\" Through such imaginings alone can  one appreciate the songs, or realise the lightness of the manner in  which they were sung.    With such a happy view of life amongst the upper classes as is  indicated by their philosophy, and with that merry disposition amongst  the peasants which shows itself in their love of song, it is not  surprising to find that asceticism is practically unknown in ancient  Egypt before the time of Christ. At first sight, in reflecting on the  mysteries and religious ceremonies of the nation, we are apt to endow  the priests and other participators with a degree of austerity wholly  unjustified by facts. We picture the priest chanting his formulae in the  dim light of the temple, the atmosphere about him heavy with incense;  and we imagine him as an anchorite who has put away the things of this  world. But in reality there seems to have been not even such a thing as  a celibate amongst the priests. Each man had his wife and his family,  his house, and his comforts of food and fine linen. He indulged in the  usual pastimes and was present at the merriest of feasts. The famous  wise men and magicians, such as Uba-ana of the Westcar Papyrus, had  their wives, their parks, their pleasure-pavilions, and their hosts of  servants. Great dignitaries of the Amon Church, such as Amenhotepsase,  the Second Prophet of Amen in the time of Thutmosis IV., are represented  as feasting with their friends, or driving through Thebes in  richly-decorated chariots drawn by prancing horses, and attended by an  array of servants. A monastic life, or the life of an anchorite, was  held by the Egyptians in scorn; and indeed the state of mind which  produces the monk"]]]
