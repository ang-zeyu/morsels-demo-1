The most thoro scholars  have found this task no easy affair. Most grammarians have let it pass  unobserved; but every person has seen the necessity of some explanation  upon this point, to afford a means of ascertaining the etymological  derivation and meaning of these words. I would here enter farther into  this subject, but I am reminded that I am surpassing the limits set me  for this course of lectures.    The attention I have bestowed on this part of the present subject, will  not be construed into a mere verbal criticism. It has been adopted to  show you how, in the definition or description of things, the mind  clings to one thing to gain some information concerning another. When we  find a thing unlike any thing else we have ever known, in form, in size,  in color, in every thing; we should find it a difficult task, if not an  impossibility, to describe it to another in a way to give any correct  idea of it. Having never seen its like before, we can say little of its  character. We may give it a _name_, but that would not be understood. We  could say it was as large as--no, it had no size; that it was like--but  no, it had no likeness; that it resembled--no, it had no resemblance.  How could we describe it? What could we say of it? Nothing at all.    What idea could the Pacha of Egypt form of ice, having never seen any  till the french chemists succeeded in freezing water in his presence?  They told him of ice; that it was _cold_; that it would freeze; that  whole streams were often frozen over, so that men and teams could walk  over them. He believed no such thing--it was a \"christian lie.\" This  idea was confirmed on the first trial of the chemists, which failed of  success. But when, on the second attempt, they succeeded, he was all in  raptures. A new field was open before him. New ideas were produced in  his mind. New qualities were learned; and he could now form some idea of  the _ice_ bergs of the north; of _frozen_ regions, which he had never  seen; of _icy_ hearts, and storms of _frozen_ rain.    We often hear it said, such a man is very _stoical_; another is an  _epicurean_; and another is a _bacchanal_, or _bacchanalian_. But what  idea should we form of such persons, if we had never read of the Stoics  and their philosophy; of Epicurus and his notions of happiness and  duty; or of Bacchus, the god of wine and revelry, whose annual feasts,  or Dionysia, were celebrated with the most extravagant licentiousness  thro out Greece and Rome, till put down by the Senate of the latter.    You can not fail to see the importance of the knowledge on which we here  insist. The meaning you attach to words is exceedingly diverse; and  hence you are not always able to think alike, or understand each other,  nor derive the same sentiment from the same language. The contradictory  opinions which exist in the world may be accounted for, in a great  measure, in this way. Our knowledge of many things of which we speak, is  limited, either from lack of means, or disposition to employ them.  People always differ and contend most about things of which they know  the least. Did we all attach the same meaning to the same words, our  opinions would all be the same, as true as the forty-fifth problem of  Euclid. How important, then, that children should always be taught the  same meaning of words, and learn to use them correctly. Etymology,  viewed in this light, is a most important branch of science.    Whenever a word is sufficiently understood, no adjective should be  connected with it. There is a ridiculous practice among many people, of  appending to every noun one or more adjectives, which have no other  effect than to expose their own folly. Some writers are so in the habit  of annexing adjectives to all nouns, that they dare not use one without.  You will not unfrequently see adjectives different in form, added to a  noun of very similar meaning; as, sad melancholy, an ominous sign, this  mundane earth, pensive thoughts.    When words can be obtained, which not only name the object, but also  describe its properties, it should be preferred to a noun with an  adjective; as _pirate_, for _sea robber_; _savan_, for a _learned_ or  _wise man_.[4]    In relation to that class of adjectives derived from verbs, we will be  brief. They include what have been termed participles, not a distinct  \"part of speech,\" but by some included in the verbs. We use them as  adjectives to describe things as standing in some relation to other  things on the account of the action expressed by the verb from which  they are derived. \"The man is respected.\" _Respected_, in this case,  describes the man in such a relation to those who have become acquainted  with his good qualities, that he now receives their respect. He is  respect_able_, (_able_ to command, or worthy of respect,) and of course,  respected for his respectability. To avoid repetition, we select  different words to assist in the expression of a complex idea. But I  indulge in phrases like the above, to show the nice shades of meaning in  the common use of words, endeavoring to analyze, as far as possible, our  words and thoughts, and show their mutual connexion and dependencies.    What has been termed the \"present participle\" is also an adjective,  describing things in their present condition in reference to actions.  \"The man is writing.\" Here, _writing_ describes the man in his present  employment. But the consideration of this matter more properly belongs  to the construction of sentences.           *       *       *       *       *    There is another class or variety of words properly belonging to this  division of grammar, which may as well be noticed in this place as any  other. I allude to those words generally called \"Prepositions.\" We have  not time now to consider them at large, but will give you a brief view  of our opinion of them, and reserve the remainder of our remarks till we  come to another part of these lectures.    Most of the words called prepositions, in books of grammar, are  participles, derived from verbs, many of which are still in use, but  some are obsolete. They are used in the true character of adjectives,  _describing one thing by its relation to another_. But their meaning has  not been generally understood. Our dictionaries have afforded no means  by which we can trace their etymology. They have been regarded as a kind  of cement to stick other words together, having no meaning or importance  in themselves.[5] Until their meaning is known, we can not reasonably  expect to draw them from their hiding places, and give them a  respectable standing in the transmission of thought.    Many words, from the frequency of their use, fail to attract our  attention as much as those less employed; not because they are less  important, but because they are so familiarly known that the operations  of thought are not observed in the choice made of them to express ideas.  If we use words of which little is known, we ponder well before we adopt  them, to determine whether the sense usually attached to them accords  exactly with the notions we desire to convey by them. The same can not  be said of small words which make up a large proportion of our language,  and are, in fact, more necessary than the others, in as much as their  meaning is more generally known. Those who employ carriages to convey  their bodies, observe little of their construction, unless there is  something singular or fine in their appearance. The common parts are  unobserved, yet as important as the small words used in the common  construction of language, the vehicle of thought. As the apostle says of  the body politic, \"those members of the body, which seem to be more  feeble, are necessary;\" so the words least understood by grammarians are  most necessary in the correct formation of language.    It is an easy matter to get along with the words called prepositions,  after they are all learned by rote; but when their meaning and use are  inquired into, the best grammarians have little to say of them.    A list of prepositions, alphabetically arranged, is found in nearly  every grammar, which scholars are required to commit to memory, without  knowing any thing of their meaning or use, only that they are  prepositions when an objective word comes after them, _because the books  say so_; but occasionally the same words occur as adverbs and  adjectives. There is, however, no trouble in \"parsing\" them, unless the  list is forgotten. In that case, you will see the pupil, instead of  inquiring after the meaning and duty of the word, go to the book and  search for it in the lists of prepositions or conjunctions; or to the  dictionary, to see if there is a \"_prep._\" appended to it. What will  children ever learn of language in this way? Of what avail is all such  grammar teaching? As soon as they leave school it is all forgotten; and  you will hear them say, at the very time they should be reaping the  harvest of former toil, that they once understood grammar, but it is all  gone from them. Poor souls! their memory is very treacherous, else they  have never learned language as they ought. There is a fault somewhere.  To us it is not difficult to determine where it is.    That certain words are prepositions, there can be no doubt, because the  books say they are; but _why_ they are so, is quite another matter. All  we desire is to have their meaning understood. Little difficulty will  then be found in determining their use.    I have said they are derived from verbs, many of which are obsolete.  Some are still in use, both as verbs and nouns. Take for example the  word =with=.

This comparison is not just in any of its parts. God presides over  a machine, of which He has made all the springs; these springs act  according to the way in which God has formed them; it is the fault of  His inaptitude if these springs do not contribute to the harmony of the  machine in which the workman desired to place them. God is a creating  King, who created all kinds of subjects for Himself; who formed them  according to His pleasure, and whose wishes can never find any  resistance. If God in His empire has rebellious subjects, it is God who  resolved to have rebellious subjects. If the sins of men disturb the  order of the world, it is God who desired this order to be disturbed.  Nobody dares to doubt Divine justice; however, under the empire of a  just God, we find nothing but injustice and violence. Power decides the  fate of nations. Equity seems to be banished from the earth; a small  number of men enjoy with impunity the repose, the fortunes, the liberty,  and the life of all the others. Everything is in disorder in a world  governed by a God of whom it is said that disorder displeases Him  exceedingly.          LXXXVII.--MEN'S PRAYERS TO GOD PROVE SUFFICIENTLY THAT THEY ARE NOT  SATISFIED WITH THE DIVINE ECONOMY.    Although men incessantly admire the wisdom the goodness, the justice,  the beautiful order of Providence, they are, in fact, never contented  with it. The prayers which they continually offer to Heaven, prove to us  that they are not at all satisfied with God's administration. Praying to  God, asking a favor of Him, is to mistrust His vigilant care; to pray  God to avert or to suppress an evil, is to endeavor to put obstacles in  the way of His justice; to implore the assistance of God in our  calamities, means to appeal to the very author of these calamities in  order to represent to Him our welfare; that He ought to rectify in our  favor His plan, which is not beneficial to our interests. The optimist,  or the one who thinks that everything is good in the world, and who  repeats to us incessantly that we live in the best world possible, if he  were consistent, ought never to pray; still less should he expect  another world where men will be happier. Can there be a better world  than the best possible of all worlds? Some of the theologians have  treated the optimists as impious for having claimed that God could not  have made a better world than the one in which we live; according to  these doctors it is limiting the Divine power and insulting it. But do  not theologians see that it is less offensive for God, to pretend that  He did His best in creating the world, than to say that He, having the  power to produce a better one, had the malice to make a very bad one? If  the optimist, by his system, does wrong to the Divine power, the  theologian, who treats him as impious, is himself a reprobate, who  wounds the Divine goodness under pretext of taking interest in God.          LXXXVIII.--THE REPARATION OF THE INIQUITIES AND THE MISERIES OF THIS  WORLD IN ANOTHER WORLD, IS AN IDLE CONJECTURE AND AN ABSURD SUPPOSITION.    When we complain of the evils of which this world is the theater, we are  referred to another world; we are told that there God will repair all  the iniquities and the miseries which He permits for a time here below.  However, if leaving His eternal justice to sleep for a time, God could  consent to evil during the period of the existence of our globe, what  assurance have we that during the existence of another globe, Divine  justice will not likewise sleep during the misfortunes of its  inhabitants? They console us in our troubles by saying, that God is  patient, and that His justice, although often very slow, is not the less  certain. But do you not see, that patience can not be suited to a being  just, immutable, and omnipotent? Can God tolerate injustice for an  instant? To temporize with an evil that one knows of, evinces either  uncertainty, weakness, or collusion; to tolerate evil which one has the  power to prevent, is to consent that evil should be committed.          LXXXIX.--THEOLOGY JUSTIFIES THE EVIL AND INJUSTICE PERMITTED BY ITS GOD,  ONLY BY CONCEDING TO THIS GOD THE RIGHT OF THE STRONGEST, THAT IS TO  SAY, THE VIOLATION OF ALL RIGHTS, OR IN COMMANDING FROM MEN A STUPID  DEVOTION.    I hear a multitude of theologians tell me on all sides, that God is  infinitely just, but that His justice is not that of men! Of what kind,  or of what nature is this Divine justice then? What idea can I form of a  justice which so often resembles human injustice? Is it not confounding  all our ideas of justice and of injustice, to tell us that what is  equitable in God is iniquitous in His creatures? How can we take as a  model a being whose Divine perfections are precisely contrary to human  perfections? God, you say, is the sovereign arbiter of our destinies;  His supreme power, that nothing can limit, authorizes Him to do as He  pleases with His works; a worm, such as man, has not the right to murmur  against Him. This arrogant tone is literally borrowed from the language  which the ministers of tyrants hold, when they silence those who suffer  by their violences; it can not, then, be the language of the ministers  of a God of whose equity they boast. It can not impose upon a being who  reasons. Ministers of a just God! I tell you then, that the greatest  power is not able to confer even upon your God Himself the right to be  unjust to the vilest of His creatures. A despot is not a God. A God who  arrogates to Himself the right to do evil, is a tyrant; a tyrant is not  a model for men. He ought to be an execrable object in their eyes. Is it  not strange that, in order to justify Divinity, they made of Him the  most unjust of beings? As soon as we complain of His conduct, they think  to silence us by claiming that God is the Master; which signifies that  God, being the strongest, He is not subjected to ordinary rules. But the  right of the strongest is the violation of all rights; it can pass as a  right but in the eyes of a savage conqueror, who, in the intoxication of  his fury, imagines he has the right to do as he pleases with the  unfortunate ones whom he has conquered; this barbarous right can appear  legitimate only to slaves, who are blind enough to think that everything  is allowed to tyrants, who are too strong for them to resist.    By a foolish simplicity, or rather by a plain contradiction of terms, do  we not see devotees exclaim, amidst the greatest calamities, that the  good Lord is the Master? Well, illogical reasoners, you believe in good  faith that the good Lord sends you the pestilence; that your good Lord  gives war; that the good Lord is the cause of famine; in a word, that  the good Lord, without ceasing to be good, has the will and the right to  do you the greatest evils you can endure! Cease to call your Lord good  when He does you harm; do not say that He is just; say that He is the  strongest, and that it is impossible for you to avert the blows which  His caprice inflicts upon you. God, you say, punishes us for our highest  good; but what real benefit can result to a nation in being exterminated  by contagion, murdered by wars, corrupted by the examples of perverse  masters, continually pressed by the iron scepter of merciless tyrants,  subjected to the scourge of a bad government, which often for centuries  causes nations to suffer its destructive effects? The eyes of faith must  be strange eyes, if we see by their means any advantage in the most  dreadful miseries and in the most durable evils, in the vices and  follies by which our kind is so cruelly afflicted!          XC.--REDEMPTION, AND THE CONTINUAL EXTERMINATIONS ATTRIBUTED TO JEHOVAH  IN THE BIBLE, ARE SO MANY ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS INVENTIONS WHICH  PRESUPPOSE AN UNJUST AND BARBAROUS GOD.    What strange ideas of the Divine justice must the Christians have who  believe that their God, with the view of reconciling Himself with  mankind, guilty without knowledge of the fault of their parents,  sacrificed His own innocent and sinless Son! What would we say of a  king, whose subjects having revolted against him, in order to appease  himself could find no other expedient than to put to death the heir to  his crown, who had taken no part in the general rebellion? It is, the  Christian will say, through kindness for His subjects, incapable of  satisfying themselves of His Divine justice, that God consented to the  cruel death of His Son. But the kindness of a father to strangers does  not give him the right to be unjust and cruel to his son. All the  qualities that theology gives to its God annul each other. The exercise  of one of His perfections is always at the expense of another.    Has the Jew any more rational ideas than the Christian of Divine  justice? A king, by his pride, kindles the wrath of Heaven. Jehovah  sends pestilence upon His innocent people; seventy thousand subjects are  exterminated to expiate the fault of  a monarch that the kindness of God  resolved to spare.          XCI.--HOW CAN WE DISCOVER A TENDER, GENEROUS, AND EQUITABLE FATHER IN A  BEING WHO HAS CREATED HIS CHILDREN BUT TO MAKE THEM UNHAPPY?    In spite of the injustice with which all religions are pleased to  blacken the Divinity, men can not consent to accuse Him of iniquity;  they fear that He, like the tyrants of this world, will be offended by  the truth, and redouble the weight of His malice and tyranny upon them.  They listen, then, to their priests, who tell them that their God is a  tender Father; that this God is an equitable Monarch, whose object in  this world is to assure Himself of the love, obedience, and respect of  His subjects; who gives them the liberty to act, in order to give them  occasion to deserve His favors and to acquire eternal happiness, which  He"]]]
