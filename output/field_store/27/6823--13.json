A committee of investigation was appointed which proceeded  perfunctorilly for about a year. The senator was never expelled but any  influence he may have had and any power to hamper the activities of the  government, were effectually killed for the duration of the war. The  suppression of the senator did not proceed so much from congress or the  White House, as from the press of the country. Without regard to views  or party, the newspapers of the nation voluntarily and patriotically  entered what has been termed a \"conspiracy of silence\" regarding the  activities of the Wisconsin senator. By refusing to print his name or  give him any sort of publicity he was effectively sidetracked and in a  short time the majority of the people of the country forgot his  existence. It was a striking demonstration that propaganda depends for  its effectiveness upon publicity, and has given rise to an order of  thought which contends that the newspapers should censor their own  columns and suppress movements that are detrimental or of evil tendency,  by ignoring them. Opposed to this is the view that the more publicity a  movement gets, and the fuller and franker the discussion it evokes, the  more quickly will its merits or demerits become apparent.    If any evidence was lacking of German duplicity, violation of promises  and general double-dealing, it came to light in the famous document  known as the \"Zimmermann Note\" which came into the hands of the American  state department and was revealed February 28. It was a confidential  communication from Dr. Alfred Zimmermann, German Foreign Minister,  addressed to the German Minister in Mexico and proposed an alliance of  Germany, Mexico and Japan against the United States. Its text follows:         \"On the 1st of February we intend to begin submarine warfare       unrestricted. In spite of this it is our intention to endeavor to       keep neutral the United States of America. If this attempt is not       successful, we propose an alliance on the following basis with       Mexico: That we shall make war together and together make peace. We       shall give general financial support, and it is understood that       Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in New Mexico, Texas and       Arizona. The details are left to you for settlement. You are       instructed to inform the president of Mexico of the above in the       greatest confidence as soon as it is certain there will be an       outbreak of war with the United States, and suggest that the       president of Mexico on his own initiative, should communicate with       Japan suggesting adherence at once to this plan; at the same time       offer to mediate between Germany and Japan. Please call to the       attention of the President of Mexico that the employment of       ruthless submarine warfare now promises to compel England to make       peace in a few months.\"    The American steamers City of Memphis, Vigilancia and Illinois had been  sunk and fifteen lives lost in pursuance of the German submarine policy  to torpedo without warning and without any regard to the safety of crews  or passengers, all ships found within the barred zones. The President  could no longer postpone drawing the sword. Being convinced that the  inevitable hour had struck, he proved himself the man of the hour and  acted with energy. A special session of congress was called for April 2.  The day is bound to stand out in history for in the afternoon the  President delivered his famous message asking that war be declared  against Germany. He said that armed neutrality had been found wanting  and in the end would only draw the country into war without its having  the status of a belligerent. One of the striking paragraphs of the  message follows:         \"With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of       the step I am taking, and of the grave responsibility which it       involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my       constitutional duty, I advise that the congress declare the recent       course of the imperial German government to be in fact nothing less       than war against the government and people of the United States;       that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus       been thrust upon it and that it take immediate steps not only to       put the country in a more thorough state of defence, but also to       exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the       government of the German empire to terms and end the war.\"    Congress voted a declaration of war April 6. Only six senators out of a  total of 96, and fifty representatives out of a total of 435, voted  against it. Congress also, at the request of the President, voted for  the creation of a national army and the raising to war strength of the  National Guard, the Marine corps and the Navy. Laws were passed dealing  with espionage, trading with the enemy and the unlawful manufacture and  use of explosives. Provision was made for the insurance of soldiers and  sailors, for priority of shipments, for the seizure and use of enemy  ships in American harbors, for conserving and controlling the food and  fuel supply of the country, for stimulating agriculture, for enlarging  the aviation branch of the service, for extending credit to foreign  governments, for issuing bonds and for providing additional revenues by  increasing old and creating new taxes.    The extra session of congress lasted a few days over six months. In that  time it passed all the above measures and others of less importance. It  authorized the expenditure of over nineteen billions of dollars  ($19,321,225,208). Including the amount appropriated at the second  session of the preceeding congress, the amount reached the unheard of  total of over twenty-one billions of dollars ($21,390,730,940).    German intrigues and German ruthlessness created an additional stench in  the nostrils of civilization when on September 8, the United States made  public the celebrated \"Spurlos Versenkt\" telegram which had come into  its possession. It is a German phrase meaning \"sunk without leaving a  trace\" and was contained in a telegram from Luxburg, the German minister  at Buenos Aires. The telegram (of May 19, 1917) advised that Argentine  steamers \"be spared if possible or else sunk without a trace being  left.\" The advice was repeated July 9. The Swedish minister at Buenos  Aires sent these messages in code as though they were his own private  dispatches.    On August 26, the British Admiralty had communicated to the  International Conference of Merchant Seaman, a statement of the facts in  twelve cases of sinkings during the previous seven months in which it  was shown how \"spurlos versenkt\" was applied. It was shown that in these  cases the submarine commanders had deliberately opened fire on the crews  of the vessels after they had taken to their small boats or had  attempted to dispose of them in some other way.    Within six weeks after the declaration of war our government was  preparing to send troops to France. An expeditionary force comprising  about one division of Regulars was announced May 14. General Pershing  who was to command arrived in England June 8, and in France June 13. The  first body of our troops reached France June 27 and the second a little  later. The safe passage of these troops was remarkable, as their  departure had been made known to Germany through her spies, and  submarines laid in wait for the transports. The vigilance of our  convoying agencies continued throughout the war and was one of the high  spots of excellence reached in our part of the struggle. Of a total of  over 2,000,000 soldiers transported to France and many thousands  returned on account of sickness and furloughs, only 661 were lost as a  direct result of German submarine operations.    On December 7, the United States declared war against Austria-Hungary.  This was largely on the insistence of Italy and was valuable and  gratifying to that ally.    President Wilson on December 26, issued a proclamation taking over the  railroads of the country, W.G. McAdoo was appointed director general.  The proclamation went into effect two days later and the entire rail  transportation system, for the first time in the history of the nation,  passed under the control and management of the government.    Excepting the revolution in Russia which led to the abdication of Czar  Nicholas II (March 11-15) and so disorganized the country that it never  figured effectively in the war afterwards, the year was one of distinct  advantage to the Allies.    Kut el Amara was retaken by the British February 24. Bagdad fell to the  same forces March 11. From March 17th to 19th the Germans retired to the  \"Hindenburg Line\" evacuating a strip of territory in France 100 miles  long and averaging 13 miles in width, from Arras to Soissons. Between  April 9 and May 14, the British had important successes in the Battle of  Arras, capturing Vimy Ridge April 9. Between April 16 and May 6 the  French made gains in the Battle of the Aisne, between Soissons and  Reims. Between May 15 and September 15 occurred an Italian offensive in  which General Cadorna inflicted severe defeats on the Austrians on the  Carso and Bainsizza plateaus.    The British blew up Messines Ridge, south of Ypres, June 7 and captured  7,500 German prisoners. June 12 King Constantine of Greece was forced to  abdicate and on June 29, Greece entered the war on the side of the  Allies. A mutiny in the German fleet at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel occurred  July 30 and a second mutiny September 2.    August 20-24 the French recaptured high ground at Verdun, lost in 1916.  October 23-26 a French drive north of the Aisne won important positions  including Malmaison fort. The Germans retreated from the Chemin de  Dames, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1662"],[0,"The 1997 CIA World Factbook (#14)"],[1,"raising    Exports:  total value : $47 million (f.o.b., 1995)  commodities: electricity, tobacco products, furniture  partners : France 49%, Spain 47%    Imports:  total value: $1 billion (1995)  commodities: consumer goods, food  partners: France, Spain, US 4.2%    Debt - external: $NA    Economic aid: none    Currency: 1 French franc (F) = 100 centimes; 1 peseta (Pta) = 100  centimos; the French and Spanish currencies are used    Exchange rates: French francs (F) per US$1 - 5.4169 (January 1997),  5.1155 (1996), 4.9915 (1995), 5.5520 (1994), 5.6632 (1993), 5.2938  (1992); Spanish pesetas (Ptas) per US$1 - 134.77 (January 1997),  126.66 (1996), 124.69 (1995), 133.96 (1994), 127.26 (1993), 102.38  (1992)    Fiscal year: calendar year    @Andorra:Communications    Telephones: 21,258 (1983 est.)

A cease-fire lasted from 31 May 1991  until October 1992 when the insurgent National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola (UNITA) refused to accept its defeat in  internationally monitored elections and fighting resumed throughout  much of the countryside. The two sides signed another peace accord on  20 November 1994 and the cease-fire is generally holding, but military  tensions persist and banditry is increasing. In order to bring armed  insurgents under government control the peace accord of 20 November  1994 provided for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the  Angolan armed forces. Military integration began in June 1996 and a  Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was installed in April  1997. Efforts which began in May 1997 to extend government into  UNITA-occupied areas are proceeding slowly. The original 7,200-man UN  peacekeeping force began a phased drawdown in late 1996. All UN  peacekeepers are scheduled to depart by September 1997 but a small UN  military observer force will probably remain in Angola through 1998.    @Angola:Geography    Location: Southern Africa, bordering the South Atlantic Ocean, between  Namibia and Democratic Republic of the Congo    Geographic coordinates: 12 30 S, 18 30 E    Map references: Africa    Area:  total: 1,246,700 sq km  land : 1,246,700 sq km  water: 0 sq km    Area - comparative: slightly less than twice the size of Texas    Land boundaries:  total: 5,198 km  border countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo 2,511 km of which  220 km is the boundary of discontiguous Cabinda province, Republic of  the Congo 201 km, Namibia 1,376 km, Zambia 1,110 km    Coastline: 1,600 km    Maritime claims:  exclusive fishing zone: 200 nm  territorial sea: 20 nm    Climate: semiarid in south and along coast to Luanda; north has cool,  dry season (May to October) and hot, rainy season (November to April)    Terrain: narrow coastal plain rises abruptly to vast interior plateau    Elevation extremes:  lowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m  highest point: Morro de Moco 2,620 m    Natural resources: petroleum, diamonds, iron ore, phosphates, copper,  feldspar, gold, bauxite, uranium    Land use:  arable land: 2%  permanent crops: 0%  permanent pastures: 23%  forests and woodland: 43%  other : 32% (1993 est.)
