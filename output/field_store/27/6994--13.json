Meanwhile the  hundred-headed adder, being unable any longer to endure the pain the  gods and giants inflicted on him, vomited poison upon the giants,  which killed many of them on the spot. Vixnu afterwards assumed the  form of a beautiful woman, and such of the giants as remained alive  fell in love with the fair being. In this guise, he amused the giants  till the gods had eaten all the butter.    In his third incarnation, Vixnu changed himself into the form of a  hog, in consequence of the following circumstance:--One day a contest  arose between the three gods, Bruma, Vixnu, and Rutrem, regarding the  extent of their power. Rutrem undertook to go and hide himself, and at  the same time promised to submit himself to him who should first  discover his head and feet; but if they could not find these parts,  then the baffled gods were to acknowledge him their superior. Bruma  and Vixnu having agreed to this proposal, Rutrem vanished, and hid his  head and feet in places a great distance from each other, where he  imagined they could not be found. Bruma, in the likeness of a swan,  commenced to search for the head, but, finding he could not obtain any  trace of it, he resolved to return home. Just, however, as he was  going to give up the search, he met the thistle flower, which came and  saluted him, and showed the place where Rutrem had hid his head.  Rutrem, exasperated, cursed the flower, and forbade it ever to enter  his presence. For this reason, his followers prevented thistles being  brought into their temples in any part of the East Indies.    For the purpose of finding the feet, Vixnu transformed himself into a  hog, and went from place to place digging into the earth, but without  success. For cogent reasons, Vixnu next assumed the form of a man and  lion at the same time. Rutrem, it appears, conceived a strong  friendship for one Iranien, a mighty giant, and granted him the  privilege that no one should kill him either by day or by night.  Instead of the giant proving grateful, he became proud and  overbearing, and even insisted on being worshipped as a god. To punish  the giant, Vixnu suddenly appeared before him in the form of a cloud,  and then, taking the monster shape of a being half-man half-lion,  resolved to take vengeance on the ungrateful wretch. In the evening,  when Iranien was standing at the threshold of his door, Vixnu sprang  at him, tore him to pieces, and drank his blood. But the blood  affected Vixnu so much that he became stupid. Vixnu's fifth  transformation was into a dwarf. At that time a cruel king's subjects  appealed to Vixnu to relieve them of their oppressor, and, to carry  out the people's desire, he, in the form of a dwarf, went to the city  where the tyrant kept court. The dwarf begged from the king a grant of  three feet of ground whereon to build himself a house. The tyrant was  about to comply with the request, when the morning star, which  attended the king in the character of secretary of state, suspected  there was treason in the case. It was common, when requests were  granted, for the king to take water into his mouth and pour some of it  into the hand of the suppliant, and therefore the secretary, by the  assistance of magic, slipped imperceptibly down the prince's throat,  in order to prevent the water being thrown out. The magic had not the  desired effect; for the king, finding something in his throat, forced  a sharp instrument into it, which put out one of the secretary's eyes,  and the water gushed out, ratifying the agreement. Vixnu changed  himself into a monster so large that the whole earth was not  sufficient to afford room for his feet. He then said to the king, \"You  have given me three feet of earth, and yet the whole world can  scarcely contain one of my feet: where am I to place the other?\" The  tyrant, seeing deserved wrath awaiting him, laid his head down before  Vixnu, who with one kick tossed it into the lowest abyss of hell. The  wretched king, finding himself condemned to such a place of torment,  begged pardon and mercy of Vixnu, but all the favour he received was  one day's respite every year, to enable him to take part at a  particular ceremony, to be observed in commemoration of his own  downfall and punishment.    Vixnu's sixth form was that of a white man. He subdued many tyrants,  and washed his hands in their blood. In this form he destroyed many  giants, and compelled all the apes in the country to attend him. The  last form Vixnu assumed was that of a black man, in which likeness his  cunning and success were not less marked than when he was disguised in  several of his former shapes. Here is another story told of  him:--There was a great tyrant named Campsen, a violent persecutor of  good men, who had a sister called Exudi. It happened that the  soothsayers, of whom there were many in the country, having consulted  the stars, told the king that Exudi would have eight children, and  that the youngest of them would kill him. This enraged the monarch so  much that he destroyed seven of her children as soon as they were  born. Notwithstanding the natural affliction of the princess, she  became pregnant for the eighth time, but, wonderful to relate, of no  less a personage than the god Vixnu, who, unknown to her, succeeded in  finding a place in her womb. Fearing the child would be conveyed  beyond his reach as soon as it was born, the king placed spies  everywhere to prevent the young prince's escape. The supposed father  of the child succeeded in carrying him away, and placing him under the  care of shepherds far up the mountains. Every effort was made by the  baffled monarch to discover the young prince, and at last he found  him. Desiring to be the executioner himself, he went and laid hold of  the child to murder him. Just as the hand was raised to inflict the  fatal blow, the prince vanished, and in his room appeared a little  girl, whom the tyrant also attempted to kill; but she too, after  mocking the king, disappeared uninjured. Vixnu grew from boyhood to  manhood, when he raised an army against Campsen, whom he defeated and  slew with his own hands, fulfilling the prediction of the soothsayers.  Vixnu married two wives, but, neither of them pleasing him, he  divorced them and espoused sixteen thousand shepherdesses. The people  imagined that he would appear some time or another in the form of a  horse, but thought that until that metamorphosis took place he would  wallow in a sea of milk, with his head supported by a beautiful snake.    We are informed that Rutrem, the third son of Paraxacti, was much  respected by the people, though, judging from the accounts transmitted  to us, the wonder is that he was not detested. He married Parvardi,  daughter of a king, whose dominion was in the mountains, with whom he  lived a thousand years; but his two brothers, Bruma and Vixnu, having  disapproved of the match, gathered together the thirty thousand  millions of gods, and went in search of him. Accordingly he was found  and dragged away from his wife, which caused him to wander up and down  the earth in search of forbidden pleasures. One day the earth gave him  a son with seven heads; but as a nurse could not be got to bring up  the child, the seven stars undertook the task. Parvardi, disconsolate  at the loss of her husband, went in search of him, but could not  discover his place of abode. In her lonely state, she begged the gods  would give her a son,--a request that was complied with, for a  man-child dropped out of the sweat of her forehead. In the meantime  Rutrem returned to his house, and, finding the child, became  exceedingly enraged. His anger, however, turned into love on being  informed of the miraculous manner in which he was born. The king of  the mountains made a feast, to which the gods were invited, but  Rutrem, his son-in-law, was not asked. This want of respect provoked  him so much that he went to the banquet, and, laying hold of one of  the gods, tore off a handful of hair from his head. From the hair a  giant of enormous size started up, whose head reached to the  firmament, and struck the sun with so great violence that all its  teeth were knocked out. For this reason, the Indians refused to offer  anything to the sun but what could be eaten without teeth. Not  satisfied with knocking out the teeth of the sun, he bruised the moon  so severely that the marks remain to the present day. He then killed  several of the guests, among whom was his step-son, created from the  sweat of his mother's forehead. Vinayaguien (that was the youth's  name) lost his head, and had it replaced with that of an elephant. In  the disfigured state into which he was turned, his father dispatched  him in search of a wife as beautiful as his mother,--a task that  proved endless, because there could not be found a woman equal in  beauty to his maternal parent.    Rutrem married the River Ganges, which was represented under the form  of a blooming woman. At that time there was a giant named Piamejuran,  who had for several years undergone a severe penance for having  offended Rutrem, but, becoming sensible of his offence, desired to be  absolved. The favour was granted him, with the privilege of reducing  to ashes everything he laid his hands upon. The power with which he  was endowed proved his death. One day he went to the Ganges to bathe,  and, lifting his hand to his forehead, it reduced him to dust.    At their marriages, the Indians were very superstitious, and paid  great regard to omens. The consent of the parents being obtained, and  a fortunate day appointed, the parties met with the relations, when  the bridegroom threw three handfuls of rice on the head of the bride,  and she cast an equal quantity at him. Part of the marriage ceremony  consisted of the fathers of both bridegroom and bride putting a piece  of money and a small quantity of water into the bride's hand. This  being done, the bridegroom hung a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#14)"],[1," sei Dank! they let me go, glowering at me  as if they were still sure I was somehow tricking them. And here I  am--alive!\"    Friedrich's ludicrous recital, embellished by a hundred gestures and  poses, had raised a guffaw even in Villa Elsa.          Chapter XVI    A LIVELY MUSICIAN      Gard discovered that such mockery or berating of military officials,  with whom the ordinary public came in servile contact, was rather  common in Germany in spite of the universal adoration of the army.    Intermixed with Friedrich's take-off were his moments of \"the grand  manner,\" appropriate to a musical director who is born to command  fickle or imperious singers and musicians. He was naturally an  actor. His refreshing mimicries amused Gard. Against the bovine  background of the Villa Elsa circle, he stood out in relief as an  enlivening figure with flitting phases of elegance.    He was clever, talented. He spun off a lot of new music at the  piano, much of it coming from his own pen. Elsa hung absorbed over  the wing of the instrument. Friedrich, of about Kirtley's age but  adequately equipped and ambitious, was aspiring to some one of the  dignified thrones in the musical kingdom of Germany. Gard was only  just hatching out as a man. He was essentially but a lad grown up.  Von Tielitz showed already a wholly developed maturity. German  instruction again versus American education!    Friedrich was better versed in English than the Bucher children. He  paid two calls on Gard that first day. Talking Anglo-Saxon was good  practice. On the second call he discharged a missile that struck  Kirtley near the heart, and gave him a feeling of faintness.    \"Don't you like Elsa?\" Von Tielitz whipped out with no preamble.  \"She is really a nice girl, a very nice girl. Her family thinks we  are to marry. Well, perhaps. I don't know. Sometimes I think yes.  Sometimes I think no. There are so many others, don't you know. But  I think we will marry as soon as I get my Kapellmeistership. We are  always such good friends. She used to sit on my lap before I went  away. O! we are _very_ good friends. But now I am not so much in  Dresden and, my dear Mr. Kirtley, my poor Kapellmeistership does not  come along. It is most aggravating, as you say in English. I get so  discouraged.\"    He brightened again.    \"They tell me you and Elsa have been playing duos. Such good  training. Very agreeable. We used to play together also. A nice girl  to rub one's knees against under the piano--oh,        \"I am Titania the blond,       Titania, of the air!\"    Friedrich twittered gayly the lines from \"Mignon.\" Then he abruptly  changed.    \"But I have now so little time for serious maidens. Ach Himmel! How  I am driven by going here and going there! One says this to me,  another says that to me, and my head gets all in a whirl.\"    So he wandered on with his mixtures of _nonchalance_, condescension  and, above all, his ebullient self-esteem that flowed over on to  everyone to the point of deluging them. When he went away, it was  with such a warm invitation to call upon him the next week that  Kirtley could not but accept. Besides, here was opened up a novel  and suggestive line of behavior from the standpoint of the German  young man of the world.    Gard was left with confused feelings that drooped their wings in  displeasure if not distress. So there was a rival, and of long  standing, on the little rosy sea of his romance! And this was he.  Was it a wonder that Elsa had \"spells\"? Here was a true  heart-breaker. Just the type to play havoc with a girl. What place  was there left for the mild, unpretending Gard? And still she  deserved far better than Von Tielitz. Perhaps it was this feeling  that added to her unhappiness. His vulgarity! To talk as Von Tielitz  did about one who might become his wife, and to a stranger, was a  new form of German brutality. It steadied and deepened Gard's  admiration for her. Who ever heard a young Yankee speak like this  about his serious sweetheart? However raw he may be, there is a  certain sacred respect at the bottom of his language about her--his  bearing toward her.    Elsa did not appear at meals for a day or two after Friedrich left.  Kirtley was not encouraged by learning that this usually happened  after a call from the composer. He thought it strange that the Frau,  with all her plain speech and hardy lack of sentiment, still made  no reference to her daughter's trouble. Marriage is to the Germans  such an earth-to-earth affair, as Gard perceived, that he marveled  she did not unbosom herself capaciously about what must be a  mother's anxiety. But the Teuton daughter is like a glove that can  be put on or cast off by the sovereign male. She is meant to be  toughened, exposed to rude blasts, fortified, to be able to support  the draft-mare burdens of Teuton wifehood.          CHAPTER XVII    IMMORALITY AND OBSCENITY      Gard now descended unwittingly into one of the darkest regions of  German life, and one which foreign publics had persistently missed  or voluntarily overlooked in their chorus of approbation of the  race.    It is a familiar dictum that one can judge of a nation pretty fairly  by the position and treatment of its women. Kirtley had never, in  America, heard anything about Deutschland in this light. But he soon  found in Saxony that this was only one of the numerous German topics  on which little publicity was shed in his homeland in spite of the  general emphasis laid on German preeminence. This emphasis was  mainly a diffusion, through mere books of information, about  achievements and an extraordinary condition of learned mentality. Of  the actual inhabitants beyond the Rhine, ignorance was kept  widespread. German femininity was assumed to be of a predominating  excellence to match that of German masculinity.    No study of a people is indeed complete without an unglossed inquiry  into its conduct toward its women and children. To say that the  German's business traits are the same and as reputable as those of  other races, is below the mark. In this secular domain he is  compelled to deal and to act within the accepted formulae of trade.  To do otherwise would be to ostracize himself.    But he is in no such competition or is subject to no such exactions  in his attitude toward his own women and children. With them he does  as he pleases and his real nature stands forth. These truly vital  matters have been passed over as if unnoticed by the world, as has  been said, and still it wonders why it cannot learn what the German  is--does not understand him. He is, perhaps more than anyone, what  he is toward his own inferiors--toward those who are weaker and  dependent.    The question of German womanhood and girlhood should not therefore  be blinked by the earnest contemplator. It was not long before Gard  was saying to himself that if Americans could be made to realize  the status of womankind in Deutschland, they would not be so lured  by the idea of sending their young folk thither for education. There  would be a marked decline in their generous enthusiasm for _all_  things German. In what civilized land does woman lead less in lofty,  sublimated power or put a fainter stamp on the talents of the race?  German art, music, poetry, language, politics, education, all are  distinctively masculine. The Teuton woman merely partakes of the  life of man, the ideal. She does not assume to lead him. She would  seem so far below par that, as Gard had seen, even flirtation  scarcely exists in Deutschland. Flirtation is particularly a custom  among equals.    When he returned Friedrich's visits as promised, he found him  sharing the room of his friend Karl Messer. Messer was a successful  architect who had already secured a Government commission while the  equally youthful Kirtley--may it be repeated--had not begun real  life and, according to the American plan, could do nothing very  well. Those two room-mates and cronies were leading the typical  Teuton existence of youths who combined proficient work with a frank  sensuality accompanied, of course, by much imbibing in the German  way. And it may be preliminarily noted that what explorations Gard  afterward made in this great and seamy side of Teuton nature,  likewise ended in a downward direction toward depths that he had  scarcely thought possible in the educated human.    Von Tielitz and Messer had been at an uproarious ball the night  before and were idling about, recuperating. They had accomplished  the ruin there of two girls, which they looked upon as truly manly  sport. Assuming that Kirtley, as must be the case with all young  men, was equally interested with them in being satyrs, they lost no  time in trying to entertain him with their adventures.    The pursuit of woman! In Germany this is not very difficult, as she  is not visibly unhappy to consider herself the legitimate prey of  the lordly sex. This idea runs naturally and powerfully throughout  the Teuton scheme. It is not merely that the female is considered to  have a price, but the price must be low, if not a cypher. To German  women the triumphant male is a splendid creature. His acts are  noble. To be hungry, thirsty, sensual are proper, and therefore  candid, attributes in man. In order to subdue the earth, the race  must be prolific, and to be prolific, desires must not be limited or  weakened by pale Puritanisms. That men are normally uncleansed  sewers from which the face need not be averted, was a conception  Kirtley's senses had fallen somewhat foul of in the Bucher home. To  what point this aspect was carried logically outside Villa Elsa, he  was to realize in skirting the openly sensual sides.    The two Germans told of the various girls who had lived with them  when in college. For the frank amatory life of the Teuton student  begins early. Von Tielitz and Messer also boasted of their  present-day mistresses who were so often changed for reasons of  economy. The"]]]
