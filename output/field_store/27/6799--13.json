The windows were very high up; the glass was red, blue, and green, and  the sunlight shone through quite wondrously in all sorts of colors. On  the table stood the most exquisite cherries, and Gerda ate as many as  she chose, for she had permission to do so. While she was eating, the  old woman combed her hair with a golden comb, and her hair curled and  shone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face, which  was so round and so like a rose.    \"I have often longed for such a dear little girl,\" said the old woman.  \"Now you shall see how well we agree together\"; and while she combed  little Gerda's hair, the child forgot her foster-brother Kay more and  more, for the old woman understood magic; but she was no evil being, she  only practised witchcraft a little for her own private amusement, and  now she wanted very much to keep little Gerda. She therefore went out  in the garden, stretched out her crooked stick towards the rose-bushes,  which, beautifully as they were blowing, all sank into the earth and no  one could tell where they had stood. The old woman feared that if Gerda  should see the roses, she would then think of her own, would remember  little Kay, and run away from her.    She now led Gerda into the flower-garden. Oh, what odour and what  loveliness was there! Every flower that one could think of, and of every  season, stood there in fullest bloom; no picture-book could be gayer or  more beautiful. Gerda jumped for joy, and played till the sun set behind  the tall cherry-tree; she then had a pretty bed, with a red silken  coverlet filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and had as pleasant  dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day.    The next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine,  and thus passed away a day. Gerda knew every flower; and, numerous as  they were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting, though she  did not know which. One day while she was looking at the hat of the old  woman painted with flowers, the most beautiful of them all seemed to her  to be a rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat  when she made the others vanish in the earth. But so it is when one's  thoughts are not collected. \"What!\" said Gerda. \"Are there no roses  here?\" and she ran about amongst the flowerbeds, and looked, and looked,  but there was not one to be found. She then sat down and wept; but her  hot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk; and when her warm tears  watered the ground, the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as  when it had been swallowed up. Gerda kissed the roses, thought of her  own dear roses at home, and with them of little Kay.    \"Oh, how long I have stayed!\" said the little girl. \"I intended to look  for Kay! Don't you know where he is?\" she asked of the roses. \"Do you  think he is dead and gone?\"    \"Dead he certainly is not,\" said the Roses. \"We have been in the earth  where all the dead are, but Kay was not there.\"    \"Many thanks!\" said little Gerda; and she went to the other flowers,  looked into their cups, and asked, \"Don't you know where little Kay is?\"    But every flower stood in the sunshine, and dreamed its own fairy tale  or its own story: and they all told her very many things, but not one  knew anything of Kay.    Well, what did the Tiger-Lily say?    \"Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum! Those are the only two tones.  Always bum! Bum! Hark to the plaintive song of the old woman, to the  call of the priests! The Hindoo woman in her long robe stands upon the  funeral pile; the flames rise around her and her dead husband, but the  Hindoo woman thinks on the living one in the surrounding circle; on him  whose eyes burn hotter than the flames--on him, the fire of whose eyes  pierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to  ashes. Can the heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?\"    \"I don't understand that at all,\" said little Gerda.    \"That is my story,\" said the Lily.    What did the Convolvulus say?    \"Projecting over a narrow mountain-path there hangs an old feudal  castle. Thick evergreens grow on the dilapidated walls, and around the  altar, where a lovely maiden is standing: she bends over the railing and  looks out upon the rose. No fresher rose hangs on the branches than she;  no appleblossom carried away by the wind is more buoyant! How her silken  robe is rustling!    \"'Is he not yet come?'\"    \"Is it Kay that you mean?\" asked little Gerda.    \"I am speaking about my story--about my dream,\" answered the  Convolvulus.    What did the Snowdrops say?    \"Between the trees a long board is hanging--it is a swing. Two little  girls are sitting in it, and swing themselves backwards and forwards;  their frocks are as white as snow, and long green silk ribands flutter  from their bonnets. Their brother, who is older than they are, stands up  in the swing; he twines his arms round the cords to hold himself fast,  for in one hand he has a little cup, and in the other a clay-pipe. He is  blowing soap-bubbles. The swing moves, and the bubbles float in charming  changing colors: the last is still hanging to the end of the pipe, and  rocks in the breeze. The swing moves. The little black dog, as light as  a soap-bubble, jumps up on his hind legs to try to get into the swing.  It moves, the dog falls down, barks, and is angry. They tease him; the  bubble bursts! A swing, a bursting bubble--such is my song!\"    \"What you relate may be very pretty, but you tell it in so melancholy a  manner, and do not mention Kay.\"    What do the Hyacinths say?    \"There were once upon a time three sisters, quite transparent, and very  beautiful. The robe of the one was red, that of the second blue, and  that of the third white. They danced hand in hand beside the calm  lake in the clear moonshine. They were not elfin maidens, but mortal  children. A sweet fragrance was smelt, and the maidens vanished in the  wood; the fragrance grew stronger--three coffins, and in them three  lovely maidens, glided out of the forest and across the lake: the  shining glow-worms flew around like little floating lights. Do the  dancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The odour of the flowers says  they are corpses; the evening bell tolls for the dead!\"    \"You make me quite sad,\" said little Gerda. \"I cannot help thinking of  the dead maidens. Oh! is little Kay really dead? The Roses have been in  the earth, and they say no.\"    \"Ding, dong!\" sounded the Hyacinth bells. \"We do not toll for little  Kay; we do not know him. That is our way of singing, the only one we  have.\"    And Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the  shining green leaves.    \"You are a little bright sun!\" said Gerda. \"Tell me if you know where I  can find my playfellow.\"    And the Ranunculus shone brightly, and looked again at Gerda. What  song could the Ranunculus sing? It was one that said nothing about Kay  either.    \"In a small court the bright sun was shining in the first days of  spring. The beams glided down the white walls of a neighbor's house, and  close by the fresh yellow flowers were growing, shining like gold in  the warm sun-rays. An old grandmother was sitting in the air; her  grand-daughter, the poor and lovely servant just come for a short visit.  She knows her grandmother. There was gold, pure virgin gold in that  blessed kiss. There, that is my little story,\" said the Ranunculus.    \"My poor old grandmother!\" sighed Gerda. \"Yes, she is longing for me,  no doubt: she is sorrowing for me, as she did for little Kay. But I  will soon come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use  asking the flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me  nothing.\" And she tucked up her frock, to enable her to run quicker; but  the Narcissus gave her a knock on the leg, just as she was going to  jump over it. So she stood still, looked at the long yellow flower, and  asked, \"You perhaps know something?\" and she bent down to the Narcissus.  And what did it say?    \"I can see myself--I can see myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the  little garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands  now on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives  only in imagination. She pours water out of the teapot over a piece of  stuff which she holds in her hand; it is the bodice; cleanliness is a  fine thing. The white dress is hanging on the hook; it was washed in the  teapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, ties a saffron-colored  kerchief round her neck, and then the gown looks whiter. I can see  myself--I can see myself!\"    \"That's nothing to me,\" said little Gerda. \"That does not concern me.\"  And then off she ran to the further end of the garden.    The gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened,  and the gate opened; and little Gerda ran off barefooted into the wide  world. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she  could run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked  about her, she saw that the summer had passed; it was late in the  autumn, but that one could not remark in the beautiful garden, where  there was always sunshine, and where there were flowers the whole year  round.    \"Dear me, how long I have staid!\" said Gerda. \"Autumn is come. I must  not rest any longer.\" And she got up to go further.    Oh, how tender and wearied her little feet were! All around it looked  so cold and raw: the long willow-leaves were quite yellow, and the fog  dripped from them like water; one leaf fell after the other: the sloes  only stood full of fruit, which set one's teeth on edge. Oh, how dark  and comfortless it was in the dreary world!      FOURTH STORY.

And Samuel said:    \"Look at the man whom the Lord has chosen! There is not another like him  among all the people!\"    And all the people shouted, \"God save the king! Long live the king!\"    Then Samuel told the people what should be the laws for the king and for  the people to obey. He wrote them down in a book, and placed the book  before the Lord. Then Samuel sent the people home; and Saul went back to  his own house at a place called Gibeah; and with Saul went a company of  men to whose hearts God had given a love for the king.    So after three hundred years under the fifteen Judges, Israel now had a  king. But among the people there were some who were not pleased with the  new king, because he was an unknown man from the farm. They said:    \"Can such a man as this save us?\"    They showed no respect to the king, and in their hearts looked down upon  him. But Saul said nothing, and showed his wisdom by appearing not to  notice them. But in another thing he was not so wise. He forgot to heed  the old prophet's advice and instructions about ruling wisely and doing  as the Lord said. It was not long before Samuel told him that he had  disobeyed God and would lose his kingdom.    When Samuel told Saul that the Lord would take away the kingdom from  him, he did not mean that Saul should lose the kingdom at once. He was  no longer God's king; and as soon as the right man in God's sight should  be found, and should be trained for his duty as king, then God would  take away Saul's power, and would give it to the man whom God had  chosen. But it was years before this came to pass.    The Lord said to Samuel: \"Do not weep and mourn any longer over Saul,  for I have refused him as king. Fill the horn with oil, and go to  Bethlehem in Judah. There find a man named Jesse, for I have chosen a  king among his sons.\"    But Samuel knew that Saul would be very angry, if he should learn that  Samuel had named any other man as king. He said to the Lord:    \"How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.\"    The Lord said to Samuel: \"Take a young cow with you; and tell the people  that you have come to make an offering to the Lord. And call Jesse and  his sons to the sacrifice. I will tell you what to do, and you shall  anoint the one whom I name to you.\"    Samuel went over the mountains southward from Ramah to Bethlehem, about  ten miles, leading a cow. The rulers of the town were alarmed at his  coming, for they feared that he had come to judge the people for some  evil-doing. But Samuel said:    \"I have come in peace to make an offering and to hold a feast to the  Lord. Prepare yourselves and come to the sacrifice.\"    And he invited Jesse and his sons to the service. When they came, he  looked at the sons of Jesse very closely. The oldest was named Eliab,  and he was so tall and noble-looking that Samuel thought:    \"Surely this young man must be the one whom God has chosen.\"    But the Lord said to Samuel:    \"Do not look on his face, nor on the height of his body, for I have not  chosen him. Man judges by the outward looks, but God looks at the  heart.\"    Then Jesse's second son, named Abinadab, passed by. And the Lord said:  \"I have not chosen this one.\" Seven young men came and Samuel said:    \"None of these is the man whom God has chosen. Are these all your  children?\"    \"There is one more,\" said Jesse. \"The youngest of all. He is a boy, in  the field caring for the sheep.\"    And Samuel said:    \"Send for him; for we will not sit down until he comes.\" So after a time  the youngest son was brought in. His name was David, a word that means  \"darling,\" and he was a beautiful boy, perhaps fifteen years old, with  fresh cheeks and bright eyes.    As soon as the young David came, the Lord said to Samuel:    \"Arise, anoint him, for this is the one whom I have chosen.\"    Then Samuel poured oil on David's head, in the presence of all his  brothers. But no one knew at that time the anointing to mean that David  was to be the king. Perhaps they thought that David was chosen to be a  prophet like Samuel.    From that time the Spirit of God came upon David, and he began to show  signs of coming greatness. He went back to his sheep on the hillsides  around Bethlehem, but God was with him.    David grew up strong and brave, not afraid of the wild beasts which  prowled around and tried to carry away his sheep. More than once he  fought with lions, and bears, and killed them, when they seized the  lambs of his flock. And David, alone all day, practiced throwing stones  in a sling, until he could strike exactly the place for which he aimed.  When he swung his sling, he knew that the stone would go to the very  spot at which he was throwing it.    [Illustration: _Then Samuel poured oil on David's head_]    And young as he was, David thought of God, and talked with God, and God  talked with David, and showed to David His will.    After Saul had disobeyed the voice of the Lord, the Spirit of the Lord  left Saul, and no longer spoke to him. And Saul became very sad of  heart. At times a madness would come upon him, and at all times he was  very unhappy. The servants of Saul noticed that when some one played on  the harp and sang, Saul's spirit was made more cheerful; and the sadness  of soul left him. At one time Saul said: \"Find some one who can play  well, and bring him to me. Let me listen to music; for it drives away my  sadness.\"    One of the young men said: \"I have seen a young man, a son of Jesse in  Bethlehem, who can play well. He is handsome in his looks, and agreeable  in talking. I have also heard that he is a brave young man, who can  fight as well as he can play, and the Lord is with him.\"    Then Saul sent a message to Jesse, David's father. He said: \"Send me  your son David, who is with the sheep. Let him come and play before me.\"    Then David came to Saul, bringing with him a present for the king from  Jesse. When Saul saw him, he loved him, as did everybody who saw the  young David. And David played on the harp, and sang before Saul. And  David's music cheered Saul's heart, and drove away his sad feelings.    Saul liked David so well that he made him his armorbearer; and David  carried the shield and spear, and sword for Saul, when the king was  before his army. But Saul did not know that David had been anointed by  Samuel.    After a time, Saul seemed well; and David returned to Bethlehem and was  once more among his sheep in the field. Perhaps it was at this time that  David sang his shepherd song, or it may have been long afterward, when  David looked back in thought to those days when he was leading his  sheep. This is the song, which you have heard often:    \"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;  He leadeth me beside the still waters,  He restoreth my soul;  He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil; for thou art with me;  Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies;  Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\"        THE STORY OF THE FIGHT WITH THE GIANT    All through the reign of Saul, there was constant war with the  Philistines, who lived upon the lowlands west of Israel. At one time,  when David was still with his sheep, a few years after he had been  anointed by Samuel, the camps of the Philistines and the Israelites were  set against each other on opposite sides of the valley of Elah. In the  army of Israel were the three oldest brothers of David.    Every day a giant came out of the camp of the Philistines, and dared  some one to come from the Israelites' camp and fight with him. The  giant's name was Goliath. He was nine feet high; and he wore armor from  head to foot, and carried a spear twice as long and as heavy as any  other man could hold; and his shield bearer walked before him. He came  every day and called out across the little valley:    \"I am a Philistine, and you are servants of Saul. Now choose one of your  men, and let him come out and fight with me. If I kill him; then you  shall submit to us; and if he kills me, then we will give up to you.  Come, now, send out your man!\"    But no man in the army, not even King Saul, dared to go out and fight  with the giant. Forty days the camps stood against each other, and the  Philistine giant continued his call.    One day, old Jesse, the father of David, sent David from Bethlehem to  visit his three brothers in the army. David came, and spoke to his  brothers; and while he was talking with them, Goliath the giant came out  as before in front of the camp calling for some one to fight with him.    They said one to another:    \"If any man will go out and kill this Philistine, the king will give him  a great reward and a high rank; and the king's daughter shall be his  wife.\"    And David said:    \"Who is this man that speaks in this proud manner against the armies of  the living God? Why does not some one go out and kill him?\"    David's brother Eliab said to him:    \"What are you doing here, leaving your sheep in the field? I know that  you have come down just to see the battle.\"    But David did not care for his brother's words. He thought he saw a way  to kill this boasting giant; and he said:    \"If no one else will go, I will go out and fight with this enemy of the  Lord's people.\"    They brought David before King Saul. Some years had passed since Saul  had met David, and he had grown from a boy to a man, so that Saul did  not know him as the shepherd who had played on the harp before him in  other days.    Saul said to David:    \"You cannot fight with this great giant. You are very young; and he is a  man of war, trained from his youth.\"    And"]]]
