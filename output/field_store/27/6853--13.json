Even without supposing any such convulsion to the empire as  a loss of the Bosphorus, his reign will hardly be a long one. The Ulema  of Constantinople are by no means all on his side, and the party of  \"Young Turkey,\" cowed for the moment by the terrorism which there  prevails, is his bitter enemy, and will not let him rest. It will  infallibly on the next danger from Europe, show its head again and take  its revenge.    It is said to be the programme of this party, when it next comes to  power, to separate the spiritual functions of the Caliphate from those  of the head of the State, copying, in so far, the modern practice of  Europe towards the Papacy. I suppose that it would be attempted to  restore that state of things, which as we have already seen, existed at  Cairo in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; and it is just  conceivable that, as far as Turkey itself was concerned, such an  arrangement might, for a time, succeed. There would then be two powers  at Constantinople, a Maire du Palais who would reign, and a Caliph who  would be head of religion;--a separation of offices which would  certainly facilitate the sort of reform that Midhat and his friends  desire. But to the world at large the event would only signify that  Constantinople had formally abdicated her claim to leadership, and Islam  would never acknowledge as Caliph the mere puppet of an irreligious  clique of officials, because he happened to be a member of the Beni  Othman. His political power is the only thing that reconciles Islam with  an Ottoman Caliph, and without sovereignty he would be discarded. In  whatever way, therefore, that we look at it, there seems justification  in probability for the conviction already cited that after Abd el Hamid  a new order of Caliphal succession will be seen.    It seems to be an universal opinion at the present day among those who  think at all upon the matter, that whatever change may be impending for  Islam, it will be in the direction of concentration rather than of  extension. All parties see that the day of outside conquest is at an  end, and that the utmost that Islam can look forward to politically is  the maintenance of its present positions, and as an extreme possibility  the emancipation of its lost provinces in India and North Africa from  Christian rule. There is, therefore, a conviction that the removal of  the seat of supreme authority, when made, will be towards the centre,  not to any new extremity of Islam. Constantinople, even if all Islam  were combined for its defence, is felt to be too near the infidel  frontier to be safe, and cosmopolitan city as it has become, it is by  many looked upon itself as infidel. A position further removed from  danger and more purely Mohammedan is the necessity of the day; and it  can hardly be doubted that, when the time comes, the possession of some  such vantage ground will be recognized as a first qualification with  whoever shall assume the leadership of Islam.    We have seen that Abd el Hamid dreams of Damascus or Bagdad. But others  dream of Cairo as the new seat of the Caliphate; and to the majority of  far-sighted Mussulmans it is rapidly becoming apparent that the retreat,  once begun, must be conducted further still, and that the only true  resting-place for theocracy is in Arabia, its birthplace and the  fountain head of its inspiration. There, alone in the world, all the  conditions for the independent exercise of religious sovereignty are to  be found. In Arabia there are neither Christians nor Jews nor infidels  of any sort for Islam to count with, nor is it so rich a possession that  it should ever excite the cupidity of the Western Powers. A Caliph there  need fear no admonition from Frank ambassadors in virtue of any  capitulations; he would be free to act as the Successor of the Apostle  should, and would breathe the pure air of an unadulterated Islam. A  return, therefore, to Medina or Mecca is the probable future of the  Caliphate.    The importance of Arabia has of late years been fully recognized both at  Constantinople and elsewhere. It has been the sustained policy of Abd  el Hamid at all cost and by whatsoever means to maintain his influence  there; and he knows that without it his spiritual pretensions could have  no secure foundations. Arabia, he perceives, is the main point of the  Caliphal problem; and whether or not the future holder of the office  reside in Hejaz, it is certain that by its tenure alone the Mohammedan  world will judge of his right to be their leader. It will, therefore,  before we go further, be interesting to examine the relations existing  in the past and present between Mecca and the Caliphate, and to  ascertain the position now held by Abd el Hamid in Arabia. On this point  I believe that I can offer information which will be both valuable and  new.    The political constitution of the Moslem Holy Land is one of the most  anomalous in the world. Like every district of Arabia proper, Hejaz has  a town and a nomad population, but almost no intermediate agricultural  class. The townsmen I have already described--a multitude of mixed  origin, descended from such pilgrims as from every quarter of the globe  have visited the Holy Places, and have remained to marry and die in  them. The Nomads, on the contrary, are a pure race of a peculiarly noble  type, and unchanged in any essential feature of their life from what  they were in the days of Mohammed. They are warlike, unquiet, Bedouins,  camel-riders (for they have no horses), and armed with matchlocks; and  they are proud of their independence, and tenacious of their rights. No  serious attempt has ever been made, except by Mehemet Ali, to subdue  them, and none at all has succeeded. Unlike the generality of Peninsular  Bedouins, however, they are professed Sunite Mohammedans, if not of a  very pious type; and they acknowledge as their chief the head of their  most noble tribe, the Grand Sherif of the Koreysh, who is also Prince of  Mecca.    The Koreysh is still a distinct nomadic tribe, inhabiting the immediate  neighbourhood of Mecca; not numerous, but not in decay. They are divided  into several sections, each governed by its Sheykh, the chief of which,  the Abadleh, has for several centuries supplied the reigning family of  Hejaz. This last traces its descent from Ali ibn Abutaleb, the fourth  Caliph, through his son Hassan, and through Ali's wife, Fatmeh, from  Mohammed himself. It is probably the oldest authentic male descent in  the world, and certainly the most sacred. All the members of this  Abadleh family enjoy the title of Sherif, the head of it only being  distinguished as the Sherif el Kebir, the Great or Grand Sherif. The  rest of the Koreysh, not being descended from Fatmeh, do not receive the  title. All alike wear the Bedouin dress of abba and kefiyeh, even the  Prince himself, standing in this strikingly in contrast with the Hejazi  citizens, who affect the turban and gombaz.    The district of Medina is occupied by the Harb Bedouins, a larger and  more powerful tribe than the Koreysh, who also recognize the Sherif, but  their allegiance is precarious; while to the east and south of Mecca the  Ateybeh and Assir, more powerful still, are wholly independent. It has  always been a difficult matter to keep these unruly elements at peace  with each other and with the citizens, nor could the Sherif hope to  effect it were he not himself of Bedouin and noble blood.    The early history of the Sherifate is exceedingly obscure. When the  Caliphs definitely abandoned Medina as their capital in the fortieth  year of Islam (A.D. 662), they for a time left deputies of the Sherifal  family behind them to govern in their name, and, as long as the Ommiad  and Abbaside dynasties continued at Damascus and Bagdad, their  sovereignty was acknowledged in Hejaz. But on the destruction of the  Arabian Caliphate in 1259, the Sherifal family seems to have set itself  up independently, relying only on the casual help of the Egyptian  Sultans and the Imams of Sana to protect them against the Bedouins of  Nejd and Assir, now hardly any longer, even in name, Mohammedans. The  Egyptian Sultan, however, was the titular protector of the Holy Places,  and it was he who transmitted the Surrah, or religious contributions  made by the Faithful, and provided escort for the yearly pilgrimage made  to the shrines. Thus we read of Kaid Beg having rebuilt the Mosque of  Medina in 1476, and having sent a yearly subsidy of 7500 ardebs of corn  for the townspeople. Other princes, however, contributed their offerings  too, and received titles of honour connected with the Holy Land, the  Shahs of Persia, the Moguls, and the Ottomans. The first connection of  the latter with Mecca that I can find was in 1413, when the Padishah  Mohammed Khan I., having sent a surrah, or bag of gold, to the Sherif to  be distributed in alms, received from him the title of Khaddam el  Harameyn, servant of the two shrines; and the gift being continued  annually by the Ottoman Padishahs may very likely have paved the way to  their recognition later as Caliphs.    It would seem singular at first sight that the Sherifs, being  themselves of the sacred family whose special inheritance the Caliphate  was, should ever thus have recognized a stranger as its legal heir. But  the political weakness of the Meccan Government in the sixteenth century  must be taken into account as the all-sufficient reason. The Grand  Sherif could hardly have stood alone as an independent sovereign, for he  was continually menaced on the one side by the dissenting Omani, and on  the other by the unbelieving tribes of Nejd, against whom his frontier  was defenceless. He could not, with his own resources, protect the  pilgrim routes from plunder--and on the pilgrimage all the prosperity of  Hejaz depended. It therefore was a necessity with the Meccans to have a  protector of some sort; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1722"],[0,"Martin Luther's Large Catechism, translated (#14)"],[1,"hand, prevent whatever may  be discreditable to him. And it is especially an excellent and noble  virtue for one always to explain advantageously and put the best  construction upon all he may hear of his neighbor (if it be not  notoriously evil), or at any rate to condone it over and against the  poisonous tongues that are busy wherever they can pry out and discover  something to blame in a neighbor, and that explain and pervert it in  the worst way; as is done now especially with the precious Word of God  and its preachers.    There are comprehended therefore in this commandment quite a multitude  of good works which please God most highly, and bring abundant good and  blessing, if only the blind world and the false saints would recognize  them. For there is nothing on or in entire man which can do both  greater and more extensive good or harm in spiritual and in temporal  matters than the tongue, though it is the least and feeblest member.    The Ninth and Tenth Commandments    Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house. Thou shalt not covet thy  neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his  cattle, nor anything that is his.    These two commandments are given quite exclusively to the Jews;  nevertheless, in part they also concern us. For they do not interpret  them as referring to unchastity or theft, because these are  sufficiently forbidden above. They also thought that they had kept all  those when they had done or not done the external act. Therefore God  has added these two commandments in order that it be esteemed as sin  and forbidden to desire or in any way to aim at getting our neighbor's  wife or possessions; and especially because under the Jewish government  man-servants and maid-servants were not free as now to serve for wages  as long as they pleased, but were their master's property with their  body and all they had, as cattle and other possessions. Moreover,  every man had power over his wife to put her away publicly by giving  her a bill of divorce, and to take another. Therefore they were in  constant danger among each other that if one took a fancy to another's  wife, he might allege any reason both to dismiss his own wife and to  estrange the other's wife from him, that he might obtain her under  pretext of right. That was not considered a sin nor disgrace with them;  as little as now with hired help, when a proprietor dismisses his  man-servant or maid-servant, or takes another's servants from him in  any way.    Therefore (I say) they thus interpreted these commandments, and that  rightly (although their scope reaches somewhat farther and higher),  that no one think or purpose to obtain what belongs to another, such as  his wife, servants, house and estate, land meadows, cattle, even with a  show of right or by a subterfuge, yet with injury to his neighbor. For  above, in the Seventh Commandment, the vice is forbidden where one  wrests to himself the possessions of others, or withholds them from his  neighbor, which he cannot do by right. But here it is also forbidden to  alienate anything from your neighbor, even though you could do so with  honor in the eyes of the world, so that no one could accuse or blame  you as though you had obtained it wrongfully.    For we are so inclined by nature that no one desires to see another  have as much as himself, and each one acquires as much as he can; the  other may fare as best he can. And yet we pretend to be godly, know how  to adorn ourselves most finely and conceal our rascality, resort to and  invent adroit devices and deceitful artifices (such as now are daily  most ingeniously contrived) as though they were derived from the law  codes; yea, we even dare impertinently to refer to it, and boast of it,  and will not have it called rascality, but shrewdness and caution. In  this lawyers and jurists assist, who twist and stretch the law to suit  it to their cause, stress words and use them for a subterfuge,  irrespective of equity or their neighbor's necessity. And, in short,  whoever is the most expert and cunning in these affairs finds most help  in law, as they themselves say: Vigilantibus iura subveniunt [that is,  The laws favor the watchful].    This last commandment therefore is given not for rogues in the eyes of  the world, but just for the most pious, who wish to be praised and be  called honest and upright people, since they have not offended against  the former commandments, as especially the Jews claimed to be, and even  now many great noblemen, gentlemen, and princes. For the other common  masses belong yet farther down, under the Seventh Commandment, as those  who are not much concerned whether they acquire their possessions with  honor and right.    Now, this occurs most frequently in cases that are brought into court,  where it is the purpose to get something from our neighbor and to force  him out of his own. As (to give examples), when people quarrel and  wrangle about a large inheritance, real estate, etc., they avail  themselves of, and resort to, whatever has the appearance of right, so  dressing and adorning everything that the law must favor their side,  and they keep the property with such title that no one can make  complaint or lay claim thereto. In like manner, if any one desire to  have a castle, city, duchy, or any other great thing, he practices so  much financiering through relationships, and by any means he can, that  the other is judicially deprived of it, and it is adjudicated to him,  and confirmed with deed and seal and declared to have been acquired by  princely title and honestly.    Likewise also in common trade where one dexterously slips something out  of another's hand, so that he must look after it, or surprises and  defrauds him in a matter in which he sees advantage and benefit for  himself, so that the latter, perhaps on account of distress or debt,  cannot regain or redeem it without injury, and the former gains the  half or even more; and yet this must not be considered as acquired by  fraud or stolen, but honestly bought. Here they say: First come, first  served, and every one must look to his own interest, let another get  what he can. And who can be so smart as to think of all the ways in  which one can get many things into his possession by such specious  pretexts? This the world does not consider wrong [nor is it punished by  laws], and will not see that the neighbor is thereby placed at a  disadvantage, and must sacrifice what he cannot spare without injury.  Yet there is no one who wishes this to be done to him; from which we  can easily perceive that such devices and pretexts are false.    Thus it was done formerly also with respect to wives: they knew such  devices that if one were pleased with another woman, he personally or  through others (as there were many ways and means to be invented)  caused her husband to conceive a displeasure toward her, or had her  resist him and so conduct herself that he was obliged to dismiss her  and leave her to the other. That sort of thing undoubtedly prevailed  much under the Law, as also we read in the (Gospel of King Herod that  he took his brother's wife while he was yet living, and yet wished to  be thought an honorable, pious man, as St. Mark also testifies of him.  But such an example, I trust, will not occur among us, because in the  New Testament those who are married are forbidden to be divorced,  except in such a case where one [shrewdly] by some stratagem takes away  a rich bride from another. But it is not a rare thing with us that one  estranges or alienates another's man-servant or maid-servant, or  entices them away by flattering words.    In whatever way such things happen, we must know that God does not wish  that you deprive your neighbor of anything that belongs to him so that  he suffer the loss and you gratify your avarice with it, even if you  could keep it honorably before the world; for it is a secret and  insidious imposition practiced under the hat, as we say, that it may  not be observed. For although you go your way as if you had done no one  any wrong, you have nevertheless injured your neighbor; and if it is  not called stealing and cheating, yet it is called coveting your  neighbor's property, that is, aiming at possession of it, enticing it  away from him without his will, and being unwilling to see him enjoy  what God has granted him. And although the judge and every one must  leave you in possession of it, yet God will not leave you therein; for  He sees the deceitful heart and the malice of the world, which is sure  to take an ell in addition wherever you yield to her a finger's  breadth, and at length public wrong and violence follow.    Therefore we allow these commandments to remain in their ordinary  meaning, that it is commanded, first, that we do not desire our  neighbor's damage, nor even assist, nor give occasion for it, but  gladly wish and leave him what he has, and, besides, advance and  preserve for him what may be for his profit and service, as we should  wish to be treated. Thus these commandments are especially directed  against envy and miserable avarice, God wishing to remove all causes  and sources whence arises everything by which we do injury to our  neighbor, and therefore He expresses it in plain words: Thou shalt not  covet, etc. For He would especially have the heart pure, although we  shall never attain to that as long as we live here; so that this  commandment will remain, like all the rest, one that will constantly  accuse us and show how godly we are in the sight of God!     Conclusion of the Ten Commandments.    Thus we have the Ten Commandments, a compend of divine doctrine, as to  what we are to do in order that our whole life may be pleasing to God,  and the true fountain and channel from and in which everything must  arise and flow that is to be a good work, so that outside of the Ten  Commandments no work or thing can be good or pleasing to God, however "]]]
