Antwerp has a grill-room that can be highly recommended in  the Criterium, situated on the Avenue de Keyser, near the Central  Railway Station. The Criterium is also known as Keller's, and has a  large English _clientele_. Besides chops and steaks from the grill,  there are other viands, and a _table-d'hote_ dinner is supplied in the  middle of the day at 2 francs 50 centimes. The food is of the best,  while a special feature is made of English beers and other drinks  usually sought after by the Briton travelling abroad. The restaurant at  the Zoological Gardens is well managed and much frequented.      Spa    \"Les jeux sont faits! Rien ne va plus.\" It is not the cry of the  croupier, it is the proclamation of Parliament. What will happen now  that the Cercle des Etrangers at Spa has been closed, in consequence of  the Belgian Anti-gambling Bill which came into operation on the 1st  January 1903, it is difficult to say; one thing is certain, the hotels  and restaurants will suffer, for more people came to the pretty little  town on the outskirts of the Ardennes to try their luck at _roulette_ or  _trente et quarante_ than to drink the iron waters at the Pouhon and  other springs, or to take the effervescing baths and douches. Once upon  a time, Spa was one of the most fashionable and most frequented  watering-places in Europe, but gradually its glories have departed,  although its natural beauties remain. Of the Spa restaurants as they  exist to-day, there is little to be said and less to be praised. To tell  the truth, there is not a really first-class restaurant in the place. To  nearly all the springs, which are located in easy proximity to the town,  so-called restaurants are attached, but the patronage being intermittent  and uncertain, the choice of _plats_ is limited, and the service is slow  and bad. The Sauveniere Spring is nearest to the town, but the drive  there is all up-hill, monotonous, and dusty. The Geronstere is more  prettily situated, and is a favourite resort for luncheon during the  summer season; but unless the meal is specially ordered beforehand, the  visitor will, as a rule, have to be content with eggs, beef-steaks, or  cutlets. The Tonnelet is situated on the roadside, and the restaurant  there is often uncomfortable and dusty. Those who make the Tours des  Fontaines will be best advised to stop for lunch at the Source de  Barisart, which is situated in a most picturesque part of the woods, 160  feet above the town, from which it is distant about a mile. The  much-written-of Promenade de Meyerbeer is close at hand, and a stroll  beneath the trees before or after lunch will be enjoyed, for the  surroundings are charming and romantic. If previous notice for a meal  can be given, so much the better: there is probably a telephone from the  town. In trout time this fish should be included, as it is caught  plentifully in the district, and is, as a rule, fresh and good. As  before said, there is no good restaurant in the town,--excepting, of  course, those in connection with the principal hotels, where a  _table-d'hote_ is usually served at mid-day and in the evening. The Cafe  Restaurant attached to the Casino is convenient, and will be found more  than sufficient now that the gaming rooms have been suppressed. On the  other side of the Casino is the Hotel d'Orange, well appointed and with  a beautiful garden, and M. Goldschmidt, the proprietor, looks well after  his guests. His dining-room has all the character of a restaurant, being  open to the outside public. The company there is as a rule  gay--sometimes, it is said, even a little too gay, but everything is of  the best and well served. Probably, however, the gourmet will find  things more to his taste at the Grand Hotel de l'Europe, where M.  Henrard Richard always paid great attention to his cuisine. Although he  no longer personally controls the management of L'Europe, the hotel is  still under the direction of his family, and retains its high  reputation. The following is a menu of a 6-franc _table-d'hote_ dinner  served in September. It has not been specially selected, and is  therefore a fair specimen:--             Bisque d'Ecrevisses.          Brunoise a la Royale.            Truites Meuniere.      Filet de Boeuf garni Beaulieu.          Ris de veau Princesse.       Petits pois a la Francaise.       Perdreaux rotis sur Canapes.              Glace Vanille.               Gaufrettes.           Corbeille de Fruits.    The wines here are good, the Moselle and Rhine wines being especially  cheap. Other hotels with restaurants attached that may be mentioned are  the Britannique (with a fine garden in which meals are served), the  Bellevue, the Flandre, and the Rosette. The last mentioned is a small  hotel attached to the Palace of the late Queen of the Belgians, and is  run by Her Majesty's _chef_. The meals for the Palace were always cooked  at the hotel, and the restaurant, though simply appointed, has latterly  been excellent in its way. Strangers feeding there should try and secure  a table on the little glass-covered terrace in front of the hotel.  Mention might also be made of a couple of small restaurants that have in  the past been supported by the professional players at the tables. One  in a side street near the Casino, kept by a Frenchman, has a reputation  for its cheap French wines; and the Macon, at a franc the bottle, is  indeed drinkable. At the other, the Limbourg, the cooking is German in  character and flavour. Both places may be recommended as wholesome and  honest to people who want to \"get through\" on about 10 francs a day.  There is no more to be said.      Bruges    It always seems to me that Bruges is the quietest city in the world. At  least when one sits out in the garden of the Hotel de Flandre, after  sampling some of the excellent old Burgundy which reposes in its  cellars, and listens to the chimes from the brown belfry, a feeling of  perfect peace steals over one. There are few hotels in Belgium, if any,  which have such a fine selection of Burgundy as the Flandre has, and the  food, if not noticeably good, is at all events not noticeably bad. Otto,  who used to be the head waiter at the Hotel de Flandre, is now the  proprietor of the Hotel de Londres in the station square; and though the  appearance of the hotel is not inviting, he can cook a _sole au gratin_  as well as any cook in Belgium. The _table-d'hote_ lunch at the Panier  d'Or, in the chief square, is very excellent for the money.      Ostend    I do not think that there is much to be said in favour of the  restaurants of the big hotels at Ostend. One gets an imitation of a  Parisian meal at half again the Paris price. I have little doubt that  the cessation of gambling will bring all the prices down at the hotels,  but during past years gamblers' prices have been asked and paid. At the  Continental there is a 10-franc _table-d'hote_ dinner, much patronised,  because people know exactly what it will cost them; and at the Palace  Hotel there is a _table-d'hote_ room where the food served is well  cooked; but it lacks the life and bustle of the restaurant, and most  people who go there for a meal or two revert to the restaurant with its  _a la carte_ breakfasts and dinner. There is a Chateau Laroque in the  cellars of the Palace at 7 francs a bottle which is quite excellent.  There is a little restaurant, called the Taverne St-Jean, in a side  street, the Rampe de Flandre, kept by an ex-head waiter from the  Restaurant Re at Monte Carlo, at which the cookery is thoroughly  bourgeois, but good of its kind and the prices low; and there is on the  quay a house, kept by a fisherman who is the owner of several smacks,  where the explorer who does not mind surroundings redolent of the sea  can get a good fried sole, and a more than fair bottle of white wine.    Any one who wishes to see what a Belgian meal can be in the number of  courses should go by train past Blankenberghe, which is a pale  reflection of Ostend, to Heyste, and partake of a mid-day dinner there  at one of the hotels patronised by the Brussels tradesmen and their  families, who come to the little sea-town for change of air. Fifteen or  sixteen plates piled in front, or at the side of each place, mark the  number of courses to be gone through, and most of the guests eat the  meal through from soup to fruit without shirking a single course.          CHAPTER IV    BRUSSELS         The Savoy--The Epaule de Mouton--The Faille Dechiree--The Lion       d'Or--The Regina--The Helder--The Filet de       Sole--Wiltcher's--Justine's--The Etoile--The Belveder--The Cafe       Riche--Duranton's--The Laiterie--Miscellaneous.      Brussels must have been a gayer city than the Brussels of to-day when it  earned the title of \"a little Paris.\" There is at the present time very  little indeed of Paris about the Belgian capital, and, in the matter of  restaurants, there is a marked contrast between the two cities. Here the  latter-day Lucullus will have to seek in queer nooks and out-of-the-way  corners to discover the best kitchens and the cellars where the wines  are of the finest _crus_. The aristocracy of Belgium mostly dines _en  famille_ and the restaurants that cater for the middle classes are the  most patronised. There are, however, several establishments which  provide for more refined tastes, but they will not be found upon the big  boulevards or the main thoroughfares. Four of the best restaurants in  Brussels are in two narrow little streets, and their exteriors resemble  old-fashioned London coffee-houses, rather than resorts of fashion.  Brussels is particularly destitute of smart rooms where one can sup in  gay company \"after the opera is over.\" Until the Savoy was opened, we  had, in fact, nothing beyond the ordinary restaurant with its little  _cabinets particuliers_. When Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#14)"],[1,"inquired.    \"Look,\" said my uncle.    I looked down upon the plain below, and I saw a vast, a prodigious  volume of pulverized pumice stone, of sand, of dust, rising to the  heavens in the form of a mighty waterspout. It resembled the fearful  phenomenon of a similar character known to the travelers in the desert  of the great Sahara.    The wind was driving it directly towards that side of Sneffels on which  we were perched. This opaque veil standing up between us and the sun  projected a deep shadow on the flanks of the mountain. If this sand  spout broke over us, we must all be infallibly destroyed, crushed in its  fearful embraces. This extraordinary phenomenon, very common when the  wind shakes the glaciers, and sweeps over the arid plains, is in the  Icelandic tongue called \"mistour.\"    \"Hastigt, hastigt!\" cried our guide.    Now I certainly knew nothing of Danish, but I thoroughly understood that  his gestures were meant to quicken us.    The guide turned rapidly in a direction which would take us to the back  of the crater, all the while ascending slightly.    We followed rapidly, despite our excessive fatigue.    A quarter of an hour later Hans paused to enable us to look back. The  mighty whirlwind of sand was spreading up the slope of the mountain to  the very spot where we had proposed to halt. Huge stones were caught up,  cast into the air, and thrown about as during an eruption. We were  happily a little out of the direction of the wind, and therefore out of  reach of danger. But for the precaution and knowledge of our guide, our  dislocated bodies, our crushed and broken limbs, would have been cast to  the wind, like dust from some unknown meteor.    Hans, however, did not think it prudent to pass the night on the bare  side of the cone. We therefore continued our journey in a zigzag  direction. The fifteen hundred feet which remained to be accomplished  took us at least five hours. The turnings and windings, the  no-thoroughfares, the marches and marches, turned that insignificant  distance into at least three leagues. I never felt such misery, fatigue  and exhaustion in my life. I was ready to faint from hunger and cold.  The rarefied air at the same time painfully acted upon my lungs.    At last, when I thought myself at my last gasp, about eleven at night,  it being in that region quite dark, we reached the summit of Mount  Sneffels! It was in an awful mood of mind, that despite my fatigue,  before I descended into the crater which was to shelter us for the  night, I paused to behold the sun rise at midnight on the very day of  its lowest declension, and enjoyed the spectacle of its ghastly pale  rays cast upon the isle which lay sleeping at our feet!    I no longer wondered at people traveling all the way from England to  Norway to behold this magical and wondrous spectacle.          CHAPTER 13    THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS      Our supper was eaten with ease and rapidity, after which everybody did  the best he could for himself within the hollow of the crater. The bed  was hard, the shelter unsatisfactory, the situation painful--lying in  the open air, five thousand feet above the level of the sea!    Nevertheless, it has seldom happened to me to sleep so well as I did on  that particular night. I did not even dream. So much for the effects of  what my uncle called \"wholesome fatigue.\"    Next day, when we awoke under the rays of a bright and glorious sun, we  were nearly frozen by the keen air. I left my granite couch and made one  of the party to enjoy a view of the magnificent spectacle which  developed itself, panorama-like, at our feet.    I stood upon the lofty summit of Mount Sneffels' southern peak. Thence I  was able to obtain a view of the greater part of the island. The optical  delusion, common to all lofty heights, raised the shores of the island,  while the central portions appeared depressed. It was by no means too  great a flight of fancy to believe that a giant picture was stretched  out before me. I could see the deep valleys that crossed each other in  every direction. I could see precipices looking like sides of wells,  lakes that seemed to be changed into ponds, ponds that looked like  puddles, and rivers that were transformed into petty brooks. To my right  were glaciers upon glaciers, and multiplied peaks, topped with light  clouds of smoke.    The undulation of these infinite numbers of mountains, whose snowy  summits make them look as if covered by foam, recalled to my remembrance  the surface of a storm-beaten ocean. If I looked towards the west, the  ocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur, a continuation as it  were, of these fleecy hilltops.    Where the earth ended and the sea began it was impossible for the eye to  distinguish.    I soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in  the mind when looking down from lofty hilltops, and now I was able to do  so without any feeling of nervousness, having fortunately hardened  myself to that kind of sublime contemplation.    I wholly forgot who I was, and where I was. I became intoxicated with a  sense of lofty sublimity, without thought of the abysses into which my  daring was soon about to plunge me. I was presently, however, brought  back to the realities of life by the arrival of the Professor and Hans,  who joined me upon the lofty summit of the peak.    My uncle, turning in a westerly direction, pointed out to me a light  cloud of vapor, a kind of haze, with a faint outline of land rising out  of the waters.    \"Greenland!\" said he.    \"Greenland?\" cried I in reply.    \"Yes,\" continued my uncle, who always when explaining anything spoke as  if he were in a professor's chair; \"we are not more than thirty-five  leagues distant from that wonderful land. When the great annual breakup  of the ice takes place, white bears come over to Iceland, carried by the  floating masses of ice from the north. This, however, is a matter of  little consequence. We are now on the summit of the great, the  transcendent Sneffels, and here are its two peaks, north and south. Hans  will tell you the name by which the people of Iceland call that on which  we stand.\"    My uncle turned to the imperturbable guide, who nodded, and spoke as  usual--one word.    \"Scartaris.\"    My uncle looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance.    \"A crater,\" he said, \"you hear?\"    I did hear, but I was totally unable to make reply.    The crater of Mount Sneffels represented an inverted cone, the gaping  orifice apparently half a mile across; the depth indefinite feet.  Conceive what this hole must have been like when full of flame and  thunder and lightning. The bottom of the funnel-shaped hollow was about  five hundred feet in circumference, by which it will be seen that the  slope from the summit to the bottom was very gradual, and we were  therefore clearly able to get there without much fatigue or difficulty.  Involuntarily, I compared this crater to an enormous loaded cannon; and  the comparison completely terrified me.    \"To descend into the interior of a cannon,\" I thought to myself, \"when  perhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of  a madman.\"    But there was no longer any opportunity for me to hesitate. Hans, with a  perfectly calm and indifferent air, took his usual post at the head of  the adventurous little band. I followed without uttering a syllable.    I felt like the lamb led to the slaughter.    In order to render the descent less difficult, Hans took his way down  the interior of the cone in rather a zigzag fashion, making, as the  sailors say, long tracks to the eastward, followed by equally long ones  to the west. It was necessary to walk through the midst of eruptive  rocks, some of which, shaken in their balance, went rolling down with  thundering clamor to the bottom of the abyss. These continual falls  awoke echoes of singular power and effect.    Many portions of the cone consisted of inferior glaciers. Hans, whenever  he met with one of these obstacles, advanced with a great show of  precaution, sounding the soil with his long iron pole in order to  discover fissures and layers of deep soft snow. In many doubtful or  dangerous places, it became necessary for us to be tied together by a  long rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to  slip, he would be supported by his companions. This connecting link was  doubtless a prudent precaution, but not by any means unattended with  danger.    Nevertheless, and despite all the manifold difficulties of the descent,  along slopes with which our guide was wholly unacquainted, we made  considerable progress without accident. One of our great parcels of rope  slipped from one of the Iceland porters, and rushed by a short cut to  the bottom of the abyss.    By midday we were at the end of our journey. I looked upwards, and saw  only the upper orifice of the cone, which served as a circular frame to  a very small portion of the sky--a portion which seemed to me singularly  beautiful. Should I ever again gaze on that lovely sunlit sky!    The only exception to this extraordinary landscape, was the Peak of  Scartaris, which seemed lost in the great void of the heavens.    The bottom of the crater was composed of three separate shafts, through  which, during periods of eruption, when Sneffels was in action, the  great central furnace sent forth its burning lava and poisonous vapors.  Each of these chimneys or shafts gaped open-mouthed in our path. I kept  as far away from them as possible, not even venturing to take the  faintest peep downwards.    As for the Professor, after a rapid examination of their disposition and  characteristics, he became breathless and panting. He ran from one to  the other like a delighted schoolboy, gesticulating wildly, and uttering  incomprehensible and disjointed phrases in all sorts of languages.    Hans, the guide, and his humbler companions seated themselves on some"]]]
