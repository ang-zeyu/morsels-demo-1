[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17188"],[0,"Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts (#14)"],[1,"  The sea near their town was shallow, so that large ships could not  approach very near, and thus the villagers were kept busy carrying goods  and supplies in small boats, backwards and forwards from the town to the  vessels at anchor. Here was a nice little prize that could not get away  from him, and L'Olonnois had plenty of time to make his preparations to  seize it. As he could not sail a ship directly up to the town, he  cruised about the coast at some distance from de los Cayos, endeavoring  to procure two small boats in which to approach the town, but although  his preparations were made as quietly as possible, the presence of his  vessel was discovered by some fishermen. They knew that it was a pirate  ship, and some of them who had seen L'Olonnois recognized that dreaded  pirate upon the deck. Word of the impending danger was taken to the  town, and the people there immediately sent a message by land to Havana,  informing the Governor of the island that the cruel pirate L'Olonnois  was in a ship a short distance from their village, which he undoubtedly  intended to attack.    When the Governor heard this astonishing tale, it was almost impossible  for him to believe it. The good news of the death of L'Olonnois had come  from Campeachy to Havana, and the people of the latter town also  rejoiced greatly. To be now told that this scourge of the West Indies  was alive, and was about to fall upon a peaceful little village on the  island over which he ruled, filled the Governor with rage as well as  amazement, and he ordered a well-armed ship, with a large crew of  fighting men, to sail immediately for de los Cayos, giving the captain  express orders that he was not to come back until he had obliterated  from the face of the earth the whole of the wretched gang with the  exception of the leader. This extraordinary villain was to be brought to  Havana to be treated as the Governor should see fit. In order that his  commands should be executed promptly and effectually, the Governor sent  a big negro slave in the ship, who was charged with the duty of hanging  every one of the pirates except L'Olonnois.    By the time the war-vessel had arrived at de los Cayos, L'Olonnois had  made his preparation to attack the place. He had procured two large  canoes, and in these he had intended to row up to the town and land with  his men. But now there was a change in the state of affairs, and he was  obliged to alter his plans. The ordinary person in command of two small  boats, who should suddenly discover that a village which he supposed  almost defenceless, was protected by a large man-of-war, with cannon and  a well-armed crew, would have altered his plans so completely that he  would have left that part of the coast of Cuba with all possible  expedition. But the pirates of that day seemed to pay very little  attention to the element of odds; if they met an enemy who was weak,  they would fall upon him, and if they met with one who was a good deal  stronger than themselves, they would fall upon him all the same. When  the time came to fight they fought.    Of course L'Olonnois could not now row leisurely up to the town and  begin to pillage it as he had intended, but no intention of giving up  his project entered his mind. As the Spanish vessel was in his way, he  would attack her and get her out of his way if the thing could be done.    In this new state of affairs he was obliged to use stratagem, and he  also needed a larger force than he had with him, and he therefore  captured some men who were fishing along the coast and put them into his  canoes to help work the oars. Then by night he proceeded slowly in the  direction of the Spanish vessel. The man-of-war was anchored not very  far from the town, and when about two o'clock in the morning the watch  on deck saw some canoes approaching they supposed them to be boats from  shore, for, as has been said, such vessels were continually plying about  those shallow waters. The canoes were hailed, and after having given an  account of themselves they were asked if they knew anything about the  pirate ship upon the coast. L'Olonnois understood very well that it  would not do for him or his men to make answer to these inquiries, for  their speech would have shown they did not belong to those parts.  Therefore he made one of his prisoner fishermen answer that they had not  seen a pirate vessel, and if there had been one there, it must have  sailed away when its captain heard the Spanish ship was coming. Then the  canoes were allowed to go their way, but their way was a very different  one from any which could have been expected by the captain of the ship.    They rowed off into the darkness instead of going toward the town, and  waited until nearly daybreak, then they boldly made for the man-of-war,  one canoe attacking her on one side and the other on the other. Before  the Spanish could comprehend what had happened there were more than  twenty pirates upon their decks, the dreaded L'Olonnois at their head.    In such a case as this cannon were of no use, and when the crew tried to  rush upon deck, they found that cutlasses and pistols did not avail very  much better. The pirates had the advantage; they had overpowered the  watch, and were defending the deck against all comers from below. It  requires a very brave sailor to stick his head out of a hatchway when he  sees three or four cutlasses ready to split it open. But there was some  stout fighting on board; the officers came out of their cabins, and some  of the men were able to force their way out into the struggle. The  pirates knew, however, that they were but few and that were their  enemies allowed to get on deck they would prove entirely too strong, and  they fought, each scoundrel of them, like three men, and the savage  fight ended by every Spanish sailor or officer who was not killed or  wounded being forced to stay below decks, where the hatches were  securely fastened down upon them.    L'Olonnois now stood a proud victor on the deck of his prize, and, being  a man of principle, he determined to live up to the distinguished  reputation which he had acquired in that part of the world. Baring his  muscular and hairy right arm, he clutched the handle of his sharp and  heavy cutlass and ordered the prisoners to be brought up from below, one  at a time, and conducted to the place where he stood. He wished to give  Spain a lesson which would make her understand that he was not to be  interfered with in the execution of his enterprises, and he determined  to allow himself the pleasure of personally teaching this lesson.    As soon as a prisoner was brought to L'Olonnois he struck off his head,  and this performance he continued, beginning with number one, and going  on until he had counted ninety. The last one brought to him was the  negro slave. This man, who was not a soldier, was desperately frightened  and begged piteously for his life. L'Olonnois, finding that the man was  willing to tell everything he knew, questioned him about the sending of  this vessel from Havana, and when the poor fellow had finished by  telling that he had come there, not of his own accord, but simply for  the purpose of obeying his master, to hang all the pirates except their  leader, that great buccaneer laughed, and, finding he could get nothing  more from the negro, cut off his head likewise, and his body was tumbled  into the sea after those of his companions.    Now there was not a Spaniard left on board the great ship except one  man, who had been preserved from the fate of the others because  L'Olonnois had some correspondence to attend to, and he needed a  messenger to carry a letter. The pirate captain went into the cabin,  where he found writing-materials ready to his hand, and there he  composed a letter to the Governor of Havana, a part of which read as  follows: \"I shall never henceforward give quarter unto any Spaniard  whatsoever. And I have great hopes that I shall execute on your own  person the very same punishment I have done to them you sent against me.  Thus I have retaliated the kindness you designed unto me and my  companions.\"    When this message was received by the dignified official who filled the  post of Governor of Cuba, he stormed and fairly foamed at the mouth. To  be utterly foiled and discomfited by this resurrected pirate, and to be  afterwards addressed in terms of such unheard-of insolence and abuse,  was more than he could bear, and, in the presence of many of his  officials and attendants, he swore a terrible oath that after that hour  he would never again give quarter to any buccaneer, no matter when or  where he was captured, or what he might be doing at the time. Every man  of the wretched band should die as soon as he could lay hands upon him.    But when the inhabitants of Havana and the surrounding villages heard of  this terrible resolution of their Governor they were very much  disturbed. They lived in constant danger of attack, especially those who  were engaged in fishing or maritime pursuits, and they feared that when  it became known that no buccaneer was to receive quarter, the Spanish  colonists would be treated in the same way, no matter where they might  be found and taken. Consequently, it was represented to the Governor  that his plan of vengeance would work most disastrously for the Spanish  settlers, for the buccaneers could do far more damage to them than he  could possibly do to these dreadful Brethren of the Coast, and that,  unless he wished to bring upon them troubles greater than those of  famine or pestilence, they begged that he would retract his oath.    When the high dignitary had cooled down a little, he saw that there was  a good deal of sense in what the representative of the people had said  to him, and he consequently felt obliged, in consideration of the public  safety, to take back what he had said, and to give up the purpose, which  would have rendered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#14)"],[1," delayed this attempt just  long enough to save him.  Swept off his feet by the fury of the  assault, he fell sideways against the barrier and had the good fortune  to seize his enemy by the leg.  Muffled in the sacking, it was vain to  cry out; but he held furiously to the limb he had grasped and he and  his attacker rolled together on the footway.  Aubrey was a powerful  man, and even despite the surprise could probably have got the better  of the situation; but as he wrestled desperately and tried to rid  himself of his hood, a crashing blow fell upon his head, half stunning  him.  He lay sprawled out, momentarily incapable of struggle, yet  conscious enough to expect, rather curiously, the dizzying sensation of  a drop through insupportable air into the icy water of the East River.  Hands seized him--and then, passively, he heard a shout, the sound of  footsteps running on the planks, and other footsteps hurrying away at  top speed.  In a moment the sacking was torn from his head and a  friendly pedestrian was kneeling beside him.    \"Say, are you all right?\" said the latter anxiously.  \"Gee, those guys  nearly got you.\"    Aubrey was too faint and dizzy to speak for a moment.  His head was  numb and he felt certain that several inches of it had been caved in.  Putting up his hand, feebly, he was surprised to find the contours of  his skull much the same as usual.  The stranger propped him against his  knee and wiped away a trickle of blood with his handkerchief.    \"Say, old man, I thought you was a goner,\" he said sympathetically.  \"I  seen those fellows jump you.  Too bad they got away.  Dirty work, I'll  say so.\"    Aubrey gulped the night air, and sat up.  The bridge rocked under him;  against the star-speckled sky he could see the Woolworth Building  bending and jazzing like a poplar tree in a gale.  He felt very sick.    \"Ever so much obliged to you,\" he stammered.  \"I'll be all right in a  minute.\"    \"D'you want me to go and ring up a nambulance?\" said his assistant.    \"No, no,\" said Aubrey; \"I'll be all right.\"  He staggered to his feet  and clung to the rail of the bridge, trying to collect his wits.  One  phrase ran over and over in his mind with damnable iteration--\"Mild,  but they satisfy!\"    \"Where were you going?\" said the other, supporting him.    \"Madison Avenue and Thirty-Second----\"    \"Maybe I can flag a jitney for you.  Here,\" he cried, as another  citizen approached afoot, \"Give this fellow a hand.  Someone beat him  over the bean with a club.  I'm going to get him a lift.\"    The newcomer readily undertook the friendly task, and tied Aubrey's  handkerchief round his head, which was bleeding freely.  After a few  moments the first Samaritan succeeded in stopping a touring car which  was speeding over from Brooklyn.  The driver willingly agreed to take  Aubrey home, and the other two helped him in.  Barring a nasty gash on  his scalp he was none the worse.    \"A fellow needs a tin hat if he's going to wander round Long Island at  night,\" said the motorist genially.  \"Two fellows tried to hold me up  coming in from Rockville Centre the other evening.  Maybe they were the  same two that picked on you.  Did you get a look at them?\"    \"No,\" said Aubrey.  \"That piece of sacking might have helped me trace  them, but I forgot it.\"    \"Want to run back for it?\"    \"Never mind,\" said Aubrey.  \"I've got a hunch about this.\"    \"Think you know who it is?  Maybe you're in politics, hey?\"    The car ran swiftly up the dark channel of the Bowery, into Fourth  Avenue, and turned off at Thirty-Second Street to deposit Aubrey in  front of his boarding house.  He thanked his convoy heartily, and  refused further assistance.  After several false shots he got his latch  key in the lock, climbed four creaking flights, and stumbled into his  room.  Groping his way to the wash-basin, he bathed his throbbing head,  tied a towel round it, and fell into bed.        Chapter VI    Titania Learns the Business      Although he kept late hours, Roger Mifflin was a prompt riser.  It is  only the very young who find satisfaction in lying abed in the morning.  Those who approach the term of the fifth decade are sensitively aware  of the fluency of life, and have no taste to squander it among the  blankets.    The bookseller's morning routine was brisk and habitual.  He was  generally awakened about half-past seven by the jangling bell that  balanced on a coiled spring at the foot of the stairs.  This ringing  announced the arrival of Becky, the old scrubwoman who came each  morning to sweep out the shop and clean the floors for the day's  traffic.  Roger, in his old dressing gown of vermilion flannel, would  scuffle down to let her in, picking up the milk bottles and the paper  bag of baker's rolls at the same time.  As Becky propped the front door  wide, opened window transoms, and set about buffeting dust and tobacco  smoke, Roger would take the milk and rolls back to the kitchen and give  Bock a morning greeting.  Bock would emerge from his literary kennel,  and thrust out his forelegs in a genial obeisance.  This was partly  politeness, and partly to straighten out his spine after its all-night  curvature.  Then Roger would let him out into the back yard for a run,  himself standing on the kitchen steps to inhale the bright freshness of  the morning air.    This Saturday morning was clear and crisp.  The plain backs of the  homes along Whittier Street, irregular in profile as the margins of a  free verse poem, offered Roger an agreeable human panorama.  Thin  strands of smoke were rising from chimneys; a belated baker's wagon was  joggling down the alley; in bedroom bay-windows sheets and pillows were  already set to sun and air.  Brooklyn, admirable borough of homes and  hearty breakfasts, attacks the morning hours in cheery, smiling spirit.  Bock sniffed and rooted about the small back yard as though the earth  (every cubic inch of which he already knew by rote) held some new  entrancing flavour.  Roger watched him with the amused and tender  condescension one always feels toward a happy dog--perhaps the same  mood of tolerant paternalism that Gott is said to have felt in watching  his boisterous Hohenzollerns.    The nipping air began to infiltrate his dressing gown, and Roger  returned to the kitchen, his small, lively face alight with zest.  He  opened the draughts in the range, set a kettle on to boil, and went  down to resuscitate the furnace.  As he came upstairs for his bath,  Mrs. Mifflin was descending, fresh and hearty in a starchy morning  apron.  Roger hummed a tune as he picked up the hairpins on the bedroom  floor, and wondered to himself why women are always supposed to be more  tidy than men.    Titania was awake early.  She smiled at the enigmatic portrait of  Samuel Butler, glanced at the row of books over her bed, and dressed  rapidly.  She ran downstairs, eager to begin her experience as a  bookseller.  The first impression the Haunted Bookshop had made on her  was one of superfluous dinginess, and as Mrs. Mifflin refused to let  her help get breakfast--except set out the salt cellars--she ran down  Gissing Street to a little florist's shop she had noticed the previous  afternoon.  Here she spent at least a week's salary in buying  chrysanthemums and a large pot of white heather.  She was distributing  these about the shop when Roger found her.    \"Bless my soul!\" he said.  \"How are you going to live on your wages if  you do that sort of thing?  Pay-day doesn't come until next Friday!\"    \"Just one blow-out,\" she said cheerfully.  \"I thought it would be fun  to brighten the place up a bit.  Think how pleased your floorwalker  will be when he comes in!\"    \"Dear me,\" said Roger.  \"I hope you don't really think we have  floorwalkers in the second-hand book business.\"    After breakfast he set about initiating his new employee into the  routine of the shop.  As he moved about, explaining the arrangement of  his shelves, he kept up a running commentary.    \"Of course all the miscellaneous information that a bookseller has to  have will only come to you gradually,\" he said.  \"Such tags of bookshop  lore as the difference between Philo Gubb and Philip Gibbs, Mrs. Wilson  Woodrow and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, and all that sort of thing.  Don't be  frightened by all the ads you see for a book called \"Bell and Wing,\"  because no one was ever heard to ask for a copy.  That's one of the  reasons why I tell Mr. Gilbert I don't believe in advertising.  Someone  may ask you who wrote The Winning of the Best, and you'll have to know  it wasn't Colonel Roosevelt but Mr. Ralph Waldo Trine.  The beauty of  being a bookseller is that you don't have to be a literary critic:  all  you have to do to books is enjoy them.  A literary critic is the kind  of fellow who will tell you that Wordsworth's Happy Warrior is a poem  of 85 lines composed entirely of two sentences, one of 26 lines and one  of 59.  What does it matter if Wordsworth wrote sentences almost as  long as those of Walt Whitman or Mr. Will H. Hays, if only he wrote a  great poem?  Literary critics are queer birds.  There's Professor  Phelps of Yale, for instance.  He publishes a book in 1918 and calls it  The Advance of English Poetry in the Twentieth Century.  To my way of  thinking a book of that title oughtn't to be published until 2018.  Then somebody will come along and ask you for a book of poems about a  typewriter, and by and by you'll learn that what they want is  Stevenson's Underwoods.  Yes, it's a complicated life.  Never argue  with customers.  Just give them the book they ought to have even if  they don't know they want it.\"    They went outside the front door, and Roger lit his pipe.  In the  little area in front of the shop windows stood large empty boxes  supported on trestles.  \"The first thing I always do----,\" he said.    \"The first thing you'll both do is catch your death of cold,\" said  Helen over his shoulder.  \"Titania, you run"]]]
