He must then be able to shut all  other sounds out of his mind, and bring his drums into a new key while  the orchestra is playing--an extremely nice task.    [Sidenote: _The bass drum._]    The development of modern orchestral music has given dignity also to  the bass drum, which, though definite pitch is denied to it, is now  manipulated in a variety of ways productive of striking effects. Rolls  are played on it with the sticks of the kettle-drums, and it has been  emancipated measurably from the cymbals, which in vulgar brass-band  music are its inseparable companions.    [Sidenote: _The conductor._]    [Sidenote: _Time-beaters and interpreters._]    [Sidenote: _The conductor a necessity._]    In the full sense of the term the orchestral conductor is a product of  the latter half of the present century. Of course, ever since  concerted music began, there has been a musical leader of some kind.  Mural paintings and carvings fashioned in Egypt long before Apollo  sang his magic song and        \"Ilion, like a mist, rose into towers,\"    show the conductor standing before his band beating time by clapping  his hands; and if we are to credit what we have been told about Hebrew  music, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, when they stood before their  multitudinous choirs in the temple at Jerusalem, promoted synchronism  in the performance by stamping upon the floor with lead-shodden feet.  Before the era which developed what I might call \"star\" conductors,  these leaders were but captains of tens and captains of hundreds who  accomplished all that was expected of them if they made the performers  keep musical step together. They were time-beaters merely--human  metronomes. The modern conductor is, in a sense not dreamed of a  century ago, a mediator between the composer and the audience. He is a  virtuoso who plays upon men instead of a key-board, upon a hundred  instruments instead of one. Music differs from her sister arts in many  respects, but in none more than in her dependence on the intermediary  who stands between her and the people for whose sake she exists. It is  this intermediary who wakens her into life.        \"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard      Are sweeter,\"    is a pretty bit of hyperbole which involves a contradiction in terms.  An unheard melody is no melody at all, and as soon as we have music in  which a number of singers or instrumentalists are employed, the taste,  feeling, and judgment of an individual are essential to its  intelligent and effective publication. In the gentle days of the long  ago, when suavity and loveliness of utterance and a recognition of  formal symmetry were the \"be-all and end-all\" of the art, a  time-beater sufficed to this end; but now the contents of music are  greater, the vessel has been wondrously widened, the language is  become curiously complex and ingenious, and no composer of to-day can  write down universally intelligible signs for all that he wishes to  say. Someone must grasp the whole, expound it to the individual  factors which make up the performing sum and provide what is called an  interpretation to the public.    [Sidenote: _\"Star\" conductors._]    That someone, of course, is the conductor, and considering the  progress that music is continually making it is not at all to be  wondered at that he has become a person of stupendous power in the  culture of to-day. The one singularity is that he should be so rare.  This rarity has had its natural consequence, and the conductor who can  conduct, in contradistinction to the conductor who can only beat time,  is now a \"star.\" At present we see him going from place to place in  Europe giving concerts in which he figures as the principal  attraction. The critics discuss his \"readings\" just as they do the  performances of great pianists and singers. A hundred blowers of  brass, scrapers of strings, and tootlers on windy wood, labor beneath  him transmuting the composer's mysterious symbols into living sound,  and when it is all over we frequently find that it seems all to have  been done for the greater glory of the conductor instead of the glory  of art. That, however, is a digression which it is not necessary to  pursue.    [Sidenote: _Mistaken popular notions._]    [Sidenote: _What the conductor does._]    [Sidenote: _Rests and cues._]    Questions and remarks have frequently been addressed to me indicative  of the fact that there is a widespread popular conviction that the  mission of a conductor is chiefly ornamental at an orchestral  concert. That is a sad misconception, and grows out of the old notion  that a conductor is only a time-beater. Assuming that the men of the  band have played sufficiently together, it is thought that eventually  they might keep time without the help of the conductor. It is true  that the greater part of the conductor's work is done at rehearsal, at  which he enforces upon his men his wishes concerning the speed of the  music, expression, and the balance of tone between the different  instruments. But all the injunctions given at rehearsal by word of  mouth are reiterated by means of a system of signs and signals during  the concert performance. Time and rhythm are indicated by the  movements of the baton, the former by the speed of the beats, the  latter by the direction, the tones upon which the principal stress is  to fall being indicated by the down-beat of the baton. The amplitude  of the movements also serves to indicate the conductor's wishes  concerning dynamic variations, while the left hand is ordinarily used  in pantomimic gestures to control individual players or groups.  Glances and a play of facial expression also assist in the guidance of  the instrumental body. Every musician is expected to count the rests  which occur in his part, but when they are of long duration (and  sometimes they amount to a hundred measures or more) it is customary  for the conductor to indicate the entrance of an instrument by a  glance at the player. From this mere outline of the communications  which pass between the conductor and his band it will be seen how  indispensable he is if music is to have a consistent and vital  interpretation.    [Sidenote: _Personal magnetism._]    The layman will perhaps also be enabled, by observing the actions of a  conductor with a little understanding of their purposes, to appreciate  what critics mean when they speak of the \"magnetism\" of a leader. He  will understand that among other things it means the aptitude or  capacity for creating a sympathetic relationship between himself and  his men which enables him the better by various devices, some  arbitrary, some technical and conventional, to imbue them with his  thoughts and feelings relative to a composition, and through them to  body them forth to the audience.    [Sidenote: _The score._]    [Sidenote: _Its arrangement._]    [Sidenote: _Score reading._]    What it is that the conductor has to guide him while giving his mute  commands to his forces may be seen in the reproduction, in the  Appendix, of a page from an orchestral score (Plate XII). A score, it  will be observed, is a reproduction of all the parts of a composition  as they lie upon the desks of the players. The ordering of these parts  in the score has not always been as now, but the plan which has the  widest and longest approval is that illustrated in our example. The  wood-winds are grouped together on the uppermost six staves, the brass  in the middle with the tympani separating the horns and trumpets from  the trombones, the strings on the lowermost five staves. The example  has been chosen because it shows all the instruments of the band  employed at once (it is the famous opening _tutti_ of the triumphal  march of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony), and is easy of comprehension by  musical amateurs for the reason that none of the parts requires  transposition except it be an octave up in the case of the piccolo,  an instrument of four-foot tone, and an octave down in the case of the  double-basses, which are of sixteen-foot tone. All the other parts are  to be read as printed, proper attention being given to the alto and  tenor clefs used in the parts of the trombones and violas. The ability  to \"read score\" is one of the most essential attributes of a  conductor, who, if he have the proper training, can bring all the  parts together and reproduce them on the pianoforte, transposing those  which do not sound as written and reading the different clefs at sight  as he goes along.          V    _At an Orchestral Concert_      [Sidenote: _Classical and Popular._]    [Sidenote: _Orchestras and military bands._]    In popular phrase all high-class music is \"classical,\" and all  concerts at which such music is played are \"classical concerts.\" Here  the word is conceived as the antithesis of \"popular,\" which term is  used to designate the ordinary music of the street and music-hall.  Elsewhere I have discussed the true meaning of the word and shown its  relation to \"romantic\" in the terminology of musical critics and  historians. No harm is done by using both \"classical\" and \"popular\" in  their common significations, so far as they convey a difference in  character between concerts. The highest popular conception of a  classical concert is one in which a complete orchestra performs  symphonies and extended compositions in allied forms, such as  overtures, symphonic poems, and concertos. Change the composition of  the instrumental body, by omitting the strings and augmenting the reed  and brass choirs, and you have a military band which is best employed  in the open air, and whose programmes are generally made up of  compositions in the simpler and more easily comprehended  forms--dances, marches, fantasias on popular airs, arrangements of  operatic excerpts and the like. These, then, are popular concerts in  the broadest sense, though it is proper enough to apply the term also  to concerts given "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17478"],[0,"Great Pictures, As Seen and Described (#14)"],[1,"the ideal freshness of this painting, delicate as a miniature in a  missal, and whose tints are borrowed from the whiteness of the lily, the  rose of the dawn, the blue of the sky, and the gold of the stars. No  muddy tones of earth dull these seraphic beings composed of luminous  vapours. Upon a throne with marble steps, the varied colours of which  are symbolic, Christ is seated, holding a crown of rich workmanship  which he is about to place upon the head of his divine mother, kneeling  before him, with her head modestly inclined and her hands crossed upon  her breast. Around the throne, throng a choir of angel-musicians,  playing the trumpet, the theorbo, the _angelot_, and the _viola d'  amore_. A light flame flutters about their heads and their great wings  palpitate with joy at this glorious coronation which will transform the  humble handmaid of the Lord into the Lady of Paradise. To the left, an  angel kneels in prayer. In the lower part of the painting with faces  uplifted to the sky the hosts of the blessed, distributed in two  groups, adore and contemplate. On one side, are Moses, Saint John the  Baptist, the apostles, the bishops, and the founders of orders,  distinguished by some emblem, and for greater certainty bearing their  names inscribed around their nimbus, or upon the embroideries of their  vestments. Saint Dominick holds a branch of lilies and a book. A sun  forms the agrafe of Saint Thomas Aquinas's mantle; Charlemagne,  \"_l'empereur a la barbe fleurie_,\" is recognizable by his crown of  _fleur-de-lis_. Saint Nicholas, bishop of Myra, has by his side the  three balls of gold, symbolic of the three purses which he gave to a  poor gentleman to dower his three daughters whose beauty exposed them to  dangers. On the other side, throng King David, apostles, martyrs, Saint  Peter the Dominican with his wounded head, Saint Laurence holding his  gridiron, Saint Stephen with a palm in his hand, and Saint George armed  from head to foot; then, in the foreground of the picture, is the  charming group of saints of perfectly celestial grace: the kneeling  Magdalen offers her vase of perfumes; Saint Caecilia advances, crowned  with roses; Saint Clara gleams through her veil, constellated with  crosses and golden stars; Saint Catherine of Alexandria leans upon the  wheel, the instrument of her execution, as calmly and peacefully as if  it were a spinning-wheel; and Saint Agnes holds in her arms a little  white lamb, the symbol of innocent purity.    [Illustration: THE CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN.          _Fra Angelico._]    Fra Beato Angelico has given to these youthful saints a celestial and  ideal beauty, whose type exists not upon this earth: they are visible  souls, rather than bodies, they are thoughts of human form enveloped in  these chaste draperies of white, rose, and blue, sown with stars and  embroidered, clothed as might be the happy spirits who rejoice in the  eternal light of Paradise. If there be paintings in Heaven, surely they  must resemble those of Fra Angelico.        _Guide de l'Amateur au Musee du Louvre_ (Paris, 1882).          JUDITH    (_SANDRO BOTTICELLI_)    MAURICE HEWLETT      In the days when it was verging on a question whether a man could be at  the same time a good Christian and an artist the chosen subjects of  painting were significant of the approaching crisis--those glaring moral  contrasts in history which, for want of a happier term, we call  dramatic. Why this was so, whether Art took a hint from Politics, or had  withdrawn her more intimate manifestations to await likelier times, is a  question it were long to answer. The subjects, at any rate, were such as  the Greeks, with their surer instincts and saving grace of sanity in  matters of this kind, either forbore to meddle with or treated as  decoratively as they treated acanthus-wreaths. To-day we call them  \"effective\" subjects; we find they produce shocks and tremors; we think  it braces us to shudder, and we think that Art is a kind of emotional  pill; we measure it quantitatively, and say that we \"know what we like.\"  And doubtless there is something piquant in the quivering produced, for  example, by the sight of white innocence fluttering helpless in a grey  shadow of lust. So long as the Bible remained a god that piquancy was  found in a _Massacre of the Innocents_; in our own time we find it in a  _Faust and Gretchen_, in the Dore Gallery, or in the Royal Academy.  It was a like appreciation of the certain effect of vivid contrasts as  powerful didactic agents (coupled with, or drowning, a something purer  and more devout) which had inspired those most beautiful and distinctive  of all the symbols of Catholicism, the _Adoration of the Kings_, the  Christ-child cycle, and which raised the Holy Child and Maid-Mother to  their place above the mystic tapers and the Cross. Naturally the Old  Testament, that garner of grim tales, proved a sick wine: _David and  Golias_, _Susanna and the Elders_, the _Sacrifice of Isaac_, _Jethro's  Daughter_. But the story of Judith did not come to be painted in Tuscan  sanctuaries until Donatello of Florence had first cast her in bronze at  the prayer of Cosimo _pater patriae_. Her entry was dramatic enough at  least: Dame Fortune may well have sniggered as she spun round the city  on her ball. Cosimo the patriot and his splendid grandson were no sooner  dead and their brood sent flying, than Donatello's _Judith_ was set up  in the Piazza as a fit emblem of rescue from tyranny, with the vigorous  motto, to make assurance double, \"EXEMPLVM SALVTIS PVBLICAE CIVES  POSVERE.\" Savonarola, who knew his Bible, saw here a keener application  of Judith's pious sin. A few years later that same _Judith_ saw him  burn. Thus, as an incarnate cynicism, she will pass; as a work of art  she is admittedly one of her great creator's failures. Her neighbour  _Perseus_ of the Loggia makes this only too plain! For Cellini has  seized the right moment in a deed of horror, and Donatello, with all his  downrightness and grip of the fact, has hit upon the wrong. It is fatal  to freeze a moment of time into an eternity of writing. His _Judith_  will never strike: her arm is palsied where it swings. The Damoclean  sword is a fine incident for poetry; but Holofernes was no Damocles, and  if he had been, it were intolerable to cast his experience in bronze.  Donatello has essayed that thing impossible for sculpture, to arrest a  moment instead of denote a permanent attribute. Art is adjectival, is it  not, O Donatello? Her business is to qualify facts, to say what things  are, not to state them, to affirm that they are. A sculptured _Judith_  was done not long afterwards, carved, as we shall see, with a burin on a  plate; and the man who so carved her was a painter.    [Illustration: JUDITH.          _Botticelli._]    Meantime, _pari passu_, almost, a painter who was a poet was trying his  hand; a man who knew his Bible and his mythology and was equally at home  with either. Perhaps it is not extravagant to say that you cannot be an  artist unless you are at home with mythology, unless mythology is the  swiftest and most direct expression of your being, so that you can be  measured by it as a man is known by his books, or a woman by her  clothes, her way of bowing, her amusements, or her charities. For  mythopoeia is just this, the incarnating the spirit of natural fact;  and the generic name of that power is Art. A kind of creation, a  clothing of essence in matter, an hypostatizing (if you will have it) of  an object of intuition within the folds of an object of sense. Lessing  did not dig so deep as his Greek Voltaire (whose \"dazzling antithesis,\"  after all, touches the root of the matter), for he did not see that  rhythmic extension in time or space, as the case may be, with all that  that implies--colour, value, proportion, all the convincing incidents of  form--is simply the mode of all arts, the thing with which Art's  substance must be interpenetrated, until the two form a whole, lovely,  golden, irresistible, and inevitable as Nature's pieces are. This  substance, as I have said, is the spirit of natural fact. And so  mythology is Art at its simplest and barest (where the bodily medium is  neither word, nor texture of stone, nor dye), the parent art from which  all the others were, so to speak, begotten by man's need. This much of  explanation, I am sorry to say, is necessary, before we turn to our  mytho-poet of Florence, to see what he made out of the story of Judith.    First of all, though, what has the story of Judith to do with mythology?  It is a legend, one of the finest of Semitic legends; and between legend  and myth there is as great a gulf as between Jew and Greek. I believe  there are no myths proper to Israel--I do not see how such magnificent  egoists could contract to the necessary state of awe--and I do not know  that there are any legends proper to Greece which are divorced from real  myths. For where a myth is the incarnation of the spirit of natural  fact, a legend is the embellishment of an historical event: a very  different thing. A natural fact is permanent and elemental, an  historical event is transient and superficial. Take one instance out of  a score. The rainbow links heaven and earth. Iris, then, to the  myth-making Greek, was Jove's messenger, intermediary between God and  Man. That is to incarnate a constant, natural fact. Plato afterwards,  making her a daughter of Thaumas, incarnated a fact, psychological, but  none the less constant, none the less natural. But, to say, as the  legend-loving Jew said, that Noah floated his ark over a drowning world  and secured for his posterity a standing covenant with God, who then and  once for all set his bow in the heavens; that is to indicate, somewhere,  in the dim backward and abysm of time, an historical event. The rainbow  is suffered as the skirt of the robe of Noah, who was an ancestor of  Israel. So the"]]]
