If, you say, God made her great, how is that her fault? Why  should I hurt her? I reply, God has done me harm. Is that my fault? I  do not wish to hurt her, but if hurting her benefits me, why should I  not do it? Who does not seek his own advantage? Now I want money; I  can't endure servitude any longer. Where will money come from? From  the Datta house--where else? To get the Datta money, then, must be my  object. Every one knows that Nagendra Babu's eyes have fallen on  Kunda; the Babu worships her. What great people wish, they can  accomplish. The only obstacle is Surja Mukhi. If the two should  quarrel, then the great Surja Mukhi's wish will no longer be regarded.  Now, let me see if I cannot bring about a quarrel. If that is done,  the Babu will be free to worship Kunda. At present Kunda is but an  innocent, but I will make her wise; I will soon bring her into  subjection. She can be of much assistance to me. If I give my mind to  it, I can make her do what I will. If the Babu devotes himself to  Kunda, he will do what she bids him; and she shall do what I bid her.  So shall I receive the fruits of his devotion. If I am not to serve  longer, this is the way it must be brought about. I will give Kunda  Nandini to Nagendra, but not suddenly. I will hide her for a few days  and see what happens. Love is deepened by separation. If I keep them  apart the Babu's love will ripen. Then I will bring out Kunda and give  her to him. Then if Surja Mukhi's fate is not broken, it must be a  very strong fate. In the meantime I will mould Kunda to my will. But,  first, I must send my grandmother to Kamarghat, else I cannot keep  Kunda hidden.\"    [Footnote 12: _Vasudeva_--the father of Krishna.]    With this design, Hira set about her arrangements. On some pretext she  induced her grandmother to go to the house of a relative in the  village of Kamarghat, and kept Kunda closely concealed in her own  house. Kunda, seeing all her zeal and care, thought to herself, \"There  is no one living so good as Hira. Even Kamal does not love me so  much.\"          CHAPTER XVII.    HIRA'S QUARREL. THE BUD OF THE POISON TREE.      \"Yes, that will do. Kunda shall submit. But if we do not make Surja  Mukhi appear as poison in the eyes of Nagendra, nothing can be  accomplished.\"    So Hira set herself to divide the hearts hitherto undivided.    One morning early, the wicked Hira came into her mistress's house  ready for work. There was a servant in the Datta household named  Kousalya, who hated Hira because she was head servant and enjoyed the  favour of the mistress. Hira said to her: \"Sister Kushi, I feel very  strange to-day; will you do my work for me?\"    Kousalya feared Hira, therefore she said: \"Of course I will do it; we  are all subject to illness, and all the subjects of one mistress.\"    It had been Hira's wish that Kousalya should give no reply, and she  would make that a pretext for a quarrel. So, shaking her head, she  said: \"You presume so far as to abuse me?\"    Astonished, Kousalya said: \"When did I abuse any one?\"    \"What!\" said Hira, angrily, \"you deny it? Why did you speak of my  illness? Do you think I am going to die? You hope that I am ill that  you may show people how good you are to me. May you be ill yourself.\"    \"Be it so! Why are you angry, sister? You must die some day; Death  will not forget you, nor will he forget me.\"    \"May Death never forget you! You envy me! May you die of envy! May  your life be short! Go to destruction! May blindness seize upon you!\"    Kousalya could bear no more. She began to return these good wishes in  similar terms. In the act of quarrelling Kousalya was the superior.  Therefore Hira got her deserts.    Then Hira went to complain to her mistress. If any one could have  looked at her as she went, they would have seen no signs of anger on  her face, but rather a smile on her lips. But when she reached her  mistress, her face expressed great anger, and she began by using the  weapon given by God to woman--that is to say, she shed a flood of  tears.    Surja Mukhi inquired into the cause. On hearing the complaint, she  judged that Hira was in fault. Nevertheless, for her sake, she scolded  Kousalya slightly.    Not being satisfied with that, Hira said: \"You must dismiss that  woman, or I will not remain.\"    Then Surja Mukhi was much vexed with Hira, and said: \"You are very  encroaching, Hira; you began the quarrel, the fault was entirely  yours, and now you want me to dismiss the woman. I will do nothing so  unjust. Go, if you will. I will not bid you stay.\"    This was just what Hira wanted. Saying \"Very well, I go,\" her eyes  streaming with tears, she presented herself before the Babu in the  outer apartments.    The Babu was alone in the _boita khana_--he was usually alone now.  Seeing Hira weeping, he asked, \"Why do you weep, Hira?\"    \"I have been told to come for my wages.\"    Nagendra, astonished, asked: \"What has happened?\"    \"I am dismissed. _Ma Thakurani_ (the mistress) has dismissed me.\"    \"What have you done?\" asked Nagendra.    \"Kushi abused me; I complained: the mistress believes her account and  dismisses me.\"    Nagendra, shaking his head and laughing, said: \"That is not a likely  story, Hira; tell the truth.\"    Hira then, speaking plainly, said: \"The truth is I will not stay.\"    \"Why?\"    \"The mistress has become quite altered. One never knows what to expect  from her.\"    Nagendra, frowning, said in a sharp voice: \"What does that mean?\"    Hira now brought in the fact she had wished to report.    \"What did she not say that day to Kunda Nandini Thakurani? On hearing  it, Kunda left the house. Our fear is that some day something of the  same kind should be said to us. We could not endure that, therefore I  chose to anticipate it.\"    \"What are you talking about?\" asked Nagendra.    \"I cannot tell you for shame.\"    Nagendra's brow became dark. He said: \"Go home for to-day; I will call  you to-morrow.\"    Hira's desire was accomplished. With this design she had quarrelled  with Kousalya.    Nagendra rose and went to Surja Mukhi. Stepping lightly, Hira followed  him.    Taking Surja Mukhi aside, he asked, \"Have you dismissed Hira?\"    Surja Mukhi replied, \"Yes,\" and then related the particulars.    On hearing them, Nagendra said: \"Let her go. What did you say to Kunda  Nandini?\"    Nagendra saw that Surja Mukhi turned pale.    \"What did I say to her?\" she stammered.    \"Yes; what evil words did you use to her?\"    Surja Mukhi remained silent some moments. Then she said--    \"You are my all, my present and my future; why should I hide anything  from you? I did speak harshly to Kunda; then, fearing you would be  angry, I said nothing to you about it. Forgive me that offence; I am  telling you all.\"    Then she related the whole matter frankly, from the discovery of the  _Boisnavi_ Haridasi to the reproof she had given to Kunda. At the end  she said--    \"I am deeply sorrowful that I have driven Kunda Nandini away. I have  sent everywhere in search of her. If I had found her, I would have  brought her back.\"    Nagendra said--    \"Your fault is not great. Could any respectable man's wife, hearing of  such a stain, give refuge to the guilty person? But would it not have  been well to think a little whether the charge was true? Did you not  know of the talk about Tara Charan's house? Had you not heard that  Debendra had been introduced to Kunda three years before? Why did you  believe a drunkard's words?\"    \"I did not think of that at the time. Now I do. My mind was  wandering.\" As she spoke the faithful wife sank at Nagendra's feet,  and clasping them with her hands, wetted them with her tears. Then  raising her face, she said: \"Oh, dearer than life, I will conceal  nothing that is in my mind.\"    Nagendra said: \"You need not speak; I know that you suspect me of  feeling love for Kunda Nandini.\"    Surja Mukhi, hiding her face at the feet of her husband, wept. Again  raising her face, sad and tearful as the dew-drenched lily, and  looking into the face of him who could remove all her sorrows, she  said: \"What can I say? Can I tell you what I have suffered? Only lest  my death might increase your sorrow, I do not die. Otherwise, when I  knew that another shared your heart, I wished to die. But people  cannot die by wishing to do so.\"    Nagendra remained long silent; then, with a heavy sigh, he said--    \"Surja Mukhi, the fault is entirely mine, not yours at all. I have  indeed been unfaithful to you; in truth, forgetting you, my heart has  gone out towards Kunda Nandini. What I have suffered, what I do  suffer, how can I tell you? You think I have not tried to conquer it;  but you must not think so. You could never reproach me so bitterly as  I have reproached myself. I am sinful; I cannot rule my own heart.\"    Surja Mukhi could endure no more. With clasped hands, she entreated  bitterly--    \"Tell me no more; keep it to yourself. Every word you say pierces my  breast like a dart. What was written in my destiny has befallen me. I  wish to hear no more; it is not fit for me to hear.\"    \"Not so, Surja Mukhi,\" replied Nagendra; \"you must listen. Let me  speak what I have long striven to say. I will leave this house; I will  not die, but I will go elsewhere. Home and family no longer give me  happiness. I have no pleasure with you. I am not fit to be your  husband. I will trouble you no longer. I will find Kunda Nandini, and  will go with her to another place. Do you remain mistress of this  house. Regard yourself as a widow--since your husband is so base, are  you not a widow? But, base as I am, I will not deceive you. Now I go:  if I am able to forget Kunda, I will come again; if not, this is my  last hour with you.\"    What could Surja Mukhi say to these heart-piercing words? For some  moments she stood like a statue, gazing on the ground. Then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#14)"],[1," a trifle for a work whose transcendent success enabled him to build  a new opera-house and laid the foundation of a large fortune. We are  told, too, that at the time of Mozart's death in extreme want, when his  sick wife, half maddened with grief, could not buy a coffin for the dead  composer, this hard-hearted wretch, who owed his all to the genius of  the great departed, rushed about through Vienna bewailing the loss to  music with sentimental tears, but did not give the heart-broken widow  one kreutzer to pay the expense of a decent burial.    In 1791 Mozart's health was breaking down with great rapidity, though  he himself would never recognize his own swiftly advancing fate. He  experienced, however, a deep melancholy which nothing could remove. For  the first time his habitual cheerfulness deserted him. His wife had been  enabled through the kindness of her friends to visit the healing waters  of Baden, and was absent.    An incident now occurred which impressed Mozart with an ominous chill.  One night there came a stranger, singularly dressed in gray, with an  order for a requiem to be composed without fail within a month. The  visitor, without revealing his name, departed in mysterious gloom, as  he came. Again the stranger called and solemnly reminded Mozart of his  promise. The composer easily persuaded himself that this was a visitor  from the other world, and that the requiem would be his own; for he  was exhausted with labor and sickness, and easily became the prey of  superstitious fancies. When his wife returned, she found him with a  fatal pallor on his face, silent and melancholy, laboring with intense  absorption on the funereal mass. He would sit brooding over the score  till he swooned away in his chair, and only come to consciousness to  bend his waning energies again to their ghastly work. The mysterious  visitor, whom Mozart believed to be the precursor of his death, we now  know to have been Count Walseck, who had recently lost his wife, and  wished a musical memorial.    His final sickness attacked the composer while laboring at the requiem.  The musical world was ringing with the fame of his last opera. To the  dying man was brought the offer of the rich appointment of organist of  St. Stephen's Cathedral. Most flattering propositions were made him by  eager managers, who had become thoroughly awake to his genius when it  was too late. The great Mozart was dying in the very prime of his youth  and his powers, when success was in his grasp and the world opening wide  its arms to welcome his glorious gifts with substantial recognition;  but all too late; for he was doomed to die in his spring-tide, though \"a  spring mellow with all the fruits of autumn.\"    The unfinished requiem lay on the bed, and his last efforts were to  imitate some peculiar instrumental effects, as he breathed out his life  in the arms of his wife and his friend Suessmaier.    The epilogue to this life-drama is one of the saddest in the history of  art: a pauper funeral for one of the world's greatest geniuses. \"It was  late one winter afternoon,\" says an old record, \"before the coffin was  deposited on the side aisles on the south side of St. Stephen's. Van  Swieten, Salieri, Suessmaier, and two unknown musicians were the only  persons present besides the officiating priest and the pall-bearers.  It was a terribly inclement day; rain and sleet came down fast; and an  eye-witness describes how the little band of mourners stood shivering  in the blast, with their umbrellas up, round the hearse, as it left  the door of the church. It was then far on in the dark cold December  afternoon, and the evening was fast closing in before the solitary  hearse had passed the Stubenthor, and reached the distant graveyard of  St. Marx, in which, among the 'third class,' the great composer of the  'G minor Symphony' and the 'Requiem' found his resting-place. By this  time the weather had proved too much for all the mourners; they had  dropped off one by one, and Mozart's body was accompanied only by the  driver of the carriage. There had been already two pauper funerals that  day--one of them a midwife--and Mozart was to be the third in the grave  and the uppermost.    \"When the hearse drew up in the slush and sleet at the gate of the  graveyard, it was welcomed by a strange pair, Franz Harruschka, the  assistant grave-digger, and his mother Katharina, known as 'Frau Katha,'  who filled the quaint office of official mendicant to the place.    \"The old woman was the first to speak: 'Any coaches or mourners coming?'    \"A shrug from the driver of the hearse was the only response.    \"'Whom have you got there, then?' continued she.    \"'A band-master,' replied the other.    \"'A musician? they're a poor lot; then I've no more money to look for  to-day. It is to be hoped we shall have better luck in the morning.'    \"To which the driver said, with a laugh: 'I'm devilish thirsty, too--not  a kreutzer of drink-money have I had.'    \"After this curious colloquy the coffin was dismounted and shoved into  the top of the grave already occupied by the two paupers of the morning;  and such was Mozart's last appearance on earth.\"    To-day no stone marks the spot where were deposited the last remains  of one of the brightest of musical spirits; indeed, the very grave is  unknown, for it was the grave of a pauper.      IV.    Mozart's charming letters reveal to us such a gentle, sparkling,  affectionate nature, as to inspire as much love for the man as  admiration for his genius. Sunny humor and tenderness bubble in almost  every sentence. A clever writer says that \"opening these is like  opening a painted tomb.... The colors are all fresh, the figures are all  distinct.\"    No better illustration of the man Mozart can be had than in a few  extracts from his correspondence.    He writes to his sister from Rome while yet a mere lad:    \"I am, thank God! except my miserable pen, well, and send you and mamma  a thousand kisses. I wish you were in Rome; I am sure it would please  you. Papa says I am a little fool, but that is nothing new. Here we have  but one bed; it is easy to understand that I can't rest comfortably  with papa. I shall be glad when we get into new quarters. I have just  finished drawing the Holy Peter with his keys, the Holy Paul with his  sword, and the Holy Luke with my sister. I have had the honor of kissing  St. Peter's foot; and because I am so small as to be unable to reach it,  they had to lift me up. I am the same old  \"Wolfgang.\"    Mozart was very fond of this sister Nannerl, and he used to write to  her in a playful mosaic of French, German, and Italian. Just after his  wedding he writes:    \"My darling is now a hundred times more joyful at the idea of going to  Salzburg, and I am willing to stake--ay, my very life, that you will  rejoice still more in my happiness when you know her; if, indeed, in  your estimation, as in mine, a high-principled, honest, virtuous, and  pleasing wife ought to make a man happy.\"    Late in his short life he writes the following characteristic note to a  friend, whose life does not appear to have been one of the most regular:    \"Now tell me, my dear friend, how you are. I hope you are all as well as  we are. You cannot fail to be happy, for you possess everything that  you can wish for at your age and in your position, especially as you  now seem to have entirely given up your former mode of life. Do you not  every day become more convinced of the truth of the little lectures I  used to inflict on you? Are not the pleasures of a transient, capricious  passion widely different from the happiness produced by rational and  true love? I feel sure that you often in your heart thank me for my  admonitions. I shall feel quite proud if you do. But, jesting apart,  you do really owe me some little gratitude if you are become worthy of  Fraeulein N------, for I certainly played no insignificant part in your  improvement or reform.    \"My great-grandfather used to say to his wife, my great-grandmother,  who in turn told it to her daughter, my mother, who repeated it to her  daughter, my own sister, that it was a very great art to talk eloquently  and well, but an equally great one to know the right moment to stop. I  therefore shall follow the advice of my sister, thanks to our mother,  grandmother, and great-grandmother, and thus end, not only my moral  ebullition, but my letter.\"    His playful tenderness lavished itself on his wife in a thousand quaint  ways. He would, for example, rise long before her to take his horseback  exercise, and always kiss her sleeping face and leave a little note like  the following resting on her forehead: \"Good-morning, dear little wife!  I hope you have had a good sleep and pleasant dreams. I shall be back in  two hours. Behave yourself like a good little girl, and don't run away  from your husband.\"    Speaking of an infant child, our composer would say merrily, \"That boy  will be a true Mozart, for he always cries in the very key in which I am  playing.\"    Mozart's musical greatness, shown in the symmetry of his art as well as  in the richness of his inspirations, has been unanimously acknowledged  by his brother composers. Meyerbeer could not restrain his tears when  speaking of him. Weber, Mendelssohn, Rossini, and Wagner always praise  him in terms of enthusiastic admiration. Haydn called him the greatest  of composers. In fertility of invention, beauty of form, and exactness  of method, he has never been surpassed, and has but one or two rivals.  The composer of three of the greatest operas in musical history, besides  many of much more than ordinary excellence; of symphonies that rival  Haydn's for symmetry and melodic affluence; of a great number of  quartets, quintets, etc.; and of pianoforte sonatas which rank high  among the best; of many masses that are standard in the service of the  Catholic Church; of a great variety of beautiful songs--there"]]]
