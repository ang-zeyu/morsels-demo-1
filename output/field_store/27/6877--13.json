You were  right, Francisco, it was that beldam Castaldi. She went with them there  in the morning, and left them there, and was to have come in the  gondola for them at six. At three o'clock she arrived, saying that  their father had met with a serious accident, having fallen down the  steps of one of the bridges and broken his leg, and that he had sent  her to fetch them at once.    \"Of course, they left with her instantly. Polani questioned the  lackeys, who had aided them to embark. They said that the gondola was  not one of his boats, but was apparently a hired gondola, with a closed  cabin. The girls had stopped in surprise as they came down the steps,  and Maria said, 'Why, this is not our gondola!'    \"Castaldi replied, 'No, no; our own gondolas had both gone off to find  and bring a leech, and as your father was urgently wanting you, I  hailed the first passing boat. Make haste, dears, your father is  longing for you.'    \"So they got on board at once, and the gondola rowed swiftly away. That  is all I know about it, except that the story was a lie, that their  father never sent for them, and that up to a quarter of an hour ago  they had not reached home.\"        Chapter 5: Finding A Clue.      \"This is awful, Matteo,\" Francis said, when his friend had finished his  story. \"What is to be done?\"    \"That is just the thing, Francisco. What is to be done? My cousin has  been already to the city magistrates, to tell them what has taken  place, and to request their aid in discovering where the girls have  been carried to. I believe that he is going to put up a proclamation,  announcing that he will give a thousand ducats to whomsoever will bring  information which will enable him to recover the girls. That will set  every gondolier on the canals on the alert, and some of them must  surely have noticed a closed gondola rowed by two men, for at this time  of year very few gondolas have their covers on. It seems to be terrible  not to be able to do anything, so I came straight off to tell you.\"    \"You had better send your gondola home, Matteo. It may be wanted. We  will paddle out to the lagoon and talk it over. Surely there must be  something to be done, if we could but think of it.    \"This is terrible, indeed, Matteo,\" he repeated, after they had sat  without speaking for some minutes. \"One feels quite helpless and  bewildered. To think that only yesterday evening we were laughing and  chatting with them, and that now they are lost, and in the power of  that villain Mocenigo, who you may be sure is at the bottom of it.    \"By the way,\" he said suddenly, \"do you know where he has taken up his  abode?\"    \"I heard that he was at Botonda, near Chioggia, a week ago, but whether  he is there still I have not the least idea.\"    \"It seems to me that the thing to do is to find him, and keep him in  sight. He will probably have them hidden away somewhere, and will not  go near them for some time, for he will know that he will be suspected,  and perhaps watched.\"    \"But why should he not force Maria to marry him at once?\" Matteo said.  \"You see, when he has once made her his wife he will be safe, for my  cousin would be driven then to make terms with him for her sake.\"    \"He may try that,\" Francis said; \"but he must know that Maria has  plenty of spirit, and may refuse to marry him, threaten her as he will.  He may think that, after she has been kept confined for some time, and  finds that there is no hope of escape, except by consenting to be his  wife, she may give way. But in any case, it seems to me that the thing  to be done is to find Ruggiero, and to watch his movements.\"    \"I have no doubt my cousin has already taken steps in that direction,\"  Matteo said, \"and I feel sure that, in this case, he will receive the  support of every influential man in Venice, outside the Mocenigo family  and their connections. The carrying off of ladies, in broad daylight,  will be regarded as a personal injury in every family. The last attempt  was different. I do not say it was not bad enough, but it is not like  decoying girls from home by a false message. No one could feel safe, if  such a deed as this were not severely punished.\"    \"Let us go back again, Matteo. It is no use our thinking of anything  until we know what has really been done, and you are sure to be able to  learn, at home, what steps have been taken.\"    On reaching home Matteo learned that Polani, accompanied by two members  of the council, had already started in one of the swiftest of the state  galleys for the mainland. A council had been hastily summoned, and,  upon hearing Polani's narrative, had dispatched two of their number,  with an official of the republic, to Botonda. If Ruggiero was found to  be still there, he was to be kept a prisoner in the house in which he  was staying, under the strictest watch. If he had left, orders were to  be sent, to every town in the Venetian dominions on the mainland, for  his arrest when discovered, and in that case he was to be sent a  prisoner, strongly guarded, to Venice.    Other galleys had been simultaneously dispatched to the various ports,  ordering a strict search of every boat arriving or leaving, and  directing a minute investigation to be made as to the occupants of  every boat that had arrived during the evening or night. The fact that  a thousand ducats were offered, for information which would lead to the  recovery of the girls, was also to be published far and wide.    The news of the abduction had spread, and the greatest indignation was  excited in the city. The sailors from the port of Malamocco came over  in great numbers. They regarded this outrage on the family of the great  merchant as almost a personal insult. Stones were thrown at the windows  of the Palazzo Mocenigo, and an attack would have been made upon it,  had not the authorities sent down strong guards to protect it. Persons  belonging to that house, and the families connected with it, were  assaulted in the streets, and all Venice was in an uproar.    \"There is one comfort,\" Giuseppi said, when he heard from Francis what  had taken place. \"Just at present, Mocenigo will have enough to think  about his own affairs without troubling about you. I have been in a  tremble ever since that day, and have dreamed bad dreams every night.\"    \"You are more nervous for me than I am for myself, Giuseppi; but I have  been careful too, for although Ruggiero himself was away his friends  are here, and active, too, as you see by this successful attempt. But I  think that at present they are likely to let matters sleep. Public  opinion is greatly excited over the affair, and as, if I were found  with a stab in my back, it would, after what has passed, be put down to  them, I think they will leave me alone.\"    \"I do hope, father,\" Francis said at breakfast the next morning, \"that  there may be no opportunity of sending me back to England, until  something is heard of the Polanis.\"    \"I have somewhat changed my mind, Francis, as to that matter. After  what Signor Polani said the other day, I feel that it would be foolish  for me to adhere to that plan. With his immense trade and business  connections he can do almost anything for you, and such an introduction  into business is so vastly better than your entering my shop in the  city, that it is best, in every way, that you should stay here for the  present. Of course, for the time he will be able to think of nothing  but his missing daughters; but at any rate, you can remain here until  he has leisure to pursue the subject, and to state, further than he did  the other day, what he proposes for you. My own business is a good one  for a London trader, but it is nothing by the side of the transactions  of the merchant princes at Venice, among the very first of whom Signor  Polani is reckoned.\"    Francis was greatly pleased at his father's words. He had, ever since  Polani had spoken to him, been pondering the matter in his mind. He  knew that to enter business under his protection would be one of the  best openings that even Venice could afford; but his father was slow to  change his plans, and Francis greatly feared that he would adhere to  his original plan.    \"I was hoping, father, that you would think favourably of what Signor  Polani said, although, of course, I kept silence, knowing that you  would do what was best for me. And now I would ask you if you will,  until this matter is cleared up, excuse me from my tasks. I should  learn nothing did I continue at them, for my mind would be ever running  upon Signor Polani's daughters, and I should be altogether too restless  to apply myself. It seems to me, too, that I might, as I row here and  there in my gondola, obtain some clue as to their place of  concealment.\"    \"I do not see how you could do that, Francis, when so many others, far  better qualified than yourself, will be on the lookout. Still, as I  agree with you that you are not likely to apply your mind diligently to  your tasks, and as, indeed, you will shortly be giving them up  altogether, I grant your request.\"    Polani returned in the evening to Venice. Ruggiero Mocenigo had been  found. He professed great indignation at the accusation brought against  him, of being concerned in the abduction of the ladies, and protested  furiously when he heard that, until they were found, he was to consider  himself a prisoner. Signor Polani considered that his indignation was  feigned, but he had no doubt as to the reality of his anger at finding  that he was to be confined to his house under a guard.    Immediately after his return, Polani sent his gondola for Francis. He  was pacing up and down the room when the lad arrived.    \"Your suspicions have turned out correct, as you see, Francis. Would to  Heaven I had acted upon them at once, and then this would not have  happened.

The rats did that, but it was all they did, except  hurt their noses presently, and delicate, pink, hand-like fore-paws,  and make 'em bleed on prickles.  They were very angry indeed, those  unspeakable ones--very angry; but it didn't make any difference to the  hedgehogs.  They were there; they were rolled up; they were together.  What _could_ make any difference after _that_?  And at last, when the  rats gave them up as a very bad job, they went away _together_, and  that's all there is to say.  _Together_ clinches it, you understand.          V    PHARAOH      I    Upon a day Hawkley came to the district, and took up his abode in a  cottage of four rooms.  He \"did\" for himself.  Every housekeeper will  know what \"did\" for himself means.  But he did for himself in another  way also.  He came to read up for an exam.  He told everybody this,  which was one reason why he would be seen at ungodly hours, when no one  was about, going to and from lonely spots, with a pair of blue glasses  on his nose, a book under one arm, and a walking-stick with a silver  band and a tassel--he was always careful to display the silver band and  the tassel--under the other.    Then Nemesis descended upon him.    He was caught by Colonel Lymington's head-keeper on Colonel Lymington's  most strictly preserved wild-bird sanctuary, shooting certain rare  birds--many rare birds.  Now, the colonel prided himself on his  sanctuary, and upon the number of rare birds he had living therein, and  the colonel was wroth.  Hawkley had, in fact, ruined the sanctuary, and  taken or slain pretty well every other bird worth having in the place,  so that five years would not make good the harm he had done.  Moreover,  it was shown in the evidence that Hawkley had been able to accomplish  his work by aid of a folding pocket-rifle with a silencer on, and his  cat--especially the cat, whose name was Pharaoh.    No words of the keeper's could be found sufficiently to revile that  cat.  Indeed, the head-keeper went speechless, and nearly had epilepsy,  in trying to describe it to the Court, and if it had done only one-half  the things that the keeper asserted, it must have been a very  remarkable beast indeed; the magistrate said so.  In consequence  Hawkley got rather heavily fined, and went.  He went more quickly than  was expected, because the police got a telephone message from the  police of another district--several other districts, I think--to say  that he was \"wanted\" for precisely the same game there: and Hawkley  must have expected this, for he walked out of the court with a grin on  his face, and was no more seen.    So quickly did he go that he had no time to take the cat.  He left it  at home in the cottage--which shows that he must have been badly  scared, for such a cat must have been worth a lot to a collector's  agent, such as Hawkley was.  But perhaps he left it by way of revenge.  I do not know.  Anyway, there it was in his cottage, asleep on the sofa  before the fire--just as Hawkley, at the invitation of the authorities,  had left it that morning.    It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when the cat, Pharaoh, woke  up, and transformed himself instantly from deep sleep to strained  alertness, in that way which is peculiar to the children of the wild,  but has been lost by their domestic degenerates.  The sun was shining  full in at the little diamond-paned window.  The window was open, and a  late fly of metallic hue was shooting about with a pinging noise, like  the twang of some instrumental string.  But neither fly, nor sun, nor  the tick of the little clock on the mantelpiece had awakened the cat.  It was the click of the little front-gate latch.    The cat--the pupils of his eyes like vertical slits in green-yellow  stone--gave one quick look at, and through, the open window.  He had  the impression, framed in the window, of a bobbing, black, \"square\"  bowler hat--not often seen these days--and a red face with small eyes,  and a sticking-out beard of aggressiveness.  This was no Hawkley.  The  cat knew it, as he knew, probably, the alien tread.  Hawkley had a  white, clean-shaven face, and big eyes--the eyes that an animal may  love and trust.  Possibly the cat knew even the profession of him who  came that way so softly and alone in the still afternoon.  Anyway, he  acted as if he did.    Like a snake, and with rather less noise, Pharaoh slid off the sofa and  to the door leading into the scullery.  For a moment he stopped,  looking back over his shoulder, one paw uplifted, body drooping on bent  legs, inscrutable, fierce eyes staring.  Then he was gone.    I don't know how he went.  He just seemed to fade out in the frame of  the doorway and into the shadowed coolth of the scullery like a  dissolving picture.    A pause followed, while the little clock on the mantel-piece ticked  hurriedly, as if anxious to get on and pass over an awkward moment.    Came then the click of the front-door latch, the flinging open of the  door wide, the bar-like gleam of hastily raised gun-barrels in the new  flood of light, and--silence.  Only the one or two late flies \"pinged,\"  while the little clock fairly raced.    The tall, uncompromising figure of the head-keeper was standing in the  doorway, with a double-barreled 12-bore gun half-raised.    He stood there a moment with his dog, bent a little, peering in.  He  had come to find \"that there pesky cat.\"  And in this, perhaps, he  showed more sense than most people gave him credit for.  Apparently, he  had seen enough to know that the cat was quite unlike any ordinary  cat--and cats of any kind are bad enough--and certainly he guessed that  the cat under control of its master was one, and away from that  questionable influence likely to be another, and very much worse,  calamity.    The keeper searched that cottage from chimney to doorstep.  No cat  there.  His dog did not, as might have been expected, help him in this  search.  Indeed, his dog, he now discovered, had vanished--had, in  fact, gone out at the back-door and cleared off.    Meanwhile the cat was, for his sins, being horribly pricked by the  holly-hedge through which he was sliding.  He growled under the  punishment.  Ordinary domestic cats do not, as a rule, growl in such  cases, though they may \"swear.\"    Once through the hedge, the cat dropped into the ditch on the other  side, turned to his right, and galloped up it.  It ran upwards,  skirting a sloping wet field, to a dark, damp, black wood, as woods  always are that stand on cold clay and have much evergreen growth.  They remind one of a wet, chill rhododendron forest of Tibet.    The cat's gallop was in itself peculiar, loose, long, his head low, his  forepaws straight, his hindlegs trailing out behind.  So does the tiger  gallop across the jungle glade when the beaters rouse him.    There were other things peculiar about Pharaoh also, now that one had  him on the move and could see.  He was, perhaps, a fraction big for his  kind; his coat was yellowish, fading beneath, with \"faint pale stripes\"  well marked on the sides; his tail was long, and oddly slender and  \"whippy,\" ringed faintly to the black tip; his fur was short and harsh,  quite unlike that of a domestic cat, and the expression of his eyes was  one of permanent, unsleeping fierceness.    Once he stopped and stared back, and in the pause which followed one  could distinctly hear a faint but rapidly increasing drumming sound  following his trail up the ditch.  And least of all beasts had that cat  delusions.  He turned and galloped on.  The keeper's dog was of an  independent turn of mind.  He had quietly run that cat's trail,  forgetting that, in the long-run, dogs are not fitted to maneuver  independently, and may suffer if they do so.  You see him flying up the  trail, square nose to ground, tracking really very cleverly indeed, and  with a fine amount of what huntsmen call \"drive.\"    Ho had overtaken Pharaoh before the hunted one could reach the wood.  He realized it as he took the last bend in the ditch, when he saw a  yellow streak rise under his nose, and bound, with all four legs stuck  out quite straight, and claws spread abroad, like a rubber ball out of  his path, avoiding his clumsy, murderous snap by an inch, and then felt  it rebound right on to his back.    The next few seconds were quite crowded, and that dog had the time of  his life.    Even an ordinary domestic \"puss\" can make wonderful havoc of a dog's  back when once it gets there; and stays, as it does, like a burr, and  this one could go a bit better than most; and when that dog at last got  the cat's \"leave to go,\" he went rather sooner than at once,  proclaiming his misery aloud to all the world, so that his master,  coming at that moment out of the back-door of the cottage, heard him  afar off, and swore.    As for the cat, he turned about, all bristling, and went too.  He went  straight up to, and through, the wood, disturbing in clouds the  starlings, who had just come in to roost in the rhododendrons, so that  they rose with a rushing of wings like the voice of a thunder-shower on  forest leaves, and incidentally drenched the cat with a deluge of  raindrops collected in the leaves as he raced through underneath.  A  lesser beast, it may be noted, would have climbed a tree, but Hawkley,  I think, had convinced his cat of that folly when a man might be  following up behind.    Straight through the wood galloped Pharaoh, and into a stretch of  age-old furze, or gorse, if you like, beyond.  That showed strategy.  The furze was a maze of a million spikes, and branches, and twisted,  gnarled stems tough as wire-rope; a wonderful place, all honeycombed  with rabbit-runs; a world unto itself.    The cat moved on quickly into the heart of the furze, pausing every few"]]]
