In Chapter III we discussed sensation, and in  the preceding chapter, the instincts, but when we have described an act  in terms of instinct and sensation, we have not told all the facts.    For example, when a child sees a pretty red ball of yarn, he reaches out  to get it, then puts it into his mouth, or unwinds it, and plays with it  in various ways. It is all a matter of sensation and instinctive  responses. The perception of the ball--seeing the ball--brings about the  instinctive reaching out, grasping the ball, and bringing it to the  mouth. But to complete our account, we must say that the child is  _pleased_. We note a change in his facial expression. His eyes gleam  with pleasure. His face is all smiles, showing pleasant contentment.  Therefore we must say that the child not only sees, not only acts, but  the seeing and acting are _pleasant_. The child continues to look, he  continues to act, because the looking and acting bring joy.    This is typical of situations that bring pleasure. We want them  continued; we act in a way to make them continue. _We go out after the  pleasure-giving thing._    But let us consider a different kind of situation. A child sees on the  hearth a glowing coal. It instinctively reaches out and grasps it,  starts to draw the coal toward it, but instinctively drops it. This is  not, however, the whole story. Instead of the situation being pleasant,  it is decidedly unpleasant. The child fairly howls with pain. His face,  instead of being wreathed in smiles, is covered with tears. He did not  hold on to the coal. He did not try to continue the situation. On the  contrary, he dropped the coal, and withdrew the hand. The body  contracted and shrank away from the situation.    These two cases illustrate the two simple feelings, pleasantness and  unpleasantness. Most situations in life are either pleasant or  unpleasant. Situations may sometimes be neutral; that is, may arouse  neither the feeling of pleasantness or unpleasantness. But usually a  conscious state is either pleasant or unpleasant. A situation brings us  life, joy, happiness. We want it continued and act in a way to bring  about its continuance. Or the situation tends to take away our life,  brings pain, sorrow, grief, and we want it discontinued, and act in a  way to discontinue it.    These two simple forms of feeling perhaps arose in the beginning in  connection with the act of taking food. It is known that if a drop of  acid touches an amoeba, the animal shrinks, contracts, and tries to  withdraw from the death-bringing acid. On the other hand, if a particle  of a substance that is suitable for food touches the animal, it takes  the particle within itself. The particle is life-giving and brings  pleasure.    =The Emotions.= Pleasure and displeasure are the simple feelings. Most  situations in life bring about very complex feeling states known as  _emotions_. The emotions are made up of pleasure or displeasure mixed  or compounded with the sensations from the bodily reactions.    The circulatory system, the respiratory system, and nearly all the  involuntary organs of the body form a great sounding board which  instantly responds in various ways to the situations of life. When the  youth sees the pretty maiden and when he touches her hand, his heart  pumps away at a great rate, his cheeks become flushed, his breathing is  paralyzed, his voice trembles. He experiences the emotion of love. The  state is complex indeed. There is pleasantness, of course, but there is  in addition the feeling of all the bodily reactions.    When the mother sees her dead child lying in its casket, her head falls  over on her breast, her eyes fill with tears, her shoulders droop, her  chest contracts, she sobs, her breathing is spasmodic. Nearly every  organ of the body is affected in one way or another. The state is  _unpleasant_, but there is also the feeling of the manifold bodily  reactions.    So it is always. The biologically important situations in life bring  about, through hereditary connections in the nervous system, certain  typical reactions. These reactions are largely the same for the same  type of situation, and they give the particular coloring to each  emotion. It is evident that the emotions are closely related to the  instincts. The reflexes that take place in emotions are of the same  nature as the instincts. Each instinctive act has its characteristic  emotion. There are fear instincts and fear emotions. Fear is unpleasant.  In addition to its unpleasantness there is a multitude of sensations  that come from the body. The hair stands on end, the heart throbs, the  circulation is hastened, breathing is interrupted, the muscles are  tense. This peculiar mass of sensations, blended with the  unpleasantness, gives the characteristic emotion of fear. But we need  not go into an analysis of the various emotions of love, hate, envy,  grief, jealousy, etc. The reader can do this for himself.[3]    [3] See James' _Psychology, Briefer Course_, Chapter XXIV.    Nearly every organ of the body plays its part in the emotions: the  digestive organs, the liver, the kidneys, the throat and mouth, the  salivary glands, the eyes and tear glands, the skin muscles, the facial  muscles, etc. And every emotion is made up of pleasantness or  unpleasantness and the sensations produced by some combination of bodily  reactions.    It is well for us to remember the part that bodily conditions and states  play in the emotional life. The emotional state of a man depends upon  whether he has had his dinner or is hungry, whether the liver is working  normally, and upon the condition of the various secreting and excreting  organs and glands. In a word, it is evident that our emotions fall  within a world of cause and effect. _Our feeling states are caused._    =Importance in Life.= Our feelings and emotions are the fountains from  which nearly all our volitional actions flow. Feeling is the  _mainspring_ of life. Nearly everything we do is prompted by love, or  hate, or fear, or jealousy, or rivalry, or anger, or grief. If the  feelings have such close relation to action, then the schools must take  them into account, for by education we seek to control action. If the  feelings control action, then we must try to control the feelings. We  must get the child into a right state of mind toward the school, toward  his teacher, and toward his work. The child must like the school, like  the teacher, and _want_ to learn.    Moreover, we must create the right state of mind in connection with  each study, each task. The child must come to feel the need and  importance of each individual task as well as of each subject. The task  is then desirable, it is to be sought for and worked at, it is important  for life.    This is merely enlisting the child's nature in the interest of his  education. For motive, we must always look to the child's nature. The  two great forces which pull and drive are _pleasure_ and _pain_. Nature  has no other methods. Formerly the school used pain as its motive almost  exclusively. The child did his tasks to escape pain. For motive we now  use more often the positive influences which give pleasure, which pull  instead of drive. What will one not do _for_ the _loved_ one? What will  one not do _to_ the _hated_ one? The child who does not love his teacher  gets little good from school while under that teacher. Moreover, school  work is often a failure because it is so unreal, has so little relation  to an actual world, and seems foreign to any real needs of the child. No  one is going to work very hard unless the work is prompted by desire.  Our desires come from our needs.

Now we will have       Some-supper-O, some-supper-O.\"    \"The only riddle I remember is the one about: 'What goes around the  house, and just makes one track?' I believe they said it was a  wheelbarrow. Mighty few people in that settlement believed in such  things as charms. They were too intelligent for that sort of thing.    \"Old man Dillard Love didn't know half of his slaves. They were called  'Love's free niggers.' Some of the white folks in that settlement would  get after their niggers and say 'who do you think you are, you must  think you are one of Dillard Love's free niggers the way you act.' Then  the slave was led to the whipping post and brushed down, and his marster  would tell him, 'now you see who is boss.'    \"Marse Dillard often met a darkey in the road, he would stop and inquire  of him, 'Who's nigger is you?' The darkey would say 'Boss I'se your  nigger.' If Marse Dillard was feeling good he would give the darkey a  present. Heaps of times he gave them as much as five dollars, 'cording  to how good he was feeling. He treated his darkies mighty good.    \"My grandfather belonged to Marse Dillard Love, and when the war was  declared he was too old to go. Marse George Sellars went and was  wounded. You know all about the blanket rolls they carried over their  shoulders. Well, that bullet that hit him had to go all the way through  that roll that had I don't know how many folds, and its force was just  about spent by the time it got to his shoulder; that was why it didn't  kill him, otherwise it would have gone through him. The bullet was  extracted, but it left him with a lame shoulder.    \"Our Mr. Tommy Angel went to the war, and he got so much experience  shooting at the Yankees that he could shoot at a target all day long,  and then cover all the bullet holes he made with the palm of one hand.  Mr. Tommy was at home when the Yankees come though.    \"Folks around our settlement put their darkies on all their good mules  and horses, and loaded them down with food and valuables, then sent them  to the nearby mountains and caves to hide until the soldiers were gone.  Mr. Angel himself told me later that lots of the folks who came around  pilfering after the war, warn't northerners at all, but men from just  anywhere, who had fought in the war and came back home to find all they  had was gone, and they had to live some way.    \"One day my father and another servant were laughing fit to kill at a  greedy little calf that had caught his head in the feed basket. They  thought it was just too funny. About that time a Yankee, in his blue  uniform coming down the road, took the notion the men were laughing at  him. 'What are you laughing at?' he said, and at that they lit out to  run. The man called my father and made him come back, 'cause he was the  one laughing so hard. Father thought the Yankee vas going to shoot him  before he could make him understand they were just laughing at the calf.    \"When the war was over, Mr. Love called his slaves together and told  them they had been set free. He explained everything to them very  carefully, and told them he would make farming arrangements for all that  wanted to stay on there with him. Lots of the darkies left after they  heard about folks getting rich working on the railroads in Tennessee and  about the high wages that were being paid on those big plantations in  Mississippi. Some of those labor agents were powerful smart about  stretching the truth, but those folks that believed them and left home  found out that it's pretty much the same the world over, as far as folks  and human nature is concerned. Those that had even average common sense  got along comfortable and all right in Tennessee and Mississippi, and  those that suffered out there were the sort that are so stupid they  would starve in the middle of a good apple pie. My brother that went  with the others to Tennessee never came back, and we never saw him  again.    \"My father did not want me to leave our home at Franklin, North  Carolina, and come to Georgia, for he had been told Georgia people were  awful mean. There was a tale told us about the Mr. Oglethorpe, who  settled Georgia, bringing over folks from the jails of England to settle  in Georgia and it was said they became the ruling class of the State.  Anyway, I came on just the same, and pretty soon I married a Georgia  girl, and have found the people who live here are all right.\"    Laney eagerly took advantage of the pause that followed to tell of her  mother's owner. \"Mother said that he was an old, old man and would set  in his big armchair 'most all day. When he heard good news from the  soldiers he would drum his fingers on his chair and pat his feet, whilst  he tried to sing, 'Te Deum, Te Deum. Good news today! We won today!'  Whenever he heard the southern armies were losing, he would lie around  moaning and crying out loud. Nobody could comfort him then.\"    John was delighted to talk about religion. \"Yes, mam, after the war,  darkies used to meet at each others' houses for religious services until  they got churches of their own. Those meetings were little more than  just prayermeetings. Our white folks were powerful careful to teach  their slaves how to do the right thing, and long after we were free Mr.  Tommy would give long talks at our meetings. We loved to listen to him  and have him interested in us, for we had never been treated mean like  heaps of the slaves in that neighborhood had.    \"One white man in our county needed the help of the Lord. His name was  Boney Ridley and he just couldn't keep away from liquor. He was an uncle  of that famous preacher and poet, Mr. Caleb Ridley. One day when Mr.  Boney had been drinking hard and kind of out of his head, he was  stretched out on the ground in a sort of stupor. He opened his eyes and  looked at the buzzards circling low over him and said, sort of sick and  fretful-like, 'Git on off, buzzards; I ain't dead yet.'\"    \"The Reverend Doctor George Truett was a fine boy and he has grown into  a splendid man. He is one of God's chosen ones. I well remember the  first time I heard him speak. I was a janitor at the State Normal School  when he was a pupil there in 1887. I still think he is about the  greatest orator I ever listened to. In those days, back in 1887, I  always made it convenient to be doing something around the school room  when time came for him to recite or to be on a debate. After he left  that school he went on to the Seminary at Louisville and he has become  known throughout this country as a great Christian.    \"I started teaching in old field schools with no education but just what  our white folks had taught me. They taught me to read and write, and I  must say I really was a mighty apt person, and took advantage of every  opportunity that came my way to learn. You know, teaching is a mighty  good way to learn. After I had been teaching for some time I went back  to school, but most of my knowledge was gotten by studying what books  and papers I could get hold of and by watching folks who were really  educated; by listening carefully to them, I found I could often learn a  good deal that way.\"    Laney could be quiet no longer. \"My husband,\" she said, \"is a self-made  man. His educated brother, Claude, that graduated from Maryville School  in Tennessee, says that he cannot cope with my husband.\"    John smiled indulgently and continued: \"We were in sad and woeful want  after the war. Once I asked my father why he let us go so hungry and  ragged, and he answered: 'How can we help it? Why, even the white folks  don't have enough to eat and wear now.'    \"Eleven years ago I rented a little farm from. Mr. Jasper Thompson, in  Jackson County. After the boll-weevil got bad I came to the other side  of the river yonder, where I stayed 7 years. By this time most of the  children by my first two wives had grown up and gone off up north. My  first wife's children were Robert, Ella, the twins, Julius and Julia  Anne, (who died soon after they were grown-up), and Charlie, and Dan.  Robert is in Philadelphia, Ella in Cincinnati, and Dan is dead.    \"Fred, George, and Johnny, my second wife's children are all living, but  are scattered in far-off places.    \"Everybody was powerful sorry to hear about Lincoln's assassination. At  that time Jefferson Davis was considered the greatest man that ever  lived, but the effect of Lincoln's life and deeds will live on forever.  His life grows greater in reputation with the years and his wisdom more  apparent.    \"As long as we were their property our masters were mighty careful to  have us doctored up right when there was the least sign of sickness.  There was always some old woman too old for field work that nursed the  sick on the big plantations, but the marsters sent for regular doctors  mighty quick if the patient seemed much sick.    \"After the war we were slower to call in doctors because we had no  money, and that's how I lost my good right eye. If I had gone to the  doctor when it first got hurt it would have been all right now. When we  didn't have money we used to pay the doctor with corn, fodder, wheat,  chickens, pork, or anything we had that he wanted.    \"We learned to use lots of herbs and other home-made remedies during the  war when medicine was scarce at the stores, and some old folks still use  these simple teas and poultices. Comfrey was a herb used much for  poultices on risings, boils, and the like, and tea made from it is said  to be soothing to the nerves. Garlic tea was much used for worms, but it  was also counted a good pneumonia remedy, and garlic poultices helped  folks to breathe when they had grippe or pneumonia. Boneset tea was for  colds.
