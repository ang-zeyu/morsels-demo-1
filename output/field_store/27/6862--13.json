The court of the Pharaohs, with its pomp and its usual assemblage of  officials, both great and small, was revived around the person of  the new sovereign;* the titles of the Amenemhaits and the Usirtasens,  adapted to these \"princes of foreign lands,\"** legitimatised them as  descendants of Horus and sons of the Sun.*** They respected the  local religions, and went so far as to favour those of the gods whose  attributes appeared to connect them with some of their own barbarous  divinities. The chief deity of their worship was Baal, the lord of  all,**** a cruel and savage warrior; his resemblance to Sit, the brother  and enemy of Osiris, was so marked, that he was identified with the  Egyptian deity, with the emphatic additional title of Sutkhu, the Great  Sit.^         * The narrative of the _Sallier Papyrus,_ No. 1, shows us       the civil and military chiefs collected round the Shepherd-       king Apopi, and escorting him in the solemn processions in       honour of the gods. They are followed by the scribes and       magicians, who give him advice on important occasions.         ** Hiqu Situ: this is the title of Abisha at Beni-Hassan,       which is also assumed by Khiani on several small monuments;       Steindorff has attempted to connect it with the name of the       Hyksos.         *** The preamble of the two or three Shepherd-kings of whom       we know anything, contains the two cartouches, the special       titles, and the names of Horus, which formed part of the       title of the kings of pure Egyptian race; thus Apophis IL is       proclaimed to be the living Horus, who joins the two earths       in peace, the good god, Aqnunri, son of the Sun, Apopi, who       lives for ever, on the statues of Mirmashau, which he had       appropriated, and on the pink granite table of offerings in       the Gizeh Museum.         **** The name of Baal, transcribed Baalu, is found on that       of a certain Petebaalu, \"the Gift of Baal,\" who must have       flourished in the time of the last shepherd-kings, or rather       under the Theban kings of the XVIIth dynasty, who were their       contemporaries, whose conclusions have been adopted by       Brugsch.         ^ Sutikhu, Sutkhu, are lengthened forms of Sutu, or Situ;       and Chabas, who had at first denied the existence of the       final _Jehu_, afterwards himself supplied the philological       arguments which proved the correctness of the reading: he       rightly refused, however, to recognise in Sutikhu or Sutkhu       --the name of the conquerors' god--a transliteration of the       Phoenician Sydyk, and would only see in it that of the       nearest Egyptian deity. This view is now accepted as the       right one, and Sutkhu is regarded as the indigenous       equivalent of the great Asiatic god, elsewhere called Baal,       or supreme lord. [Professor Petrie found a scarab bearing       the cartouche of \"Sutekh\" Apepi I. at Koptos.--Te.]    He was usually represented as a fully armed warrior, wearing a helmet  of circular form, ornamented with two plumes; but he also borrowed  the emblematic animal of Sit, the fennec, and the winged griffin which  haunted the deserts of the Thebaid. His temples were erected in the  cities of the Delta, side by side with the sanctuaries of the feudal  gods, both at Bubastis and at Tanis. Tanis, now made the capital,  reopened its palaces, and acquired a fresh impetus from the royal  presence within its walls. Apophis Aq-nunri, one of its kings, dedicated  several tables of offerings in that city, and engraved his cartouches  upon the sphinxes and standing colossi of the Pharaohs of the XIIth and  XIIIth dynasties.    [Illustration: 082.jpg TABLE OF OFFERINGS BEARING THE NAME OF APOTI  AQNUNRI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by E. Brugsch.    [Illustration: 083.jpg Page Image]    He was, however, honest enough to leave the inscriptions of his  predecessors intact, and not to appropriate to himself the credit of  works belonging to the Amenemhaits or to Mirmashau. Khiani, who is  possibly the Iannas of Manetho, was not, however, so easily satisfied.*  The statue bearing his inscription, of which the lower part was  discovered by Naville at Bubastis, appears to have been really carved  for himself or for one of his contemporaries. It is a work possessing no  originality, though of very commendable execution, such as would render  it acceptable to any museum; the artist who conceived it took 'his  inspiration with considerable cleverness from the best examples  turned out by the schools of the Delta under the Sovkhotpfts and the  Nofirhotpus. But a small grey granite lion, also of the reign of Khiani,  which by a strange fate had found its way to Bagdad, does not raise our  estimation of the modelling of animals in the Hyksos period.         * Naville, who reads the name Rayan or Yanra, thinks that       this prince must be the Annas or Iannas mentioned by Manetho       as being one of the six shepherd-kings of the XVth dynasty.       Mr. Petrie proposed to read Khian, Khiani, and the fragment       discovered at Gebelein confirms this reading, as well as a       certain number of cylinders and scarabs. Mr. Petrie prefers       to place this Pharaoh in the VIIIth dynasty, and makes him       one of the leaders in the foreign occupation to which he       supposes Egypt to have submitted at that time; but it is       almost certain that he ought to be placed among the Hyksos       of the XVIth dynasty. The name Khiani, more correctly       Khiyani or Kheyani, is connected by Tomkins, and Hilprecht       with that of a certain Khayanu or Khayan, son of Gabbar, who       reigned in Amanos in the time of Salmanasar II., King of       Assyria.    [Illustration: 084.jpg BROKEN STATUE OF KHIANI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Naville.    It is heavy in form, and the muzzle in no way recalls the fine profile  of the lions executed by the sculptors of earlier times. The pursuit  of science and the culture of learning appear to have been more  successfully perpetuated than the fine arts; a treatise on mathematics,  of which a copy has come down to us, would seem to have been recopied,  if not remodelled, in the twenty-second year of Apophis IL Ausirri. If  we only possessed more monuments or documents treating of this period,  we should doubtless perceive that their sojourn on the banks of the  Nile was instrumental in causing a speedy change in the appearance and  character of the Hyksos. The strangers retained to a certain extent  their coarse countenances and rude manners: they showed no aptitude for  tilling the soil or sowing grain, but delighted in the marshy expanses  of the Delta, where they gave themselves up to a semi-savage life  of hunting and of tending cattle. The nobles among them, clothed and  schooled after the Egyptian fashion, and holding fiefs, or positions at  court, differed but little from the native feudal chiefs. We see here a  case of what generally happens when a horde of barbarians settles down  in a highly organised country which by a stroke of fortune they may have  conquered; as soon as the Hyksos had taken complete possession of Egypt,  Egypt in her turn took possession of them, and those who survived the  enervating effect of her civilization were all but transformed into  Egyptians.    If, in the time of the native Pharaohs, Asiatic tribes had been drawn  towards Egypt, where they were treated as subjects or almost as slaves,  the attraction which she possessed for them must have increased in  intensity under the shepherds. They would now find the country in the  hands of men of the same races as themselves--Egyptianised, it is true,  but not to such an extent as to have completely lost their own language  and the knowledge of their own extraction. Such immigrants were the more  readily welcomed, since there lurked a feeling among the Hyksos that it  was necessary to strengthen themselves against the slumbering hostility  of the indigenous population. The royal palace must have more than once  opened its gates to Asiatic counsellors and favourites. Canaanites and  Bedouin must often have been enlisted for the camp at Avaris. Invasions,  famines, civil wars, all seem to have conspired to drive into Egypt not  only isolated individuals, but whole families and tribes. That of the  Beni-Israel, or Israelites, who entered the country about this time, has  since acquired a unique position in the world's history. They belonged  to that family of Semitic extraction which we know by the monuments  and tradition to have been scattered in ancient times along the western  shores of the Persian Gulf and on the banks of the Euphrates. Those  situated nearest to Chaldaea and to the sea probably led a settled  existence; they cultivated the soil, they employed themselves in  commerce and industries, their vessels--from Dilmun, from Magan, and  from Milukhkha--coasted from one place to another, and made their way to  the cities of Sumer and Accad. They had been civilized from very early  times, and some of their towns were situated on islands, so as to  be protected from sudden incursions. Other tribes of the same family  occupied the interior of the continent; they lived in tents, and  delighted in the unsettled life of nomads. There appeared to be in this  distant corner of Arabia an inexhaustible reserve of population, which  periodically overflowed its borders and spread over the world. It was  from this very region that we see the Kashdim, the true Chaldaeans,  issuing ready armed for combat,--a people whose name was subsequently  used to denote several tribes settled between the lower waters of the  Tigris and the Euphrates. It was there, among the marshes on either side  of these rivers, that the Aramoans established their first settlements  after quitting the desert. There also the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17325"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chald√¶a, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 5 (of 12) (#14)"],[1,"the excavations of Prof. Petrie, the little which he has       brought to light being entirely of Egyptian character. The       temple is represented on the tomb of the high priest Mariri.    [Illustration: 084.jpg Map]    The palace was built of brick; it was approached by a colossal gateway,  and contained vast halls, interspersed with small apartments for the  accommodation of the household, and storehouses for the necessary  provisions, besides gardens which had been hastily planted with rare  shrubs and sycamores. Fragments of furniture and of the roughest of the  utensils contained in the different chambers are still unearthed from  among the heaps of rubbish, and the cellars especially are full of  potsherds and cracked jars, on which we can still see written an  indication of the reign and the year when the wine they once contained  was made. Altars of massive masonry rose in the midst of the courts,  on which the king or one of his ministers heaped offerings and burnt  incense morning, noon, and evening, in honour of the three decisive  moments in the life of Atonu.*         * Naville discovered at Deir el-Bahari a similar altar,       nearly intact. No other example was before known in any of       the ruined towns or temples, and no one had any idea of the       dimensions to which these altars, attained.    A few painted and gilded columns supported the roofs of the principal  apartments in which the Pharaoh held his audiences, but elsewhere the  walls and pillars were coated with cream-coloured stucco or whitewash,  on which scenes of private life were depicted in colours. The pavement,  like the walls, was also decorated. In one of the halls which seems to  have belonged to the harem, there is still to be seen distinctly  the picture of a rectangular piece of water containing fish and  lotus-flowers in full bloom; the edge is adorned with water-plants and  flowering shrubs, among which birds fly and calves graze and gambol; on  the right and left were depicted rows of stands laden with fruit, while  at each end of the room were seen the grinning faces of a gang of negro  and Syrian prisoners, separated from each other by gigantic arches. The  tone of colouring is bright and cheerful, and the animals are treated  with great freedom and facility. The Pharaoh, had collected about him  several of the best artists then to be found at Thebes, placing  them under the direction of Bauki, the chief of the corporation  of sculptors,* and probably others subsequently joined these from  provincial studios.         * Bauki belonged to a family of artists, and his father Mani       had filled before him the post of chief of the sculptors.       The part played by these personages was first defined by       Brugsch, with perhaps some exaggeration of their artistic       merit and originality of talent.    Work for them was not lacking, for houses had to be built for all the  courtiers and government officials who had been obliged to follow the  king, and in a few years a large town had sprung up, which was called  Khuitatonu, or the \"Horizon of the Disk.\" It was built on a regular  plan, with straight streets and open spaces, and divided into two  separate quarters, interspersed with orchards and shady trellises.  Workmen soon began to flock to the new city--metal-founders,  glass-founders, weavers; in fine, all who followed any trade  indispensable to the luxury of a capital. The king appropriated a  territory for it from the ancient nome of the Hare, thus compelling the  god Thot to contribute to the fortune of Atonu; he fixed its limits by  means of stelae placed in the mountains, from Gebel-Tunah to Deshluit on  the west, and from Sheikh-Said to El-Hauata on the eastern bank;* it was  a new nome improvised for the divine _parvenu_.         * We know at present of fourteen of these stelae. A certain       number must still remain to be discovered on both banks of       the Nile.    [Illustration: 082.jpg THE DECORATED PAVEMENT OF THE PALACE]    Atonu was one of the forms of the Sun, and perhaps the most material one  of all those devised by the Egyptians. He was defined as \"the good god  who rejoices in truth, the lord of the solar course, the lord of the  disk, the lord of heaven, the lord of earth, the living disk which  lights up the two worlds, the living Harmakhis who rises on the horizon  bearing his name of Shu, which is disk, the eternal infuser of life.\"  His priests exercised the same functions as those of Heliopolis, and his  high priest was called \"Oirimau,\" like the high priest of Ra in Aunu.  This functionary was a certain Marirl, upon whom the king showered his  favours, and he was for some time the chief authority in the State after  the Pharaoh himself. Atonu was represented sometimes by the ordinary  figure of Horus,* sometimes by the solar disk, but a disk whose rays  were prolonged towards the earth, like so many arms ready to lay  hold with their little hands of the offerings of the faithful, or to  distribute to mortals the _crux ansata_, the symbol of life. The other  gods, except Amon, were sharers with humanity in his benefits. Atonu  proscribed him, and tolerated him only at Thebes; he required, moreover,  that the name of Amon should be effaced wherever it occurred, but he  respected Ra and Horus and Harmakhis--all, in fact, but Amon: he was  content with being regarded as their king, and he strove rather to  become their chief than their destroyer.**         * It was probably this form of Horus which had, in the       temple at Thebes, the statue called \"the red image of Atonu       in Paatoml.\"         ** Prisse d'Avennes has found at Karnak, on fragments of the       temple, the names of other divinities than Atonu worshipped       by Khuniatonu.    His nature, moreover, had nothing in it of the mysterious or ambiguous;  he was the glorious torch which gave light to humanity, and which  was seen every day to flame in the heavens without ever losing its  brilliance or becoming weaker. When he hides himself \"the world rests in  darkness, like those dead who lie in their rock-tombs, with their heads  swathed, their nostrils stuffed up, their eyes sightless, and whose  whole property might be stolen from them, even that which they have  under their head, without their knowing it; the lion issues from his  lair, the serpent roams ready to bite, it is as obscure as in a dark  room, the earth is silent whilst he who creates everything dwells in his  horizon.\" He has hardly arisen when \"Egypt becomes festal, one awakens,  one rises on one's feet; when thou hast caused men to clothe themselves,  they adore thee with outstretched hands, and the whole earth attends  to its work, the animals betake themselves to their herbage, trees  and green crops abound, birds fly to their marshy thickets with wings  outstretched in adoration of thy double, the cattle skip, all the birds  which were in their nests shake themselves when thou risest for them;  the boats come and go, for every way is open at thy appearance, the  fish of the river leap before thee as soon as thy rays descend upon the  ocean.\" It is not without reason that all living things thus rejoice at  his advent; all of them owe their existence to him, for \"he creates the  female germ, he gives virility to men, and furnishes life to the infant  in its mother's womb; he calms and stills its weeping, he nourishes it  in the maternal womb, giving forth the breathings which animate all that  he creates, and when the infant escapes from the womb on the day of  its birth, thou openest his mouth for speech, and thou satisfiest his  necessities. When the chick is in the egg, a cackle in a stone, thou  givest to it air while within to keep it alive; when thou hast caused  it to be developed in the egg to the point of being able to break it, it  goes forth proclaiming its existence by its cackling, and walks on its  feet from the moment of its leaving the egg.\" Atonu presides over the  universe and arranges within it the lot of human beings, both Egyptians  and foreigners. The celestial Nile springs up in Hades far away in the  north; he makes its current run down to earth, and spreads its waters  over the fields during the inundation in order to nourish his creatures.  He rules the seasons, winter and summer; he constructed the far-off sky  in order to display himself therein, and to look down upon his works  below. From the moment that he reveals himself there, \"cities, towns,  tribes, routes, rivers--all eyes are lifted to him, for he is the  disk of the day upon the earth.\"* The sanctuary in which he is invoked  contains only his divine shadow;** for he himself never leaves the  firmament.         * These extracts are taken from the hymns of Tel el-Amarna.         ** In one of the tombs at Tel el-Amarna the king is depicted       leading his mother Tii to the temple of Atonu in order to       see \"the Shadow of Ra,\" and it was thought with some reason       that \"the Shadow of Ra\" was one of the names of the temple.       I think that this designation applied also to the statue or       symbol of the god; the _shadow_ of a god was attached to the       statue in the same manner as the \"double,\" and transformed       it into an animated body.    His worship assumes none of the severe and gloomy forms of the Theban  cults: songs resound therein, and hymns accompanied by the harp or  flute; bread, cakes, vegetables, fruits, and flowers are associated  with his rites, and only on very rare occasions one of those bloody  sacrifices in which the other gods delight. The king made himself  supreme pontiff of Atonu, and took precedence of the high priest. He  himself celebrated the rites at the altar of the god, and we see him  there standing erect, his hands outstretched, offering incense and  invoking blessings from on high.* Like the Caliph Hakim of a later age,  he formed a school to propagate his new doctrines, and preached them"]]]
