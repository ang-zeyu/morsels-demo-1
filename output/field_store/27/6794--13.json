How were we to  carry all our building materials up to this great height? One would  think that the difficulties would be enough to discourage us, but not so  with the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I. Nothing daunted us.      DUTCHY TAKES A DARE.    Our first task was to try some other approach to the top of the cliff.  At one side of the overhanging ledge there was a fissure in the rocks  which ran from the base of the pillar to the foot of the cliff. Down  this zigzag crevice Dutchy had scrambled, one afternoon, on a dare. We  were rather frightened when he started, because it was a very hazardous  undertaking, and we watched him anxiously, peering over the edge of the  precipice. By bracing his back against one of the walls of the rock, and  digging his feet into the niches and chinks of the opposite wall, he  safely made his way to a shelf about half-way down, where he paused to  rest. From that point on the fissure widened out, and a steep, almost  vertical incline, sparsely covered with vegetation, led to the railroad  track below. I think he must have become rather frightened at his  position, because he hesitated long before he resumed his downward  course, and when he finally did make the attempt his foot slipped upon  the moss-covered rocks and down he fell, scratching and clawing at every  shrub within reach. Believing him to be killed, we rushed down the hill  and around to the foot of the cliff. It probably took us about fifteen  or twenty minutes, though it seemed ages before we came upon our  venturesome comrade coolly trying to pin together a rent of inconvenient  location and dimensions in his trousers.    \"Say, Dutchy, are you killed?\" cried Bill, breathlessly.    \"Killed, nothing,\" he replied, with scorn. \"I suppose you fellows think  I had a fall. Well, I didn't.\"    \"You didn't, eh? We saw you slip.\"    \"Oh, go on. I came down that way on purpose. There was no use in picking  my way down like a 'fraid cat, when I could just as well take a smooth  and easy toboggan slide on the bushes all the way down.\"    Smooth and easy toboggan slide! Well, you should have seen the hillside.  The course was well defined by the torn and uprooted shrubs and the pile  of branches and vines at Dutchy's feet. Whether the hare-brained Dutchy  really imagined he could glide easily down on the shrubbery, his frantic  movements on the way certainly belied his story, and when, the next day,  we proposed that he repeat the trick, somehow he didn't seem to be very  enthusiastic on the subject.    [Illustration: Wichita Indians Building a Straw Hut.]      A PATH UP THE FISSURE.    [Illustration: Fig. 133. The Jacob's Ladder.]    It was up this fissure that we decided to haul materials for our tree  hut. Our first task was to build steps and ladders in the steepest  parts. We had no tool for cutting out niches in the rock, but wherever  natural depressions were formed we wedged in sticks of wood between the  side walls to serve as ladder rungs. If no such niches appeared for  considerable height, we would stretch a rope ladder to the next fixed  rung. In most places the natural formation of the rock was such as to  afford sufficient footing.      ROPE LADDERS.    [Illustration: Fig. 134. Rope Ladder.]    The rope ladders were made of two parallel side straps, tightly  stretched between the fixed sticks, and then at intervals of fifteen  inches we inserted the ends of the ladder rung between the strands of  the rope. Below and above each rung the rope was bound with cord. The  rungs were notched at the ends to prevent them from slipping out.    [Illustration: Fig. 135. A Ladder Rung.]    [Illustration: Fig. 136. The Derrick.]    After providing a means for scaling the cliff (we called it the Jacob's  Ladder), we were still confronted with the problem how to cart our  building materials to the top. It was a very hard task and you couldn't  have hired us to do it under any other circumstances. First, Bill  planned out on paper just how the house was to be built, and we cut all  the pieces to the right size so as not to carry up any superfluous  matter. When all was ready the boards and sticks were loaded on the  scow, and ferried over to the cliff. Then we carried them on our backs,  three or four at a time, up the slanting hillside to the first ledge.  From there up, owing to the steepness of the ascent, we had to employ  different tactics.      THE DERRICK.    [Illustration: Fig. 137. The Derrick in Use.]    A derrick was constructed of two sticks 10 feet long, which were bolted  together at the top, and secured about five feet apart at the bottom by  a cross piece, as shown in Fig. 136. The derrick was then taken apart  and with some difficulty hauled piecemeal up to the next ledge above.  Here it was put together again. The fall and tackle used in our aerial  railway was attached to the apex of the derrick, and the latter was then  erected with the legs set into depressions in the ledge and the upper  ends slanting outward but kept from falling over the edge by a rope tied  to one of the fixed rungs set in the fissure. With this derrick we  hoisted up the boards in a few hauls. The job was a very ticklish one,  but Bill used the greatest care to prevent accident. The derrick, rope  and tackle were carefully tested before used, and as soon as the load  was attached to the lower pulley block the two who did the loading were  instructed to crawl back into the fissure so as to be out of danger in  case anything gave way. At one time a stick which had been carelessly  tied did fall, and it might have badly hurt some one had we not observed  this precaution. When we had raised the material to the second ledge we  transferred operations to the top ledge, and when the materials had been  hauled up to this point we finally rigged up our fall and tackle in the  old oak tree itself.      THE TREE HOUSE.    [Illustration: Fig. 138. Main Girder of the Tree House.]    [Illustration: Fig 139. Top View of the Platform.]    The tree had two large limbs which extended out at a wide angle from the  main trunk. Across these two limbs, at about seven feet out, we laid our  first girder, nailing it securely in place. Then to the main trunk we  nailed the second girder on a level with the first. Diagonal braces were  extended from the trunk to support the ends of this girder, and a tie  piece was nailed to the braces, as shown in Fig. 138, to prevent them  from spreading. The girders were rough sticks about 4 inches in diameter  and 10 feet long. We cut flat faces on them at the points where they  were nailed to the tree, and then, to make them doubly secured, we  nailed cleats, or blocks of wood, to the tree under them. The floor  beams were then laid across and nailed to the girders. They were cut to  a length of 10 feet so as to project beyond the outer girder to provide  for a piazza overhanging the Goblins' Platform. Six floor beams were  used, spaced 20 inches apart. All branches projecting up between the  beams were then cut away and a flooring of slabs was laid on. To the  main trunk six feet above the flooring, a stick or (to use the technical  term), \"wall plate,\" was nailed on, and its ends were supported by  upright posts resting on the platform. Thirty inches from the outer end  of the platform two more posts were erected eight feet high and secured  by sticks nailed across from the other posts, and also by a second wall  plate connecting their upper ends. Four more posts were erected, one  between each pair of the corner posts, and then we were ready to enclose  the framing.    [Illustration: Fig. 140. The Frame of the House.]    [Illustration: Fig. 141. Nailing on the Clapboards.]    The sidewalls were first clapboarded, because we were afraid the roof  would not hold us until the framing had been strengthened by nailing on  the siding. Slab boards were used for this purpose. Beginning at the  bottom, the boards were laid on, each lapping over the one below, as  shown in Fig. 141, so as to shed water. In each side we cut a window  opening and nailed on a window casing of the type shown in Fig. 142,  which will be described in a moment. As soon as the clapboards were  applied, we nailed on the rafters and then applied the roofing. The same  principle was here used for shedding water. The lowest board was first  laid on, and then the others were successively applied, each lapping  over the one below.    [Illustration: Fig. 142. The Window Casing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 143. The Window Sash.]    The window casings we used each consisted of a frame about 15 inches  square, but with the upper and lower pieces extending 12 inches beyond  one of the side pieces. On these extended pieces a slideway was formed  for the window sash by nailing on two strips of wood about 3/4 inch  square and over them a pair of wider strips projecting inward, so as to  overlap the edges of the sash. The window sash consisted of a frame  13-1/2 inches square, made of 3/4-inch square strips over which canvas  was tightly stretched and tacked. A spool was nailed on at one side for  a handle. These windows were closed only in rainy weather, to keep the  water out.      SLIDING DOORS.    [Illustration: Fig. 144. Section of the Door and Frame.]    We had two doors; one at the back of the house, from which a ladder  extended down to the ground, and another opening out onto the veranda,  from which we dropped a ladder down to the Goblins' Dancing Platform. In  order to save space we used sliding instead of swinging doors. The back  door frame was 5-1/2 feet high and the front door frame 6 feet high. The  doors were mounted on the outside of the building. The side posts of  each frame were 2-1/2 feet apart, and the lintel and sill extended 3  feet beyond the side post at one side. The upper face of the lintel was  planed down perfectly smooth, and its edges were tapered off to make a  track for the rollers on the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],[0,"The Rebel of the School (#14)"],[1,"attic to  thumb over his well-worn lesson-books he had Kathleen's golden sovereign  in his pocket. He took it out and looked at it; he turned it round and  round and examined it all over. He rubbed it lovingly against his  freckled cheek, held it until it got warm in the palm of his hand, and  then put it back in his pocket and jingled it against a couple of  pennies which were its only companions.    \"A whole sovereign,\" he said to himself--\"a whole sovereign, and I never  had so much as five shillings of my own in the whole course of my life.  Well, she is a little witch. I suppose Dave would beat me black and blue  for doing a thing of this sort. But how could I--how could I withstand  her?\"    Supper at the Tennants' generally consisted of cold pudding, cold meat,  bread-and-butter, and a little jam when there happened to be any in the  house. It was not a particularly tempting meal, and those who ate it  required to have good, vigorous appetites. Kathleen, although she had  been brought up in a considerable amount of wasteful splendor, was  indifferent to what she ate. She soon jumped up and walked across the  little passage into the drawing-room. Ben, looking very red and  shamefaced, would not meet her eyes. Ben's face annoyed Kathleen. It did  not occur to her for a minute that he would not be faithful to her, but  she was afraid that others might notice his extraordinary and perturbed  expression. Once, too, he jingled the sovereign in his pocket; she heard  him, and wondered why David did not ask him where he had got the money.  But no remark was made, and the meal came safely to an end. Kathleen  took up the first book she could find and pretended to read.    \"I shall feign sleepiness at a quarter to nine,\" she said to herself,  \"and go upstairs. I shall be awfully polite and sweet to dear Alice. She  never comes to bed before ten, so I shall be quite safe getting out of  the house. I can drop from the window, but I should prefer going by the  back door; and I don't think Maria will betray me.\"    Just then Alice strolled into the room. She looked rather nice; she wore  a very pretty pink muslin blouse, which suited her well. Her hair was  neatly arranged; her face was calm. She stood before Kathleen.    \"I wish--\" she said suddenly.    Kathleen raised her head.    \"And I wish you wouldn't stand between me and the lamp. Don't you see  that I am reading?\"    \"I want you to stop reading. I have something to say.\"    \"Indeed!\"    Kathleen longed to be very rude, but she thought of her delightful plan  so close at hand, and refrained.    \"I must humor her if I can by any possibility keep my temper,\" was her  thought. Then aloud: \"What is it you want? I hope you will be very  quick, for I am rather sleepy and intend to go to bed soon.\"    \"I hope you won't do it again, that's all.\"    \"Do what again?\" asked Kathleen.    \"Spend your money on buying food for us. We are not so poor as all that.  My mother is paid by your father to give you your meals; your father  doesn't expect you to buy them over again.\"    \"Dad always likes me to do what I wish,\" replied Kathleen calmly.    \"Well, don't do it again. It's extremely displeasing both to David and  me.\"    Kathleen laughed.    \"Dave gobbled up his sausage and his sardines,\" she said.    \"Don't do it again, that's all.\"    Kathleen nodded her head, and again buried herself in her book.    \"And there is another thing,\" continued Alice, dropping into a chair by  Kathleen's side. \"You are very low down in the school. Two of the  mistresses spoke to me about you to-day. They don't like to see a great  overgrown girl like you in a class with little children; it does neither  you nor the school credit. They fear that during this term you may be  forced to continue in your present low position; but they earnestly hope  that you will work very hard, so as to be removed into a higher form.  You ought, after Christmas, to get into a class at least two removes  higher up in the school. That is what I came to say. I suppose you have  a certain sense of honor, and you don't want your father's money to be  thrown away.\"    \"Bedad, then! he has plenty of money, and I don't much care,\" replied  Kathleen.    She lay back in her chair and whistled \"Garry Owen\" in a most insolent  manner.    \"If you have really made up your mind not to improve yourself in the  very least, mother had better write to Squire O'Hara and suggest that  you don't come back after Christmas.\"    \"And Squire O'Hara will decide that point for himself,\" replied  Kathleen. \"There are other houses where I can be entertained and fussed  over, and regarded as I ought to be regarded, besides the home of Alice  Tennant. The fact is this, Alice: you aggravate me; you don't understand  me; I am at my worst in your presence. Perhaps I am a bit wild  sometimes, but your way would never drive me to work or anything else. I  have no real dislike to learning, and if another girl spoke to me as you  have done I might be very glad.\"    \"What do you mean?\" said poor Alice. \"I really and truly, Kathleen, do  want to help you. You and I could work every evening together; I could,  and would, see you through your lessons. Thus you would very quickly get  to the head of your class, and get your removes without trouble at  Christmas.\"    \"I suppose you mean to be kind,\" said Kathleen. \"I will think it over.  Let me alone now.\"    She gave a portentous yawn. Ben heard her, came and sat down on an  ottoman not far off, and began kicking his legs.    \"Benny,\" said his sister, \"if you have done your lessons, you had better  go to bed.\"    \"I don't want to go so early. You always treat me as if I were a baby.\"    \"Well, please yourself. I am going upstairs to fetch my books. I have a  good hour and a half of hard work to get through before bedtime.\"    The moment Kathleen and Ben were alone, Ben rushed up to her side and  began to whisper.    \"It is all as right as possible,\" he said. \"I am going up to bed as  usual, and when mother and Alice and Dave are safe in their rooms I'll  slip down again. I'll be in the hall. Don't ring when you come back;  just walk up the steps and scratch against the door with your knuckles,  and I'll hear you and let you in in a trice. I am awfully pleased about  that sovereign; it will make me one of the greatest toffs in the school.  I'll have more money than any of the other fellows. I'm so excited I can  scarcely think of anything else. I know I'm doing wrong, but you did  offer me such a tremendous temptation. Now I hear Alice's step. It will  be all right, Kathleen; don't you fear.\"    Kathleen smiled to herself. The rest of her programme was carried out to  a nicety. At a quarter to nine she complained of fatigue, bade Mrs.  Tennant an affectionate good-night, nodded to Alice, and left the room.    \"Be sure you don't lock the door,\" called Alice after her. \"I sha'n't be  up for quite an hour, and you will be sound asleep by that time.\"    \"I won't lock it,\" replied Kathleen gently.    When Kathleen had gone upstairs, Mrs. Tennant turned and spoke to her  daughter.    \"You know, Alice,\" she said, \"the child is very lovable and  kind-hearted--a little barbarian in some senses of the word, but a fine  nature--of that I am certain.\"    \"I am so busy to-night, mother,\" replied Alice. \"Can't we defer talking  of the charms of Kathleen's character until after I have done my  lessons?\"    \"Of course, dear,\" said her mother.    She drew her basket of mending towards her, put stitch after stitch  into the shabby garments, and thought all the time of Kathleen with her  bright face and beautiful, merry eyes.    Meanwhile that young lady, having arranged a bolster in her bed to look  as like a human being as possible, put on her hat and jacket and ran  downstairs. There was no one in the hall, and she was absolutely daring  enough to go out by that door. Mrs. Tennant raised her head when she  heard the door gently shut.    \"Can that be the post?\" she said; but as no one replied, she forgot the  circumstance and went on with her mending.    A few doors down the street Susy Hopkins was waiting for Kathleen.    \"Oh, there you are!\" she said. \"We are so excited! There will be about  eight of us waiting for you in the old quarry. You are good to come. You  don't know what this means in our lives. You are good--you are  wonderfully good.\"    \"Where's the quarry?\" asked Kathleen. \"You have chosen such a funny  place. I should not have imagined that a quarry--a dear, romantic  quarry--could be found anywhere in this neighborhood.\"    \"Yes, but there is, and a good big one, too. It is about half a mile  away, just at the back of Colliers' Buildings. It is the safest place  you can possibly imagine, for no one will ever look for us there. Now do  be quick; we will find the others before us. You can't think how excited  we are.\"    \"Oh, I'm willing to be quick,\" replied Kathleen. \"I am doing all this  for you, you know, because I am sorry for the foundationers, and think  it so very ridiculous that there should be distinctions made. Why, you  are quite as good as the others. They are none of them much to boast  of.\"    \"What fun this is!\" cried Susy again. \"I assure you the paying girls  think no end of themselves. They are under the supposition that there  never were such fine ladies to be found in the land before. Oh, we will  take it out of them, sha'n't we?\"    Kathleen made no reply. Presently they reached the opening that led into  the quarry. They had to go down a narrow sloping path, and then by a  doorway cut in the solid rock. After they had passed through they found  themselves in a large circular cavern open to the sky. There was no moon  and the night was dark; but one girl had brought a lantern. She opened  it and placed it on the ground; a bright shaft of light now fell on  several young figures all huddled together. Susy gave a sharp whistle;  the girls started to their feet.    \"Here we are,"]]]
