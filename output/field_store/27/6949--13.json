(#14)"],[1," of action, nor stimulated by any violent ambition,  earnestly sought for means of restoring tranquillity to his people,  disgusted with a war, which, being joined with the plague and fire, had  proved so fruitless and destructive.    The first advances towards an accommodation were made by England. When  the king sent for the body of Sir William Berkeley, he insinuated to  the states his desire of peace on reasonable terms; and their answer  corresponded in the same amicable intentions. Charles, however, to  maintain the appearance of superiority, still insisted that the states  should treat at London; and they agreed to make him this compliment  so far as concerned themselves: but being engaged in alliance with two  crowned heads, they could not, they said, prevail with these to depart  in that respect from their dignity. On a sudden, the king went so far on  the other side as to offer the sending of ambassadors to the Hague; but  this proposal, which seemed honorable to the Dutch, was meant only to  divide and distract them, by affording the English an opportunity to  carry on cabals with the disaffected party. The offer was therefore  rejected; and conferences were secretly held in the queen mother's  apartments at Paris, where the pretensions of both parties were  discussed. The Dutch made equitable proposals; either that all things  should be restored to the same condition in which they stood before the  war, or that both parties should continue in possession of their present  acquisitions. Charles accepted of the latter proposal; and almost every  thing was adjusted, except the disputes with regard to the Isle of  Polerone. This island lies in the East Indies, and was formerly valuable  for its produce of spices. The English had been masters of it, but were  dispossessed at the time when the violences were committed against  them at Amboyna. Cromwell had stipulated to have it restored; and  the Hollanders, having first entirely destroyed all the spice trees,  maintained that they had executed the treaty, but that the English had  been anew expelled during the course of the war. Charles renewed his  pretensions to this island; and as the reasons on both sides began to  multiply, and seemed to require a long discussion, it was agreed to  transfer the treaty to some other place; and Charles made choice of  Breda.    Lord Hollis and Henry Coventry were the English ambassadors. They  immediately desired that a suspension of arms should be agreed to, till  the several claims should be adjusted; but this proposal, seemingly  so natural, was rejected by the credit of De Wit. That penetrating and  active minister, thoroughly acquainted with the characters of princes  and the situation of affairs, had discovered an opportunity of striking  a blow, which might at once restore to the Dutch the honor lost during  the war, and severely revenge those injuries which he ascribed to the  wanton ambition and injustice of the English.    Whatever projects might have been formed by Charles for secreting  the money granted him by parliament, he had hitherto failed in his  intention. The expenses of such vast armaments had exhausted all the  supplies,[*] and even a great debt was contracted to the seamen. The  king, therefore, was resolved to save, as far as possible, the last  supply of one million eight hundred thousand pounds; and to employ it  for payment of his debts, as well those which had been occasioned by the  war, as those which he had formerly contracted. He observed, that the  Dutch had been with great reluctance forced into the war, and that the  events of it were not such as to inspire them with great desire of its  continuance. The French, he knew, had been engaged into hostilities by  no other motive than that of supporting their ally; and were now more  desirous than ever of putting an end to the quarrel. The differences  between the parties were so inconsiderable, that the conclusion of peace  appeared infallible; and nothing but forms, at least some vain points of  honor, seemed to remain for the ambassadors at Breda to discuss. In  this situation, Charles, moved by an ill-timed frugality, remitted his  preparations, and exposed England to one of the greatest affronts which  it has ever received. Two small squadrons alone were equipped, and  during a war with such potent and martial enemies, every thing was  left almost in the same situation as in times of the most profound  tranquillity.         * The Dutch had spent on the war near forty millions of       livres a year, about three millions sterling; a much greater       sum than had been granted by the English parliament.       D'Estrades, December 24 1665. January 1, 1666. Temple, vol.       i. p. 71. It was probably the want of money which engaged       the king to pay the seamen with tickets; a contrivance which       proved so much to their loss.    De Wit protracted the negotiations at Breda, and hastened the naval  preparations. The Dutch fleet appeared in the Thames, under the command  of De Ruyter, and threw the English into the utmost consternation. A  chain had been drawn across the River Medway; some fortifications had  been added to Sheerness and Upnore Castle; but all these preparations  were unequal to the present necessity. Sheerness was soon taken; nor  could it be saved by the valor of Sir Edward Sprague, who defended it.  Having the advantage of a spring tide and an easterly wind, the Dutch  pressed on, and broke the chain, though fortified by some ships, which  had been there sunk by orders of the duke of Albemarle. They burned the  three ships which lay to guard the chain--the Matthias, the Unity, and  the Charles V. After damaging several vessels, and possessing themselves  of the hull of the Royal Charles, which the English had burned, they  advanced with six men-of-war and five fireships as far as Upnore Castle,  where they burned the Royal Oak, the Loyal London, and the Great James.  Captain Douglas, who commanded on board the Royal Oak, perished in the  flames, though he had an easy opportunity of escaping. \"Never was it  known,\" he said, \"that a Douglas had left his post without orders.\"[*]  The Hollanders fell down the Medway without receiving any considerable  damage; and it was apprehended, that they might next tide sail up the  Thames, and extend their hostilities even to the bridge of London. Nine  ships were sunk at Woolwich, four at Blackwall: platforms were raised in  many places, furnished with artillery; the train bands were called out,  and every place was in a violent agitation. The Dutch sailed next to  Portsmouth, where they made a fruitless attempt: they met with no better  success at Plymouth: they insulted Harwich: they sailed again up the  Thames as far as Tilbury, where they were repulsed. The whole coast was  in alarm; and had the French thought proper at this time to join the  Dutch fleet, and to invade England, consequences the most fatal might  justly have been apprehended. But Lewis had no intention to push the  victory to such extremities. His interest required that a balance  should be kept between the two maritime powers; not that an uncontrolled  superiority should be given to either.         * Temple, vol. ii. p. 41.    Great indignation prevailed amongst the English, to see an enemy, whom  they regarded as inferior, whom they had expected totally to subdue,  and over whom they had gained many honorable advantages, now of a sudden  ride undisputed masters of the ocean, burn their ships in their very  harbors, fill every place with confusion, and strike a terror into the  capital itself. But though the cause of all these disasters could be  ascribed neither to bad fortune, to the misconduct of admirals, nor to  the ill behavior of seamen, but solely to the avarice, at least to the  improvidence, of the government, no dangerous symptoms of discontent  appeared, and no attempt for an insurrection was made by any of those  numerous sectaries who had been so openly branded for their rebellious  principles, and who, upon that supposition, had been treated with such  severity.[*]         * Some nonconformists, however, both in Scotland and       England, had kept a correspondence with the states, and had       entertained projects for insurrections; but they were too       weak even to attempt the execution of them. D'Estrades,       October 13, 1665.    In the present distress, two expedients were embraced: an army of twelve  thousand men was suddenly levied; and the parliament, though it lay  under prorogation, was summoned to meet. The houses were very thin; and  the only vote which the commons passed, was an address for breaking the  army; which was complied with. This expression of jealousy showed the  court what they might expect from that assembly; and it was thought more  prudent to prorogue them till next winter.    But the signing of the treaty at Breda extricated the king from his  present difficulties. The English ambassadors received orders to recede  from those demands, which, how ever frivolous in themselves, could not  now be relinquished without acknowledging a superiority in the enemy.  Polerone remained with the Dutch; satisfaction for the ships Bonaventure  and Good Hope, the pretended grounds of the quarrel, was no longer  insisted on; Acadie was yielded to the French. The acquisition of  New York, a settlement so important by its situation, was the chief  advantage which the English reaped from a war, in which the national  character of bravery had shone out with lustre, but where the misconduct  of the government, especially in the conclusion, had been no less  apparent.    To appease the people by some sacrifice seemed requisite before the  meeting of parliament; and the prejudices of the nation pointed out the  victim. The chancellor was at this time much exposed to the hatred  of the public, and of every party which divided the nation. All the  numerous sectaries regarded him as "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#14)"],[1,"FOR REFORMING CHURCH DISCIPLINE.    All the clamour that was raised against the king could not divert him  from prosecuting the scheme of comprehension. He granted a commission  under the great seal to ten bishops and twenty dignitaries of the  church, authorizing them to meet from time to time in the Jerusalem  chamber, to prepare such alterations of the liturgy and the canons, and  such proposals for the reformation of ecclesiastical courts as might  most conduce to the good order, edification, and uniting of the church,  and tend to reconcile all religious differences among the protestant  subjects of the kingdom. A cry was immediately raised against this  commission, as an ecclesiastical court illegal and dangerous. At their  first meeting the authority of the commission was questioned by Sprat,  bishop of Rochester, who retired in disgust, and was followed by Mew of  Winchester, and the doctors Jane and Aldrich. These were averse to any  alteration of the forms and constitution of the church in favour of an  insolent and obstinate party, which ought to have been satisfied with  the toleration they enjoyed. They observed that an attempt to make such  alteration would divide the clergy, and bring the liturgy into disesteem  with the people, as it would be a plain acknowledgment that it wanted  correction. They thought they should violate the dignity of the church  by condescending to make offers which the dissenters were at liberty to  refuse; and they suspected some of their colleagues of a design to give  up episcopal ordination--a step inconsistent with their honour, duty,  oaths, and subscriptions.          MEETING OF THE CONVOCATION.    The commissioners, notwithstanding this secession, proceeded to debate  with moderation on the abuses of which the dissenters had complained,  and corrected every article that seemed liable to any just objection;  but the opposite party employed all their art and industry to inflame  the minds of the people. The two universities declared against all  alterations, and those who promoted them. The king himself was  branded as an enemy to the hierarchy; and they bestirred themselves so  successfully in the election of members for the convocation, that  they procured a very considerable majority. At their first meeting the  friends of the comprehension scheme proposed Dr. Tillotson, clerk of the  closet to his majesty, as prolocutor; but the other party carried it in  favour of Dr. Jane, who was counted the most violent churchman in the  whole Assembly. In a Latin speech to the bishop of London as president,  he, in the name of the lower house, asserted that the liturgy of England  needed no amendment, and concluded with the old declaration of the  barons, \"_Nolumus leges Angliae mutari_. We will not suffer the laws  of England to be changed.\" The bishop, in his reply, exhorted them  to moderation, charity, and indulgence towards their brethren the  dissenters, and to make such abatements in things indifferent as might  serve to open a door of salvation to multitudes of straying christians.  His injunctions, however, produced no favourable effect; the lower house  seemed to be animated by a spirit of opposition. Next day the president  prorogued them, on pretence that the royal commission, by which  they were to act, was defective for want of being sealed, and that a  prorogation was necessary until that sanction should be obtained. In  this interval means were used to mollify their non-compliant tempers,  but all endeavours proved ineffectual. When they met again, the earl of  Nottingham delivered the king's commission to both houses, with a  speech of his own, and a message from his majesty, importing that he had  summoned them out of a pious zeal to do every thing that might tend to  the best establishment of the church of England, which should always  enjoy his favour and protection. He exhorted them to lay aside all  prejudice, and consider calmly and impartially whatever should be  proposed: he assured them he would offer nothing but what should be for  the honour, peace, and advantage of the protestant religion in general,  and particularly of the church of England.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          THEIR SESSION PROROGUED.    The bishops adjourning to the Jerusalem chamber, prepared a zealous  address of thanks to his majesty, which, being sent to the lower house  for their concurrence, met with violent opposition. Amendments were  proposed; a conference ensued, and, after warm debates, they agreed upon  a cold address, which was accordingly presented. The majority of the  lower house, far from taking any measures in favour of dissenters,  converted all their attention to the relief of their nonjuring brethren.  Zealous speeches were made in behalf of the suspended bishops; and Dr.  Jane proposed that something might be done to qualify them to sit in the  convocation. This, however, was such a dangerous point as they would not  venture to discuss; yet, rather than proceed upon the business for which  they had been assembled, they began to take cognizance of some pamphlets  lately published, which they conceived to be of dangerous consequence  to the christian religion. The president and his party, perceiving  the disposition of the house, did not think proper to communicate any  proposal touching the intended reformation, and the king suffered the  session to be discontinued by repeated prorogations.          PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT.    The parliament meeting on the nineteenth day of October, the king, in a  speech of his own composing, explained the necessity of a present supply  to carry on the war. He desired that they might be speedy in their  determinations on this subject, for these would in a great measure  influence the deliberations of the princes and states concerned in the  war against France, as a general meeting of them was appointed to be  held next month at the Hague, to settle the operations of the ensuing  campaign. He concluded with recommending the dispatch of a bill of  indemnity, that the minds of his subjects might be quieted, and that  they might unanimously concur in promoting the honour and welfare of the  kingdom. As several inflammatory bills and disputes, which had produced  heats and animosities in the last session, were still depending, the  king, after having consulted both houses, resolved to put an end to  those disputes by a prorogation. He accordingly went to the house of  lords and prorogued the parliament till the twenty-first day of October,  by the mouth of the new speaker, sir Robert Atkins; the marquis of  Halifax having resigned that office. When they re-assembled, the  king referred them to his former speech: then the commons unanimously  resolved to assist his majesty in reducing Ireland, and in joining with  his allies abroad for a vigorous prosecution of the war against France:  for these purposes they voted a supply of two millions.          THE WHIGS OBSTRUCT THE INDEMNITY BILL.    During this session the whigs employed all their influence and intrigues  in obstructing the bill of indemnity, which they knew would open a door  for favour and preferment to the opposite party, which began to gain  ground in the king's good graces. With this view they revived the  prosecution of the state prisoners. A committee was appointed to prepare  a charge against Burton and Graham. The commons resolved to impeach the  earls of Peterborough, Salisbury, and Castlemain, sir Edward Hales,  and Obadiah Walker, of high treason, for having been reconciled to the  church of Rome, contrary to the laws of the realm. A bill was ordered  to be brought in to declare the estate of the late lord chancellor  Jefferies forfeited to the crown, and attaint his blood; but it met with  such opposition that the measure was dropped: the house however agreed,  that the pecuniary penalties incurred by those persons who had exercised  offices contrary to the laws against popish recusants, should be  speedily levied and applied to the public service. The lord Griffin  being detected in maintaining a correspondence with king James and his  partizans, was committed to the Tower; but as no other evidence appeared  against him than written letters, found in the false bottom of a pewter  bottle, they could not help consenting to his being released upon bail,  as they had lately resolved that Algernon Sidney was unjustly condemned  in the reign of Charles II. because nothing but writings had been  produced against him at his trial. The two houses concurred in  appointing a committee to inquire who were the advisers and prosecutors  in taking away the lives of lord Russel, colonel Sydney, sir Thomas  Armstrong, alderman Cornish, and others; and who were chiefly concerned  in the arbitrary practices touching the writs of _quo warranto_, and  the surrender of charters. This inquiry was levelled at the marquis of  Halifax, who had concurred with the ministry of Charles in all these  severities. Though no proof appeared upon which votes or addresses could  be founded, that nobleman saw it was necessary for him to withdraw  himself from the administration; he therefore resigned the privy-seal,  which was put in commission, and reconciled himself to the tories, of  whom he became the patron and protector.          INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSE OF THE MISCARRIAGES IN IRELAND RESUMED.    The commons likewise resumed the examination of the miscarriages in  Ireland, and desired the king would appoint commissioners to go over  and inquire into the condition of the army in that kingdom. Schomberg,  understanding that he had been blamed in the house of commons for his  inactivity, transmitted to the king a satisfactory vindication of his  own conduct; and it appeared that the miscarriages in Ireland were  wholly owing to John Shales, purveyor-general to the army. The commons  immediately presented an address to his majesty, praying that Shales  might be taken into"]]]
