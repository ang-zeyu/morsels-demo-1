Baha'u'llah in quoting this passage seeks to  refute the argument of the Muslims, who attach a purely literal  interpretation to this verse of the Qur'an, and therefore consider it as  implying bodily resurrection. To these Muslims, He says, that you who  literally believe that the human body will return to dust and will be  raised from it again, and therefore attach so much importance to this  mortal world, how then can you wax so proud, and boast over things which  are but perishable and consequently void of any true and lasting value.\"            175: RINGSTONES AND BURIAL STONES      \"In regard to the use of ringstones and burial stones, the Guardian leaves  this matter at present entirely to the discretion of the believers, and  has no objection if your Assembly provides facilities for their purchase  by the friends. When the Kitab-i-Aqdas is published the necessary  instructions will be given regarding this matter.\"            176: SUMMER SCHOOLS, BAHA'I (IMPORTANCE OF)      \"He fervently hopes that through the earnest and sustained efforts of your  committee these annual gatherings will acquire increasing importance in  the eyes of the public, and will constitute an effective medium for the  dissemination of the Teachings. He feels that in your next summer meetings  continued emphasis should be laid upon the teaching of the Administration,  especially in its relation to the outside world, so as to impress the  non-Baha'i attendants at the school with the nature, character, and  world-significance of the World Order of Baha'u'llah.\"            177: SUMMER SCHOOLS, BAHA'I (PURPOSE OF)      \"The basic purpose of all Baha'i Summer Schools, whether in East or West,  is to give the believers the opportunity to acquaint themselves, not only  by mere study but through whole-hearted and active collaboration in  various Baha'i activities with the essentials of the administration and in  this way enable them to become efficient and able promoters of the Cause.  The teaching of the Administration is therefore, an indispensable feature  of every Baha'i Summer School and its special significance can be better  understood if we realize the great need of every believer today for a more  adequate understanding of the social principles and laws of the Faith.\"    \"How wonderful it would be if all the friends could arrange to spend at  least a few days in one of these summer schools and take an active part in  their development. These centers could attract many souls if properly  arranged and made interesting; those non-Baha'is who visit them will then  have some time to get into the spirit of the place and make a study of the  Cause... We constantly receive letters from people who became Baha'i by  visiting one of these centers and obtaining the Message there.\"            178: SERVICE TO HUMANITY      \"He feels that, although your desire to partake actively of the dangers  and miseries afflicting so many millions of people today, is natural, and  a noble impulse, there can be no comparison between the value of Baha'i  work and any other form of service to humanity.    \"If the Baha'is could evaluate their work properly they would see that  whereas other forms of relief work are superficial in character,  alleviating the sufferings and ills of men for a short time at best, the  work they are doing is to lay the foundation of a new Spiritual Order in  the world founded on the Word of God, operating according to the Laws He  has laid down for this age. No one else can do this work except those who  have fully realized the meaning of the Message of Baha'u'llah, where as  almost any courageous, sincere person can engage in relief work, etc.    \"The believers are building a refuge for mankind. This is their supreme,  sacred task and they should devote every moment they can to this task.\"            179: SEVEN LIGHTS OF UNITY      \"The seven lights of Unity will not necessarily come in the order given. A  product of the second may well be universal culture.\"            180: SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE FAITH (A SINGLE DIVINE AND WORLD-EMBRACING  SYSTEM)      \"Concerning the idea of the Baha'i World Order and the proper emphasis  which should be laid on the social aspect of the Faith; the Guardian feels  the necessity for all teachers to stress the fact that the World Order of  Baha'u'llah can, under no circumstances, be divorced from the spiritual  principles and teachings of the Cause; that the social laws and  institutions of the Faith are inseparably bound up and closely interwoven  with the moral and spiritual principles enunciated by Baha'u'llah, Who,  Himself, indeed, has time and again emphasized the underlying oneness and  the identity of purpose of all His spiritual, doctrinal, and social  teachings. The Friends, while emphasizing both of these aspects, should,  in particular, point out that they constitute parts of one and the same  plan, and elements of a single, divine and world-embracing system.\"            181: SPIRITUALITY (THE TROUBLES OF THIS WORLD PASS)      \"As we suffer these misfortunes we must remember that the Prophets of God  Themselves were not immune from these things which men suffer. They knew  sorrow, illness and pain too. They rose above these things through Their  spirits, and that is what we must try and do too, when afflicted. The  troubles of this world pass, and what we have left is what we have made of  our souls; so it is to this we must look--to becoming more spiritual,  drawing nearer to God, no matter what our human minds and bodies go  through.\"            182: SUMMER SCHOOLS (THE BAHA'I)      \"Definite courses should be given along the different phases of the Baha'i  Faith and in a manner that will stimulate the students to proceed in their  studies privately once they return home, for the period of a few days is  not sufficient to learn everything. They have to be taught the habit of  studying the Cause constantly, for the more we read the Words the more  will the truth they contain be revealed to us.\"            183: SUMMER SCHOOLS (BAHA'I ATMOSPHERE IN)      \"He (the Guardian) thinks the less time spent on such topics as 'Current  Events in the light of the Baha'i Faith', and 'The Baha'i Faith and Modern  Science' the better. There is no harm in having an evening lecture by a  qualified speaker once on each of these subjects, but he certainly does  not feel that much time should be spent on them, for the very simple  reason that there is so little that can be said on the subject.\"    \"The Baha'is must realize that they belong to a world-wide Order, and not  an American civilization. They must try and introduce the Baha'i  atmosphere of life and thought into their Summer Schools, rather than  making the Summer School an episode and a pleasant vacation period, during  which they learn a little more about the Faith.\"            184: SUPREME TRIBUNAL      \"The Supreme Tribunal is an aspect of a world Superstate; the exact nature  of its relationship to that state we cannot at present foresee. Supreme  Tribunal is the correct translation; it will be a contributing factor in  establishing the Lesser Peace. There is no statement in the teachings  indicating that the Lesser Peace will definitely be established by 1957 or  1963.\"            185: TABLETS OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA      \"The work of collecting and publishing the Tablets is one of the most  important tasks that this generation has to undertake for upon it depends  our true understanding of the Cause and its principles. Only Tablets with  the Master's signature and in the original tongue should be recognised.  Any translation or copies of them fail having real authority. This shows  the importance of collecting the original Tablets that bear the Master's  signature.\"            186: TEACHERS (UNQUALIFIED LOYALTY)      \"In connection with the problems facing the friends in their teaching  work; these, the Guardian is well aware, are by no means easy to overcome,  specially in view of the limited number and resources of the believers.  But in the field of Baha'i service, as the history of the Cause abundantly  demonstrates, there is no obstacle that can be said to be unsurmountable.  Every difficulty will, in due time, be solved. But continued and  collective effort is also needed. The Baha'i teacher should not get  discouraged at the consciousness of the limitations within or without him.  He should rather persevere, and be confident, that no matter how numerous  and perplexing the difficulties that confront him may appear, he is  continually assisted and guided through Divine Confirmations. He should  consider himself as a mere instrument in the Hands of God, and should,  therefore, cease looking at his own merits.    \"The first and most important qualification of a Baha'i Teacher is,  indeed, unqualified loyalty and attachment to the Cause. Knowledge is, of  course essential; but compared to devotion it is secondary in importance.\"            187: TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS (CAN SERVE AS BOTH)      \"Regarding the statement made by the Guardian ... concerning the fact that  believers can serve both as teachers and administrators. Shoghi Effendi  would approve your Assembly making this fact known to all the friends. For  although it is essential for the believers to maintain always a clear  distinction between teaching and administrative duties and functions, yet  they should be careful not to be led to think that these two types of  Baha'i activity are mutually exclusive in their nature and as such cannot  be exercised by one and the same person. As a matter of fact, the friends  should be encouraged to serve in both the teaching and the administrative  fields of Baha'i service. But as there are always some who are more  specially gifted along one of these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#14)"],[1," of the Faith not  only in India and Burma but in the neighbouring regions where the light of  the Teachings has not yet penetrated. It is his sincere hope that the  National Assembly will, faithful to its pledge, continue exerting its  utmost for the furtherance of the cause of teaching in India, and  particularly in Southern India and Ceylon where there are almost no  centres at present. Nothing short of the unity, self sacrifice and  intelligent and systematized planning which the local and national  assemblies and also the individual believers may show forth throughout the  coming years can enable them to attain this vital teaching goal.    [From the Guardian:]    I hasten to assure you in person of my personal and intense satisfaction  and of my special and fervent prayers for these two stalwart pioneers who  have arisen to accomplish so noble a task in such difficult circumstances.  The hosts of the Abha Kingdom will assuredly guide and sustain them, and  will, if they persevere, crown their high endeavours with success. May  their example be followed by an increasingly large number of their fellow  workers.    October 22, 1936          Inflexible Determination Required      Now, that the teaching work is making a steady headway, the friends should  be on their guard lest they lose the opportunity they have of spreading  the Message in every corner throughout India and Burma.    In this connection, he feels, he must congratulate most warmly the members  of the N.S.A. for the valuable steps they have taken for the introduction  of the Cause in central and southern India.    [From the Guardian:]    The progress of the teaching activities initiated by your Assembly is  highly gratifying. Inflexible determination is required to carry it to a  successful conclusion. The methods adopted by the American Baha'i  community, the zeal, the initiative, the efficiency, the fidelity with  which they are prosecuting their enterprise should be exemplified by  individuals and Assemblies in India and Burma. The administrative  machinery which the American believers have erected and perfected has  already had its counterpart in the institutions you have so nobly reared  in recent years. Your teaching campaign, the supreme purpose for which  this machinery has been fashioned, should likewise be modelled according  to the plan which your sister community has devised and is now developing  so strenuously and successfully.    November 7, 1936          Welcome Extended to Mr. Schopflocher      He wishes me now to express in particular to you, and to your  distinguished fellow-members in the Indian N.S.A., his most loving  appreciation and thanks for the cordial welcome you have extended to our  dearly-beloved friend, Mr. Siegfried Schopflocher, during his visit to  India and Burma. He is confident that the steps you have taken to render  his trip successful will greatly help in giving the Faith a wide and  long-needed publicity. The opportunity that has been offered you has been  truly splendid, and you certainly deserve to be heartily congratulated for  having fully availed yourselves of it. May the Beloved reward you a  thousand-fold for your ceaseless and devoted endeavours in His Path.    January 7, 1937          Theosophists      With regard to the Theosophists and their activities; although they  obviously try to copy and claim as their own some of the principles of the  Cause, yet the Guardian feels that it would be of no advantage to oppose  them and to refute their arguments. The best attitude for the friends to  adopt in such cases at the present time is to totally disregard and even  neglect their opponents. This has invariably been his advice to the  friends, whether in the East or in the West.          Baha'i Holidays      Regarding the sale of tea and other refreshments in a cinema under  non-Baha'i ownership; those friends who have hired from the owner of the  cinema a stall for the sale of such refreshments should make every effort  to obtain permission to close on Baha'i holidays. In case, however, the  non-Baha'i owner or partner refuses to grant their request their only  alternative is to obey.    The case is different with a bread bakery owned by a believer. In this  case there can be no excuse whatever why the shop should not be closed  during Baha'i holidays, as there are always non-Baha'i bakers from whom  the public can buy.          Baha'i Administration      Concerning the LSA's right to suspend one of its members from Assembly  membership; the Assembly can, by a majority vote, take such an action,  even though the suspension may be for a long period.    As regards your question whether the President of the N.S.A. is entitled  to give any ruling during the period of his tenure; the Guardian wishes me  to state that no such ruling can be valid unless approved by the other  members of the National Assembly. The President has no special legislative  capacity, except as a member of the Assembly.    As to the question of removing a believer from the voting list; although  every duly constituted local Assembly has the right to take such an action  against any individual believer in the community, nevertheless the  Guardian feels the advisability for the Local Assemblies to seek the  advice and approval of the N.S.A. in this most delicate and vital matter,  as it is one fraught with grave and far-reaching responsibilities.    Before closing I wish to express to you, and through you to your  fellow-members in the N.S.A., how happy the Guardian feels to learn of the  strong preparations your Assembly has made for the holding of the next  Annual Convention of the friends in Karachi. He is the more rejoiced that  the main item of the discussions will be the problem of teaching. He is  fervently praying that the program upon which the delegates and the N.S.A.  will decide will mark the inauguration of an unprecedented teaching  campaign throughout India and Burma.    [From the Guardian:]    I am delighted to learn of the work which is being steadily and  efficiently accomplished in so many spheres of Baha'i activity throughout  India and Burma. My heart is filled with gratitude as I witness the  progress you have achieved, the enterprises you have initiated, the method  and measures you have adopted, the plans you have conceived and above all  the spirit of exemplary loyalty and magnificent devotion that impels you  forward in the great mission you are destined to fulfil.    February 28, 1937          Obligatory Prayers      ...concerning the three daily obligatory prayers. The friends are free to  choose any one of these three prayers, but have to follow the instructions  revealed by Baha'u'llah concerning them. The long prayer should be recited  once in every 24 hours, and is accompanied by certain physical acts. The  short prayer, consisting of one verse, should be recited once a day at  noon; while the medium prayer should be said three times a day: in the  morning, at noon and in the evening. The believer is entirely free to  choose any one of these three prayers for daily use.    While praying it would be better to turn one's thoughts to the  Manifestation as He continues, in the other world, to be our means of  contact with the Almighty. We can, however, pray directly to God Himself.    April 27, 1937          Progress of Teaching Most Gratifying      The reports of the progress of the teaching work in India and Burma are  most gratifying, and all indicate the high measure of devotion and zeal  which the friends are putting at the service of this most noble and sacred  task. Dr. Ali of Rangoon is specially active working through the press,  and has already succeeded in giving a very wide publicity to the Faith in  many circles, both native and foreign. He is certainly the most promising  teacher we have in Rangoon, and the N.S.A. would do well to encourage him,  and to give him every possible assistance with the view of further  extending the scope of his teaching activities throughout Burma.    [From the Guardian:]    I am so glad ... of the progress of the teaching work in India and Burma.  I pray that Martha's forthcoming visit to your shores may greatly  stimulate the splendid work which has been so nobly initiated and is being  so painstakingly continued.    July 12, 1937          National Fund      I wish, in particular, to express his gratification at the success that  has attended your annual Convention this year, and at the recommendations  and decisions taken by the N.S.A. with the view of intensifying the  teaching campaign throughout India and Burma. He would strongly urge your  Assembly to maintain the standard of the teaching work, and to appeal to  the friends to rise up to the call of the hour, and to be ready to undergo  any sacrifice that their sacred task requires.    Above all he wishes through you to reiterate his wish, already expressed  in his recent cable to the N.S.A., that the National Fund, which  undoubtedly constitutes the bedrock upon which all the activities of the  Cause ultimately rest, should receive the continued and whole-hearted  support of all the believers. Both the local Assemblies and the individual  believers should realize that unless they contribute regularly and  generously to that Fund the progress of the Faith in India and Burma will  not only be considerably retarded, but will inevitably come to a  standstill. There should be a continual flow of funds to the National  treasury of the N.S.A., if that body wishes to properly administer the  manifold and ever-increasing activities of the Faith. Every Baha'i no  matter how poor, must realize what a grave responsibility he has to  shoulder in this connection, and should have confidence that his spiritual  progress as a believer in the World Order of Baha'u'llah will largely  depend upon the measure in which he proves, in deeds, his readiness to  support materially the divine institutions of His Faith.
