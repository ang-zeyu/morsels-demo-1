Circumstances beyond the control of popular  assemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled cooeperation  among them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still cooeperation. The  American people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their  trades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the  arts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of  statecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so  tenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.    =The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with  the problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the  Americans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many  common ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly  fear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,  composed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The  colonies so united were bound together in \"a firm and perpetual league  of friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and  succor, upon all just occasions.\" They made provision for distributing  the burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of  commissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For  some twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold  meetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate  border.    Virginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of  intercolonial cooeperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the  Old Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the  colonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany  with the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of  mutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion cooeperated loyally  with the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.    =The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was  made in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a  conference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise  measures of defense against the French, and to enter into \"articles of  union and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's  subjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of  war.\" New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,  Pennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a  plan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was  adopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The  colonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the  scheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that  it had \"too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution.\"  Though the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study  because it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved  until thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which  also Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United  States.    [Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]    =The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed  the provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art  of defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last  French and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to  the Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,  it is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and  the conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands  of Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the  field. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that  were not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen  could do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars  operating on American soil. \"This whole transaction,\" shrewdly remarked  Franklin of Braddock's campaign, \"gave us Americans the first suspicion  that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not  been well founded.\" It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel  who drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the  army of the Revolution was the brave officer who had \"spurned the  whistle of bullets\" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.    =Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were  learning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the  conflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left  New England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was  especially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by  the colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper  currency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce  was driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the  end came, both England and America were staggering under heavy  liabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices  accompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of  ten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation  had to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel  which led to American independence.    =The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the  defeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to  estimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance  that the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no  foreign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.  American leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis  were driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country  to fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,  though defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,  as events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by  Franklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the  Revolution.      COLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT    It was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought  forth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife  with the mother country which culminated in union for the war of  independence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the  colonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of  events in English domestic politics, and English measures of control  over the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be  taken into account.    =The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)  and the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan regime  (1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had  little time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial  affairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by  internal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the  House of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II  (1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade  by act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and  powerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same  time a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by  the annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so  much self-government on the Puritans.    Charles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his  authority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus  inaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he  would have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his  dominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.  He determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more  efficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He  made a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New  York, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last  days of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of  Connecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and  hidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.    For several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of  ill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not  accustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his  opinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the  Old South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to  a preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle  of his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came  that King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people  of Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to  dispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated  governor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under  guard.    The overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary  and by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the  colonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was  given another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,  restored the spirit if not the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16965"],[0,"Queen Victoria (#14)"],[1," him very weak and irritable.    The physicians in attendance were now obliged to tell her that the  illness was low fever, but that the patient himself was not to know  of this. The Ministers became alarmed at his state, and when the news  of his illness became public there was the greatest and most  universal anxiety for news.    In spite of slight improvements from time to time, the Prince showed  no power of fighting the disease, and on the evening of the 14th  December he passed gently away.    It is no exaggeration to say that the death of the Queen's beloved  husband saddened every home in the land; it was a sorrow felt equally  by the highest and the lowest. He died in the fulness of his manhood,  leaving her whom he had loved and guarded so tenderly to reign in  lonely splendour.    In the dedication of _Idylls of the King_ to the memory of Prince  Albert, Tennyson, the poet-laureate, wrote:        Break not, O woman's-heart, but still endure;      Break not, for thou art Royal, but endure,      Remembering all the beauty of that star      Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made      One light together, but has past and leaves      The Crown a lonely splendour.    When one looks over the vista of years which have passed since that  mournful day, it is with sadness mingled with regret. For it is too  true that \"a prophet is not without honour, save in his own country.\"    'Albert the Good' was, like many other great men, in advance of his  times, and not until he was dead did the nation as a whole realize  the blank he had left behind him.    Even so late as 1854 Greville writes in his Diary of the extraordinary  attacks which were made upon the Prince in the public Press. Letter  after letter, he noted, appeared \"full of the bitterest abuse and  all sorts of lies. . . . The charges against him are principally to  this effect, that he has been in the habit of meddling improperly  in public affairs, and has used his influence to promote objects of  his own and the interests of his own family at the expense of the  interests of this country; that he is German and not English in his  sentiments and principles; that he corresponds with foreign princes  and with British Ministers abroad without the knowledge of the  Government, and that he thwarts the foreign policy of the Ministers  when it does not coincide with his own ideas and purposes.\" And again:  \"It was currently reported in the Midland and Northern counties, and  actually stated in a Scotch paper, that Prince Albert had been  committed to the Tower, and there were people found credulous and  foolish enough to believe it.\"            But English gratitude is always such      To hate the hand which doth oblige too much.    These words of Daniel Defoe help to explain something of the attitude  of a part of the nation toward the Prince in his lifetime.    He had given his life in the service of his wife and his adopted  country, but he was a 'foreigner,' and the insular Briton, brought  up in the blissful belief that \"one Englishman was as good as three  Frenchmen,\" could not and would not overcome his distrust of one who  had not been, like himself, so singularly blessed in his nationality.    But Time has its revenges, and the services of Prince Albert will  \"smell sweet and blossom in the dust\" long after the very names of  once famous lights of the Victorian era have been forgotten.    His home life was singularly sweet and happy, and a great contrast  to that of some of his wife's predecessors upon the English throne.  The Queen, writing to her Uncle Leopold in this the twenty-first year  of their marriage, says: \"_Very_ few can say with me that their  husband at the end of twenty-one years is _not_ only full of the  friendship, kindness, and affection which a truly happy marriage  brings with it, but the same tender love of the _very first days of  our marriage_!\"    The Prince, in a letter to a friend, rejoiced that their marriage  \"still continues green and fresh and throws out vigorous roots, from  which I can, with gratitude to God, acknowledge that much good will  yet be engendered for the world.\"    The finest tribute to the Prince Consort's memory is to be found in  the Dedication written by Lord Tennyson to his _Idylls of the King_:        These to His Memory--since he held them dear,      Perchance as finding there unconsciously      Some image of himself--I dedicate,      I dedicate, I consecrate with tears--      These Idylls.    Like Arthur, 'the flower of kings,' he was a man of ideals, above  petty jealousies and small ambitions:        Hereafter, thro' all times, Albert the Good.    The _Idylls_ produced such a deep impression upon the Prince that  he wrote to the author, asking him to inscribe his name in the volume.  The book remained always a great favourite with him, and Princess  Frederick William was engaged upon a series of pictures illustrating  her favourite passages at the time of his death.    An enumeration of the varied activities of Prince Albert during his  lifetime would need a volume. His position was always a difficult  one and was seldom made easier by the section of the Press which  singled him out as a target for its poisoned arrows. Only a strong  sense of duty and an unwavering belief in his wife's love could have  sustained him through the many dark hours of tribulation and sorrow.  He rose early all the year round, and prepared drafts of answers to  the Queen's Ministers, wrote letters and had cleared off a  considerable amount of work before many men would have thought of  beginning the day's tasks.    [Illustration: THE ALBERT MEMORIAL]    No article of any importance in the newspapers or magazines escaped  his attention. Every one appealed to him for help or advice, and none  asked in vain. His wide knowledge and judgment were freely used by  the Queen's statesmen, and the day proved all too short for the  endless amount of work which had to be done.    In spite of increasing burdens and poor health he was always in good  spirits. \"At breakfast and at luncheon, and also at our family  dinners, he sat at the top of the table, and kept us all enlivened  by his interesting conversation, by his charming anecdotes, and  droll stories without end of his childhood, of people at Coburg, of  our good people in Scotland, which he would repeat with a wonderful  power of mimicry, and at which he would himself laugh most heartily.  Then he would at other times entertain us with his talk about the  most interesting and important topics of the present and of former  days, on which it was ever a pleasure to hear him speak.\"[10]    [Footnote 10: Queen Victoria's _Journal_.]    His rule in life was to make his position entirely a part of the  Queen's, \"to place all his time and powers at her command.\" Every  speech which he made in public was carefully considered beforehand,  and then written out and committed to memory. As he had to speak in  a foreign tongue, he considered this precaution absolutely necessary.  At the same time it often made him feel shy and nervous when speaking  before strangers, and this sometimes gave to those who did not know  him a mistaken impression of coldness and reserve.    His sympathy with the working classes was sincere and practical. He  was convinced that \"any real improvement must be the result of the  exertion of the working people themselves.\" He was President of the  Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes, and  never lost an opportunity of pointing out that, to quote his own words,  \"the Royal Family are not merely living upon the earnings of the  people (as these publications try to represent) without caring for  the poor labourers, but that they are anxious about their welfare,  and ready to co-operate in any scheme for the amelioration of their  condition. We may possess these feelings, and yet the mass of the  people may be ignorant of it, because they have never heard it  expressed to them, or seen any tangible proof of it.\"    His grasp of detail and knowledge of home and foreign political  affairs astonished every one who met him, ministers and ambassadors  alike. His writing-table and that of the Queen stood side by side  in their sitting-room, and here they used to work together, every  dispatch which left their hands being the joint work of both. The  Prince corrected and revised everything carefully before it received  the Queen's signature. Considering the small amount of time at his  disposal, it was remarkable how much he was able to read, and read  thoroughly, both with the Queen and by himself. \"Not many, but much,\"  was his principle, and every book read was carefully noted in his  diary.    Even to the last he exerted his influence in the cause of peace. The  American Civil War broke out in 1861, and Great Britain declared her  neutrality. But an incident, known as 'The Trent Affair,' nearly  brought about a declaration of war.    The Southern States, or 'Confederates,' as they were usually called,  sent two commissioners to Europe on board the British mail steamer  _Trent_. The _Trent_ was fired upon and boarded by a Federal officer,  who arrested the commissioners.    This was regarded as an insult to our flag, as it was a breach of  international law to attack the ship of a neutral power. The  Government therefore decided to demand redress, and a dispatch,  worded by Palmerston, was forwarded to the Queen for her signature.    The Prince realized at once that if the dispatch were forwarded as  it was written it would lead to open war between the Northern States  and our country, and he suggested certain alterations to the Queen,  who agreed to them. A more courteously worded message was sent, and  the Northern States at once agreed to liberate the commissioners and  offered an ample apology.          CHAPTER XII: _Friends and Advisers_      Possibly the person to whom the Queen owed most--next to her  husband--was Lord Melbourne."]]]
