I, therefore, ordered the men to proceed with all speed,  and to leave behind those who could not go on. The General did not  appear to be \"links\"[34] at this, but called out with his loud voice,  \"Come on, burghers!\"    We were fortunate in being able to keep up with the enemy by riding  along a little plain, which was hidden from them by an intervening hill.  Our course ran in a direction parallel to their line of march, and at a  distance of about six miles from it. But unluckily, the English were the  first to reach the ridge. When we appeared at the point where the hill  which had concealed us from them came to an end, their vanguard had just  passed the eastern end of the ridge at which we were both aiming; and we  had still some four or five miles to go before we could reach it.    I saw that the enemy was not strong enough to occupy the whole ridge, so  I at once gave orders to General De Villiers to advance, and to seize  the western end at a point just above the farmstead of Mostertshoek.  The enemy, observing this manoeuvre, took up their position on the  eastern extremity of the ridge. Whereupon I divided the remaining  burghers into small companies, with orders to occupy kopjes from six to  seven hundred paces still further to the east; leaving to myself and  Commandant Nel the task of seizing a small ridge which lay south-east of  the English lines.    All these positions would have to be taken under fire, and before making  the attempt I sent the following note to the British Commanding  Officer:--         \"SIR,--         \"I am here with five hundred men, and am every moment expecting       reinforcements with three Krupps, against which you will not be       able to hold out. I therefore advise you, in order to prevent       bloodshed, to surrender.\"    I sent this note post haste, and then rested a little while awaiting the  return of the despatch rider.    And now a shameful incident occurred. The messenger had received the  answer to my letter, and had covered about a hundred paces on his way  back, when the enemy opened so heavy a fire upon him that it is  inexplicable how he managed to come through unscathed.    The answer which he brought from the officer was in the following  terms:--    \"I'm d----d if I surrender!\"    I at once ordered my men to rush the positions which I had already  pointed out to them; and notwithstanding the fierce opposition of the  enemy, they succeeded in carrying out my orders.    But although we had thus gained very good positions, those which the  English held were quite as good, and perhaps even better, except for the  fact that they were cut off from the water. However, when they had first  become aware of our presence--that is, while they were at  Muishondsfontein--they had taken the precaution of filling their  water-bottles.    Our guns did not arrive until so late in the afternoon that only a few  shots could be fired before it became dark.    Acting upon my orders, the burghers kept such good watch during the  night that escape was impossible for the English. I also sent a strong  guard to a point near Reddersburg, for I had heard that a reinforcement  of from thirteen hundred to two thousand British troops had come from  the direction of Bothathanie railway station, and were now encamped at  Reddersburg.    I had begun operations with only four hundred men under me, but before  the sun rose on the following day my force had been doubled by the  addition of those who had been compelled to remain behind and rest their  tired horses.    On the previous evening it had seemed to me highly improbable that we  should be able to storm the ridge in the morning. I had expected that  the force at Reddersburg--which lay only about four or five miles from  Mostertshoek--would have seen the fight in progress, or heard the  cannonading, and would have hastened to the assistance of their  comrades.[35] Nevertheless, I had given orders that as soon as it was  daylight, every one must do his utmost to force the English to  surrender.    It was now rapidly growing lighter, and I ordered the gunners to keep up  a continuous fire with our three Krupps. This they did from half-past  five until eleven o'clock, and then the enemy hoisted the white flag.    My men and I galloped towards the English, and our other two parties did  the same. But before we reached them, they again began to shoot, killing  Veldtcornet Du Plessis, of Kroonstad. This treacherous act enraged our  burghers, who at once commenced to fire with deadly effect.    Soon the white flag appeared above almost every stone behind which an  Englishman lay, but our men did not at once cease firing. Indeed! I had  the greatest difficulty in calming them, and in inducing them to stop,  for they were, as may well be imagined, furious at the misuse of the  white flag.    Strewn everywhere about on the ground lay the English killed and  wounded. According to the official statement, they had a hundred  casualties, the commanding officer himself being amongst the killed.    We took four hundred and seventy prisoners of war, all of them belonging  to the Royal Irish Rifles and the Mounted Infantry. But I cared nothing  to what regiment they belonged or what was the rank of the officer in  command. Throughout the whole war I never troubled myself about such  matters.    Our loss, in addition to Veldtcornet Du Plessis, whose death I have just  described, was only six wounded.    I had no longer any need to fear a reinforcement from Reddersburg, but  nevertheless there was no time to be lost, for I had just heard from a  prisoner of war that a telegram had been sent from Dewetsdorp to the  garrison at Smithfield, bidding them consult their own safety by  withdrawing to Aliwal North. I made up my mind to capture that garrison  before it could decamp. I waited until I saw that the English ambulances  were busy with their wounded, and then with all speed rode off.    As the direct road might prove to be held by Lord Roberts, I caused the  prisoners of war to be marched to Winburg via Thaba'Nchu. From thence  they were to be sent forward by rail to Pretoria.    [Footnote 34: Vexed.]    [Footnote 35: I have never been able to understand why the great force,  stationed at Reddersburg, made no attempt to come to the aid of the  unfortunate victims at Mostertshoek. Their conduct seems to me to have  been even more blameworthy than the similar negligence which occurred at  Sanna's Post. They were not more than five miles off, and could watch  the whole engagement--and yet they never stirred a foot to come and help  their comrades. And it was fortunate for us that it was so, for we  should have stood no chance at all against a large force.    To oppose successfully such bodies of men as our burghers had to meet  during this war demanded _rapidity of action_ more than anything else.  We had to be quick at fighting, quick at reconnoitring, quick (if it  became necessary) at flying! This was exactly what I myself aimed at,  and had not so many of our burghers proved false to their own colours,  England--as the great Bismarck foretold--would have found her grave in  South Africa.]          CHAPTER XI    An Unsuccessful Siege      My object now was to reach Smithfield. We set out at once and late in  the evening I divided my commandos into two parties. The first, some  five hundred men in all, consisted chiefly of Smithfield burghers under  Commandant Swanepoel, of Yzervarkfontein, but there were also some  Wepener men amongst them. I gave General Froneman the command over this  party, and ordered him to proceed without delay and attack the small  English garrison at Smithfield. With the second party I rode off to join  the burghers who were under General J.B. Wessels.    I came up with Wessels' division on the 6th of April at Badenhorst, on  the road from Dewetsdorp to Wepener. Badenhorst lies at a distance of  some ten miles from a ford on the Caledon River, called  Tammersbergsdrift, where Colonel Dalgety, with the highly renowned  C.M.R.[36] and Brabant's Horse were at that time stationed. I call them  \"highly renowned\" to be in the fashion, for I must honestly avow that I  never could see for what they were renowned.    During the fight at Mostertshoek on the previous day I had kept them  under observation, with the result that I learnt that they had  entrenched themselves strongly, and that they numbered about sixteen  hundred men, though this latter fact was a matter of indifference to me.  The history of Ladysmith, Mafeking, and Kimberley, however, served me as  a warning, and I asked myself whether it would be better to besiege the  wolf or to wait and see if he would not come out of his lair.    But the wolf, on this occasion, was not to be enticed out on any  pretext; and moreover it was probable that Lord Roberts would be able to  send a relieving force from Bloemfontein; so I decided to attack at  once. First, however, I despatched some of my best scouts in the  direction of Bloemfontein and Reddersburg, while I ordered the commandos  under Generals Piet de Wet and A.P. Cronje to take up positions to the  east and south-east of the capital.    Early in the morning of the 7th of April I made an attack on two points:  one to the south-west, the other to the south-east of Dalgety's  fortifications, opening fire on his troops at distances of from five to  fifteen hundred paces. I dare not approach any nearer for lack of  suitable cover. The place was so strongly fortified that many valuable  lives must have been sacrificed, had I been less cautious than I was.    After a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1881"],[0,"The Call of the Canyon (#14)"],[1,". Will you get out of it?\"    \"Hello, Glenn! What time is it?\" she replied.    \"It's nearly six.\"    \"What!... Do you expect me to get up at that ungodly hour?\"    \"We're all up. Flo's eating breakfast. It's going to be a bad day, I'm  afraid. And we want to get packed and moving before it starts to rain.\"    \"Why do girls leave home?\" she asked, tragically.    \"To make poor devils happy, of course,\" he replied, smiling down upon  her.    That smile made up to Carley for all the clamoring sensations of stiff,  sore muscles. It made her ashamed that she could not fling herself into  this adventure with all her heart. Carley essayed to sit up. \"Oh, I'm  afraid my anatomy has become disconnected!... Glenn, do I look a sight?\"  She never would have asked him that if she had not known she could bear  inspection at such an inopportune moment.    \"You look great,\" he asserted, heartily. \"You've got color. And as for  your hair--I like to see it mussed that way. You were always one to have  it dressed--just so.... Come, Carley, rustle now.\"    Thus adjured, Carley did her best under adverse circumstances. And she  was gritting her teeth and complimenting herself when she arrived at the  task of pulling on her boots. They were damp and her feet appeared  to have swollen. Moreover, her ankles were sore. But she accomplished  getting into them at the expense of much pain and sundry utterances  more forcible than elegant. Glenn brought her warm water, a mitigating  circumstance. The morning was cold and thought of that biting desert  water had been trying.    \"Shore you're doing fine,\" was Flo's greeting. \"Come and get it before  we throw it out.\"    Carley made haste to comply with the Western mandate, and was once again  confronted with the singular fact that appetite did not wait upon the  troubles of a tenderfoot. Glenn remarked that at least she would not  starve to death on the trip.    \"Come, climb the ridge with me,\" he invited. \"I want you to take a look  to the north and east.\"    He led her off through the cedars, up a slow red-earth slope, away from  the lake. A green moundlike eminence topped with flat red rock appeared  near at hand and not at all a hard climb. Nevertheless, her eyes  deceived her, as she found to the cost of her breath. It was both far  away and high.    \"I like this location,\" said Glenn. \"If I had the money I'd buy this  section of land--six hundred and forty acres--and make a ranch of it.  Just under this bluff is a fine open flat bench for a cabin. You could  see away across the desert clear to Sunset Peak. There's a good spring  of granite water. I'd run water from the lake down into the lower flats,  and I'd sure raise some stock.\"    \"What do you call this place?\" asked Carley, curiously.    \"Deep Lake. It's only a watering place for sheep and cattle. But there's  fine grazing, and it's a wonder to me no one has ever settled here.\"    Looking down, Carley appreciated his wish to own the place; and  immediately there followed in her a desire to get possession of this  tract of land before anyone else discovered its advantages, and to  hold it for Glenn. But this would surely conflict with her intention  of persuading Glenn to go back East. As quickly as her impulse had been  born it died.    Suddenly the scene gripped Carley. She looked from near to far, trying  to grasp the illusive something. Wild lonely Arizona land! She saw  ragged dumpy cedars of gray and green, lines of red earth, and a round  space of water, gleaming pale under the lowering clouds; and in the  distance isolated hills, strangely curved, wandering away to a black  uplift of earth obscured in the sky.    These appeared to be mere steps leading her sight farther and higher to  the cloud-navigated sky, where rosy and golden effulgence betokened the  sun and the east. Carley held her breath. A transformation was going on  before her eyes.    \"Carley, it's a stormy sunrise,\" said Glenn.    His words explained, but they did not convince. Was this sudden-bursting  glory only the sun rising behind storm clouds? She could see the clouds  moving while they were being colored. The universal gray surrendered  under some magic paint brush. The rifts widened, and the gloom of the  pale-gray world seemed to vanish. Beyond the billowy, rolling, creamy  edges of clouds, white and pink, shone the soft exquisite fresh blue  sky. And a blaze of fire, a burst of molten gold, sheered up from behind  the rim of cloud and suddenly poured a sea of sunlight from east to  west. It transfigured the round foothills. They seemed bathed in  ethereal light, and the silver mists that overhung them faded while  Carley gazed, and a rosy flush crowned the symmetrical domes. Southward  along the horizon line, down-dropping veils of rain, just touched with  the sunrise tint, streamed in drifting slow movement from cloud to  earth. To the north the range of foothills lifted toward the majestic  dome of Sunset Peak, a volcanic upheaval of red and purple cinders, bare  as rock, round as the lower hills, and wonderful in its color. Full in  the blaze of the rising sun it flaunted an unchangeable front. Carley  understood now what had been told her about this peak. Volcanic fires  had thrown up a colossal mound of cinders burned forever to the hues  of the setting sun. In every light and shade of day it held true to its  name. Farther north rose the bold bulk of the San Francisco Peaks,  that, half lost in the clouds, still dominated the desert scene. Then as  Carley gazed the rifts began to close. Another transformation began, the  reverse of what she watched. The golden radiance of sunrise vanished,  and under a gray, lowering, coalescing pall of cloud the round hills  returned to their bleak somberness, and the green desert took again its  cold sheen.    \"Wasn't it fine, Carley?\" asked Glenn. \"But nothing to what you will  experience. I hope you stay till the weather gets warm. I want you to  see a summer dawn on the Painted Desert, and a noon with the great white  clouds rolling up from the horizon, and a sunset of massed purple and  gold. If they do not get you then I'll give up.\"    Carley murmured something of her appreciation of what she had just seen.  Part of his remark hung on her ear, thought-provoking and disturbing. He  hoped she would stay until summer! That was kind of him. But her visit  must be short and she now intended it to end with his return East with  her. If she did not persuade him to go he might not want to go for a  while, as he had written--\"just yet.\" Carley grew troubled in mind. Such  mental disturbance, however, lasted no longer than her return with Glenn  to camp, where the mustang Spillbeans stood ready for her to mount. He  appeared to put one ear up, the other down, and to look at her with mild  surprise, as if to say: \"What--hello--tenderfoot! Are you going to ride  me again?\"    Carley recalled that she had avowed she would ride him. There was no  alternative, and her misgivings only made matters worse. Nevertheless,  once in the saddle, she imagined she had the hallucination that to  ride off so, with the long open miles ahead, was really thrilling. This  remarkable state of mind lasted until Spillbeans began to trot, and  then another day of misery beckoned to Carley with gray stretches of  distance.    She was to learn that misery, as well as bliss, can swallow up the  hours. She saw the monotony of cedar trees, but with blurred eyes; she  saw the ground clearly enough, for she was always looking down, hoping  for sandy places or rocky places where her mustang could not trot.    At noon the cavalcade ahead halted near a cabin and corral, which turned  out to be a sheep ranch belonging to Hutter. Here Glenn was so busy that  he had no time to devote to Carley. And Flo, who was more at home on  a horse than on the ground, rode around everywhere with the men. Most  assuredly Carley could not pass by the chance to get off Spillbeans and  to walk a little. She found, however, that what she wanted most was to  rest. The cabin was deserted, a dark, damp place with a rank odor. She  did not stay long inside.    Rain and snow began to fall, adding to what Carley felt to be a  disagreeable prospect. The immediate present, however, was cheered by  a cup of hot soup and some bread and butter which the herder Charley  brought her. By and by Glenn and Hutter returned with Flo, and all  partook of some lunch.    All too soon Carley found herself astride the mustang again. Glenn  helped her don the slicker, an abominable sticky rubber coat that  bundled her up and tangled her feet round the stirrups. She was glad to  find, though, that it served well indeed to protect her from raw wind  and rain.    \"Where do we go from here?\" Carley inquired, ironically.    Glenn laughed in a way which proved to Carley that he knew perfectly  well how she felt. Again his smile caused her self-reproach. Plain  indeed was it that he had really expected more of her in the way of  complaint and less of fortitude. Carley bit her lips.    Thus began the afternoon ride. As it advanced the sky grew more  threatening, the wind rawer, the cold keener, and the rain cut like  little bits of sharp ice. It blew in Carley's face. Enough snow fell to  whiten the open patches of ground. In an hour Carley realized that  she had the hardest task of her life to ride to the end of the day's  journey. No one could have guessed her plight. Glenn complimented her  upon her adaptation to such unpleasant conditions. Flo evidently was on  the lookout for the tenderfoot's troubles. But as Spillbeans, had taken  to lagging at a walk, Carley was enabled to conceal all outward sign of  her woes. It rained, hailed, sleeted, snowed, and grew colder all the  time. Carley's feet became lumps of ice. Every step the mustang took  sent acute pains ramifying from bruised and raw places all over her  body.    Once, finding herself behind the others and out of sight in the cedars,"]]]
