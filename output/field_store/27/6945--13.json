Here fountains threw up dancing waters in the air,  cool shady paths and bowers afforded protection from the heat of  the day; and so carefully was it clipped, and kept, that a fallen  leaf would have destroyed its perfection.    The point which the boys had chosen was remote from the house, for  it was of importance that there should be no witnesses of the  meeting. Here, in a spacious arbor, were chairs, couches, and other  signs that some of the family were in the habit of taking their  seats there; and although the boys knew that it might be days  before they succeeded in carrying out their object, yet they  determined to wait, and watch patiently, however long it might be.    Their success, however, surpassed their expectations; for it was  but an hour or two after they had taken up their post, and soon  after the sun had risen, that they saw, walking along the path, the  young lady whom they so desired to meet. She was not alone, for a  black girl walked a little behind her, chatting constantly to her,  and carrying some books, a shawl, and various other articles. When  they reached the arbor the attendant placed the things there, and  then, as she took her seat, the young lady said to the girl:    \"Go in and fetch me my coffee here. Say I shall not come in until  breakfast time, and that if any orders are required, they must come  here for them.\"    \"Will you want me to read to you?\"    \"No,\" the young lady said. \"It is not hot. I shall take a turn  round the garden, first, and then read to myself.\"    The black girl went off at a trot towards the house, and the young  lady strolled round and round that portion of the garden, until her  black attendant returned, with a tray containing coffee, lemonade,  and fruits. This she placed on the table, and then in answer to the  \"You need not wait,\" of the lady, again retired.    Now was the time for the boys, who had watched these operations  with keen interest, and anxiety. It was uncertain whether she would  keep the black attendant by her side, and all depended upon that.    As soon as she was alone, Ned advanced from their hiding place. The  boys had agreed that it was better, at first, that he should  approach alone; lest the sudden appearance of the two, especially  as Gerald was nearly as tall as a man, might have caused alarm; and  she might have flown away, before she had identified Ned as the lad  who had jumped into the water to save her.    Ned approached the arbor with hesitating steps, and felt that his  appearance was, indeed, sorely against him. He had no covering to  his head, had nothing on, indeed, but a pair of trousers. He was  shoeless and stockingless, and presented the appearance of a beggar  boy, rather than the smart young sailor whom she had seen on board  the ship.    The lady started up, with a short exclamation, on seeing a white,  ragged boy standing before her.    \"Who are you?\" she exclaimed, \"and by what right do you enter these  gardens? A white boy, and in rags, how comes this?\"    \"Our ship has been wrecked,\" Ned said, using his best Spanish. \"Do  you not remember me? I am the boy who picked you up when you fell  overboard, on the day when the English captured the ship you came  out in, some four months ago.\"    \"Are you, indeed?\" the young lady said, in surprise. \"Yes, and now  that I look close at you, I recognize your face. Poor boy, how have  you got into a strait like this?\"    Ned understood but little of what she said, as he only knew a few  words in Spanish. It was with difficulty that he could understand  it, even when spoken slowly; while, spoken as a native would do, he  scarce gathered a word. He saw, however, from her attitude, that  her meaning was kind, and that she was disposed to do what she  could for him.    He therefore, in his broken Spanish, told her how a ship, on which  he and five of his comrades were embarked, had been driven ashore  in the hurricane; and all lost, with the exception of another boy,  and himself.    \"It is lucky, indeed,\" the girl said to herself, when he had  finished, \"that I found that my father had left Nombre de Dios, and  had come down to his house here; for, assuredly, the people would  have made short work of these poor lads, had I not been here to aid  them. But, after all, what can I do? My father would, I know, do  anything for my sake; and I have told him how this lad jumped  overboard, to save my life; but there is one here greater than he,  that terrible Inquisition. These boys are heretics, and it will be  impossible to conceal, for any time, from the priests that they are  here. Still, at any rate, for a time we might hide them; and in  gratitude only, I would do all in my power for them.\"    Ned watched her face, as these thoughts passed through her mind. He  saw at once that she was willing to do all in her power, but saw  also that there were difficulties in the way.    \"Poor boy,\" she said, looking at him kindly; \"you must be hungry,  indeed,\" and, taking an ivory mallet, she struck a gong which hung  in the arbor, and made signs to Ned to retire for the present.    The little black girl came running out.    \"I have changed my mind,\" her mistress said. \"Let my breakfast be  sent out here to me, instead of indoors. And I am hungry. Tell the  cook to be sure and let it be a good one, and as soon as possible.\"    Much surprised by these orders, the black girl again left her.    \"My father has gone to town,\" she said to the boys, when they  joined her. \"When he comes back, I will ask him what can be done.  It will not be easy to hide you, for these negroes chatter like so  many parrots; and the news will spread all over the town that some  English boys are here, and in that case they will take you away,  and my father would be powerless as I to help you.\"    The black cook was, indeed, astonished at the demolition of the  breakfast effected by her young mistress; but she put it down to  the fact that she must have given a large portion of it to her  dogs, of which one or more were generally her companions, in the  garden.    Fortunately, on the present occasion, the great bloodhound Zeres  had gone down into the town with his master. Of this, however, the  cook knew nothing; and muttered to herself somewhat angrily, as she  saw the empty dishes which were brought back to her, \"that it was a  sin to give, to that creature, a meal which was sufficient for five  noblemen.\"    When Senor Sagasta returned to his beautiful villa, in the  afternoon, his daughter at once confided to him what had happened.  He entered warmly into her scheme for the aid and protection of the  lads, and expressed himself willing to do anything that she could  suggest.    \"But,\" he said, \"you know as well as I do that, if the news gets  about that two boys of Captain Drake's band are here, nothing will  save them from the rage of the population; and indeed, if the  people and the military authorities were disposed to let them  alone, the Inquisition would be too strong for them, and would  claim its own; and against the Inquisition even governors are  powerless. Therefore if they are to stop, and stop they must, at  least for a time, it must be done in perfect secrecy.    \"There is no possibility of disguising two English boys to look  like negroes. The only plan I can suggest is that they should have  that gardeners' hut. I can remove the man who lives there at  present, and will send him up the country to look after my place  there. Then you must take old David into our confidence. He and his  wife Floey are perfectly faithful, and can be trusted to the death.  It is lucky that she is cook, for she will be able to prepare food  for them. The hut must be kept, of course, locked up at all times;  but as it is close to the fence, and the window indeed looks into  the garden, you can go there of a day and speak to them, and take  them books, and lighten their captivity.    \"When it gets dark I will go with you down the garden, and will see  these brave lads. In the meantime, old David shall get some shirts,  and shoes, and other necessaries for them. We have a plentiful  store of things in the magazine, and he can rig them up there,  perfectly. I will at once get the gardener out of the house, and  will give David instructions to carry the things there, as soon as  it is empty.\"    That evening after it was dark the boys, who had been anxiously  listening for every movement, saw in the dim light the white figure  of the girl advancing, with her father beside her. When she came to  the arbor, she raised her voice.    \"Are you here?\" she cried. \"You can come out without fear.\"    And, as they advanced, \"My father will do all in his power to  protect the savior of his daughter.\"    The merchant shook the hands of the boys, with the stately ceremony  of the Spaniard, and assured them that he was their servant,  indeed, for their treatment of his daughter; and that his house,  and all that it contained, was at their disposal. Ned and Gerald  understood little enough of what he was saying, but his manner and  gestures were sufficient, and they thanked him heartily for his  kindness.    He now led the way, along many winding paths, till they reached a  low fence forming the border of the garden, and distant a long way  from the house. A light was already burning in it, and a black  servant was at work within. There was a break in the fence, by  which they passed through without difficulty; and on entering the  hut, they found everything prepared for them.    On a table stood a dainty supper. The rooms were swept, and fresh  furniture had been placed in them. In these countries furniture is  of the slightest kind. A hammock, to swing in by day or sleep in by  night; a couple of cane chairs; and a mat, of beautifully woven  straw, for the floor. This is nearly all the furniture which is  required, in the tropics.

The chief wood-cutter, however, was bolder-hearted, and lifted the axe  again. As the blade shone uplifted in the sun, the maiden sang once  more,--      \"Throw the axe down, harm not me.    I am an enchanted tree.    He who strikes shall breathe his last    Before Midsummer Eve hath passed.\"    Hearing the voice again, the chief began to feel just the littlest bit  alarmed; nevertheless, he stood his ground and lifted the axe a third  time. Once more the girl sang,--      \"Throw the axe down, harm not me.    I am an enchanted tree.    He who strikes shall breathe his last    Before Midsummer Eve hath passed.\"    At the same moment, the elm managed to throw down a great branch which  struck the rogue a sound thump on the shoulders. Now thoroughly  terrified, the chief wood-cutter himself fled from the spot.    All day long, for fear lest he return, the maiden remained hidden in the  tree. At twilight, overcome by weariness, she fell into a deep sleep.  Just before midnight, alas, she was awakened from her slumber by hearing  an angry voice cry,--    \"Come down from the tree, wicked, deceitful girl, or I shall cut it down  at once!\"    Very much alarmed, the poor maiden looked down through the branches, and  discovered the wood-cutter standing at the foot of the elm. A lantern  swung from his left hand, and his sharpest axe rested on his right  shoulder. He had returned home, and not finding the maiden there, had  suspected that it was her voice which had frightened his men away.    \"Come down,\" roared the rascal. \"I'll teach you, you minx, to play  tricks with me. One--two--three.\" And lifting the axe in the air, he was  about to send it crashing into the trunk of the elm, when the mysterious  murmur which heralded the coming of the King of the Trees sounded  through the wood. Perplexed and frightened again, the chief wood-cutter  let fall his axe. Presently he perceived two beings coming toward him  through the solemn forest. Uttering a howl of fear, the rogue would have  fled, but, lifting his wand, the elder of the newcomers transfixed him  to the spot. The two personages were the King of the Trees and his  friend, the mighty enchanter, Gorbodoc.    \"Descend and fear not, maiden,\" said the King of the Trees. \"You have  done bravely and well. Your misfortunes are over, and a happier day is  at hand.\"    So the brave girl hurried down the tree, and stood before the enchanter  and the King. Very pretty she was, too, in her rustic dress and ribbons.      Lifting his wand with great solemnity, Gorbodoc touched the trunk of the  elm. There was a blinding flash of rosy fire; the great tree appeared to  shrink and dissolve, and presently the Prince stood before them.    \"Welcome, Prince,\" said the enchanter.    \"Your enemy, the witch, will trouble you no more. I have turned her into  an owl and given her to the Queen of Lantern Land. As for you,\" and here  the enchanter turned fiercely upon the wood-cutter, \"you shall be a  green monkey, until you have planted and brought to full growth as many  trees as you have cut down.\"    An instant later, a green monkey swung off into the tree-tops.    Then the grateful Prince thanked the King of the Trees, the mighty  Gorbodoc, and the brave maiden, with all his heart. I am glad to say  that he got his castle back again and married the maiden who had saved  his life, and they lived happily ever after.             THE BIRD BOY    Late one autumn night a young queen stood by her window, gazing upon the  silent and deserted meadows gleaming in the moonlight. Suddenly, far,  far up in the sky, she heard the weird cry of birds flying southward,  and lifting her eyes, the Queen beheld bird after bird fly across the  golden shield of the moon.    \"Oh, lovely, happy birds,\" said she; \"would that I might have a son with  wings!\"    Now it came to pass that before the harvest moon rose again over the  land, the Queen became the mother of a little boy who was born with  wings on his shoulders. But instead of being pleased with so strange and  wonderful a little son, the King (who was very superstitious and under  the domination of wicked chamberlain named Malefico) took it into his  head that his wife was a sorceress, and gave orders that she should be  imprisoned in a lonely tower and the child destroyed. So the Queen and  her baby were taken to an old and gloomy tower on a great rock  overlooking the northern sea; and after they had been there a day or  two, the chief jailer came to the Queen's room to take the child and  kill him.      [Illustration: Foreground, small winged boy seat on the ground, approached  by a large bird in flight; background, small cottage.]      Every year, on the Bird-Boy's birthday, a great gray bird was seen.      The Queen, when she heard this terrible order, uttered a gasping scream,  and seizing her little son from out his cradle, pressed him close to her  breast. But although she fought for her baby with all her might, the  rude strength of the jailers prevailed, and the child was torn from its  mother's arms. Then, before anyone could prevent her, the poor Queen  beat open the rotted fastening of an old casement window, sprang upon  the ledge, and giving one last look of love and tenderness to her  unhappy child, leaped down into the sea surging and pounding over the  rocks hundreds of feet below. She certainly would have been dashed to  pieces, had not a good spirit of the ocean taken pity on her, and  changed her into a great gray bird. Crying mournfully, the bird circled  the old tower thrice, and disappeared over the white-capped waters.    In spite of his roughness, however, the jailer was neither a brutal nor  a wicked man, and he did not relish the cruel task which the King had  given him. So, instead of killing the bird-boy, he carried him many  leagues back into the dark forest which bordered the sea, and gave him  to a family of charcoal-burners. With these rough, good people the  bird-boy lived till he was five years old. And every year, on the boy's  birthday, a great gray bird came flying over the forest from the distant  ocean, circled thrice the charcoal-burners' hut, and disappeared again,  crying mournfully.    One midsummer day, with a great deal of merry hallooing and blowing of  sweet-voiced horns, the King of the country, accompanied by his young  wife, came hunting through the wood. There was a pretty spring near the  door of the hut, and the party came to a halt at its edge. Out ran the  winged boy and his two little foster-brothers, to see the wonderful  sight. And a wonderful sight it was, indeed, to see the horses tossing  their jeweled bridles, the hooded falcons riding on the saddlebow,  clutching the leather with their curving claws, the merry young pages in  their dark suits, and all the gay company in rich attire.    \"Why, see,\" said the young Queen to her husband, \"yon little boy hath  wings. Really, dear, I must have him for my page. Would n't it be  wonderful to have a winged page? Besides, he will be a playmate for  Rosabella.\"    So the King gave the charcoal-burner and his wife fifty pieces of bright  gold, which pleased them very much, and the charcoal-burner himself  lifted the bird-boy up in his arms, and placed him on the King's saddle.  Then the bird-boy waved good-bye to his two little ragged  foster-brothers, who were howling as if their hearts would break, and  rode away with the King. In a few hours the company came to a splendid  castle of shining white stone, standing in beautiful green gardens  running down to the sea. Once at home, the Queen commanded that the  little winged boy be washed and tidied, and his charcoal-burner's rags  replaced with a pretty black velvet suit. You may be sure that, when the  bird-boy was washed and dressed, there was no handsomer, more winning  little boy in all the world.    So the bird-boy became the best beloved playmate of the Queen's only  child, her darling Rosabella. Now, if the bird-boy was the prettiest  little boy in all the world, Rosabella was the prettiest little girl.  Moreover, she had a sweet disposition, which is a gift even more  precious than the gift of beauty. It was a lovely picture to see the  children building toy castles on the floor of the nursery in the castle  tower, the sun streaming on the black-brown hair and silver white wings  of the little boy, and on the golden curls of Rosabella.    Twelve years passed. The bird-boy grew into a handsome lad; Rosabella  into the loveliest of princesses. Twice had the bird-boy saved  Rosabella's life. He had saved her the first time by swooping down and  catching her in his wings just as she was about to tread on a wicked  yellow viper; he had saved her in the same way when she had fallen over  a cliff at the edge of the sea.    Every year, on the bird-boy's birthday, a great gray bird would fly in  from over the sea, circle the castle thrice, and disappear, crying  mournfully.    Now when the bird-boy and Rosabella were in their seventeenth year, it  came to pass that the King was summoned to war. His enemy was no other  than the wicked chamberlain Malefico, who had succeeded to the kingdom  of the bird-boy's father, when that Prince had died some years before.  So the good King, who had been a real father to the bird-boy, put on his  shining armor, kissed his dear wife and child good-bye, and rode off to  the battlefield. The bird-boy begged and pleaded to be taken with him as  his squire, but the King would not hear of it, and insisted that he  remain in the castle to take care of the Queen and Rosabella. There was  little cheer in the castle that unhappy evening. And all night long, the  bird-boy thought he could hear the wings of a great bird beating  fiercely against the window-panes.    A month passed, an unhappy month in which there were no tidings from the  King. Then, one rainy morning, a messenger who had ridden so"]]]
