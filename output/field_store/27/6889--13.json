All the ships  shortened sail, and there was fear and trembling on every side, but she  sat quietly on her floating iceberg watching the blue lightning flash in  zigzags down on to the shining sea.    The first time any of the sisters rose above the water she was delighted  by the novelties and beauties she saw; but once grown up, and at liberty  to go where she liked, she became indifferent and longed for her home;  in the course of a month or so they all said that after all their own  home in the deep was best, it was so cosy there.    Many an evening the five sisters interlacing their arms would rise above  the water together. They had lovely voices, much clearer than any  mortal, and when a storm was rising, and they expected ships to be  wrecked, they would sing in the most seductive strains of the wonders of  the deep, bidding the seafarers have no fear of them. But the sailors  could not understand the words, they thought it was the voice of the  storm; nor could it be theirs to see this Elysium of the deep, for when  the ship sank they were drowned, and only reached the Merman's palace in  death. When the elder sisters rose up in this manner, arm-in-arm, in the  evening, the youngest remained behind quite alone, looking after them as  if she must weep; but mermaids have no tears, and so they suffer all the  more.    'Oh! if I were only fifteen!' she said, 'I know how fond I shall be of  the world above, and of the mortals who dwell there.'    At last her fifteenth birthday came.    'Now we shall have you off our hands,' said her grandmother, the old  queen-dowager. 'Come now, let me adorn you like your other sisters!' and  she put a wreath of white lilies round her hair, but every petal of the  flowers was half a pearl; then the old queen had eight oysters fixed on  to the princess's tail to show her high rank.    'But it hurts so!' said the little mermaid.    'You must endure the pain for the sake of the finery!' said her  grandmother.    But oh! how gladly would she have shaken off all this splendour, and  laid aside the heavy wreath. Her red flowers in her garden suited her  much better, but she did not dare to make any alteration. 'Good-bye,'  she said, and mounted as lightly and airily as a bubble through the  water.    The sun had just set when her head rose above the water, but the clouds  were still lighted up with a rosy and golden splendour, and the evening  star sparkled in the soft pink sky, the air was mild and fresh, and the  sea as calm as a millpond. A big three-masted ship lay close by with  only a single sail set, for there was not a breath of wind, and the  sailors were sitting about the rigging, on the cross-trees, and at the  mast-heads. There was music and singing on board, and as the evening  closed in hundreds of gaily coloured lanterns were lighted--they looked  like the flags of all nations waving in the air. The little mermaid swam  right up to the cabin windows, and every time she was lifted by the  swell she could see through the transparent panes crowds of gaily  dressed people. The handsomest of them all was the young prince with  large dark eyes; he could not be much more than sixteen, and all these  festivities were in honour of his birthday. The sailors danced on deck,  and when the prince appeared among them hundreds of rockets were let off  making it as light as day, and frightening the little mermaid so much  that she had to dive under the water. She soon ventured up again, and it  was just as if all the stars of heaven were falling in showers round  about her. She had never seen such magic fires. Great suns whirled  round, gorgeous fire-fish hung in the blue air, and all was reflected  in the calm and glassy sea. It was so light on board the ship that every  little rope could be seen, and the people still better. Oh, how handsome  the prince was! how he laughed and smiled as he greeted his guests,  while the music rang out in the quiet night.    It got quite late, but the little mermaid could not take her eyes off  the ship and the beautiful prince. The coloured lanterns were put out,  no more rockets were sent up, and the cannon had ceased its thunder, but  deep down in the sea there was a dull murmuring and moaning sound.  Meanwhile she was rocked up and down on the waves, so that she could  look into the cabin; but the ship got more and more way on, sail after  sail was filled by the wind, the waves grew stronger, great clouds  gathered, and it lightened in the distance. Oh, there was going to be a  fearful storm! and soon the sailors had to shorten sail. The great ship  rocked and rolled as she dashed over the angry sea, the black waves rose  like mountains, high enough to overwhelm her, but she dived like a swan  through them and rose again and again on their towering crests. The  little mermaid thought it a most amusing race, but not so the sailors.  The ship creaked and groaned; the mighty timbers bulged and bent under  the heavy blows; the water broke over the decks, snapping the main mast  like a reed; she heeled over on her side, and the water rushed into the  hold.    Now the little mermaid saw that they were in danger, and she had for  her own sake to beware of the floating beams and wreckage. One moment it  was so pitch dark that she could not see at all, but when the lightning  flashed it became so light that she could see all on board. Every man  was looking out for his own safety as best he could; but she more  particularly followed the young prince with her eyes, and when the ship  went down she saw him sink in the deep sea. At first she was quite  delighted, for now he was coming to be with her, but then she remembered  that human beings could not live under water, and that only if he were  dead could he go to her father's palace. No! he must not die; so she  swam towards him all among the drifting beams and planks, quite  forgetting that they might crush her. She dived deep down under the  water, and came up again through the waves, and at last reached the  young prince just as he was becoming unable to swim any further in the  stormy sea. His limbs were numbed, his beautiful eyes were closing, and  he must have died if the little mermaid had not come to the rescue. She  held his head above the water and let the waves drive them whithersoever  they would.    By daybreak all the storm was over, of the ship not a trace was to be  seen; the sun rose from the water in radiant brilliance, and his rosy  beams seemed to cast a glow of life into the prince's cheeks, but his  eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed his fair and lofty brow, and  stroked back the dripping hair; it seemed to her that he was like the  marble statue in her little garden; she kissed him again and longed that  he might live.    At last she saw dry land before her, high blue mountains on whose  summits the white snow glistened as if a flock of swans had settled  there; down by the shore were beautiful green woods, and in the  foreground a church or temple, she did not quite know which, but it was  a building of some sort. Lemon and orange trees grew in the garden, and  lofty palms stood by the gate. At this point the sea formed a little bay  where the water was quite calm, but very deep, right up to the cliffs;  at their foot was a strip of fine white sand to which she swam with the  beautiful prince, and laid him down on it, taking great care that his  head should rest high up in the warm sunshine.    The bells now began to ring in the great white building, and a number of  young maidens came into the garden. Then the little mermaid swam further  off behind some high rocks and covered her hair and breast with foam, so  that no one should see her little face, and then she watched to see who  would discover the poor prince.    [Illustration: _His limbs were numbed, his beautiful eyes were closing,  and he must have died if the little mermaid had not come to the  rescue._]    It was not long before one of the maidens came up to him. At first she  seemed quite frightened, but only for a moment, and then she fetched  several others, and the mermaid saw that the prince was coming to life,  and that he smiled at all those around him, but he never smiled at her.  You see he did not know that she had saved him. She felt so sad  that when he was led away into the great building she dived sorrowfully  into the water and made her way home to her father's palace.    Always silent and thoughtful, she became more so now than ever. Her  sisters often asked her what she had seen on her first visit to the  surface, but she never would tell them anything.    Many an evening and many a morning she would rise to the place where she  had left the prince. She saw the fruit in the garden ripen, and then  gathered, she saw the snow melt on the mountain-tops, but she never saw  the prince, so she always went home still sadder than before. At home  her only consolation was to sit in her little garden with her arms  twined round the handsome marble statue which reminded her of the  prince. It was all in gloomy shade now, as she had ceased to tend her  flowers, and the garden had become a neglected wilderness of long stalks  and leaves entangled with the branches of the tree.    At last she could not bear it any longer, so she told one of her  sisters, and from her it soon spread to the others, but to no one else  except to one or two other mermaids who only told their dearest friends.  One of these knew all about the prince; she had also seen the  festivities on the ship; she knew where he came from and where his  kingdom was situated.    'Come, little sister!' said the other princesses, and, throwing their  arms round each other's shoulders, they rose from the water in a long  line, just in front of the prince's palace.    It was built of light yellow glistening stone, with great marble  staircases, one of which led into the garden. Magnificent gilded cupolas  rose above the roof, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#14)"],[1,"the best possible specimens of the most important  types, special emphasis on British arms after 1700 and American arms  after 1800. What I'm interested in is the evolution of the pistol. I have  a couple of wheel locks, to start with, and three miguelet-locks and an  Italian snaphaunce. Then I have a few early flintlocks, and a number of  mid-eighteenth-century types, and some late flintlocks and percussion  types. And about twenty Colts, and so on through percussion revolvers and  early cartridge types to some modern arms, including a few World War II  arms.\"    \"I see; about the same idea Lane Fleming had,\" Pierre said. \"I collect  personal combat-arms, firearms and edge-weapons. Arms that either  influenced fighting techniques, or were developed to meet special combat  conditions. From what you say, you're mainly interested in the way  firearms were designed and made; I'm interested in the conditions under  which they were used. And Adam Trehearne, who'll be here shortly,  collects pistols and a few long-arms in wheel lock, proto-flintlock and  early flintlock, to 1700. And Philip Cabot collects U.S. Martials,  flintlock to automatic, and also enemy and Allied Army weapons from all  our wars. And Colin MacBride collects nothing but Colts. Odd how a Scot,  who's only been in this country twenty years, should become interested  in so distinctively American a type.\"    \"And I collect anything I can sell at a profit, from Chinese matchlocks  to tommy-guns,\" Karen Lawrence interjected, coming into the room with Dot  Gresham.    Pierre grinned. \"Karen is practically a unique specimen herself; the only  general-antique dealer I've ever seen who doesn't hate the sight of a  gun-collector.\"    \"That's only because I'm crazy enough to want to marry one,\" the  girl dealer replied. \"Of all the miserly, unscrupulous, grasping  characters ...\" She expressed a doubt that the average gun-collector  would pay more than ten cents to see his Lord and Savior riding to hounds  on a Bren-carrier. \"They don't give a hoot whose grandfather owned what,  and if anything's battered up a little, they don't think it looks quaint,  they think it looks lousy. And they've never heard of inflation; they  think arms ought still to sell for the sort of prices they brought at the  old Mark Field sale, back in 1911.\"    \"What were you looking at?\" Dot asked Rand, then glanced at the musket in  Pierre's hands. \"Oh, Priscilla.\"    Karen laughed. \"Dot not only knows everything in the collection; she  knows it by name. Dot, show Colonel Rand Hester Prynne.\"    \"Hester coming up,\" Gresham's daughter said, catching another musket out  of the same rack from which Pierre had gotten the matchlock and passing  it over to Rand. He grasped the heavy piece, approving of the easy,  instinctive way in which the girl had handled it. \"Look on the barrel,\"  she told him. \"On top, right at the breech.\"    The gun was a flintlock, or rather, a dog-lock; sure enough, stamped on  the breech was the big \"A\" of the Company of Workmen Armorers of London,  the seventeenth-century gunmakers' guild.    \"That's right,\" he nodded. \"That's Hester Prynne, all right; the first  American girl to make her letter.\"    There were footsteps in the hall outside, and male voices.    \"Adam and Colin,\" Pierre recognized them before they entered.    Both men were past fifty. Colin MacBride was a six-foot black Highlander;  black eyes, black hair, and a black weeping-willow mustache, from under  which a stubby pipe jutted. Except when he emptied it of ashes and  refilled it, it was a permanent fixture of his weather-beaten face.  Trehearne was somewhat shorter, and fair; his sandy mustache, beginning  to turn gray at the edges, was clipped to micrometric exactness.    They shook hands with Rand, who set Hester back in her place. Trehearne  took the matchlock out of Pierre's hands and looked at it wistfully.    \"Some chaps have all the luck,\" he commented. \"What do you think of it,  Mr. Rand?\" Pierre, who had made the introductions, had respected the  detective's present civilian status. \"Or don't you collect long-arms?\"    \"I don't collect them, but I'm interested in anything that'll shoot.  That's a good one. Those things are scarce, too.\"    \"Yes. You'll find a hundred wheel locks for every matchlock, and yet  there must have been a hundred matchlocks made for every wheel lock.\"    \"Matchlocks were cheap, and wheel locks were expensive,\" MacBride  suggested. He spoke with the faintest trace of Highland accent.  \"Naturally, they got better care.\"    \"It would take a Scot to think of that,\" Karen said. \"Now, you take a  Scot who collects guns, and you have something!\"    \"That's only part of it,\" Rand said. \"I believe that by the last quarter  of the seventeenth century, most of the matchlocks that were lying around  had been scrapped, and the barrels used in making flintlocks. Hester  Prynne, over there, could easily have started her career as a matchlock.  And then, a great many matchlocks went into the West African slave and  ivory trade, and were promptly ruined by the natives.\"    \"Yes, and I seem to recall having seen Spanish and French miguelet  muskets that looked as though they had been altered directly from  matchlock, retaining the original stock and even the original  lock-plate,\" Trehearne added.    \"So have I, come to think of it.\" Rand stole a glance at his wrist-watch.  It was nine five; he was wishing Stephen Gresham would put in an  appearance.    MacBride and Trehearne joined Pierre and the girls in showing him  Gresham's collection; evidently they all knew it almost as well as their  own. After a while, Irene Gresham ushered in Philip Cabot. He, too, was  past middle age, with prematurely white hair and a thin, scholarly face.  According to Hollywood type-casting, he might have been a professor, or a  judge, or a Boston Brahmin, but never a stockbroker.    Irene Gresham wanted to know what everybody wanted to drink. Rand wanted  Bourbon and plain water; MacBride voted for Jamaica rum; Trehearne and  Cabot favored brandy and soda, and Pierre and the girls wanted Bacardi  and Coca-Cola.    \"And Stephen'll want rye and soda, when he gets here,\" Irene said. \"Come  on, girls; let's rustle up the drinks.\"    Before they returned, Stephen Gresham came in, lighting a cigar. It was  just nine twenty-two.    \"Well, I see everybody's here,\" he said. \"No; where's Karen?\"    Pierre told him. A few minutes later the women returned, carrying bottles  and glasses; when the flurry of drink-mixing had subsided, they all sat  down.    \"Let's get the business over first,\" Gresham suggested. \"I suppose you've  gone over the collection already, Jeff?\"    \"Yes, and first of all, I want to know something. When was the last that  any of you saw it?\"    Gresham and Pierre had been in Fleming's gunroom just two days before the  fatal \"accident.\"    \"And can you tell me if the big Whitneyville Colt was still there, then?\"  Rand asked. \"Or the Rappahannock Forge, or the Collier flintlock, or the  Hall?\"    \"Why, of course ... My God, aren't they there now?\" Gresham demanded.    Rand shook his head. \"And if Fleming still had them two days before he  was killed, then somebody's been weeding out the collection since. Doing  it very cleverly, too,\" he added. \"You know how that stuff's arranged,  and how conspicuous a missing pistol would be. Well, when I was going  over the collection, I found about two dozen pieces of the most utter  trash, things Lane Fleming wouldn't have allowed in the house, all  hanging where some really good item ought to have been.\" He took a paper  from his pocket and read off a list of the dubious items, interpolating  comments on the condition, and a list of the real rarities which Gresham  had mentioned the day before, which were now missing.    \"All that good stuff was there the last time I saw the collection,\"  Gresham said. \"What do you say, Pierre?\"    \"I had the Hall pistol in my hands,\" Pierre said. \"And I remember looking  at the Rappahannock Forge.\"    Trehearne broke in to ask how many English dog-locks there were, and if  the snaphaunce Highlander and the big all-steel wheel lock were still  there. At the same time, Cabot was inquiring about the Springfield 1818  and the Virginia Manufactory pistols.    \"I'll have a complete, itemized list in a few days,\" Rand said. \"In the  meantime, I'd like a couple of you to look at the collection and help me  decide what's missing. I'm going to try to catch the thief, and then get  at the fence through him.\"    \"Think Rivers might have gotten the pistols?\" Gresham asked. \"He's the  crookedest dealer I know of.\"    \"He's the crookedest dealer anybody knows of,\" Rand amended. \"The only  thing, he's a little too anxious to buy the collection, for somebody  who's just skimmed off the cream.\"    \"Ten thousand dollars isn't much in the way of anxiety,\" Cabot said. \"I'd  call that a nominal bid, to avoid suspicion.\"    \"The dope's changed a little on that.\" Rand brought him up to date.  \"Rivers's offer is now twenty-five thousand.\"    There was a stunned hush, followed by a gust of exclamations.    \"Guid Lorrd!\" The Scots accent fairly curdled on Colin MacBride's tongue.  \"We canna go over that!\"    \"I'm afraid not; twenty would be about our limit,\" Gresham agreed. \"And  with the best items gone ...\" He shrugged.    Pierre and Karen were looking at each other in blank misery; their dream  of establishing themselves in the arms business had blown up in their  faces.    \"Oh, he's talking through his hat!\" Cabot declared. \"He just hopes we'll  lose interest, and then he'll buy what's left of the collection for a  song.\"    \"Maybe he knows the collection's been robbed,\" Trehearne suggested. \"That  would let him out, later. He'd accuse you or the Fleming estate of  holding out the best pieces, and then offer to take what's left for about  five thousand.\"    \"Well, that would be presuming that he knows the collection has been"]]]
