The terms employed to denote this species (\"Song-form\" or \"Part-form\")  do not signify that the music is necessarily to be a vocal composition  of that variety known as the \"Song\"; or that it is to consist of  several voices (for which the appellation \"parts\" is commonly used).  They indicate simply a certain _grade_,--not a specific variety,--of  form; an intermediate grade between the smallest class (like brief  hymn-tunes, for example), and the largest class (like complete  sonata-movements).  An excellent {84} type of this grade of Form is  found in the Songs Without Words of Mendelssohn, the Mazurkas of  Chopin, and works of similar extent.    The word Part (written always with a capital in these lessons) denotes,  then, one of these larger sections.  The design of the Part-forms was  so characteristic of the early German _lied_, and is so common in the  _song_ of all eras, that the term \"Song-form\" seems a peculiarly  appropriate designation, irrespective of the vocal or instrumental  character of the composition.    The student will perceive that it is the smallest class of forms--the  Phrase-forms,--embracing the phrase, period and double-period, to which  the preceding chapters have been devoted.  These are the designs which,  as a general rule, _contain only one decisive perfect cadence_, and  that at the end; and which, therefore, though interrupted by  semicadences, _are continuous and coherent_, because the semicadence  merely interrupts, and does not sever, the continuity of the sentence.  (This grade of forms might be called One-Part forms).      THE PARTS.--If we inquire into the means employed, in the larger  Part-forms, to effect the division of the whole into its broader Parts,  we find that the prime factors, here again, are Cadence and Melody.  The strongest sign of the consummation of a Part is a _decisive perfect  cadence_, resting, as usual, upon the tonic harmony of the chosen key;  a cadence sufficiently emphatic to interrupt the closer cohesion of the  phrases which, precede, and bring them, as completed Part, to a  conclusion.  Such a cadence, marking the end of the First Part, may be  verified in Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, No. 23, measure 15; No.  3, measure 29 (at the double-bar,--a sign which frequently appears at  the termination of Part One); No. 20, measure 21; No. 27, measure 12;  No. 34, measure 10.    Another indication of the Part-form is a palpable change in melodic  character in passing from one Part into the next; sufficient to denote  a more striking \"new beginning\" than marks the announcement of a new  _phrase_ only.  The change, however, is as a rule _not very marked_; it  is sometimes, in fact, so slight as to be no more than simply palpable,  though scarcely definable on the page.  For these divisions are, after  all, the several \"Parts\" of one and the same song-form, and, therefore,  any such radical change in melodic or rhythmic character, or in general  style, as would make each Part appear to be a _wholly independent_  musical idea (subject or theme), would be manifestly inconsistent.    Generally, both these factors (cadence and melody) unite to define the  end of one Part and the beginning of the next.  Should either one be  feeble, or absent, the other factor will be all the more pronounced.  Thus, the cadence of Part One may be less decisive, if the change in  melodic character at the beginning of Part Two is well marked; this is  seen in No. 33, measure 12.  The reverse--a strong cadence and but  little melodic change,--in No. 13, measure 20.      THE FIRST PART.--Part One may be designed as period, double-period, or  phrase-group; sometimes, though very rarely, as single phrase,  repeated.  It ends, usually, with a strong perfect cadence on the tonic  chord of the original key, or of some related key (that is, one whose  _signature_ closely resembles that of the original key).  An  introductory phrase, or independent prelude, may precede it.      THE SECOND PART.--Part Two, as intimated, is likely to begin with a  more or less palpable change of melodic character,--by no means is this  always the case.  It may be designed, also, as period, double-period,  or phrase-group, and is somewhat likely to be a little longer (more  extended) than Part One.  A concluding section (called codetta if  small, coda if more elaborate) often follows, after a decided perfect  cadence in the original key has definitely concluded the Part.    The following is one of the simplest examples of the Two-Part Song-form  (a German _lied_ by Silcher):--    [Illustration: Example 52.  Fragment of German _lied_.]      The whole embraces four phrases, and might, for that reason, be  mistaken for a double-period.  But the _strong perfect cadence_ at the  end of the first period (reinforced by the repetition), and the  contrasting melodic formation of the second period, so separate and  distinguish the two periods as to make them independent \"Parts\" of the  whole.  It is not one \"double-period,\" but _two fairly distinct  periods_.  The first cadence (in measure 4) has again, strictly  speaking, the elements of a perfect cadence, but, like others we have  seen (Exs. 50, 51), too near the beginning to possess any plausible  concluding power.    A somewhat similar specimen may be found in the theme of Mendelssohn's  Variations in D minor, op. 54, which see.  Each Part is a regular  period-form, with correct semicadence and perfect cadence.  The problem  of \"agreement and independence\" in the relation of Part II to Part I is  admirably solved; it is a masterly model of well-matched Unity and  Variety, throughout.    For a longer and more elaborate example, see No. 6 of the Songs Without  Words, in which, by the way, the principle of enlargement by the  addition of an independent prefix (introduction) and affix (coda) is  also illustrated:--    First number the forty-six measures with pencil.    The first cadence occurs in measure 7, and marks the end of the  prelude.  Part I begins in measure 8.  In measure 11 there is a  semicadence, at end of Antecedent phrase; in measure 17, a strong  perfect cadence, which, in connection with the subsequent change of  melodic form, distinctly defines the end of Part I (period-form,  extended).  Part II therefore begins in measure 18.  In measures 21,  25, 29, cadences occur, but none conclusive enough to close the Part.  This conclusion takes place, however, in measure 34.  Part II proves to  be a double-period.  A coda begins in measure 35; its first members  resemble the first phrase of Part I.  In measure 40 another section of  the coda begins, borrowed from the prelude.  For exhaustive technical  details of the Two-Part Song-form, see the HOMOPHONIC FORMS, Chapters 9  and 10.      LESSON 9.--Analyze the following examples of the Two-Part Song-form.  Define the form of each Part, marking and classifying all cadences; and  indicate introductions and codas (or codettas), if present.  _The first  step in the analysis of these forms is to divide the whole composition  into its Parts, by defining the end of Part One_.  The next step is to  define the beginning of Part One, and end of Part Two, by separating  the introduction and coda (if present) from the body of the form.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN BIPARTITE AND TRIPARTITE FORMS.--We learned, in the  preceding chapter, that the Two-Part Song-form is a composition of  rather brief extent, with so decisive a perfect cadence in its course  as to divide it, in a marked manner, into two separate and fairly  individual sections or \"Parts.\"    Between this and the next higher form,--that with _three_ such  Parts,--there is a distinction far more essential and characteristic  than that of mere extent; a distinction that does not rest simply upon  the number of Parts which they respectively contain.  Each of the two  classes of formal design, the Two-Part and the Three-Part, embodies a  peculiar structural idea; and it is the evidence of these respective  ideas,--the true content of the musical form,--which determines the  species.  The \"number\" of sections is, in this connection, nothing more  than the external index of the inherent idea.    The Two-Part forms embody the idea of _progressive growth_.  To the  first Part, a second Part (of similar or related melodic contents) is  added, in coherent and logical succession.  It should not be, and in  good clear form it is not, a purely numerical enlargement, for the  association of the second Part with a foregoing one answers the  purposes of confirmation and of balance, and is supposed to be so  effectuated as to institute and maintain unity of style, and some  degree of progressive development.  But the second Part, in this  bipartite design, does little or nothing more, after all, than thus to  project the musical thought on outward in a straight line (or along  parallel lines) to a conclusion more or less distant from the  starting-point,--from the melodic members which constitute the actual  germ, or the \"text\" of the entire musical discourse.  A very desirable,  not to say vital, condition is therefore {90} lacking, in the Two-Part  forms; namely, the corroboration of this melodic germ by an emphatic  return to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#14)"],[1,"form than the delineation of the bow and arrows, as well as being more  in keeping with the general rendering of the tradition.    MID[-E]/WIG[^A]N.    Initiation into the Mid[-e]/wiwin or Mid[-e]/ Society is, at this time,  performed during the latter part of summer. The ceremonies are performed  in public, as the structure in which they are conducted is often loosely  constructed of poles with intertwined branches and leaves, leaving the  top almost entirely exposed, so that there is no difficulty in observing  what may transpire within. Furthermore, the ritual is unintelligible to  the uninitiated, and the important part of the necessary information is  given to the candidate in a preceptor's wig/iwam.    To present intelligibly a description of the ceremonial of initiation as  it occurred at White Earth, Minnesota, it will be necessary to first  describe the structure in which it occurs, as well as the sweat lodge  with which the candidate has also to do.      [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Diagram of Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n of the first    degree.]    The Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, i.e., Mid[-e]/wig/iwam, or, as it is generally  designated \"Grand Medicine Lodge,\" is usually built in an open grove or  clearing; it is a structure measuring about 80 feet in length by 20 in  width, extending east and west with the main entrance toward that point  of the compass at which the sun rises. The walls consist of poles and  saplings from 8 to 10 feet high, firmly planted in the ground, wattled  with short branches and twigs with leaves. In the east and west walls  are left open spaces, each about 4 feet wide, used as entrances to the  inclosure. From each side of the opening the wall-like structure extends  at right angles to the end wall, appearing like a short hallway leading  to the inclosure, and resembles double doors opened outward. Fig. 10  represents a ground plan of the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, while Fig. 11 shows an  interior view. Saplings thrown across the top of the structure serve as  rafters, upon which are laid branches with leaves, and pieces of bark,  to sufficiently shade the occupants from the rays of the sun. Several  saplings extend across the inclosure near the top, while a few are  attached to these so as to extend longitudinally, from either side of  which presents of blankets, etc., may be suspended. About 10 feet from  the main entrance a large flattened stone, measuring more than a foot in  diameter, is placed upon the ground. This is used when subjecting to  treatment a patient; and at a corresponding distance from the western  door is planted the sacred Mid[-e]/ post of cedar, that for the first  degree being about 7 feet in height and 6 or 8 inches in diameter. It is  painted red, with a band of green 4 inches wide around the top. Upon the  post is fixed the stuffed body of an owl. Upon that part of the floor  midway between the stone and the Mid[-e]/ post is spread a blanket, upon  which the gifts and presents to the society are afterward deposited.  A short distance from each of the outer angles of the structure are  planted cedar or pine trees, each about 10 feet in height.      [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Interior of Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n.]    About a hundred yards east of the main entrance is constructed a  wig/iwam or sweat lodge, to be used by the candidate, both to take his  vapor baths and to receive final instructions from his preceptor.    This wig/iwam is dome-shaped measures about 10 feet in diameter and 6  feet high in the middle, with an opening at the top which can be readily  covered with a piece of bark. The framework of the structure consists of  saplings stuck into the ground, the tops being bent over to meet others  from the opposite side. Other thin saplings are then lashed horizontally  to the upright ones so as to appear like hoops, decreasing in size as  the summit is reached. They are secured by using strands of basswood  bark. The whole is then covered with pieces of birchbark--frequently the  bark of the pine is used--leaving a narrow opening on the side facing  the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n, which may be closed with an adjustable flap of  bark or blankets.    The space between the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n and the sweat lodge must be kept  clear of other temporary shelters, which might be placed there by some  of the numerous visitors attending the ceremonies.      FIRST DEGREE.    PREPARATORY INSTRUCTION.    When the candidate's application for reception into the Mid[-e]/wiwin  has been received by one of the officiating priests, he calls upon the  three assisting Mid[-e]/, inviting them to visit him at his own wig/iwam  at a specified time. When the conference takes place, tobacco, which has  been previously furnished by the candidate, is distributed and a smoke  offering made to Ki/tshi Man/id[-o], to propitiate his favor in the  deliberations about to be undertaken. The host then explains the object  of the meeting, and presents to his auditors an account of the  candidate's previous life; he recounts the circumstances of his fast and  dreams, and if the candidate is to take the place of a lately deceased  son who had been prepared to receive the degree, the fact is mentioned,  as under such circumstances the forms would be different from the  ordinary method of reception into the society. The subject of presents  and gifts to the individual members of the society, as well as those  intended to be given as a fee to the officiating priests, is also  discussed; and lastly, if all things are favorable to the applicant, the  selection of an instructor or preceptor is made, this person being  usually appointed from among these four priests.    When the conference is ended the favorable decision is announced to the  applicant, who acknowledges his pleasure by remitting to each of the  four priests gifts of tobacco. He is told what instructor would be most  acceptable to them, when he repairs to the wig/iwam of the person  designated and informs him of his wish and the decision of the Mid[-e]/  council.    The designated preceptor arranges with his pupil to have certain days  upon which the latter is to call and receive instruction and acquire  information. The question of remuneration being settled, tobacco is  furnished at each sitting, as the Mid[-e]/ never begins his lecture  until after having made a smoke-offering, which is done by taking a  whiff and pointing the stem to the east; then a whiff, directing the  stem to the south; another whiff, directing the stem to the west; then a  whiff and a similar gesture with the stem to the north; another whiff is  taken slowly and with an expression of reverence, when the stem is  pointed forward and upward as an offering to Ki/tshi Man/id[-o]; and  finally, after taking a similar whiff, the stem is pointed forward and  downward toward the earth as an offering to Nok[-o]/mis, the grandmother  of the universe, and to those who have passed before. After these  preliminaries, the candidate receives at each meeting only a small  amount of information, because the longer the instruction is continued  daring the season before the meeting at which it is hoped the candidate  may be admitted the greater will be the fees; and also, in order that  the instruction may be looked upon with awe and reverence, most of the  information imparted is frequently a mere repetition, the ideas being  clothed in ambiguous phraseology. The Mid[-e]/ drum (Fig. 12 _a_)  differs from the drum commonly used in dances (Fig. 12 _b_) in the fact  that it is cylindrical, consisting of an elongated kettle or wooden  vessel, or perhaps a section of the hollow trunk of a tree about 10  inches in diameter and from 18 to 20 inches in length, over both ends of  which rawhide is stretched while wet, so that upon drying the membrane  becomes hard and tense, producing, when beaten, a very hard, loud tone,  which may be heard at a great distance.      [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Ojibwa drums.]    Frequently, however, water is put into the bottom of the drum and the  drum-head stretched across the top in a wet state, which appears to  intensify the sound very considerably.    The peculiar and special properties of the drum are described to the  applicant; that it was at first the gift of Ki/tshi Man/id[-o], who gave  it through the intercession of Mi/nab[-o]/zho; that it is used to invoke  the presence of the Mid[-e]/ Man/id[-o]s, or sacred spirits, when  seeking direction as to information desired, success, etc.; that it is  to be employed at the side of the sick to assist in the expulsion or  exorcism of evil man/id[-o]s who may possess the body of the sufferer;  and that it is to be used in the. Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n during the initiation  of new members or the advancement of a Mid[-e]/ from a degree to a  higher one.      [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Mid[-e]/ rattle.]    The properties of the rattle are next enumerated and recounted, its  origin is related, and its uses explained. It is used at the side of a  patient and has even more power in the expulsion of evil demons than the  drum. The rattle is also employed in some of the sacred songs as an  accompaniment, to accentuate certain notes and words. There are two  forms used, one consisting of a cylindrical tin box filled with grains  of corn or other seeds (Fig. 13), the other being a hollow gourd also  filled with seed (Fig. 14). In both of these the handle passes entirely  through the rattle case.      [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Mid[-e]/ rattle.]    In a similar manner the remaining gifts of Mi/nab[-o]/zho are instanced  and their properties extolled.    The m[-i]/gis, a small white shell (Cypraea moneta L.) is next extracted  from the Mid[-e]/ sack, or pinji/gus[^a]n/. This is explained as being  the sacred emblem of the Mid[-e]/wiwin, the reason therefor being given  in the account of the several traditions presented in connection with  Pls. III, IV, and VIII.
