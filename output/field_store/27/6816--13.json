Not even Mr. Gokhale with  all his moral and intellectual force could stem the flowing tide of  Tilak's popularity in the Deccan; and in order not to be swept under he  was perhaps often compelled like many other Moderates to go further than  his own judgment can have approved. Tilak commanded the allegiance of  barristers and pleaders, schoolmasters and professors, clerks in  Government offices--in fact, of the large majority of the so-called  educated classes, largely recruited amongst his own and other Brahman  castes; and his propaganda had begun to filter down not only to the  coolies in the cities, but even to the rayats, or at least the head-men  in the villages.    More than that. From the Deccan, as we have already seen in his  relations with the Indian National Congress, his influence was projected  far and wide. His house was a place of pilgrimage for the disaffected  from all parts of India. His prestige as a Brahman of the Brahmans and a  pillar of orthodoxy, in spite of the latitude of the views which he  sometimes expressed in regard to the depressed castes, his reputation  for profound learning in the philosophies both of the West and of the  East, his trenchant style, his indefatigable activity, the glamour of  his philanthropy, his accessibility to high and low, his many acts of  genuine kindliness, the personal magnetism which, without any great  physical advantages, he exerted upon most of those who came in contact  with him, and especially upon the young, combined to equip him more  fully than any other Indian politician for the leadership of a  revolutionary movement.    The appeal which Tilak made to the Hindus was twofold. He taught them,  on the one hand, that India, and especially Maharashtra, the land of the  Mahrattas, had been happier and better and more prosperous under a Hindu  _raj_ than it had ever been or could ever be under the rule of alien  \"demons\"; and that if the British _raj_ had at one time served some  useful purpose in introducing India to the scientific achievements of  Western civilisation, it had done so at ruinous cost, both material and  moral, to the Indians whose wealth it had drained and whose social and  religious institutions it had undermined, and on the other hand he held  out to them the prospect that, if power were once restored to the  Brahmans, who had already learnt all that there was of good to be  learnt from the English, the golden age would return for gods and men.  That Tilak himself hardly believed in the possibility of overthrowing  British rule is more than probable, but what some Indians who knew him  well tell me he did believe was that the British could be driven or  wearied by a ceaseless and menacing agitation into gradually  surrendering to the Brahmans the reality of power, as did the later  Peshwas, and remaining content with the mere shadow of sovereignty. As  one of his organs blurted it out:--\"If the British yield all power to us  and retain only nominal control, we may yet be friends.\"    Such was the position when, on June 24, 1908, Tilak was arrested in  Bombay on charges connected with the publication in the _Kesari_ of  articles containing inflammatory comments on the Muzafferpur outrage, in  which Mrs. and Miss Kennedy had been killed by a bomb--the first of a  long list of similar outrages in Bengal. Not in the moment of first  excitement, but weeks afterwards, the _Kesari_ had commented on this  crime in terms which the Parsee Judge, Mr. Justice Davar, described in  his summing up as follows:--\"They are seething with sedition; they  preach violence; they speak of murders with approval; and the cowardly  and atrocious act of committing murders with bombs not only meets with  your approval, but you hail the advent of the bomb into India as if  something had come to India for its good.\" The bomb was extolled in  these articles as \"a kind of witchcraft, a charm, an amulet,\" and the  _Kesari_ delighted in showing that neither the \"supervision of the  police\" nor \"swarms of detectives\" could stop \"these simple playful  sports of science,\" Whilst professing to deprecate such methods, it  threw the responsibility upon Government, which allowed \"keen  disappointment to overtake thousands of intelligent persons who have  been awakened to the necessity of securing the rights of _Swaraj_.\"  Tilak spoke four whole days in his own defence--21-1/2 hours  altogether--but the jury returned a verdict of \"Guilty,\" and he was  sentenced to six years' transportation, afterwards commuted on account  of his age and health to simple imprisonment at Mandalay.    The prosecution of a man of Tilak's popularity and influence at a time  when neither the Imperial Government nor the Government of India had  realized the full danger of the situation was undoubtedly a grave  measure of which a weaker Government than that of Bombay under Sir  George Clarke might well have shirked the responsibility. There were  serious riots after the trial. From the moment of his arrest Tilak's  followers had put it about amongst the mill-hands that he was in prison  because he was their friend and had sought to obtain better pay for  them. Some of his supporters are said to have declared during the trial  that there would be a day's bloodshed for every year to which he might  be sentenced by the Court, and, as a matter of fact, he was sentenced to  six years' imprisonment and the riots lasted six days. The rioting  assumed at times a very threatening character. The European police  frequently had to use their revolvers, and the troops had several times  to fire in self-defence. But rigorous orders had been issued by the  authorities to avoid as far as possible the shedding of blood, and both  the police and the military forces exercised such steady self-restraint  that casualties were relatively few, and the violence of the mob never  vented itself upon the European population of the city. The gravity of  the disturbances, however, showed the extent and the lawless character  of the influence which Tilak had already acquired over the lower classes  in Bombay, and not merely over the turbulent mill-hands. In the heart of  the city many Hindu shops were closed \"out of sympathy with Tilak,\" and  the most violent rioting on one day occurred amongst the Bhattias and  Banias employed in the cloth market, who had hitherto been regarded as  very orderly and rather timid folk. The trouble in Bombay was certainly  not a sudden and spontaneous outburst of popular feeling. It bore  throughout the impress of careful and deliberate organization. By a  happy combination of sympathy and firmness Sir George Clarke had,  however, won the respect of the vast majority of the community, and  though he failed to secure the active support which he might have  expected from the \"moderates,\" there were few of them who did not  secretly approve and even welcome his action. Its effects were great and  enduring, for Tilak's conviction was a heavy blow--perhaps the heaviest  which has been dealt--to the forces of unrest, at least in the Deccan;  and some months later one of the organs of his party, the _Rashtramat_,  reviewing the occurrences of the year, was fain to admit that \"the  sudden removal of Mr. Tilak's towering personality threw the whole  province into dismay and unnerved the other leaders.\"    The agitation in the Deccan did not die out with Tilak's disappearance,  for he left his stamp upon a new generation, which he had educated and  trained. More than a year after Tilak had been removed to Mandalay, his  doctrines bore fruit in the murder of Mr. Jackson, the Collector of  Nasik--a murder which, in the whole lamentable record of political  crimes in India, stands out in many ways pre-eminently infamous and  significant. The chief executive officer of a large district, \"Pundit\"  Jackson, as he was familiarly called, was above all a scholar, devoted  to Indian studies, and his sympathy with all forms of Indian thought was  as genuine as his acquaintance with them was profound. His affection for  the natives was such as, perhaps, to blind him to their faults, and like  the earliest victims of the Indian Mutiny he entertained to the very  last an almost childlike confidence in the loyalty of the whole people.  Only a few days before his death he expressed his conviction that  disaffection had died out in Nasik, and that he could go anywhere, and  at any hour without the slightest risk of danger. That he was very  generally respected and even beloved by many there can be no doubt, and  there is no reason to question the sincerity of the regrets which found  expression on the announcement of his impending transfer to Bombay in a  series of farewell entertainments, both public and private, by the  inhabitants of the city. Only two days before the fatal 21st of  December, an ode in Marathi addressed to him at a reception organized by  the Municipal Council dwelt specially upon his gentleness of soul and  kindliness of manner.    Yet this was the man whom the fanatical champions of Indian Nationalism  in the Deccan singled out for assassination as a protest against British  tyranny. The trial of the actual murderer and of those who aided and  abetted him abundantly demonstrated the cold-blooded premeditation which  characterized this crime. Numerous consultations had taken place ever  since the previous September between the murderer and his accomplices as  to the manner and time of the deed. It was repeatedly postponed because  the accomplices who belonged to Nasik were afraid of rendering active  assistance which might compromise them, though they were ready enough to  arm the hand of the wretched youth from Aurungabad who had volunteered  to strike the blow.

There are some pages of this sort in  _Christus_.    But there are beautiful and wonderful things in this vast work. If we  regret that the author lingered too long in his imitation of the  _Pifferari_ of the Roman campagna, on the other hand, we are delighted  by the symphonic interlude _Les Bergers a la Creche_. It is very simple,  but in an inimitable simplicity of taste which is the secret of great  artists alone. It is surprising that this interlude does not appear in  the repertoire of all concerts.    The Dante symphony has not established itself in the repertoires as has  the Faust symphony. It was performed for the first time in Paris at a  concert I organized and managed at a time when Liszt's works were  distrusted. Along with the Dante symphony we had the Andante (Gretchen)  from the Faust symphony, the symphonic poem _Fest Kloenge_, a charming  work which is never played now, and still other works. It would be hard  to imagine all the opposition I had to overcome in giving that concert.  There was the hostility of the public, the ill-will of the  Theatre-Italien which rented me its famous hall but which sullenly  opposed a proper announcement of the concert, the insubordination of the  orchestra, the demands of the singers for more pay--they imagined that  Liszt would pay the expenses--and, finally, complete--and expected  failure. My only object was to lay a foundation for the future, nothing  more. In spite of everything I managed to get a creditable performance  of the Dante symphony and I had the pleasure of hearing it for the first  time.    The first part (the Inferno) is wonderfully impressive with its  _Francesca da Rimini_ interlude, in which burn all the fires of Italian  passion. The second part (Purgatory and Paradise) combines the most  intense and poignant charm. It contains a fugue episode of unsurpassed  beauty.    _Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne_ is, perhaps, the best of the famous  symphonic poems. The author was inspired by Victor Hugo's poetry and  reproduced its spirit admirably. When will this typical work appear in  the concert repertoires? When will orchestra conductors get tired of  presenting the three or four Wagnerian works they repeat _ad nauseum_,  when they can be heard at the Opera under better conditions, and  Schubert's insignificant _Unfinished Symphony_.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Christus_ oratorio was given at the first concert of the festival  at Heidelberg. It lasted three hours and a half and is so long that I  would not dare to advise concert managers to try such an adventure. The  performance was sublime. It was given in a newly constructed square  hall. Cavaille-Coll, who knew acoustics, used to advise the square hall  for concerts but nobody would listen to him. Three hundred chorus  singers, many from a distance, were supported by an orchestra that was  large, but, in my opinion, insufficient to stand up against this mass of  voices. Furthermore, the orchestra was placed below the level of the  stage, as in a theatre, while the voices sounded freely above. Two  harps, one on the east side of the stage and one on the west, saw each  other from afar,--a pleasingly decorative device, but as annoying to the  ear as pleasing to the eye. The chorus and the four soloists--their task  was exceedingly arduous--triumphed completely over the difficulties of  this immense work and all the varied and delicate nuances were rendered  to perfection.    Liszt was far from professing the disdain for the limitations of the  human voice that Wagner and Berlioz did. On the contrary he treated it  as if it were a queen or a goddess, and it is to be regretted that his  tastes did not lead him to work for the stage. Parts of _Saint  Elisabeth_ show that he would have succeeded and the fashion of having  operas for the orchestra, accompanied by voices, which we enjoy to-day,  might have been avoided. He discovered a method, peculiarly his own, of  writing choruses. His manner has never been imitated, but it is  ingenious and has many advantages. The only trouble about it is that the  singers have to take care of details and shadings which is too often  the least of their worries. The German societies, where the members sing  for pleasure, and not for a salary, are careful to excess, if there can  be excess in such matters, and it is their great good fortune to be the  interpreters of choruses written in this manner.    It is impossible to give an analysis of this vast work here. We have  already spoken of the charming interlude, _Les Bergers a la Creche_.  This pastoral is followed by _Marche des Rois Mages_, a pretty piece,  but a little overdeveloped for its intrinsic worth. The vocal parts,  _Beatitudes_ and _Le Pater Noster_, would be more suitable in a church  than in a concert hall. Then come some most brilliant pages, _La Tempete  sur le lac de Thiberiade_, and _Le Mont des Oliviers_, with its baritone  solo, and finally, the _Stabat Mater_, where great beauties are combined  with terrible length. But nothing in the whole work impressed me more  than Christ's entrance to Jerusalem (orchestra, chorus, and soloist) for  the reading alone gives no idea of it. Here the author reached the  heights. That also describes the delightful effect of the children's  chorus singing in the distance _O Filii et Filiae_, harmonised with  perfect taste.    While I listened to this beautiful work, I could not help thinking of  the great oratorios which crowned Gounod's musical career so gloriously.  Liszt and Gounod differed entirely in their musical temperaments, yet in  their oratorios they met on common ground. In both there was the same  drawing away from the old forms of oratorio, the same search for realism  in the expression of the text in music, the same respect for Latin  prosody, and the same belief in simplicity of style. But while there is  renunciation in the simplicity of Liszt, who threw aside worldly finery  to wear the frock of a penitent, on the contrary Gounod appears to  return to his original bent with an almost holy joy. This is easily  explained. Liszt finished his life in a cassock, while Gounod began his  in one. So, despite Liszt's superior refinement, and putting aside  exceptional achievements, in this branch of art Gounod was the victor.  As there is an _odor di femina_ there is a _parfum d'eglise_, well known  to Catholics. Gounod's oratorios are impregnated with this, while it is  found in _Christus_ very, very feebly, if at all. The _Missa Solemnis_  must be examined to find it to any extent in Liszt's work.    All the necessary elements were combined at Heidelberg to produce a  magnificent production of Faust and Dante. The orchestra of more than  one hundred musicians was perfect. The period when the wind instruments  in Germany were wanting both in correctness and quality of sound has  passed. But the orchestra conductors have to be taken into account. In  our day these gentlemen are _virtuosi_. Their personalities are not  subservient to the music, but the music to them. It is the springboard  on which they perform and parade their all embracing personalities. They  add their own inventions to the author's meaning. Sometimes they draw  out the wind instruments so that the musicians have to cut a phrase at  the end to catch their breath; again they affect a mad and unrestrained  rapidity which allows time neither to play nor to hear the sounds. They  hurry or retard the movement for no reason besides their individual  caprice or because the author did not indicate them. They perpetrate  music of such a disorganized character that the musicians are utterly  bewildered, and hesitate in their entrances on account of their  inability to distinguish one measure from another.    The delightful _Purgatoire_ has become a deadly bore, and the enchanting  _Mephistopheles_ has been riddled as by a hailstorm. Familiarity with  such excesses made me particularly appreciative of the excellent  performance that Wolfrum, the musical director, obtained in the vast  _Christus_ concert.    Among the conductors was Richard Strauss who cannot be passed over  without a word. Certainly no one will hope to find moderation and  serenity in this artist or be surprised if he gives his temperament free  rein, and rides on to victory undisturbed by the ruins he leaves behind.  But he lacks neither intelligence nor elegance, and if he sometimes goes  too fast he never overemphasizes slowness. When he is conducting, we  need not fear the desert of Sahara where others sometimes lead us. Under  his direction _Tasso_ displayed all its wealth of resources and the  jewel-like _Mephisto-Walzer_ shone more brightly than ever before.    I can speak but briefly of the numerous soloists. We neither judge nor  compare such talents as those of Busoni, Friedheim, and Risler. We are  satisfied with admiring them. However, if a prize must be awarded, I  should give it to Risler for his masterly interpretation of the great  _Sonata in B minor_. He made the most of it in every way, in all its  power and in all its delicacy. When it is given in this way, it is one  of the finest sonatas imaginable. But such a performance is rare, for it  is beyond the average artist. The strength of an athlete, the lightness  of a bird, capriciousness, charm, and a perfect understanding of style  in general and of the style of this composer in particular are the  qualifications needed to perform this work. It is far too difficult for  most _virtuosi_, however talented they may be.    Among the women singers I shall only mention Madame Cahier from the  Viennese Opera. She is a great artist with a wonderful voice and her  interpretation of several _lieder_ made them wonderfully worth while.  Madame Cahier interpreted the part of Dalila at Vienna with Dalmores,  so it can easily be appreciated how much pleasure I took in hearing her.    A final"]]]
