A _phrase_ is a short musical thought (at least two measures in  length) closing with either a complete or an incomplete cadence. The  typical _phrase_ is four measures long. The two-measure _phrase_ is  often called _section_. The word _phrase_ as used in music terminology  corresponds with the same word as used in language study.    145. A _period_ is a little piece of music typically eight measures  long, either complete in itself or forming one of the clearly defined  divisions of a larger form. The _period_ (when complete in itself) is  the smallest monophonic form.    The essential characteristic of the _regular period_ is the fact that it  usually consists of two balanced phrases (often called _antecedent_ and  _consequent_ or _thesis_ and _antithesis_), the first phrase giving rise  to the feeling of incompleteness (by means of a cadence in another key,  deceptive cadence, etc.,) the second phrase giving the effect of  completeness by means of a definite cadence at the close.         The second half of the period is sometimes a literal       repetition of the first half, in all respects except the       cadence, but in many cases too it is a repetition of only one       of the elements--rhythm, intervals, or general outline. Figs.       58 and 59 show examples of both types. The principle almost       invariably holds that the simpler the music (cf. folk-tunes)       the more obvious the form of the period, while the more       complex the music, the less regular the period.    [Illustration: Fig. 58. MOZART]    [Illustration: Fig. 59. SCHUBERT]    146. The _primary forms_ are built up by combining two or more periods.    The _small two-part primary form_ (often called _song-form_ or  _Lied-form_) consists of two periods so placed that the second  constitutes a consequent or antithesis to the first. The second half of  this second period is often exactly the same as the second half of the  first period, thus binding the two periods together into absolute unity.  The theme of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony (Beethoven)  quoted below is a perfect example of this form. Other examples are  \"Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes,\" and \"The Last Rose of Summer.\"    [Illustration: BEETHOVEN]    The _small three-part primary form_ is like the two-part primary form  except that it has a section of contrasting material interpolated  between the two periods. This middle part is usually an eight-measure  phrase.    The _large two- and three-part primary forms_ usually have  sixteen-measure periods instead of eight-measure ones, but are otherwise  similar in construction.         These various _primary forms_ are used in constructing many       varieties of compositions, among them the _theme and       variations_, the _polka_, the _waltz_, the _march_, etc., as       well as most of the shorter movements in sonatas, quartets,       etc. They are used in vocal music also, but are less apt to be       regular here because the form of vocal music is largely       dependent upon the structure of the text.    147. A _theme_ is a fragment of melody used as the subject of a fugue,  as the basis of the development section in \"sonata form,\" etc. Sometimes  it is a complete tune (often in period form), on which variations are  made, as _e.g._, in the familiar _theme and variations_.    148. _Thematic development_ consists in taking a short theme (or several  short themes) and by means of transposition, interval expansion and  contraction, rhythmic augmentation and diminution, inversion, tonality  changes, etc., building out of it a lengthy composition or section of a  composition. Fig. 60 _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, and _f_ show how the theme  given in Fig. 60 (_a_) may be varied in a few of these ways. There are  hundreds of other fashions in which this same theme might be varied  without destroying its identity. For other examples of thematic  development see the development section of Sonata Op. 31, No. 3, as  analyzed in Appendix E. [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"Sec. 3\" in  original.]    [Illustration: Fig. 60.]         For further illustrations of development in the case of this       same theme, see--Christiani--The Principles of Expression in       Pianoforte playing, p. 144, ff. from which the foregoing       themes have been adapted.    149. A _rondo_ is an instrumental composition (in homophonic style) in  which a certain theme appears several times almost always in the same  form (_i.e._, not thematically varied), the repetitions of this theme  being separated by contrasting material.    The _rondo_ is the oldest of the larger monophonic forms and has been  used in many different ways, but perhaps its most characteristic  construction is as follows: (1) Principal subject; (2) second subject in  dominant key; (3) principal subject; (4) third subject; (5) first  subject again; (6) second subject, in _tonic key_; (7) coda (or ending).    The student should note particularly the problem of repetition and  contrast (mentioned in Sec. 134) as here worked out, as the rondo was  the first monophonic form in which this matter was at all satisfactorily  solved, and its construction is especially interesting because it is  readily seen to be one of the direct predecessors of the highest form of  all--the sonata. Examples of rondos may be found in any volume of  sonatas or sonatinas.    150. A _suite_ is a set of instrumental dances all in the same or in  nearly related keys. The first dance is usually preceded by an  introduction or prelude, and the various dances are so grouped as to  secure contrast of movement--a quick dance being usually followed by a  slower one.         The suite is interesting to students of the development of       music as being the first form _in several movements_ to be       generally adopted by composers. It retained its popularity       from the beginning of the seventeenth to the end of the       eighteenth centuries, being finally displaced by the sonata,       whose immediate predecessor it is thus seen to be.    The _suite_ was formerly written for solo instrument only (harpsichord,  clavichord, piano) but modern composers like Dvo[vr]ak, Lachner,  Moszkowski, and others have written suites for full orchestra also.    151. Among the dances commonly found in suites are the following:         _Allemande_--duple or quadruple measure.         _Bolero_--triple measure.         _Bouree_--duple or quadruple measure.         _Chaconne_--triple measure.         _Courante_--a very old dance in triple measure.         _Csardas_--Hungarian dance in duple or quadruple measure.         _Gavotte_--quadruple measure.         _Gigue_ (or _jig_)--duple measure.         _Habanera_--Spanish dance in triple measure.         _Minuet_--slow dance in triple measure.         _Mazurka_--Polish dance in triple measure.         _Polonaise_--Polish dance in triple measure.         _Rigaudon_--lively dance in duple or triple measure.         _Sarabande_--triple measure.         _Tarantella_--swift Italian dance in sextuple measure.    The _allemande_ is especially interesting to students of music form  because of its relation to the sonata, it being the prototype of the  sonata-allegro (_i.e._, the first movement of the sonata). The  _sarabande_ and _courante_ are likewise interesting as the prototypes of  the second movement, and the _bouree_, _minuet_, etc., for their  connection with the third movement.    152. The _scherzo_ (lit. musical joke) is a fanciful instrumental  composition. It was used by Beethoven as the third movement of the  sonata instead of the more limited minuet, but is also often found as an  independent piece.    153. A _sonata_ is an instrumental composition of three or more  movements (usually four), the first and last of which are almost always  in rapid tempo. Each of these movements is a piece of music with a unity  of its own, but they are all merged together in a larger whole with a  broad underlying unity of larger scope. The composition receives its  name from the fact that its first movement is cast in _sonata-form_.  (See Sec. 157 for description of sonata-form.)    When the _sonata_ has four movements, these are usually arranged as  follows:         1. A quick movement (_allegro_, _presto_, etc.), often       preceded by a slower introduction.         2. A slow movement (_largo_, _andante_, _adagio_, etc.).         3. A minuet or scherzo, often with a trio added, in which case       the part preceding the trio is repeated after the trio is       played.         4. A quick movement--the finale, sometimes a rondo, sometimes       another sonata-form, sometimes a theme with variations.    These movements are all in closely related keys, but in a variety of  contrasting rhythms.    154. A _trio_ is a sonata for three instruments (such as piano, violin,  and cello), while a _quartet_ is a sonata for four instruments, the most  common quartet combination being as follows: First and second violins,  viola, and violoncello.    The term _chamber music_ is often applied to instrumental music for  trio, quartet, quintet, and other similar combinations which are  suitable for a small room rather than for a large concert hall.         The words _trio_ and _quartet_ are also applied to vocal works       for three and four voices respectively, these having no       relation whatsoever to the sonata as described above. The word       _trio_ is also applied to the middle section of minuets,       scherzas, marches, etc., the term originating in the old usage       of writing this part for three instruments only.    155. A _concerto_ is a sonata for a solo instrument with orchestral  accompaniment, the form being usually somewhat modified so as to adapt  it to a composition in which there must necessarily be opportunity for  a good deal of technical display. There are usually but three movements  in the _concerto_."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1951"],[0,"The Coming Race (#14)"],[1,"by one process it destroys, by  another it heals--by one it can rend the rock, by another disperse the  vapour--by one it affects bodies, by another it can exercise a certain  influence over minds. It is usually carried in the convenient size of  a walking-staff, but it has slides by which it can be lengthened or  shortened at will. When used for special purposes, the upper part rests  in the hollow of the palm with the fore and middle fingers protruded.  I was assured, however, that its power was not equal in all, but  proportioned to the amount of certain vril properties in the wearer in  affinity, or 'rapport' with the purposes to be effected. Some were more  potent to destroy, others to heal, &c.; much also depended on the calm  and steadiness of volition in the manipulator. They assert that the  full exercise of vril power can only be acquired by the constitutional  temperament--i.e., by hereditarily transmitted organisation--and that  a female infant of four years old belonging to the Vril-ya races can  accomplish feats which a life spent in its practice would not enable  the strongest and most skilled mechanician, born out of the pale of the  Vril-ya to achieve. All these wands are not equally complicated; those  intrusted to children are much simpler than those borne by sages of  either sex, and constructed with a view to the special object on which  the children are employed; which as I have before said, is among the  youngest children the most destructive. In the wands of wives and  mothers the correlative destroying force is usually abstracted, the  healing power fully charged. I wish I could say more in detail of this  singular conductor of the vril fluid, but its machinery is as exquisite  as its effects are marvellous.    I should say, however, that this people have invented certain tubes by  which the vril fluid can be conducted towards the object it is meant  to destroy, throughout a distance almost indefinite; at least I put  it modestly when I say from 500 to 1000 miles. And their mathematical  science as applied to such purpose is so nicely accurate, that on  the report of some observer in an air-boat, any member of the vril  department can estimate unerringly the nature of intervening obstacles,  the height to which the projectile instrument should be raised, and the  extent to which it should be charged, so as to reduce to ashes within a  space of time too short for me to venture to specify it, a capital twice  as vast as London.    Certainly these Ana are wonderful mathematicians--wonderful for the  adaptation of the inventive faculty to practical uses.    I went with my host and his daughter Zee over the great public museum,  which occupies a wing in the College of Sages, and in which are hoarded,  as curious specimens of the ignorant and blundering experiments of  ancient times, many contrivances on which we pride ourselves as recent  achievements. In one department, carelessly thrown aside as obsolete  lumber, are tubes for destroying life by metallic balls and an  inflammable powder, on the principle of our cannons and catapults, and  even still more murderous than our latest improvements.    My host spoke of these with a smile of contempt, such as an artillery  officer might bestow on the bows and arrows of the Chinese. In another  department there were models of vehicles and vessels worked by steam,  and of an air-balloon which might have been constructed by Montgolfier.  \"Such,\" said Zee, with an air of meditative wisdom--\"such were the  feeble triflings with nature of our savage forefathers, ere they had  even a glimmering perception of the properties of vril!\"    This young Gy was a magnificent specimen of the muscular force to which  the females of her country attain. Her features were beautiful, like  those of all her race: never in the upper world have I seen a face so  grand and so faultless, but her devotion to the severer studies had  given to her countenance an expression of abstract thought which  rendered it somewhat stern when in repose; and such a sternness became  formidable when observed in connection with her ample shoulders and  lofty stature. She was tall even for a Gy, and I saw her lift up a  cannon as easily as I could lift a pocket-pistol. Zee inspired me with a  profound terror--a terror which increased when we came into a department  of the museum appropriated to models of contrivances worked by the  agency of vril; for here, merely by a certain play of her vril staff,  she herself standing at a distance, she put into movement large and  weighty substances. She seemed to endow them with intelligence, and to  make them comprehend and obey her command. She set complicated pieces of  machinery into movement, arrested the movement or continued it, until,  within an incredibly short time, various kinds of raw material were  reproduced as symmetrical works of art, complete and perfect. Whatever  effect mesmerism or electro-biology produces over the nerves and muscles  of animated objects, this young Gy produced by the motions of her  slender rod over the springs and wheels of lifeless mechanism.    When I mentioned to my companions my astonishment at this influence  over inanimate matter--while owning that, in our world, I had witnessed  phenomena which showed that over certain living organisations certain  other living organisations could establish an influence genuine in  itself, but often exaggerated by credulity or craft--Zee, who was more  interested in such subjects than her father, bade me stretch forth my  hand, and then, placing it beside her own, she called my attention to  certain distinctions of type and character. In the first place, the  thumb of the Gy (and, as I afterwards noticed, of all that race, male or  female) was much larger, at once longer and more massive, than is found  with our species above ground. There is almost, in this, as great a  difference as there is between the thumb of a man and that of a gorilla.  Secondly, the palm is proportionally thicker than ours--the texture of  the skin infinitely finer and softer--its average warmth is greater.  More remarkable than all this, is a visible nerve, perceptible under the  skin, which starts from the wrist skirting the ball of the thumb, and  branching, fork-like, at the roots of the fore and middle fingers. \"With  your slight formation of thumb,\" said the philosophical young Gy, \"and  with the absence of the nerve which you find more or less developed in  the hands of our race, you can never achieve other than imperfect  and feeble power over the agency of vril; but so far as the nerve is  concerned, that is not found in the hands of our earliest progenitors,  nor in those of the ruder tribes without the pale of the Vril-ya. It has  been slowly developed in the course of generations, commencing in the  early achievements, and increasing with the continuous exercise, of the  vril power; therefore, in the course of one or two thousand years, such  a nerve may possibly be engendered in those higher beings of your  race, who devote themselves to that paramount science through which  is attained command over all the subtler forces of nature permeated  by vril. But when you talk of matter as something in itself inert  and motionless, your parents or tutors surely cannot have left you so  ignorant as not to know that no form of matter is motionless and inert:  every particle is constantly in motion and constantly acted upon by  agencies, of which heat is the most apparent and rapid, but vril the  most subtle, and, when skilfully wielded, the most powerful. So that,  in fact, the current launched by my hand and guided by my will does but  render quicker and more potent the action which is eternally at work  upon every particle of matter, however inert and stubborn it may seem.  If a heap of metal be not capable of originating a thought of its own,  yet, through its internal susceptibility to movement, it obtains the  power to receive the thought of the intellectual agent at work on it; by  which, when conveyed with a sufficient force of the vril power, it is  as much compelled to obey as if it were displaced by a visible bodily  force. It is animated for the time being by the soul thus infused into  it, so that one may almost say that it lives and reasons. Without this  we could not make our automata supply the place of servants.\"    I was too much in awe of the thews and the learning of the young Gy  to hazard the risk of arguing with her. I had read somewhere in my  schoolboy days that a wise man, disputing with a Roman Emperor, suddenly  drew in his horns; and when the emperor asked him whether he had nothing  further to say on his side of the question, replied, \"Nay, Caesar, there  is no arguing against a reasoner who commands ten legions.\"    Though I had a secret persuasion that, whatever the real effects of  vril upon matter, Mr. Faraday could have proved her a very shallow  philosopher as to its extent or its causes, I had no doubt that Zee  could have brained all the Fellows of the Royal Society, one after the  other, with a blow of her fist. Every sensible man knows that it is  useless to argue with any ordinary female upon matters he comprehends;  but to argue with a Gy seven feet high upon the mysteries of vril,--as  well argue in a desert, and with a simoon!    Amid the various departments to which the vast building of the College  of Sages was appropriated, that which interested me most was devoted to  the archaeology of the Vril-ya, and comprised a very ancient collection  of portraits. In these the pigments and groundwork employed were of  so durable a nature that even pictures said to be executed at dates as  remote as those in the earliest annals of the Chinese, retained much  freshness of colour. In examining this collection, two things especially  struck me:--first, that the pictures said to be between 6000 and 7000  years old were of a much higher degree of art than any"]]]
