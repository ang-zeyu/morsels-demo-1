He came  to tell me that it might tend towards goodwill amongst the charmed  circle of G.H.Q. if even now, at the eleventh hour, I would sweeten  Woodward by bringing him along. I said, yes, if he, Braithwaite, would  stand surety that he, Woodward, had fixed up his base hospitals and  third echelon, but if not, no! Next came Woodward himself. With great  pertinacity he represented that his subordinates could do all that had  to be done at the base. He says he speaks for the Q.M.G., as well as for  the Director General of Medical Services, and that they all want to  accompany me on my reconnaissance of the coasts of the Peninsula. I was  a little sharp with him. These heads of Departments think they must be  sitting in the C.-in-C.'s pocket lest they lose caste. But I say the  Departments must be where their work lies, or else the C.-in-C. will  lose caste, and luckily he can still put his own Staff where he will.  Finally, I agreed to take with me the Assistant to the Director of  Medical Services to advise his own Chief as to the local bearings of his  scheme for clearing out the sick and wounded; the others stay here until  they get their several shows into working order, and with that my A.G.  had fain to be content.    D'Amade and two or three Frenchmen are dining with me to-night. Sir John  Maxwell has just arrived.    _6th April, 1915. Alexandria._ Started out at 9.15 with d'Amade and Sir  John to review the Mounted troops of the 29th Division. We first saw  them march down the road in column of route. What a contrast between  these solid looking men on their magnificent weight-carrying horses and  our wiry little Allies on their barbs and Arabs. The R.H.A. were superb.    After seeing the troops I motored to Mex Camp and inspected the 86th and  87th Infantry Brigades. There was a strong wind blowing which tried to  spoil the show, but could not--that Infantry was too superb! Alexander,  Hannibal, Caesar, Napoleon; not one of them had the handling of  legionaries like these. The Fusilier Brigade were the heavier. If we  don't win, I won't be able to put it on the men.    Maxwell left at 4 p.m. for Cairo. I have pressed him hard about Cox's  Indian Brigade and told him of my conversation with Cox himself and of  how keen all ranks of the Brigade are to come. No use. He expects, so he  says, a big attack on the Canal any moment; he has heard nothing from  K.; the fact that K. has ignored my direct appeal to him shows he would  not approve, etc., etc., etc. All this is just the line I myself would  probably take--I admit it--if asked by another General to part with my  troops. The arrangement whereby I have to sponge on Maxwell for men if I  want them is a detestable arrangement. At the last he consented to cable  K. direct on the point himself and then he is to let me know. Two things  are quite certain; the Brigade are not wanted in Egypt. Old campaigners  versed in Egyptian war lore tell me that the drying up of the wells must  put the lid on to any move across the desert until the winter rains,  and, apart from this, how in the name of the beard of their own false  prophet can the Turks attack Egypt whilst we are at the gates of  Constantinople?    But if the Brigade are not wanted on the Canal, we are bound to be the  better for them at the Dardanelles, whatever course matters there may  take. Concentration is the cue! The German or Japanese General Staffs  would tumble to these truths and act upon them presto. K. sees them too,  but nothing can overcome his passion for playing off one Commander  against another, whereby K. of K. keeps all reins in his hands and  remains sole arbiter between them.    Birdwood has just turned up. We're off to-morrow evening.    'Phoned Maxwell last thing telling him to be sure not to forget to jog  K.'s elbow about Cox and his Gurkhas.    _7th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\" 10 p.m._ D'Amade looked in to say  good-bye.    On my way down to the harbour I overhauled the Assyrian Jewish Refugee  Mule Corps at the Wardian Camp. Their Commander, author of that  thrilling shocker, \"The Man-killers of Tsavo,\" finds Assyrians and mules  rather a mouthful and is going to tabloid bipeds and quadrupeds into  \"The Zion Corps.\" The mules look very fit; so do the Assyrians and,  although I did not notice that their cohorts were gleaming with purple  or gold, they may help us to those habiliments: they may, in fact, serve  as ground bait to entice the big Jew journalists and bankers towards our  cause; the former will lend us the colour, the latter the coin. Anyway,  so far as I can, I mean to give the chosen people a chance.    Got aboard at 5.15, but owing to some hitch in the arrangements for  filling up our tanks with fresh water, we are held up and won't get off  until to-morrow morning.    If there drops a gnat into the ointment of the General, be sure there  are ten thousand flies stinking the ointment of the troops.    _8th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\"_ Sailing free to the Northwards. A  fine day and a smooth sea. What would not Richard Coeur de Lion or  Napoleon have given for the _Arcadian_ to take them to St. Jean d'Acre  and Jerusalem?    As we were clearing harbour a letter was brought out to us by a launch:                                                           \"UNION CLUB,                                                            \"ALEXANDRIA.    \"The following telephone received from General Maxwell, Cairo:--Your  message re Cox, I will do my best to meet your wishes. Will you in your  turn assist me in getting the seaplanes arriving here in _Ganges_? I  have wired to Admiral de Robeck, I want them badly, so please help me if  you can.                     \"_Forwarded by_ ADMIRAL ROBINSON.\"    Cutlet for cutlet! I wish it had occurred to me sooner to do a deal with  some aeroplanes. But, then I have none. No matter: I should have  promised him de Robeck's! South Africa repeats itself! Egypt and Mudros  are not one but two. Maxwell and I are co-equal allies; _not_ a combine  under a Boss!          CHAPTER IV    CLEARING FOR ACTION      _9th April, 1915. S.S. \"Arcadian.\"_ Isles of the Aegean; one more lovely  than the other; weather warm; wireless off; a great ship steaming fast  towards a great adventure--why do I walk up and down the deck feeling a  ton's weight of trouble weighing down upon my shoulders? Never till  to-day has solicitude become painful. This is the fault of Birdwood,  Hunter-Weston and Paris. I read their \"appreciations of the situation\"  some days ago, but until to-day I have not had the unbroken hour needed  to digest them. Birdwood begins by excusing himself in advance against  any charge of vacillation. At our first meeting he said he was convinced  our best plan would be to go for the South of the Gallipoli Peninsula.  Now he has, in fact, very much shifted his ground under the influence of  a new consideration, \"(which I only learned after leaving Lemnos) that  the Turks now have guns or howitzers on the Asiatic side which could  actually command our transports should they anchor off Morto Bay.\" \"As I  told you,\" he says, \"after thinking it out thoroughly, I was convinced  our best plan would be to go for the South of the Gallipoli Peninsula,\"  but now he continues, he finds his Staff \"all seem to be keen on a  landing somewhere between Saros Bay and Enos. For this I have no use, as  though I think we should doubtless be able to effect a landing there  pretty easily, yet I do not see that we shall be any 'forrarder' by  doing so. We might put ourselves in front of the Bulair Lines, but there  would be far less object in attacking them and working South-west with  the Navy only partially able to help us, than by working up from the  other end with the Navy on either flank.\"    Birdwood himself rather inclines towards a landing on the Asiatic side,  for preference somewhere South of Tenedos. The attractive part of his  idea is that if we did this the Turks must withdraw most of their mobile  artillery from the Peninsula to meet us, which would give the Navy just  the opportunity they require for mine-sweeping and so forcing the  Narrows forthwith. They know they can give the superstition of old Forts  being stronger than new ships its quietus if only they can clear a  passage through the minefield. There are forts and forts, ships and  ships, no doubt. But from what we have done already the sailors know  that our ships here can knock out those forts here. But first they must  tackle the light guns which protect the minefield from the sweepers.  Birdwood seems to think we might dominate the Peninsula from the country  round Chunuk. In his P.S. he suggests that anyway, if we are beaten off  in our attempt to land on the Peninsula we may have this Asiatic scheme  in our mind as a second string. Disembarkation plans already made would  \"probably be suitable _anywhere_ with very slight modifications. We  might perhaps even think of this--if we try the other first and can't  pull it off?\"    In my answer, I say I am still for taking the shortest, most direct  route to my objective, the Narrows.    First, because \"I have no roving commission to conquer Asia Minor.\" My  instructions deny me the whole of that country when they lay down as a  principle that \"The occupation of the Asiatic side by military forces is  to be strongly deprecated.\"    Secondly, because I agree that a landing between Saros Bay and Enos  would leave us no \"forrarder.\" There we should be attacked in front from  Rodosto; in flank from Adrianople; in rear from Bulair; whilst, as we  advanced, we would lose touch with the Fleet. But if our scheme is to be  based on severance from the Fleet we must delay another month or six  weeks to collect pack transport.    Thirdly, the Asiatic side _does not_ dominate the Peninsula whereas the  Kilid Bahr plateau _does_ dominate the Asiatic narrows.    Fourthly, the whole"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#14)"],[1,"ing, but _fulfils nothing_.--Hard upon the heels of the \"glad  tidings\" came the worst imaginable: those of Paul. In Paul is incarnated  the very opposite of the \"bearer of glad tidings\"; he represents the  genius for hatred, the vision of hatred, the relentless logic of hatred.  _What_, indeed, has not this dysangelist sacrificed to hatred! Above  all, the Saviour: he nailed him to _his own_ cross. The life, the  example, the teaching, the death of Christ, the meaning and the law of  the whole gospels--nothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter  in hatred had reduced it to his uses. Surely _not_ reality; surely _not_  historical truth!... Once more the priestly instinct of the Jew  perpetrated the same old master crime against history--he simply struck  out the yesterday and the day before yesterday of Christianity, and  _invented his own history of Christian beginnings_. Going further, he  treated the history of Israel to another falsification, so that it  became a mere prologue to _his_ achievement: all the prophets, it now  appeared, had referred to _his_ \"Saviour.\"... Later on the church even  falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to  Christianity.... The figure of the Saviour, his teaching, his way of  life, his death, the meaning of his death, even the consequences of his  death--nothing remained untouched, nothing remained in even remote  contact with reality. Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that  whole life to a place _behind_ this existence--in the _lie_ of the  \"risen\" Jesus. At bottom, he had no use for the life of the  Saviour--what he needed was the death on the cross, _and_ something  more. To see anything honest in such a man as Paul, whose home was at  the centre of the Stoical enlightenment, when he converts an  hallucination into a _proof_ of the resurrection of the Saviour, or even  to believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination  himself--this would be a genuine _niaiserie_ in a psychologist. Paul  willed the end; _therefore_ he also willed the means.... What he himself  didn't believe was swallowed readily enough by the idiots among whom he  spread _his_ teaching.--What _he_ wanted was power; in Paul the priest  once more reached out for power--he had use only for such concepts,  teachings and symbols as served the purpose of tyrannizing over the  masses and organizing mobs. _What_ was the only part of Christianity  that Mohammed borrowed later on? Paul's invention, his device for  establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob: the belief in the  immortality of the soul--_that is to say, the doctrine of  \"judgment\"_....      43.    When the centre of gravity of life is placed, _not_ in life itself, but  in \"the beyond\"--in _nothingness_--then one has taken away its centre of  gravity altogether. The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all  reason, all natural instinct--henceforth, everything in the instincts  that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is  a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning:  _this_ is now the \"meaning\" of life.... Why be public-spirited? Why take  any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour together, trust one  another, or concern one's self about the common welfare, and try to  serve it?... Merely so many \"temptations,\" so many strayings from the  \"straight path.\"--\"_One_ thing only is necessary\".... That every man,  because he has an \"immortal soul,\" is as good as every other man; that  in an infinite universe of things the \"salvation\" of _every_ individual  may lay claim to eternal importance; that insignificant bigots and the  three-fourths insane may assume that the laws of nature are constantly  _suspended_ in their behalf--it is impossible to lavish too much  contempt upon such a magnification of every sort of selfishness to  infinity, to _insolence_. And yet Christianity has to thank precisely  _this_ miserable flattery of personal vanity for its _triumph_--it was  thus that it lured all the botched, the dissatisfied, the fallen upon  evil days, the whole refuse and off-scouring of humanity to its side.  The \"salvation of the soul\"--in plain English: \"the world revolves  around _me_.\"... The poisonous doctrine, \"_equal_ rights for all,\" has  been propagated as a Christian principle: out of the secret nooks and  crannies of bad instinct Christianity has waged a deadly war upon all  feelings of reverence and distance between man and man, which is to  say, upon the first _prerequisite_ to every step upward, to every  development of civilization--out of the _ressentiment_ of the masses it  has forged its chief weapons against _us_, against everything noble,  joyous and high-spirited on earth, against our happiness on earth.... To  allow \"immortality\" to every Peter and Paul was the greatest, the most  vicious outrage upon _noble_ humanity ever perpetrated.--_And_ let us  not underestimate the fatal influence that Christianity has had, even  upon politics! Nowadays no one has courage any more for special rights,  for the right of dominion, for feelings of honourable pride in himself  and his equals--for the _pathos of distance_.... Our politics is sick  with this lack of courage!--The aristocratic attitude of mind has been  undermined by the lie of the equality of souls; and if belief in the  \"privileges of the majority\" makes and _will continue to make_  revolutions--it is Christianity, let us not doubt, and _Christian_  valuations, which convert every revolution into a carnival of blood and  crime! Christianity is a revolt of all creatures that creep on the  ground against everything that is _lofty_: the gospel of the \"lowly\"  _lowers_....      44.    --The gospels are invaluable as evidence of the corruption that was  already persistent _within_ the primitive community. That which Paul,  with the cynical logic of a rabbi, later developed to a conclusion was  at bottom merely a process of decay that had begun with the death of the  Saviour.--These gospels cannot be read too carefully; difficulties lurk  behind every word. I confess--I hope it will not be held against  me--that it is precisely for this reason that they offer first-rate joy  to a psychologist--as the _opposite_ of all merely naive corruption, as  refinement _par excellence_, as an artistic triumph in psychological  corruption. The gospels, in fact, stand alone. The Bible as a whole is  not to be compared to them. Here we are among Jews: this is the _first_  thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the  matter. This positive genius for conjuring up a delusion of personal  \"holiness\" unmatched anywhere else, either in books or by men; this  elevation of fraud in word and attitude to the level of an _art_--all  this is not an accident due to the chance talents of an individual, or  to any violation of nature. The thing responsible is _race_. The whole  of Judaism appears in Christianity as the art of concocting holy lies,  and there, after many centuries of earnest Jewish training and hard  practice of Jewish technic, the business comes to the stage of mastery.  The Christian, that _ultima ratio_ of lying, is the Jew all over  again--he is _threefold_ the Jew.... The underlying will to make use  only of such concepts, symbols and attitudes as fit into priestly  practice, the instinctive repudiation of every _other_ mode of thought,  and every other method of estimating values and utilities--this is not  only tradition, it is _inheritance_: only as an inheritance is it able  to operate with the force of nature. The whole of mankind, even the best  minds of the best ages (with one exception, perhaps hardly human--),  have permitted themselves to be deceived. The gospels have been read as  a _book of innocence_ ... surely no small indication of the high skill  with which the trick has been done.--Of course, if we could actually  _see_ these astounding bigots and bogus saints, even if only for an  instant, the farce would come to an end,--and it is precisely because  _I_ cannot read a word of theirs without seeing their attitudinizing  that _I have made an end of them_.... I simply cannot endure the way  they have of rolling up their eyes.--For the majority, happily enough,  books are mere _literature_.--Let us not be led astray: they say \"judge  not,\" and yet they condemn to hell whoever stands in their way. In  letting God sit in judgment they judge themselves; in glorifying God  they glorify themselves; in _demanding_ that every one show the virtues  which they themselves happen to be capable of--still more, which they  _must_ have in order to remain on top--they assume the grand air of men  struggling for virtue, of men engaging in a war that virtue may prevail.  \"We live, we die, we sacrifice ourselves _for the good_\" (--\"the truth,\"  \"the light,\" \"the kingdom of God\"): in point of fact, they simply do  what they cannot help doing. Forced, like hypocrites, to be sneaky, to  hide in corners, to slink along in the shadows, they convert their  necessity into a _duty_: it is on grounds of duty that they account for  their lives of humility, and that humility becomes merely one more proof  of their piety.... Ah, that humble, chaste, charitable brand of fraud!  \"Virtue itself shall bear witness for us.\"... One may read the gospels  as books of _moral_ seduction: these petty folks fasten themselves to  morality--they know the uses of morality! Morality is the best of all  devices for leading mankind _by the nose_!--The fact is that the  conscious conceit of the chosen here disguises itself as modesty: it is  in this way that _they_, the \"community,\" the \"good and just,\" range  themselves, once and for always, on one side, the side of \"the  truth\"--and the rest of mankind, \"the world,\" on the other.... In _that_  we observe the most fatal sort of megalomania that the earth has ever  seen: little abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive"]]]
