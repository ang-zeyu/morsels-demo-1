The way Mrs. Semple  pampers that man is scandalous.  If she indulged him as much when he  was a baby, I don't know how he ever turned out so well.    He and I eat at a little table set on the side porch, or sometimes  under the trees, or--when it rains or is cold--in the best parlour.  He  just picks out the spot he wants to eat in and Carrie trots after him  with the table.  Then if it has been an awful nuisance, and she has had  to carry the dishes very far, she finds a dollar under the sugar bowl.    He is an awfully companionable sort of man, though you would never  believe it to see him casually; he looks at first glance like a true  Pendleton, but he isn't in the least.  He is just as simple and  unaffected and sweet as he can be--that seems a funny way to describe a  man, but it's true.  He's extremely nice with the farmers around here;  he meets them in a sort of man-to-man fashion that disarms them  immediately.  They were very suspicious at first.  They didn't care for  his clothes!  And I will say that his clothes are rather amazing.  He  wears knickerbockers and pleated jackets and white flannels and riding  clothes with puffed trousers.  Whenever he comes down in anything new,  Mrs. Semple, beaming with pride, walks around and views him from every  angle, and urges him to be careful where he sits down; she is so afraid  he will pick up some dust.  It bores him dreadfully.  He's always  saying to her:    'Run along, Lizzie, and tend to your work.  You can't boss me any  longer.  I've grown up.'    It's awfully funny to think of that great big, long-legged man (he's  nearly as long-legged as you, Daddy) ever sitting in Mrs. Semple's lap  and having his face washed.  Particularly funny when you see her lap!  She has two laps now, and three chins.  But he says that once she was  thin and wiry and spry and could run faster than he.    Such a lot of adventures we're having!  We've explored the country for  miles, and I've learned to fish with funny little flies made of  feathers.  Also to shoot with a rifle and a revolver.  Also to ride  horseback--there's an astonishing amount of life in old Grove.  We fed  him on oats for three days, and he shied at a calf and almost ran away  with me.                                                       Wednesday    We climbed Sky Hill Monday afternoon.  That's a mountain near here; not  an awfully high mountain, perhaps--no snow on the summit--but at least  you are pretty breathless when you reach the top.  The lower slopes are  covered with woods, but the top is just piled rocks and open moor.  We  stayed up for the sunset and built a fire and cooked our supper.  Master Jervie did the cooking; he said he knew how better than me and  he did, too, because he's used to camping.  Then we came down by  moonlight, and, when we reached the wood trail where it was dark, by  the light of an electric bulb that he had in his pocket.  It was such  fun!  He laughed and joked all the way and talked about interesting  things.  He's read all the books I've ever read, and a lot of others  besides.  It's astonishing how many different things he knows.    We went for a long tramp this morning and got caught in a storm.  Our  clothes were drenched before we reached home but our spirits not even  damp.  You should have seen Mrs. Semple's face when we dripped into her  kitchen.    'Oh, Master Jervie--Miss Judy!  You are soaked through.  Dear!  Dear!  What shall I do?  That nice new coat is perfectly ruined.'    She was awfully funny; you would have thought that we were ten years  old, and she a distracted mother.  I was afraid for a while that we  weren't going to get any jam for tea.                                                           Saturday    I started this letter ages ago, but I haven't had a second to finish it.    Isn't this a nice thought from Stevenson?                 The world is so full of a number of things,             I am sure we should all be as happy as kings.      It's true, you know.  The world is full of happiness, and plenty to go  round, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way.  The whole secret is in being PLIABLE.  In the country, especially,  there are such a lot of entertaining things.  I can walk over  everybody's land, and look at everybody's view, and dabble in  everybody's brook; and enjoy it just as much as though I owned the  land--and with no taxes to pay!    It's Sunday night now, about eleven o'clock, and I am supposed to be  getting some beauty sleep, but I had black coffee for dinner, so--no  beauty sleep for me!    This morning, said Mrs. Semple to Mr. Pendleton, with a very determined  accent:    'We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get to church  by eleven.'    'Very well, Lizzie,' said Master Jervie, 'you have the buggy ready, and  if I'm not dressed, just go on without waiting.'  'We'll wait,' said  she.    'As you please,' said he, 'only don't keep the horses standing too  long.'    Then while she was dressing, he told Carrie to pack up a lunch, and he  told me to scramble into my walking clothes; and we slipped out the  back way and went fishing.    It discommoded the household dreadfully, because Lock Willow of a  Sunday dines at two.  But he ordered dinner at seven--he orders meals  whenever he chooses; you would think the place were a restaurant--and  that kept Carrie and Amasai from going driving.  But he said it was all  the better because it wasn't proper for them to go driving without a  chaperon; and anyway, he wanted the horses himself to take me driving.  Did you ever hear anything so funny?    And poor Mrs. Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go  afterwards to a sizzling hot hell!  She is awfully troubled to think  that she didn't train him better when he was small and helpless and she  had the chance.  Besides--she wished to show him off in church.    Anyway, we had our fishing (he caught four little ones) and we cooked  them on a camp-fire for lunch.  They kept falling off our spiked sticks  into the fire, so they tasted a little ashy, but we ate them.  We got  home at four and went driving at five and had dinner at seven, and at  ten I was sent to bed and here I am, writing to you.    I am getting a little sleepy, though.                                           Good night.      Here is a picture of the one fish I caught.          Ship Ahoy, Cap'n Long-Legs!    Avast!  Belay!  Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.  Guess what I'm  reading?  Our conversation these past two days has been nautical and  piratical.  Isn't Treasure Island fun?  Did you ever read it, or wasn't  it written when you were a boy?  Stevenson only got thirty pounds for  the serial rights--I don't believe it pays to be a great author.  Maybe  I'll be a school-teacher.    Excuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson; my mind is very  much engaged with him at present.  He comprises Lock Willow's library.    I've been writing this letter for two weeks, and I think it's about  long enough.  Never say, Daddy, that I don't give details.  I wish you  were here, too; we'd all have such a jolly time together.  I like my  different friends to know each other.  I wanted to ask Mr. Pendleton if  he knew you in New York--I should think he might; you must move in  about the same exalted social circles, and you are both interested in  reforms and things--but I couldn't, for I don't know your real name.    It's the silliest thing I ever heard of, not to know your name.  Mrs.  Lippett warned me that you were eccentric.  I should think so!                               Affectionately,                                                 Judy      PS.  On reading this over, I find that it isn't all Stevenson.  There  are one or two glancing references to Master Jervie.                                                         10th September    Dear Daddy,    He has gone, and we are missing him!  When you get accustomed to people  or places or ways of living, and then have them snatched away, it does  leave an awfully empty, gnawing sort of sensation.  I'm finding Mrs.  Semple's conversation pretty unseasoned food.    College opens in two weeks and I shall be glad to begin work again.  I  have worked quite a lot this summer though--six short stories and seven  poems.  Those I sent to the magazines all came back with the most  courteous promptitude.  But I don't mind.  It's good practice.  Master  Jervie read them--he brought in the post, so I couldn't help his  knowing--and he said they were DREADFUL.  They showed that I didn't  have the slightest idea of what I was talking about.  (Master Jervie  doesn't let politeness interfere with truth.) But the last one I  did--just a little sketch laid in college--he said wasn't bad; and he  had it typewritten, and I sent it to a magazine.  They've had it two  weeks; maybe they're thinking it over.    You should see the sky!  There's the queerest orange-coloured light  over everything.  We're going to have a storm.      It commenced just that moment with tremendously big drops and all the  shutters banging.  I had to run to close the windows, while Carrie flew  to the attic with an armful of milk pans to put under the places where  the roof leaks and then, just as I was resuming my pen, I remembered  that I'd left a cushion and rug and hat and Matthew Arnold's poems  under a tree in the orchard, so I dashed out to get them, all quite  soaked.  The red cover of the poems had run into the inside; Dover  Beach in the future will be washed by pink waves.    A storm is awfully disturbing in the country.  You are always having to  think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled.                                                       Thursday    Daddy!  Daddy!  What do you think?  The postman has just come with two  letters.    1st.  My story is accepted.  $50.    ALORS!

Thus if any one looks at the setting sun for a short time, and then covers  his closed eyes with his hand, he will for many seconds of time perceive  the image of the sun on his retina. A similar image of all other bodies  would remain some time in the eye, but is effaced by the eternal change of  the motions of the extremity of this nerve in our attention to other  objects. See Sect. XVIII. 5. on Sleep. Hence the dark spots, and other  ocular spectra, are more frequently attended to, and remain longer in the  eyes of weak people, as after violent exercise, intoxication, or want of  sleep.    6. A contraction of the fibres somewhat greater than usual introduces  pleasurable sensation into the system, according to the fourth law of  animal causation. Hence the pleasure in the beginning of drunkenness is  owing to the increased action of the system from the stimulus of vinous  spirit or of opium. If the contractions be still greater in energy or  duration, painful sensations are introduced, as in consequence of great  heat, or caustic applications, or fatigue.    If any part of the system, which is used to perpetual activity, as the  stomach, or heart, or the fine vessels of the skin, acts for a time with  less energy, another kind of painful sensation ensues, which is called  hunger, or faintness, or cold. This occurs in a less degree in the  locomotive muscles, and is called wearysomeness. In the two former kinds of  sensation there is an expenditure of sensorial power, in these latter there  is an accumulation of it.    7. We have used the words exertion of sensorial power as a general term to  express either irritation, sensation, volition, or association; that is, to  express the activity or motion of the spirit of animation, at the time it  produces the contractions of the fibrous parts of the system. It may be  supposed that there may exist a greater or less mobility of the fibrous  parts of our system, or a propensity to be stimulated into contraction by  the greater or less quantity or energy of the spirit of animation; and that  hence if the exertion of the sensorial power be in its natural state, and  the mobility of the fibres be increased, the same quantity of fibrous  contraction will be caused, as if the mobility of the fibres continues in  its natural state, and the sensorial exertion be increased.    Thus it may be conceived, that in diseases accompanied with strength, as in  inflammatory fevers with arterial strength, that the cause of greater  fibrous contraction, may exist in the increased mobility of the fibres,  whose contractions are thence both more forceable and more frequent. And  that in diseases attended with debility, as in nervous fevers, where the  fibrous contractions are weaker, and more frequent, it may be conceived  that the cause consists in a decrease of mobility of the fibres; and that  those weak constitutions, which are attended with cold extremities and  large pupils of the eyes, may possess less mobility of the contractile  fibres, as well as less quantity of exertion of the spirit of animation.    In answer to this mode of reasoning it may be sufficient to observe, that  the contractile fibres consist of inert matter, and when the sensorial  power is withdrawn, as in death, they possess no power of motion at all,  but remain in their last state, whether of contraction or relaxation, and  must thence derive the whole of this property from the spirit of animation.  At the same time it is not improbable, that the moving fibres of strong  people may possess a capability of receiving or containing a greater  quantity of the spirit of animation than those of weak people.    In every contraction of a fibre there is an expenditure of the sensorial  power, or spirit of animation; and where the exertion of this sensorial  power has been for some time increased, and the muscles or organs of sense  have in consequence acted with greater energy, its propensity to activity  is proportionally lessened; which is to be ascribed to the exhaustion or  diminution of its quantity. On the contrary, where there has been less  fibrous contraction than usual for a certain time, the sensorial power or  spirit of animation becomes accumulated in the inactive part of the system.  Hence vigour succeeds rest, and hence the propensity to action of all our  organs of sense and muscles is in a state of perpetual fluctuation. The  irritability for instance of the retina, that is, its quantity of sensorial  power, varies every moment according to the brightness or obscurity of the  object last beheld compared with the present one. The same occurs to our  sense of heat, and to every part of our system, which is capable of being  excited into action.    When this variation of the exertion of the sensorial power becomes much and  permanently above or beneath the natural quantity, it becomes a disease. If  the irritative motions be too great or too little, it shews that the  stimulus of external things affect this sensorial power too violently or  too inertly. If the sensitive motions be too great or too little, the cause  arises from the deficient or exuberant quantity of sensation produced in  consequence of the motions of the muscular fibres or organs of sense; if  the voluntary actions are diseased the cause is to be looked for in the  quantity of volition produced in consequence of the desire or aversion  occasioned by the painful or pleasurable sensations above mentioned. And  the diseases of associations probably depend on the greater or less  quantity of the other three sensorial powers by which they were formed.    From whence it appears that the propensity to action, whether it be called  irritability, sensibility, voluntarity, or associability, is only another  mode of expression for the quantity of sensorial power residing in the  organ to be excited. And that on the contrary the words inirritability and  insensibility, together with inaptitude to voluntary and associate motions,  are synonymous with deficiency of the quantity of sensorial power, or of  the spirit of animation, residing in the organs to be excited.    II. _Of sensorial Exertion._    1. There are three circumstances to be attended to in the production of  animal motions, 1st. The stimulus. 2d. The sensorial power. 3d. The  contractile fibre. 1st. A stimulus, external to the organ, originally  induces into action the sensorial faculty termed irritation; this produces  the contraction of the fibres, which, if it be perceived at all, introduces  pleasure or pain; which in their active state are termed sensation; which  is another sensorial faculty, and occasionally produces contraction of the  fibres; this pleasure or pain is therefore to be considered as another  stimulus, which may either act alone or in conjunction with the former  faculty of the sensorium termed irritation.    This new stimulus of pleasure or pain either induces into action the  sensorial faculty termed sensation, which then produces the contraction of  the fibres; or it introduces desire or aversion, which excite into action  another sensorial faculty, termed volition, and may therefore be considered  as another stimulus, which either alone or in conjunction with one or both  of the two former faculties of the sensorium produces the contraction of  animal fibres. There is another sensorial power, that of association, which  perpetually, in conjunction with one or more of the above, and frequently  singly, produces the contraction of animal fibres, and which is itself  excited into action by the previous motions of contracting fibres.    Now as the sensorial power, termed irritation, residing in any particular  fibres, is excited into exertion by the stimulus of external bodies acting  on those fibres; the sensorial power, termed sensation, residing in any  particular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of pleasure or  pain acting on those fibres; the sensorial power, termed volition, residing  in any particular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of desire  or aversion; and the sensorial power, termed association, residing in any  particular fibres, is excited into action by the stimulus of other fibrous  motions, which had frequently preceded them. The word stimulus may  therefore be used without impropriety of language, for any of these four  causes, which excite the four sensorial powers into exertion. For though  the immediate cause of volition has generally been termed _a motive_; and  that of irritation only has generally obtained the name of _stimulus_; yet  as the immediate cause, which excites the sensorial powers of sensation, or  of association into exertion, have obtained no general name, we shall use  the word stimulus for them all.    Hence the quantity of motion produced in any particular part of the animal  system will be as the quantity of stimulus and the quantity of sensorial  power, or spirit of animation, residing in the contracting fibres. Where  both these quantities are great, _strength_ is produced, when that word is  applied to the motions of animal bodies. Where either of them is deficient,  _weakness_ is produced, as applied to the motions of animal bodies.    Now as the sensorial power, or spirit of animation, is perpetually  exhausted by the expenditure of it in fibrous contractions, and is  perpetually renewed by the secretion or production of it in the brain and  spinal marrow, the quantity of animal strength must be in a perpetual state  of fluctuation on this account; and if to this be added the unceasing  variation of all the four kinds of stimulus above described, which produce  the exertions of the sensorial powers, the ceaseless vicissitude of animal  strength becomes easily comprehended.
