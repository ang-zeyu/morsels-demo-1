Egad--I'm serious--Don't you remember--one Day, when I called  here----    SURFACE. Nay--prithee--Charles    CHARLES. And found you together----    SURFACE. Zounds, Sir--I insist----    CHARLES. And another time when your Servant----    SURFACE. Brother--brother a word with you--Gad I must stop him--[Aside.]    CHARLES. Informed--me that----    SURFACE. Hush!--I beg your Pardon but Sir Peter has overheard all we  have been saying--I knew you would clear yourself, or I shouldn't have  consented--    CHARLES. How Sir Peter--Where is He--    SURFACE. Softly, there! [Points to the closet.]    CHARLES. [In the Closet!] O 'fore Heaven I'll have him out--Sir Peter  come forth!    SURFACE. No--no----    CHARLES.

But I acquit you--I promise you I don't think near so ill of  you as I did--what I have heard has given me great satisfaction.    CHARLES. Egad then 'twas lucky you didn't hear any more. Wasn't it  Joseph?    SIR PETER. Ah! you would have retorted on him.    CHARLES. Aye--aye--that was a Joke.    SIR PETER. Yes, yes, I know his honor too well.    CHARLES. Yet you might as well have suspected him as me in this matter,  for all that--mightn't He, Joseph?    SIR PETER. Well well I believe you--    SURFACE. Would they were both out of the Room!

They must not be left together.--I'll send this man away and  return directly--         [SURFACE goes out.]    SIR PETER. Ah--Charles if you associated more with your Brother, one  might indeed hope for your reformation--He is a man of Sentiment--Well!  there is nothing in the world so noble as a man of Sentiment!    CHARLES. Pshaw! He is too moral by half--and so apprehensive of his good  Name, as he calls it, that I suppose He would as soon let a Priest in  his House as a Girl--    SIR PETER. No--no--come come,--you wrong him. No, no, Joseph is no Rake  but he is no such Saint in that respect either. I have a great mind to  tell him--we should have such a Laugh!    CHARLES. Oh, hang him? He's a very Anchorite--a young Hermit!    SIR PETER. Harkee--you must not abuse him, he may chance to hear of it  again I promise you.    CHARLES. Why you won't tell him?    SIR PETER. No--but--this way. Egad, I'll tell him--Harkee, have you a  mind to have a good laugh against Joseph?    CHARLES. I should like it of all things--    SIR PETER.

Hush!--a little French Milliner--and the best of the jest  is--she's in the room now.    CHARLES. The devil she is--    SIR PETER. Hush! I tell you. [Points.]    CHARLES. Behind the screen! Odds Life, let's unveil her!    SIR PETER. No--no! He's coming--you shan't indeed!    CHARLES. Oh, egad, we'll have a peep at the little milliner!    SIR PETER. Not for the world--Joseph will never forgive me.    CHARLES. I'll stand by you----    SIR PETER. Odds Life!

What! is Honesty Dumb too?--Sir Peter, though I  found you in the Dark--perhaps you are not so now--all mute! Well tho'  I can make nothing of the Affair, I make no doubt but you perfectly  understand one another--so I'll leave you to yourselves.--[Going.]  Brother I'm sorry to find you have given that worthy man grounds for so  much uneasiness!--Sir Peter--there's nothing in the world so noble as a  man of Sentiment!--         [Stand for some time looking at one another.

S  he Sir--I say call'd here--in order that I might explain those  Pretensions--but on your coming being apprehensive--as I said of your  Jealousy--she withdrew--and this, you may depend on't is the whole truth  of the Matter.    SIR PETER. A very clear account upon the [my] word and I dare swear the  Lady will vouch for every article of it.    LADY TEAZLE. For not one word of it Sir Peter--    SIR PETER. How[!] don't you think it worthwhile to agree in the lie.    LADY TEAZLE. There is not one Syllable of Truth in what that Gentleman  has told you.    SIR PETER.

Aye let her alone Sir--you'll find she'll make out a better  story than you without Prompting.    LADY TEAZLE. Hear me Sir Peter--I came hither on no matter relating to  your ward and even ignorant of this Gentleman's pretensions to her--but  I came--seduced by his insidious arguments--and pretended Passion[--]at  least to listen to his dishonourable Love if not to sacrifice your  Honour to his Baseness.    SIR PETER. Now, I believe, the Truth is coming indeed[.]    SURFACE. The Woman's mad--    LADY TEAZLE. No Sir--she has recovered her Senses. Your own Arts have  furnished her with the means. Sir Peter--I do not expect you to credit  me--but the Tenderness you express'd for me, when I am sure you could  not think I was a witness to it, has penetrated so to my Heart that had  I left the Place without the Shame of this discovery--my future  life should have spoken the sincerity of my Gratitude--as for that  smooth-tongued Hypocrite--who would have seduced the wife of his too  credulous Friend while he pretended honourable addresses to his ward--I  behold him now in a light so truly despicable that I shall never again  Respect myself for having Listened to him.

Go, fool!--        [Exit SERVANT.]    Sure Fortune never play'd a man of my policy such a Trick before--my  character with Sir Peter!--my Hopes with Maria!--destroy'd in a  moment!--I'm in a rare Humour to listen to other People's Distresses!--I  shan't be able to bestow even a benevolent sentiment on Stanley--So!  here--He comes and Rowley with him--I MUST try to recover myself, and  put a little Charity into my Face however.----         [Exit.]         Enter SIR OLIVER and ROWLEY    SIR OLIVER.

It was Sir--but I doubt you are come a little too abruptly--his  Nerves are so weak that the sight of a poor Relation may be too much for  him--I should have gone first to break you to him.    SIR OLIVER. A Plague of his Nerves--yet this is He whom Sir Peter  extolls as a Man of the most Benevolent way of thinking!--    ROWLEY. As to his way of thinking--I can't pretend to decide[,] for, to  do him justice He appears to have as much speculative Benevolence as any  private Gentleman in the Kingdom--though he is seldom so sensual as to  indulge himself in the exercise of it----    SIR OLIVER. Yet [he] has a string of charitable Sentiments I suppose at  his Fingers' ends!--    ROWLEY. Or, rather at his Tongue's end Sir Oliver; for I believe there  is no sentiment he has more faith in than that 'Charity begins at Home.'    SIR OLIVER. And his I presume is of that domestic sort which never stirs  abroad at all.    ROWLEY. I doubt you'll find it so--but He's coming--I mustn't seem to  interrupt you--and you know immediately--as you leave him--I come in to  announce--your arrival in your real Character.    SIR OLIVER. True--and afterwards you'll meet me at Sir Peter's----    ROWLEY. Without losing a moment.

How tremendous our  responsibility; how delicate and laborious our task!    Dear friends: Clear and emphatic as are the instructions which our  departed Master has reiterated in countless Tablets bequeathed by Him to  His followers throughout the world, a few, owing to the restricted  influence of the Cause in the West, have been purposely withheld from the  body of His occidental disciples, who, despite their numerical  inferiority, are now exercising such a preponderating influence in the  direction and administration of its affairs. I feel it, therefore,  incumbent upon me to stress, now that the time is ripe, the importance of  an instruction which, at the present stage of the evolution of our Faith,  should be increasingly emphasized, irrespective of its application to the  East or to the West. And this principle is no other than that which  involves the non-participation by the adherents of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah, whether in their individual capacities or collectively as  local or national Assemblies, in any form of activity that might be  interpreted, either directly or indirectly, as an interference in the  political affairs of any particular government. Whether it be in the  publications which they initiate and supervise; or in their official and  public deliberations; or in the posts they occupy and the services they  render; or in the communications they address to their fellow-disciples;  or in their dealings with men of eminence and authority; or in their  affiliations with kindred societies and organizations, it is, I am firmly  convinced, their first and sacred obligation to abstain from any word or  deed that might be construed as a violation of this vital principle.  Theirs is the duty to demonstrate, on one hand, the nonpolitical character  of their Faith, and to assert, on the other, their unqualified loyalty and  obedience to whatever is the considered judgment of their respective  governments.          The Divine Polity      Let them refrain from associating themselves, whether by word or by deed,  with the political pursuits of their respective nations, with the policies  of their governments and the schemes and programs of parties and factions.  In such controversies they should assign no blame, take no side, further  no design, and identify themselves with no system prejudicial to the best  interests of that world-wide Fellowship which it is their aim to guard and  foster. Let them beware lest they allow themselves to become the tools of  unscrupulous politicians, or to be entrapped by the treacherous devices of  the plotters and the perfidious among their countrymen. Let them so shape  their lives and regulate their conduct that no charge of secrecy, of  fraud, of bribery or of intimidation may, however ill-founded, be brought  against them. Let them rise above all particularism and partisanship,  above the vain disputes, the petty calculations, the transient passions  that agitate the face, and engage the attention, of a changing world. It  is their duty to strive to distinguish, as clearly as they possibly can,  and if needed with the aid of their elected representatives, such posts  and functions as are either diplomatic or political from those that are  purely administrative in character, and which under no circumstances are  affected by the changes and chances that political activities and party  government, in every land, must necessarily involve. Let them affirm their  unyielding determination to stand, firmly and unreservedly, for the way of  Baha'u'llah, to avoid the entanglements and bickerings inseparable from  the pursuits of the politician, and to become worthy agencies of that  Divine Polity which incarnates God's immutable Purpose for all men.    It should be made unmistakably clear that such an attitude implies neither  the slightest indifference to the cause and interests of their own  country, nor involves any insubordination on their part to the authority  of recognized and established governments. Nor does it constitute a  repudiation of their sacred obligation to promote, in the most effective  manner, the best interests of their government and people. It indicates  the desire cherished by every true and loyal follower of Baha'u'llah to  serve, in an unselfish, unostentatious and patriotic fashion, the highest  interests of the country to which he belongs, and in a way that would  entail no departure from the high standards of integrity and truthfulness  associated with the teachings of his Faith.    As the number of the Baha'i communities in various parts of the world  multiplies and their power, as a social force, becomes increasingly  apparent, they will no doubt find themselves increasingly subjected to the  pressure which men of authority and influence, in the political domain,  will exercise in the hope of obtaining the support they require for the  advancement of their aims. These communities will, moreover, feel a  growing need of the good-will and the assistance of their respective  governments in their efforts to widen the scope, and to consolidate the  foundations, of the institutions committed to their charge. Let them  beware lest, in their eagerness to further the aims of their beloved  Cause, they should be led unwittingly to bargain with their Faith, to  compromise with their essential principles, or to sacrifice, in return for  any material advantage which their institutions may derive, the integrity  of their spiritual ideals. Let them proclaim that in whatever country they  reside, and however advanced their institutions, or profound their desire  to enforce the laws, and apply the principles, enunciated by Baha'u'llah,  they will, unhesitatingly, subordinate the operation of such laws and the  application of such principles to the requirements and legal enactments of  their respective governments. Theirs is not the purpose, while endeavoring  to conduct and perfect the administrative affairs of their Faith, to  violate, under any circumstances, the provisions of their country's  constitution, much less to allow the machinery of their administration to  supersede the government of their respective countries.    It should also be borne in mind that the very extension of the activities  in which we are engaged, and the variety of the communities which labor  under divers forms of government, so essentially different in their  standards, policies, and methods, make it absolutely essential for all  those who are the declared members of any one of these communities to  avoid any action that might, by arousing the suspicion or exciting the  antagonism of any one government, involve their brethren in fresh  persecutions or complicate the nature of their task. How else, might I  ask, could such a far-flung Faith, which transcends political and social  boundaries, which includes within its pale so great a variety of races and  nations, which will have to rely increasingly, as it forges ahead, on the  good-will and support of the diversified and contending governments of the  earth--how else could such a Faith succeed in preserving its unity, in  safeguarding its interests, and in ensuring the steady and peaceful  development of its institutions?    Such an attitude, however, is not dictated by considerations of selfish  expediency, but is actuated, first and foremost, by the broad principle  that the followers of Baha'u'llah will, under no circumstances, suffer  themselves to be involved, whether as individuals or in their collective  capacities, in matters that would entail the slightest departure from the  fundamental verities and ideals of their Faith. Neither the charges which  the uninformed and the malicious may be led to bring against them, nor the  allurements of honors and rewards, will ever induce them to surrender  their trust or to deviate from their path. Let their words proclaim, and  their conduct testify, that they who follow Baha'u'llah, in whatever land  they reside, are actuated by no selfish ambition, that they neither thirst  for power, nor mind any wave of unpopularity, of distrust or criticism,  which a strict adherence to their standards might provoke.    Difficult and delicate though be our task, the sustaining power of  Baha'u'llah and of His Divine guidance will assuredly assist us if we  follow steadfastly in His way, and strive to uphold the integrity of His  laws. The light of His redeeming grace, which no earthly power can  obscure, will if we persevere, illuminate our path, as we steer our course  amid the snares and pitfalls of a troubled age, and will enable us to  discharge our duties in a manner that would redound to the glory and the  honor of His blessed Name.          Our Beloved Temple      And finally, dearly-beloved brethren, let me once more direct your  attention to the pressing claims of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar, our beloved  Temple. Need I remind you of the imperative necessity of carrying out to a  successful conclusion, while there is yet time, the great enterprise to  which, before the eyes of a watching world, we stand committed? Need I  stress the great damage which further delay in the prosecution of this  divinely-appointed task must, even in these critical and unforeseen  circumstances, inflict upon the prestige of our beloved Cause? I am, I can  assure you, acutely conscious of the stringency of the circumstances with  which you are faced, the embarrassments under which you labor, the cares  with which you are burdened, the pressing urgency of the demands that are  being incessantly made upon your depleted resources. I am, however, still  more profoundly aware of the unprecedented character of the opportunity  which it"]]]
