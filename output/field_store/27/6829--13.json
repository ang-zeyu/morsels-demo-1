Charcoal, in  fact, is the coaly residuum of any vegetables burnt in close vessels;  but the common charcoal is that prepared from wood, and is generally  black, very brittle, light, and destitute of taste or smell. It is a  powerful antiseptic, unalterable and indestructible.    [Footnote 7: See Chapter XII.]         _Residuum_, the remaining part, that which is left.         _Antiseptic_, that which prevents putrefaction.      What is Iron?    One of the most useful and abundant metals; being found in all mineral  earths, and stones; in plants, and animal fluids; and is the chief  cause of the varieties of color in all. Iron is found in great masses,  in various states, in the bowels of the earth; it is usually, however,  compounded with stone, from which it is separated by the action of  fire. In some parts of the world, whole mountains are formed of iron;  among these may be mentioned the Pilot Knob and the Iron Mountain, in  Missouri, being unsurpassed by anything of the kind found elsewhere.      What are its characteristics?    It is hard, fusible, not very malleable, but extremely ductile, and  very tenacious; it is of a greyish color, and nearly eight times  heavier than water. Without iron, society could make no progress in  the cultivation of the ground, in mechanical arts or trades, in  architecture or navigation; it is therefore of the greatest use to  man. Iron tools have been used in all European countries as long as  their histories have existed; this metal appears likewise to have been  known and used by the inhabitants of the world in the earliest ages,  being frequently mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. In the fourth  chapter of Genesis, Tubalcain is spoken of as \"a hammerer and  artificer in every work of brass and iron,\" and thus their existence  was evidently known at that early period of the world.         _Artificer_, one who works or makes.         _Fusible_, capable of being melted by fire.    [Illustration: THE SALT MINES OF WIELICZCA.]      What do you mean by Metals?    Useful substances dug from the bowels of the earth, being sometimes  found pure, but mostly combined with other matter. They are  distinguished by their weight, tenacity, hardness, opacity, color, and  peculiar lustre, known as the metallic lustre; they are fusible by  heat, and good conductors of heat and electricity; many of them are  malleable, and some extremely ductile. Those which were first known  are gold, silver, iron, copper, mercury, lead, and tin.         _Tenacity_, the firmness with which one part adheres to       another.         _Opacity_, want of transparency or clearness.      What are Metals called in their natural state?    Ores; so named because the metal contained in them is either mixed  with other metals, or with mineral earths, from which they are  separated and purified by various means: such as washing, roasting,  &c., but the method is always regulated by the nature of the ore.      What is Copper?    A hard, heavy, ductile metal, found native, and in many ores; of these  the most important is _copper pyrites_, which is a sulphuret of  copper. Next to gold, silver, and platinum, copper is the most  malleable and ductile of metals; it may be drawn into wires as fine as  hair, or beaten into leaves as thin as those of silver. The rust of  copper is very poisonous. Copper, mixed with a certain quantity of  tin, forms bell-metal. With a smaller proportion, it forms bronze, a  substance used in sculpture for casting figures and statues. It is an  abundant metal, and is found in various parts of the world. Native  oxides of copper are found in Cornwall, Siberia, and in North and  South America.         _Oxide_, a substance combined with Oxygen,[8] in a       proportion not sufficient to produce acidity.         _Sulphuret_, a combination of sulphur with a base.    [Footnote 8: See Chapter XIII., article Oxygen.]      What are the uses of Copper?    They are too various to be enumerated. In sheets it is much used to  sheathe the bottoms of ships, for boilers, and other utensils. Copper  coin was the only money used by the Romans till the 485th year of  their city, when silver began to be coined. In Sweden, houses are  covered with this metal.      What is a Mine?    A cavity under ground, formed for the purpose of obtaining metals,  &c.; mines are often very deep and extensive. The descent into them is  by a pit, called a shaft; the clues by which mines are discovered,  are, mineral springs, the discoloration of vegetables, the appearance  of pieces of ore, &c.         _Clues_, signs or means by which things hidden are brought       to light.      What is Brass?    A factitious metal, consisting of copper and zinc. Brass is lighter  and harder than pure copper, and less subject to rust; owing to these  properties, together with its beautiful color, it is extremely useful  in the manufacture of many utensils.         _Factitious_, made by art, not found in a natural state.      What is Zinc?    A metal of a brilliant bluish white color. Its name was unknown to the  ancient Greeks and Arabians. It is mixed with other substances in the  ore, from which it is obtained by smelting in the furnace. It has  never yet been found native or pure.      For what is Zinc used?    From its readiness to dissolve in all acids, and unite with other  metals, it is used in alloy with them in the composition of brass, &c.  Thin sheets of zinc are also used to cover roofs of houses, and in the  manufacture of various household utensils.      What is Lapis Calaminaris?    Lapis Calaminaris, or calamine stone, is a native carbonate of zinc,  of some use in medicine, but chiefly in founding. It is, sometimes  brownish, as that found in Germany and England, or red, as that of  France. It is dug out of mines, usually in small pieces; generally out  of those of lead. Calamine is mostly found in barren, rocky soils.    _Founding_, the art of casting metals.          CHAPTER XI.    YAMS, MANGOES, BREAD-FRUIT, SHEA OR BUTTER TREE, COW TREE, WATER  TREE, LICORICE, MANNA, OPIUM, TOBACCO, AND GUM.      What are Yams?    The roots of a climbing plant growing in tropical climates. The root  of the yam is wholesome and well-flavored; nearly as large as a man's  leg, and of an irregular form. Yams are much used for food in those  countries where they grow; the natives either roast or boil them, and  the white people grind them into flour, of which they make bread and  puddings. The yam is of a dirty brown color outside, but white and  mealy within.      What are Mangoes?    The fruit of the Mango Tree, a native of India and the south-western  parts of Asia; it also grows abundantly in the West Indies and Brazil.  It was introduced into Jamaica in 1782; where it attains the height of  thirty or forty feet, with thick and wide-extended branches. The  varieties of the mango are very numerous,--upwards of eighty are  cultivated; and the quality of these varies according to the countries  and situations in which they grow. The mangoes of Asia are said to be  much better than those of America.      Describe the appearance of the Mango Tree.    The flowers of this tree are small and whitish, formed in pyramidal  clusters. The fruit has some resemblance to a short thick cucumber,  about the size of a goose's egg; its taste is delicious and cooling;  it has a stone in the centre, like that of a peach. At first this  fruit is of a fine green color, and some varieties continue so, while  others change to a fine golden or orange color. The mango tree is an  evergreen, bearing fruit once or twice a year, from six or seven years  old to a hundred.    _Pyramidal_, resembling a pyramid.      How is this fruit eaten?    When ripe, it is eaten by the natives either in its natural state, or  bruised in wine. It is brought to us either candied or pickled, as the  ripe fruit is very perishable; in the latter case, they are opened  with a knife, and the middle filled up with fresh ginger, garlic,  mustard, salt, and oil or vinegar. The fruit of the largest variety  weighs two pounds or upwards. The several parts of this tree are all  applied to some use by the Hindoos: the wood is consecrated to the  service of the dead; from the flour of the dried kernels different  kinds of food are prepared; the leaves, flowers, and bark, are  medicinal.    _Medicinal_, fit for medicine, possessing medical properties.    _Consecrated_, separated from a common to a sacred use.      Is there not a tree which bears a fruit that may be used for bread?    Yes; the Bread-fruit Tree, originally found in the southeastern parts  of Asia and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, though introduced into  the tropical parts of America. It is one of the most interesting, as  well as singular productions of the vegetable kingdom, being no less  beautiful than it is useful. This tree is large and shady; its leaves  are broad and indented, like those of the fig tree--from twelve to  eighteen inches long, rather fleshy, and of a dark green. The fruit,  when full-grown, is from six to nine inches round, and of an oval  form--when ripe, of a rich, yellow tinge; it generally hangs in  clusters of two or three, on a small thick stalk; the pulp is white,  partly farinaceous, and partly fibrous, but when ripe, becomes yellow  and juicy.         _Indented_, toothed like the edge of a saw.         _Farinaceous_, mealy, consisting of meal or flour; from       _farina_, flour.      How is the Bread-Fruit eaten?    It is roasted until the outside is of a brown color and crisp; the  pulp has then the consistency of bread, which the taste greatly  resembles; and thus it forms a nourishing food: it is also"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16737"],[0,"International Language, Past, Present & Future (#14)"],[1,"the etymological sense of the word, _world_  (and not merely European) citizenship, will shift the _onus probandi_  from the supporters of an international language to its opponents.  It will say to them, \"It is admitted that you have much intercourse  with other peoples; it is admitted that diversity of language is an  obstacle in this intercourse; this obstacle is increasing rather than  diminishing as fresh subjects raise their claims upon the few years of  education, and the old leisurely type of linguistic education fails  more and more to train the bulk of the people for life's business,  and as the ranks of the civilized are swelled by fresh peoples for  whom it is harder and harder to learn even one Indo-Germanic tongue,  let alone several; it is proved that this obstacle can be removed  at the cost of a few months' study: this study is not only the most  directly remunerative study in the world, comparing results with cost,  but it is an admirable mental discipline and a direct help towards  further real linguistic culture-giving studies for those who are fit  to undertake them. Show cause, then, why you prefer to suffer under  an unnecessary obstacle, rather than avail yourselves of this means  of removing it.\" It is easier for the Indo-Germanic peoples to learn  each other's languages--e.g. for an Englishman to learn Swedish or  Russian--than it is for a speaker of one of any of the other families of  languages to learn any Indo-Germanic tongue; so that some idea may be  formed of the magnitude of the task imposed upon the newer converts to  Western civilization by the Indo-Germanic world, in making them learn  one or more of its national languages. At the same time, it is but just  that the peoples who have paid the piper of progress should call the  common lingual tune. Therefore, what more fitting than that they should  provide an essence of their allied languages, reduced to its simplest  and clearest form? This they would offer to the rest of the world to  be taken over as part of the general progress in civilization which it  has to adopt; and this it is which is provided in the international  language, Esperanto.                                        XVII             IMPORTANCE OF AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE FOR THE BLIND    Now that higher education for the blind is being extended in every  country, owing to the more humanitarian feeling of the present age  that these afflicted members of the community ought to be given a fair  chance, the problem of supplying them with books is beginning to be  felt. The process of producing books for the blind on the Braille system  is, of course, far more costly than ordinary printing, and at the same  time the editions must be necessarily more or less limited. Many an  educated blind person is therefore cruelly circumscribed in the range  of literature open to him by the mere physical obstacle of the lack of  books. This difficulty is accentuated by the fact that three kinds of  Braille type are in use--French, English, and American.    Now, suppose it is desired to make the works of some good author  accessible to the blind--we will say the works of Milton. A separate  edition has to be done into Braille for the English, another separate  translation for the French, and so on for the blind of each country.  In many cases where translations of a work do not already exist, as in  the case of a modern author, the mere cost of translation into some  one language may not pay, much less then the preparation of a special  Braille edition for the limited blind public of that country. But if one  Braille edition is prepared for the blind of the world in the universal  auxiliary language, a far greater range of literature is at once brought  within their grasp.    Already there is abundant evidence of the keen appreciation of Esperanto  on the part of the blind, and one striking proof is the fact that the  distinguished French scientist and doctor, Dr. Javal, who himself became  blind during the latter part of his life, was, until his death in March  1907, one of the foremost partisans and benefactors of Esperanto. By  his liberality much has been rendered possible that could not otherwise  have been accomplished. There are many other devoted workers in the same  field, among them Prof. Cart and Mme. Fauvart-Bastoul in France, and Mr.  Rhodes, of Keighley, and Mr. Adams, of Hastings, in England. A special  fund is being raised to enable blind Esperantists from various countries  to attend the Congress at Cambridge in August 1907, and the cause is one  well worthy of assistance by all who are interested in the welfare of  the blind. The day when a universal language is practically recognised  will be one of the greatest in their annals.    A perfectly phonetic language, as is Esperanto, is peculiarly suited  to the needs of the blind. Its long, full vowels, slow, harmonious  intonation, few and simple sounds, and regular construction make it very  easy to learn through the ear, and to reproduce on any phonetic system  of notation; and as a matter of fact, blind people are found to enjoy  it much. For a blind man to come to an international congress and be  able to compare notes with his fellow-blind from all over the world must  be a lifting of the veil between him and the outer world, coming next  to receiving his sight. To witness this spectacle alone might almost  convince a waverer as to the utility of the common language.                                       XVIII                              IDEAL _v._ PRACTICAL    From the early days of the Esperanto movement there has flowed within it  a sort of double current. There is the warm and genial Gulf Stream of  Idealism, that raises the temperature on every shore to which it sets,  and calls forth a luxuriant growth of friendly sentiment. This tends to  the enriching of life. There is also the cooler current of practicality,  with a steady drive towards material profit. At present the tide is  flowing free, and, taken at the flood, may lead on to fortune; the two  currents pursue their way harmoniously within it, without clashing, and  sometimes mingling their waters to their mutual benefit.    But as the movement is sometimes dismissed contemptuously as a pacifist  fad or an unattainable ideal of universal brotherhood, it is as well  to set the matter in its true light. It is true that the inventor of  Esperanto, Dr. Zamenhof, of Warsaw, is an idealist in the best sense of  the word, and that his language was directly inspired by his ardent wish  to remove one cause of misunderstanding in his distracted country. He  has persistently refused to make any profit out of it, and declined to  accept a sum which some enthusiasts collected as a testimonial to his  disinterested work.    It is equally true that Esperanto seems to possess a rather strange  power of evoking enthusiasm. Meetings of Esperantists are invariably  characterized by great cordiality and good-fellowship, and at the  international congresses so far these feelings have at times risen  to fever heat. It is easy to make fun of this by saying that the  conjunction of Sirius, the fever-shedding constellation of the ancients,  with the green star[1] in the dog days of August, when the congresses  are held, induces hot fits. Those who have drunk enthusiastic toasts  in common, and have rubbed shoulders and compared notes with various  foreigners, and gone home having made perhaps lifelong interesting  friendships which bring them in touch with other lands, will not  undervalue the brotherhood aspect of the common language.       [1]Badge of the Esperantists.    On the other hand, the united Esperantists at their first international  meeting expressly and formally dissociated their project from any  connection with political, sentimental, or peace-making schemes. They  did this by drawing up and promulgating a \"Deklaracio,\" adopted by the  Esperantist world, wherein it is declared that Esperanto is a language,  and a language only.[1] It is not a league or a society or agency for  promoting any object whatsoever other than its own dissemination as a  means of communication. Like other tongues, Esperanto may be used for  any purpose whatsoever, and it is declared that a man is equally an  Esperantist whether he uses the language to save life or to kill, to  further his own selfish ends or to labour in any altruistic cause.[2]       [1]For text of this Declaration, see Part II., chap. vii., p. 115.       [2]The non-sectarian nature of Esperanto is shown by the fact that     the first two services in the language were held on the same day     in Geneva according to the Roman Catholic and Protestant rites.     The latter was conducted by an English clergyman, whose striking     sermon on unity, in spite of diversity, evidently impressed his     international congregation. The Vatican has officially expressed     its favour towards Esperanto, and the Archbishop of Canterbury has     sanctioned an Esperanto form of the Anglican service, which will     be used in London and Cambridge this summer. Cordial goodwill was     expressed towards the Vatican, on receipt of its message at Geneva,     by speakers who avowed themselves agnostics, but welcomed any advance     towards abolition of barriers.    The practical nature of the scheme which Esperantists are labouring to  induce the world to adopt is thus sufficiently clearly defined. Dr.  Zamenhof himself, speaking at the Geneva Congress with all the vivid  poignancy attaching to the words of a man fresh from the butcheries  at that moment rife in the Russian Empire,[1] declared that neither  he nor other Esperantists were _naifs_ enough to believe that the  adoption of their language would put an end to such scenes. But he had  _seen_ men at each other's throats, beating each other's brains out with  bludgeons--men who had no personal enmity and had never seen each other  before, but were let loose on each"]]]
