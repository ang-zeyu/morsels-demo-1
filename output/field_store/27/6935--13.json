At first, the only essential difference in the methods of brewing this  liquor and that of other kinds of beer, was, that porter was brewed from  brown malt only; and this gave to it both the colour and flavour  required. Of late years it has been brewed from mixtures of pale and  brown malt.    These, at some establishments, are mashed separately, and the worts from  each are afterwards mixed together. The proportion of pale and brown  malt, used for brewing porter, varies in different breweries; some  employ nearly two parts of pale malt and one part of brown malt; but  each brewer appears to have his own proportion; which the intelligent  manufacturer varies, according to the nature and qualities of the malt.  Three pounds of hops are, upon an average, allowed to every barrel,  (thirty-six gallons) of porter.    When the price of malt, on account of the great increase in the price of  barley during the late war, was very high, the London brewers discovered  that a larger quantity of wort of a given strength could be obtained  from pale malt than from brown malt. They therefore increased the  quantity of the former and diminished that of the latter. This produced  beer of a paler colour, and of a less bitter flavour. To remedy these  disadvantages, they invented an artificial colouring substance, prepared  by boiling brown sugar till it acquired a very dark brown colour; a  solution of which was employed to darken the colour of the beer. Some  brewers made use of the infusion of malt instead of sugar colouring. To  impart to the beer a bitter taste, the fraudulent brewer employed  quassia wood and wormwood as a substitute for hops.    But as the colouring of beer by means of sugar became in many instances  a pretext for using illegal ingredients, the Legislature, apprehensive  from the mischief that might, and actually did, result from it, passed  an Act prohibiting the use of burnt sugar, in July 1817; and nothing but  malt and hops is now allowed to enter into the composition of beer: even  the use of isinglass for clarifying beer, is contrary to law.    No sooner had the beer-colouring Act been repealed, than other persons  obtained a patent for effecting the purpose of imparting an artificial  colour to porter, by means of brown malt, specifically prepared for that  purpose only. The beer, coloured by the new method, is more liable to  become spoiled, than when coloured by the process formerly practised.  The colouring malt does not contain any considerable portion of  saccharine matter. The grain is by mere torrefaction converted into a  gum-like substance, wholly soluble in water, which renders the beer  more liable to pass into the acetous fermentation than the common brown  malt is capable of doing; because the latter, if prepared from good  barley, contains a portion of saccharine matter, of which the patent  malt is destitute.    But as brown malt is generally prepared from the worst kind of barley,  and as the patent malt can only be made from good grain, it may become,  on that account, an useful article to the brewer (at least, it gives  colour and body to the beer;) but it cannot materially economise the  quantity of malt necessary to produce good porter. Some brewers of  eminence in this town have assured me, that the use of this mode of  colouring beer is wholly unnecessary; and that porter of the requisite  colour may be brewed better without it; hence this kind of malt is not  used in their establishments. The quantity of gum-like matter which it  contains, gives too much ferment to the beer, and renders it liable to  spoil. Repeated experiments, made on a large scale, have settled this  fact.      STRENGTH AND SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PORTER.    The strength of all kinds of beer, like that of wine, depends on the  quantity of spirit contained in a given bulk of the liquor.    The reader need scarcely be told, that of no article there are more  varieties than of porter. This, no doubt, arises from the different mode  of manufacturing the beer, although the ingredients are the same. This  difference is more striking in the porter manufactured among country  brewers, than it is in the beer brewed by the eminent London porter  brewers. The totality of the London porter exhibits but very slight  differences, both with respect to strength or quantity of spirit, and  solid extractive matter, contained in a given bulk of it. The spirit may  be stated, upon an average, to be 4,50 per cent. in porter retailed at  the publicans; the solid matter, is from twenty-one to twenty-three  pounds per barrel of thirty-six gallons. The country-brewed porter is  seldom well fermented, and seldom contains so large a quantity of  spirit; it usually abounds in mucilage; hence it becomes turbid when  mixed with alcohol. Such beer cannot keep, without becoming sour.    It has been matter of frequent complaint, that ALL the porter  now brewed, is not what porter was formerly. This idea may be true with  some exceptions. My professional occupations have, during these  twenty-eight years, repeatedly obliged me to examine the strength of  London porter, brewed by different brewers; and, from the minutes made  on that subject, I am authorised to state, that the porter now brewed by  the eminent London brewers, is unquestionably stronger than that which  was brewed at different periods during the late French war. Samples of  brown stout with which I have been obligingly favoured, whilst writing  this Treatise, by Messrs. Barclay, Perkins, and Co.--Messrs. Truman,  Hanbury, and Co.--Messrs. Henry Meux and Co.--and other eminent brewers  of this capital--afforded, upon an average, 7,25 per cent. of alcohol,  of 0,833 specific gravity; and porter, from the same houses, yielded  upon an average 5,25 per cent. of alcohol, of the same specific  gravity;[55] this beer received from the brewers was taken from the  same store from which the publicans are supplied.    It is nevertheless singular to observe, that from fifteen samples of  beer of the same denominations, procured from different retailers, the  proportions of spirit fell considerably short of the above quantities.  Samples of brown stout, procured from the retailers, afforded, upon an  average, 6,50 per cent. of alcohol; and the average strength of the  porter was 4,50 per cent. Whence can this difference between the beer  furnished by the brewer, and that retailed by the publican, arise? We  shall not be at a loss to answer this question, when we find that so  many retailers of porter have been prosecuted and convicted for mixing  table beer with their strong beer; this is prohibited by law, as becomes  obvious by the following words of the Act.[56]    \"If any common or other brewer, innkeeper, victualler, or retailer of  beer or ale, shall mix or suffer to be mixed any strong beer, ale, or  worts, with table beer, worts, or water, in any tub or measure, he shall  forfeit 50_l._\" The difference between strong and table beer, is thus  settled by Parliament.    \"All beer or ale[57] above the price of eighteen shillings per barrel,  exclusive of ale duties now payable (viz. ten shillings per barrel,) or  that may be hereafter payable in respect thereof, shall be deemed strong  beer or ale; and all beer of the price of eighteen shillings the barrel  or under, exclusive of the duty payable (viz. two shillings per barrel)  in respect thereof, shall be deemed table beer within the meaning of  this and all other Acts now in force, or that may hereafter be passed in  relation to beer or ale or any duties thereon.\"      _List of Publicans prosecuted and convicted from 1815 to 1818, for  adulterating Beer with illegal Ingredients,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#14)"],[1,"but hereditary, and attached to the office of the King of  Prussia. Outside of Prussia he has little power in civil matters and  no veto on legislation. He is commander-in-chief of the army and of  the navy; foreign affairs are in his hands, and in the federal  council, or Bundesrath, he exercises a mighty influence due to  Prussia's preponderating influence and voting power. There is no  cabinet, just as there is no cabinet in Great Britain, that modern  institution being merely a legislative fiction down to this day. The  chancellor of the empire, who is also prime minister of Prussia, with  several secretaries of state, is chief minister for all imperial  affairs. The chancellor presides in the Bundesrath, and has the right  to speak in the Reichstag, and frequently does speak there. Indeed,  all his more important pronouncements are made there. The chancellor  is responsible to the Emperor alone, by whom he is nominated, and not  to the representatives of the people.    The federal council, or Bundesrath, or upper chamber of the empire,  consists of delegates appointed by and representing the rulers of the  various states. There are 58 members. Prussia has 17, Bavaria 6,  Saxony 4, Wuertemberg 4, Baden 3, Hessen 3, Mecklenburg-Schwerin 2,  Brunswick 2, and each of the other states 1.    This body meets in Berlin, sits in secret, and the delegates have no  discretion, but vote as directed by their state governments. Here it  is that Prussia, and through Prussia the Emperor, dominates. This  Bundesrath is the most powerful upper chamber in the world. With  respect to all laws concerning the army and navy, and taxation for  imperial purposes, the vote of Prussia shall decide disputes, if such  vote be cast in favor of maintaining existing arrangements. In other  words, Prussia is armed in the Bundesrath with a conservative veto! In  declaring war and making treaties, the consent of the Bundesrath is  required. The following articles also give the Bundesrath a very  complete control of the Reichstag. Article 7 reads: \"The Bundesrath  shall take action upon (1) the measures to be proposed to the  Reichstag and the resolutions passed by the same; (2) the general  administrative provisions and arrangements necessary for the execution  of the imperial laws, so far as no other provision is made by law; (3)  the defects which may be discovered in the execution of the imperial  laws or of the provisions and arrangements heretofore mentioned.\"    The Reichstag, or lower house, is elected by universal suffrage in  electoral districts which were originally equal, but as we have noted  are far from equal now. This house has three hundred and ninety-seven  members, of whom two hundred and thirty-five are from Prussia. It sits  for five years, but may be dissolved by the Bundesrath with the  consent of the Emperor. All members of the Bundesrath, as well as the  chancellor, may speak in the Reichstag. Nor the chancellor, nor any  other executive officer, is responsible to the Reichstag, nor can be  removed by its vote, and the ministers of the Emperor are seldom or  never chosen from this body. This Reichstag is really only nominally a  portion of the governing body. It has the right to refuse to pass a  bill presented by the government, but if it does so it may be  summarily dismissed, as has happened several times, and another  election usually provides a more amenable body.    Of the various political parties in the Reichstag we have written  elsewhere. It is, perhaps, fair to say that such powerful parties as  the Socialists and the Centrum must be reckoned with by the  chancellor. He cannot actually trample upon them, nor can he disregard  wholly their wishes in framing and in carrying through legislation. It  would be going much too far in characterizing the weakness of the  Reichstag to leave that impression upon the reader. None the less it  remains true that it is the executive who rules and has the whip-hand,  and who in a grave crisis can override the representatives of the  people assembled in the Reichstag, and on more than one occasion this  has been done.    It seems highly unnecessary to announce after this description of the  imperial constitution that there is no such thing in Germany as  democratic or representative government. But this fact cannot be  proclaimed too often since in other countries it is continually  assumed that this is the case. All sorts of deductions are made, all  sorts of illustrations used, all sorts of legislative and social  lessons taught from the example of Germany, without the smallest  knowledge apparently on the part of those who make them, that Germany  to-day is no more democratic than was Turkey twenty years ago.    What can be done and what is done in Germany has no possible bearing  upon what can be done in America or in England. All analogies are  false, all illustrations futile, all examples valueless, for the one  reason that the empire of Germany is governed by one man, who declaims  his independence of the people and admits his responsibility to God  alone. This may be either a good or a bad thing. Certainly in many  matters of economical and comfortable government for the people--  witness more particularly the development and wise control of their  municipalities--they are a century ahead of us, but this is not the  question under discussion. The point is, that a compact nation under  strict centralized control, served by a trained horde of officials  with no wish for a change, and backed by a standing army of over seven  hundred thousand men, who are not only a defence against the  foreigner, but a powerful police against internal revolution, cannot  serve as a model in either its successes or failures for a democratic  country like ours. Where in Germany legislative schemes succeed easily  when this huge bureaucratic machine is behind them, they would fail  ignominiously in a country lacking this machinery, and lacking these  pitiably tame people accustomed to submission.    In France, for example, that thrifty and individualistic folk made a  complete failure of the attempt to foist contributory old-age pensions  upon them, and I doubt whether such sumptuary legislation can succeed  with us. That, however, is neither here nor there. The gist of the  matter is, that because such things succeed in Germany, gives not the  slightest reason for supposing that they will succeed with us. If this  outline of their history and this sketch of their government have done  nothing else, it must have made this clear. It may also help to show  how vapid is the talk about what the German people will or will not  do; whether they will or will not have war, for example. We shall have  war when the German Kaiser touches a button and gives an order, and  the German people will have no more to say in the matter than you and I.        III THE INDISCREET      The casual observer of life in England would find himself forced to  write of sport, even as in India he would write of caste, as in  America he would note the undue emphasis laid upon politics. In  Germany, wherever he turns, whether it be to look at the army, to  inquire about the navy, to study the constitution, or to disentangle  the web of present-day political strife; to read the figures of  commercial and industrial progress, or the results of social  legislation; to look on at the Germans at play during their yachting  week at Kiel, or their rowing contests at Frankfort, he finds himself  face to face with the Emperor.    The student visits Berlin, or Potsdam, or Wilhelmshoehe; or with a long  stride finds himself on the docks at Hamburg or Bremen, or beside the  Kiel Canal, or in Kiel harbor facing a fleet of war-ships; or he lifts  his eyes into the air to see a dirigible balloon returning from a  voyage of two hundred and fifty miles toward London over the North  Sea, and the Emperor is there. Is it the palace hidden in its  shrubbery in the country; is it the clean, broad streets and  decorations of the capital; is it a discussion of domestic politics,  or a question of foreign politics, the Emperor's hand is there. His  opinion, his influence, what he has said or has not said, are  inextricably interwoven with the woof and web of German life.    We may like him or dislike him, approve or disapprove, rejoice in  autocracy or abominate it, admire the far-reaching discipline, or  regret the iron mould in which much of German life is encased, but for  the moment all this is beside the mark. Here is a man who in a quarter  of a century has so grown into the life of a nation, the most powerful  on the continent, and one of the three most powerful in the world,  that when you touch it anywhere you touch him, and when you think of  it from any angle of thought, or describe it from any point of view,  you find yourself including him.    Personally, I should have been glad to leave this chapter unwritten. I  have no taste for the discussion and analysis of living persons, even  when they are of such historic and social importance, and of such  magnitude, that I am thus given the proverbial license of the cat. But  to write about Germany without writing about the Emperor is as  impossible as to jump away from one's own shadow. When the sun is  behind any phase or department of German life, the shadow cast is that  of Germany's Emperor.    This is not said because it is pleasing to whomsoever it may be, for  in Germany, and in much of the world outside Germany, this situation  is looked upon as unfavorable, and even deplorable; and certainly no  American can look upon it with equanimity, for it is of the essence of  his Americanism to distrust it. It is, however, so much a fact that to  neglect a discussion of this personality would be to leave even so  slight a sketch of Germany as this, hopelessly lop-sided. He so  pervades German life that to write of the Germany of the last twenty-five  years without attempting to"]]]
