Through all those trial  years he was pouring forth his soul in devout verses, making in all no  less than a hundred and twenty-five hymns--every one of them a comfort  to others as well as to himself.    He became a favorite, and for a time _the_ favorite, hymn-writer of all  the German-speaking people. Among these tones of calm faith and joy we  recognize today (in the English tongue),--        Since Jesus is my Friend,        Thee, O Immanuel, we praise,        All my heart this night rejoices,        How shall I meet Thee,    --and the English translation of his \"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden,\"  turned into German by himself from St. Bernard Clairvaux's \"Salve caput  cruentatum,\" and made dear to us in Rev. James Alexander's beautiful  lines--        O sacred head now wounded,        With grief and shame weighed down,      Now scornfully surrounded        With thorns, Thine only crown.      _THE TUNE._    A plain-song by Alexander Reinagle is used by some congregations, but is  not remarkably expressive. Reinagle, Alexander Robert, (1799-1877) of  Kidlington, Eng., was organist to the church of St. Peter-in-the-East,  Oxford.    The great \"Hymn of Trust\" could have found no more sympathetic  interpreter than the musician of Gerhardt's own land and language,  Schumann, the gentle genius of Zwickau. It bears the name \"Schumann,\"  appropriately enough, and its elocution makes a volume of each quatrain,  notably the one--        Who points the clouds their course,        Whom wind and seas obey;      He shall direct thy wandering feet,        He shall prepare thy way.    Robert Schumann, Ph.D., was born in Zwickau, Saxony, June 8, 1810. He  was a music director and conservatory teacher, and the master-mind of  the pre-Wagnerian period. His compositions became popular, having a  character of their own, combining the intellectual and beautiful in art.  He published in Leipsic a journal promotive of his school of music, and  founded a choral society in Dresden. Happy in the cooeperation of his  wife, herself a skilled musician, he extended his work to Vienna and the  Netherlands; but his zeal wore him out, and he died at the age of  forty-six, universally lamented as \"the eminent man who had done so much  for the happiness of others.\"    Gerhardt's Hymn (ten quatrains) is rarely printed entire, and where six  are printed only four are usually sung. Different collections choose  portions according to the compiler's taste, the stanza beginning--        Give to the winds thy fears,    --being with some a favorite first verse.    The translation of the hymn from the German is John Wesley's.    Purely legendary is the beautiful story of the composition of the hymn,  \"Commit thou all thy griefs\"; how, after his exile from Berlin,  traveling on foot with his weeping wife, Gerhardt stopped at a wayside  inn and wrote the lines while he rested; and how a messenger from Duke  Christian found him there, and offered him a home in Meresburg. But the  most ordinary imagination can fill in the possible incidents in a life  of vicissitudes such as Gerhardt's was.      LADY HUNTINGDON.    \"When Thou My Righteous Judge Shalt Come.\"    Selina Shirley, Countess of Huntingdon, born 1707, died 1791, is  familiarly known as the titled friend and patroness of Whitefield and  his fellow-preachers. She early consecrated herself to God, and in the  great spiritual awakening under Whitefield and the Wesleys she was a  punctual and sympathetic helper. Uniting with the Calvinistic  Methodists, she nevertheless stood aloof from none who preached a  personal Christ, and whose watchwords were the salvation of souls and  the purification of the Church. For more than fifty years she devoted  her wealth to benevolence and spiritual ministries, and died at the age  of eighty-four. \"I have done my work,\" was her last testimony. \"I have  nothing to do but to go to my Father.\"    At various times Lady Huntingdon expressed her religious experience in  verse, and the manful vigor of her school of faith recalls the unbending  confidence of Job, for she was not a stranger to affliction.        God's furnace doth in Zion stand,        But Zion's God sits by,      As the refiner views his gold,        With an observant eye.        His thoughts are high, His love is wise,        His wounds a cure intend;      And, though He does not always smile,        He loves unto the end.    Her great hymn, that keeps her memory green, has the old-fashioned  flavor. \"Massa made God BIG!\" was the comment on Dr. Bellany made by his  old negro servant after that noted minister's death. In Puritan piety  the sternest self-depreciation qualified every thought of the creature,  while every allusion to the Creator was a magnificat. Lady Huntingdon's  hymn has no flattering phrases for the human subject. \"Worthless worm,\"  and \"vilest of them all\" indicate the true Pauline or Oriental  prostration of self before a superior being; but there is grandeur in  the metre, the awful reverence, and the scene of judgment in the  stanzas--always remembering the mighty choral that has so long given the  lyric its voice in the church, and is ancillary to its fame:        When Thou, my righteous Judge, shalt come      To take Thy ransomed people home,        Shall I among them stand?      Shall such a worthless worm as I,      Who sometimes am afraid to die,        Be found at Thy right hand?        I love to meet Thy people now,      Before Thy feet with them to bow,        Though vilest of them all;      But can I bear the piercing thought,      What if my name should be left out,        When Thou for them shalt call?        O Lord, prevent it by Thy grace:      Be Thou my only hiding place,        In this th' accepted day;      Thy pardoning voice, oh let me hear,      To still my unbelieving fear,        Nor let me fall, I pray.        Among Thy saints let me be found,      Whene'er the archangel's trump shall sound,        To see Thy smiling face;      Then loudest of the throng I'll sing,      While heaven's resounding arches ring        With shouts of sovereign grace.      _THE TUNE._    The tune of \"Meribah,\" in which this hymn has been sung for the last  sixty or more years, is one of Dr. Lowell Mason's masterpieces. An  earlier German harmony attributed to Heinrich Isaac and named  \"Innsbruck\" has in some few cases claimed association with the words,  though composed two hundred years before Lady Huntingdon was born. It is  strong and solemn, but its cold psalm-tune movement does not utter the  deep emotion of the author's lines. \"Meribah\" was inspired by the hymn  itself, and there is nothing invidious in saying it illustrates the  fact, memorable in all hymnology, of the natural obligation of a hymn to  its tune.    Apropos of both, it is related that Mason was once presiding at choir  service in a certain church where the minister gave out \"When thou my  righteous Judge shalt come\" and by mistake directed the singers to \"omit  the second stanza.\" Mason sat at the organ, and while playing the last  strain, \"Be found at thy right hand,\" glanced ahead in the hymnbook and  turned with a start just in time to command, \"Sing the _next_ verse!\"  The choir did so, and \"O Lord, prevent it by Thy grace!\" was saved from  being a horrible prayer to be kept out of heaven.      ZINZENDORF.    \"Jesus, Thy Blood and Righteousness.\"    Nicolaus Ludwig, Count Von Zinzendorf, was born at Dresden, May 26,  1700, and educated at Halle and Wittenberg. From his youth he evinced  marked seriousness of mind, and deep religious sensibilities, and this  character appeared in his sympathy with the persecuted Moravians, to  whom he gave domicile and domain on his large estate. For eleven years  he was Councillor to the Elector of Saxony, but subsequently, uniting  with the Brethren's Church, he founded the settlement of Herrnhut, the  first home and refuge of the reorganized sect, and became a Moravian  minister and bishop.    Zinzendorf was a man of high culture, as well as profound and sincere  piety and in his hymns (of which he wrote more than two thousand) he  preached Christ as eloquently as with his voice. The real birth-moment  of his religious life is said to have been simultaneous with his study  of the \"Ecce Homo\" in the Dusseldorf Gallery, a wonderful painting of  Jesus crowned with thorns. Visiting the gallery one day when a young  man, he gazed on the sacred face and read the legend superscribed, \"All  this I have done for thee; What doest thou for me?\" Ever afterwards his  motto was \"I have but one passion, and that is He, and only He\"--a  version of Paul's \"For me to live is Christ.\"        Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness      My beauty are, my glorious dress:     'Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,      With joy shall I lift up my head.        Bold shall I stand in Thy great day,      For who aught to my charge shall lay?      Fully absolved through these I am--      From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.        Lord, I believe were sinners more      Than sands upon the ocean shore,      Thou hast for all a ransom paid,      For all a full atonement made.    Nearly all the hymns of the great Moravian are now out of general use,  having accomplished their mission, like the forgotten ones of Gerhardt,  and been superseded by others. More sung in Europe, probably, now than  any of the survivors is, \"Jesus, geh voran,\" (\"Jesus, lead on,\") which  has been translated into English by Jane Borthwick[8] (1854). Two  others, both translated by John Wesley, are with us, the one above  quoted, and \"Glory to God, whose witness train.\" \"Jesus, Thy blood,\"  which is the best known, frequently appears with the alteration--        Jesus, Thy _robe_ of righteousness      My beauty _is_, my glorious dress.    [Footnote 8: Born in Edinburgh 1813.]      _THE TUNE._    \"Malvern,\" and \"Uxbridge\" a pure Gregorian, both by Lowell Mason, are  common expressions of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#14)"],[1,"above.    \"Now,\" said Rodolphe, \"there is no drawing back. We have burnt our  ships, and we have before us just a week to find the hundred francs that  are indispensable to do the thing properly.\"    \"Since we must have them, we shall,\" replied Marcel.    And with the insolent confidence which they had in luck, the two friends  went to sleep, convinced that their hundred francs were already on the  way, the way of impossibility.    However, as on the day before that appointed for the party, nothing as  of yet had turned up, Rodolphe thought perhaps, be safer to give luck a  helping hand, unless he were to be discredited forever, when the time  came to light up. To facilitate matters the two friends progressively  modified the sumptuosity of the program they had imposed upon  themselves.    And proceeding from modification to modification, after having seriously  reduced the item \"cakes,\" and carefully revised and pruned down the item  \"liquors,\" the total cost was reduced to fifteen francs.    The problem was simplified, but not yet solved.    \"Come, come,\" said Rodolphe, \"we must now have recourse to strong  measures, we cannot cry off this time.\"    \"No, that is impossible,\" replied Marcel.    \"How long is it since I have heard the story of the Battle of  Studzianka?\"    \"About two months.\"    \"Two months, good, that is a decent interval; my uncle will have no  ground for grumbling. I will go tomorrow and hear his account of that  engagement, that will be five francs for certain.\"    \"I,\" said Marcel, \"will go and sell a deserted manor house to old  Medicis. That will make another five francs. If I have time enough to  put in three towers and a mill, it will perhaps run to ten francs, and  our budget will be complete.\"    And the two friends fell asleep dreaming that the Princess Belgiojoso  begged them to change their reception day, in order not to rob her of  her customary guests.    Awake at dawn, Marcel took a canvas and rapidly set to work to build up  a deserted manor house, an article which he was in the habit of  supplying to a broker of the Place de Carrousel. On his side, Rodolphe  went to pay a visit to his Uncle Monetti, who shone in the story of the  Retreat from Moscow, and to whom Rodolphe accorded five or six times in  course of the year, when matters were really serious, the satisfaction  of narrating his campaigns, in return for a small loan which the veteran  stove maker did not refuse too obstinately when due enthusiasm was  displayed in listening to his narrations.    About two o'clock, Marcel with hanging head and a canvas under his arm,  met on the Place de Carrousel Rodolphe, who was returning from his  uncle's, and whose bearing also presaged ill news.    \"Well,\" asked Marcel, \"did you succeed?\"    \"No, my uncle has gone to Versailles. And you?\"    \"That beast of a Medicis does not want any more ruined manor houses. He  wants me to do him a Bombardment of Tangiers.\"    \"Our reputations are ruined forever if we do not give this party,\"  murmured Rodolphe. \"What will my friend, the influential critic, think  if I make him put on a white tie and yellow kids for nothing.\"    And both went back to the studio, a prey to great uneasiness.    At that moment the clock of a neighbor struck four.    \"We have only three hours before us,\" said Rodolphe despondingly.    \"But,\" said Marcel, going up to his friend, \"are you quite sure, certain  sure, that we have no money left anywhere hereabout? Eh?\"    \"Neither here, nor elsewhere. Where do you suppose it could come from?\"    \"If we looked under the furniture, in the stuffing of the arm chairs?  They say that the emigrant noblemen used to hide their treasures in the  days of Robespierre. Who can tell? Perhaps our arm chair belonged to an  emigrant nobleman, and besides, it is so hard that the idea has often  occurred to me that it must be stuffed with metal. Will you dissect it?\"    \"This is mere comedy,\" replied Rodolphe, in a tone in which severity was  mingled with indulgence.    Suddenly Marcel, who had gone on rummaging in every corner of the  studio, uttered a loud cry of triumph.    \"We are saved!\" he exclaimed. \"I was sure that there was money here.  Behold!\" and he showed Rodolphe a coin as large as a crown piece, and  half eaten away by rust and verdigris.    It was a Carlovingian coin of some artistic value. The legend, happily  intact, showed the date of Charlemagne's reign.    \"That, that's worth thirty sous,\" said Rodolphe, with a contemptuous  glance at his friend's find.    \"Thirty sous well employed will go a great way,\" replied Marcel. \"With  twelve hundred men Bonaparte made ten thousand Austrians lay down their  arms. Skill can replace numbers. I will go and swap the Carlovingian  crown at Daddy Medicis'. Is there not anything else saleable here?  Suppose I take the plaster cast of the tibia of Jaconowski, the Russian  drum major.\"    \"Take the tibia. But it is a nuisance, there will not be a single  ornament left here.\"    During Marcel's absence, Rodolphe, his mind made up that that party  should be given in any case, went in search of his friend Colline, the  hyperphysical philosopher, who lived hard by.    \"I have come,\" said he, \"to ask you to do me a favor. As host I must  positively have a black swallow-tail, and I have not got one; lend me  yours.\"    \"But,\" said Colline hesitating, \"as a guest I shall want my black  swallow-tail too.\"    \"I will allow you to come in a frock coat.\"    \"That won't do. You know very well I have never had a frock coat.\"    \"Well, then, it can be settled in another way. If needs be, you need not  come to my party, and can lend me your swallow-tail.\"    \"That would be unpleasant. I am on the program, and must not be  lacking.\"    \"There are plenty of other things that will be lacking,\" said Rodolphe.  \"Lend me your black swallow-tail, and if you will come, come as you  like; in your shirt sleeves, you will pass for a faithful servant.\"    \"Oh no!\" said Colline, blushing. \"I will wear my great coat. But all the  same, it is very unpleasant.\" And as he saw Rodolphe had already seized  on the famous black swallow-tail, he called out to him, \"Stop a bit.  There are some odds and ends in the pockets.\"    Colline's swallow-tail deserves a word or two. In the first place it was  of a decided blue, and it was from habit that Colline spoke of it as \"my  black swallow-tail.\" And as he was the only one of the band owning a  dress coat, his friends were likewise in the habit of saying, when  speaking of the philosopher's official garment, \"Colline's black  swallow-tail.\" In addition to this, this famous garment had a special  cut, the oddest imaginable. The tails, very long, and attached to a very  short waist, had two pockets, positive gulfs, in which Colline was  accustomed to store some thirty of the volumes which he eternally  carried about with him. This caused his friends to remark that during  the time that the public libraries were closed, savants and literary men  could go and refer to the skirts of Colline's swallow-tail--a library  always open.    That day, extraordinary to relate, Colline's swallow-tail only contained  a quarto volume of Bayle, a treatise on the hyperphysical faculties in  three volumes, a volume of Condillac, two of Swedenborg and Pope's  \"Essay on Man.\" When he had cleared his bookcase-garment, he allowed  Rodolphe to clothe himself in it.    \"Hallo!\" said the latter, \"the left pocket still feels very heavy; you  have left something in it.\"    \"Ah!\" exclaimed Colline, \"that is so. I forgot to empty the foreign  languages pocket.\"    And he took out from this two Arabic grammars, a Malay dictionary, and a  stock breeder's manual in Chinese, his favorite reading.    When Rodolphe returned home he found Marcel playing pitch-and-toss with  three five franc pieces. At first Rodolphe refused his friend's  proferred hand--he thought some crime had been committed.    \"Let us make haste, let us make haste,\" said Marcel, \"we have the  fifteen francs required. This is how it happened. I met an antiquary at  Medicis'. When he saw the coin he was almost taken ill; it was the only  one wanting in his cabinet. He had sent everywhere to get this vacancy  filled up, and had lost all hope. Thus, when he had thoroughly examined  my Carlovingian crown piece, he did not hesitate for a moment to offer  me five francs for it. Medicis nudged me with his elbow; a look from  him completed the business. He meant, 'share the profits of the sale,  and I will bid against him.' We ran it up to thirty francs. I gave the  Jew fifteen, and here are the rest. Now our guests may come; we are in a  position to dazzle them. Hallo! You have got a swallow-tail!\"    \"Yes,\" said Rodolphe, \"Colline's swallow-tail.\" And as he was feeling  for his handkerchief, Rodolphe pulled out a small volume in a Tartar  dialect, overlooked in the foreign literature pocket.    The two friends at once proceeded to make their preparations. The studio  was set in order, a fire kindled in the stove, the stretcher of a  picture, garnished with composite candles, suspended from the ceiling  as a chandelier, and a writing table placed in the middle of the studio  to serve as a rostrum for the orators. The solitary armchair, which was  to be reserved for the influential critic, was placed in front of it,  and upon a table were arranged all the books, romances, poems,  pamphlets, &c., the authors of which were to honor the company with  their presence.    In order to avoid any collision between members of the different schools  of literature, the studio had been, moreover, divided into four  compartments, at the entrance to each of which could be read, on four  hurriedly manufactured placards, the inscriptions--\"Poets,\" \"Prose  Writers,\" \"Classic School,\" and \"Romantic School.\"    The ladies were to occupy a space reserved in the middle of the studio.    \"Humph! Chairs are lacking,\" said Rodolphe.    \"Oh!\" remarked Marcel, \"there are"]]]
