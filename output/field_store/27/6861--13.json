The princes of the Gazelle nome, for instance, bore the title  of \"Directors of the Prophets of all the Gods,\" but were, correctly  speaking, prophets of Horus, of Khnumu master of Haoirit, and of Pakhit  mistress of the Speos-Artemidos. The religious suzerainty of such  princes was the complement of their civil and military power, and their  ordinary income was augmented by some portion at least of the revenues  which the lands in mortmain furnished annually. The subordinate  sacerdotal functions were filled by professional priests whose status  varied according to the gods they served and the provinces in which they  were located. Although between the mere priest and the chief prophet  there were a number of grades to which the majority never attained,  still the temples attracted many people from divers sources, who, once  established in this calling of life, not only never left it, but never  rested until they had introduced into it the members of their families.  The offices they filled were not necessarily hereditary, but the  children, born and bred in the shelter of the sanctuary, almost always  succeeded to the positions of their fathers, and certain families thus  continuing in the same occupation for generations, at last came to be  established as a sort of sacerdotal nobility.*         * We possess the coffins of the priests of the Theban Montu       for nearly thirty generations, viz. from the XXVth dynasty       to the time of the Ptolemies. The inscriptions give us their       genealogies, as well as their intermarriages, and show us       that they belonged almost exclusively to two or three       important families who intermarried with one another or took       their wives from the families of the priests of Amon.    The sacrifices supplied them with daily meat and drink; the temple  buildings provided them with their lodging, and its revenues furnished  them with a salary proportionate to their position. They were exempted  from the ordinary taxes, from military service, and from forced labour;  it is not surprising, therefore, that those who were not actually  members of the priestly families strove to have at least a share in  their advantages. The servitors, the workmen and the _employes_ who  congregated about them and constituted the temple corporation, the  scribes attached to the administration of the domains, and to the  receipt of offerings, shared _de facto_ if not _de jure_ in the immunity  of the priesthood; as a body they formed a separate religious society,  side by side, but distinct from, the civil population, and freed from  most of the burdens which weighed so heavily on the latter.    The soldiers were far from possessing the wealth and influence of the  clergy. Military service in Egypt was not universally compulsory, but  rather the profession and privilege of a special class of whose  origin but little is known. Perhaps originally it comprised only the  descendants of the conquering race, but in historic times it was not  exclusively confined to the latter, and recruits were raised everywhere  among the fellahs,* the Bedouin of the neighbourhood, the negroes,**  the Nubians,*** and even from among the prisoners of war, or adventurers  from beyond the sea.****         * This is shown, _inter alia,_ by the real or supposititious       letters in which the master-scribe endeavours to deter his       pupil from adopting a military career, recommending that of       a scribe in preference.         ** Uni, under Papi I., recruited his army from among the       inhabitants of the whole of Egypt, from Elephantine to       Letopolis at the mouth of the Delta, and as far as the       Mediterranean, from among the Bedouin of Libya and of the       Isthmus, and even from the six negro races of Nubia       _(Inscription d'Ouni, 11. 14-19)_.         *** The Nubian tribe of the Mazaiu, afterwards known as the       Libyan tribe of the Mashauasha, furnished troops to the       Egyptian kings and princes for centuries; indeed, the Mazaiu       formed such an integral part of the Egyptian armies that       their name came to be used in Coptic as a synonym for       soldier, under the form \"matoi.\"         **** Later on we shall come across the Shardana of the Royal       Guard under Ramses II. (E. de Rouge, _Extrait d'un memoire       sur les attaques,_ p. 5); later still, the Ionians, Carians,       and Greek mercenaries will be found to play a decisive part       in the history of the Saite dynasties.    This motley collection of foreign mercenaries composed ordinarily the  body-guard of the king or of his barons, the permanent nucleus round  which in times of war the levies of native recruits were rallied. Every  Egyptian soldier received from the chief to whom he was attached, a  holding of land for the maintenance of himself and his family. In the  fifth century B.C. twelve _arurae_ of arable land was estimated as ample  pay for each man,* and tradition attributes to the fabulous Sesostris  the law which fixed the pay at this rate. The soldiers were not taxed,  and were exempt from forced labour during the time that they were away  from home on active service; with this exception they were liable to the  same charges as the rest of the population. Many among them possessed  no other income, and lived the precarious life of the fellah,--tilling,  reaping, drawing water, and pasturing their cattle,--in the interval  between two musters. Others possessed of private fortunes let their  holdings out at a moderate rental, which formed an addition to their  patrimonial income.**         * Herodotus, ii. 168. The arura being equal to 27.82 ares       [an are = 100 square metres], the military fief contained       27*82 x 12 = 333.84 ares. [The \"arura,\" according to F. L.       Griffith, was a square of 100 Egyptian cubits, making about       3/5 of an acre, or 2600 square metres.--Trs.] The _chifliks_       created by Mohammed-Ali, with a view to bringing the       abandoned districts into cultivation, allotted to each       labourer who offered to reclaim it, a plot of land varying       from one to three feddans, i.e. from 4200.83 square metres       to 12602.49 square metres, according to the nature of the       soil and the necessities of each family. The military fiefs       of ancient Egypt were, therefore, nearly three times as       great in extent as these _abadiyehs_, which were considered,       in modern Egypt, sufficient to supply the wants of a whole       family of peasants; they must, therefore, have secured not       merely a bare subsistence, but ample provision for their       proprietors.         ** Diodorus Siculus says in so many words (i. 74) that \"the       farmers spent their life in cultivating lands which had been       let to them at a moderate rent by the king, by the priests,       and _by the warriors_.\"    Lest they should forget the conditions upon which they possessed this  military holding, and should regard themselves as absolute masters  of it, they were seldom left long in possession of the same place:  Herodotus asserts that their allotments were taken away-yearly and  replaced by others of equal extent. It is difficult to say if this law  of perpetual change was always in force; at any rate, it did not prevent  the soldiers from forming themselves in time into a kind of aristocracy,  which even kings and barons of highest rank could not ignore. They were  enrolled in special registers, with the indication of the holding which  was temporarily assigned to them. A military scribe kept this register  in every royal nome or principality.    [Illustration: 092.jpg SOME OF THE MILITARY ATHLETIC EXERCISES]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a scene in the tomb of Amoni-       Amenemhait at Beni-Hasan.    He superintended the redistribution of the lands, the registration of  privileges, and in addition to his administrative functions, he had in  time of war the command of the troops furnished by his own district; in  which case he was assisted by a \"lieutenant,\" who as opportunity offered  acted as his substitute in the office or on the battle-field. Military  service was not hereditary, but its advantages, however trifling they  may appear to us, seemed in the eyes of the fellahs so great, that  for the most part those who were engaged in it had their children also  enrolled. While still young the latter were taken to the barracks, where  they were taught not only the use of the bow, the battle-axe, the mace,  the lance, and the shield, but were all instructed in such exercises as  rendered the body supple, and prepared them for manoeuvring, regimental  marching, running, jumping, and wrestling either with closed or open  hand. They prepared themselves for battle by a regular war-dance,  pirouetting, leaping, and brandishing their bows and quivers in the  air. Their training being finished, they were incorporated into local  companies, and invested with their privileges. When they were required  for service, part or the whole of the class was mustered; arms kept in  the arsenal were distributed among them, and they were conveyed in boats  to the scene of action. The Egyptians were not martial by temperament;  they became soldiers rather from interest than inclination.    The power of Pharaoh and his barons rested entirely upon these two  classes, the priests and the soldiers; the remainder, the commonalty and  the peasantry, were, in their hands, merely an inert mass, to be  taxed and subjected to forced labour at will. The slaves were probably  regarded as of little importance; the bulk of the people consisted of  free families who were at liberty to dispose of themselves and their  goods.

Its scribes  were accustomed to see their master treat the lords of other towns as  subjects or vassals. They fancied that this must have always been  the case, and that from its origin Babylon had been recognized as the  queen-city to which its contemporaries rendered homage. They made its  individual annals the framework for the history of the entire country,  and from the succession of its princely families on the throne, diverse  as they were in origin, they constructed a complete canon of the kings  of Chaldaea.    But the manner of grouping the names and of dividing the dynasties  varied according to the period in which the lists were drawn up, and at  the present time we are in possession of at least two systems which the  Babylonian historians attempted to construct. Berossus, who communicated  one of them to the Greeks about the beginning of the IInd century B.C.,  would not admit more than eight dynasties in the period of thirty-six  thousand years between the Deluge and the Persian invasion. The lists,  which he had copied from originals in the cuneiform character, have  suffered severely at the hands of his abbreviators, who omitted the  majority of the names which seemed to them very barbarous in form, while  those who copied these abbreviated lists have made such further havoc  with them that they are now for the most part unintelligible. Modern  criticism has frequently attempted to restore them, with varying  results; the reconstruction here given, which passes for the most  probable, is not equally certain in all its parts:--*    [Illustration: 084.jpg CHRONOLOGIC TABLE]    It was not without reason that Berossus and his authorities had put the  sum total of reigns at thirty-six thousand years; this number falls in  with a certain astrological period, during which the gods had granted to  the Chaldaeans glory, prosperity, and independence, and whose termination  coincided with the capture of Babylon by Cyrus.** Others before them had  employed the same artifice, but they reckoned ten dynasties in the place  of the eight accepted by Berossus:--         * After the example of G. B. Niebuhr, Gutschmid admitted       here, as Oppert did, 45 Assyrians; he based his view on       Herodotus, in which it is said that the Assyrians held sway       in Asia for 520 years, until its conquest by the Medes. Upon       the improbability of this opinion, see Schrader's       demonstration.         ** The existence of this astronomical or astrological scheme       on which Berossus founded his chronology, was pointed out by       Brandis, afterwards by Gutschmid; it is now generally       accepted.    [Illustration: 085.jpg TABLE]    Attempts have been made to bring the two lists* into harmony, with  varying results; in my opinion, a waste of time and labour. For even  comparatively recent periods of their history, the Chaldaeans, like  the Egyptians, had to depend upon a collection of certain abbreviated,  incoherent, and often contradictory documents, from which they found it  difficult to make a choice: they could not, therefore, always come to an  agreement when they wished to determine how many dynasties had succeeded  each other during these doubtful epochs, how many kings were included in  each dynasty, and what length of reign was to be assigned to each king.  We do not know the motives which influenced Berossus in his preference  of one tradition over others; perhaps he had no choice in the matter,  and that of which he constituted himself the interpreter was the only  one which was then known. In any case, the tradition he followed forms a  system which we cannot, modify without misinterpreting the intention of  those who drew it up or who have handed it down to us. We must accept  or reject it just as it is, in its entirety and without alteration:  to attempt to adapt it to the testimony of the monuments would be  equivalent to the creation of a new system, and not to the correction  simply of the old one. The right course is to put it aside for the  moment, and confine ourselves to the original lists whose fragments have  come down to us: they do not furnish us, it is true, with a history of  Chaldaea such as it unfolded itself from age to age, but they teach us  what the later Chaldaeans knew, or thought they knew, of that history.  Still it is wise to treat them with some reserve, and not to forget that  if they agree with each other in the main, they differ frequently in  details. Thus the small dynasties, which are called the VIth and VIIth,  include the same number of kings on both the tablets which establish  their existence, but the number of years assigned to the names of  the kings and the total years of each dynasty vary a little from one  another:--         * The first document having claim to the title of Royal       Canon was found among the tablets of the British Museum, and       was published by G. Smith. The others were successively       discovered by Pinches; some erroneous readings in them have       been corrected by Fr. Delitzsch, and an exact edition has       been published by Knudtzon. Smith's list is the fragment of       a chronicle in which the VIth, VIIth, and VIIIth dynasties       only are almost complete. One of Pinches's lists consists       merely of a number of royal names not arranged in any       consistent order, and containing their non-Semitic as well       as their Semitic forms. The other two lists are actual       canons, giving the names of the kings and the years of their       reigns; unfortunately they are much mutilated, and the       lacunae in them cannot yet be filled up. All of them have       been translated by Sayce.    [Illustration: 080.jpg TABLE]    [Illustration: 081.jpg TABLE]    Is the difference in the calculations the fault of the scribes, who,  in mechanically copying and recopying, ended by fatally altering the  figures? Or is it to be explained by some circumstance of which we are  ignorant--an association on the throne, of which the duration is at one  time neglected with regard to one of the co-regents, and at another time  with regard to the other; or was it owing to a question of legitimacy,  by which, according to the decision arrived at, a reign was prolonged or  abbreviated? Cotemporaneous monuments will some day, perhaps, enable  us to solve the problem which the later Chaldaeans did not succeed in  clearing up. While awaiting the means to restore a rigorously exact  chronology, we must be content with the approximate information  furnished by the tablets as to the succession of the Babylonian kings.    Actual history occupied but a small space in the lists--barely twenty  centuries out of a whole of three hundred and sixty: beyond the historic  period the imagination was given a free rein, and the few facts which  were known disappeared almost completely under the accumulation of  mythical narratives and popular stories. It was not that the documents  were entirely wanting, for the Chaldaeans took a great interest in their  past history, and made a diligent search for any memorials of it. Each  time they succeeded in disinterring an inscription from the ruins of a  town, they were accustomed to make-several copies of it, and to deposit  them among the archives, where they would be open to the examination  of their archaeologists.* When a prince undertook the rebuilding of  a temple, he always made excavations under the first courses of the  ancient structure in order to recover the documents which preserved the  memory of its foundation: if he discovered them, he recorded on the new  cylinders, in which he boasted of his own work, the name of the first  builder, and sometimes the number of years which had elapsed since its  erection.**         * We have a considerable number of examples of copies of       ancient texts made in this manner. For instance, the       dedication of a temple at Uruk by King Singashid, copied by       the scribe Nabubalatsuikbi, son of Mizirai (\"the Egyptian       \"), for the temple of Ezida; the legendary history of King       Sargon of Agade, copied from the inscription on the base of       his statue, of which there will be further mention (pp. 91-       93 of this History); a dedication of the King Khammurabi;       the inscription of Agumkakrimi, which came from the library       of Assurbanipal.         ** Nabonidos, for instance, the last king of Babylon before       the Persian conquest, has left us a memorial of his       excavations. He found in this manner the cylinders of       Shagashaltiburiash at Sippara, those of Khammurabi, and       those of Naramsin.    We act in a similar way to-day, and our excavations, like those of the  Chaldaeans, end in singularly disconnected results: the materials which  the earth yields for the reconstruction of the first centuries consist  almost entirely of mutilated records of local dynasties, isolated  names of sovereigns, dedications of temples to gods, on sites no longer  identifiable, of whose nature we know nothing, and too brief allusions  to conquests or victories over vaguely designated nations.* The  population was dense and life active in the plains of the Lower  Euphrates. The cities in this region formed at their origin so many  individual and, for the most part, petty states, whose kings and patron  gods claimed to be independent of all the neighbouring kings and gods:  one city, one god, one lord--this was the rule here as in the ancient  feudal districts from which the nomes of Egypt arose. The strongest  of these principalities imposed its laws upon the weakest: formed into  unions of two or three under a single ruler, they came to constitute a  dozen kingdoms of almost equal strength on the banks of the Euphrates.  On the north we are acquainted with those of Agade, Babylon, Kuta,  Kharsag-Kalama, and that of Kishu, which comprised a part of Mesopotamia  "]]]
