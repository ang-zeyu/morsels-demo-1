[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16679"],[0,"The History of England (#14)"],[1," is hard to dissociate the pope's feeling in this matter from his  rejection of the nomination of the king's chancellor, Ralph Neville,  Bishop of Chichester, to the see of Canterbury, as an illiterate  politician.    The dislike of the taxes made necessary by the Welsh and French wars,  such as the \"scutage of Poitou\" and the \"scutage of Kerry,\" swelled the  outcry against the justiciar. So far back as 1227 advantage had been  taken of Henry's majority to exact large sums of money for the  confirmation of all charters sealed during his nonage. The barons made  it a grievance that his brother Richard was ill-provided for, and a  rising in 1227 extorted a further provision for him from what was  regarded as the niggardliness of the justiciar. Nor did Hubert, with  all his rugged honesty, neglect his own interests. He secured for  himself lucrative wardships, such as the custody for the second time of  the great Gloucester earldom, and of several castles, including the not  very profitable charge of Montgomery, and the important governorship of  Dover. On the very eve of his downfall he was made justice of Ireland.  His brother was bishop of Ely, and other kinsmen were promoted to high  posts. He was satisfied that he spent all that he got in the King's  service, in promoting the interests of the kingdom, but his enemies  regarded him as unduly tenacious of wealth and office. All classes  alike grew disgusted with the justiciar. The restoration of the malign  influence of Peter of Winchester completed his ruin. The king greedily  listened to the complaints of his old guardian against the minister who  overshadowed the royal power. At last, on July 29, 1232, Henry plucked  up courage to dismiss him.    With Hubert's fall ends the second period of Henry's reign. William  Marshal expelled the armed foreigner. Hubert restored the  administration to English hands. Matthew Paris puts into the mouth of a  poor smith who refused to fasten fetters on the fallen minister words  which, though probably never spoken, describe with sufficient accuracy  Hubert's place in history: \"Is he not that most faithful Hubert who so  often saved England from the devastation of the foreigners and restored  England to England?\" Hubert was, as has been well said, perhaps the  first minister since the Conquest who made patriotism a principle of  policy, though it is easy in the light of later developments to read  into his doings more than he really intended. But whatever his motives,  the results of his action were clear. He drove away the mercenaries,  humbled the feudal lords, and set limits to the pope's interference. He  renewed respect for law and obedience to the law courts. Even in the  worst days of anarchy the administrative system did not break down, and  the records of royal orders and judicial judgments remain almost as  full in the midst of the civil war as in the more peaceful days of  Hubert's rule. But it was easy enough to issue proclamations and writs.  The difficulty was to get them obeyed, and the work of Hubert was to  ensure that the orders of king and ministers should really be respected  by his subjects. He made many mistakes. He must share the blame of the  failure of the Kerry campaign, and he was largely responsible for the  sorry collapse of the invasion of Poitou. He neither understood nor  sympathised with Stephen Langton's zeal for the charters. A  straightforward, limited, honourable man, he strove to carry out his  rather old-fashioned conception of duty in the teeth of a thousand  obstacles. He never had a free hand, and he never enjoyed the hearty  support of any one section of his countrymen. Hated by the barons whom  he kept away from power, he alienated the Londoners by his high-handed  violence, and the tax-payers by his heavy exactions. The pope disliked  him, the aliens plotted against him, and the king, for whom he  sacrificed so much, gave him but grudging support. But the reaction  which followed his retirement made many, who had rejoiced in his  humiliation, bitterly regret it.    Three notable enemies of Hubert went off the stage of history within a  few months of his fall. The death of Richard le Grand has already been  recorded. William Marshal, the brother-in-law of the king, the gallant  and successful soldier, the worthy successor of his great father, came  home from Brittany early in 1231. His last act was to marry his sister,  Isabella, to Richard of Cornwall. Within ten days of the wedding his  body was laid beside his father in the Temple Church at London. In  October, 1232, died Randolph of Blundeville, the last representative of  the male stock of the old line of the Earls of Chester, and long the  foremost champion of the feudal aristocracy against Hubert. The contest  between them had been fought with such chivalry that the last public act  of the old earl was to protect the fallen justiciar from the violence of  his foes. For more than fifty years Randolph had ruled like a king over  his palatine earldom; had, like his master, his struggles with his own  vassals, and had perforce to grant to his own barons and boroughs  liberties which he strove to wrest from his overlord for himself and his  fellow nobles. He was not a great statesman, and hardly even a  successful warrior. Yet his popular personal qualities, his energy, his  long duration of power, and his enormous possessions, give him a place  in history. His memory, living on long in the minds of the people,  inspired a series of ballads which vied in popularity with the cycle of  Robin Hood,[1] though, unfortunately, they have not come down to us. His  estates were divided among his four sisters. His nephew, John the Scot,  Earl of Huntingdon, received a re-grant of the Chester earldom; his  Lancashire lands had already gone to his brother-in-law, William of  Ferrars, Earl of Derby; other portions of his territories went to his  sister, the Countess of Arundel, and the Lincoln earldom, passing  through another sister, Hawise of Quincy, to her son-in-law, John of  Lacy, constable of Chester, raised the chief vassal of the palatinate to  comital rank. None of these heirs of a divided inheritance were true  successors to Randolph. With him died the last of the great Norman  houses, tenacious beyond its fellows, and surpassing in its two  centuries of unbroken male descent the usual duration of the medieval  baronial family. Its collapse made easier the alien invasion which  threatened to undo Hubert's work.        [1] \"Ich can rymes of Robyn Hode, and of Randolf erl of      Chestre,\" _Vision of Piers Plowman_, i., 167; ii., 94.          CHAPTER III.    THE ALIEN INVASION.      With the dismissal of Hubert on July 29, 1232, Peter des Roches resumed  his authority over Henry III. Mindful of past failures, the bishop's  aim was to rule through dependants, so that he could pull the wires  without making himself too prominent. His chief agents in pursuing this  policy were Peter of Rivaux, Stephen Segrave, and Robert Passelewe. Of  these, Peter of Rivaux was a Poitevin clerk, officially described as  the bishop's nephew, but generally supposed to have been his son.  Stephen Segrave, the son of a small Leicestershire landholder, was a  lawyer who had held many judicial and administrative posts, including  the regency during the king's absence abroad in 1230. He abandoned his  original clerical profession, received knighthood, married nobly, and  was the founder of a baronial house in the midlands. His only political  principle was obedience to the powers that were in the ascendant.  Passelewe, a clerk who had acted as the agent of Randolph of Chester  and Falkes of Breaute at the Roman court, was, like Segrave, a mere  tool.    The Bishop of Winchester began to show his hand. Between June 26 and  July 11, nineteen of the thirty-five sheriffdoms were bestowed on Peter  of Rivaux for life. As Segrave was sheriff of five shires, and the  bishop himself had acquired the shrievalty of Hampshire, this involved  the transference of the administration of over two-thirds of the  counties to the bishop's dependants. On the downfall of Hubert, Segrave  became justiciar. He was not the equal of his predecessors either in  personal weight or in social position, and did not aspire to act as  chief minister. The appointment of a mere lawyer to the great Norman  office of state marks the first stage in the decline, which before long  degraded the justiciarship into a simple position of headship over the  judges, the chief justiceship of the next generation. Hubert's offices  and lands were divided among his supplanters. Peter of Rivaux became  keeper of wards and escheats, castellan of many castles on the Welsh  march, and the recipient of even more offices and wardships in Ireland  than in England. The custody of the Gloucester earldom went to the  Bishop of Winchester. The last steps of the ministerial revolution were  completed at the king's Christmas court at Worcester. There Rivaux, who  had yielded up before Michaelmas most of his shrievalties, was made  treasurer, with Passelewe as his deputy. Of the old ministers only the  chancellor, Ralph Neville, Bishop of Chichester, was suffered to remain  in office. Finally the king's new advisers imported a large company of  Poitevin and Breton mercenaries, hoping with their help to maintain  their newly won position. The worst days of John seemed renewed.    The Poitevin gang called upon Hubert to render complete accounts for  the whole period of his justiciarship. When he pleaded that King John  had given him a charter of quittance, he was told that its force had  ended with the death of the grantor. He was further required to answer  for the wrongs which Twenge's bands had inflicted on the servants of  the pope. He was accused of poisoning William Earl of Salisbury,  William Marshal, Falkes de Breaute, and Archbishop Richard. He had  prevented the king from contracting a marriage with a daughter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16702"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol. 1, January 9, 1915 (#14)"],[1,"information.\"    Sir Edward Grey has attacked Germany for invading Belgium, but has  nowhere denied that Germany had the unimpeachable evidence she said she  had, and which of course nullified any previous assurance from France.    It is not known whether Sir Edward Grey was shown this evidence or not,  but if the preservation of Belgian neutrality was Great Britain's chief  concern, why did she not offer to negotiate treaties with Germany and  France as she had done in 1870? It will be remembered that then she  bound herself to join with either of the contestants in defending  Belgian neutrality against the attacks of the other.    As the case stands today, on the evidence of Sir Edward Grey's own  \"White Paper\" and speeches, Great Britain is making war on Germany  because:    1. She broke the Treaty of 1839, although her own Gladstone had declared  this treaty to be without force, and although the status of neutral  States had been removed by The Hague Convention from the uncertainty of  treaties to the security of international law.    2. Great Britain makes war against Germany because Germany has broken  Articles I. and II. of Chapter 1 of The Hague Convention referring to  neutrals, although Great Britain herself has refused to recognize these  articles as binding upon her own conduct.    3. She makes war on Germany although she has never denied the  correctness of Germany's assertion that she had unimpeachable proof of  France's intentions of going through Belgium, which, together with the  sojourn of French officers in Belgium, constitutes the offense which,  according to The Hague Convention, deprives a so-called neutral State of  the privileges granted in Articles I. and II.    It is impossible to say here exactly what these proofs are which Germany  possesses, and which for military reasons she has not yet been able to  divulge. She has published some of them, namely, the proof of the  continued presence of French officers on Belgian soil, and has given the  names and numbers of the several army corps which France had planned to  push through Belgium.    The case then stands as follows:    1. Was the inviolability of Belgium guaranteed by Articles I. and II. of  The Hague Convention? Yes.    2. Had Germany ratified these articles? Yes.    3. Had Great Britain ratified these articles? No.    4. Would Belgium have forfeited the right of having her country held  inviolable if she had committed \"acts in favor of France,\" even if these  acts were not actually hostile acts? Yes, according to Article XVII. of  The Hague Convention.    5. Did Belgium commit \"acts in favor of France,\" and was Germany,  therefore, justified in disregarding the inviolability of her territory?      The Main Question.    This is the important question, and the answer must be left to the  Supreme Court of Civilization. The weight of the evidence would seem to  point to a justification of Germany. Yet no friend of Germany can find  fault with those who would wish to defer a verdict until such a time  when Germany can present her complete proof to the world, and this may  be when the war is over.    Throughout this argument the famous passage of the Chancellor's speech  in the Reichstag has been disregarded. It reads:         Our troops have occupied Luxemburg and perhaps are already on       Belgian soil. Gentlemen, that is contrary to the dictates of       international law. It is true that the French Government has       declared at Brussels that France is willing to respect the       neutrality of Belgium so long as her opponents respect it. We       knew, however, that France stood ready for invasion. The       wrong--I speak openly--that we are committing we will endeavor       to make good.    This has been understood to mean that the Chancellor acknowledged that  Germany was breaking the Treaty of 1839 without warrant, and that  Germany, therefore, deserved the contempt of the world. May it not bear  another interpretation? Thus:    The Chancellor, like Gladstone in 1870, did not consider the 1839 Treaty  enforceable, but saw the guarantee for Belgium in The Hague Convention.  He did not wish to offend Belgium by announcing to the world that she  had lost her rights as a neutral because of her acts favorable to  France, for when he spoke he was still of the opinion that she would  accept the German offer which guaranteed to her both her independence  and integrity.    And just as Servia would have accepted Austria's note if Russia had  permitted her, so Belgium would not have resisted the German demand if  it had not been for England.    This can be proved by the British \"White Paper,\" Nos. 153 and 155. In  the former the King of the Belgians appeals \"to the diplomatic  intervention of your Majesty's Government to safeguard the integrity of  Belgium,\" being apparently of the impression that Germany wished to  annex parts, if not the whole, of his country. The London reply advises  the Belgians \"to resist by any means in their power, and that his  Majesty's Government will support them in offering such resistance, and  that his Majesty's Government in this event are prepared to join Russia  and France, if desired, in offering to the Belgian Government at once  common action for the purpose of resisting use of force by Germany  against them, and a guarantee to maintain their independence and  integrity in future years.\"    Has Mr. Beck really not noticed in this promise the omission of the word  neutrality? By the Treaty of 1839 Belgium enjoyed not only independence  and integrity, but also perpetual neutrality. Does Great Britain offer  to fight Germany for the enforcement of the Treaty of 1839? No! Because  hereafter the word neutrality is dropped from her guarantee, and since  she alone of all the great powers has not ratified the articles of The  Hague Convention concerning neutrals she alone will be able to disregard  the inviolability of Belgian soil, even though Belgium kept strictly  neutral in a future war.    And what, finally, does she guarantee her? Independence and integrity!  That is exactly the same that Germany had promised her. For this Belgium  had to be dragged through the horrors of war, and the good name of  Germany as that of an honest nation had to be dragged through the mire,  and hatred and murder had to be started, that Belgium might get on the  battlefield, from the insufficient support of Russia and France and  England, what Germany had freely offered her--independence and  integrity.    Casual readers would not miss the word neutrality from Sir Edward Grey's  guarantee, because they do not differentiate between the words  integrity, independence, and neutrality. Great Britain and her ally  Japan, marching through China into Kiao-Chau, may be said to have  violated China's neutrality, but not her independence, nor, so long as  they refrain from annexing any Chinese territory, her integrity.      Fixing the Blame.    Nobody familiar with the careful work of Sir Edward Grey can for one  moment believe that Sir Edward inadvertently dropped the word, just as  little as J. Ramsay Macdonald and other British leaders believe that he  inadvertently dropped one of the two remaining words, integrity and  independence, when he told Parliament of Germany's guarantee, and why  Great Britain should not accept it, but go to war.    When the blame for the horrors committed in Belgium are assessed these  facts must be remembered:    1. Belgium was by treaty bound to maintain fortresses.    2. France tempted her to commit \"acts friendly\" to herself, by which  Belgium forfeited her rights to the protection of The Hague articles  governing the rights and duties of neutrals.    3. England urged her to take up arms, when she had only asked to have  her integrity guaranteed by diplomatic intervention. (Nos. 153, 155.)    4. Germany promised her independence and integrity and peace, while  England, quietly dropping her guarantee of neutrality \"in future years,\"  promised her independence and integrity and war.    5. And Sir Edward Grey was able to sway Parliament, according to one of  the leaders of Parliament himself, only because he misrepresented  Germany's guarantee, and, having dropped, in his note to Belgium, the  word \"neutrality,\" dropped yet another of the two remaining words,  integrity and independence.    This is the case as it appears on the evidence contained in the various  \"White Papers.\" Austria was attending properly to her own affairs;  Servia was willing to yield; Russia, however, was determined to  humiliate Austria or to go to war. Germany proved a loyal friend to her  ally, Austria; she trusted in the British professions of friendship to  the last, and sacrificed seven valuable days in the interest of peace.  France was willing to do \"what might be required by her interests,\"  while Great Britain yielded to Russia and France, promising them their  support without which France, and therefore Russia, would not have  decided on war.    As to Belgium, Germany told Sir Edward Grey that she had unimpeachable  evidence that France was planning to go through Belgium, and she  published her evidence concerning the French officers who remained in  Belgium. Although Belgium had thus lost any rights attaching to her  state of neutrality, Germany promised to respect her integrity and  independence, and to pay for any damage done. She preferred, however, to  listen to Great Britain, who promised exactly the same except pay for  any damage done.    Unlike Mr. Beck, who in the same article pleads his case as the counsel  for the Allies and casts his verdict as the Supreme Court of  Civilization, the present writer prefers to leave the judgment to his  readers as a whole, and further still, to the whole American  people--yea, to all the peoples of the world. Nor is he in a hurry, for  he is willing to wait and have the Judges weigh the evidence and call  for more, if they consider insufficient what has"]]]
