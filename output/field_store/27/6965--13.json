There were also the Horses, fine strong creatures, always helping  somebody else and working all day during most of the year. They drew the  reaper through the tall grain, and where in the morning had been a field  of waving golden wheat, at sunset were bundles or sheaves of gathered  grain, and the stubble was ready for the fowls. They were busy people;  and sometimes during the winter they liked to remind their neighbors how  much they had done.    Then again, there were the Cows, who are the sisters of the Oxen. They  are large and there are many of them, yet they are not so wise, and that  is easily understood. All that they have to do on the farm is to give  milk for the butter-and cheese-making, and for the farmer's children to  drink. No farmer could get along without his Cows, but they do not work  like their brothers. They have so easy a time that they do not learn  much. You know, when people work, they have to think, and when people  think enough useful thoughts it makes them wise. That is one of the many  reasons why it is so foolish to be lazy.    Truly, it would be hard to say which farmyard family is the most  important, but there is no trouble at all in telling which family think  themselves the most so. If you ask any Goose, she will tell you that one  of their flock is worth five Horses or a dozen Cows. Nobody else would  tell you this, and if you should speak of it to the span of Bays, or the  Dappled Gray, or even the youngest Colt in the stable, they would answer  you only with a hearty Horse laugh. The Cows would smile and reply,  \"What a Goose she was to say that!\"    There has always been a flock of Geese on the farm, and their neighbors  are so used to their queer ways that they only smile when the Geese put  on airs, and it is a good-natured smile, too. They even feel rather  sorry for them when they lose their feathers, although the Nigh Ox once  said that if it were not for being plucked once in a while, the Geese  would really be too airy to live with.    Perhaps the Nigh Ox was right in what he said, for certainly after they  have worn their feathers all winter, they hold their heads higher than  ever, and tell what they think and what they would do, and it is well  they should be reminded that they work for a living like all their  neighbors. The farmer's wife never plucks the Geese until warm weather  comes. Then she takes all the soft, short feathers that they have worn  through the winter, and this leaves them looking very ragged indeed.  There was a time, years ago, when Geese had to give up their long  tail-and wing-feathers to be whittled into pens, but these Geese didn't  know about that, and there was nobody in the farmyard old enough to  remember it and tell them, so they thought they had a pretty hard time  in even giving up their breast feathers.    \"Sssss!\" the Gander used to say, \"if the farmer's boys must have  feather pillows on which to lay their heads, why do they not grow their  own feathers?\"    \"Humph!\" said the Nigh Ox once; \"If you must have oats to eat, why don't  you grow the oats?\" But the Gander was already waddling away and  pretended not to hear him.    It is in the winter that the Geese put on the most airs. Then, when the  Horses are being harnessed, they say to each other, \"Dear me! Wouldn't  it be dreadful to work in that way for a living?\" And sometimes, when  the team is hitched to a post by the farmhouse, they waddle past in a  single line with the Gander at the head, and say to the Horses: \"Hear  you have to take a load of wood to town. It's too bad. Hope you won't  get very tired. We are going to the river for a nice cold swim.  Good-bye.\" Then they march off with their heads held high, and as soon  as their backs are turned, the Horses look at each other and laugh  softly. They know that there is nothing in the world better than good,  honest, hard work, no matter of what kind it is.    Every winter the Geese forget about having to be plucked, and every  spring they are surprised to lose their feathers. They are plucked four  times before fall comes, and these four times come so near together that  even they can remember from one to another. You would think that then  they would not be so airy, but instead of saying, \"Of course we work for  our living--why shouldn't we?\" they say, \"Why, yes, we do let the  farmer's wife have some of our feathers when she wants them. We suppose  you might call it work to grow feathers for her, still it does not take  much of our time, and it is quite different from drawing loads and  getting tired as the Horses and Oxen do. Growing feathers is genteel.\"    They do not remember anything long, and so, when they have made a  mistake once, they are likely to make the same mistake over and over  again. Then, too, they cannot tell big things from little things, and  they are not happy unless they can have their own way all the time. And  you know that nobody can be sure of that. It all comes of their not  being willing to think hard, and sometimes it makes them a great deal of  trouble, as it did on the day when the Gray Goose would not go through  the farmyard gate.    This was soon after the Gander and his wife had hatched their brood of  seven Goslings, and they were taking them at once to the brook. It was  a happy day for all the flock. The Gander and the Mother Goose were glad  because their children were safely out of the shell, and because they  would no longer have to sit with cramped legs on the nest. Ganders are  good fathers, for they cover the eggs half of the time, while the Mother  Goose is resting. The other Geese were not only proud of the Goslings,  but they were glad to have the Gander and the Mother Goose free to go  around with them again. They had missed them very much.    The gate from the farmyard into the meadow stood wide open, and all the  Geese except the Gray one followed the Gander through. The Gray Goose  tried to go through a small hole in the fence very near the gate. She  squeezed her head into it and stretched her neck on the meadow side of  the fence, but she could not get any farther, although she pushed until  she was dizzy.    [Illustration: THE GRAY GOOSE TRIED TO GO THROUGH.]    \"Wait for me,\" she cried. \"Wait for me-ee!\"    \"Hurry, then,\" said the Gander.    \"I am hurrying,\" she cried, and she pushed with all her strength, but  since the hole in the fence was so small, she did not get any farther  than before.    \"Go through the gateway,\" said the Nigh Ox, who was grazing near by.    \"Sssss!\" said the Gray Goose stiffly. \"I would rather go through here. I  have chosen to go this way.\"    \"Oh!\" said the Nigh Ox, \"excuse me! Do go through there by all means!\"    \"We are going on,\" called the Gander; \"we would wait, but the Goslings  are in a hurry to take their first bath. Come as soon as you can.\"    The Gray Goose tried harder than ever to go the way that she had chosen,  but it only made her so out of breath that she had to lie down and rest.  Once she thought she heard somebody laugh, yet when she looked at the  Nigh Ox, who was the only person around, he was lying with closed eyes  and solemnly chewing his cud, so she decided that she must have been  mistaken.    Down by the brook the rest of the flock were cackling merrily, and she  could see the seven Goslings swimming with the Geese and the Gander.  \"Oh,\" she cried, \"how I wish I were with them! I don't see what is the  matter with this hole in the fence. The farmer ought to make it bigger.\"    She pushed and scolded and fussed until her neck was sore and she was  too tired to swim if she had a chance, so she sat down to rest. She did  remember what the Nigh Ox had said; still, if she couldn't go as she had  planned, she wouldn't go at all. She walked into the barn to find a cool  and shady place, lowering her head as she stepped over the threshold of  the high front door.    \"What did you do that for?\" twittered a Swallow.    \"Because I don't want to hit my head on the top of the doorway;\" she  replied. \"I always do so. All of our flock do so.\"    \"Tittle-ittle-ittle-ee,\" laughed the Swallow, as she darted away and  alighted on the fence by the Nigh Ox. \"Why isn't the Gray Goose in  swimming with the rest?\" asked she.    \"Because she can't push her fat body through that hole in the fence,\"  said the Nigh Ox, switching his tail toward it as he spoke.    \"Why doesn't she go through the gateway, then?\" asked the Swallow.    \"Because she says she would rather go the other way, and that if she  can't go that way, she won't go at all.\"    \"And she is missing all that fun?\" said the Swallow.    \"All of it,\" answered the Nigh Ox, \"but then, you know, she is such a  Goose!\"          WHY THE SHEEP RAN AWAY      It was during the hottest summer weather that the wind-storm came. The  farmyard people always spoke of it as \"the\" wind-storm, because not even  the Blind Horse, who had lived on the farm longer than any of his  neighbors, could remember anything like it. \"I recall one time,\" he  said, \"when a sweet-apple tree was blown down in the fall. The Hogs  found it and ate all the fruit before the farmer knew that it was down.  You should have heard them grunt over it. They were afraid the farmer  would drive them away before they had eaten it all. Eh, well! They ate  all they wanted, but one of the Pigs told me afterward that it made them  sick, and that he never wanted to see another sweet apple as long as he  lived. That was a hard storm, but not like this, not like this.\"    It had come in the night when the farmyard people were asleep, and there  was much scampering to shelter. The fowls, who were roosting in the old  apple-tree, did not have time to oil their feathers and make them  water-proof. They just flew off their perches as fast as they could and  ran for the open door of the Hen-house. When they were once inside, they  ruffled up their feathers and"]]]
