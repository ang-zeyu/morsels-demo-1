Every       Egyptian peasant, however, possessed his own, and it was in       constant use in his daily life.    In fact, it did duty as a cloak, sheltering the wearer from the sun  or from the rain, from the heat or from the cold. They never sought to  transform it into a luxurious garment of state, as was the case in later  times with the Roman toga, whose amplitude secured a certain dignity of  carriage, and whose folds, carefully adjusted beforehand, fell around  the body with studied grace. The Egyptian mantle when not required was  thrown aside and folded up. The material being fine and soft it occupied  but a small space and was reduced to a long thin roll; the ends being  then fastened together, it was slung over the shoulder and round the  body like a cavalry cloak.[*]         * Many draughtsmen, ignorant of what they had to represent,       have made incorrect copies of the manner in which this cloak       was worn; but examples of it are numerous, although until       now attention has not been called to them. The following are       a few instances taken at random of the way in which it was       used: Pepi I., fighting against the nomads of Sinai, has the       cloak, but with the two ends passed through the belt of his       loin-cloth; at Zawyet el-Maiyitin, Khunas, killing birds       with the boomerang from his boat, wears it, but simply       thrown over the left shoulder, with the two extremities       hanging free. Khnumhotpu at Beni-Hasan, the Khrihdbi, the       overseers, or the peasants, all have it rolled and slung       round them; the Prince of el-Bersheh wears it like a mantle       in folds over the two shoulders. If it is objected that the       material could not be reduced to such small dimensions as       those represented in these drawings of what I believe to be       the Egyptian cloak, I way cite our cavalry capes, when       rolled and slung, as an instance of what good packing will       do in reducing volume.    [Illustration: 070.jpg a dignitary wrapped in his large cloak. 1]         1 Statue of Khiti in the Gizeh Museum (XIIth and XIIIth       dynasties), drawn by Faucher-Gudin.    Travellers, shepherds, all those whose occupations called them to the  fields, carried it as a bundle at the ends of their sticks; once arrived  at the scene of their work, they deposited it in a corner with their  provisions until they required it. The women were at first contented  with a loin-cloth like that of the men; it was enlarged and lengthened  till it reached the ankle below and the bosom above, and became a  tightly fitting garment, with two bands over the shoulders, like braces,  to keep it in place. The feet were not always covered; on certain  occasions, however, sandals of coarse leather, plaited straw, split  reed, or even painted wood, adorned those shapely Egyptian feet, which,  to suit our taste, should be a little shorter.    [Illustration: 072.jpg COSTUME OF EGYPTIAN WOMAN, SPINNING. 1]         1  Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the spinning-women at       the Paris Exhibition of 1889. It was restored from the       paintings in the tomb of Khnumhotpu at Beni-Hasan.    Both men and women loved ornaments, and covered their necks, breasts,  arms, wrists, and ankles with many rows of necklaces and bracelets. The  bracelets were made of elephant ivory, mother-of-pearl, or even flint,  very cleverly perforated. The necklaces were composed of strings of  pierced shells,[**] interspersed with seeds and little pebbles,  either sparkling or of unusual shapes.[***] Subsequently imitations  in terra-cotta replaced the natural shells, and precious stones were  substituted for pebbles, as were also beads of enamel, either round,  pear-shaped, or cylindrical: the necklaces were terminated and a uniform  distance maintained between the rows of beads, by several slips of wood,  bone, ivory, porcelain, or terra-cotta, pierced with holes, through  which ran the threads.         **  The burying-places of Abydos, especially the most       ancient, have furnished us with millions of shells, pierced       and threaded as necklaces; they all belong to the species of       cowries used as money in Africa at the present day.         ***  Necklaces of seeds have been found in the tombs of       Abydos, Thebes, and Gebelen.    Of  these  Schweinfurth       has  identified,   among others,   the _Cassia absus_,  \"a       weed of the Soudan whose seeds are sold in the drug bazaar       at Cairo and Alexandria under the name of _shishn_, as a       remedy, which is in great request among the natives, for       ophthalmia.\" For the necklaces of pebbles, cf. Maspeeo,       Guide du visiteur, pp. 270, 271, No. 4129. A considerable       number of these pebbles, particularly those of strange       shape, or presenting a curious combination of colours, must       have been regarded as amulets or fetishes by their Egyptian       owners; analogous cases, among other peoples, have been       pointed out by E. B. Tylor, Primitive Culture, vol. ii. p.       189.    [Illustration: 073.jpg MAN WEARING WIG AND NECKLACES.1]         1 Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a portrait of Pharaoh Seti I.       of the XIXth dynasty: the lower part of the necklace has       been completed.    Weapons, at least among the nobility, were an indispensable part of  costume. Most of them were for hand-to-hand fighting: sticks, clubs,  lances furnished with a sharpened bone or stone point, axes and daggers  of flint,[*] sabres and clubs of bone or wood variously shaped, pointed  or rounded at the end, with blunt or sharp blades,--inoffensive enough  to look at, but, wielded by a vigorous hand, sufficient to break an arm,  crush in the ribs, or smash a skull with all desirable precision.[**]  The plain or triple curved bow was the favourite weapon for attack at  a distance,[***] but in addition to this there were the sling, the  javelin, and a missile almost forgotten nowadays, the boomerang, we have  no proof however, that the Egyptians handled the boomerang[****] with  the skill of the Australians, or that they knew how to throw it so as to  bring it back to its point of departure.[v]         *  In several museums, notably at Leyden, we find Egyptian       axes of stone, particularly of serpentine, both rough and       polished.         **  In primitive times the bone of an animal served as a       club.    This is proved by the shape of the object held in       the hand in the sign and the hieroglyph which is the       determinative in writing for all ideas   of violence or       brute force, comes down to us from a time when the principal       weapon was the club, or a bone serving as a club.         ***  For the two principal shapes of the bow, see Lepsius,       Der Bogen in der Hieroglypliik (Zeitschrift, 1872, pp. 79-       88). From the earliest times the sign mL portrays the       soldier equipped with the bow and bundle of arrows; the       quiver was of Asiatic origin, and was not adopted until much       later. In the contemporary texts of the first dynasties, the       idea of weapons is conveyed by the bow, arrow, and club or       axe.         ****  The boomerang is still used by certain tribes of the       Nile valley.    It is portrayed in the most ancient tombs,       and every museum possesses examples, varying in shape.       Besides the ordinary boomerang, the Egyptians used one which       ended in a knob, and another of semicircular shape: this       latter, reproduced in miniature in cornelian or in red       jasper, served as an amulet, and was placed on the mummy to       furnish the deceased in the other world with a fighting or       hunting weapon.         v  The Australian boomerang is much larger than the Egyptian       one; it is about a yard in length, two inches in width, and       three sixteenths of an inch in thickness. For the manner of       handling it, and what can be done with it, see Lubbock,       Prehistoric Man, pp. 402, 403.

Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-       Bey.    Such was approximately the most ancient equipment as far as we can  ascertain; but at a very early date copper and iron were known in  Egypt.[**] Long before historic times, the majority of the weapons in  wood were replaced by those of metal,--daggers, sabres, hatchets, which  preserved, however, the shape of the old wooden instruments.         **  Metals were introduced into Egypt in very ancient times,       since the class of blacksmiths is associated with the       worship of Horus of Edfu, and appears in the account of the       mythical wars of that God. The earliest tools we possess, in       copper or bronze, date from the IVth dynasty: pieces of iron       have been found from time to time in the masonry of the       Great Pyramid. Mons Montelius has again and again contested       the authenticity of these discoveries, and he thinks that       iron was not known in Egypt till a much later period.    Those wooden weapons which were retained, were used for hunting, or were  only brought out on solemn occasions when tradition had to be respected.

The following is a translation of  Leibnitz' letter, the original of which I saw in the library:    \"Dionysius Papin, Councillor and Physician to his royal highness the  Elector of Cassel, also Professor of Mathematics at Marburg, is about  to dispatch a vessel of singular construction down the river Weser to  Bremen. As he learns that all ships coming from Cassel, or any point  on the Fulda, are not permitted to enter the Weser, but are required  to unload at Muenden, and as he anticipates some difficulty, although  those vessels have a different object, his own not being intended for  freight, he begs most humbly that a gracious order be granted that his  ship may be allowed to pass unmolested through the electoral domain,  which petition I most humbly support.      G.W. LEIBNITZ.    \"Hanover, July 13, 1707.\"    This letter was returned to Leibnitz with the following indorsement:  \"The Electoral Councillors have found serious obstacles in the way of  granting the above petition, and, without giving their reasons, have  directed me to inform you of their decision, and that in consequence  the request is not granted by his Electoral Highness.      H. REICHE.    \"Hanover, July 25, 1707.\"    This failure of Papin's petition was the deathblow to his effort to  establish steam navigation. A mob of boatmen, who thought they saw in  the embryo ship the ruin of their business, attacked the vessel at  night and utterly destroyed it. Papin narrowly escaped with his life,  and fled to England, where he endured great hardships and poverty, and  all traces of him were soon lost, so that it is uncertain in what  country he finally died or where he was buried.    This remarkable man was driven out of France on account of his  Protestant faith, and found a refuge in Germany; here he was again  persecuted on account of the injury that ignorant and jealous people  believed his inventions would inflict upon the industries of the  country; and when the climax of steam engines for pumping water and  propelling ships was reached, the enlightened government of the period  \"found serious obstacles\" in the way of granting him protection, and,  without condescending to state what those \"objections\" were, secretly  instigated the mob to make an end of the trouble. It is another  instance, unfortunately too often repeated in history, of the mischief  men dressed up in a little brief authority can work upon their  generation. If Papin had been permitted to navigate the Weser with his  ship, and to carry it to London, as was his intention, it is possible  that we should have had steamboats one hundred years earlier than they  were given to us by Fulton. The plan proposed by Papin was highly  impracticable; but a knowledge of what Savery had done in the way of  steam machinery, aided by the shrewd suggestions of Leibnitz, combined  with the practical assistance of Englishmen, would, no doubt, have  enabled him to improve upon his invention until it had obtained  sufficient credit to be secure against the misfortune of being  totally forgotten. After the lapse of 100 years from the date of  Papin's invention, when the first steamboat was put upon the river  Rhine, the vessel was fired into by concealed marksmen on shore, and  navigation was more dangerous than it is now on the upper waters of  the Missouri in times of Indian hostility. It was only after  stationing troops along the banks of the river to protect the boatmen  that the government, fortunately more enlightened than in the days of  Leibnitz, was able to establish steam navigation on a secure footing.    I have thought it worth while to make this contribution to the history  of steam navigation, particularly as I have been able to authenticate  a portion of it by reference to original documents.    Columbia College, New York city, January, 1877.           *       *       *       *       *          THE SPEAKING TELEGRAPH.      We have heretofore given accounts of the wonderful success of  Professor Bell in transmitting the vibrations of the human voice by  electrical means over a telegraph wire. He has lately made  improvements in his method of transmission, by which he dispenses with  the use of the battery, and substitutes the magneto-electric plan of  producing the current. The Boston _Transcript_ describes a recent  experiment with the new apparatus, by which conversation and singing  was successfully carried on between Boston and Malden, a distance of  six miles. The telephone, in its present form, consists of a powerful  compound permanent magnet, to the poles of which are attached ordinary  telegraph coils of insulated wire. In front of the poles, surrounded  by these coils of wire, is placed a diaphragm of iron. A mouthpiece to  converge the sound upon this diaphragm substantially completes the  arrangement. As is well known, the motion of steel or iron in front of  the poles of a magnet creates a current of electricity in coils  surrounding the poles of the magnet, and the duration of this current  of electricity coincides with the duration of the motion of the steel  or iron moved or vibrated in the proximity of the magnet. When the  human voice causes the diaphragm to vibrate, electrical undulations  are induced in the coils environing the magnets, precisely analogous  to the undulations of the air produced by that voice. These coils are  connected with the line wire, which may be of any length, provided the  insulation be good. The undulations which are induced in these coils  travel through the line wire, and, passing through the coils of an  instrument of precisely similar construction at the distant station,  are again resolved into air undulations by the diaphragm of this  instrument.    The experiments were as follows: Telephones having been connected with  the private telegraphic line of the Boston Rubber Shoe Company,  conversation was at once commenced. Stationed at the Boston end of the  wire, Professor Bell requested Mr. Watson, who was at the Malden end,  to speak in loud tones, with a view of enabling the entire company at  once to distinguish the sounds.    This was so successful that a smile of mingled pleasure and surprise  played on the features of those present. That it, however, might not  be supposed that loud speaking was essential to intelligibility, Mr.  Bell explained that soft tones could be heard across the wires even  more distinctly than loud utterances, even a whisper being audible. In  confirmation of this statement, Mr. Watson commenced speaking in turn  with each member of the company; and after the efficiency of this  method had been proved to the satisfaction of all, he took up a  newspaper and informed the assemblage that gold had closed the  previous evening at New York at 105-5/8. As there were quite a number  of business men present, the effect that this practical demonstration  of the value of the telephone produced can scarcely be exaggerated.  Other passages from the daily journals were then given, and by this  time the desire for conversation having become general, Mr. Watson was  plied with questions such as: \"Is it thawing or freezing at Malden?  Who will be the next President?\" etc. It was remarkable that Mr.  Watson was able to distinguish between the voices at the Boston end,  he calling at least one gentleman by name as soon as the latter  commenced speaking.    This went on for some time, until a lady at the Malden end sent the  company an invitation to lunch per telephone, and an appropriate  response was made by the same medium. At length the Boston company  were requested to remain quiet while a lady at the other end conveyed  to them the sweet strains of music. The assemblage thereupon listened  with rapt attention while a young lady commenced singing \"The Last  Rose of Summer.\" The effect was simply charming. The sound of the  voice penetrated into the Boston end of the telephone with a  distinctness equal to that attainable in the more distant parts of a  large concert room, and a unanimous vote of thanks was sent by the  handy little instrument which had procured for the assemblage so  agreeable an hour.           *       *       *       *       *      The superb steam engine built by C.H. Brown & Co., of Fitchburg,  Mass., which was illustrated and described on page 1 of our current  volume, has been purchased by Messrs. Phineas Jones & Co., and is  being erected in their extensive carriage wheel works at Newark, N.J.           *       *       *       *       *          CROSSING A RIVER ON A WIRE.      A reporter of the New York Sun wanted to realize the sensation of  being suspended on a wire 275 feet from the surface of the earth. He  applied to the engineer of the Brooklyn bridge for permission to cross  the East river on a wire, three quarters of an inch in diameter, which  hangs between the two towers. He was refused permission; but he  finally saw the president of the company, who granted his request.  Arriving at the appointed time, the engineer, Mr. Farrington, said:  \"Well, sir; whenever you're ready, I am.\"    \"All ready, said I, as bold as brass outside, and as nervous as the  Endorian witch on the inside. He walked on and I followed, when,  Horror of Horrors--capital H's--to both Horrors--instead of leading me  to the 'cradle,' which I called a raft, he took me to a little square  board held up by two crossed iron arms, called a 'buggy.' It was about  three feet square, and depended from the 'traveler,' a three quarter  inch wire which crosses the river, and is run from tower to tower over  apparatus, by means of a stationary engine.
