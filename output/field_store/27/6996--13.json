How can it be that a good distributed makes more  possessors richer with itself, than if by few it is  possessed?\"[6] And he to me, \"Because thou fastenest thy mind  only on earthly things, from true light thou gatherest darkness.  That infinite and ineffable Good which is on high, runs to love  even as the sunbeam comes to a lucid body. As much of itself it  gives as it finds of ardor; so that how far soever charity  extends, beyond it doth the eternal bounty increase. And the more  the people who are intent on high the more there are for loving  well, and the more love is there, and like a mirror one reflects  to the other. And if my discourse appease not thy hunger, thou  shalt see Beatrice, and she will fully take from thee this and  every other longing. Strive only that soon may be extinct, as two  already are, the five wounds that are closed up by being  painful.\"[7]    [1] \"Blessed are the merciful.\"    [2] At the passage from each round, the Angel at the foot of the  stairs repeats words from the Beatitudes adapted to those  purified from the sin punished upon the ledge which is being  left.    [3] In the last canto, Guido del Duca had exclaimed, \"O human  race, why dost thou set thy heart there where companionship must  needs be excluded!\"    [4] The Empyrean.    [5] \"Since good, the more  Communicated, the more abundant grows.\"  Milton, Paradise Lost, v. 73.    [6] \"True love in this differs from gold and clay,      That to divide is not to take away.\"--Shelley, Epipsychidion.    [7] The pain of contrition.      As I was about to say \"Thou satisfiest me,\" I saw myself arrived  on the next round,[1] so that my eager eyes made me silent. There  it seemed to me I was of a sudden rapt in an ecstatic vision, and  saw many persons in a temple, and a lady at the entrance, with  the sweet action of a mother, saying, \"My son, why hast thou done  thus toward us? Lo, sorrowing, thy father and I were seeking  thee;\" and when here she was silent, that which first appeared,  disappeared.    [1] Where the sin of anger is expiated.      Then appeared to me another, with those waters down along her  cheeks which grief distils when it springs from great despite  toward others, and she was saying, \"If thou art lord of the city  about whose name was such great strife among the gods, and whence  every science sparkles forth, avenge thyself on those audacious  arms, that have embraced our daughter, O Pisistratus.\" And the  lord appeared to me, benign and mild, to answer her, with  temperate look, \"What shall we do to him who desires ill for us,  if he who loves us is by us condemned?\"[1]    [1] Dante translated this story from Valerius Maximus, Facta et  dicta mem., vi. 1.      Then I saw people kindled with fire of wrath, killing a youth  with stones, loudly crying to each other only, \"Slay, slay.\" And  I saw him bowed by death, which now was weighing on him, toward  the ground, but in such great strife he ever made of his eyes  gates for heaven, praying to the high Lord, that He would pardon  his persecutors, with that aspect which unlocks pity.[1]    [1] See Acts, vii. 55-60.      When my mind returned outwardly to the things which outside of it  are true, I recognized my not false errors. My Leader, who could  see me do like a man who looses himself from slumber, said,  \"What ails thee, that thou canst not support thyself? but art  come more than a half league veiling thine eyes, and with thy  legs staggering like one whom wine or slumber bends.\" \"O sweet  Father mine, if thou harkenest to me I will tell thee,\" said I,  \"what appeared to me when my legs were thus taken from me.\" And  he, \"If thou hadst a hundred masks upon thy face, thy thoughts  howsoever small would not be hidden from me. That which thou hast  seen was in order that thou excuse not thyself from opening thy  heart to the waters of peace which are poured forth from the  eternal fountain. I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' for the reason  that he does who looks only with the eye which hath no seeing  when the body lies inanimate; but I asked, in order to give vigor  to the foot; thus it behoves to spur the sluggards, slow to use  their wakefulness when it returns.\"    We were going on through the vesper time, forward intent so far  as the eyes could reach against the bright evening rays; when,  lo, little by little, a smoke came toward us, dark as night; iior  was there place to shelter ourselves from it. This took from us  our eyes and the pure air.        CANTO XVI. Third Ledge the Wrathful.--Marco Lombardo.--His  discourse on Free Will, and the Corruption of the World.      Gloom of hell, or of night deprived of every planet, under a  barren sky, obscured by clouds as much as it can be, never made  so thick a veil to my sight nor to my feeling so harsh of tissue  as that smoke which covered us there; so that my eye endured not  to stay open[1] wherefore my sage and trusty Escort drew to my  side and offered me his shoulder. Even as a blind man goes behind  his guide, in order not to stray, and not to butt against  anything that may hurt or perhaps kill him, I went along, through  the bitter and foul air, listening to my Leader, who was ever  saying, \"Take care that thou be not cut off from me.\"    [1] The gloom and the smoke symbolize the effects of anger on the  soul.      I heard voices, and each appeared to be praying for peace and  mercy to the Lamb of God that taketh sins away. Only \"Agnus  Dei[1] were their exordiums: one word there was in all, and one  measure; so that among them seemed entire concord. \"Are these  spirits, Master, that I hear?\" said I. And he to me, \"Thou  apprehendest truly; and they go loosening the knot of anger.\"  \"Now who art thou that cleavest our smoke, and yet dost speak of  us even as if thou didst still divide the time by calends?\" [2]  Thus by one voice was said: whereon my Master said, \"Reply, and  ask if by this way one goeth up.\" And I, \"O creature, that  cleansest thyself in order to return beautiful unto Him who made  thee, a marvel shalt thou hear if thou accompanyest me.\" \"I will  follow thee, so far as is permitted me,\" it replied, \"and if the  smoke allows not seeing, in its stead hearing shall keep us  joined.\" Then I began, \"With that swathing band which death  unbinds I go upward, and I came hither through the infernal  anguish. And if God bath so enclosed me in His grace that He  wills that I should see His court by a mode wholly out of modern  usage, conceal not from me who thou wert before thy death, but  tell it to me, and tell me if I am going rightly to the pass; and  let thy words be our guides.\" \"Lombard I was, and was called  Marco; the world I knew, and that worth I loved, toward which  every one hath now unbent his bow. For mounting thou art going  rightly.\" Thus he replied, and added, \"I pray thee that thou pray  for me when thou shalt he above.\" And I to him, \"I pledge my  faith to thee to do that which thou askest of me; but I am  bursting inwardly with a doubt, if I free not myself of it; at  first it was simple, and now it is made double by thy words which  make certain to me, here as elsewhere, that wherewith I couple  it.[3] The world is indeed as utterly deserted by every virtue as  thou declarest to me, and with iniquity is big and covered; but I  pray that thou point out to me the cause, so that I may see it,  and that I may show it to others; for one sets it in the heavens,  and one here below.\"    [1] \"The Lamb of God.\"    [2] By those in the eternal world dine is not reckoned by earth  divisions.    [3] The doubt was occasioned by Guido del Duca's words (Canto  XV.), in regard to the prevalence of evil in Tuscany, arising  either from misfortune of the place, or through the bad habits of  men. The fact of the iniquity of men was now reaffirmed by Marco  Lombardo; Dante accepts the fact as certain, and his doubt is  coupled with it.      A deep sigh that grief wrung into \"Ay me!\" he first sent forth,  and then began, \"Brother, the world is blind, and thou forsooth  comest from it. Ye who are living refer every cause upward to the  heavens only, as if they of necessity moved all things with  themselves. If this were so, free will would be destroyed in you,  and there would be no justice in having joy for good, and grief  for evil. The heavens initiate your movements: I do not say all  of them; but, supposing that I said it, light for good and for  evil is given to you; and free will, which, if it endure fatigue  in the first battles with the heavens, afterwards, if it be well  nurtured, conquers everything. To a greater force, and to a  better nature, ye, free, are subjected, and that creates the mind  in you, which the heavens have not in their charge.' Therefore if  the present world goes astray, in you is the cause, in you let it  be sought; and of this I will now be a true informant for thee.    [1] The soul of man is the direct creation of God, and is in  immediate subjection to His power; it is not in charge of the  Heavens, and its will is free to resist their mingled and  imperfect influences.      \"Forth from the hand of Him who delights in it ere it exist, like  to a little maid who, weeping and smiling, wantons childishly,  issues the simple little soul, which knows nothing, save that,  proceeding from a glad Maker, it willingly turns to that which  allures it. Of trivial good at first it tastes the savor; by this  it is deceived and runs after it, if guide or bridle bend not its  love. Wherefore it was needful to impose law as a bridle; needful  to have a king who could discern at least the tower of the true  city. The laws exist, but who set hand to them? Not one: because  the shepherd who is in advance can ruminate, but has not his  hoofs divided?[1] Wherefore the people, who see their guide only  at that good[2] whereof they are greedy, feed upon that, and seek  no further. Well canst"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#14)"],[1," kindled nothing is lost, and it lasts short  while, so, from the arm which extends on the right, to the foot  of that Cross, ran a star of the constellation which is  resplendent there. Nor from its ribbon did the gem depart, but  through the radial strip it ran along and seemed like fire behind  alabaster. Thus did the pious shade of Anchises advance (if our  greatest Muse merits belief), when in Elysium he perceived. his  son.[1]    [1] \"And he (Anchises), when he saw Aeneas advancing to meet him  over the grass, stretched forth both hands eagerly, and the tears  poured down his cheeks, and he cried out, 'Art thou come at  length?\"--Aeneid, vi. 684-7.      \"O sanguis meus! o superinfusa gratia Dei! sicut tibi, cui bis  unquam coeli janua reclusa?\"[1] Thus that light; whereat I gave  heed to it; then I turned my sight to my Lady, and on this side  and that I was wonderstruck; for within her eyes was glowing such  a smile, that with my own I thought to touch the depth of my  grace and of my Paradise.    [1] \"O blood of mine! O grace of God poured from above! To whom,  as to thee, was ever the gate of Heaven twice opened?\"    Then, gladsome to hear and to see, the spirit joined to his  beginning things which I understood not, he spoke so profoundly.  Nor did he hide himself to me by choice, but by necessity, for  his conception was set above the mark of mortals. And when the  bow of his ardent affection was so relaxed that his speech  descended towards the mark of our understanding, the first thing  that was understood by me was, \"Blessed be Thou, Trinal, and One  who in my offspring art so courteous.\" And he went on, \"Grateful  and long hunger, derived from reading in the great vouime where  white or dark is never changed,[1] thou hast relieved, my son,  within this light in which I speak to thee, thanks to Her who  clothed thee with plumes for the lofty flight. Thou believest  that thy thought flows to me from that which is first; even as  from the unit, if that be known, ray out the five and six. And  therefore who I am, and why I appear to thee more joyous than any  other in this glad crowd, thou askest me not. Thou believest the  truth; for the less and the great of this life gaze upon the  mirror in which, before thou thinkest, thou dost display thy  thought. But in order that the sacred Love, in which I watch with  perpetual sight, and which makes me thirst with sweet desire, may  be fulfilled the better, let thy voice, secure, bold, and glad,  utter the wish, utter the desire, to which my answer is already  decreed.\"    [1] In the mind of God, in which there is no change.      I turned me to Beatrice, and she heard before I spoke, and smiled  to me a sign which made the wings to my desire grow: and I began  thus: \"When the first Equality appeared to you, the affection  and the intelligence became of one weight for each of you;  because the Sun which illumined and warmed you is of such  equality in its heat and in its light that all similitudes are  defective. But will and discourse in mortals, for the reason  which is manifest to you, are diversely feathered in their  wings.[1] Wherefore I, who am mortal, feel myself in this  inequality,[2] and therefore I give not thanks, save with my  heart, for thy paternal welcome. Truly I beseech thee, living  topaz that dost ingem this precious jewel, that thou make me  content with thy name?\" \"O leaf of mine, in whom, while only  awaiting, I took pleasure, I was thy root.\" Such a beginning he,  answering, made to me. Then he said to me: \"He from whom thy  family is named,[3] and who for a hundred years and more has  circled the mountain on the first ledge, was my son and was thy  great-grandsire. Truly it behoves that thou shorten for him his  long fatigue with thy works. Florence, within the ancient circle  wherefrom she still takes both tierce and nones,[4] was abiding  in sober and modest peace. She had not necklace nor coronal, nor  dames with ornamented shoes, nor girdle which was more to be  looked at than the person. Not yet did the daughter at her birth  cause fear to the father, for the time and dowry did not evade  measure on this side and that.[5] She had not houses void of  families;[6] Sardanapalus had not yet arrived[7] there to show  what can be done in a chamber. Not yet by your Uccellatoio was  Montemalo surpassed, which, as it has been surpassed in its rise,  shall be so in its fall.[8] I saw Bellineoin Berti[9] go girt  with leather and bone,[10] and his dame come from her mirror  without a painted face. And I saw them of the Nerli, and them of  the Vecchio,[11] contented with the uncovered skin,[12] and their  dames with the spindle and the distaff. O fortunate women! Every  one was sure of her burial place;[13] and as yet no one was  deserted in her bed for France.[14] One over the cradle kept her  careful watch, and, comforting, she used the idiom which first  amuses fathers and mothers. Another, drawing the tresses from her  distaff, told tales to her household of the Trojans, and of  Fiesole, and of Rome.[15] A Cianghella,[16] a Lapo Salterello  would then have been held as great a marvel as Cincinnatus or  Cornelia would be now.    [1] But will and the discourse of reason, corresponding to  affection and intelligence, are unequal in mortals, owing to  their imperfection.    [2] Which makes it impossible for me to give full expression to  my gratitude and affection.    [3] Alighiero, from whom, it would appear from his station in  Purgatory, Dante inherited the sin of pride, as well as his name.    [4] The bell of the church called the Badia, or Abbey, which  stood within the old walls of Florence, rang daily the hours for  worship, and measured the time for the Florentines. Tierce is the  first division of the canonical hours of the day, from six to  nine; nones, the third, from twelve to three.    [5] They were not married so young as now, nor were such great  dowries required for them.    [6] Palaces too large for their occupants, built for ostentation.    [7] The luxury and effeminacy of Sardanapalus were proverbial.    [8] Not yet was the view from Montemalo, or Monte Mario, of Rome  in its splendor surpassed by that of Florence from the height of  Uccellatoio; and the fall of Florence shall be greater even than  that of Rome.    [9] Bellincion Berti was \"an honorable citizen of Florence,\" says  Giovanni Villani; \"a noble soldier,\" adds Benvenuto da Imola. He  was father of the \"good Gualdrada.\" See Hell, XVI.    [10] With a plain leathern belt fastened with a clasp of bone.    [11] Two ancient and honored families.    [12] Clothed in garments of plain dressed skin not covered with  cloth.    [13] Not fearing to die in exile.    [14] Left by her husband seeking fortune in France, or other for.  eign lands.    [15] These old tales may be read in the first book of Villani's  Chronicle.    [16] \"Mulier arrogantissima et intolerabilis . . . multum lubrice  vixit,\" says Benvenuto da Imola, who describes Lapo Salterello as  temerarius et pravus civis, vir litigiosus et linguosus.\"      \"To such a tranquil, to such a beautiful life of citizens, to  such a trusty citizenship, to such a sweet inn, Mary, called on  with loud cries,[1] gave me; and in your ancient Baptistery I  became at once a Christian and Cacciaguida. Moronto was my  brother, and Eliseo; my dame came to me from the valley of the  Po, and thence was thy surname. Afterward I followed the emperor  Conrad.[2] and he belted me of his soldiery,[3] so much by good  deeds did I come into his favor. Following him I went against the  iniquity of that law[4] whose people usurp your right,[5] though  fault of the shepherd. There by that base folk was I released  from the deceitful world, the love of which pollutes many souls,  and I came from martyrdom to this peace.\"    [1] The Virgin, called on in the pains of childbirth.    [2] Conrad III. of Suabia. In 1143 he joined in the second  Crusade.    [3] Made me a belted knight.    [4] The law of Mahomet.    [5] The Holy Land, by right belonging to the Christians.        CANTO XVI. The boast of blood.--Cacciaguida continues his  discourse concerning the old and the new Florence.    O thou small nobleness of our blood! If thou makest folk glory in  thee down here, where our affection languishes, it will nevermore  be a marvel to me; for there, where appetite is not perverted, I  mean in Heaven, I myself gloried in thee. Truly art thou a cloak  which quickly shortens, so that, if day by day it be not pieced,  Time goeth round about it with his shears.    With the YOU,[1] which Rome first tolerated, in which her family  least perseveres,[2] my words began again. Whereat Beatrice, who  was a little withdrawn,[3] smiling, seemed like her[4] who  coughed at the first fault that is written of Guenever. I began,  \"You are my father, you give me all confidence to speak; you lift  me so that I am more than I. Through so many streams is my mind  filled with gladness that it makes of itself a joy, in that it  can bear this and not burst.[5] Tell me then, beloved first  source of me, who were your ancestors, and what were the years  that were numbered in your boyhood. Tell me of the sheepfold of  St. John,[6] how large it was then, and who were the people  within it worthy of the highest seats.\"    [1] The plural pronoun, used as a mark of respect. This usage was  introduced in the later Roman Empire.    [2] The Romans no longer show respect to those worthy of it.    [3] Beatrice stands a little aside, theology having no part in  this colloquy. She smiles, not reproachfully, at Dante's  vainglory.    [4] The Dame de Malehault, who coughed at seeing the first kiss  given by Lancelot to Guenever. The incident is not told in any of  the printed versions of the Romance of Lancelot, but it has been  found by Mr. Paget Toynbee in several of the manuscripts.    [5] Rejoices that it has capacity to endure such great joy.    [6] Florence, whose patron saint"]]]
