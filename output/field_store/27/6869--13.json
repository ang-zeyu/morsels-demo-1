[62:1] Butler's lines, _A Description of Holland_, are very like  Marvell's:--        \"A Country that draws fifty foot of water      In which men live as in a hold of nature.      ...      ...      They dwell in ships, like swarms of rats, and prey      Upon the goods all nations' fleets convey;      ...      ...      That feed like cannibals on other fishes,      And serve their cousin-germans up in dishes:      A land that rides at anchor and is moor'd,      In which they do not live but go aboard.\"    Marvell and Butler were rival wits, but Holland was a common butt; so  powerful a motive is trade jealousy.    [67:1] \"To one unacquainted with Horace, this Ode, not perhaps so  perfect as his are in form, and with occasional obscurities of  expression, which Horace would not have left, will give a truer notion  of the kind of greatness which he achieved than could, so far as I know,  be obtained from any other poem in our language.\"--_Dean Trench_.    [70:1] \"In the last war, when France was disgraced and overpowered in  every quarter of the globe, when Spain coming to her assistance only  shared her calamities, and the name of an Englishman was reverenced  through Europe, no poet was heard amidst the general acclamation; the  fame of our counsellors and heroes was entrusted to the gazetteer.\"--Dr.  Johnson's _Life of Prior_.          CHAPTER IV    IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS      Cromwell's death was an epoch in Marvell's history. Up to that date he  had, since he left the University, led the life of a scholar, with a  turn for business, and was known to many as an agreeable companion and a  lively wit. He was keenly interested in public affairs, and personally  acquainted with some men in great place, and for a year before  Cromwell's death he had been in a branch of the Civil Service; but of  the wear and tear, the strife and contention, of what are called  \"practical politics\" he knew nothing from personal experience.    Within a year of the Protector's death all this was changed and, for the  rest of his days, with but the shortest of occasional intervals, Andrew  Marvell led the life of an active, eager member of Parliament, knowing  all that was going on in the Chamber and hearing of everything that was  alleged to be going on in the Court; busily occupied with the affairs of  his constituents in Hull, and daily watching, with an increasingly heavy  heart and a bitter humour, the corruption of the times, the declension  of our sea-power, the growing shame of England, and what he believed to  be a dangerous conspiracy afoot for the undoing of the Reformation and  the destruction of the Constitution in both Church and State.    \"Garden-poetry\" could not be reared on such a soil as this. The age of  Cromwell and Blake was over. The remainder of Marvell's life (save so  far as personal friendship sweetened it) was spent in politics, public  business, in concocting roughly rhymed and bitter satirical poems, and  in the composition of prose pamphlets.    Through it all Marvell remained very much the man of letters, though one  with a great natural aptitude for business. His was always the critical  attitude. He was the friend of Milton and Harrington, of the political  philosophers who invented paper constitutions in the \"Rota\" Club, and of  the new race of men whose thoughts turned to Natural Science, and who  founded the Royal Society. Office he never thought of. He could have had  it had he chosen, for he was a man of mark, even of distinction, from  the first. Clarendon has told us how members of the House of Commons  \"got on\" in the Long Parliament of Charles the Second. It was full of  the king's friends, who ran out of the House to tell their shrewd master  the gossip of the lobbies, \"commended this man and discommended another  who deserved better, and would many times, when His Majesty spoke well  of any man, ask His Majesty if he would give them leave to let that  person know how gracious His Majesty was to him, or bring him to kiss  his hand. To which he commonly consenting, every one of his servants  delivered some message from him to a Parliament man, and invited him to  Court, as if the King would be willing to see him. And by this means the  rooms at Court were always full of the members of the House of Commons.  This man brought to kiss his hand, and the King induced to confer with  that man and to thank him for his affection, which could never conclude  without some general expression of grace or promise, which the poor  gentleman always interpreted to his own advantage, and expected some  fruit from it that it could never yield.\"    The suspicious Clarendon, already shaking to his fall, goes on to add,  \"all which, being contrary to all former order, did the King no good,  and rendered those unable to do him service who were inclined to  it.\"[77:1]    It is a lifelike picture Clarendon draws of the crowded rooms, and of  the witty king moving about fooling vanity, ambition, and corruption to  the top of their bent. That the king chose his own ministers is plain  enough.    Marvell was at the beginning well disposed towards Charles. They had  some points in common; and among them a quick sense of humour and a turn  for business. But the member for Hull must soon have recognised that  there was no place for an honest quick-witted man in any Stuart  administration.    Marvell and his great chief remained in their offices until the close of  the year 1659, when the impending Restoration enforced their retirement.  Milton used his leisure to pour forth excited tracts to prove how easy  it would still be to establish a Free Commonwealth. Once again, and for  the last time, he prompted the age to quit its clogs        \"by the known rules of ancient liberty.\"    These pamphlets of Milton's prove how little that solitary thinker ever  knew of the real mind and temper of the English people.    The Lord Richard Cromwell was exactly the sort of eldest son a great  soldier like Oliver, who had put his foot on fortune's neck, was likely  to have. Richard (1626-1712) was not, indeed, born in the purple, but  his early manhood was nurtured in it. Religion, as represented by long  sermons, tiresome treatises, and prayerful exercises, bored him to  death. Of enthusiasm he had not a trace, nor was he bred to arms. He  delighted in hunting, in the open air, and the company of sportsmen.  Whatever came his way easily, and as a matter of right, he was well  content to take. He bore himself well on State occasions, and could make  a better speech than ever his father was able to do. But he was not a  \"restless\" Cromwell, and had no faith in his destiny. I do not know  whether he had ever read _Don Quixote_, in Shelton's translation, a very  popular book of the time; probably not, for, though Chancellor of the  University of Oxford, Richard was not a reading man, but if he had, he  must have sympathised with Sancho Panza's attitude of mind towards the  famous island.       \"If your highness has no mind that the government you promised should     be given me, God made me of less, and perhaps it may be easier for     Sancho, the Squire, to get to Heaven than for Sancho, the Governor.     _In the dark all cats are gray._\"    The new Protector took up the reins of power with proper forms and  ceremonies, and at once proceeded to summon a Parliament, an Imperial  Cromwellian Parliament, containing representatives both from Scotland  and Ireland. In this Parliament Andrew Marvell sat for the first time as  one of the two members for Kingston-upon-Hull. His election took place  on the 10th of January 1659, being the first county day after the  sheriff had received the writ. Five candidates were nominated: Thomas  Strickland, Andrew Marvell, John Ramsden, Henry Smyth, and Sir Henry  Vane, and a vote being taken in the presence of the mayor, aldermen, and  many of the burgesses, John Ramsden and Andrew Marvell were declared  duly elected.    Nobody to-day, glancing his eye over a list of the knights and  burgesses who made up Richard Cromwell's first and last Parliament,  would ever guess that it represented an order of things of the most  recent date which was just about to disappear. On paper it has a solid  look. The fine old crusted Parliamentary names with which the clerks  were to remain so long familiar as the members trooped out to divide  were more than well represented.[79:1] The Drakes of Amersham were  there; Boscawens, Bullers, and Trelawneys flocked from Cornwall; Sir  Wilfred Lawson sat for Cumberland, and his son for Cockermouth; a  Knightly represented Northamptonshire, whilst Lucys from Charlecote  looked after Warwick, both town and county. Arthur Onslow came from  Surrey, a Townshend from Norfolk, and, of course, a Bankes from Corfe  Castle;[79:2] Oxford University, contented, as she occasionally is, to  be represented by a great man, had chosen Sir Matthew Hale, whilst the  no less useful and laborious Thurloe sat for the sister University.  Anthony Ashley Cooper was there, but in opposition, snuffing the morrow.  Mildmays, Lawleys, Binghams, Herberts, Pelhams, all travelled up to  London with the Lord-Protector's writs in their pockets. A less  revolutionary assembly never met, though there was a regicide or two  among them. But when the members found themselves alone together there  was some loose talk.    On the 27th of January 1659 Marvell attended for the first time in his  place, when the new Protector opened Parliament, and made a speech in  the House of Lords, which was pronounced at the time to be \"a very  handsome oration.\"    The first business of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#14)"],[1,"stayed with her until  tea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little. But  just before Martha went down-stairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a  question.    \"Martha,\" she said, \"has the scullery-maid had the toothache again  to-day?\"    Martha certainly started slightly.    \"What makes thee ask that?\" she said.    \"Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door  and walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard that  far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There isn't a  wind to-day, so you see it couldn't have been the wind.\"    \"Eh!\" said Martha restlessly. \"Tha' mustn't go walkin' about in  corridors an' listenin'. Mr. Craven would be that there angry there's no  knowin' what he'd do.\"    \"I wasn't listening,\" said Mary. \"I was just waiting for you--and I  heard it. That's three times.\"    \"My word! There's Mrs. Medlock's bell,\" said Martha, and she almost ran  out of the room.    \"It's the strangest house any one ever lived in,\" said Mary drowsily, as  she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.  Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so  comfortably tired that she fell asleep.          CHAPTER X    DICKON      The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden. The Secret  Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked  the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful  old walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost like  being shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she had  read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret  gardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in them  for a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. She  had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming wider  awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning to like  to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. She  could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred. The  bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished. Such nice  clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space  they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to  cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The sun could get  at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them  at once, so they began to feel very much alive.    Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something  interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.  She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more  pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to  her like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of the  sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They seemed  to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny  new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. There  were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the  \"snowdrops by the thousands,\" and about bulbs spreading and making new  ones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they  had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long it  would be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes she  stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would  be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.    During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben  Weatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start up  beside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she was  afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming,  so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But, in fact,  he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. Perhaps he was  secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company.  Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He did not know that  when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a  native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not  accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to  do things.    \"Tha'rt like th' robin,\" he said to her one morning when he lifted his  head and saw her standing by him. \"I never knows when I shall see thee  or which side tha'll come from.\"    \"He's friends with me now,\" said Mary.    \"That's like him,\" snapped Ben Weatherstaff. \"Makin' up to th' women  folk just for vanity an' flightiness. There's nothin' he wouldn't do for  th' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his tail-feathers. He's as full o'  pride as an egg's full o' meat.\"    He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary's  questions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual.  He stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while  he looked her over.    \"How long has tha' been here?\" he jerked out.    \"I think it's about a month,\" she answered.    \"Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,\" he said. \"Tha's a bit  fatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller. Tha' looked like a  young plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden. Thinks I to  myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young 'un.\"    Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was  not greatly disturbed.    \"I know I'm fatter,\" she said. \"My stockings are getting tighter. They  used to make wrinkles. There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.\"    There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever.  His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and  tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively  graces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. But  Ben was sarcastic.    \"Aye, there tha' art!\" he said. \"Tha' can put up with me for a bit  sometimes when tha's got no one better. Tha's been reddinin' up thy  waistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha's  up to. Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere, tellin' thy lies  to her about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready to  fight all th' rest of 'em.\"    \"Oh! look at him!\" exclaimed Mary.    The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closer  and closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. He  flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a  little song right at him.    \"Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,\" said Ben, wrinkling his  face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to look  pleased. \"Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee--that's what  tha' thinks.\"    The robin spread his wings--Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. He  flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted on  the top of it. Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new  expression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe--as if he  would not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.  He spoke quite in a whisper.    \"Well, I'm danged!\" he said as softly as if he were saying something  quite different. \"Tha' does know how to get at a chap--tha' does! Tha's  fair unearthly, tha's so knowin'.\"    And he stood without stirring--almost without drawing his breath--until  the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stood  looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and  then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.    But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not  afraid to talk to him.    \"Have you a garden of your own?\" she asked.    \"No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate.\"    \"If you had one,\" said Mary, \"what would you plant?\"    \"Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions.\"    \"But if you wanted to make a flower garden,\" persisted Mary, \"what would  you plant?\"    \"Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things--but mostly roses.\"    Mary's face lighted up.    \"Do you like roses?\" she said.    Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered.    \"Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.  She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an' she loved 'em like they  was children--or robins. I've seen her bend over an' kiss 'em.\" He  dragged out another weed and scowled at it. \"That were as much as ten  year' ago.\"    \"Where is she now?\" asked Mary, much interested.    \"Heaven,\" he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, \"'cording  to what parson says.\"    \"What happened to the roses?\" Mary asked again, more interested than  ever.    \"They was left to themselves.\"    Mary was becoming quite excited.    \"Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to  themselves?\" she ventured.    \"Well, I'd got to like 'em--an' I liked her--an' she liked 'em,\" Ben  Weatherstaff admitted reluctantly. \"Once or twice a year I'd go an' work  at 'em a bit--prune 'em an' dig about th' roots. They run wild, but they  was in rich soil, so some of 'em lived.\"    \"When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you  tell whether they are dead or alive?\" inquired Mary.    \"Wait till th' spring gets at 'em--wait till th' sun shines on th' rain  an' th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out.\"    \"How--how?\" cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.    \"Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' sees a bit of a brown  lump swelling here an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see what  happens.\" He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.  \"Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?\" he  demanded.    Mistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer. "]]]
