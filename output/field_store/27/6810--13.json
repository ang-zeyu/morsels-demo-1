Helvetius was the  protector of men of genius, whom he assisted not only with his  criticism, but his fortune. At his death, Saurin read in the French  Academy an epistle to the manes of his friend. Saurin, wrestling with  obscurity and poverty, had been drawn into literary existence by the  supporting hand of Helvetius. Our poet thus addresses him in the warm  tones of gratitude:        C'est toi qui me cherchant au sein de l'infortune,        Relevas mon sort abattu,      Et sus me rendre chere une vie importune.            * * * *        Qu'importent ces pleurs--      O douleur impuissante! o regrets superflus!      Je vis, helas! Je vis, et mon ami n'est plus!                           IMITATED.        In misery's haunts, thy friend thy bounties seize,      And give an urgent life some days of ease;      Ah! ye vain griefs, superfluous tears I chide!      I live, alas! I live--and thou hast died!    The literary friendship of a father with his son is one of the rarest  alliances in the republic of letters. It was gratifying to the feelings  of young Gibbon, in the fervour of literary ambition, to dedicate his  first-fruits to his father. The too lively son of Crebillon, though his  was a very different genius to the grandeur of his father's, yet  dedicated his works to him, and for a moment put aside his wit and  raillery for the pathetic expressions of filial veneration. We have had  a remarkable instance in the two Richardsons; and the father, in his  original manner, has in the most glowing language expressed his  affectionate sentiments. He says, \"My time of learning was employed in  business; but after all, I have the Greek and Latin tongues, because a  part of me possesses them, to whom I can recur at pleasure, just as I  have a hand when I would write or paint, feet to walk, and eyes to see.  My son is my learning, as I am that to him which he has not.--We make  one man, and such a compound man may probably produce what no single man  can.\" And further, \"I always think it my peculiar happiness to be as it  were enlarged, expanded, made another man, by the acquisition of my son;  and he thinks in the same manner concerning my union with him.\" This is  as curious as it is uncommon; however the cynic may call it egotism!    Some for their friend have died penetrated with inconsolable grief; some  have sacrificed their character to preserve his own; some have shared  their limited fortune; and some have remained attached to their friend  in the cold season of adversity.    Jurieu denounced Bayle as an impious writer, and drew his conclusions  from the \"Avis aux Refugies.\" This work is written against the  Calvinists, and therefore becomes impious in Holland. Bayle might have  exculpated himself with facility, by declaring the work was composed by  La Roque; but he preferred to be persecuted rather than to ruin his  friend; he therefore was silent, and was condemned. When the minister  Fouquet was abandoned by all, it was the men of letters he had  patronised who never forsook his prison; and many have dedicated their  works to great men in their adversity, whom they scorned to notice at  the time when they were noticed by all. The learned Goguet bequeathed  his MSS. and library to his friend Fugere, with whom he had united his  affections and his studies. His work on the \"Origin of the Arts and  Sciences\" had been much indebted to his aid. Fugere, who knew his friend  to be past recovery, preserved a mute despair, during the slow and  painful disease; and on the death of Goguet, the victim of sensibility  perished amidst the manuscripts which his friend had in vain bequeathed  to prepare for publication. The Abbe de Saint Pierre gave an interesting  proof of literary friendship. When he was at college he formed a union  with Varignon, the geometrician. They were of congenial dispositions.  When he went to Paris he invited Varignon to accompany him; but Varignon  had nothing, and the Abbe was far from rich. A certain income was  necessary for the tranquil pursuits of geometry. Our Abbe had an income  of 1800 livres; from this he deducted 300, which he gave to the  geometrician, accompanied by a delicacy which few but a man of genius  could conceive. \"I do not give it to you,\" he said, \"as a salary, but an  annuity, that you may be independent, and quit me when you dislike me.\"  Something nearly similar embellishes our own literary history. When  Akenside was in great danger of experiencing famine as well as fame, Mr.  Dyson allowed him three hundred pounds a year. Of this gentleman,  perhaps, nothing is known; yet whatever his life may be, it merits the  tribute of the biographer. To close with these honourable testimonies of  literary friendship, we must not omit that of Churchill and Lloyd. It is  known that when Lloyd heard of the death of our poet, he acted the part  which Fugere did to Goguet. The page is crowded, but my facts are by no  means exhausted.    The most illustrious of the ancients prefixed the name of some friend to  the head of their works.--We too often place that of some patron. They  honourably inserted it in their works. When a man of genius, however,  shows that he is not less mindful of his social affection than his fame,  he is the more loved by his reader. Plato communicated a ray of his  glory to his brothers; for in his Republic he ascribes some parts to  Adimanthus and Glauchon; and Antiphon the youngest is made to deliver  his sentiments in the Parmenides, To perpetuate the fondness of  friendship, several authors have entitled their works by the name of  some cherished associate. Cicero to his Treatise on Orators gave the  title of Brutus; to that of Friendship, Lelius; and to that of Old Age,  Cato. They have been imitated by the moderns. The poetical Tasso to his  dialogue on Friendship gave the name of Manso, who was afterwards his  affectionate biographer. Sepulvueda entitles his Treatise on Glory by  the name of his friend Gonsalves. Lociel to his Dialogues on the Lawyers  of Paris prefixes the name of the learned Pasquier. Thus Plato  distinguishes his Dialogues by the names of certain persons; the one on  Lying is entitled Hippius; on Rhetoric, Gorgias; and on Beauty, Phaedrus.    Luther has perhaps carried this feeling to an extravagant point. He was  so delighted by his favourite \"Commentary on the Epistle to the  Galatians,\" that he distinguished it by a title of doting fondness; he  named it after his wife, and called it \"His Catherine.\"          ANECDOTES OF ABSTRACTION OF MIND.      Some have exercised this power of abstraction to a degree that appears  marvellous to volatile spirits, and puny thinkers.    To this patient habit, Newton is indebted for many of his great  discoveries; an apple falls upon him in his orchard,--and the system of  attraction succeeds in his mind! he observes boys blowing soap bubbles,  and the properties of light display themselves! Of Socrates, it is said,  that he would frequently remain an entire day and night in the same  attitude, absorbed in meditation; and why should we doubt this, when we  know that La Fontaine and Thomson, Descartes and Newton, experienced the  same abstraction? Mercator, the celebrated geographer, found such  delight in the ceaseless progression of his studies, that he would never  willingly quit his maps to take the necessary refreshments of life. In  Cicero's Treatise on Old Age, Cato applauds Gallus, who, when he sat  down to write in the morning, was surprised by the evening; and when he  took up his pen in the evening was surprised by the appearance of the  morning. Buffon once described these delicious moments with his  accustomed eloquence:--\"Invention depends on patience; contemplate your  subject long; it will gradually unfold, till a sort of electric spark  convulses for a moment the brain, and spreads down to the very heart a  glow of irritation. Then come the luxuries of genius! the true hours for  production and composition; hours so delightful, that I have spent  twelve and fourteen successively at my writing-desk, and still been in a  state of pleasure.\" The anecdote related of Marini, the Italian poet,  may be true. Once absorbed in revising his Adonis, he suffered his leg  to be burnt for some time, without any sensation.    Abstraction of this sublime kind is the first step to that noble  enthusiasm which accompanies Genius; it produces those raptures and that  intense delight, which some curious facts will explain to us.    Poggius relates of Dante, that he indulged his meditations more strongly  than any man he knew! whenever he read, he was only alive to what was  passing in his mind; to all human concerns, he was as if they had not  been! Dante went one day to a great public procession; he entered the  shop of a bookseller to be a spectator of the passing show. He found a  book which greatly interested him; he devoured it in silence, and  plunged into an abyss of thought. On his return he declared that he had  neither seen, nor heard, the slightest occurrence of the public  exhibition which had passed before him. This enthusiasm renders  everything surrounding us as distant as if an immense interval separated  us from the scene. A modern astronomer, one summer night, withdrew to  his chamber; the brightness of the heaven showed a phenomenon. He passed  the whole night in observing it, and when they came to him early in the  morning, and found him in the same attitude, he said, like one who had  been recollecting his thoughts for a few moments, \"It must be thus; but  I'll go to bed before 'tis late!\" He had gazed the entire night in  meditation, and did not know it.    This intense abstraction operates visibly; this perturbation of the  faculties, as might be supposed, affects persons of genius physically.  What a forcible description the late Madame Roland, who certainly was a  woman of the first genius, gives of herself "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#14)"],[1,"step in this  classification of sounds; and he went further than this, for  he also classified the _emotions_ affected by music. It was  therefore a natural consequence that in his teaching he should  forbid music of an emotional character as injurious. When he  came to Crotona, it was to a city that vied with Agrigentum,  Sybaris, and Tarentum in luxury; its chief magistrate wore  purple garments, a golden crown upon his head, and white  shoes on his feet. It was said of Pythagoras that he had  studied twelve years with the Magi in the temples of Babylon;  had lived among the Druids of Gaul and the Indian Brahmins; had  gone among the priests of Egypt and witnessed their most secret  temple rites. So free from care or passion was his face that  he was thought by the people to be Apollo; he was of majestic  presence, and the most beautiful man they had ever seen. So  the people accepted him as a superior being, and his influence  became supreme over science and art, as well as manners.    He gave the Greeks their first scientific analysis of sound.  The legend runs that, passing a blacksmith's shop and  hearing the different sounds of the hammering, he conceived  the idea that sounds could be measured by some such means  as weight is measured by scales, or distance by the foot  rule. By weighing the different hammers, so the story goes,  he obtained the knowledge of harmonics or overtones, namely,  the fundamental, octave, fifth, third, etc. This legend, which  is stated seriously in many histories of music, is absurd, for,  as we know, the hammers would not have vibrated. The anvils  would have given the sound, but in order to produce the octave,  fifth, etc., they would have had to be of enormous proportions.  On the other hand, the monochord, with which students in physics  are familiar, was his invention; and the first mathematical  demonstrations of the effect on musical pitch of length of  cord and tension, as well as the length of pipes and force of  breath, were his.    These mathematical divisions of the monochord, however,  eventually did more to stifle music for a full thousand years  than can easily be imagined. This division of the string  made what we call harmony impossible; for by it the major  third became a larger interval than our modern one, and the  minor third smaller. Thus thirds did not sound well together,  in fact were dissonances, the only intervals which _did_  harmonize being the fourth, fifth, and octave. This system  of mathematically dividing tones into equal parts held good  up to the middle of the sixteenth century, when Zarlino, who  died in 1590, invented the system in use at the present time,  called the _tempered scale_, which, however, did not come into  general use until one hundred years later.    Aristoxenus, a pupil of Aristotle, who lived more than a  century after Pythagoras, rejected the monochord as a means for  gauging musical sounds, believing that the ear, not mathematical  calculation, should be the judge as to which interval sounds  \"perfect.\" But he was unable to formulate a system that  would bring the third (and naturally its inversion the sixth)  among the harmonizing intervals or consonants. Didymus (about  30 B.C.) first discovered that two different-sized whole  tones were necessary in order to make the third consonant;  and Ptolemy (120 A.D.) improved on this system somewhat. But  the new theory remained without any practical effect until  nearly the seventeenth century, when the long respected theory  of the perfection of mathematical calculation on the basis of  natural phenomena was overthrown in favour of actual effect. If  Aristoxenus had had followers able to combat the crushing  influence of Euclid and his school, music might have grown up  with the other arts. As it is, music is still in its infancy,  and has hardly left its experimental stage.    Thus Pythagoras brought order into the music as well as  into the lives of people. But whereas it ennobled the  people, it killed the music, the one vent in life through  which unbounded utterance is possible; its essence is so  interwoven with spirituality that to tear it away and fetter  it with human mathematics is to lower it to the level of mere  utilitarianism. And so it was with Greek music, which was held  subordinate to metre, to poetry, to acting, and finally became  a term of contempt. Pythagoras wished to banish the flute,  as Plato also did later, and the name of flute player was used  as a reproach. I fancy this was because the flute, on account  of its construction, could ignore the mathematical divisions  prescribed for the stringed instruments, and therefore could  indulge in purely emotional music. Besides, the flute was  the chosen instrument of the orgiastic Bacchic cult, and its  associations were those of unbridled license. To be sure, the  voice was held by no mathematical restrictions as to pitch;  but its music was held in check by the words, and its metre  by dancing feet.    Having measured the musical intervals, there still remained  the task of classifying the different manners of singing which  existed in Greece, and using all their different notes to form  a general system. For just as in different parts of Greece  there existed different dances, the steps of which were known  as Lydian, Ionian, Locrian, and Dorian feet, and so on, so the  melodies to which they were danced were known as being in the  Lydian, Ionian, Locrian, or Dorian scale or mode. In speaking  of Hindu music, I explained that what we call a mode consists  of a scale, and that one mode differs from another _only_ in  the position of the semitones in this scale. Now in ancient  Greece there were in use over fifteen different modes, each one  common to the part of the country in which it originated. At the  time of Pythagoras there were seven in general use: the Dorian,  Lydian, Aeolian or Locrian, Hypo- (or low) Lydian, Phrygian,  Hypo- (or low) Phrygian, and Mixolydian or mixed Lydian. The  invention of the latter is attributed to Sappho by Plutarch,  quoting Aristoxenus.    These modes were all invested with individual characters  by the Greeks, just as in the present day we say our major  mode is happy, the minor sad. The Dorian mode was considered  the greatest, and, according to Plato, the only one worthy of  men. It was supposed to have a dignified, martial character. The  Lydian, on the other hand, was all softness, and love songs  were written in it. The Phrygian was of a violent, ecstatic  nature, and was considered as being especially appropriate for  dithyrambs, the metre for the wild bacchanalian dances. For  instance, Aristotle tells how Philoxenus attempted to set  dithyrambic verse to the Dorian mode, and, failing, had to  return to the Phrygian. The Mixolydian, which was Sappho's mode,  was the mode for sentiment and passion. The Dorian, Phrygian,  and Lydian were the oldest modes.    Each mode or scale was composed of two sets of four notes,  called tetrachords, probably derived from the ancient form  of the lyre, which in Homer's time is known to have had four  strings.    Leaving the matter of actual pitch out of the question (for  these modes might be pitched high or low, just as our major  or minor scale may be pitched in different keys), these three  modes were constructed as follows:      Greek      Dorian    (E F) G A   (B C) D E,                           that is, semitone, tone, tone.               /            |  Phrygian  D (E F) G   A (B C) D,            |              or F[#] (G[#] A) B   C[#] (D[#] E) F[#],    Asiatic |              that is, tone, semitone, tone.            |            |  Lydian    C D (E F)   G A (B C),             \\              that is, tone, tone, semitone.    Thus we see that a tetrachord commencing with a half-tone and  followed by two whole tones was called a Dorian tetrachord;  one commencing with a tone, followed by a half-tone, and again  a tone, constituted a Phrygian tetrachord. The other modes  were as follows: In the Aeolian or Locrian the semitones occur  between the second and third notes, and the fifth and sixth:  [F: b, (c+ d) e (f+ g) a b]  Theraclides Ponticus identifies the Hypodorian with the Aeolian,  but says that the name \"hypo-\" merely denoted a likeness to  Doric, not to pitch. Aristoxenus denies the identity, and  says that the Hypodorian was a semitone below the Dorian or  Hypolydian. In the Hypophrygian, the semitones occur between  the third and fourth, and sixth and seventh degrees:  [F: c+ d+ (e+ f+) g+ (a+ b) c+']  In the Hypolydian, the semitones occur between the fourth and  fifth, and seventh and eighth: [F: e- f g (a b-) c' (d' e-')]  The Dorian (E), Phrygian (commencing on F[sharp] with the fourth  sharped), and the Lydian (A[flat] major scale) modes we have  already explained. In the Mixolydian, the semitones occur  between the first and second, and fourth and fifth degrees:  [G: (a b-) c' (d' e-') f' g' a']    According to the best evidence (in the works of Ptolemy,  \"Harmonics,\" second book, and Aristides), these were  approximately the actual pitch of the modes as compared one  to another.    And now the difficulty was to weld all these modes together  into one scale, so that all should be represented and yet not  be complicated by what we should call accidentals. This was  accomplished in the following manner, by simple mathematical  means:    We remember that the Dorian, which was the most greatly  favoured mode in Greece, was divided into two tetrachords of  exactly the same proportions, namely, semitone, tone, tone. By  taking the lowest note of the Mixolydian, B, and forming a  Dorian tetrachord on it, B C D E were acquired. Adding to this  another Dorian tetrachord, E F G A (commencing on the last note  of the first), and repeating the same series of tetrachords  an octave higher, we have in all four Dorian tetrachords,  two of which overlap the others. The two middle tetrachords,  constituting the "]]]
