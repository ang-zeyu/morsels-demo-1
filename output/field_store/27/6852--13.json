It has been  stated since that had the Allies continued the attack one more day the  Turks would have had to yield, as their ammunition was nearly exhausted.  In April troops were landed on the peninsula to aid in the attack. The  landing was accomplished at a terrible cost of life. Siege operations  were then begun against the Turkish and German forces defending the  peninsula. Month after month the fighting continued, but nothing worth  while was accomplished. Finally, in January of the next year, the  campaign was abandoned. It had cost the Allies heavily in money and  lives, and its failure had lost to them the respect of the hesitating  nations of southeastern Europe, Bulgaria and Greece.    THE WAR ON THE RUSSIAN BORDER.--Along the Russian frontier also the  Allied cause met with serious reverses. The year had opened favorably  with the Russians in control of most of Galicia. In March the great  Galician fortress of Przemysl, which had successfully withstood the  attacks of the Russians the previous autumn, was compelled to surrender.    Meanwhile, in January, Russia once more attempted to carry out the other  part of her general plan, the invasion of East Prussia. The Russian  troops succeeded as before in entering the coveted territory, this time  crossing the troublesome lake region while the waters were frozen. Soon,  however, the invaders met with a decisive defeat. In the Battle of the  Mazurian Lakes, General Von Hindenburg took 100,000 Russian prisoners;  the number of killed and wounded Russian soldiers is said to have been  150,000. The Russians hurriedly retreated from German soil.    The time had now come for the Germans and Austrians definitely to assume  the offensive. A strategic blow in Galicia imperiled the whole Russian  front and compelled a general retreat of the Russian armies in Galicia  and Poland. In June both Przemysl and Lemberg were recaptured by the  Central Powers. By September all of Russian Poland had been conquered.  Russia had lost 65,000 square miles of thickly populated territory. But  the land was so thoroughly plundered by the German conquerors that many  of the people died of starvation.    BULGARIA ENTERS THE WAR.--The sympathies of the Bulgarian government  had been with the Central Powers from the beginning of the war. Bulgaria  had not forgiven the neighboring Balkan states for their treatment of  her in the second Balkan war (1913). Against Serbia her feeling was  particularly bitter. The Allied disaster at Gallipoli and the military  successes of Germany and Austria in Poland and Galicia in the spring and  summer of 1915 led the Bulgarians to believe that now was the time for  them to strike. In October Bulgaria declared war upon Serbia, thus  definitely taking her stand as an ally of the Central Powers.    Bulgaria's entrance into the war was followed by simultaneous invasions  of Serbia from Austria and from Bulgaria. Under these blows the Serbians  were crushed. Together with her neighbor and ally, brave little  Montenegro, Serbia was overrun by her enemies. The cruelties inflicted  upon the Serbian population by the invading Bulgars are said to have  been fully as horrible as those which had taken place during the  conquest of Belgium in 1914 and of Poland in 1915.    There was serious danger that the government of Greece would follow the  lead of Bulgaria and also enter the war on the side of the Central  Powers. This was prevented by two things. In the first place, a majority  of the Greek people favored the cause of the Allies and were opposed to  Bulgaria. In the second place, the Allies promptly landed an army at  Salonica. Later on, they removed Constantine, the pro-German king of  Greece, and placed his son Alexander upon the throne.    THE EAST AT THE CLOSE OF 1915.--On the eastern front 1915 had been a  year of failure. The Gallipoli campaign had been a humiliation for the  Allies. The Russians had been driven from Russian Poland and from the  Austrian province of Galicia. Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers,  linking Austria-Hungary with Turkey. Serbia, the country whose quarrel  had been the occasion of the whole world struggle, had been conquered by  the enemies of the Allies.    ITALY ENTERS THE WAR.--In May, 1915, Italy declared war upon Austria,  and more than a year later upon Germany. Her reasons for this action  were: (1) her old enmity toward Austria; (2) her desire to annex the  neighboring territory inhabited by Italians, but ruled by Austria; and  (3) her feeling that Austria was opposed to Italian interests in the  Balkans.    Italy entered the war with vigor although at a great disadvantage. When  the northern Italian lands were freed from Austrian rule in 1866,  Austria kept the highlands and mountain passes, from which she could  easily descend upon the Italian lowlands. Now that war was begun, the  Italians were compelled to force their way up the heights and against  the fire from well-protected Austrian forts. Here upon the dizzy peaks  of the Alps, or the icy surfaces of glaciers, or the rocky mountain  sides, warfare has been more spectacular and has called for more daring  and recklessness than anywhere else. Slides of rock and avalanches of  ice sometimes have been the ammunition of armies. During the year the  Italians made some progress and by December occupied positions well  within the Austrian frontier; but no decisive battle had been fought or  important city or fortress occupied.    ALLIED CONTROL OF THE SEA.--Throughout 1915--as in the preceding and  the following years--the Allies maintained their control of the ocean.  As a result of a proclamation declaring the North Sea a military area,  and the more strict enforcement of the proclamation against sending  contraband articles to Germany, the blockade against the Central Powers  was more tightly drawn.    This seriously affected the commerce of the United States, not only with  Germany but with neutral countries, such as Holland or Sweden, that  could easily transship to Germany the supplies received. Neutral vessels  were stopped and taken into Allied ports, there to be detained sometimes  for long periods until a decision was reached as to the legality of  their traffic. Moreover, the expense of this detention was laid upon the  owners of the vessel and cargo. These acts brought forth a series of  protests by our government against the policy of the Allies. The  correspondence continued with varying results until the United States  entered the war.    FORCED DECREASE OF NEUTRAL TRADE WITH GERMANY.--Neutral countries  adjoining Germany had been making huge profits by selling their food and  other products to Germany, replacing their stores with material imported  from over seas. As part of the preparation for a long war, the Allies  blocked the renewal of neutral stocks of goods. The neutral countries  complained vigorously, but they soon cut down their trade with Germany  since they were no longer able to replenish their stock of food, rubber,  metals, and other supplies.    SUBMARINE WARFARE.--In 1914, when the war broke out, Germany is said  to have had but four seaworthy submarines. It is difficult to believe  that she had so few, but it is certain that she did not have so many as  either England, France, or Russia. German naval authorities were not  convinced of the value of the submarine in war.    However, about a month after the war began, a German submarine torpedoed  a British cruiser, and, within a few minutes, two others that had gone  to assist the first. Germany, now realizing the value of the new weapon,  began the construction of a numerous fleet of underwater boats, or  U-boats. But against war ships, properly defended by guns and other  means, they proved of little avail after all. Toward the end of the  year, Admiral von Tirpitz, head of the German navy, hinted at an  extension of the use of submarines to attack merchant ships.    Soon numbers of the submarines made their way to the waters surrounding  the British Isles, where they torpedoed merchant vessels taking food and  supplies to Great Britain and France. The vessels sunk were chiefly  British, though some were neutral.    PROTECTION AGAINST SUBMARINES.--Large war ships were protected from  submarines by keeping them in a mine-protected area until there was need  for them at sea. At sea they were protected largely by the patrol and  scouting operations carried on by lighter and faster vessels. To reduce  the danger to merchant vessels from submarines, harbors and sea lanes  were protected by mines and by great nets made of heavy wire cables. The  seas in the immediate vicinity of Great Britain were patrolled by  thousands of small, swift vessels constantly in search of U-boats.    ATTEMPTED BLOCKADE OF GREAT BRITAIN.--In February, 1915, Germany  declared a blockade of the British Isles. Under an actual blockade she  would have the right to prevent neutral vessels from trading with Great  Britain. But inasmuch as it was not possible to take seized neutral  ships to German ports, the submarines would sink them, often without  providing for the safety of the passengers and crews. The ultimate  object of this course of action was so to reduce the world's shipping as  to make it impossible for Great Britain to be supplied with the food or  other materials that would enable her to carry on the war. This method  of warfare, however, was contrary to the well established rules of  international law. Against it the United States and other neutrals made  vigorous protests.    THE LUSITANIA.--The most notable loss by submarine attack was that of  the \"Lusitania,\" sunk without warning off the coast of Ireland on May 7,  1915. Nearly twelve hundred lives were lost, including many women and  children. One hundred and fourteen of those lost were Americans.
