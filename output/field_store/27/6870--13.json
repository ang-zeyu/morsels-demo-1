The  profusely illustrated folders that used blue print for emphasis here and  there, seemed no longer to satisfy them.    The Happy Family did not worry much about the old farmers who knew the  game, but there were town men who had come to see the fulfillment of  their dreams; who had burned their bridges, some of them, and would  suffer much before they would turn back to face the ridicule of their  friends and the disheartening task of getting; a fresh foothold in the  wage-market. These the Happy Family knew for incipient enemies once  the struggle for existence was fairly begun. And there were the  women--daring rivals of the men in their fight for independence--who  had dreamed dreams and raised up ideals for which they would fight  tenaciously. School-teachers who hated the routine of the schools, and  who wanted freedom; who were willing to work and wait and forego the  little, cheap luxuries which are so dear to women; who would cheerfully  endure loneliness and spoiled complexions and roughened hands and broken  nails, and see the prairie winds and sun wipe the sheen from their  hair; who would wear coarse, heavy-soled shoes and keep all their pretty  finery packed carefully away in their trunks with dainty sachet pads  for month after month, and take all their pleasure in dreaming of the  future; these would fight also to have and to hold--and they would fight  harder than the men, more dangerously than the men, because they would  fight differently.    The Happy Family, then, having recognized these things and having  measured the fighting-element, knew that they were squarely up against  a slow, grim, relentless war if they would save the Flying U. They knew  that it was going to be a pretty stiff proposition, and that they would  have to obey strictly the letter and the spirit of the land laws, or  there would be contests and quarrels and trouble without end.    So they hammered and sawed and fitted boards and nailed on tar-paper and  swore and jangled and joshed one another and counted nickels--where they  used to disdain counting anything but results--and badgered the life out  of Patsy because he kicked at being expected to cook for the bunch just  the same as if he were in the Flying U mess-house. Py cosh, he wouldn't  cook for the whole country just because they were too lazy to cook for  themselves, and py cosh if they wanted him to cook for them they could  pay him sixty dollars a month, as the Old Man did.    The Happy Family were no millionaires, and they made the fact plain to  Patsy to the full extent of their vocabularies. But still they begged  bread from him, a loaf at a time, and couldn't see why he objected to  making pie, if they furnished the stuff. Why, for gosh sake, had they  planted him in the very middle of their string of claims, then? With a  dandy spring too, that never went dry except in the driest years, and  not more than seventy-five yards, at the outside, to carry water. Up  hill? Well, what of that? Look at Pink--had to haul water half a mile  from One Man Creek, and no trail. Look at Weary--had to pack water twice  as far as Patsy. And hadn't they clubbed together and put up his darned  shack first thing, just so he COULD get busy and cook? What did the old  devil expect, anyway?    Well--you see that the Happy Family had been fully occupied in the  week since the arrival of the homeseekers' excursion. They could not be  expected to give very much thought to their next steps. But there was  Andy, who had only to move into the cabin in One Man coulee, with a  spring handy, and a stable for his horse, and a corral and everything.  Andy had not been harassed with the house-building and settling, except  as he assisted the others. As fast as the shacks were up, the Happy  Family had taken possession, so that now Andy was alone, stuck down  there in the coulee out of sight of everybody. Pink had once named One  Man coulee as the lonesomest hole in all that country, and he had not  been far wrong. But at any rate the lonesomeness had served one good  purpose, for it had started Andy to thinking out the details of their so  called land-pool. Now the thinking had borne fruit to the extent that he  felt an urgent need of the Happy Family in council upon the subject.    As he topped at last the final rise which put him on a level with the  great undulating bench-land gashed here and there with coulees and  narrow gulches that gave no evidence of their existence until one rode  quite close, he lifted his head and gazed about him half regretfully,  half proudly. He hated to see that wide upland dotted here and there  with new, raw buildings, which proclaimed themselves claim-shacks as far  a one could see them. Andy hated the sight of claim-shacks with a hatred  born of long range experience and the vital interests of the cattleman.  A claim-shack stuck out on the prairie meant a barbed wire fence  somewhere in the immediate vicinity; and that meant a hindrance to the  easy handling of herds. A claim-shack meant a nester, and a nester was a  nuisance, with his plowed fields and his few head of cattle that must  be painstakingly weeded out of a herd to prevent a howl going up to high  heaven. Therefore, Andy Green instinctively hated the sight of a shack  on the prairie. On the other hand, those shacks belonged to the Happy  Family--and that pleased him. From where he sat on his horse he could  count five in sight, and there were more hidden by ridges and tucked  away in hollows.    But there were others going up--shacks whose owners he did not know.  He scowled when he saw, on distant hilltops, the yellow skeletons  that would presently be fattened with boards and paper and made the  dwelling-place of interlopers. To be sure, they had as much right to  take government land as had he or any of his friends--but Andy, being a  normally selfish person, did not think so.    From one partially built shack three quarters of a mile away on a bald  ridge which the Happy Family had passed up because of its barrenness and  the barrenness of the coulee on the other side, and because no one was  willing to waste even a desert right on that particular eighty-acres,  a team and light buggy came swiftly toward him. Andy, trained to quick  thinking, was puzzled at the direction the driver was taking. That  eighty acres joined his own west line, and unless the driver was lost  or on the way to One Man coulee, there was no reason whatever for coming  this way.    He watched and saw that the team was comin' straight toward him over  the uneven prairie sod, and at a pace that threatened damage to the  buggy-springs. Instinctively Andy braced himself in the saddle. At a  half mile he knew the team, and it did not require much shrewdness to  guess at the errand. He twitched the reins, turned his spurred heels  against his horse and went loping over the grassland to meet the person  who drove in such haste; and the probability that he was meeting trouble  halfway only sent him the more eagerly forward.    Trouble met him with hard, brown eyes and corn yellow hair blown in  loose strands across cheeks roughened by the spring winds and sun-glare  of Montana. Trouble pulled up and twisted sidewise in the seat and  kicked the heads off some wild larkspurs with her whip while her tongue  flayed the soul of Andy Green with sarcasm.    \"Well, I have found out just how you helped me colonize this tract, Mr.  Green,\" she began with a hard inflection under the smoothness of her  voice. \"I must compliment you upon your promptness and thoroughness in  the matter; for an amateur you have made a remarkable showing--in--in  treachery and deceit. I really did not suppose you had it in you.\"    \"Remember, I told you I might buy in if it looked good to me,\" Andy  reminded her in the mildest tone of which he was capable--and he could  be as mild as new milk when he chose.    Florence Grace Hallman looked at him with a lift of her full upper lip  at the left side. \"It does look good, then? You told Mr. Graham and that  Mr. Wirt a different story, Mr. Green. You told them this land won't  raise white beans, and you were at some pains, I believe, to explain why  it would not. You convinced them, by some means or other, that the whole  tract is practically worthless for agricultural purposes. Both Mr.  Wirt and Mr. Graham had some capital to invest here, and now they are  leaving, and they have persuaded several others to leave with them. Does  it really look good to you--this land proposition?\"    \"Not your proposition--no, it don't.\" Andy faced her with a Keen level  glance as hard as her own. One could get the truth straight from the  shoulder if one pushed Andy Green into a corner. \"You know and I know  that you're trying to cold-deck this bunch. The land won't raise white  beans or anything else without water, and you know it. You can plant  folks on the land and collect your money and tell 'em goodbye and go to  it--and that settles your part of it. But how about the poor devils that  put in their time and money?\"    Florence Grace Hallman spread her hands in a limited gesture because of  the reins, and smiled unpleasantly. \"And yet, you nearly broke your neck  filing on the land yourself and getting a lot of your friends to file,\"  she retorted. \"What was your object, Mr. Green--since the land is  worthless?\"    \"My object don't matter to anyone but myself.\" Andy busied himself with  his smoking material and did not look at her.    \"Oh, but it Does! It matters to me, Mr. Green, and to my company, and to  our clients.\"    \"I'll have to buy me a new dictionary,\" Andy observed casually, reaching  behind him to scratch a match on the skirt of his saddle. \"The one I've  got don't say anything about 'client' and 'victim' meaning the same  thing. It's getting all outa date.\"    \"I brought enough clients\"--she emphasized the word--\"to settle every  eighty acres of land in that whole tract. The policy of the company"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#14)"],[1,"in Chapter III that from the point of view of kinship  organisations Australia falls into three main areas--occupied by the  classless two-phratry, the four-class and the eight-class organisations.  The total number of phratry names, thirty-three pairs in all, does not  of course fall solely to the count of the two-phratry tribes, but is  divided between the three kinds of organisation, the two-phratry having  twelve pairs with one anomalous area, the four-class sixteen, and the  eight-class five such sets. As regards the relative size of the areas  thus organised, the largest seems to be that occupied by the  Matteri-Kiraru system, though the Muquara-Kilpara (5) probably runs it  close, especially if we take into account the names of like meaning  (1-4) in the East Victorian area. The remainder of the two-phratry  systems do not range over a wide extent of country, so far as is known;  but 10, 11, and 33 are of unknown extent.    In the four-class area are two extensive systems, ranking next after  those of South Australia and N.S. Wales; these are Mallera-Wuthera (27)  and Pakoota-Wootaro (29); they have a single phratry name in common,  which is also found in two other systems; if we add these together, as  we may perhaps do on this evidence of a common basis, we have by far the  largest phratric system in Australia as the result. Almost equal in  extent to either of the two areas occupied by 27 and 29 is that claimed  by the better known Kamilaroi system--Dilbi-Kupathin, which spreads over  a long, comparatively narrow region, but had possibly at one time a  wider field from which at the present time only the corresponding class  names can be recovered. Of the remaining thirteen in the two-class  region, only 28, one of the Wuthera systems already mentioned, has more  than a restricted field of influence. Of moderate size are the four  areas in the eight-class system proper, that of the Mara being small in  comparison.    Taking now the native names, we find that, in addition to the Wuthera  (Ootaroo) sets already mentioned, the Dieri and Kurnandaburi have  Matteri (Mattera) in common, while the latter have in the Baddieri tribe  a neighbour which shares the Yungo phratry name with them. The fact, if  correct, that with the Badieri Yungo is associated with Wutheru, and  takes the place of the more usual Yungaru, suggests that we may equate  the latter with Yungo. In the eight-class area Uluuru is common to two  systems, while a third has Wiliuku, and the fourth Illitchi, all of  which seem to be allied, if we may take it that uru, uku, and tchi are  suffixes; that they are is borne out by the corresponding names  Liaritchi and Liaraku. Other possible equations are Mukula--Mukumurra,  and Cheepa--Koocheebinga, but in the latter case, even if koo is a  prefix, the distance of the two systems makes any such correspondence  improbable. In Victoria the Malian-Multa equation is indisputable; it is  interesting to note that the former is found in N.S. Wales as the name  of the bird, while Multa belongs to Yorke Peninsula.    As regards the meaning of these names, we find that of the fifty-eight  names which remain after deducting those which occur in more than one  system, nineteen can be translated with certainty, and we can guess at  the meaning of some half dozen more. Of translateable names the most  widely spread are various titles of Eaglehawk and Crow, which appear in  five different systems in Victoria and New South Wales[100]. Crow  reappears in West Australia under the name of Wartung, with white  cockatoo, also a Victorian phratry name, as its fellow. In North  Queensland, as a parallel to the black and white cockatoo of the south,  we find on the Annan River two species of bee giving their names to  phratries; and the Black Duck phratry of the Waradjeri suggests that  here too might be found another contrasting pair, if we could translate  the other name. For the Euahlayi phratry names, on which more will be  said in discussing the \"blood\" organisations, Mrs Parker gives the  translation \"Light-blooded\" and \"Dark-blooded,\" which comes near that  suggested by Mr Mathews--slow and quick blooded. In the Ulu, Illi, and  Wili of Northern Territory we seem to recognise Welu (curlew). Koolpuru  (emu), Yungaru and Yungo (kangaroo), and Wutheroo (emu) are also  possible meanings.    The problems raised by the phratriac nomenclature are complex and  probably insoluble. They are in part bound up with the problem of the  origin of the organisation itself; of this nature, for example, is the  question whether the names correspond to anything existing in the  pre-phratriac stage, or whether the organisation was borrowed and the  names taken over translated or untranslated into the idiom of the  borrowers. If the latter be the solution, we have a simple explanation  of the wide-spread Eaglehawk-Crow system as well as of other facts, to  which reference is made below.    If on the other hand the names have not been much spread by  borrowing,--and the increasing number of small phratry areas known to us  tells in favour of this, though it also suggests that the widely-found  systems have gained ground at the expense of their neighbours,--then we  obviously need some theory as to the origin of the organisation, before  we can frame any hypothesis as to the origin of the names.    The prominent part, however, played by the Eaglehawk among phratry names  raises some questions which can be discussed on their merits. One of  these is the age of phratry names. Some of the earliest records of  initiation ceremonies in New South Wales mention that the eaglehawk  figured in them[101]. In West Australia this bird is the demiurge, and  the progenitors of the phratries, of which crow is one, are his nephews.  This is not the only case in which these birds figure in mythology.    As the Rev. John Mathew has pointed out in his work, _Eaglehawk and  Crow_, there are found in Australia, especially in the south-eastern  portion, a number of myths relating to the conflicts of these birds.  These myths he interprets as echoes of a long-past conflict between the  aboriginal Negrito race and the invading Papuans, and traces the origin  of the phratries to the same racial strife. As an explanation of exogamy  the hypothesis is clearly insufficient, but it is evident that no theory  of the origin of the phratries can leave exogamy out of the question.  The point, however, with which we are immediately concerned is the myth  on which in the main Mr Mathew based his theory. Unfortunately, he did  not think it necessary to attempt to define either the area covered by  the different phratry names--an omission which is remedied by the  present work--nor yet the limits within which the myth in question or  its analogues are part of the native mythology. These analogues to the  story of the battle of Eaglehawk and Crow, ended in the Darling area  according to tradition by a treaty between the contending birds, are  myths in which birds are said to have destroyed the human race, or a  large portion of it, to have contended with Baiame, or one of the other  gods, or to have figured in some other conflict[102]. The bird of this  myth--the bird conflict myth, as it may be termed--is the Eaglehawk.  Possibly, as I have pointed out in the note in _Man_, both bird conflict  myths and Eaglehawk-Crow myths--they may be termed collectively bird  myths--may go back to a common origin. So far as Mr Mathew's evidence  goes, bird myths do not seem to be told outside the colony of Victoria  and the Darling area of New South Wales.    A little research, however, shows that this idea is altogether  erroneous. There are unfortunately large areas in Australia, as to the  mythology of which we know absolutely nothing. Therefore it must not be  supposed that the bird conflict myth is confined to the districts in  which we have evidence of its existence. We may rather infer that a myth  so widely distributed--it ranges from the head of the Bight, 129 deg. E., to  the coast north of Sydney, and probably as far as Moreton Bay; to the  north it is found among the Urabunna, and probably elsewhere--is common  property of the Australian Tribes.    A glance at the map will show that the eaglehawk and crow myth covers  but a small portion of the area in which the bird conflict myth is  found. On the other hand we find within the eaglehawk-crow myth district  the phratry names Cockatoo, three names of unknown meaning, and the  doubtful Kiraru--Kirarawa. Now if a racial conflict is indicated by the  names eaglehawk and crow, this must be either because the contending  races were already known by these names, or because the two birds in  question are proverbially hostile to each other. In either case we are  left without any explanation of the two cockatoo phratries. It may  indeed be argued that the locality in which the eaglehawk-crow phratry  names are found tells strongly in favour of the racial conflict  hypothesis; for it is precisely in this area that the last stand of the  aborigines against the invaders may, on the theory put forward by Mr  Mathew and accepted by some anthropologists[103], be supposed to have  taken place. But against this must be set the fact that in this area  also we find two cockatoos, and on the Annan River two bees, arrayed  against one another; unless it can be shown that these two birds are  also proverbial foes, or that the Australian native had reached a point  in his biological investigations at which he recognised that the  presence of two closely allied species in a district involves a  particularly keen struggle for existence (which they would, however,  regard in such an advanced stage of knowledge as appropriate to the  designation of intra-racial rather than inter-racial feuds), the two  sets of facts balance one another, and leave us still engaged in a vain  quest for a conclusion.    Putting theories as to racial conflicts aside, "]]]
