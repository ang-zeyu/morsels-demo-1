[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],[0,"The Kit√°b-i-Aqdas (#14)"],[1,"by aught that hath been  recorded in the Book from hearkening unto this, the Living Book, Who  proclaimeth the truth: \"Verily, there is no God but Me, the Most  Excellent, the All-Praised.\" Look ye with the eye of equity upon Him Who  hath descended from the heaven of Divine will and power, and be not of  those who act unjustly.    135 Call then to mind these words which have streamed forth, in tribute to  this Revelation, from the Pen of Him Who was My Herald, and consider what  the hands of the oppressors have wrought throughout My days. Truly they  are numbered with the lost. He said: \"Should ye attain the presence of Him  Whom We shall make manifest, beseech ye God, in His bounty, to grant that  He might deign to seat Himself upon your couches, for that act in itself  would confer upon you matchless and surpassing honour. Should He drink a  cup of water in your homes, this would be of greater consequence for you  than your proffering unto every soul, nay unto every created thing, the  water of its very life. Know this, O ye My servants!\"    136 Such are the words with which My Forerunner hath extolled My Being,  could ye but understand. Whoso reflecteth upon these verses, and realizeth  what hidden pearls have been enshrined within them, will, by the  righteousness of God, perceive the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafting  from the direction of this Prison and will, with his whole heart, hasten  unto Him with such ardent longing that the hosts of earth and heaven would  be powerless to deter him. Say: This is a Revelation around which every  proof and testimony doth circle. Thus hath it been sent down by your Lord,  the God of Mercy, if ye be of them that judge aright. Say: This is the  very soul of all Scriptures which hath been breathed into the Pen of the  Most High, causing all created beings to be dumbfounded, save only those  who have been enraptured by the gentle breezes of My loving-kindness and  the sweet savours of My bounties which have pervaded the whole of  creation.    137 O people of the Bayan! Fear ye the Most Merciful and consider what He  hath revealed in another passage. He said: \"The Qiblih is indeed He Whom  God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come  to rest.\" Thus was it set down by the Supreme Ordainer when He desired to  make mention of this Most Great Beauty. Meditate on this, O people, and be  not of them that wander distraught in the wilderness of error. If ye  reject Him at the bidding of your idle fancies, where then is the Qiblih  to which ye will turn, O assemblage of the heedless? Ponder ye this verse,  and judge equitably before God, that haply ye may glean the pearls of  mysteries from the ocean that surgeth in My Name, the All-Glorious, the  Most High.    138 Let none, in this Day, hold fast to aught save that which hath been  manifested in this Revelation. Such is the decree of God, aforetime and  hereafter--a decree wherewith the Scriptures of the Messengers of old have  been adorned. Such is the admonition of the Lord, aforetime and  hereafter--an admonition wherewith the preamble to the Book of Life hath  been embellished, did ye but perceive it. Such is the commandment of the  Lord, aforetime and hereafter; beware lest ye choose instead the part of  ignominy and abasement. Naught shall avail you in this Day but God, nor is  there any refuge to flee to save Him, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Whoso  hath known Me hath known the Goal of all desire, and whoso hath turned  unto Me hath turned unto the Object of all adoration. Thus hath it been  set forth in the Book, and thus hath it been decreed by God, the Lord of  all worlds. To read but one of the verses of My Revelation is better than  to peruse the Scriptures of both the former and latter generations. This  is the Utterance of the All-Merciful, would that ye had ears to hear! Say:  This is the essence of knowledge, did ye but understand.    139 And now consider what hath been revealed in yet another passage, that  perchance ye may forsake your own concepts and set your faces towards God,  the Lord of being. He(4) hath said: \"It is unlawful to enter into marriage  save with a believer in the Bayan. Should only one party to a marriage  embrace this Cause, his or her possessions will become unlawful to the  other, until such time as the latter hath converted. This law, however,  will only take effect after the exaltation of the Cause of Him Whom We  shall manifest in truth, or of that which hath already been made manifest  in justice. Ere this, ye are at liberty to enter into wedlock as ye wish,  that haply by this means ye may exalt the Cause of God.\" Thus hath the  Nightingale sung with sweet melody upon the celestial bough, in praise of  its Lord, the All-Merciful. Well is it with them that hearken.    140 O people of the Bayan, I adjure you by your Lord, the God of mercy, to  look with the eye of fairness upon this utterance which hath been sent  down through the power of truth, and not to be of those who see the  testimony of God yet reject and deny it. They, in truth, are of those who  will assuredly perish. The Point of the Bayan hath explicitly made mention  in this verse of the exaltation of My Cause before His own Cause; unto  this will testify every just and understanding mind. As ye can readily  witness in this day, its exaltation is such as none can deny save those  whose eyes are drunken in this mortal life and whom a humiliating  chastisement awaiteth in the life to come.    141 Say: By the righteousness of God! I, verily, am His(5) Best-Beloved;  and at this moment He listeneth to these verses descending from the Heaven  of Revelation and bewaileth the wrongs ye have committed in these days.  Fear God, and join not with the aggressor. Say: O people, should ye choose  to disbelieve in Him,(6) refrain at least from rising up against Him. By  God! Sufficient are the hosts of tyranny that are leagued against Him!    142 Verily, He(7) revealed certain laws so that, in this Dispensation, the  Pen of the Most High might have no need to move in aught but the  glorification of His own transcendent Station and His most effulgent  Beauty. Since, however, We have wished to evidence Our bounty unto you, We  have, through the power of truth, set forth these laws with clarity and  mitigated what We desire you to observe. He, verily, is the Munificent,  the Generous.    143 He(8) hath previously made known unto you that which would be uttered  by this Dayspring of Divine wisdom. He said, and He speaketh the truth:  \"He(9) is the One Who will under all conditions proclaim: 'Verily, there  is none other God besides Me, the One, the Incomparable, the Omniscient,  the All-Informed.'\" This is a station which God hath assigned exclusively  to this sublime, this unique and wondrous Revelation. This is a token of  His bounteous favour, if ye be of them who comprehend, and a sign of His  irresistible decree. This is His Most Great Name, His Most Exalted Word,  and the Dayspring of His Most Excellent Titles, if ye could understand.  Nay more, through Him every Fountainhead, every Dawning-place of Divine  guidance is made manifest. Reflect, O people, on that which hath been sent  down in truth; ponder thereon, and be not of the transgressors.    144 Consort with all religions with amity and concord, that they may  inhale from you the sweet fragrance of God. Beware lest amidst men the  flame of foolish ignorance overpower you. All things proceed from God and  unto Him they return. He is the source of all things and in Him all things  are ended.    145 Take heed that ye enter no house in the absence of its owner, except  with his permission. Comport yourselves with propriety under all  conditions, and be not numbered with the wayward.    146 It hath been enjoined upon you to purify your means of sustenance and  other such things through payment of Zakat. Thus hath it been prescribed  in this exalted Tablet by Him Who is the Revealer of verses. We shall, if  it be God's will and purpose, set forth erelong the measure of its  assessment. He, verily, expoundeth whatsoever He desireth by virtue of His  own knowledge, and He, of a truth, is Omniscient and All-Wise.    147 It is unlawful to beg, and it is forbidden to give to him who beggeth.  All have been enjoined to earn a living, and as for those who are  incapable of doing so, it is incumbent on the Deputies of God and on the  wealthy to make adequate provision for them. Keep ye the statutes and  commandments of God; nay, guard them as ye would your very eyes, and be  not of those who suffer grievous loss.    148 Ye have been forbidden in the Book of God to engage in contention and  conflict, to strike another, or to commit similar acts whereby hearts and  souls may be saddened. A fine of nineteen mit{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}h{~COMBINING MACRON BELOW~}qals of gold had formerly  been prescribed by Him Who is the Lord of all mankind for anyone who was  the cause of sadness to another; in this Dispensation, however, He hath  absolved you thereof and exhorteth you to show forth righteousness and  piety. Such is the commandment which He hath enjoined upon you in this  resplendent Tablet. Wish not for others what ye wish not for yourselves;  fear God, and be not of the prideful. Ye are all created out of water, and  unto dust shall ye return. Reflect upon the end that awaiteth you, and  walk not in the ways of the oppressor. Give ear unto the verses of God  which He Who is the sacred Lote-Tree reciteth unto you. They are assuredly  the infallible balance, established by God, the Lord of this world and the  next. Through them the soul of man is caused to wing its flight towards  the Dayspring of Revelation, and the heart of every true believer is  suffused with light.

But at that time the reliance on the fidelity of  the Native troops was unbounded, and officers believed implicitly in  the contentment and loyalty of their men. Their faith in them was  extraordinary. Even after half the Native army had mutinied and many  officers had been murdered, those belonging to the remaining regiments  could not believe that their own particular men could be guilty of  treachery.    At Peshawar there was not the slightest suspicion of the extent to  which the evil had spread, and we were quite thunderstruck when, on  the evening of the 11th May, as we were sitting at mess, the telegraph  signaller rushed in breathless with excitement, a telegram in his  hand, which proved to be a message from Delhi 'to all stations in the  Punjab,' conveying the startling intelligence that a very serious  outbreak had occurred at Meerut the previous evening, that some of  the troopers from there had already reached Delhi, that the Native  soldiers at the latter place had joined the mutineers, and that many  officers and residents at both stations had been killed.    Lieutenant-Colonel Davidson, commanding the 16th Irregular Cavalry,  who happened to be dining at mess that evening, was the first to  recover from the state of consternation into which we were thrown  by the reading of this telegram. He told us it was of the utmost  importance that the Commissioner and the General should at once be put  in possession of this astounding news, and at the same time impressed  upon us the imperative necessity for keeping it secret.    Davidson then hurried off to the Commissioner, who with his deputy,  Nicholson, lived within a stone's-throw of the mess. Edwardes drove at  once to the General's house, while Nicholson came to our mess. He too  pointed out to us the importance of preventing the news from getting  about and of keeping it as long as possible from the Native soldiers.    We had at Peshawar three regiments of Native Cavalry and five of  Native Infantry, not less than 5,000 men, while the strength of the  two British regiments and the Artillery did not exceed 2,000. This  European force was more than sufficient to cope with the eight Native  corps, but in the event of any general disturbance amongst the Native  troops, we had to calculate on the probability of their being joined  by the 50,000 inhabitants of the city, and, indeed, by the entire  population of the Peshawar valley; not to speak of the tribes all  along the border, who were sure to rise.    It was an occasion for the gravest anxiety, and the delay of even a  few hours in the sepoys becoming aware of the disastrous occurrences  at Meerut and Delhi meant a great deal to us.    Fortunately for India, there were good men and true at Peshawar in  those days, when hesitation and irresolution would have been  fatal, and it is worthy of note that they were comparatively young  men--Edwardes was thirty-seven, Nicholson thirty-five; Neville  Chamberlain, the distinguished Commandant of the Punjab Frontier Force  (who was hastily summoned from Kohat, where he happened to be on his  tour of inspection), was thirty-seven; and the Brigadier, Sydney  Cotton, though much older, being sixty-five, was not only  exceptionally young for his years and full of energy and intelligence,  but actually much younger than the average of General officers  commanding stations in India.    At once, on hearing of the Mutiny, Edwardes, acting in unison with  Nicholson, sent to the post-office and laid hands on all Native  correspondence; the letters they thus secured showed but too plainly  how necessary was this precaution. The number of seditious papers  seized was alarmingly great; they were for the most part couched in  figurative and enigmatical language, but it was quite sufficiently  clear from them that every Native regiment in the garrison was more or  less implicated and prepared to join the rebel movement.    A strong interest attaches to these letters, for they brought to light  the true feeling of the Natives towards us at the time, and it was  evident from them that the sepoys had really been made to believe that  we intended to destroy their caste by various unholy devices, of  which the issue of contaminating cartridges was one. The seeds of  disaffection had been sown by agitators, who thought they saw an  opportunity for realizing their hope of overthrowing our rule,  maintained as it was by a mere handful of Europeans in the midst of a  vast population of Asiatics. This feeling of antagonism, only guessed  at before, was plainly revealed in these letters, never intended to  meet the European eye. Some corps did not appear to be quite so guilty  as others, but there could now be no doubt that all were tainted with  disloyalty, and that none of the Hindustani troops could any longer be  trusted.    In the afternoon of Tuesday, the 12th May, I received a note from the  General commanding the division directing me to present myself at his  house the following morning, which I accordingly did. Besides General  Reed I found there the Brigadier, Sydney Cotton; the Commissioner,  Herbert Edwardes; the Deputy Commissioner, John Nicholson;  Brigadier Neville Chamberlain, and Captain Wright, Deputy  Assistant-Adjutant-General, who, like myself, had been summoned to  record the decisions that might be arrived at.    This meeting was a most momentous one, and I remember being greatly  impressed with the calm and comprehensive view of the situation taken  by Edwardes and Nicholson. They had already been in communication with  the Chief Commissioner, and had, previous to the meeting, received a  telegram from him approving generally of the several proposals they  contemplated. John Lawrence also informed them that the authorities  at Lahore had decided on disarming the Native troops at Mian Mir that  very morning.    The problem to be solved was how the Punjab could best be made secure  with the small force of British troops available--all told not more  than 15,000, with 84 guns--against upwards of 65,000 Natives (of whom  42,000 were Hindustanis), with 62 guns.[3] In all stations Native  troops preponderated, and in some there were no European soldiers at  all.    Edwardes and Nicholson gave it as their opinion that the only chance  of keeping the Punjab and the frontier quiet lay in trusting the  Chiefs and people, and in endeavouring to induce them to side with us  against the Hindustanis. They undertook to communicate, regarding  the raising of levies and fresh troops, with their friends and  acquaintances along the border, who had proved such staunch allies in  1848-49, when we were fighting with the Sikhs. How nobly these loyal  men responded to the demand made upon them, and how splendidly the  frontier and Punjab soldiers whom they brought to our assistance  behaved, will be seen hereafter.    Amongst other matters of importance, it was proposed by those two able  soldier-civilians, Edwardes and Nicholson, that General Reed, as the  senior officer in the Punjab, should join the Chief Commissioner at  Rawal Pindi, leaving Brigadier Cotton in command at Peshawar; that a  Movable Column, composed of reliable troops, should be organized  at some convenient place in the Punjab,[4] prepared to move in any  direction where its services might be required; that the Hindustani  regiments should be scattered as much as possible, in order to prevent  dangerous combinations; that a detachment of Punjab Infantry from  Kohat should replace the Hindustani sepoys in the fort of Attock,  which was a very important position, as it contained a magazine, and  covered the passage of the Indus; and that a small guard of Pathan  levies, under a tried and trusty frontier Native officer, should be  placed in charge of the Attock ferry.    All these proposals were cordially and unanimously agreed to by the  military authorities present.    The question of the command of the Movable Column was then discussed.  It was considered essential that the officer selected should, in  addition to other necessary qualifications, have considerable  experience of the country, and an intimate knowledge of Native  soldiers. It was no ordinary command. On the action of the Movable  Column would depend, to a great extent, the maintenance of peace and  order throughout the Punjab, and it was felt that, at such a crisis,  the best man must be selected, irrespective of seniority. It was a  position for which Cotton and Nicholson would have given much, and for  which they were well qualified, but there was important work for them  to do at Peshawar. Neville Chamberlain was available, and there was  a general consensus of opinion that he should be appointed. It was  necessary, however, to refer the matter to the Chief Commissioner,  with a request that he would submit it for the orders of the  Commander-in-Chief. This course was adopted, and in a few hours a  reply was received from General Anson nominating Chamberlain to the  command. My anxiety as to the Commander-in-Chief's decision was very  considerable; for Brigadier Chamberlain, to my infinite delight and  astonishment, had offered, in the event of his being appointed, to  take me with him as his staff officer--the most wonderful piece of  good fortune that could have come to me; my readers must imagine  my feelings, for it is impossible for me to describe them. My most  sanguine hopes seemed about to be more than realized; for though the  serious aspect of affairs seemed to promise the chance of active  service, I little thought that I should be lucky enough to be employed  as the staff officer of such a distinguished soldier as Neville  Chamberlain.    When the meeting was over I was ordered to take the several messages,  which Wright and I had written out, to the telegraph office, and see  them despatched myself; as they disclosed more or less the"]]]
