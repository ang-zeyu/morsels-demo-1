Glorified, glorified be Thine unattainable loftiness. Glorified, glorified  be the preeminence of Thy kingship and the sublimity of Thine authority  and power.    The highest faculties which the learned have possessed, and whatsoever  truths they, in their search after the gems of Thy knowledge, have  discovered; the brightest realities with which the wise have been endowed,  and whatever secrets they, in their attempts to fathom the mysteries of  Thy wisdom, have unraveled, have all been created through the generative  power of the Spirit that was breathed into the Pen which Thy hands have  fashioned. How, then, can the thing which Thy Pen hath created be capable  of comprehending those treasures of Thy Faith with which, as decreed by  Thee, that Pen hath been invested? How can it ever know of the Fingers  that grasp Thy Pen, and of Thy merciful favors with which it hath been  endowed? How can it, already unable to reach this station, be made aware  of the existence of Thy Hand that controlleth the Fingers of Thy might?  How can it attain unto the comprehension of the nature of Thy Will that  animateth the movement of Thy Hand?    Glorified, glorified be Thou, O my God! How can I ever hope to ascend into  the heaven of Thy most holy will, or gain admittance into the tabernacle  of Thy Divine knowledge, knowing as I do that the minds of the wise and  learned are impotent to fathom the secrets of Thy handiwork--a handiwork  which is itself but a creation of Thy will?    Praise be to Thee, O Lord, my God, my Master, my Possessor, my King. Now  that I have confessed unto Thee my powerlessness and the powerlessness of  all created things, and have acknowledged my poverty and the poverty of  the entire creation, I call unto Thee with my tongue and the tongues of  all that are in heaven and on earth, and beseech Thee with my heart and  the hearts of all that have entered beneath the shadow of Thy names and  Thine attributes, not to shut us from the doors of Thy loving-kindness and  grace, nor to suffer the breeze of Thy bountiful care and favor to cease  from being wafted over our souls, nor to permit that our hearts be  occupied with any one except Thee, or our minds to be busied with any  remembrance save remembrance of Thy Self.    By the glory of Thy might, O my God! Wert Thou to set me king over Thy  realms, and to establish me upon the throne of Thy sovereignty, and to  deliver, through Thy power, the reins of the entire creation into my  hands, and wert Thou to cause me, though it be for less than a moment, to  be occupied with these things and be oblivious of the wondrous memories  associated with Thy most mighty, most perfect, and most exalted Name, my  soul would still remain unsatisfied, and the pangs of my heart unstilled.  Nay, I would, in that very state, recognize myself as the poorest of the  poor, and the most wretched of the wretched.    Magnified be Thy name, O my God! Now that Thou hast caused me to apprehend  this truth, I beseech Thee by Thy Name which no scroll can bear, which no  heart can imagine and no tongue can utter--a Name which will remain  concealed so long as Thine own Essence is hidden, and will be glorified so  long as Thine own Being is extolled--to unfurl, ere the present year draw  to a close, the ensigns of Thine undisputed ascendancy and triumph, that  the whole creation may be enriched by Thy wealth, and may be exalted  through the ennobling influence of Thy transcendent sovereignty, and that  all may arise and promote Thy Cause.    Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the All-Highest, the All-Glorious, the  All-Subduing, the All-Possessing.            LIX: \"ALL PRAISE, O MY GOD, BE TO THEE WHO ART THE...\"      All praise, O my God, be to Thee Who art the Source of all glory and  majesty, of greatness and honor, of sovereignty and dominion, of loftiness  and grace, of awe and power. Whomsoever Thou willest Thou causest to draw  nigh unto the Most Great Ocean, and on whomsoever Thou desirest Thou  conferrest the honor of recognizing Thy Most Ancient Name. Of all who are  in heaven and on earth, none can withstand the operation of Thy sovereign  Will. From all eternity Thou didst rule the entire creation, and Thou wilt  continue for evermore to exercise Thy dominion over all created things.  There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the  All-Powerful, the All-Wise.    Illumine, O Lord, the faces of Thy servants, that they may behold Thee;  and cleanse their hearts that they may turn unto the court of Thy heavenly  favors, and recognize Him Who is the Manifestation of Thy Self and the  Day-Spring of Thine Essence. Verily, Thou art the Lord of all worlds.  There is no God but Thee, the Unconstrained, the All-Subduing.            LX: \"GLORIFIED BE THOU, O MY GOD! BEHOLD THOU MY...\"      Glorified be Thou, O my God! Behold Thou my head ready to fall before the  sword of Thy Will, my neck prepared to bear the chains of Thy Desire, my  heart yearning to be made a target for the darts of Thy Decree, mine eyes  expectant to gaze on the tokens and signs of Thy wondrous Mercy. For  whatsoever may befall me from Thee is the cherished desire of them who  thirst to meet Thee, and the supreme aspiration of such as have drawn nigh  unto Thy court.    By the glory of Thy might, O Thou my Well-Beloved! To have sacrificed my  life for the Manifestations of Thy Self, to have offered up my soul in the  path of the Revealers of Thy wondrous Beauty, is to have sacrificed my  spirit for Thy Spirit, my being for Thy Being, my glory for Thy glory. It  is as if I had offered up all these things for Thy sake, and for the sake  of Thy loved ones.    Though my body be pained by the trials that befall me from Thee, though it  be afflicted by the revelations of Thy Decree, yet my soul rejoiceth at  having partaken of the waters of Thy Beauty, and at having attained the  shores of the ocean of Thine eternity. Doth it beseem a lover to flee from  his beloved, or to desert the object of his heart's desire? Nay, we all  believe in Thee, and eagerly hope to enter Thy presence.            LXI: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! THOU DOST...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! Thou dost witness that Thy will hath  prevailed over all created things, and Thy mercy hath surpassed all who  are in heaven and on earth. And when Thou didst purpose to unveil Thy  sovereignty, and to glorify Thy word, and to reveal Thy bounteousness and  mercy, Thou didst raise up one of Thy servants, and didst choose Him above  all Thy creatures, and didst single Him out for Thy purpose, and didst  clothe Him with the robe of Thy guidance, and didst immerse Him beneath  the seas of Thy majesty and grandeur, and didst sanctify Him from all that  beseemeth not the greatness of Thy glory and the power of Thy might, and  didst bid Him to cry out before all that are in heaven and on earth, and  summon the multitudes to the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Revealer of  Thy signs.    No sooner had He proclaimed Thy Cause, and risen up to carry out the  things prescribed unto Him in the Tablets of Thy decree, than the Great  Terror fell upon Thy creatures. Some turned towards Thee, and detached  themselves from all except Thee, and sanctified their souls from the world  and all that is therein, and were so enravished by the sweetness of Thy  voice that they forsook all Thou hadst created in the kingdom of Thy  creation. Others recognized Thee and then hesitated, others allowed the  world to come in between them and Thee and to withhold them from  recognizing Thee. Others disdained Thee, and turned back from Thee, and  wished to prevent Thee from achieving Thy purpose. And yet behold how all  of them are calling upon Thee, and are expecting the things they were  promised in Thy Tablets. And when the Promised One came unto them, they  recognized Him not, and disbelieved in Thy signs, and repudiated Thy clear  tokens, and strayed so grievously from Thy path that they slew Thy  servants, through the brightness of whose faces the countenances of the  Concourse on high have been illumined.    I beseech Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names, to guard Thy loved  ones against Thine enemies, and to strengthen them in their love for Thee  and in fulfilling Thy pleasure. Do Thou protect them, that their footsteps  may slip not, that their hearts may not be shut out as by a veil from  Thee, and that their eyes may be restrained from beholding anything that  is not of Thee. Cause them to be so enraptured by the sweetness of Thy  divine melodies that they will rid themselves of all attachment to any one  except Thee, and will turn wholly towards Thee, and extol Thee under all  conditions, saying: \"Praised be Thou, O Lord our God, inasmuch as Thou  hast enabled us to recognize Thy most exalted and all-glorious Self. We  will, by Thy mercy, cleave to Thee, and will detach ourselves from any one  but Thee. We have realized that Thou art the Beloved of the worlds and the  Creator of earth and heaven!\"    Glorified be God, the Lord of all creation!            LXII: \"LAUDED AND GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD!...\"      Lauded and glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Thou art He Who from  everlasting hath been clothed with majesty, with authority and power, and  will continue unto everlasting to be arrayed with honor, with strength and  glory. The learned, one and all, stand aghast before the signs and tokens  of Thy handiwork, while the wise find themselves, without exception,  impotent to unravel the mystery of Them Who are the Manifestations of Thy  might and power. Every man of insight hath confessed his powerlessness to  scale the heights of Thy knowledge, and every man of learning hath  acknowledged his failure to fathom the nature of Thine Essence.

They       wrote out in every tongue the holy Gospel, and the story and       teaching of Christ, at the dictation of the Holy Ghost. So the       nations drew near unto them, believing their testimony; and, giving       up the world and their false beliefs, they embraced the Christian       faith as soon as ever the dawn of truth and the light of the good       tidings broke in upon them. Distinguishing the true from the false,       and error from the right direction, they embraced the Gospel and       held it fast without doubt or wavering, when they saw the wonderful       works and signs of the apostles, and their lives and conversation       set after the holy and beautiful example of our Saviour, the traces       whereof remain even unto the present day.... How different this       from the life of thy Master (Mohammed) and his companions, who       ceased not to go forth in battle and rapine, to smite with the       sword, to seize the little ones, and ravish the wives and maidens,       plundering and laying waste, and carrying the people into       captivity. And thus they continue unto this present day, inciting       men to these evil deeds, even as it is told of Omar the Caliph. \"If       one among you,\" said he, \"hath a heathen neighbor and is in need,       let him seize and sell him.\" And many such things they say and       teach. Look now at the lives of Simon and Paul, who went about       healing the sick and raising the dead, by the name of Christ our       Lord; and mark the contrast.[58]    [Sidenote: Such are the conclusions of a native of Chaldea.]  Such are the reflections of one who lived at a Mohammedan court, and  who, moreover, flourishing as he did a thousand years ago, was  sufficiently near the early spread of Islam to be able to contrast what  he saw and heard and read of the causes of its success with those of the  Gospel, and had the courage to confess the same.    [Sidenote: Hinderances or inducements inherent in the faith itself.]  Apart, now, from the outward and extraneous aids given to Islam by the  sword and by the civil arm I will inquire for a moment what natural  effect the teaching of Islam itself had in attracting or repelling  mankind. I do not now speak of any power contained in the truths it  inculcated to convert to Islam by the rousing and quickening of  spiritual impulses; for that lies beyond my present purpose, which is to  inquire whether there is not in material causes and secular motives  enough in themselves to account for success. I speak rather of the  effect of the indulgences granted by Islam, on the one hand, as  calculated to attract; and of the restraints imposed and sacrifices  required, on the other, as calculated to repel. How far, in fact, did  there exist inducements or hinderances to its adoption inherent in the  religion itself?    [Sidenote: Requirements of Islam: prayer.  Prohibition of wine, games of chance, and usury.  Fast of Ramzan.]  What may be regarded as the most constant and irksome of the obligations  of Islam is the duty of prayer, which must be observed at stated  intervals, five times every day, with the contingent ceremony of  lustration. The rite consists of certain forms and passages to be  repeated with prescribed series of prostrations and genuflexions. These  must be repeated at the right times--but anywhere, in the house or by  the wayside, as well as in the mosque; and the ordinance is obligatory  in whatever state of mind the worshiper may be, or however occupied. As  the appointed hour comes round the Moslem is bound to turn aside to  pray--so much so that in Central Asia we read of the police driving the  backward worshiper by the lash to discharge the duty. Thus, with the  mass of Mussulmans, the obligation becomes a mere formal ceremony, and  one sees it performed anywhere and every-where by the whole people, like  any social custom, as a matter of course. No doubt there are exceptions;  but with the multitude it does not involve the irksomeness of a  spiritual service, and so it sits lightly on high and low. The Friday  prayers should as a rule be attended in the mosque; but neither need  there be much devotion there; and, once performed, the rest of the day  is free for pleasure or for business.[59] The prohibition of wine is a  restriction which was severely felt in the early days of the faith; but  it was not long before the universal sentiment (though eluded in some  quarters) supported it. The embargo upon games of chance was certainly  unpopular; and the prohibition of the receipt of interest was also an  important limitation, tending as it did to shackle the freedom of  mercantile speculation; but they have been partially evaded on various  pretexts. The fast throughout the month of Ramzan was a severer test;  but even this lasts only during the day; and at night, from sunset till  dawn, all restrictions are withdrawn, not only in respect of food, but  of all otherwise lawful gratifications.[60]    [Sidenote: Little that is unpopular in these ordinances.]  There is nothing, therefore, in the requirements and ordinances of  Islam, excepting the fast, that is very irksome to humanity, or which,  as involving any material sacrifice, or the renunciation of the  pleasures or indulgences of life, should lead a man of the world to  hesitate in embracing the new faith.    [Sidenote: Indulgences allowed in the matter of wives and concubines.]  On the other hand, the license allowed by the Koran between the  sexes--at least in favor of the male sex--is so wide that for such as  have the means and the desire to take advantage of it there need be no  limit whatever to sexual indulgence. It is true that adultery is  punishable by death and fornication with stripes. But then the Koran  gives the believer permission to have four wives at a time. And he may  exchange them--that is, he may divorce them at pleasure, taking others  in their stead.[61] And, as if this were not license enough, the divine  law permits the believer to consort with all female slaves whom he may  be the master of--such, namely, as have been taken in war, or have been  acquired by gift or purchase. These he may receive into his harem  instead of wives, or in addition to them; and without any limit of  number or restraint whatever he is at liberty to cohabit with them.    [Sidenote: Polygamy, concubinage, and divorce. Practice at the rise of  Islam.]  A few instances taken at random will enable the reader to judge how the  indulgences thus allowed by the religion were taken advantage of in the  early days of Islam. In the great plague which devastated Syria seven  years after the prophet's death Khalid, the Sword of God, lost _forty_  sons. Abdal Rahman, one of the \"companions\" of Mohammed, had issue by  sixteen wives, not counting slave-girls.[62] Moghira ibn Shoba, another  \"companion,\" and governor of Kufa and Bussorah, had in his harem eighty  consorts, free and servile. Coming closer to the Prophet's household, we  find that Mohammed himself at one period had in his harem no fewer than  nine wives and two slave-girls. Of his grandson Hasan we read that his  vagrant passion gained for him the unenviable sobriquet of _The  Divorcer_; for it was only by continually divorcing his consorts that he  could harmonize his craving for fresh nuptials with the requirements of  the divine law, which limited the number of his free wives to four. We  are told that, as a matter of simple caprice, he exercised the power of  divorce seventy (according to other traditions ninety) times. When the  leading men complained to Aly of the licentious practice of his son his  only reply was that the remedy lay in their own hands, of refusing Hasan  their daughters altogether.[63] Such are the material inducements, the  \"works of the flesh,\" which Islam makes lawful to its votaries, and  which promoted thus its early spread.    [Sidenote: Practice in modern times.  The Malays of Penang.  Lane's testimony concerning Egypt.  The princess of Bhopal's account of Mecca.]  Descending now to modern times, we still find that this sexual license  is taken advantage of more or less in different countries and conditions  of society. The following examples are simply meant as showing to what  excess it is possible for the believer to carry these indulgences,  _under the sanction of his religion_. Of the Malays in Penang it was  written not very long ago: \"Young men of thirty to thirty-five years of  age may be met with who have had from fifteen to twenty wives, and  children by several of them. These women have been divorced, married  others, and had children by them.\" Regarding Egypt, Lane tells us: \"I  have heard of men who have been in the habit of marrying a new wife  almost every month.\"[64] Burkhardt speaks of an Arab forty-five years  old who had had fifty wives, \"so that he must have divorced two wives  and married two fresh ones on the average every year.\" And not to go  further than the sacred city of Mecca, the late reigning princess of  Bhopal, in central India, herself an orthodox follower of the Prophet,  after making the pilgrimage of the holy places, writes thus:         Women frequently contract as many as ten marriages, and those who       have only been married twice "]]]
