Also causes removed by appeal from a justice's court are tried  in this court; in which cases it is said to have _appellate_  jurisdiction. Courts are also said to have _original_ jurisdiction;  which means that suits may _originate_ or commence in such courts.    Sec.3. There is in every state at least one court, and in most of the  states there are two or more courts of higher grade than a county court.  They are called in the different states by different names; as _circuit  court_, _superior court_, _supreme court_, and _court of appeals_. A  _circuit_ court probably obtains its name thus: A state is divided into  judicial districts, in each of which one or more judges are elected,  who go around holding a court once a year or oftener in each of the  counties composing a judicial district. This court usually has both  original and appellate jurisdiction; it being a part of its business to  try appeals from the county courts. It also tries such of the higher  crimes as a county court has not the power to try. Courts in which  crimes are tried are sometimes called courts of _oyer and terminer_.    Sec.4. Every county court, and every circuit having like jurisdiction, has  a jury to try issues of fact, and a grand jury. An _issue of fact_ is  when the _fact_ as to the indebtedness or the guilt of the party charged  is to be determined from the testimony. An _issue of law_ is one in  which it is to be determined what is the _law_ in the case, which is  done by the judge instead of the jury. The jury by which issues of fact  are tried, as distinguished from a grand jury, is called a _petty_ or  _petit jury_. It consists of twelve men, all of whom must agree in a  verdict.    Sec.5. The manner of selecting grand and petit jurors is prescribed by law.  A number of judicious men in each town are selected by some person or  persons lawfully authorized; and the names of the men so selected are  written on separate pieces of paper, and put into a box in each town,  and kept by the town clerk; or as is the practice in some states, the  names of the men designated as jurors in the several towns are sent to  the county clerk, and by him kept in a box. Previous to the sitting of  the court, the requisite number is drawn out the box; and the men whose  names are drawn, are summoned to attend as jurors.    Sec.6. It is the business of a _grand jury_ to inquire concerning crimes  and misdemeanors committed in the county; and if there appear just  grounds of accusation against any person, they make to the court a  presentment or formal charge against him, upon which he is to be put  upon trial. The number of grand jurors is not always the same. In some  states there may not be more than twenty-three nor less than twelve. It  is not required that they shall all agree in order to put a person upon  trial.    Sec.7. On the opening of the court, the grand jurors are sworn to make a  true presentment of all things given them in charge. The judge then  gives them a charge, and appoints one of them foreman; and the jurors  retire to a private apartment to attend to their duties. They hear all  complaints brought before them against persons for crimes and breaches  of the peace, and examine witnesses who appear to testify; and when it  is requested, they have the assistance and advice of the state's  attorney; or as he is called in some states, the _district attorney_, or  _prosecuting attorney_. If they think any person complained of ought to  be tried, they draw up a writing, in which they charge him with the  offense of which they think him guilty. This is called an _indictment_.  It is signed by the foreman, indorsed \"a true bill,\" and carried by the  jury into court. If the person accused has not before been arrested, he  may now be arrested, and put upon trial. (See Chap. XVIII, Sec.12-14.)    Sec.8. As grand juries do not try crimes, but merely make inquiry into  them, some may not readily perceive the necessity of such juries.  Innocent persons might be subjected to great inconvenience and expense  in defending themselves in court against the slanderous reports or false  accusations of evil minded persons. It is to prevent this that grand  juries are instituted, who make careful examinations into the cases  brought before them, and do not often charge persons with crime unless  there is a strong probability of their being found guilty on trial.    Sec.9. So important was the institution of grand juries considered, that  the constitution of the United States, to which the constitutions and  laws of the states must conform, was made to provide, that \"no person  shall be held to answer for a capital or other infamous crime, unless on  a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,\" except in certain cases.  (Con. U.S., Amend. Art. V. For the definition of \"infamous crime,\" see  Chap. VI., Sec.7.)    Sec.10. It is the opinion of many that this requirement of a previous  indictment by a grand jury has reference only to the courts of the  United States; and that the states may dispense with it. Hence, efforts  are now making in some states to abolish grand juries. It is supposed  that an examination at all times before a justice or a judge, when the  prisoner can be present with his witnesses, is more likely to protect  him against being unnecessarily subjected to the trouble and expense of  a trial, than before a grand jury, where complaints are often made by  malicious persons, and sustained by the testimony of partial or corrupt  witnesses.    Sec.11. The _supreme court_ is generally the next higher, and in most of  the states, the highest state court. This court differs somewhat in the  different states, both in the manner of its formation and in its  jurisdiction. It is believed, however, to have, in the states generally,  both original and appellate jurisdiction, civil and criminal. In the  state of New York and a few other states, there is one higher court,  called _court of appeals_, which has appellate power only. Its business  is to review cases from the supreme court.    Sec.12. Suits in the county, circuit, and supreme courts, are commenced by  a _writ_, (in some states a summons or a declaration,) which is served  by the sheriff of the county in which the suit is to be tried. He also  serves warrants and executions issued by these courts. A sheriff is to  these courts what a constable is to a justice's court. His powers and  duties have been elsewhere described. (Chap. XIV., Sec.8.)          Chapter XX.    Chancery or Equity Courts; Probate Courts; Court of Impeachment.        Sec.1. It might be supposed, that in instituting the courts which have been  described, all necessary provision had been made for securing justice to  the citizens. But many cases arise in which justice and equity can not  be obtained in these courts. To afford relief in such cases, a court  has been established called a _court of equity_, or _court of chancery_.  What often renders it impossible to get justice in ordinary courts of  law, is the want of witnesses; but in a court of equity the parties may  themselves be put on oath.    Sec.2. A debtor, to avoid the payment of his debts, may conceal his  property or his money; but this court may compel him to disclose and  give up the same to satisfy an execution; and it may prevent persons  indebted to him from making payment to him. A person refusing to fulfill  a contract may, in courts of common law, only be sued for damage; but  this court may in certain cases compel him to fulfill the contract  itself. It may also restrain individuals and corporations from  committing fraudulent acts, and prevent persons from committing wastes  on land and certain other injuries, until the right at law can be tried.    Sec.3. Courts of chancery were established, it is believed, in a majority  of the old states. But separate and distinct organizations called  chancery courts, now exist in but a few states; the power to try suits  in equity having been given to the judges of the common law courts.    Sec.4. Suits _in equity_ are not commenced as suits _at law_. The plaintiff  prepares a bill of complaint, the facts stated in which are sworn to by  himself. The bill, which contains a petition or prayer that the  defendant may be summoned to make answer on oath, is filed with the  clerk of the court, who issues a subpoena commanding the defendant to  appear before the court on a day named. A trial may be had on the  complaint and answer alone; or witnesses may be introduced by the  parties. The case is argued by counsel, and a _decree_ is pronounced by  the court, which the court has power to carry into effect.    Sec.5. There is another kind of courts which are in their nature different  from ordinary law courts, and are called _probate courts_. There is in  every county a probate court held by a _judge of probate_, whose duties  relate to the proving of wills and the settling of the estates of  persons deceased. A _will_ is a writing in which a person gives  directions concerning the disposal of his property after his death. The  Latin word _probatus_ means proof; from which _probate_ has come to be  applied to the proving of a will. (See Wills and Testaments.) In the  state of New York the judge of this court is called _surrogate_, and the  court is called _surrogate's court_.    Sec.6. There is still another court in every state, which is not a common  law court. It is the _court of impeachment_. The name is applied to the  senate when sitting on a trial of impeachment. An _impeachment_ is a  charge or accusation against a public officer for corrupt conduct in his  office; as if a governor, for money offered him, should approve and sign  a law; or a judge should, for money or from some other selfish or  personal motive, give a wrong judgment. The constitution gives to the  house of representatives the power to impeach, and to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15323"],[0,"The Green Eyes of Bâst (#14)"],[1," I  rose to greet her that she was laboring under the influence of  dangerous nervous excitement.    \"You are worried about Eric?\" I said, when we had exchanged those  rather formal greetings in which I think we took mutual shelter.  Certainly I did, and later I was to know that Isobel did so, too.    \"Every day seems to make the case grow blacker against him,\" she  replied, sinking down upon the settee beside me.    And indeed the shadow which had fallen upon all of us seemed at that  moment almost palpable--a thing to be felt like the darkness of Egypt  and not to be dispelled even by the brightness of the morning.    \"When did you last see Coverly?\"    Isobel raised her head wearily.    \"Last night, and he seemed to think that some one was following him--a  detective.\"    I noticed that Isobel spoke of Eric Coverly with a certain manner of  restraint for which I could not account. Yet perhaps it was only  natural that she should do so, but at the time I was foolishly blind  to the opposing emotions which fought and conflicted within her.    \"He still refused to explain his movements on the night of the  murder?\" I asked.    \"Yes, he persisted in his extraordinary silence,\" said Isobel.    The look of trouble in her eyes grew more acute.    \"What I cannot understand is a sort of attitude of resentment which he  has lately adopted.\"    \"Of resentment? Towards whom?\"    \"Towards _me_.\"    \"But--\"    \"Oh, it's quite incomprehensible, Jack, and it is making me horribly  unhappy. He complained so bitterly too about this police surveillance  to which he is subjected. He realizes that the coroner is almost  certain to put a wrong construction on his silence, but instead of  being frank about it he adopts, even when alone with me, this  incomprehensible attitude of resentment. In fact his behavior almost  suggests that _I_ am responsible for his present misfortunes.\"    \"He must be mad,\" I said, and I expect I spoke bitterly, for Isobel  lowered her eyes and her face flushed with embarrassment.    \"Don't think that I condemn him,\" I added hastily, \"but really in  justice to you, if not in order to clear his own good name, he should  speak out at once. Are you expecting to see him to-day?\"    Isobel nodded.    \"I am expecting him at almost any moment,\" she replied; then glancing  aside at a number of daily papers which lay littered upon the floor  beside the settee: \"Of course you have seen what the press has to say  about it?\" she added.    I nodded.    \"What can you expect?\" said I. \"It is one of those cases in which  practically all the evidence, although it is of a purely  circumstantial nature, points to an innocent man as the culprit. I  feel very keenly annoyed with Coverly, for not only is he involving  both of you in a most unsavory case but he is also hindering the work  of justice. In fact by his inexplicable silence he is, although no  doubt unconsciously, affording the murderer time to elude the law.\"    Even as I spoke the words I heard a cab draw up in the street below,  and glancing out of the window, I saw Coverly alight from the cab, pay  the man and enter the doorway. His bearing was oddly furtive, that, as  I thought with a sudden pang, of a fugitive. A few moments later he  came into the room and his expression when he found me there was one  of marked hostility.    Eric Coverly bore no resemblance whatever to the deceased baronet from  whom he inherited the title, belonging as he did to quite another  branch of the family. Whereas Sir Marcus had been of a dark and sallow  type, Eric Coverly was one of those fair, fresh-colored, open-air  English types, handsome in an undistinguished way, and as a rule of a  light and careless disposition. There had never been any very close  sympathy between us, for the studies to which I devoted so much time  were by him regarded as frankly laughable absurdities. Although well  enough informed, he was typical of his class, and no one could justly  have catalogued him as an intellectual.    \"Good morning, Addison,\" he said, having greeted Isobel in a  perfunctory fashion which I assumed to be accounted for by my  unwelcome presence. \"The men of your Fleet Street tribe have conspired  to hang me, I see.\"    \"Don't talk nonsense, Coverly,\" I said bruskly; \"this misapprehension  is bound to arise if you decline to give any account of your  movements.\"    \"But it is an outrage!\" cried Coverly hotly. \"What the devil do _I_  know about Marcus's death?\"    \"I am perfectly convinced that you know nothing whatever; but then I  have known you for many years. The 'Fleet Street tribe' to whom you  refer merely regard you as a unit of our rather large population. In a  case of this kind, Coverly, all men are equal.\"    Whilst I had been delivering myself of this somewhat priggish  speech--designed, I may add, in self-defense, to spur Coverly to a  rejoinder which might throw some light upon the mystery--he had  regarded me with an expression of ever increasing dislike. I noted  that there were shadows under his eyes, and that he was in a highly  nervous and excited condition. He had slept but little I judged during  the last forty-eight hours and had possibly had recourse to stimulants  to enable him to face the new trials which arose with every day.    \"I don't feel called upon,\" he said angrily, \"to give an account of my  movements to every policeman who cares to inquire. I know nothing  whatever about the matter. I have said so, and I am not accustomed to  have my word doubted.\"    \"My dear Coverly,\" said I, \"you must be perfectly well aware that  sooner or later you will have to relinquish this heroic pose. Will you  allow no one to advise you? You will have to answer the coroner, and  if you persist in this extraordinary refusal to give a simple answer  to a simple question, surely you realize that the matter will be  transferred to a higher tribunal?\"    \"Oh, I told you that they had hanged me in Fleet Street already,  Isobel!\" cried Coverly, with a burst of unmirthful laughter.    But (and no man could have construed the thing favorably to Coverly)  to my anger and amazement he added:    \"Let them do it! I'll speak if I choose, but not otherwise!\"    That I was annoyed with the young fool already, my remarks to him,  which had transgressed every code of good taste, must sufficiently  have shown. But I had hoped to provoke him to a declaration which  would clear his name from the shadow which was settling darkly upon  it, and which would raise that shadow from the girl who stood beside  him, watching me with a sort of reproachful look in her dark eyes.    Now I recognized that I could remain no longer and keep the peace,  therefore:    \"Perhaps it is time that I went about my own business,\" I said,  conjuring up a smile, although it must have been a dreary one, \"and  ceased to interfere with the affairs of other people. Good-by, Isobel.  Anything I can do, you know you may command. Good-by, Coverly. I am  deeply sorry about this business.\"    He barely touched my extended hand, but instantly turned and walked to  the bay window. Descending to the street, I had immediate confirmation  of Coverly's statement that his movements were watched.    In the porch below a man stood talking to the hall-porter. As I  appeared he immediately averted his face and began to light a  cigarette. Nevertheless I had had time to recognize him as the man who  had brought Gatton news of Marie's detention.    It was in a truly perturbed frame of mind that I proceeded on my way  to the _Planet_ offices. I would have sacrificed much to have been  afforded means to comfort Isobel; a furious anger towards the man who  thus deliberately had brought doubt and unhappiness upon her had taken  up permanent quarters in my mind. I counted Coverly's declination to  clear himself little better than the attitude of a cad.    I read religiously through a pile of cuttings bearing upon the case,  and found the unmistakable trend of opinion to be directed towards  Coverly as the culprit. The use made of Isobel's name enraged me to  boiling point and I presently took up the entire bundle of cuttings  and crammed them into a waste-paper basket. I was engaged in stamping  them down with my foot when I was called to the telephone.    Inspector Gatton was speaking from New Scotland Yard; and his voice  was very grave.    \"Can you possibly come along at once?\" he asked. \"There is a new  development; a most unpleasant one.\"    He would say no more over the telephone. Therefore I hurried out to  where Coates was waiting, and in ten minutes found myself in one of  those bare, comfortless apartments which characterize the headquarters  of the Metropolitan Police Force.    With his hat off Gatton looked more like a seaman than ever, for he  had short, crisply curly hair and that kind of bull-dog line of  cranium which one associates with members of the senior service. Upon  a chair set in a recess formed by one of the lofty windows a leather  grip rested. It was wet and stained, and had palpably been recovered  but recently from the water. Seeing my glance straying towards this  object at the moment of my entrance, the Inspector nodded.    \"Yes,\" said he, \"it has just come in.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"Well,\" replied Gatton, sitting upon a corner of the table and folding  his arms, \"it is a piece of evidence sufficient to hang the most  innocent man breathing.\"    He eyed me in a significant manner and I felt my heart beginning to  beat more rapidly.    \"May I know the particulars?\"    \"Certainly. I asked you to come along for the purpose of telling you.  Sir Eric Coverly's refusal to answer the questions put to him had  necessitated his being watched, as you know. I mean to say, it's  sheerly automatic; the Commissioner himself couldn't make an  exception. Well, last night he left his chambers and started for Miss  Merlin's flat. He came out of a back door and went along a narrow  passage, instead of going out at the"]]]
