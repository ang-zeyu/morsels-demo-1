The chair of philosophy at Cyrene was afterwards filled by Arete, the  daughter of Aristippus; for such were the hindrances in the way of  gaining knowledge, that few could be so well qualified to teach as the  philosopher's daughter. Books were costly, and reading by no means  a cheap amusement. She was followed, after her death, by her son  Aristippus, who, having been brought up in his mother's lecture-room,  was called, in order to distinguish him from his grandfather of the same  name, Metrodidactus, or _mother-taught_. History has not told us whether  he took the name himself in gratitude for the debt which he owed to this  learned lady, or whether it was given him by his pupils; but in either  case it was a sure way of giving to the mother the fame which was due to  her for the education of her son; for no one could fail to ask who was  the mother of Metrodidactus.    Theodorus, one of the pupils of Metrodidactus, though at one time  banished from Cyrene, rose to honour under Soter, and was sent by him as  ambassador to Lysimachus, He was called the Atheist by his enemies, and  the Divine by his friends, but we cannot now determine which title he  best deserved. It was then usual to call those atheists who questioned  the existence of the pagan gods; and we must not suppose that all who  suffered under that reproach denied that the world was governed by a  ruling providence. The disbeliever in the false religion of the many is  often the only real believer in a God. Theodorus was of the cold school  of philosophy, which was chiefly followed in Alexandria. It was earthly,  lifeless, and unpoetical, arising from the successful cultivation of  the physical sciences, not enough counteracted by the more ennobling  pursuits of poetry and the fine arts. Hence, while commerce and the arts  of production were carried to higher perfection than at any former  time, and science was made greatly to assist in the supply of our bodily  wants, the arts of civilisation, though by no means neglected, were  cultivated without any lofty aim, or any true knowledge of their  dignity.    [Illustration: 092.jpg THE CHARIOT OF ANTIPHILUS]    Antiphilus, who was born in Egypt and had studied painting under  Ctesidemus, rose to high rank as a painter in Alexandria. Among his  best-known pictures were the bearded Bacchus, the young Alexander, and  Hip-polytus, or rather his chariot-horses, frightened by the bull. His  boy, blowing up a fire with his mouth, was much praised for the mouth  of the boy, and for the light and shade of the room. His Ptolemy  hunting was also highly thought of. Antiphilus showed a mean jealousy  of Apelles, and accused him of joining in a plot against the king, for  which the painter narrowly escaped punishment; but Ptolemy, finding that  the charge was not true, sent Apelles a gift of one hundred talents to  make amends. The angry feelings of Apelles were by no means cooled by  this gift, but they boiled over in his great picture of Calumny. On the  right of the picture sat Ptolemy, holding out his hand to Calumny, who  was coming up to him. On each side of the king stood a woman who seemed  meant for Ignorance and Suspicion. Calumny was a beautiful maiden, but  with angry and deep-rooted malice in her face: in her left hand was a  lighted torch, and with her right she was dragging along by the hair  a young man, who was stretching forth his hands to heaven, and calling  upon the gods to bear witness that he was guiltless. Before her walked  Envy, a pale, hollow-eyed, diseased man, perhaps a portrait of  the accuser; and behind were two women, Craft and Deceit, who were  encouraging and supporting her. At a distance stood Repentance, in the  ragged, black garb of mourning, who was turning away her face for shame  as Truth came up to her.    Ptolemy Soter was plain in his manners, and scarcely surpassed his own  generals in the costliness of his way of life. He often dined and slept  at the houses of his friends; and his own house had so little of the  palace, that he borrowed dishes and tables of his friends when he asked  any number of them to dine with him in return, saying that it was the  part of a king to enrich others rather than to be rich himself. Before  he took the title of king, he styled himself, and was styled by friendly  states, by the simple name of Ptolemy the Macedonian; and during the  whole of his reign he was as far from being overbearing in his behaviour  as from being kinglike in his dress and household. Once when he wished  to laugh at a boasting antiquary, he asked him, what he knew could not  be answered, who was the father of Peleus; and the other let his wit so  far get the better of his prudence as in return to ask the king, who had  perhaps never heard the name of his own grandfather, if he knew who was  the father of Lagus. But Ptolemy took no further notice of this than to  remark that if a king cannot bear rude answers he ought not to ask rude  questions.    An answer which Ptolemy once made to a soothsayer might almost be taken  as the proverb which had guided him through life. When his soldiers met  with an anchor in one of their marches, and were disheartened on being  told by the soothsayer that it was a proof that they ought to stop where  they then were, the king restored their courage by remarking, that an  anchor was an omen of safety, not of delay.    Ptolemy's first children were by Thais, the noted courtesan, but they  were not thought legitimate. Leontiscus, the eldest, we afterwards hear  of fighting bravely against Demetrius; of the second, named Lagus after  his grandfather, we hear nothing.    He then married Eurydice, the daughter of Antipater, by whom he had  several children. The eldest son, Ptolemy, was named Ceraunus, _the  Thunderer_, and was banished by his father from Alexandria. In his  distress he fled to Seleucus, by whom he was kindly received; but after  the death of Ptolemy Soter he basely plotted against Seleucus and  put him to death. He then defeated in battle Antigonus, the son of  Demetrius, and got possession of Macedonia for a short time. He married  his half-sister Arsinoe, and put her children to death; and was soon  afterwards put to death himself by the Gauls, who were either fighting  against him or were mercenaries in his own army. Another son of Ptolemy  and Eurydice was put to death by Ptolemy Philadelphus, for plotting  against his throne, to which, as the elder brother, he might have  thought himself the best entitled. Their daughter Lysander married  Agathocles, the son of Lysimachus; but when Agathocles was put to death  by his father, she fled to Egypt with her children, and put herself  under Ptolemy's care.    Ptolemy then, as we have seen, asked in marriage the hand of Cleopatra,  the sister of Alexander; but on her death he married Berenice, a lady  who had come into Egypt with Eurydice, and had formed part of her  household. She was the widow of a man named Philip; and she had by her  first husband a son named Magas, whom Ptolemy made governor of Cyrene,  and a daughter, Antigone, whom Ptolemy gave in marriage to Pyrrhus when  that young king was living in Alexandria as hostage for Demetrius.    Berenice's mildness and goodness of heart were useful in softening her  husband's severity. Once, when Ptolemy was unbending his mind at a game  of dice with her, one of his officers came up to his side, and began to  read over to him a list of criminals who had been condemned to death,  with their crimes, and to ask his pleasure on each.    [Illustration: 095.jpg BERENICE SOTER]    Ptolemy continued playing, and gave very little attention to the unhappy  tale; but Berenice's feelings overcame the softness of her character,  and she took the paper out of the officer's hand, and would not let him  finish reading it; saying it was very unbecoming in the king to treat  the matter so lightly, as if he thought no more of the loss of a life  than the loss of a throw.    With Berenice Ptolemy spent the rest of his years without anything to  trouble the happiness of his family. He saw their elder son, Ptolemy,  whom we must call by the name which he took late in life, Philadelphus,  grow up everything that he could wish him to be; and, moved alike by his  love for the mother and by the good qualities of the son, he chose  him as his successor on the throne, instead of his eldest son, Ptolemy  Ceraunus, who had shown, by every act in his life, his unfitness for the  royal position.    His daughter Arsinoe married Lysimachus in his old age, and urged  him against his son, Agathocles, the husband of her own sister. She  afterwards married her half-brother, Ptolemy Ceraunus; and lastly became  the wife of her brother Philadelphus. Argzeus, the youngest son of  Ptolemy, was put to death by Philadelphus on a charge of treason. Of  his youngest daughter Philotera we know nothing, except that her brother  Philadelphus afterwards named a city on the coast of the Red Sea after  her.    After the last battle with Demetrius, Ptolemy had regained the island of  Cyprus and Cole-Syria, including Judaea; and his throne became stronger  as his life drew to an end. With a wisdom rare in kings and conquerors,  he had never let his ambition pass his means; he never aimed at  universal power; and he was led, both by his kind feelings and  wise policy, to befriend all those states which, like his own, were  threatened by that mad ambition in others.    His history of Alexander's wars is lost, and we therefore cannot judge  of his merits as an author; but we may still point out with pleasure how  much his people gained from his love of letters; though indeed we do not  need the example of Ptolemy to show that learning and philosophy are as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#14)"],[1,"was the holy animal Mnevis, a rival or comrade of Apis. Cambyses  had partly destroyed the temple and even the obelisks which the Pharaohs  had in the course of centuries erected to the sun-god; nowhere in Egypt  existed so many of these monuments as here and in Thebes. Hadrian saw  many of them lying half-burnt on the ground just as Strabo had done.  On the site of Heliopolis, now green with wheat-fields, only a single  obelisk has remained upright, which is considered as the oldest of all,  and was erected in the twelfth dynasty by Usirtasen I.    The royal assemblage had arrived in the course of their journey at Besa,  a place on the right bank of the river, opposite Hermopolis, when a  strange event occurred. This was the death of Hadrian's favourite,  Antinous, a young Greek from Claudiopolis, who had been degraded to the  position of Ganymede to the emperor on account of his beauty. It is not  known where the emperor first came across the youth; possibly in his  native land, Bithynia. Not till he came to Egypt did he become his  inseparable companion, and this must have been a deep offence to  his wife. The unfortunate queen was delivered in Besa from his hated  presence, for Antinous was drowned there in the Nile.    His death was surrounded by mystery. Was it accident? Was he a victim?  Hadrian's humanity protects him from the suspicion that he sacrificed  his victim in cold blood, as Tiberius had once sacrificed the beautiful  Hypatus in Capri. Had the fantastic youth sacrificed himself of his own  free will to the death divinities in order to save the emperor's life?  Had the Egyptian priests foreseen in the stars some danger threatening  Hadrian, only to be averted by the death of his favourite? Such an idea  commended itself to the superstition of the time, especially in  this land and by the mysterious Nile. It corresponded, too, with the  emperor's astrological arts. Was Antinous certain when he plunged into  the waves of the Nile that he would arise from them as a god? Hadrian  asserts in his memoirs that it was an accident, but no one believed him.  The divine honours which he paid to the dead youth lead us to suppose  that they formed the reward of a self-sacrifice, which, according to the  custom of those times, constituted a highly moral action, and was looked  upon as heroic devotion. At any rate, we will assume that this sacrifice  sank into the Nile without Hadrian's will. Hadrian mourned for Antinous  with unspeakable pain and \"womanly tears.\" Now he was Achilles by the  corpse of Patroklus, or Alexander by the pyre of the dead Hephaistus.  He had the youth splendidly buried in Besa. This most extraordinary  intermezzo of all Nile journeys supplied dying heathendom with a new  god, and art with its last ideal form. Probably, also, during the  burial, far-sighted courtiers already saw the star of Antinous shining  in Egypt's midnight sky, and then Hadrian saw it himself.    In the mystical land of Egypt, life might still be poetical even in the  clear daylight of Roman universal history in the reign of Hadrian. The  death of the young Bithynian seems to have occurred in October, 130.  The emperor continued his journey as soon as he had given orders for  a splendid town to be erected on the site of Besa, in honour of his  friend. In November, 130, the royal company is to be found amongst the  ruins of Thebes.    Thebes, the oldest town in Egypt, had been first put in the shade  by Memphis, and then destroyed by Cambyses. Since the time of the  Ptolemies, it had been called Diospolis, and Ptolemais had taken its  place as capital of the Thebaid. Already in Strabo's time it was split  up. It formed on either side of the Nile groups of gigantic temples and  palaces, monuments, and royal graves similar to those scattered to-day  amongst Luxor, Karnak, Medinet-Habu, Deir-el-Bahari, and Kurna.    [Illustration: 095.jpg COMMEMORATIVE COIN OF ANTINOUS]    In Hadrian's time the Rameseum, the so-called grave of Osymandias, on  the western bank of the Nile, the wonderful building of Ramses II.,  must still have been in good repair. These pylons, pillars, arcades, and  courts, these splendid halls with their sculpture-covered walls, appear  even to have influenced the Roman art in the time of the emperors. Their  reflex influence has been even seen in Trajan's forum, in which the  chief thing was the emperor's tomb.    In Alexandria the emperor mixed freely with the professors of the  museum, asking them questions and answering theirs in return; and he  dropped his tear of pity on the tomb of the great Pompey, in the form of  a Greek epigram, though with very little point. He laid out large sums  of money in building and ornamenting the city, and the Alexandrians were  much pleased with his behaviour. Among other honours that they paid  him, they changed the name of the month December, calling it the month  Hadrian; but as they were not followed by the rest of the empire the  name soon went out of use. The emperor's patronage of philosophy was  rather at the cost of the Alexandrian museum, for he enrolled among its  paid professors men who were teaching from school to school in Italy and  Asia Minor. Thus Polemon of Laodicea, who taught oratory and philosophy  at Rome, Laodicea, and Smyrna, and had the right of a free passage for  himself and his servants in any of the public ships whenever he chose to  move from city to city for the purposes of study or teaching, had at  the same time a salary from the Alexandrian museum. Dionysius of Miletus  also received his salary as a professor in the museum while teaching  philosophy and mnemonicsat Miletus and Ephesus. Pancrates, the  Alexandrian poet, gained his salary in the museum by the easy task of a  little flattery. On Hadrian's return to Alexandria from the Thebaid, the  poet presented to him a rose-coloured lotus, a flower well known in  India, though less common in Egypt than either the blue or white lotus,  and assured him that it had sprung out of the blood of the lion slain by  his royal javelin at a lion-hunt in Libya.    [Illustration: 097.jpg ROSE-COLOURED LOTUS]    The emperor was pleased with the compliment, and gave him a place in the  museum; and Pancrates in return named the plant the lotus of Antinous.  Pancrates was a warm admirer of the mystical opinions of the Egyptians  which were then coming into note in Alexandria. He was said to have  lived underground in holy solitude or converse with the gods for  twenty-three years, and during that time to have been taught magic by  the goddess Isis, and thus to have gained the power of working miracles.  He learned to call upon the queen of darkness by her Egyptian name  Hecate, and when driving out evil spirits to speak to them in the  Egyptian language. Whether these Greek students of the Eastern mysticism  were deceivers or deceived, whether they were led by a love of notoriety  or of knowledge, is in most cases doubtful, but they were surrounded by  a crowd of credulous admirers, who formed a strange contrast with the  sceptics and critics of the museum.    Among the Alexandrian grammarians of this reign was Apollonius Dyscolus,  so called perhaps from a moroseness of manner, who wrote largely on  rhetoric, on the Greek dialects, on accents, prosody, and on other  branches of grammar. In the few pages that remain of his numerous  writings, we trace the love of the marvellous which was then growing  among some of the philosophers. He tells us many remarkable stories,  which he collected rather as a judicious inquirer than as a credulous  believer; such as of second sight; an account of a lad who fell asleep  in the field while watching his sheep, and then slept for fifty-seven  years, and awoke to wonder at the strangeness of the changes that had  taken place in the meanwhile; and of a man who after death used from  time to time to leave his body, and wander over the earth as a spirit,  till his wife, tired of his coming back again so often, put a stop to it  by having his mummy burnt. He gives us for the first time Eastern tales  in a Greek dress, and we thus learn the source from which Europe gained  much of its literature in the Middle Ages. The Alexandrian author of  greatest note at this time was the historian Appian, who tells us that  he had spent some years in Rome practising as a lawyer, and returned to  Egypt on being appointed to a high post in the government of his native  city. There he wrote his Roman history.    In this reign the Jews, forgetful of what they had just suffered under  Trajan, again rose against the power of Rome; and, when Judaea rebelled  against its prefect, Tinnius Rufus, a little army of Jews marched out of  Egypt and Libya, to help their brethren and to free the holy land  (130 A.D.). But they were everywhere routed and put down with resolute  slaughter.    [Illustration: 099.jpg VOCAL STATUE OF AMENHOTHES]    Travellers, on reaching a distant point of a journey, or on viewing any  remarkable object of their curiosity, have at all times been fond of  carving or scribbling their names on the spot, to boast of their  prowess to after-comers; and never had any place been more favoured with  memorials of this kind than the great statue of Amenhothes at Thebes.  This colossal statue, fifty-three feet high, was famed, as long as  the Egyptian priesthood lasted, for sending forth musical sounds  every morning at sunrise, when first touched by the sun's rays; and no  traveller ever visited Thebes without listening for these remarkable  notes. The journey through Upper Egypt was at this time perfectly open  and safe, and the legs and feet of the statue are covered with names,  and inscriptions in prose and verse, of travellers who had visited it  at sunrise during the reigns of Hadrian and the Antonines. From these  curious memorials we learn that Hadrian visited Thebes a second time  with his queen, Sabina, in the fifteenth year of his reign. When the  empress "]]]
