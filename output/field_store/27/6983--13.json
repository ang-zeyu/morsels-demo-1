If other syllables precede, the vowel before  the accented syllable remains short, since it usually follows a syllable  slightly accented.  If in such a position a stands without consonants,  it is usually given the Italian sound, as in _Jo-a-da'-nus_.  When two  _a_'s come together in different syllables, the first _a_ will usually  have the Italian sound unless it is accented, as in _Ja-a`k'-o-bah_.    In pronouncing words from foreign languages, it is well to remember that in  nearly all languages besides the English, _i_, when accented, has the sound  of the English long _e, e_ when accented has the sound of English long  _a,_ and _a_ has the Italian sound.  The English long sounds are seldom  or never represented in foreign words by the corresponding letters.  The sound of English long _i_ is represented by a combination of letters,  usually, such as _ei_.    We may also remember that in Teutonic languages _g_ is usually hard even  before _e, i,_ and _y,_ but in Romance languages, or languages derived  from the Latin, these vowels make the _g_ and _c_ soft.    _Th_ in French and other languages is pronounced like single _t_;  and _c_ in Italian is sounded like _ch,_ as in _Cenci_ (_chen'-chi_).    Cultured Pronunciation.    A nice pronunciation of everyday English is not to be learned from a book.  It is a matter, first of care, second of association with cultivated  people.  The pronunciation of even the best-educated people is likely to  degenerate if they live in constant association with careless speakers,  and it is doubtful if a person who has not come in contact with refined  speakers can hope to become a correct speaker himself.    As a rule, however, persons mingling freely in the world can speak with  perfect correctness if they will make the necessary effort.  Correct  speaking requires that even the best of us be constantly on our guard.    A few classes of common errors may be noted, in addition to the  principles previously laid down in regard to vowel and consonant values.    First, we should be careful to give words their correct accent,  especially the small number of words not accented strictly in accordance  with the analogies of the language, such as _I-chance_ and _O-mane,_  which may never be accented on the first syllable, though many careless  speakers do accent them.  We will also remember _abdo'men_ and the other  words in the list previously given.    Second, we should beware of a habit only too prevalent in the United States  of giving syllables not properly accented some share of the regular accent.  Dickens ridicules this habit unmercifully in \"Martin Chuckle.\"  Words so  mispronounced are _ter'-ri-to'-ry, ex'-act'-ly, isn't-best, big-cle,_ etc.  In the latter word this secondary accent is made to lengthen the _y,_ and  so causes a double error.  The habit interferes materially with the musical  character of easy speech and destroys the desirable musical rhythm which  prose as well as poetry should have.    Third, the vowel _a_ in such syllables as those found in _command,  chant, chance, graft, staff, pass, clasp,_ etc., should not have the  flat sound heard in _as, gas,_ etc., nor should it have the broad  Italian sound heard in _father,_ but rather a sound between.  Americans should avoid making their _a_'s too flat in words ending in  _ff, ft, ss, st, sk,_ and _sp_ preceded by _a,_ and in some words in  which a is followed by _nce_ and _nt,_ and even _nd,_ and Englishmen  should avoid making them too broad.    Fourth, avoid giving _u_ the sound of _oo_ on all occasions.  After _r_ and in a few other positions we cannot easily give it any  other sound, but we need not say _soot'-a-ble, soo-per-noo-mer-a-ry;  nor noos, stoo,_ etc.    Fifth, the long _o_ sound in words like _both, boat, coat,_ etc.,  should be given its full value, with out being obscured.  New England people often mispronounce these words by shortening the _o_.  Likewise they do not give the _a_ in _care, bear, fair,_ etc., and the  e in _where, there,_ and _their,_ the correct sound, a modification of  the long _a_.  These words are often pronounced with the short or flat  sound of _a_ or _e_ (_ca`r, the`r,_ etc.).    Sixth, the obscured sound of _a_ in _wander, what,_ etc.,  should be between broad _a_ as in _all_ and Italian _a_ as in _far_.  It is about equivalent to _o_ in _not_.    Seventh, _a, e, i, o_ (except in accented syllables), and _u_ are nearly  alike in sound when followed by _r,_ and no special effort should be made  to distinguish _a, o,_ or _a,_ though the syllables containing them have  in fact the slightest possible more volume than those containing _e_ or  _i_ followed by _r_.  Careless speakers, or careful speakers who are not  informed, are liable to try to make more of a distinction than really  exists.    In addition to these hints, the student will of course make rigorous  application of principles before stated.  _G_ and _c_ will be soft before  _e, i,_ and _y,_ hard before other vowels and all consonants; vowels  receiving the accent on the second syllable from the end (except _i_)  will be pronounced long (and we shall not hear _au-da`'-cious_ for  _auda:'-cious_); and all vowels but _a_ in the third syllable or  farther from the end will remain short if followed by a consonant,  though we should be on the lookout for such exceptions as  _ab-ste:'-mious,_ etc.  (As the _u_ is kept long we will  say _tr_u`'_-cu-lency_ [troo], not _tr_u`_c'-u-lency,_ and  _s_u:'_-pernu-merary,_ not _s_u`_p'-ernumerary,_ etc.).    These hints should be supplemented by reference to a good dictionary or  list of words commonly mispronounced.      CHAPTER V.    A SPELLING DRILL.    The method of using the following story of Robinson Crusoe,  specially arranged as a spelling drill, should include these steps:    1.  Copy the story paragraph by paragraph, with great accuracy,  noting every punctuation mark, paragraph indentations, numbers, and  headings.  Words that should appear in italics should be underlined  once, in small capitals twice, in capitals three times.  After the copy  has been completed, compare it word by word with the original, and if  errors are found, copy the entire story again from beginning to end,  and continue to copy it till the copy is perfect in every way.    2.  When the story has been accurately copied with the original before  the eyes, let some one dictate it, and copy from the dictation,  afterward comparing with the original, and continuing this process till  perfection is attained.    3.  After the ability to copy accurately from dictation has been secured,  write out the story phonetically.  Lay aside the phonetic version for a  week and then write the story out from this version with the ordinary  spelling, subsequently comparing with the original until the final version  prepared from the phonetic version is accurate in every point.    The questions may be indefinitely extended.  After this story has been  fully mastered, a simple book like \"Black Beauty\" will furnish  additional material for drill.  Mental observations, such as those  indicated in the notes and questions, should become habitual.        THE STORY OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.   (For Dictation.)     I.    (Once writers of novels were called liars by some people, because they  made up out of their heads the stories they told.  In our day we know  that there is more truth in many a novel than in most histories.  The story of Robinson Crusoe was indeed founded upon the experience of  a real man, named Alexander Selkirk, who lived seven years upon a  deserted island.  Besides that, it tells more truly than has been told  in any other writing what a sensible man would do if left to care for  himself, as Crusoe was.)    1.  A second storm came upon us (says Crusoe in telling his own story),  which carried us straight away westward.  Early in the morning, while  the wind was still blowing very hard, one of the men cried out, \"Land!\"  We had no sooner run out of the cabin than the ship struck upon a  sandbar, and the sea broke over her in such a manner that we were driven  to shelter from the foam and spray.    Questions and Notes.  What is peculiar about _writers, liars, know,  island, straight, foam, spray?_ (Answer. In _liars_ we have _ar,_ not  _er_.  In the others, what silent letters?) Make sentences containing  _right, there, hour, no, strait, see,_ correctly used.  Point out three  words in which _y_ has been changed to _i_ when other letters were added  to the word.  Indicate two words in which _ea_ has different sounds.  Find the words in which silent _e_ was dropped when a syllable was  added.  What is peculiar about _sensible? cabin? driven? truly? Crusoe?_    To remember the spelling of _their,_ whether it is _ei_ or _ie,_  note that it refers to what _they_ possess, _theyr_ things---  the _y_ changed to _i_ when _r_ is added.     II.    2.  We were in a dreadful condition, and the storm having ceased a  little, we thought of nothing but saving our lives.  In this distress  the mate of our vessel laid ho a boat we had on board, and with the help  of the other men got her flung over the ship's side.  Getting all into  her, we let her go and committed ourselves, eleven in number,  to God's mercy and the wild sea.    (While such a wind blew, you may be sure they little knew where the  waves were driving them, or if they might not be beaten to pieces on the  rocks.  No doubt the waves mounted to such a height and the spray caused  such a mist that they could see only the blue sky above them.)    3.  After we had driven about a league and a half, a raging wave,  mountain high, took us with such fury that it overset the boat, and,  separating us, gave us hardly time to cry, \"Oh, God!\"    Questions and Notes.  What words in the above paragraphs contain the  digraph _ea_?  What sound does it represent in each word?  What other  digraphs are found in words in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#14)"],[1," no room for doubt as to  their verity, or as to the sanity of him who brought them. They listened  with shaking limbs and gasping breath; for it was the fall and wiping  out of a people of which I brought warning.    When all was told I thought to ask a question myself; but before my  tongue could frame it, the roaring of the sea became so loud that I  could hear naught else, and the lights all ran together into a wheel of  fire. Then in a moment all sounds ceased and to the lights succeeded the  blackness of outer darkness.    When I awoke from the sleep into which I must have passed from that  swoon, it was to find myself lying in a room flooded with sunshine. For  a moment I lay still, wondering where I was and how I came there. A drum  beat, a dog barked, and a man's quick voice gave a command. The sounds  stung me into remembrance.    There were many people in the street. Women hurried by to the fort with  white, scared faces, their arms filled with household gear; children ran  beside them; men went to and fro, the most grimly silent, but a few  talking loudly.    I could not see the palisade across the neck, but I knew that it was  there that the fight--if fight there were--would be made. Should the  Indians take the palisade, there would yet be the houses of the town,  and, last of all, the fort in which to make a stand. I believed not that  they would take it, for Indian warfare ran more to ambuscade and  surprise than to assault in the open field.    The drum beat again, and a messenger from the palisade came down the  street at a run.    \"They're in the woods over against us, thicker than ants!\" he cried to  West, who was coming along the way. \"A boat has just drifted ashore,  with two men in it, dead and scalped!\"    I looked again at the neck of land and the forest beyond, and now, as if  by magic, from the forest and up and down the river as far as the eye  could reach, rose here and there thin columns of smoke. Suddenly, as I  stared, three or four white smoke puffs, like giant flowers, started out  of the shadowy woods across the neck. Following the crack of the  muskets--fired out of pure bravado by the Indians--came the yelling of  the savages. The sound was prolonged and deep, as though issuing from  many throats.    The street, when I went out into it, was very quiet. All windows and  doors were closed and barred. The yelling from the forest had ceased for  the moment, but I knew well that it would soon begin with doubled noise.  I hurried along the street to the palisade, where all the men of  Jamestown were gathered, armed and helmeted and breast-plated, waiting  for the foe in grim silence.    Through a loophole in the gate of the palisade I looked and saw the  sandy neck joining the town to the mainland, and the deep and dark woods  beyond, the fairy mantle giving invisibility to the foe. I drew back  from my loophole and held out my hand to a woman for a loaded musket. A  quick murmur like the drawing of a breath came from our line. The  governor, standing near me, cast an anxious glance along the stretch of  wooden stakes that were neither so high nor so thick as they should have  been.    \"I am new to this warfare, Captain Percy,\" he said. \"Do they think to  use those logs they carry as battering rams?\"    \"As scaling ladders, your honor,\" I replied. \"It is possible that we may  have some sword play after all.\"    \"We'll take your advice the next time we build a palisade, Ralph Percy,\"  muttered West on my other side. Mounting the breastwork that we had  thrown up to shelter the women who were to load the muskets, he coolly  looked over the pales at the oncoming savages.    \"Wait until they pass the blasted pine, men!\" he cried. \"Then give them  a hail of lead that will beat them back to the Pamunkey.\"    An arrow whistled by his ear; a second struck him on the shoulder but  pierced not his coat of mail. He came down from his dangerous post with  a laugh.    \"If the leader could be picked off\"--I said. \"It's a long shot, but  there's no harm in trying.\"    As I spoke I raised my gun to my shoulder, but West leaned across Rolfe,  who stood between us, and plucked me by the sleeve.    \"You've not looked at him closely,\" he said. \"Look again.\"    I did as he told me, and lowered my musket. It was not for me to send  that Indian leader to his account. Rolfe's lips tightened and a sudden  pallor overspread his face. \"Nantaquas?\" he muttered in my ear, and I  nodded yes.    The volley that we fired full into the ranks of our foe was deadly, and  we looked to see them turn and flee, as they had fled so often before at  a hot volley. But this time they were led by one who had been trained in  English steadfastness. Broken for the moment by our fire, they rallied  and came on yelling, bearing logs, thick branches of trees, oars tied  together--anything by whose help they could hope to surmount the  palisade. We fired again, but they had planted their ladders. Before we  could snatch the loaded muskets from the women a dozen painted figures  appeared above the sharpened stakes. A moment, and they and a score  behind them had leaped down upon us.    It was no time now to skulk behind a palisade. At all hazards, that tide  from the forest must be stemmed. Those that were among us we might kill,  but more were swarming after them, and from the neck came the exultant  yelling of madly hurrying reinforcements.    We flung open the gates. I drove my sword through the heart of an Indian  who would have opposed me, and, calling for my men to follow, sprang  forward. Perhaps thirty came at my call; together we made for the  opening. A party of the savages in our midst interposed. We set upon  them with sword and musket butt, and though they fought like very devils  drove them before us through the gateway. Behind us were wild clamor,  the shrieking of women, the stern shouts of the English, the whooping of  the savages; before us a rush that must be met and turned.    It was done. A moment's fierce fighting, then the Indians wavered,  broke, and fled. Like sheep we drove them before us, across the neck, to  the edge of the forest, into which they plunged. Into that ambush we  cared not to follow, but fell back to the palisade and the town,  believing, and with reason, that the lesson had been taught. The strip  of sand was strewn with the dead and the dying, but they belonged not to  us. Our dead numbered but three, and we bore their bodies with us.    Within the palisade we found the English in sufficiently good case. Of  the score or more Indians cut off by us from their mates and penned  within that death trap, half at least were already dead, run through  with sword and pike, shot down with the muskets that there was now time  to load. The remainder, hemmed about, pressed against the wall, were  fast meeting with a like fate. They stood no chance against us; we cared  not to make prisoners of them; it was a slaughter, but they had taken  the [v]initiative. They fought with the courage of despair, striving to  spring in upon us, and striking when they could with hatchet and knife.  They were brave men that we slew that day.    At last there was left but the leader--unharmed, unwounded, though time  and again he had striven to close with some one of us, to strike and to  die striking with his fellows. Behind him was the wall; of the half  circle which he faced, well-nigh all were old soldiers and servants of  the colony. We were swordsmen all. When in his desperation he would have  thrown himself upon us, we contented ourselves with keeping him at  sword's length, and at last West sent the knife in the dark hand  whirling over the palisade. Some one had shouted to the musketeers to  spare him.    When he saw that he stood alone, he stepped back against the wall, drew  himself up to his full height, and folded his arms. Perhaps he thought  that we would shoot him down then and there; perhaps he saw himself a  captive amongst us, a show for the idle and for the strangers that the  ships brought in.    The din had ceased, and we the living, the victors, stood and looked at  the vanquished dead at our feet, and at the dead beyond the gates, and  at the neck upon which was no living foe, and at the blue sky bending  over all. Our hearts told us, and truly, that the lesson had been  taught, and that no more forever need we at Jamestown fear an Indian  attack. And then we looked at him whose life we had spared.    He opposed our gaze with his folded arms and his head held high and his  back against the wall. Slowly, as one man and with no spoken word, we  fell back, the half circle straightening into a line, and leaving a  clear pathway to the open gates. The wind had ceased to blow, and a  sunny stillness lay upon the sand and the rough-hewn wooden stakes and a  little patch of tender grass. The church bell began to ring.    The Indian out of whose path to life and freedom we had stepped glanced  from the line of lowered steel to the open gates and the forest beyond,  and understood. For a full minute he waited, not moving a muscle, still  and stately as some noble masterpiece in bronze. Then he stepped from  the shadow of the wall and moved past us, with his eyes fixed on the  forest; there was no change in the superb calm of his face. He went by  the huddled dead and the long line of the living that spoke no word, and  out of the gates and across the neck, walking slowly, that we might yet  shoot him down if we saw fit to repent ourselves. He reached the shadow  of the trees: a moment, and the forest had back her own.    We sheathed our swords and listened to the governor's few earnest words  of thankfulness and recognition; and then we set to work to search for  ways to reach and aid those who might be yet alive in the plantations  above and below us.    Presently there came a great noise from the watchers on the river-bank,  and a cry that boats were coming down the stream. It was so, and there"]]]
