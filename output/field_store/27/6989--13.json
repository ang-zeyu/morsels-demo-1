On Christmas Day, too.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children  over with ye.    MRS. MULLIGAN. The whole tin of them?    MRS. O'TOOLE (_counting on fingers_).         Patsy and Matsy,       And Teddy Magee,       Nora Eudora,       And Micky Machree,       Bridget Honora,       And sweet Mary Ann,       Melissa, Clarissa,       And wee Peter Pan.    MRS. MULLIGAN. And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?    MRS. O'TOOLE. All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye  see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as  big as a billy-goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's  married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose.  And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.    MRS. O'TOOLE. I says to Pat, says I, \"Christmas ain't Christmas at  all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner.\" \"What'll we  do?\" says Pat. \"Invite the Mulligans,\" says I. And Pat was tickled to  death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and  we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple  fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four  punkin ones--and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas  Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole,  and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.    MRS. O'TOOLE. If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas  Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly  and loving at all, at all.    MRS. MULLIGAN. And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee  Peter Pan.    MRS. O'TOOLE. I am that. Here's the little, fat body. (_Shows  cylindrical piece of dark green squash._) And here's the four legs.  (_Shows two bananas cut in half._) I'll just stick the legs on with  nails--and there he stands. Now, here's a little potato for a head,  and an ould skinny carrot for a trunk. I'll stick them on with a hair  pin. (_Does so._) Now, I'll stick on the ears and put in the  shoe-button eyes, and with this wee bit of black paper for a  tailpiece, and there ye are. Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as  life and twice as handsome. (_Shows elephant to audience._)    MRS. MULLIGAN. Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she  has at all, at all.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Use a big yellow apple or a wee yellow punkin, and put  on a baby cap--and there ye are. Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a  wee nose and mouth of red paper--and stick the head on the body with  some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.    MRS. MULLIGAN. I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the  iliphant.    MRS. O'TOOLE. It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children  to be home?    MRS. MULLIGAN (_goes to door at R._). It is that. (_Looks out._) And  here they come now.    (_The children are heard outside at R., singing to the tune of  \"Marching Through Georgia.\"_)         The Mulligans are coming now, as happy as can be,       We've been to the Sunday School and saw the Christmas tree,       Had a lark with Santa Claus and take a tip from me,         We'll all be marching on Christmas!    (_They march in from R., come down to front and line up._)           Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,         Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear,             Sure, it was a happy night,             The best one in the year,         And we'll be marching on Christmas!         Patsy got a trumpet, little Micky got a drum,       Matsy got a spinning top, you ought to hear it hum,       Clarissa got a candy cane, oh, won't we have the fun,         When we are marching on Christmas!           Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,         Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear,             Sure, it was a happy night,             The best one in the year.         And we'll be marching on Christmas.         Nora got a picture-book, Melissa got a rake,       Every Mulligan on deck got oranges and cake,       Got a bag of candy, too--and got the stomachache,         But we'll be marching on Christmas.           Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,         Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear,             Sure, it was a happy night,             The best one in the year.         And we'll be marching on Christmas.    (_They march around stage while singing the chorus, but line up in  front while singing the verses. Use gestures to indicate the different  persons and their toys._)    MRS. MULLIGAN. And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?    BRIDGET. Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and  a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.    MATSY. They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted  like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.    MICKY. I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have  some of the Christmas present, too.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_hugs him_). That's just like your father, Micky.    MRS. O'TOOLE (_helping children off with hats, wraps, etc._). And did  ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?    PETER PAN. Scwumptious, just scwumptious.    MARY ANN. And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the  most stylish young ladies present, so I was.    MELISSA. And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the  ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright  fairies and angels and everything.    PATSY. And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a  big pack of presents to everyone.    CLARISSA. And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off.  He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.    BRIDGET. And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up  when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.    MICKY. And they never called our names at all, at all.    MRS. MULLIGAN. That's because they didn't know them. They didn't  expect you at the party.    MARY ANN. It was a surprise party, maw.    MRS. MULLIGAN. How was it a surprise party, Mary Ann?    MARY ANN. They all looked surprised when we came in.    NORA. When I saw they weren't going to call out our names, I just rose  up in me seat and took the whole nine of 'em by the hand and marched  right up to Santa Claus. He looked real surprised at the bunch of us.    MRS. MULLIGAN. I should think he would.    NORA. \"And who are you?\" says he. \"We're the ten little Mulligans from  Mulligan Alley in Shantytown,\" says I, as cool as an icicle. \"And  we're ready for our presents, if it's all the same to you,\" says I. I  thought they was going to fire us out, but what did he do but dive way  down in the bottom of the sack and give every last one of us a  present?    TEDDY. And then he gave us bags of candy and oranges and apples and  peanuts and popcorn and a candy cane, and then they had a show and  Bridget Honora spoke a piece, she did.    MRS. O'TOOLE. How did ye happen to spake a piece, Bridget Honora?    BRIDGET. I just stood up and told 'em I knowed one. There ain't  nuthin' bashful about me. And I kind o' thought we ought to do  something to help pay fer the good things they gave us.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_petting her_). That's me good little Bridget Honora.    MELISSA (_sees doll on table_). Oh, wee! Lookee there! Where'd she  come from?    MRS. O'TOOLE. Santa Claus was after being here while you were away and  he left it for you.    MELISSA. Is it all for me?    MRS. MULLIGAN. It's the Mulligan dolly. It's fer all ten of yeez.    PATSY. She can have my share. I don't want no dolls.    MICKY. Oh, look at the efulunt. Look at the efulunt.    MRS. O'TOOLE. That is Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan from the sunny shores of  Africa, way down in Louisiana.    CHILDREN. Who's he fur? Who's he fur?    PETER PAN (_takes elephant_). He's fur me. Scwumptious!    TEDDY. Maw, they had a show there at the Sunday School. There was a  wee little man, about so long (_measures about two feet_), and he  stood up on a table and sang a song, so he did.    PATSY. Humph! I know how they did that. Matsy and me can show it to  you.    MELISSA. And they had the Turnover Topsy Turvies, too.    CLARISSA. They stood upside down on their heads.    MRS. MULLIGAN. My, my--but it must have been a wonderful show.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Just think what we missed, Mollie Mulligan.    MATSY. I didn't miss nothin'. I never miss nothin' no time.    NORA. We could give just as good a show our own selves.    OTHERS. Let's do it; let's do it. Let's give a show for maw and Mis'  O'Toole.    TEDDY. Would you like to see it, maw?    MRS. MULLIGAN. If it ain't too late.    MRS. O'TOOLE. What matters it how late it is? Christmas comes but once  a year----    ALL. And when it comes it brings good cheer.    MRS. MULLIGAN. Then sure we'll have the show. Poor folks can be just  as happy on Christmas Day as rich folks. It's all in the way you feel  about it.    PATSY. Now, maw, you and Mrs. O'Toole take your seats out there in  front. (_Points to front row of the audience._)    MATSY. I'll help you carry them out. (_They carry down two chairs from  the stage and seat_ MRS. MULLIGAN _and_ MRS. O'TOOLE _in the  audience._)    PATSY. Now, we'll have to draw the curtain to get the stage ready.    NORA. And while we're getting ready Mary Ann can say her piece.    CURTAIN FALLS.    MRS. MULLIGAN (_in audience_). My, my, Kathleen, what a large crowd of  people are here tonight. I'm afraid I'm not dressed up for the  occasion.    MRS. O'TOOLE. Dressed up, is it? Indade you are. Ye have on short  sleeves and a low-neck dress. What more would ye want? There's the  minister and his wife setting right back there.

A committee of the  Senate made a long and laborious investigation of the facts, with no  very important or satisfactory results. In their final report, June 15,  1860, accompanying the evidence obtained and submitted, this Committee  said:        \"It [the incursion] was simply the act of lawless ruffians,      under the sanction of no public or political authority,      distinguishable only from ordinary felonies by the ulterior ends      in contemplation by them, and by the fact that the money to      maintain the expedition, and the large armament they brought      with them, had been contributed and furnished by the citizens of      other States of the Union under circumstances that must continue      to jeopard the safety and peace of the Southern States, and      against which Congress has no power to legislate.        \"If the several States [adds the Committee], whether from      motives of policy or a desire to preserve the peace of the      Union, if not from fraternal feeling, do not hold it incumbent      on them, after the experience of the country, to guard in future      by appropriate legislation against occurrences similar to the      one here inquired into, the Committee can find no guarantee      elsewhere for the security of peace between the States of the      Union.\"    On February 2, 1860, the author submitted, in the Senate of the United  States, a series of resolutions, afterward slightly modified to read as  follows        \"1. _Resolved_, That, in the adoption of the Federal      Constitution, the States, adopting the same, acted severally as      free and independent sovereignties, delegating a portion of      their powers to be exercised by the Federal Government for the      increased security of each against dangers, _domestic_ as well      as foreign; and that any intermeddling by any one or more      States, or by a combination of their citizens, with the domestic      institutions of the others, on any pretext whatever, political,      moral, or religious, with the view to their disturbance or      subversion, is in violation of the Constitution, insulting to      the States so interfered with, endangers their domestic peace      and tranquillity--objects for which the Constitution was      formed--and, by necessary consequence, tends to weaken and      destroy the Union itself.        \"2. _Resolved_, That negro slavery, as it exists in fifteen      States of this Union, composes an important portion of their      domestic institutions, inherited from our ancestors, and      existing at the adoption of the Constitution, by which it is      recognized as constituting an important element in the      apportionment of powers among the States, and that no change of      opinion or feeling on the part of the non-slaveholding States of      the Union in relation to this institution can justify them or      their citizens in open or covert attacks thereon, with a view to      its overthrow; and that all such attacks are in manifest      violation of the mutual and solemn pledge to protect and defend      each other, given by the States respectively, on entering into      the constitutional compact which formed the Union, and are a      manifest breach of faith and a violation of the most solemn      obligations.        \"3. _Resolved_, That the Union of these States rests on the      equality of rights and privileges among its members, and that it      is especially the duty of the Senate, which represents the      States in their sovereign capacity, to resist all attempts to      discriminate either in relation to persons or property in the      Territories, which are the common possessions of the United      States, so as to give advantages to the citizens of one State      which are not equally assured to those of every other State.        \"4. _Resolved_, That neither Congress nor a Territorial      Legislature, whether by direct legislation or legislation of an      indirect and unfriendly character, possesses power to annul or      impair the constitutional right of any citizen of the United      States to take his slave property into the common Territories,      and there hold and enjoy the same while the territorial      condition remains.        \"5. _Resolved_, That if experience should at any time prove that      the judiciary and executive authority do not possess means to      insure adequate protection to constitutional rights in a      Territory, and if the Territorial government shall fail or      refuse to provide the necessary remedies for that purpose, it      will be the duty of Congress to supply such deficiency.[14]        \"6. _Resolved_, That the inhabitants of a Territory of the      United States, when they rightfully form a Constitution to be      admitted as a State into the Union, may then, for the first      time, like the people of a State when forming a new      Constitution, decide for themselves whether slavery, as a      domestic institution, shall be maintained or prohibited within      their jurisdiction; and they shall be received into the Union      with or without slavery, as their Constitution may prescribe at      the time of their admission.        \"7. _Resolved_, That the provision of the Constitution for the      rendition of fugitives from service or labor, 'without the      adoption of which the Union could not have been formed,' and      that the laws of 1793 and 1850, which were enacted to secure its      execution, and the main features of which, being similar, bear      the impress of nearly seventy years of sanction by the highest      judicial authority, should be honestly and faithfully observed      and maintained by all who enjoy the benefits of our compact of      union; and that all acts of individuals or of State Legislatures      to defeat the purpose or nullify the requirements of that      provision, and the laws made in pursuance of it, are hostile in      character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in      their effect.\"[15]    After a protracted and earnest debate, these resolutions were adopted  _seriatim_, on the 24th and 25th of May, by a decided majority of the  Senate (varying from thirty-three to thirty-six yeas against from two to  twenty-one nays), the Democrats, both Northern and Southern, sustaining  them unitedly, with the exception of one adverse vote (that of Mr. Pugh,  of Ohio) on the fourth and sixth resolutions. The Republicans all voted  against them or refrained from voting at all, except that Mr. Teneyck,  of New Jersey, voted for the fifth and seventh of the series. Mr.  Douglas, the leader if not the author of \"popular sovereignty,\" was  absent on account of illness, and there were a few other absentees.    The conclusion of a speech, in reply to Mr. Douglas, a few days before  the vote was taken on these resolutions, is introduced here as the best  evidence of the position of the author at that period of excitement and  agitation:        Conclusion of Reply to Mr. Douglas, _May 17, 1860_.        \"Mr. President: I briefly and reluctantly referred, because the      subject had been introduced, to the attitude of Mississippi on a      former occasion. I will now as briefly say that in 1851, and in      1860, Mississippi was, and is, ready to make every concession      which it becomes her to make to the welfare and the safety of      the Union. If, on a former occasion, she hoped too much from      fraternity, the responsibility for her disappointment rests upon      those who failed to fulfill her expectations. She still clings      to the Government as our fathers formed it. She is ready to-day      and to-morrow, as in her past and though brief yet brilliant      history, to maintain that Government in all its power, and to      vindicate its honor with all the means she possesses. I say      brilliant history; for it was in the very morning of her      existence that her sons, on the plains of New Orleans, were      announced, in general orders, to have been the admiration of one      army and the wonder of the other. That we had a division in      relation to the measures enacted in 1850, is true; that the      Southern rights men became the minority in the election which      resulted, is true; but no figure of speech could warrant the      Senator in speaking of them as subdued--as coming to him or      anybody else for quarter. I deemed it offensive when it was      uttered, and the scorn with which I repelled it at the instant,      time has only softened to contempt. Our flag was never borne      from the field. We had carried it in the face of defeat, with a      knowledge that defeat awaited it; but scarcely had the smoke of      the battle passed away which proclaimed another victor, before      the general voice admitted that the field again was ours. I have      not seen a sagacious, reflecting man, who was cognizant of the      events as they transpired at the time, who does not say that,      within two weeks after the election, our party was in a      majority; and the next election which occurred showed that we      possessed the State beyond controversy. How we have wielded that      power it is not for me to say. I trust others may see      forbearance in our conduct--that, with a determination to insist      upon our constitutional rights, then and now, there is an      unwavering desire to maintain the Government, and to uphold the      Democratic party.        \"We believe now, as we have asserted on former occasions, that      the best hope for the perpetuity of our institutions depends      upon the cooeperation, the harmony, the zealous action, of the      Democratic party. We cling to that party from conviction that      its principles and its aims are those of truth and the country,      as we cling to the Union"]]]
