The Baha'is in the United States have just embarked on their second Seven  Year Plan; India is working hard on a Four and a half Year Plan; England  is straining every nerve to achieve, during the Six Year Plan the friends  have chosen for themselves, 19 assemblies. It is only right and proper  that such a vast and promising territory as Australia, New Zealand and  Tasmania represent, should likewise win for itself new laurels in the  Baha'i teaching field during the next few years! He therefore suggests you  choose, after surveying your own possibilities and soliciting suggestions  from the friends, certain immediate objectives, and then work unitedly  towards achieving them.    He assures you that he will offer special prayers on your behalf, that the  N.S.A. members and the Baha'is they represent, may speedily forge ahead,  and enter into a new era of development of the Faith in that distant but  promising land.    With warm Baha'i greetings,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The activities in which you are engaged, are the object of my fervent and  constant prayers. To teach the Faith, to stimulate the dispersal and  settlement of pioneers, to enable the existing groups to attain assembly  status, and to multiply, steadily and speedily, the number of groups in  Australia and New Zealand are the paramount tasks which demand the  constant attention, the prayerful consideration and the united and  vigorous collaboration of the believers, and particularly of their  national elected representatives. No sacrifice is too great to further  these manifold and noble aims and purposes. Effective measures,  unprecedented in scope, should be carefully and immediately devised,  proclaimed to the believers, and, through sustained and organised effort,  carried into effect. There is no time to lose. The masses, greatly tried  by the calamities of the age, restless, disappointed, and eager to obtain  real and complete relief in their hour of trial, hunger for the Message of  the new Day, and will, if properly approached and appealed to, embrace the  great verities it enshrines. Firm and unassailable unity among those who  profess to be its bearers, unshakeable fidelity to the principles on which  it is founded, generous and unfailing support of the institutions designed  to propagate it, are the vital prerequisites of their urgent and sacred  task. Every consideration, however profitable and laudable, must for the  present be subordinated to the vital needs of the strenuous task now  confronting the Australian and New Zealand Baha'i communities. The  administrative machinery designed to provide the necessary agency for the  diffusion of the Message has been sufficiently consolidated to enable it  to perform the glorious task for which it was originally erected. It  should be utilised to the fullest possible extent. Its scope should  simultaneously be enlarged to provide a still wider basis for the future  extension of teaching activities. May the coming year witness a notable  advance in the organized activities of the community for the furtherance  of so glorious and meritorious a purpose.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JULY 16TH, 1946      Haifa, July 16th, 1946.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letter of June 20th has been received, and our beloved Guardian has  instructed me to answer it on his behalf, also to acknowledge receipt of  its enclosures.    He was very glad to see that amongst the actions taken by the N.S.A. at  its recent meeting was to allot sums to the Regional Teaching Committees  for them to carry on active teaching campaigns and finance travelling  teachers and settlers--if possible. He considers this all very important,  and he urges you to appeal to the Baha'is to arise and do pioneer work as  their fellow-believers are doing in England, India, Egypt and America.    He also feels that, if the N.S.A. considers such a course of action  feasible, definite plans should be made for carrying the Cause to certain  goal towns; in other words, a real plan with fixed objectives and a time  limit is now possible for Australia, and should be speedily set in motion.    Likewise, he feels that the N.S.A. should meet more often, even if all  members cannot always be present. Decisions by correspondence lack the  vitality of those that arise out of active consultation, and now the Faith  is progressing so well there, and has a sound administrative foundation,  more vigorous and systematic action is required.    You may be sure all the members of the assembly are remembered in his  prayers, and he is supplicating for their guidance and success in the  discharge of their sacred duties.    With loving greetings,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The ever-expanding activities of the Baha'i communities of Australia and  New Zealand, so clearly reflected in the reports and minutes forwarded  recently by your Assembly, demonstrate the character of the Faith which so  powerfully animates you, testify to the loyalty, the vigour and the  devotion with which you conduct the affairs of a continually growing  Faith, proclaim the soundness of the foundation upon which you are rearing  its institutions, and augur well for their future evolution and triumph.  The attention of the believers throughout all centres in both communities  should now be focussed on the steady multiplication and consolidation of  these institutions which constitute the bedrock of the Administrative  Order of which your Assembly is the appointed trustee and chief promoter.  No sacrifice is too great for the promotion of such an urgent and vital  task. A supreme effort, on the part of all, young and old alike,  individuals, assemblies and communities, is absolutely essential in the  course of the present year, and as a prelude to the initiation of future  plans aiming at a still greater development and further enrichment of the  life of both communities. All secondary matters should be subordinated to  the primary requirements of the present day. The futherance of this noble  objective should be made the object of the anxious and sustained  deliberations of your Assembly. The resources of both communities should  be devoted to such a purpose. Nothing should be allowed to deflect them  from this course. If they persevere the blessings of the Almighty will  enable them to achieve exploits far exceeding their fondest expectations.  That they may be graciously aided, in their labours, by Baha'u'llah is my  fervent hope and prayer. I feel confident that they will respond to my  plea, and arise unitedly to achieve their immediate goal.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JULY 31ST, 1946      Haifa, July 31st, 1946    Dear Baha'i Brother:    Your letter--with check enclosed--dated 15th of July was received and our  beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.    He is very sorry that from here he is unable owing to existing  regulations, to forward this loving contribution made by both the  believers and the N.S.A. to Persia for the Relief Fund. He suggests you  try to send it direct to Tehran to the treasurer of this Fund, Mr. Varga.  If you are able to do so, and will arrange to send the money to Mr. Daoud  Toeq, he will see it reaches Mr. Varga in Tehran.    Please assure the members of the N.S.A., and all the friends, of his deep  appreciation of this gift to their sorely tried brethren in other lands.    You may be sure he often prays for the success of your work and that of  all the N.S.A. members.    With loving greetings,  R. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Assuring you of my loving prayers for the success of your efforts in the  service of our beloved Faith and of its divinely appointed insitutions,    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MARCH 14TH, 1947      March 14th, 1947.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated Sep.  2nd and 16th, and Oct. 22nd and 25th, 1946, and to acknowledge receipt of  enclosures sent in some of them, and also material forwarded under  separate cover. He regrets very much the delay in replying to these N.S.A.  communications, but he has been very preoccupied with various pressing  matters the last few months, and his mail has consequently had to wait.    In regard to the various points you raised in your letters: There is no  objection to individual Baha'is sending Naw-Ruz cards if they want to;  also the N.S.A. can send them out occassionally, but it should not become  a fixed custom.    He has already cabled you that he approves of increasing the delegates to  the Annual Convention to 19.    He feels that Committees should be left free to elect their own officers.    Prayers translated by other people may be used and memorized by the  friends; they need not be confined to his translations.    He considers that the N.S.A. has every right to examine the ballots if  there is some doubt as to the election having been properly conducted. By  \"preservation\" of the ballots is meant that they are preserved in the  National files.    A Convention delegate should certainly be given an opportunity to report  to the community his or her experiences at Convention and impressions.    As to the whole matter of the incorporation of assemblies: he cannot go  into the details of such things, as this is the work of the N.S.A. What he  wants is that the spiritual assemblies in New Zealand and Australia should  be legally empowered to hold property in their own names; how this can be  done, the best way of doing it, are matters for your Assembly and its  legal advisers to decide.    He feels very strongly that the main thing for your Assembly and all the  believers of both Australia and New Zealand to concentrate on are teaching  plans. The United States, India, Persia and England are all embarked on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#14)"],[1,"repudiation, on the  part of the Babis, of any intention of interfering with the civil  jurisdiction of the realm, or of undermining the legitimate authority of  its sovereign. It provided a no less convincing testimony to the restraint  and forbearance of the victims, in the face of the ruthless and unprovoked  aggression of the oppressor. It exposed, as it moved toward its climax,  and in hardly less striking a manner, the cowardice, the want of  discipline and the degradation of a spiritually bankrupt foe. It was  marked, as it approached its conclusion, by a treachery as vile and  shameful. It ended in a massacre even more revolting in the horrors it  evoked and the miseries it engendered. It sealed the fate of Vahid who, by  his green turban, the emblem of his proud lineage, was bound to a horse  and dragged ignominiously through the streets, after which his head was  cut off, was stuffed with straw, and sent as a trophy to the feasting  Prince in _Sh_iraz, while his body was abandoned to the mercy of the  infuriated women of Nayriz, who, intoxicated with barbarous joy by the  shouts of exultation raised by a triumphant enemy, danced, to the  accompaniment of drums and cymbals, around it. And finally, it brought in  its wake, with the aid of no less than five thousand men, specially  commissioned for this purpose, a general and fierce onslaught on the  defenseless Babis, whose possessions were confiscated, whose houses were  destroyed, whose stronghold was burned to the ground, whose women and  children were captured, and some of whom, stripped almost naked, were  mounted on donkeys, mules and camels, and led through rows of heads hewn  from the lifeless bodies of their fathers, brothers, sons and husbands,  who previously had been either branded, or had their nails torn out, or  had been lashed to death, or had spikes hammered into their hands and  feet, or had incisions made in their noses through which strings were  passed, and by which they were led through the streets before the gaze of  an irate and derisive multitude.    This turmoil, so ravaging, so distressing, had hardly subsided when  another conflagration, even more devastating than the two previous  upheavals, was kindled in Zanjan and its immediate surroundings.  Unprecedented in both its duration and in the number of those who were  swept away by its fury, this violent tempest that broke out in the west of  Persia, and in which Mulla Muhammad-'Aliy-i-Zanjani, surnamed Hujjat, one  of the ablest and most formidable champions of the Faith, together with no  less than eighteen hundred of his fellow-disciples, drained the cup of  martyrdom, defined more sharply than ever the unbridgeable gulf that  separated the torchbearers of the newborn Faith from the civil and  ecclesiastical exponents of a gravely shaken Order. The chief figures  mainly responsible for, and immediately concerned with, this ghastly  tragedy were the envious and hypocritical Amir Arslan _Kh_an, the  Majdu'd-Dawlih, a maternal uncle of Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah, and his  associates, the Sadru'd-Dawliy-i-Isfahani and Muhammad _Kh_an, the  Amir-Tuman, who were assisted, on the one hand, by substantial military  reinforcements dispatched by order of the Amir-Nizam, and aided, on the  other, by the enthusiastic moral support of the entire ecclesiastical body  in Zanjan. The spot that became the theatre of heroic exertions, the scene  of intense sufferings, and the target for furious and repeated assaults,  was the Fort of 'Ali-Mardan _Kh_an, which at one time sheltered no less  than three thousand Babis, including men, women and children, the tale of  whose agonies is unsurpassed in the annals of a whole century.    A brief reference to certain outstanding features of this mournful  episode, endowing the Faith, in its infancy, with measureless  potentialities, will suffice to reveal its distinctive character. The  pathetic scenes following upon the division of the inhabitants of Zanjan  into two distinct camps, by the order of its governor--a decision  dramatically proclaimed by a crier, and which dissolved ties of worldly  interest and affection in favor of a mightier loyalty; the reiterated  exhortations addressed by Hujjat to the besieged to refrain from  aggression and acts of violence; his affirmation, as he recalled the  tragedy of Mazindaran, that their victory consisted solely in sacrificing  their all on the altar of the Cause of the Sahibu'z-Zaman, and his  declaration of the unalterable intention of his companions to serve their  sovereign loyally and to be the well-wishers of his people; the astounding  intrepidity with which these same companions repelled the ferocious  onslaught launched by the Sadru'd-Dawlih, who eventually was obliged to  confess his abject failure, was reprimanded by the _Sh_ah and was degraded  from his rank; the contempt with which the occupants of the Fort met the  appeals of the crier seeking on behalf of an exasperated enemy to inveigle  them into renouncing their Cause and to beguile them by the generous  offers and promises of the sovereign; the resourcefulness and incredible  audacity of Zaynab, a village maiden, who, fired with an irrepressible  yearning to throw in her lot with the defenders of the Fort, disguised  herself in male attire, cut off her locks, girt a sword about her waist,  and, raising the cry of Ya Sahibu'z-Zaman!\" rushed headlong in pursuit of  the assailants, and who, disdainful of food and sleep, continued, during a  period of five months, in the thick of the turmoil, to animate the zeal  and to rush to the rescue of her men companions; the stupendous uproar  raised by the guards who manned the barricades as they shouted the five  invocations prescribed by the Bab, on the very night on which His  instructions had been received--an uproar which precipitated the death of a  few persons in the camp of the enemy, caused the dissolute officers to  drop instantly their wine-glasses to the ground and to overthrow the  gambling-tables, and hurry forth bare-footed, and induced others to run  half-dressed into the wilderness, or flee panic-stricken to the homes of  the 'ulamas--these stand out as the high lights of this bloody contest. We  recall, likewise, the contrast between the disorder, the cursing, the  ribald laughter, the debauchery and shame that characterized the camp of  the enemy, and the atmosphere of reverent devotion that filled the Fort,  from which anthems of praise and hymns of joy were continually ascending.  Nor can we fail to note the appeal addressed by Hujjat and his chief  supporters to the _Sh_ah, repudiating the malicious assertions of their  foes, assuring him of their loyalty to him and his government, and of  their readiness to establish in his presence the soundness of their Cause;  the interception of these messages by the governor and the substitution by  him of forged letters loaded with abuse which he dispatched in their stead  to Tihran; the enthusiastic support extended by the female occupants of  the Fort, the shouts of exultation which they raised, the eagerness with  which some of them, disguised in the garb of men, rushed to reinforce its  defences and to supplant their fallen brethren, while others ministered to  the sick, and carried on their shoulders skins of water for the wounded,  and still others, like the Carthaginian women of old, cut off their long  hair and bound the thick coils around the guns to reinforce them; the foul  treachery of the besiegers, who, on the very day they had drawn up and  written out an appeal for peace and, enclosing with it a sealed copy of  the Qur'an as a testimony of their pledge, had sent it to Hujjat, did not  shrink from throwing into a dungeon the members of the delegation,  including the children, which had been sent by him to treat with them,  from tearing out the beard of the venerated leader of that delegation, and  from savagely mutilating one of his fellow-disciples. We call to mind,  moreover, the magnanimity of Hujjat who, though afflicted with the sudden  loss of both his wife and child, continued with unruffled calm in  exhorting his companions to exercise forbearance and to resign themselves  to the will of God, until he himself succumbed to a wound he had received  from the enemy; the barbarous revenge which an adversary incomparably  superior in numbers and equipment wreaked upon its victims, giving them  over to a massacre and pillage, unexampled in scope and ferocity, in which  a rapacious army, a greedy populace and an unappeasable clergy freely  indulged; the exposure of the captives, of either sex, hungry and  ill-clad, during no less than fifteen days and nights, to the biting cold  of an exceptionally severe winter, while crowds of women danced merrily  around them, spat in their faces and insulted them with the foulest  invectives; the savage cruelty that condemned others to be blown from  guns, to be plunged into ice-cold water and lashed severely, to have their  skulls soaked in boiling oil, to be smeared with treacle and left to  perish in the snow; and finally, the insatiable hatred that impelled the  crafty governor to induce through his insinuations the seven year old son  of Hujjat to disclose the burial-place of his father, that drove him to  violate the grave, disinter the corpse, order it to be dragged to the  sound of drums and trumpets through the streets of Zanjan, and be exposed,  for three days and three nights, to unspeakable injuries. These, and other  similar incidents connected with the epic story of the Zanjan upheaval,  characterized by Lord Curzon as a \"terrific siege and slaughter,\" combine  to invest it with a sombre glory unsurpassed by any episode of a like  nature in the records of the Heroic Age of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.    To the tide of calamity which, during the concluding years of the Bab's  ministry, was sweeping with such ominous fury the provinces of Persia,  whether in the East, in the"]]]
