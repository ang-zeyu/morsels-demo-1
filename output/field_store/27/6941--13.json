Shen-Yan we knew to be  a creature of the Chinese doctor, and only a most urgent call had  prevented me from joining Smith upon this promising, though hazardous  expedition.    At any rate, Fate willing it so, he had gone without me; and  now--although Inspector Weymouth, assisted by a number of C.I.D. men,  was sweeping the district about me--to the time of my departure  nothing whatever had been heard of Smith. The ordeal of waiting  finally had proved too great to be borne. With no definite idea of  what I proposed to do, I had thrown myself into the search, filled  with such dreadful apprehensions as I hope never again to experience.    I did not know the exact situation of the place to which Smith was  gone, for owing to the urgent case which I have mentioned, I had been  absent at the time of his departure; nor could Scotland Yard enlighten  me upon this point. Weymouth was in charge of the case--under Smith's  direction--and since the inspector had left the Yard, early that  morning, he had disappeared as completely as Smith, no report having  been received from him.    As my driver turned into the black mouth of a narrow, ill-lighted  street, and the glare and clamour of the greater thoroughfare died  behind me, I sank into the corner of the cab burdened with such a  sense of desolation as mercifully comes but rarely.    We were heading now for that strange settlement off the West India  Dock Road, which, bounded by Limehouse Causeway and Pennyfields, and  narrowly confined within four streets, composes an unique Chinatown, a  miniature of that at Liverpool, and of the greater one in San  Francisco. Inspired with an idea which promised hopefully, I raised  the speaking-tube:    \"Take me first to the River Police Station,\" I directed; \"along  Ratcliffe Highway.\"    The man turned and nodded comprehendingly, as I could see through the  wet pane.    Presently we swerved to the right and into an even narrower street.  This inclined in an easterly direction, and proved to communicate with  a wide thoroughfare along which passed brilliantly lighted electric  trams. I had lost all sense of direction, and when, swinging to the  left and to the right again, I looked through the window and perceived  that we were before the door of the Police Station, I was dully  surprised.    In quite mechanical fashion I entered the depot. Inspector Ryman, our  associate in one of the darkest episodes of the campaign with the  Yellow Doctor two years before, received me in his office.    By a negative shake of the head, he answered my unspoken question.    \"The ten o'clock boat is lying off the Stone Stairs, doctor,\" he said,  \"and co-operating with some of the Scotland Yard men who are dragging  that district--\"    I shuddered at the word \"dragging\"; Ryman had not used it literally, but  nevertheless it had conjured up a dread possibility--a possibility in  accordance with the methods of Dr. Fu-Manchu. All within space of an  instant I saw the tide of Limehouse Reach, the Thames lapping about the  green-coated timbers of a dock pier; and rising--falling--sometimes  disclosing to the pallid light a rigid hand, sometimes a horribly  bloated face--I saw the body of Nayland Smith at the mercy of those oily  waters. Ryman continued:    \"There is a launch out, too, patrolling the riverside from here to  Tilbury. Another lies at the breakwater.\" He jerked his thumb over his  shoulder. \"Should you care to take a run down and see for yourself?\"    \"No, thanks,\" I replied, shaking my head. \"You are doing all that can  be done. Can you give me the address of the place to which Mr. Smith  went last night?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Ryman; \"I thought you knew it. You remember  Shen-Yan's place--by Limehouse Basin? Well, farther east--east of the  Causeway, between Gill Street and Three Colt Street--is a block of  wooden buildings. You recall them?\"    \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Is the man established there again, then?\"    \"It appears so, but although you have evidently not been informed of  the fact, Weymouth raided the establishment in the early hours of this  morning!\"    \"Well?\" I cried.    \"Unfortunately with no result,\" continued the inspector. \"The  notorious Shen-Yan was missing, and although there is no real doubt  that the place is used as a gaming-house, not a particle of evidence  to that effect could be obtained. Also--there was no sign of Mr.  Nayland Smith, and no sign of the American Burke, who had led him to  the place.\"    \"Is it certain that they went there?\"    \"Two C.I.D. men, who were shadowing, actually saw the pair of them  enter. A signal had been arranged, but it was never given; and at  about half-past four the place was raided.\"    \"Surely some arrests were made?\"    \"But there was no evidence!\" cried Ryman. \"Every inch of the  rat-burrow was searched. The Chinese gentleman who posed as the  proprietor of what he claimed to be a respectable lodging-house,  offered every facility to the police. What could we do?\"    \"I take it that the place is being watched?\"    \"Certainly,\" said Ryman. \"Both from the river and from the shore. Oh!  they are not there! God knows where they are, but they are not  _there_!\"    I stood for a moment in silence, endeavouring to determine my course;  then, telling Ryman that I hoped to see him later, I walked out slowly  into the rain and mist, and nodding to the taxi-driver to proceed to  our original destination, I re-entered the cab.    As we moved off, the lights of the River Police depot were swallowed  up in the humid murk, and again I found myself being carried through  the darkness of those narrow streets, which, like a maze, hold secret  within their Labyrinth mysteries great, and at least as foul, as that  of Parsiphae.    The marketing centres I had left far behind me; to my right stretched  the broken range of riverside buildings, and beyond them flowed the  Thames, a stream heavily burdened with secrets as ever were Tiber or  Tigris. On my left, occasional flickering lights broke through the  mist, for the most part the lights of taverns; and saving these rents  in the veil, the darkness was punctuated with nothing but the faint  and yellow luminance of the street lamps.    Ahead was a black mouth, which promised to swallow me up as it had  swallowed up my friend.    In short, what with my lowered condition, and consequent frame of  mind, and what with the traditions, for me inseparable from that  gloomy quarter of London, I was in the grip of a shadowy menace which  at any moment might become tangible--I perceived, in the most  commonplace objects, the yellow hand of Dr. Fu-Manchu.    When the cab stopped in a place of utter darkness, I aroused myself  with an effort, opened the door, and stepped out into the mud of a  narrow lane. A high brick wall frowned upon me from one side, and,  dimly perceptible, there towered a smoke stack beyond. On my right  uprose the side of a wharf building, shadowly, and some distance  ahead, almost obscured by the drizzling rain, a solitary lamp  flickered.    I turned up the collar of my raincoat, shivering, as much at the  prospect as from physical chill.    \"You will wait here,\" I said to the man; and, feeling in my  breast-pocket, I added: \"If you hear the note of a whistle, drive on  and rejoin me.\"    He listened attentively and with a certain eagerness. I had selected  him that night for the reason that he had driven Smith and myself on  previous occasions and had proved himself a man of intelligence.  Transferring a Browning pistol from my hip-pocket to that of my  raincoat, I trudged on into the mist.    The headlights of the taxi were swallowed up behind me, and just  abreast of the street lamp I stood listening.    Save for the dismal sound of rain, and the trickling of water along  the gutters, all about me was silent. Sometimes this silence would be  broken by the distant, muffled note of a steam siren; and always,  forming a sort of background to the near stillness, was the remote din  of riverside activity.    I walked on to the corner just beyond the lamp. This was the street in  which the wooden buildings were situated. I had expected to detect  some evidences of surveillance, but if any were indeed being observed,  it was effectively masked. Not a living creature was visible, peer as  I would.    Plans I had none, and perceiving that the street was empty, and that  no lights showed in any of the windows, I passed on, only to find that  I had entered a cul-de-sac.    A rickety gate gave access to a descending flight of stone steps, the  bottom invisible in the denser shadows of an archway, beyond which, I  doubted not, lay the river.    Still uninspired by any definite design, I tried the gate and found  that it was unlocked. Like some wandering soul, as it has since seemed  to me, I descended. There was a lamp over the archway, but the glass  was broken, and the rain apparently had extinguished the light; as I  passed under it, I could hear the gas whistling from the burner.    Continuing my way, I found myself upon a narrow wharf with the Thames  flowing gloomily beneath me. A sort of fog hung over the river,  shutting me in. Then came an incident.    Suddenly, quite near, there arose a weird and mournful cry--a cry  indescribable, and inexpressibly uncanny!    I started back so violently that how I escaped falling into the river  I do not know to this day. That cry, so eerie and so wholly  unexpected, had unnerved me; and realizing the nature of my  surroundings, and the folly of my presence alone in such a place, I  began to edge back towards the foot of the steps, away from the thing  that cried; when--a great white shape uprose like a phantom before  me!...    There are few men, I suppose, whose lives have been crowded with so  many eerie happenings as mine, but this phantom thing which grew out  of the darkness, which seemed about to envelop me, takes rank in my  memory amongst the most"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#14)"],[1,"powers  of Lurgha, and the Mother will be well pleased with you. But you shall  say nothing to the men of the village, for this quarrel is between  Lurgha and Assha now and not for the meddling of others.\"    He unfastened the rope which bound Lal's arms. Lal reached out a hand to  the wolf skin, his eyes filled with wonderment. \"This is a fine thing  you give me, Assha, and the Mother will be pleased, for in many years  she has not had such a curtain for her secret place. Also, I am but a  little man; the quarrels of great ones are not for me. Since Lurgha has  accepted your words this is none of my affair. Yet I will not go back to  the village for a while--with your permission, Assha. For I am a man of  loose and wagging tongue and oftentimes I speak what I do not really  wish to say. So if I am asked questions, I answer. If I am not there to  be asked such questions, I cannot answer.\"    McNeil laughed, and Ashe smiled. \"Well enough, Lal. Perhaps you are a  wiser man than you think. But also I do not believe you should stay  here.\"    The tribesman was already nodding. \"That do I say, too, Assha. You are  now facing the Wrath of Lurgha, and with that I wish no part. Thus I  shall go into the marsh for a while. There are birds and hares to hunt,  and I shall work upon this fine skin so that when I take it to the  Mother it shall indeed be a gift worth her smiles. Now, Assha, I would  go before the night comes if it pleases you.\"    \"Go with good fortune, Lal.\" Ashe stood apart while the tribesman ducked  his head in a shy, awkward farewell to the others, pattering out into  the valley.    \"What if they pick him up?\" McNeil asked wearily.    \"I don't think they can,\" Ashe returned. \"And what would you do--keep  him here? If we tried that, he'd scheme to escape and try to turn the  tables on us. Now he'll keep away from Nodren's village and out of sight  for the time being. Lal's not too bright in some ways, but he's a good  hunter. If he has reason for hiding out, it'll take a better hunter to  track him. At least we know now that the Reds are afraid they did not  make a clean sweep here. What happened, McNeil?\"    While he was telling his story in more detail both Ashe and Ross worked  on his burns, making him comfortable. Then Ashe sat back as Ross  prepared food.    \"How did they spot the post?\" Ashe rubbed his chin and frowned at the  fire.    \"Only way I can guess is that they picked up our post signal and  pinpointed the source. That means they must have been hunting us for  some time.\"    \"No strangers about lately?\"    McNeil shook his head. \"Our cover wasn't broken that way. Sanford was a  wonder. If I hadn't known better, I would have sworn he was born one of  the Beaker folk. He had a network of informants running all the way from  here into Brittany. Amazing how he was able to work without arousing any  suspicions. I suppose his being a member of the smiths' guild was a big  help. He could pick up a lot of news from any village where there was  one at work. And I tell you,\" McNeil propped himself up on his elbow to  exclaim more vehemently--\"there wasn't a whisper of trouble from here  clear across the channel and pretty far to the north. We were already  sure the south was clean before we ever took cover as Beakers,  especially since their clans are thick in Spain.\"    Ashe chewed a broiled wing reflectively. \"Their permanent base with the  transport _has_ to be somewhere within the bounds of the territory they  hold in our own time.\"    \"They could plant it in Siberia and laugh at us,\" McNeil exploded. \"No  hope of our getting in there----\"    \"No.\" Ashe threw the stripped bone into the fire and licked grease from  his fingers. \"Then they would be faced with the old problem of distance.  If what they are exploiting lay within their modern boundaries, we would  never have tumbled to the thing in the first place. What the Reds want  must lie outside their twentieth century holdings, a slender point in  our favor. Therefore they will plant their shift point as close to it as  they can. Our transportation problem is more difficult than theirs will  ever be.    \"You know why we chose the arctic for our base; it lies in a section of  the world never populated by other than roving hunters. But I'll wager  anything you want to name that their point is somewhere in Europe where  they have people to contend with. If they are using a plane, they can't  risk its being seen----\"    \"I don't see why not,\" Ross broke in. \"These people couldn't possibly  know what it was--Lurgha's bird--magic--\"    Ashe shook his head. \"They must have the interference-with-history worry  as much as we have. Anything of our own time has to be hidden or  disguised in such a way that the native who may stumble upon it will  never know it is man-made. Our sub is a whale to all appearances.  Possibly their plane is a bird, but neither can bear too close an  examination. We don't know what could result from a leak of real  knowledge in this or any primitive time ... how it might change  history----\"    \"But,\" Ross advanced what he believed to be the best argument against  that reasoning, \"suppose I handed Lal a gun and taught him to use it. He  couldn't duplicate the weapon--the technology required lies so far  beyond this age. These people couldn't reproduce such a thing.\"    \"True enough. On the other hand, don't belittle the ingenuity of the  smiths or the native intelligence of men in any era. These tribesmen  might not be able to reproduce your gun, but it would set them thinking  along new lines. We might find that they would think our time right out  of being. No, we dare not play tricks with the past. This is the same  situation we faced immediately after the discovery of the atom bomb.  Everybody raced to produce that new weapon and then sat around and  shivered for fear we'd be crazy enough to use it on each other.    \"The Reds have made new discoveries which we have to match, or we will  go under. But back in time we have to be careful, both of us, or perhaps  destroy the world we do live in.\"    \"What do we do now?\" McNeil wanted to know.    \"Murdock and I came here only for a trial run. It's his test. The sub is  to call for us about nine days from now.\"    \"So if we sit tight--if we _can_ sit tight--\" McNeil lay down  again--\"they will take us out. Meanwhile we have nine days.\"    They spent three more days in the cave. McNeil was on his feet and  impatient to leave before Ashe was able to hobble well enough to travel.  Though Ross and McNeil took turns at hunting and guard duty, they saw no  signs that the tribesmen were tracking them. Apparently Lal had done as  he promised, withdrawing to the marsh and hiding there apart from his  people.    In the gray of pre-dawn on the fourth day Ashe wakened Ross. Their fire  had been buried with earth, and already the cave seemed bleak. They ate  venison roasted the night before and went out into the chill of a fog. A  little way down the valley McNeil joined them out of the mist from his  guard post. Keeping their pace to one which favored Ashe's healing  wound, they made their way inland in the direction of the track linking  the villages.    Crossing that road they continued northward, the land beginning to rise  under them. Far away they heard the blatting of sheep, the bark of a  dog. In the fog, Ross stumbled in a shallow ditch beyond which lay a  stubbled field. Ashe paused to look about him, his nostrils expanding as  if he were a hound smelling out their trail.    The three went on, crossing a whole series of small, irregular fields.  Ross was sure that the yield from any of these cleared strips must be  scanty. The fog was thickening. Ashe pressed the pace, using his  handmade crutch carefully. He gave an audible sigh of relief when they  were faced at last by two stone monoliths rising like pillars. A third  stone lay across them, forming a rude arch through which they saw a  narrow valley running back into the hills.    Through the fog Ross could sense the eerie strangeness of the valley  beyond the massive gate. He would have said that he was not  superstitious, that he had merely studied these tribal beliefs as  lessons; he had not accepted them. Yet now, if he had been alone, he  would have avoided that place and turned aside from the valley, for that  which waited within was not for him. To his secret relief Ashe paused by  the arch to wait.    The older man gestured the other two into cover. Ross obeyed willingly,  though the dank drops of condensing fog dripped on his cloak and wet his  face as he brushed against prickly-leafed shrubs. Here were walls of  evergreen plants and dwarfed pines almost as if this tunnel of  year-round greenery had been planted with some purpose in mind. Once his  companions had concealed themselves, Ashe called, shrill but sweetly,  with a bird's rising notes. Three times he made that sound before a  figure moved in the fog, the rough gray-white of its long cloak melting  in the wisps of mist.    Down that green tunnel, out of the heart of the valley, the other came,  a loop of cloak concealing the entire figure. It halted right in back of  the arch and Ashe, making a gesture to the others to stay where they  were, faced the muffled stranger.    \"Hands and feet of the Mother, she who sows what may be reaped----\"    \"Outland stranger who is under the Wrath of Lurgha,\" the other mocked  him in the voice of Cassca. \"What do you want, outlander, that you dare  to come here where no man may enter?\"    \"That which you know. For on the night when Lurgha came you also  saw----\"    Ross heard the hiss of a sharply drawn breath. \"How knew you that,  outlander?\"    \"Because you serve the Mother and you are jealous for her and her  service. If Lurgha is a mighty god, you wanted to see his acts with your  own eyes.\"    When she finally answered, there was anger as well as frustration in her  voice. \"And you know of my shame then, Assha. For "]]]
