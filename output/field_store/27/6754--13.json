Bush said he went to the well but did not go near the house,  and did not assault the woman. After he was arrested the alleged victim  did not see him to identify him--he was presumed to be guilty.    The citizens determined to kill him. The mob gathered, went to the jail,  met with no resistance, took the suspected man, dragged him out tearing  every stitch of clothing from his body, then hanged him to a telegraph  pole. The grand jury refused to indict the lynchers though the names of  over twenty persons who were leaders in the mob were well known. In fact  twenty-two persons were indicted, but the grand jurors and the prosecuting  attorney disagreed as to the form of the indictments, which caused the  jurors to change their minds. All indictments were reconsidered and the  matter was dropped. Not one of the dozens of men prominent in that murder  have suffered a whit more inconvenience for the butchery of that man, than  they would have suffered for shooting a dog.      COLOR LINE JUSTICE    In Baltimore, Maryland, a gang of white ruffians assaulted a respectable  colored girl who was out walking with a young man of her own race. They  held her escort and outraged the girl. It was a deed dastardly enough to  arouse Southern blood, which gives its horror of rape as excuse for  lawlessness, but she was a colored woman. The case went to the courts and  they were acquitted.    In Nashville, Tennessee, there was a white man, Pat Hanifan, who outraged  a little colored girl, and from the physical injuries received she was  ruined for life. He was jailed for six months, discharged, and is now a  detective in that city. In the same city, last May, a white man outraged a  colored girl in a drug store. He was arrested and released on bail at the  trial. It was rumored that five hundred colored men had organized to lynch  him. Two hundred and fifty white citizens armed themselves with  Winchesters and guarded him. A cannon was placed in front of his home, and  the Buchanan Rifles (State Militia) ordered to the scene for his  protection. The colored mob did not show up. Only two weeks before, Eph.  Grizzard, who had only been charged with rape upon a white woman, had been  taken from the jail, with Governor Buchanan and the police and militia  standing by, dragged through the streets in broad daylight, knives plunged  into him at every step, and with every fiendish cruelty that a frenzied  mob could devise, he was at last swung out on the bridge with hands cut to  pieces as he tried to climb up the stanchions. A naked, bloody example of  the bloodthirstiness of the nineteenth-century civilization of the Athens  of the South! No cannon nor military were called out in his defense. He  dared to visit a white woman.    At the very moment when these civilized whites were announcing their  determination \"to protect their wives and daughters,\" by murdering  Grizzard, a white man was in the same jail for raping eight-year-old  Maggie Reese, a colored girl. He was not harmed. The \"honor\" of grown  women who were glad enough to be supported by the Grizzard boys and Ed.  Coy, as long as the liaison was not known, needed protection; they were  white. The outrage upon helpless childhood needed no avenging in this  case; she was black.    A white man in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory, two months after inflicted  such injuries upon another colored girl that she died. He was not  punished, but an attempt was made in the same town in the month of June to  lynch a colored man who visited a white woman.    In Memphis, Tennessee, in the month of June, Ellerton L. Dorr, who is the  husband of Russell Hancock's widow, was arrested for attempted rape on  Mattie Cole, a neighbor's cook; he was only prevented from accomplishing  his purpose by the appearance of Mattie's employer. Dorr's friends say he  was drunk and, not responsible for his actions. The grand jury refused to  indict him and he was discharged.    In Tallahassee, Florida, a colored girl, Charlotte Gilliam, was assaulted  by white men. Her father went to have a warrant for their arrest issued,  but the judge refused to issue it.    In Bowling Green, Virginia, Moses Christopher, a colored lad, was charged  with assault, September 10. He was indicted, tried, convicted and  sentenced to death in one day. In the same state at Danville, two weeks  before--August 29, Thomas J. Penn, a white man, committed a criminal  assault upon Lina Hanna, a twelve-year-old colored girl, but he has not  been tried, certainly not killed either by the law or the mob.    In Surrey county, Virginia, C.L. Brock, a white man, criminally assaulted  a ten-year-old colored girl, and threatened to kill her if she told.  Notwithstanding, she confessed to her aunt, Mrs. Alice Bates, and the  white brute added further crime by killing Mrs. Bates when she upbraided  him about his crime upon her niece. He emptied the contents of his  revolver into her body as she lay. Brock has never been apprehended, and  no effort has been made to do so by the legal authorities.    But even when punishment is meted out by law to white villians for this  horrible crime, it is seldom or never that capital punishment is invoked.  Two cases just clipped from the daily papers will suffice to show how this  crime is punished when committed by white offenders and black.    LOUISVILLE, KY., October 19.--Smith Young, colored, was today sentenced to  be hanged. Young criminally assaulted a six-year-old child about six  months ago.    Jacques Blucher, the Pontiac Frenchman who was arrested at that place for  a criminal assault on his daughter Fanny on July 29 last, pleaded nolo  contendere when placed on trial at East Greenwich, near Providence, R.I.,  Tuesday, and was sentenced to five years in State Prison.    Charles Wilson was convicted of assault upon seven-year-old Mamie Keys in  Philadelphia, in October, and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was  white. Indianapolis courts sentenced a white man in September to eight  years in prison for assault upon a twelve-year-old white girl.    April 24, 1893, a lynching was set for Denmark, S.C., on the charge of  rape. A white girl accused a Negro of assault, and the mob was about to  lynch him. A few hours before the lynching three reputable white men rode  into the town and solemnly testified that the accused Negro was at work  with them 25 miles away on the day and at the hour the crime had been  committed. He was accordingly set free. A white person's word is taken as  absolutely for as against a Negro.          7    THE CRUSADE JUSTIFIED    _(Appeal from America to the World_)      It has been urged in criticism of the movement appealing to the English  people for sympathy and support in our crusade against Lynch Law that our  action was unpatriotic, vindictive and useless. It is not a part of the  plan of this pamphlet to make any defense for that crusade nor to indict  any apology for the motives which led to the presentation of the facts of  American lynchings to the world at large. To those who are not willfully  blind and unjustly critical, the record of more than a thousand lynchings  in ten years is enough to justify any peaceable movement tending to  ameliorate the conditions which led to this unprecedented slaughter of  human beings.    If America would not hear the cry of men, women and children whose dying  groans ascended to heaven praying for relief, not only for them but for  others who might soon be treated as they, then certainly no fair-minded  person can charge disloyalty to those who make an appeal to the  civilization of the world for such sympathy and help as it is possible to  extend. If stating the facts of these lynchings, as they appeared from  time to time in the white newspapers of America--the news gathered by  white correspondents, compiled by white press bureaus and disseminated  among white people--shows any vindictiveness, then the mind which so  charges is not amenable to argument.    But it is the desire of this pamphlet to urge that the crusade started and  thus far continued has not been useless, but has been blessed with the  most salutary results. The many evidences of the good results can not here  be mentioned, but the thoughtful student of the situation can himself  find ample proof. There need not here be mentioned the fact that for the  first time since lynching began, has there been any occasion for the  governors of the several states to speak out in reference to these crimes  against law and order.    No matter how heinous the act of the lynchers may have been, it was  discussed only for a day or so and then dismissed from the attention of  the public. In one or two instances the governor has called attention to  the crime, but the civil processes entirely failed to bring the murderers  to justice. Since the crusade against lynching was started, however,  governors of states, newspapers, senators and representatives and bishops  of churches have all been compelled to take cognizance of the prevalence  of this crime and to speak in one way or another in the defense of the  charge against this barbarism in the United States. This has not been  because there was any latent spirit of justice voluntarily asserting  itself, especially in those who do the lynching, but because the entire  American people now feel, both North and South, that they are objects in  the gaze of the civilized world and that for every lynching humanity asks  that America render its account to civilization and itself.      AWFUL BARBARISM IGNORED    Much has been said during the months of September and October of 1894  about the lynching of six colered men who on suspicion of incendiarism  were made the victims of a most barbarous massacre.    They were arrested, one by one, by officers of the law; they were  handcuffed and chained together and by the officers of the law loaded in a  wagon and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14980"],[0,"Outwitting Our Nerves: A Primer of Psychotherapy (#14)"],[1,"it  when we are at the telephone, busily writing or drawing remarkable  pictures while the rest of us is engaged in conversation.    The present epidemic of the Ouija board shows how many persons there  are who are able to switch off the conscious mind and let the  subconscious control the muscles that are used in writing. The fact  that the writer has no understanding of what he is doing and believes  himself directed by some outside power, in no way interferes with the  subconscious phenomenon.    =Everyday Doings.= Besides perceptions which were originally so far  from the focus of attention that the conscious mind never caught them  at all, there are the little experiences of everyday life, fleeting  thoughts and impressions which occupy us for a minute and then  disappear. Every experience is a dynamic fact and no matter how  trivial the experience may be or how completely forgotten, it still  exists as a part of the personality.    An amusing example of the everyday kind of forgotten experience  occurred during the writing of this chapter. I wrote a sentence which  pleased me very well. This is the sentence: \"In the esthetic processes  of evolution they [man's desires] have sunk below the surface as soon  as formed, and have been covered over by an elastic and snug-fitting  consciousness as the skin covers in the tissues and organs of the  body.\" After showing this passage to my collaborator and remarking  that this figure had never been used before, I was partly chagrined  and partly amused to have her bring me the following sentence from  White and Jelliffe: \"Consciousness covered over and obscured the inner  organs of the psyche just as the skin hides the inner organs of the  body from vision.\" My originality had vanished and I was close to  plagiarism. Indeed, if a history of plagiarism could be written, it  would probably abound in just such stories. I had read the article  containing this sentence only once, about three years before, and had  never quoted it or consciously thought of it. It had lain buried for  three years, only to come forth as an original idea of my own. Who  knows how many times we all do just this thing without catching  ourselves in the trick?    =Back-Door Memories.= There are other kinds of memories which hide in  the subconscious, memories of experiences which have not come in by  the front door, but have entered the mind during special states, such  as sleep, delirium, intoxication, or hypnosis. What is known as  post-hypnotic suggestion is the functioning of a suggestion received  during hypnosis and emerging later as an impulse without being  recognized as a memory. A man in a hypnotic state is told that at five  o'clock he will take off his clothes and go to bed, without  remembering that such a suggestion has been given him. He awakens with  no recollection of the suggestion, but at five o'clock he suddenly  feels impelled to go to bed, even though his unreasonable desire puts  him into a highly embarrassing position. The suggestion, to be thus  effective, must have been conserved somewhere in his mind outside of  consciousness.    Suggestions that enter the mind during the normal sleep are also  recorded,--a fact that carries a warning to people who are in the  habit of talking of all sorts of matters while in the room with  sleeping children. I have sometimes suggested to sleeping patients  that on waking they will remember and tell me the cause of their  symptoms. The following example shows not only the conservation of  impressions gained in sleep, but also the sway of forgotten ideas of  childhood, still strong in mature years. This young woman, a trained  nurse, with many marked symptoms of hysteria, had been asked casually  to bring a book from the Public Library. She cried out in  consternation, \"Oh, no, I am afraid!\" After a good deal of urging she  finally brought the book, although at the cost of considerable effort.  Later, while she was taking a nap, I said to her, \"You will not  remember that I have talked to you. You will stay asleep while I am  talking and while you are asleep there will come to your mind the  reasons why you are afraid to go to the Public Library. When you  waken, you will tell me all about it.\" Upon awakening, she said: \"Oh,  do you know, I can tell you why I have always been afraid to go to the  Public Library. While I was in Parochial School, Father ---- used to  come in and tell us children to use the books out of the school  library and never to go to the Public Library.\" I questioned her  concerning her idea of the reason for such an injunction and what she  thought was in the books which she was told not to read. She  hesitatingly stated that it was her idea, even in childhood, that the  books dealt with topics concerning the tabooed subject of the birth of  children and kindred matters.    =Smoldering Volcanoes.= Let us now consider those emotional  experiences which seem far too compelling to be forgotten, but which  may live within us for years without giving any evidence of their  existence. Memories like these are apt to be anything but a dead past.    Many of my own patients have uncovered emotional memories through  simply talking out to me whatever came into their minds, laying aside  their critical faculty and letting their minds wander on into whatever  paths association led them. This is known as the free-association  method, and simple as it seems, is one of the most effective in  uncovering memories which have been forgotten for years. One of my  patients, a refined, highly educated woman of middle age, had suffered  for two years with almost constant nausea. One day, after a long talk,  with no suggestion on my part, only an occasional, \"What does that  remind you of?\" she told with great emotion an experience which she  had had at eighteen years of age, in which she had for a moment been  sexually attracted to a boy friend, but had recoiled as soon as she  realized where her impulse was leading her. She had been so horrified  at the idea of her degradation, so nauseated at what she considered  her sin, that she had put it out of her mind, denied that such a  thought had ever been hers, repressed the desire into the  subconscious, where it had continued to function unsatisfied,  unassimilated with her mature judgments. Her nausea was the symbol of  a moral disgust. Physical nausea she was willing to acknowledge, but  not this other thing. Upon reciting this old experience, with every  sign of the original shame, she cried: \"Oh, Doctor! why did you bring  this up? I had forgotten it. I haven't thought of it in thirty years.\"  I reminded her that I couldn't bring it up,--I had never known  anything about it. With the emotional incoming of this memory and the  saner attitude toward it which the mature woman's mind was able to  take, the nausea disappeared for good. This case is typical of the  psycho-neuroses and we shall have occasion to refer to it again. The  present emphasis is on the fact that an emotional memory may be buried  for many years while it still retains the power of reappearing in more  or less disguised manifestation.    =Repressed Memories.= If we ask how so burning a memory could escape  from the consciousness of a grown woman, we are driven to the  conclusion that this forgetting can be the result of no mere quiet  fading away, but that there must have been some active force at work  which kept the memory from coming into awareness. It was not lost. It  was not passive. Out of sight was not out of mind. There must have  been a reason for its expulsion from the personal consciousness. In  fact, we find that there is a reason. We find that whenever a vital  emotional experience disappears from view, it is because it is too  painful to be endured in consciousness. Nor is it ever the pain of an  impersonal experience or even the thought of what some one else has  done to us that drives a memory out of mind. As a matter of fact, we  never expel a memory except when it bears directly on ourselves and on  our own opinion of ourselves. We can stand almost anything else, but  we cannot stand an idea that does not fit in with our ideal for  ourselves. This is not the pious ideal that we should like to live up  to and that we hope to attain some day, not the ideal that we think we  ought to have--like never speaking ill of others or never being  selfish--but the secret picture that each of us has, locked away  within him, the specifications of ourselves reduced to their lowest  terms, below which we cannot go. Energized by the instinct of positive  self-feeling, and organized with the moral sentiments which we have  acquired from education and the ideals of society, especially those  acquired in early childhood, this ideal of ourselves becomes  incorporated into our conscience and is an absolute necessity for our  happiness.    We have found that when two emotions clash, one drives out the other.  So in this case, the woman's positive self-feeling of self-respect,  combined with disgust, drove from the field that other emotion of the  reproductive instinct which was trying to get expression. Speaking  technically, one repressed the other. The woman said to herself, \"No,  I never could have had such a thought,\" and promptly forgot it.  Needless to say, this kind of handling did not kill the impulse.  Buried in the depths of her soul, it continued to live like a live  coal, until in later years, fanned by the wind of some new experience,  it burst into flame.    In this case the wish had originally flashed into awareness for an  instant, but very often the impulse never gets into consciousness at  all. The upper layers of the subconscious, where the acquired ideals  live, automatically work to keep down any desires which are thought to  be out of keeping with the person as he knows himself. He then would  emphatically deny that such desires had ever had any place in his  life.    Freud has called"]]]
