This time I want to tell you about a \"stocking-leg\" dinner which I  attended not long ago. It doesn't sound very respectable, but it was  one of the happiest events I ever remember.    Mrs. Louderer was here visiting us, and one afternoon we were all in  the kitchen when Gavotte came skimming along on the first pair of  snowshoes I ever saw. We have had lots of snow this winter, and many of  the hollows and gullies are packed full. Gavotte had no difficulty in  coming, and he had come for the mail and to invite us to a feast of \"ze  hose.\" I could not think what kind of a dinner it could be, and I did  not believe that Mr. Stewart would go, but after Gavotte had explained  how much easier it was now than at any other time because the  hard-packed snow made it possible to go with bobsleds, I knew he would  go. I can't say I really wanted to go, but Mrs. Louderer took it for  granted that it would be delightful, so she and Mr. Stewart did the  planning. Next morning Gavotte met Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and invited her.  Then, taking the mail, he went on ahead to blaze a trail we should  follow with the sleds. We were to start two days later. They planned we  could easily make the trip in a day, as, with the gulches filled with  snow, short cuts were possible, and we could travel at a good pace, as  we would have a strong team. To me it seemed dangerous, but  dinner-parties have not been so plenty that I could miss one. So, when  the day came on which we were to start, we were up betimes and had a  mess-box packed and Mr. Stewart had a big pile of rocks hot. We all  wore our warmest clothes, and the rest carried out hot rocks and  blankets while I put the kitchen in such order that the men left to  feed the stock would have no trouble in getting their meals. Mr.  Stewart carried out the mess-box, and presently we were off. We had a  wagon-box on bobsleds, and the box was filled with hay and hot rocks  with blankets on top and more to cover us. Mr. Stewart had two big bags  of grain in front, feed for the horses, and he sat on them.    It was a beautiful day and we jogged along merrily. We had lots of fun,  and as we went a new way, there was much that was new to Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy and myself, and it was all new to the rest. Gavotte had  told us where we should noon, and we reached the place shortly after  twelve. Mr. Stewart went to lift out the mess-box,--but he had  forgotten to put it in! Oh, dear! We were a disappointed lot. I don't  think I was ever so hungry, but there was nothing for it but to grin  and bear it. It did me some good, though, to remember how a man misses  his dinner. The horses had to be fed, so we walked about while they  were eating. We went up a canon that had high cliffs on one side, and  came to a place where, high up on the rock wall, in great black  letters, was this legend: \"Dick fell off of this here clift and died.\"  I should think there would be no question that any one who fell from  that place on to the boulders below _would_ die.    Soon we started again, and if not quite so jolly as we were before, at  least we looked forward to our supper with a keen relish and the horses  were urged faster than they otherwise would have been. The beautiful  snow is rather depressing, however, when there is snow everywhere. The  afternoon passed swiftly and the horses were becoming jaded. At four  o'clock it was almost dark. We had been going up a deep canon and came  upon an appalling sight. There had been a snow-slide and the canon was  half-filled with snow, rock, and broken trees. The whole way was  blocked, and what to do we didn't know, for the horses could hardly be  gotten along and we could not pass the snow-slide. We were twenty-five  miles from home, night was almost upon us, and we were almost starved.  But we were afraid to stay in that canon lest more snow should slide  and bury us, so sadly we turned back to find as comfortable a place as  we could to spend the night. The prospects were very discouraging, and  I am afraid we were all near tears, when suddenly there came upon the  cold air a clear blast from a horn. Mrs. Louderer cried, \"Ach, der  reveille!\" Once I heard a lecturer tell of climbing the Matterhorn and  the calls we heard brought his story to mind. No music could have been  so beautiful. It soon became apparent that we were being signaled; so  we drove in the direction of the sound and found ourselves going up a  wide canon. We had passed the mouth of it shortly before we had come to  the slide. Even the tired horses took new courage, and every few  moments a sweet, clear call put new heart into us. Soon we saw a light.  We had to drive very slowly and in places barely crept. The bugler  changed his notes and we knew he was wondering if we were coming, so  Mr. Stewart helloed. At once we had an answer, and after that we were  steadily guided by the horn. Many times we could not see the light, but  we drove in the right direction because we could hear the horn.    At last, when it was quite dark and the horses could go no farther, we  drew up before the fire that had been our beacon light. It was a  bonfire built out upon a point of rock at the end of the canon. Back  from it among the pines was a 'dobe house. A dried-up mummy of a man  advanced from the fire to meet us, explaining that he had seen us  through his field-glasses and, knowing about the snow-slide, had  ventured to attract us to his poor place. Carlota Juanita was within,  prepared for the _senoras_, if they would but walk in. If they would!  More dead than alive, we scrambled out, cold-stiffened and hungry.  Carlota Juanita threw open the low, wide door and we stumbled into  comfort. She hastened to help us off with our wraps, piled more wood on  the open fire, and busied herself to make us welcome and comfortable.  Poor Carlota Juanita! Perhaps you think she was some slender,  limpid-eyed, olive-cheeked beauty. She was fat and forty, but not fair.  She had the biggest wad of hair that I ever saw, and her face was so  fat that her eyes looked beady. She wore an old heelless pair of  slippers or sandals that would hardly stay on, and at every step they  made the most exasperating sliding noise, but she was all kindness and  made us feel very welcome. The floor was of dirt, and they had the  largest fireplace I have ever seen, with the widest, cleanest hearth,  which was where they did their cooking. All their furniture was  home-made, and on a low bench near the door were three water-jars  which, I am sure, were handmade. Away back in a corner they had a small  altar, on which was a little statue of Mary and the Child. Before it,  suspended by a wire from the rafters, was a cow's horn in which a piece  of punk was burning, just as the incense is kept burning in churches.  Supper was already prepared and was simmering and smoking on the  hearth. As soon as the men came in, Carlota Juanita put it on the  table, which was bare of cloth. I can't say that I really like Mexican  bread, but they certainly know how to cook meat. They had a most  wonderful pot-roast with potatoes and corn dumplings that were  delicious. The roast had been slashed in places and small bits of  garlic, pepper, bacon, and, I think, parsley, inserted. After it and  the potatoes and the dumplings were done, Carlota had poured in a can  of tomatoes. You may not think that was good, but I can assure you it  was and that we did ample justice to it. After we had eaten until we  were hardly able to swallow, Carlota Juanita served a queer Mexican  pie. It was made of dried buffalo-berries, stewed and made very sweet.  A layer of batter had been poured into a deep baking-dish, then the  berries, and then more batter. Then it was baked and served hot with  plenty of hard sauce; and it was powerful good, too. She had very  peculiar coffee with goat's milk in it. I took mine without the milk,  but I couldn't make up my mind that I liked the coffee. We sat around  the fire drinking it, when Manuel Pedro Felipe told us it was some he  had brought from Mexico. I didn't know they raised it there, but he  told us many interesting things about it. He and Carlota Juanita both  spoke fairly good English. They had lived for many years in their  present home and had some sheep, a few goats, a cow or two, a few pigs,  and chickens and turkeys. They had a small patch of land that Carlota  Juanita tilled and on which was raised the squaw corn that hung in  bunches from the rafters. Down where we live we can't get sweet corn to  mature, but here, so much higher up, they have a sheltered little nook  where they are able to raise many things. Upon a long shelf above the  fire was an ugly old stone image, the bottom broken off and some  plaster applied to make it set level. The ugly thing they had brought  with them from some old ruined temple in Mexico. We were all so very  tired that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#14)"],[1,"is made  to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to  treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.    The other terror[181] that scares us from self-trust is our  consistency;[182] a reverence for our past act or word, because the  eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit[183] than  our past acts, and we are loth to disappoint them.    But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about  this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat[184] you have  stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict  yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on  your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring  the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in  a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the  Deity; yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them  heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color.  Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and  flee.[185]    A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by  little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a  great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself  with the shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words,  and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though  it contradict everything you said to-day.--\"Ah, so you shall be sure  to be misunderstood.\"--Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood?  Pythagoras[186] was misunderstood, and Socrates,[187] and Jesus, and  Luther,[188] and Copernicus,[189] and Galileo,[190] and Newton,[191]  and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to  be misunderstood.    I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will  are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of  Andes[192] and Himmaleh[193] are insignificant in the curve of the  sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character is  like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza;[194]--read it forward,  backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing,  contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my  honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it  will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not, and see it not. My  book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects. The  swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he  carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are.  Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate  their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue  or vice emit a breath every moment.    There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be  each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions  will be harmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost  sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought. One  tendency unites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line  of a hundred tacks.[195] See the line from a sufficient distance, and  it straightens itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action  will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your  conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already  done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If  I can be firm enough to-day to do right, and scorn eyes,[196] I must  have done so much right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will,  do right now. Always scorn appearances, and you always may. The force  of character is cumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their  health into this. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate  and the field, which so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a  train of great days and victories behind. They shed an united light on  the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels.  That is it which throws thunder into Chatham's[197] voice, and dignity  into Washington's port, and America into Adams's[198] eye. Honor is  venerable to us because it is no ephemeris. It is always ancient  virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it  and pay it homage, because it is not a trap for our love and homage,  but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old  immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person.    I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and  consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward.  Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the  Spartan[199] fife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is  coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he  should wish to please me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I  would make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand  the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl  in the face of custom, and trade, and office, the fact which is the  upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and  Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no  other time or place, but is the center of things. Where he is, there  is nature. He measures you, and all men, and all events. Ordinarily,  everybody in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other  person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes  place of the whole creation. The man must be so much, that he must  make all circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a  country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time  fully to accomplish his design;--and posterity seem to follow his  steps as a train of clients. A man Caesar[200] is born, and for ages  after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds  so grow and cleave to his genius, that he is confounded with virtue  and the possible of man. An institution is the lengthened shadow of  one man; as Monachism, of the hermit Antony;[201] the Reformation, of  Luther; Quakerism, of Fox;[202] Methodism, of Wesley;[203] Abolition,  of Clarkson.[204] Scipio,[205] Milton called \"the height of Rome\"; and  all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few  stout and earnest persons.    Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him  not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy,  a bastard, or an interloper, in the world which exists for him. But  the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds  to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels  poor when he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, a costly book,  have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem  to say like that, \"Who are you, Sir?\" Yet they all are his, suitors  for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out  and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict: it is not to  command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular  fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried  to the duke's house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke's bed,  and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the  duke, and assured that he had been insane,[206] owes its popularity to  the fact that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the  world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason,  and finds himself a true prince.    Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history, our imagination  plays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier  vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common  day's work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total  of both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred,[207] and  Scanderbeg,[208] and Gustavus?[209] Suppose they were virtuous; did  they wear out virtue? As great a stake depends on your private act  to-day, as followed their public and renowned steps. When private men  shall act with original views, the luster will be transferred from the  actions of kings to those of gentlemen.    The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the  eyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual  reverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which  men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great  proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale  of men and things, and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money  but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the  hieroglyphic[210] by which they obscurely signified their  consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every  man.    The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we  inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the  aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What  is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without  parallax,[211] without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of  beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of  independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the  essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity  or Instinct. We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all  later teachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind  which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For the  sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the  soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time,  from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same  source whence their life and being also proceed. We first share the  life by which"]]]
