The German officers are skilled in       leading troops forward under cover, in closed bodies, but once the       latter are deployed and there is no longer direct personal       leadership the men will not face heavy fire. Sometimes the advance       is made in a series of lines, with the men well opened out at five       or six paces interval; at other times it is made in a line, with       the men almost shoulder to shoulder, followed in all cases by       supports in close formation. The latter either waver when the front       line is checked, or crowd on to it, moving forward under the orders       of their officers, and the mass forms a magnificent target.       Prisoners have described the fire of our troops as pinning them to       the ground, and this is certainly borne out by their action.         When the Germans are not heavily intrenched no great losses are       incurred in advancing against them by the methods in which the       British Army has been instructed. For instance, in one attack over       fairly open ground against about an equal force of infantry       sheltered in a sunken road and in ditches we lost only 10 killed       and 60 wounded, while over 400 of the enemy surrendered after about       50 had been killed. Each side had the support of a battery, but the       fight for superiority from infantry fire took place at about 700       yards and lasted only half an hour. When the Germans were wavering       some of them put up the white flag, but others went on firing, and       our men continued to do the same. Eventually a large number of       white flags, improvised from handkerchiefs, pieces of shirt, white       biscuit bags, &c., were exhibited all along the line, and many men       hoisted their helmets on their rifles.         In the fighting behind intrenchments the Germans endeavor to gain       ground by making advances in line at dusk or just before dawn, and       then digging themselves in, in the hope, no doubt, that they may       eventually get so near as to be able, as at manoeuvres, to reach       the hostile trenches in a single rush. They have never succeeded in       doing this against us. If by creeping up in dead ground they do       succeed in gaining ground by night, they are easily driven back by       fire in the morning. A few of the braver men sometimes remain       behind, at ranges of even 300 or 400 yards, and endeavor to inflict       losses by sniping. Sharpshooters, also, are often noticed in trees       or wriggling about until they get good cover. The remedy is to take       the initiative and detail men to deal with the enemy's       sharpshooters.         A few night attacks have been made against us. Before one of them a       party crept up close to the British line and set alight a hayrick,       so that it should form a beacon on which the centre of the       attacking line marched. Generally, however, in the night and early       morning attacks, groups of forty or fifty men have come on, the       groups sometimes widely separated from one another and making every       endeavor to obtain any advantage from cover. Light balls and       searchlights have on some occasions been used. Latterly the attacks       have become more and more half-hearted. Against us the enemy has       never closed with the bayonet. The German trenches I have seen were       deep enough to shelter a man when firing standing, and had a step       down in rear for the supports to sit in.         As regards our own men, there was at first considerable reluctance       to intrench, as has always been the case at the commencement of a       war. Now, however, having bought experience dearly, their defenses       are such that they can defy the German artillery fire.          VI.    *Becomes an Artillery Duel*.    [Made Public Oct. 10.]      Comparative calm on our front has continued through the fine and  considerably warmer weather. The last six days have been slightly misty  with clouds hanging low, so that conditions have not been very favorable  for aerial reconnoissance.    In regard to the latter, it is astonishing how quickly the habit is  acquired, even by those who are not aviators, of thinking of the  weather in terms of its suitability for flying. There has been a bright  moon also, which has militated against night attacks.    On Saturday, Oct. 3, practically nothing happened, except that each side  shelled the other.    Toward evening on Sunday, Oct. 4, there was a similar absence of  activity. Opposite one portion of our line the enemy's bands played  patriotic airs, and the audiences which gathered gave a chance to our  waiting howitzers.    Not only do their regimental bands perform occasionally, but with their  proverbial fondness for music the Germans have in some places  gramophones [Transcriber: original 'gramaphones'] in their trenches.    On Monday, the 5th, there were three separate duels in the air between  French and German aviators, one of which was visible from our trenches.  Two of the struggles were, so far as could be seen, indecisive, but in  the third the French airmen were victorious, and brought down their  opponents, both of whom were killed by machine gun fire. The observer  was so burned as to be unrecognizable.    During the day some men of the Landwehr were taken prisoners by us. They  were in very poor condition and wept copiously when captured. One, on  being asked what he was crying for, explained that though they had been  advised to surrender to the English, they believed that they would be  shot.    On that evening our airmen had an unusual amount of attention paid to  them, both by the German aviators and their artillery of every  description.    One of our infantry patrols discovered 150 dead Germans in a wood, one  and a half miles from our front. We sent a party out to bury them, but  it was fired upon and had to withdraw.    On Tuesday, the 6th, the enemy's guns were active in the afternoon. It  is believed that the bombardment was due to anger because two of our  howitzer shells had detonated right in one of the enemy's trenches,  which was full of men. Three horses were killed by the German fire.    Wednesday, the 7th, was uneventful.    On Thursday, the 8th, the shelling by the enemy of a locality on our  front, which has so far been the scene of their greatest efforts, was  again continuous. Opposite one or two points the Germans have attempted  to gain ground by sapping in some places with the view of secretly  pushing forward machine guns in advance of their trenches, so that they  can suddenly sweep with crossfire the space between our line and theirs,  and so take any advance of ours on the flank.    It is reported that at one point where the French were much annoyed by  the fire of a German machine gun, which was otherwise inaccessible, they  drove a mine gallery, 50 meters (about 164 feet) long, up to and under  the emplacement, and blew up the gun. The man who drove the gallery  belonged to a corps which was recruited in one of the coal-mining  districts of France.    The German machine guns are mounted on low sledges, and are  inconspicuous and evidently easily moved.    The fighting now consists mostly of shelling by the artillery of both  sides and in front a line of fire from the machine guns as an occasional  target offers. Our Maxims have been doing excellent work and have proved  most efficient weapons for the sort of fighting in which we are now  engaged.    At times there are so many outbursts of their fire in different  directions that it is possible for an expert to tell by comparison which  of the guns have their springs adjusted and are well tuned up for the  day. The amount of practice that our officers are now getting in the use  of this weapon is proving most valuable in teaching them how to maintain  it at concert pitch as an instrument and how to derive the best tactical  results from its employment.    Against us the Germans are not now expending so much gun ammunition as  they have been, but they continue to fire at insignificant targets. They  have the habit of suddenly dropping heavy shells without warning in  localities of villages far behind our front line, possibly on the chance  of catching some of our troops in bivouac or billets. They also fire a  few rounds at night.    The artillery has up to now played so great a part in the war that a few  general remarks descriptive of the methods of its employment by the  enemy are justified. Their field artillery armament consists of  15-pounder quick-fire guns for horse and field batteries of divisions  and there are, in addition, with each corps three to six batteries of  4.3-inch field howitzers and about two batteries of 5.9-inch howitzers.  With an army there are some 8.2-inch heavy howitzers.    The accuracy of their fire is apt at first to cause some alarm, more  especially as the guns are usually well concealed and the position and  the direction from which the fire is proceeding are difficult of  detection. But accurate as is their shooting, the German gunners have on  the whole had little luck, and during the past three weeks an  astonishingly small proportion of the number of shells fired by them  have been really effective.    Quite the most striking feature of their handling of the artillery is  the speed with which they concentrate the fire upon any selected point.  They dispense to a great extent with the method of ranging known by us  as bracketing, especially when acting on the defensive, and direct their  fire by means of squared maps and the telephone. Thus, when the target  is found, its position on the map is telephoned to such batteries as it  is desired to employ against that particular square.    In addition to the guns employed to fire on the targets as they are  picked up, others are told off to watch particular"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16370"],[0,"Lameness of the Horse (#14)"],[1,"in runaway accidents do serious injury to  the bursa and because of the peculiar and important part it plays during  locomotion, serious injuries are not likely to resolve, and too often  chronic lameness results. It is to be noted that the tendon of the  biceps brachii (flexor brachii) is always involved in cases of  inflammation of the bicipital bursa, and according to the late Dr.  Bell[8] strain of the biceps brachii is a frequent cause of lameness in  city horses, more frequent than is generally supposed.    Pathological Anatomy.--More or less destruction of the cartilaginous  portion of the bursa, sometimes involving the tendinous portion of the  biceps, takes place and, according to Moller, in some instances there  occurs ossification of the tendon. Autopsies in some old horses reveal  the presence of erosions of cartilage and hyperthrophy of the inflamed  parts.    Symptoms.--In acute inflammations, there is always marked lameness.  This is manifested to a greater degree when the subject advances the  affected leg. There is incomplete advancement of the member; the toe is  dragged when the horse is made to walk and the foot kept in a position  posterior to the opposite or weight bearing foot while the subject is at  rest. Lameness is disproportionate to the amount of local manifestation  in the way of heat, swelling and pain that is to be recognized on  palpation. In fact, in some cases so much pain attends the condition  that no weight is borne by the affected member, and when compelled to  walk, the subject hops on the sound leg.    Chronic inflammation of the bicipital bursa is occasionally met with  wherein both members are affected. Because of the nature of the  structures involved, when inflamed, chronic inflammation is a more  frequent termination than is complete recovery. Bilateral affections are  seen in horses that are driven for years, regularly at a fast pace on  paved streets. In such cases, the gait is stilted, that is, there is  incomplete advancement of both members and, of course, the period of  weight bearing is correspondingly shortened; hence the short strides.    In chronic cases, little if any evidence of inflammation is to be  detected by digital manipulation of the parts. If flinching occurs, one  is often unable to interpret the manifestation as to whether it is due  to inflammation or not.    There is no marked \"warming out\" in this condition, and animals are  nearly as lame after having been driven a considerable distance as when  started, although the lameness is not as a rule very great.    Treatment.--In very painful cases acute inflammation is treated by  employing cold applications during the initial stage. Cracked ice when  contained in a suitable sack may be held in contact with the affected  part and the pack is supported by means of cords or tapes as suggested  in the discussion on treatment of scapulohumeral arthritis on page 66.  Later, hot applications may be employed to good advantage.    In the course of ten days or two weeks, if the acute painful condition  has entirely subsided, vesication is indicated. The ordinary mercury and  cantharides combination does very well. Depending upon the course taken  in any given case, one is guided in the treatment employed. If prompt  resolution comes to pass, the subject may be given free run at pasture  after three or four weeks confinement in a box stall. If, however, the  case does not progress in a prompt and satisfactory manner, absolute  quiet must be enforced for six weeks or more. Repeated blistering is  beneficial, although it is doubtful if firing is of sufficient benefit  in the average chronic case of intertubercular bursitis to justify the  punishment which this form of treatment inflicts, unless infliction of  pain is the thing sought, to enforce repose in restless subjects.  Patients are best given a long rest at pasture and returned to work for  two or three months after an acute attack of inflammation of the bursa,  lest the condition become chronic. When due consideration is given the  pathology of such cases, the frequent unsatisfactory termination under  the most careful treatment, is readily understood.      Contusions of the Triceps Brachii.  (Triceps Extensor Brachii: Caput Muscles.)    Anatomy.--The triceps brachii is the principal structure which fills  the space between the posterior border of the scapula and the humerus.  The several heads originate for the most part on the border of the  scapula, the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus and the shaft of the  humerus. Insertion of this large muscular mass is effected by means of  several tendons to the olecranon. A synovial bursa is situated  underneath the tendinous attachment of the posterior portion of the  triceps brachii--the long head or caput magnum.    The function of the triceps as a whole is to flex the shoulder joint and  extend the forearm. The triceps brachii is the chief antagonist of the  biceps brachii.    Etiology and Occurrence.--Owing to the exposed position of this  structure, it is not infrequently contused, the result of falls, kicks  and other injuries. The function of the triceps is such that it becomes  strained upon rare occasions when a horse resists confinement of  restraint in such manner that the parts are unduly tensed in  contraction. This sort of resistance may stretch the radial nerve or its  branches in a way that paralysis results. A condition known as \"dropped  elbow\" is described by Henry Taylor, F.R.C.V.S., in the Veterinary  Record[9], wherein a two-year-old colt while resisting confinement was  so injured.    The triceps group because of its convenient location, constitutes the  site for hypodermic injection of drugs and biologic agents, with some  practitioners; and as a result, more or less inflammation may occur. The  author has observed and treated some twenty cases where an intensely  painful infectious inflammation of the triceps brachii was caused by  the intramuscular injection of a caustic solution by a cruel and  unscrupulous empiric, whose object was to increase his practice.    Symptomatology.--As the triceps brachii is not particularly taxed  during weight bearing in the subject at rest, there may be no unnatural  position assumed during inflammation of the triceps. More or less  swelling and supersensitiveness is always present, however, and great  care and discrimination must be exercised in digital manipulation of the  triceps region because many animals are normally sensitive to palpation  of these parts. It is sometimes difficult to correctly interpret the  true state of conditions because of this peculiarity.    There is always swinging-leg-lameness, which is accentuated when the  subject is urged to trot. Where symptoms are pronounced, it is  unnecessary to cause the subject to move at a faster pace than at a walk  to recognize the condition. The forward stride is shortened and in  extremley painful conditions, no attempt is made to extend the leg. It  is simply carried _en une piece_--flexion of the shoulder and elbow  joints is carefully avoided.    Treatment.--During the early stage of inflammation, hot or cold  applications are beneficial. Long continued use of moist  heat--fomentations--allays pain and stimulates resolution. Keeping in  contact with the painfully swollen parts a suitable bag filled with  bran, which can be moistened at intervals with warm water, constitutes a  practical and easy means of treatment. By employing this method, one is  more likely to succeed in having his patient properly cared for, in that  less work is entailed than if hot fomentations are prescribed.    After the acute and painful stage has subsided, a stimulating liniment  is of benefit. The subject should be kept within a comfortable and roomy  box stall for a sufficient length of time to favor prompt resolution.  Wild and nervous subjects, if not so confined, will probably overexert  the affected parts if allowed the freedom of a paddock or pasture.    Where the inflammation becomes infective, surgical interference is  necessary. The prompt evacuation of pus, with adequate provision for  wound discharge, should be attended to before extensive destruction of  tissue takes place. Resolution is prompt as a rule in such cases because  of the vascularity of the structures and the ease with which proper  drainage may be effected. No special after-care is necessary if drainage  is perfect, except that one should avoid injecting the wound cavity with  aqueous solutions unless it be absolutely necessary to cleanse such  cavity, and then it is best to swab the wound rather than to irrigate it  freely.      Shoulder Atrophy.  (Sweeny or Swinney)    No satisfactory consideration of the pathogeny of this condition is  recorded, but practitioners have long distinguished between muscular  atrophies which are apparently caused without doing serious injury to  nerves and muscular atrophy which seems to be due to nerve affection. In  the first instance, recovery when proper attention is given, is prompt;  whereas, in the latter, regeneration of the wasted tissues requires  months in spite of the best sort of treatment.    The parts more frequently affected are the supra- and infrascapularis  (antea- and posteaspinatus) muscles. But in some cases the triceps group  is involved; however, this occurs in unusual and chronic affections. No  doubt, these chronic cases are due to suspended innervation and are not  to be classed with the ordinary case of atrophy of the abductor muscles  of the humerus (supra- and infraspinatus) as in the usual case of  \"sweeny.\"    Occurrence.--Shoulder atrophy such as the general practitioner  commonly meets with, is an affection, more often seen in young animals  and it seems to be due to injuries of various kinds which contuse the  muscles of the shoulder. Ill-fitting collars and pulling in a manner  that there occurs side draft with unusual strain on the muscles of one  side of "]]]
