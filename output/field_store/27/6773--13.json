While we were in this  situation, one day the admiral, with most of the principal officers,  and many people of all stations, being on shore, about seven o'clock  in the evening we were alarmed by signals from the frigates stationed  for that purpose; and in an instant there was a general cry that the  French fleet was out, and just passing through the streights. The  admiral immediately came on board with some other officers; and it is  impossible to describe the noise, hurry and confusion throughout the  whole fleet, in bending their sails and slipping their cables; many  people and ships' boats were left on shore in the bustle. We had two  captains on board of our ship who came away in the hurry and left  their ships to follow. We shewed lights from the gun-whale to the main  topmast-head; and all our lieutenants were employed amongst the fleet  to tell the ships not to wait for their captains, but to put the sails  to the yards, slip their cables and follow us; and in this confusion  of making ready for fighting we set out for sea in the dark after the  French fleet. Here I could have exclaimed with Ajax,        \"Oh Jove! O father! if it be thy will      That we must perish, we thy will obey,      But let us perish by the light of day.\"    They had got the start of us so far that we were not able to come up  with them during the night; but at daylight we saw seven sail of the  line of battle some miles ahead. We immediately chased them till about  four o'clock in the evening, when our ships came up with them; and,  though we were about fifteen large ships, our gallant admiral only  fought them with his own division, which consisted of seven; so that  we were just ship for ship. We passed by the whole of the enemy's  fleet in order to come at their commander, Mons. La Clue, who was in  the Ocean, an eighty-four gun ship: as we passed they all fired on us;  and at one time three of them fired together, continuing to do so for  some time. Notwithstanding which our admiral would not suffer a gun to  be fired at any of them, to my astonishment; but made us lie on our  bellies on the deck till we came quite close to the Ocean, who was  ahead of them all; when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers  into her at once.    The engagement now commenced with great fury on both sides: the Ocean  immediately returned our fire, and we continued engaged with each  other for some time; during which I was frequently stunned with the  thundering of the great guns, whose dreadful contents hurried many of  my companions into awful eternity. At last the French line was  entirely broken, and we obtained the victory, which was immediately  proclaimed with loud huzzas and acclamations. We took three prizes, La  Modeste, of sixty-four guns, and Le Temeraire and Centaur, of  seventy-four guns each. The rest of the French ships took to flight  with all the sail they could crowd. Our ship being very much damaged,  and quite disabled from pursuing the enemy, the admiral immediately  quitted her, and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board  the Newark, with which, and some other ships, he went after the  French. The Ocean, and another large French ship, called the  Redoubtable, endeavouring to escape, ran ashore at Cape Logas, on the  coast of Portugal; and the French admiral and some of the crew got  ashore; but we, finding it impossible to get the ships off, set fire  to them both. About midnight I saw the Ocean blow up, with a most  dreadful explosion. I never beheld a more awful scene. In less than a  minute the midnight for a certain space seemed turned into day by the  blaze, which was attended with a noise louder and more terrible than  thunder, that seemed to rend every element around us.    My station during the engagement was on the middle-deck, where I was  quartered with another boy, to bring powder to the aftermost gun; and  here I was a witness of the dreadful fate of many of my companions,  who, in the twinkling of an eye, were dashed in pieces, and launched  into eternity. Happily I escaped unhurt, though the shot and splinters  flew thick about me during the whole fight. Towards the latter part of  it my master was wounded, and I saw him carried down to the surgeon;  but though I was much alarmed for him and wished to assist him I dared  not leave my post. At this station my gun-mate (a partner in bringing  powder for the same gun) and I ran a very great risk for more than  half an hour of blowing up the ship. For, when we had taken the  cartridges out of the boxes, the bottoms of many of them proving  rotten, the powder ran all about the deck, near the match tub: we  scarcely had water enough at the last to throw on it. We were also,  from our employment, very much exposed to the enemy's shots; for we  had to go through nearly the whole length of the ship to bring the  powder. I expected therefore every minute to be my last; especially  when I saw our men fall so thick about me; but, wishing to guard as  much against the dangers as possible, at first I thought it would be  safest not to go for the powder till the Frenchmen had fired their  broadside; and then, while they were charging, I could go and come  with my powder: but immediately afterwards I thought this caution was  fruitless; and, cheering myself with the reflection that there was a  time allotted for me to die as well as to be born, I instantly cast  off all fear or thought whatever of death, and went through the whole  of my duty with alacrity; pleasing myself with the hope, if I survived  the battle, of relating it and the dangers I had escaped to the dear  Miss Guerin, and others, when I should return to London.    Our ship suffered very much in this engagement; for, besides the  number of our killed and wounded, she was almost torn to pieces, and  our rigging so much shattered, that our mizen-mast and main-yard, &c.  hung over the side of the ship; so that we were obliged to get many  carpenters, and others from some of the ships of the fleet, to assist  in setting us in some tolerable order; and, notwithstanding, it took  us some time before we were completely refitted; after which we left  Admiral Broderick to command, and we, with the prizes, steered for  England. On the passage, and as soon as my master was something  recovered of his wounds, the admiral appointed him captain of the AEtna  fire-ship, on which he and I left the Namur, and went on board of her  at sea. I liked this little ship very much. I now became the captain's  steward, in which situation I was very happy: for I was extremely well  treated by all on board; and I had leisure to improve myself in  reading and writing. The latter I had learned a little of before I  left the Namur, as there was a school on board. When we arrived at  Spithead the AEtna went into Portsmouth harbour to refit, which being  done, we returned to Spithead and joined a large fleet that was  thought to be intended against the Havannah; but about that time the  king died: whether that prevented the expedition I know not; but it  caused our ship to be stationed at Cowes, in the isle of Wight, till  the beginning of the year sixty-one. Here I spent my time very  pleasantly; I was much on shore all about this delightful island, and  found the inhabitants very civil.    While I was here, I met with a trifling incident, which surprised me  agreeably. I was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had  a black boy about my own size; this boy having observed me from his  master's house, was transported at the sight of one of his own  countrymen, and ran to meet me with the utmost haste. I not knowing  what he was about turned a little out of his way at first, but to no  purpose: he soon came close to me and caught hold of me in his arms as  if I had been his brother, though we had never seen each other before.  After we had talked together for some time he took me to his master's  house, where I was treated very kindly. This benevolent boy and I were  very happy in frequently seeing each other till about the month of  March 1761, when our ship had orders to fit out again for another  expedition. When we got ready, we joined a very large fleet at  Spithead, commanded by Commodore Keppel, which was destined against  Belle-Isle, and with a number of transport ships with troops on board  to make a descent on the place. We sailed once more in quest of fame.  I longed to engage in new adventures and see fresh wonders.    I had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impression,  and every event which I considered as marvellous. Every extraordinary  escape, or signal deliverance, either of myself or others, I looked  upon to be effected by the interposition of Providence. We had not  been above ten days at sea before an incident of this kind happened;  which, whatever credit it may obtain from the reader, made no small  impression on my mind.    We had on board a gunner, whose name was John Mondle; a man of very  indifferent morals. This man's cabin was between the decks, exactly  over where I lay, abreast of the quarter-deck ladder. One night, the  20th of April, being terrified with a dream, he awoke in so great a  fright that he could not rest in his bed any longer, nor even remain  in his cabin; and he went upon deck about four o'clock in the morning  extremely agitated. He immediately told those on the deck of the  agonies of his mind, and the dream which occasioned it; in which he  said he had seen many things very awful, and had been warned by St.  Peter to repent, who told him time was short. This he said had greatly  alarmed him, and he was determined to alter his life. People generally  mock the fears of others when they are themselves in safety; and some  of his shipmates who heard him only laughed at him. However, he made  a vow that he never would drink strong liquors again; and he  immediately got a light, and gave away his sea-stores of liquor.

The minister, seeing the  animal wiser than himself, was ashamed, and gave up drinking, and became a  worthy minister.    HOW THE MONKEY WAS CURED.--A monkey named Kees had been taught to drink  brandy. At dinner every day he had his share like his more manly (?)  neighbors, only that his was given to him in a plate. One day, as he was  about to drink it, his master set it on fire, and he ran off frightened and  chattering. No inducement could afterward make him drink brandy. We have  many stories of animals who would never drink again after they had once  experienced its effects.    THE KEEN MARKSMAN does not poison his nerves and brain with alcohol. Angus  Cameron, a Highlander, at the age of twenty, took the Queen's prize for the  best marksmanship, and when he was twenty-two (in 1869), he won in the same  way a cup worth $1000. He made the best shot each time that ever had been  made in the contest, and neither of them has been beaten by anyone else.  Angus is a slight, modest, unassuming young man, who had been a Band of  Hope boy. When he was announced as the winner, and all the friends made an  ado over him, and offered him a generous glass of champagne, he quietly  refused their mistaken kindness, and kept his pledge.    BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, when a printer boy in London, would drink no beer, and  his companions called him the water American, and wondered that he was  stronger than they who drank beer. His companion at the press drank six  pints of beer every day, and had it to pay for. He was not only saved the  expense, but he was stronger than they, and better off in every way. If he  had gone to drinking beer at that time, like the other printer boys, it is  likely we should never have heard of him.    OATMEAL DRINK.--\"In Boulton and Watts' factory we saw an immense workman at  the hottest and heaviest work, wielding a ponderous hammer, and asked him  what liquor he drank. He replied by pointing to an immense vessel filled  with water and oatmeal, to which the men went and drank as much as they  liked.\" This is made by adding one pound fine oatmeal to each gallon of  water, and is much used in factories and at heavy work of all kinds in  Government works, instead of the old rations of alcoholic liquors. Iron  puddlers, glass blowers, and athletic trainers, all do their work now  better without alcoholic liquors.    A CHANGE IN AFFAIRS.--A poor boy was once put as an apprentice to a  mechanic; and, as he was the youngest, he was obliged to go for beer for  the older apprentices, though he never drank it. In vain they teased and  taunted him to induce him to drink; he never touched it. Now there is a  great change. Every one of those older apprentices became a drunkard, while  this temperance boy has become a master, and has more than a hundred men in  his employ. So much for total abstinence.    BOOKS BETTER THAN BEER.--An intelligent young mechanic stood up in a  temperance meeting and said: \"I have a rich treat every night among my  books. I saved my beer money and spent it in books. They cost me, with my  book-case, nearly $100. They furnish enjoyment for my winter evenings, and  have enabled me, by God's blessing, to gain much useful knowledge, such as  pots and pipes could never have given me.\"    A LITTLE DRUMMER-BOY was a favorite among the officers, who one day offered  him a glass of strong drink. He refused it, saying that he was a Cadet of  Temperance. They accused him of being afraid; but that did not move him.  Then the major commanded him to drink, saying: \"You know it is death to  disobey orders.\" The little fellow stood up at his full height, and fixing  his clear blue eyes on the face of the officer, he said: \"When I entered  the army I promised my mother on bended knees that, by the help of God, I  would not taste a drop of rum, and I mean to keep my promise. I am sorry to  disobey orders, sir, but I would rather suffer than disgrace my mother, and  break my temperance pledge.\" He was excused from drinking.           *       *       *       *       *    TOBACCO.    INTRODUCTORY LESSON.    You have been learning about the poison alcohol, and what mischief is done  by it; we will now study about another poison which thousands of persons  are using every day. It is rolled in cigars and cigarettes, and hidden in  snuff and pieces of tobacco, and does more harm to children and young  people who use these things than to grown persons.    Perhaps you know how a person feels who takes tobacco or smokes a cigar for  the first time; if not, we will tell you. He begins to be dizzy, to  tremble, to become faint, and to vomit; his head aches, and he is so sick  for hours, often for several days, that he scarcely knows what to do. Why  is he so sick? Because tobacco poison has been taken into his lungs; also,  some has mixed with the saliva and gone down into his stomach; and each  part it has reached is striving to drive it out, and is saying, by the pain  it causes, \"You have given me poison; do not give me any more.\" If he had  taken enough it would have killed him.    He recovers from this sickness and tries chewing or smoking again and  again, until he becomes accustomed to the poison and can chew or smoke and  it does not hurt him; so he thinks, but he is very much mistaken.    Tobacco is a poison, and hurts everybody who uses it every time they do so,  although it does its evil work very slowly, unless taken in large  quantities. To understand more about this we will try to learn how tobacco  is obtained, what poison is in it, and in what way it harms people.           *       *       *       *       *    THE STORY ABOUT TOBACCO.    _HOW IT CAME TO BE USED._--Tobacco is the leaves of the tobacco plant, a  native of America. It was used by the Indians of this country before  Columbus came here in 1492. Some of the Spaniards who were with him on his  second visit took some of it back with them to Portugal, and told the  people they had discovered a wonderful medicine. From Spain tobacco seed  was sent to France by Jean Nicot, in 1560. It is said that Sir Walter  Raleigh carried it to England in 1586, when Elizabeth was queen.    In a few years many civilized people were snuffing, chewing, and smoking  tobacco, like the wild Indians, although it cost them a great deal of money  to do so. King James does not seem to have liked it very much, for he said,  \"It is a custome loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the  brain, and dangerous to the lungs.\" He called the smoke \"stinking fumes.\"    _THE TOBACCO PLANT._ This plant belongs to the same family as the deadly  nightshade, henbane, belladonna, thorn-apple, Jerusalem cherry, potato,  tomato, egg-plant, cayenne pepper, bitter-sweet, and petunia. Most of the  plants of this Nightshade family have more or less poison in their leaves  or fruit. Tobacco is supposed to have been named from the pipe used by the  Indians in smoking its leaves.    The common tobacco plant grows from three to six feet high, and has large,  almost lance-shaped, leaves growing down the stems; its flowers are  funnel-shaped and of a purplish color. When fresh the leaves have very  little odor or taste.    _HOW TOBACCO IS USED._--When the plants are ripe, they are cut off above  the roots and placed where they will become dry, sometimes in a building  made for this purpose, called \"a tobacco house.\" After a short time they  begin to smell strong and taste bitter. They are then stripped from the  stems very carefully and sorted. The leaves nearest the root are considered  the poorest, those at the top generally the best.    The different sorts are packed in separate hogsheads, and sent away to be  sold to manufacturers of cigars, snuff, etc.    The manufacturer has some leaves rolled into cigars, some pressed into  cakes for chewing, or into little pieces to be smoked in a pipe; while some  are ground for snuff. While the dried leaves are being rolled, pressed, or  ground, various substances are mixed with them to give them an agreeable  odor and pleasant taste.    Yet, however pleasant the manufacturer may make them as he rolls, presses,  or grinds, he cannot take the poison out of them. It remains in its brown  covering to do much harm to those who may smoke the cigars, use the snuff,  or chew the tobacco.    BLACKBOARD OUTLINE.                              THE TOBACCO PLANT.
