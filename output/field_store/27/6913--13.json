They sailed toward this land, and came to an island which lay to the  northward off the land. There they went ashore and looked about them,  the weather being fine, and they observed that there was dew upon the  grass, and it so happened that they touched the dew with their hands,  and touched their hands to their mouths, and it seemed to them that they  had never before tasted anything so sweet as this. They went aboard  their ship again and sailed into a certain sound, which lay between the  island and a cape, which jutted out from the land on the north, and they  stood in westering past the cape. At ebb-tide there were broad reaches  of shallow water there, and they ran their ship aground there, and it  was a long distance from the ship to the ocean; yet were they so anxious  to go ashore that they could not wait until the tide should rise under  their ship, but hastened to the land, where a certain river flows out  from a lake. As soon as the tide rose beneath their ship, however, they  took the boat and rowed to the ship, which they conveyed up the river,  and so into the lake, where they cast anchor and carried their hammocks  ashore from the ship, and built themselves booths there. They afterwards  determined to establish themselves there for the winter, and they  accordingly built a large house. There was no lack of salmon there  either in the river or in the lake, and larger salmon than they had ever  seen before. The country thereabouts seemed to be possessed of such  good qualities that cattle would need no fodder there during the  winters. There was no frost there in the winters, and the grass withered  but little. The days and nights there were of more nearly equal length  than in Greenland or Iceland. On the shortest day of winter the sun was  up between \"eyktarstad\" and \"dagmalastad.\"[52-1] When they had completed  their house Leif said to his companions, \"I propose now to divide our  company into two groups, and to set about an exploration of the country;  one half of our party shall remain at home at the house, while the other  half shall investigate the land, and they must not go beyond a point  from which they can return home the same evening, and are not to  separate [from each other.]\" Thus they did for a time; Leif himself, by  turns, joined the exploring party or remained behind at the house. Leif  was a large and powerful man, and of a most imposing bearing, a man of  sagacity, and a very just man in all things.    _Leif the Lucky finds Men upon a Skerry at Sea._--It was discovered one  evening that one of their company was missing, and this proved to be  Tyrker, the German. Leif was sorely troubled by this, for Tyrker had  lived with Leif and his father for a long time, and had been very devoted  to Leif, when he was a child. Leif severely reprimanded his companions,  and prepared to go in search of him, taking twelve men with him. They had  proceeded but a short distance from the house, when they were met by  Tyrker, whom they received most cordially. Leif observed at once that his  foster-father was in lively spirits. Tyrker had a prominent forehead,  restless eyes, small features, was diminutive in stature, and rather a  sorry-looking individual withal, but was, nevertheless, a most capable  handicraftsman. Leif addressed him, and asked: \"Wherefore art thou so  belated foster-father mine, and astray from the others?\" In the beginning  Tyrker spoke for some time in German, rolling his eyes and grinning, and  they could not understand him; but after a time he addressed them in the  Northern tongue: \"I did not go much further [_than you_], and yet I have  something of novelty to relate. I have found vines and grapes.\" \"Is this  indeed true, foster-father?\" said Leif. \"Of a certainty it is true,\"  quoth he, \"for I was born where there is no lack of either grapes or  vines.\" They slept the night through, and on the morrow Leif said to his  shipmates: \"We will now divide our labors, and each day will either  gather grapes or cut vines and fell trees, so as to obtain a cargo of  these for my ship.\" They acted upon this advice, and it is said, that  their after-boat was filled with grapes. A cargo sufficient for the ship  was cut, and when the spring came, they made their ship ready, and sailed  away; and from its products Leif gave the land a name, and called it  Wineland. They sailed out to sea, and had fair winds until they sighted  Greenland, and the fells below the glaciers; then one of the men spoke  up, and said, \"Why do you steer the ship so much into the wind?\" Leif  answers: \"I have my mind upon my steering, but on other matters as well.  Do ye not see anything out of the common?\" They replied, that they saw  nothing strange. \"I do not know,\" says Leif, \"whether it is a ship or a  skerry that I see.\" Now they saw it, and said, that it must be a skerry;  but he was so much keener of sight than they, that he was able to discern  men upon the skerry. \"I think it best to tack,\" says Leif, \"so that we  may draw near to them, that we may be able to render them assistance, if  they should stand in need of it; and if they should not be peaceably  disposed, we shall still have better command of the situation than they.\"  They approached the skerry, and lowering their sail, cast anchor, and  launched a second small boat, which they had brought with them. Tyrker  inquired who was the leader of the party. He replied that his name was  Thori, and that he was a Norseman; \"but what is thy name?\" Leif gave his  name. \"Art thou a son of Eric the Red of Brattahlid?\" says he. Leif  responded that he was. \"It is now my wish,\" says Leif, \"to take you all  into my ship, and likewise so much of your possessions as the ship will  hold.\" This offer was accepted, and [with their ship] thus laden, they  held away to Ericsfirth, and sailed until they arrived at Brattahlid.  Having discharged the cargo, Leif invited Thori, with his wife, Gudrid,  and three others, to make their home with him, and procured quarters for  the other members of the crew, both for his own and Thori's men. Leif  rescued fifteen persons from the skerry. He was afterward called Leif the  Lucky. Leif had now goodly store both of property and honor. There was  serious illness that winter in Thori's party, and Thori and a great  number of his people died. Eric the Red also died that winter. There was  now much talk about Leif's Wineland journey, and his brother, Thorvald,  held that the country had not been sufficiently explored. Thereupon Leif  said to Thorvald: \"If it be thy will, brother, thou mayest go to Wineland  with my ship, but I wish the ship first to fetch the wood, which Thori  had upon the skerry.\" And so it was done.    _Thorvald goes to Wineland._--Now Thorvald, with the advice of his  brother, Leif, prepared to make this voyage with thirty men. They put  their ship in order, and sailed out to sea; and there is no account of  their voyage before their arrival at Leif's-booths in Wineland. They laid  up their ship there, and remained there quietly during the winter,  supplying themselves with food by fishing. In the spring, however,  Thorvald said that they should put their ship in order, and that a few  men should take the after-boat, and proceed along the western coast, and  explore [the region] thereabouts during the summer. They found it a fair,  well-wooded country; it was but a short distance from the woods to the  sea, and [there were] white sands, as well as great numbers of islands  and shallows. They found neither dwelling of man nor lair of beast; but  in one of the westerly islands, they found a wooden building for the  shelter of grain. They found no other trace of human handiwork, and they  turned back, and arrived at Leif's-booths in the autumn. The following  summer Thorvald set out toward the east with the ship, and along the  northern coast. They were met by a high wind off a certain promontory,  and were driven ashore there, and damaged the keel of their ship, and  were compelled to remain there for a long time and repair the injury to  their vessel. Then said Thorvald to his companions: \"I propose that we  raise the keel upon this cape, and call it Keelness,\" and so they did.  Then they sailed away, to the eastward off the land, and into the mouth  of the adjoining firth, and to a headland, which projected into the sea  there, and which was entirely covered with woods. They found an anchorage  for their ship, and put out the gangway to the land, and Thorvald and all  of his companions went ashore. \"It is a fair region here,\" said he, \"and  here I should like to make my home.\" They then returned to the ship, and  discovered on the sands, in beyond the headland, three mounds; they went  up to these, and saw that they were three skin-canoes, with three men  under each. They thereupon divided their party, and succeeded in seizing  all of the men but one, who escaped with his canoe. They killed the eight  men, and then ascended the headland again, and looked about them, and  discovered within the firth certain hillocks, which they concluded must  be habitations. They were then so overpowered with sleep that they could  not keep awake, and all fell into a [heavy] slumber, from which they were  awakened by the sound of a cry uttered above them; and the words of the  cry were these: \"Awake, Thorvald, thou and all thy company, if thou  wouldst save thy life; and board thy ship with all thy men, and sail with  all speed from the land!\" A countless number of skin-canoes then advanced  toward them from the inner part of the firth, whereupon Thorvald  exclaimed: \"We must put out the war-boards, on both sides of the ship,  and defend ourselves to the best of our ability, but offer little  attack.\" This they did, and the Skrellings, after they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18581"],[0,"Adrift in New York: Tom and Florence Braving the World (#14)"],[1,"was that Florence did make up her mind  the very next afternoon to seek her old home. She had just reached the  front steps, and was about to ascend, when the door opened and Curtis  appeared.    He started at sight of his cousin.    \"Florence!\" he said. \"Tell me why you came here?\"    \"I am anxious about my uncle,\" she said. \"Tell me, Curtis, how he is.\"    \"You know he's never in vigorous health,\" said Curtis, evasively.    \"But is he as well as usual?\"    \"He is about the same as ever. One thing would do more for him than  anything else.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"Your agreement to marry me,\" and he fixed his eyes upon her face  eagerly.    Florence shook her head.    \"I should be glad to help my uncle,\" she said, \"but I cannot agree to  marry you.\"    \"Why not?\" he demanded, roughly.    \"Because I do not love you, and never shall,\" she responded, firmly.    \"In other words, you refuse to do the only thing that will restore our  uncle to health and happiness?\"    \"It is too much to ask.\" Then, fixing her eyes upon him keenly: \"Why  should uncle insist upon this marriage? Is it not because you have  influenced him in the matter?\"    \"No,\" answered Curtis, falsely. \"He has some secret reason, which he  will not disclose to me, for desiring it.\"    Florence had learned to distrust the words of her wily cousin.    \"May I not see him?\" she asked. \"Perhaps he will tell me.\"    \"No; I cannot permit it.\"    \"You cannot permit it? Are you, then, our uncle's guardian?\"    \"No, and yes. I do not seek to control him, but I wish to save him  from serious agitation. Should he see you, and find that you are still  rebellious, the shock might kill him.\"    \"I have reason to doubt your words,\" said Florence, coldly. \"I think  you are resolved to keep us apart.\"    \"Listen, and I will tell you a secret; Uncle John has heart disease,  so the doctor assures me. Any unwonted agitation might kill him  instantly. I am sure you would not like to expose him to such a risk.\"    He spoke with apparent sincerity, but Florence did not feel certain  that his words were truthful.    \"Very well,\" she said. \"Then I will give up seeing him.\"    \"It is best, unless you are ready to accede to his wishes--and mine.\"    She did not answer, but walked away slowly.    \"It would never do to have them meet!\" muttered Curtis. \"The old  gentleman would ask her to come back on any terms, and then all my  scheming would be upset. That was a happy invention of mine, about  heart disease,\" he continued, with a low laugh. \"Though she only half  believed it, she will not dare to run the risk of giving him a shock.\"    It was about this time that the quiet tenor of Dodger's life was  interrupted by a startling event.    He still continued to visit the piers, and one afternoon about six  o'clock, he stood on the pier awaiting the arrival of the day boat  from Albany, with a small supply of evening papers under his arm.    He had sold all but half a dozen when the boat touched the pier. He  stood watching the various passengers as they left the boat and turned  their steps in different directions, when some one touched him on the  shoulder.    Looking up, he saw standing at his side a man of slender figure, with  gray hair and whiskers.    \"Boy,\" he said, \"I am a stranger in the city. Can I ask your  assistance?\"    \"Yes, sir; certainly,\" answered Dodger, briskly.    \"Do you know where the nearest station of the elevated road is?\"    \"Yes, sir?\"    \"I want to go uptown, but I know very little about the city. Will you  accompany me as guide? I will pay you well.\"    \"All right, sir,\" answered Dodger.    It was just the job he was seeking.    \"We will have to walk a few blocks, unless you want to take a  carriage.\"    \"It isn't necessary. I am strong, in spite of my gray hair.\"    And indeed he appeared to be.    Dodger noticed that he walked with the elastic step of a young man,  while his face certainly showed no trace of wrinkles.    \"I live in the West,\" said the stranger, as they walked along. \"I have  not been here for ten years.\"    \"Then you have never ridden on the elevated road?\" said Dodger.    \"N-no,\" answered the stranger, with curious hesitation.    Yet when they reached the station he went up the staircase and  purchased his ticket with the air of a man who was thoroughly  accustomed to doing it.    \"I suppose you don't want me any longer,\" said Dodger, preparing to  resign the valise he was carrying, and which, by the way, was  remarkably light considering the size.    \"Yes, I shall need you,\" said the other hurriedly. \"There may be some  distance to walk after we get uptown.\"    \"All right, sir.\"    Dodger was glad that further service was required, for this would of  course increase the compensation which he would feel entitled to ask.    They entered one of the cars, and sat down side by side.    The old gentleman drew a paper from his pocket, and began to read,  while Dodger, left to his own devices, sat quiet and looked about him.    He was rather surprised that the old gentleman, who, according to his  own representation, was riding upon the elevated road for the first  time, seemed to feel no curiosity on the subject, but conducted  himself in all respects like an experienced traveler.    \"He's a queer customer!\" thought Dodger. \"However, it's all one to me,  as long as he pays me well for the job.\"    They got out at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, and struck down  toward the river, Dodger carrying the valise.    \"I wonder where we're going?\" he asked himself.    At length they reached a wooden house of three stories, standing by  itself, and here the stranger stopped.    He rang the bell, and the door was opened by a hump-backed negro, who  looked curiously at Dodger.    \"Is the room ready, Julius?\" asked the old man.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Boy, take the valise upstairs, and I will follow you.\"    Up two flights of stairs walked Dodger, followed by the old man and  the negro.    The latter opened the door of a back room, and Dodger, obedient to  directions, took the valise inside and deposited it on a chair.    He had hardly done so when the door closed behind him, and he heard  the slipping of a bolt.    \"What does all this mean?\" Dodger asked himself in amazement.          Chapter XVIII.  In A Trap.      \"Hold on there! Open that door!\" he exclaimed, aloud.    There was no answer.    \"I say, let me out!\" continued our hero, beginning to kick at the  panels.    This time there was an answer.    \"Stop that kicking, boy! I will come back in fifteen minutes and  explain all.\"    \"Well,\" thought Dodger, \"this is about the strangest thing that ever  happened to me. However, I can wait fifteen minutes.\"    He sat down on a cane chair--there were two in the room--and looked  about him.    He was in an ordinary bedroom, furnished in the usual manner. There  was nothing at all singular in its appearance.    On a book shelf were a few books, and some old numbers of magazines.  There was one window looking into a back yard, but as the room was  small it was sufficient to light the apartment.    Dodger looked about in a cursory manner, not feeling any particular  interest in his surroundings, for he had but fifteen minutes to wait,  but he thought it rather queer that it should be thought necessary to  lock him in.    He waited impatiently for the time to pass.    Seventeen minutes had passed when he heard the bolt drawn. Fixing his  eyes eagerly on the door he saw it open, and two persons entered.    One was the hump-backed negro, carrying on a waiter a plate of  buttered bread, and a cup of tea; the other person was--not the old  man, but, to Dodger's great amazement, a person well-remembered,  though he had only seen him once--Curtis Waring.    \"Set down the waiter on the table, Julius,\" said Waring.    Dodger looked on in stupefaction. He was getting more and more  bewildered.    \"Now, you can go!\" said Curtis, in a tone of authority.    The negro bowed, and after he had disposed of the waiter, withdrew.    \"Do you know me, boy?\" asked Curtis, turning now and addressing  Dodger.    \"Yes; you are Mr. Waring.\"    \"You remember where you last saw me?\"    \"Yes, sir. At your uncle's house on Madison Avenue.\"    \"Quite right.\"    \"How did you come here? Where is the old man whose valise I brought  from the Albany boat?\"    Curtis smiled, and drew from his pocket a gray wig and whiskers.    \"You understand now, don't you?\"    \"Yes, sir; I understand that I have been got here by a trick.\"    \"Yes,\" answered Curtis, coolly. \"I have deemed it wise to use a little  stratagem. But you must be hungry. Sit down and eat your supper while  I am talking to you.\"    Dodger was hungry, for it was past his usual supper time, and he saw  no reason why he should not accept the invitation.    Accordingly, he drew his chair up to the table and began to eat.  Curtis seated himself on the other chair.    \"I have a few questions to ask you, and that is why I arranged this  interview. We are quite by ourselves,\" he added, significantly.    \"Very well, sir; go ahead.\"    \"Where is my Cousin Florence? I am right, I take it, in assuming that  you know where she is.\"    \"Yes, sir; I know,\" answered Dodger, slowly.    \"Very well, tell me.\"    \"I don't think she wants you to know.\"    Curtis frowned.    \"It is necessary I should know!\" he said, emphatically.    \"I will ask her if I may tell you.\"    \"I can't wait for that. You must tell me at once.\"    \"I can't do that.\"    \"You are mistaken; you can do it.\"    \"Then, I won't!\" said Dodger, looking his companion full in the face.    Curtis Waring darted a wicked look at him, and seemed ready to attack  the boy who was audacious enough to thwart him, but he restrained  himself and said:    \"Let that pass for the present. I have another question to ask. Where  is the document you took from my uncle's desk on the night of the  burglary?\"    And he emphasized the last word.    Dodger looked surprised.    \"I took no paper,\" he"]]]
