Indeed, the nickname of Commandant Jeniaux is  the native word meaning Father. All the sick are brought in and receive  treatment; children are vaccinated, and any little native disputes are  brought before him to settle. These nearly always relate to women. One  man will complain that his wife has not behaved herself properly at  home, that she has not prepared his food nicely, or much more rarely,  that she has run away with another. Sometimes a Chief complains that  another one has stolen some of his women or goats, and then the other  side is heard and the judgment pronounced. These are of course, not  formal trials, and the judgment is more in the shape of advice. It is  however, always acted upon, for the time being at least. Serious cases  are left to the Courts, but this institution of friendly palavers is an  excellent one and establishes confidence and good will among the  natives. It is here indeed, that the personal character of the white man  is put to the test. A calm, just, firm rule will win both the love and  respect of these over-grown children, but an excitable, harsh, uncertain  temper and manner, will only awaken distrust and hatred. The more  popular the head of the Station, the easier it is for him to find  workers in the villages, which in turn affect the general condition of  the country around. Although the system of work is absolutely uniform  and every official is tied in a particular groove, yet the whole  welfare, work, and indeed, appearance of the country and villages, is  good or bad according to the moral character and personality of the  chief white man in the neighbourhood. I would therefore, say, with  however some reserve, that when the natives are discontented and rebel,  it is not because they dislike the system of Government, but are  dissatisfied with the man who administers it.    [Illustration: NATIVE CHIEFS AT COQUILHATVILLE.]    On August 16th, Inspecteur d'Etat Warnant, Commander in-chief of the  Force Publique, arrives at Irebu. He is on a tour of inspection, and has  every reason to be satisfied with the efficiency of the troops. Perfect  discipline and harmony is maintained throughout all ranks and all the  officers are agreed that the troops are perfectly steady when fighting  and never show the least sign of cowardice. Many are very good shots and  their drill certainly leaves nothing to be desired.    On the same day Mr. Joseph Clarke, of the American Baptist Mission at  Ikoko, calls at Irebu and kindly invites me to his house for a few days.  This is situated on the banks of Lake Tumba, or Mantumba or Lac N'Tomba,  whichever you prefer. Lord Mountmorres remains at Irebu, but I leave in  Mr. Clarke's boat, propelled by twenty four paddlers, and journey along  the canal, which twists and turns in all directions. Towards sunset we  land at Boboko where Mr. Clarke buys some ducks and eggs, the price of  the latter being a table-spoonful of salt for each. He arranges also to  sell some nails to the Chief. We then cross the canal to Itutu, a branch  Mission Station conducted by a native who preaches, and is an excellent  carpenter. Here we sleep, Mr. Clarke making up a bed in the boat, while  I occupy a mud hut which however, is scrupulously clean.    Next morning, after a bathe in the canal, in which the water is like  warm, weak coffee, we continue our journey to Ngero, a long straggling  village on the north bank of the Lake. The huts here are oblong and  strongly constructed of hard cane and mud, the roofs being thatched with  dried palm leaves closely interlaced. It is necessary to stoop to enter  them, for the doors are not five feet high, but it is possible to stand  upright within. There is usually a wood fire burning, but no outlet for  the smoke, which slowly finds its way through the roof. The rafters  therefore, are covered with a kind of tar which, undoubtedly, acts as an  antiseptic, and also keeps away the insects. The mosquitoes indeed, will  not face wood smoke, but tobacco smoke is useless as a shield against  their attacks. Both sexes here are practically nude. The men are  fishermen and the women look after the banana-plantations, crush the  palm nuts for oil and do the cooking and housework.    Ngero was the village of the Chief Lokolo Longania, who raised a  rebellion against the State some years ago, and after some trouble was  captured and hanged. Here we buy some fish and eggs and then go on to  Ikoko, the crew singing native songs and Christian hymns as they paddle  along. The Mission house is very prettily situated, and is a wooden  building, with that very rare luxury in the Congo, glass windows. Here  we are met by Mrs. Clarke, who has spent many years with her husband in  Africa. The Mission has a good farm and garden, and since the climate is  not as bad as in many parts, its inmates enjoy fair health. A large  wooden building is used as a chapel and school, and near it is a saw pit  and a carpenter's shop where the boys make furniture and boxes for sale  at Irebu and other Posts in the neighbourhood, for the furniture of the  Ikoko Mission is quite famous. The girls all wear plain, blue frocks  which they make themselves, as well as clothes for sale, and many are  also quite expert at various kinds of fancy needlework. The business has  however, decreased lately owing to the decrease in population. The  Mission bell has been ingeniously fixed in a tree, and it calls to  school, to work and prayer, as regularly as the bugle in the State  Posts.    The village of Ikoko consists of groups of huts separated from each  other by the tall grass, which here is eighteen or twenty feet long, but  as the ends bend over, not above twelve or fifteen feet high. The people  seem idle, contented and happy, the chief industry being fishing and  net-making. Mr. Clarke said the population used to be about 2000 in  number, but many have died of Sleeping Sickness and some have migrated.  This is very evident, for a number of huts are deserted, and the weeds  have grown over them, in some cases entirely blocking the entrances. Out  of curiosity, we have a rough census taken and find there are 138 men in  the village on August 19th. Some no doubt are fishing, and allowing for  these and the women and children, there are probably not more than 1000  to 1200 people now living in the village. The work these do for the  State, consists of supplying 600 rations of fish per week to the  plantation of Bikoro, a ration consisting of a whole, a half, or a  quarter of a fish according to its size. For this they are paid 600  mitakos--or about 23/--. They also supply bamboos and baskets, but it is  very plain that if the people worked hard, they would certainly not  require as long as 40 hours a month to accomplish their tasks. The fish  are caught in nets made of thin bamboo lashed together by a tough  creeper, which are arranged in the lake. Sometimes it happens that the  fishermen are unfortunate and then they buy from their neighbours who  take advantage of the scarcity value and charge them more than they will  receive from the State. A village might thus be out of pocket by the  transaction, but as each one has its turn, probably by the end of the  year no one has lost or gained.    In the Mission school men, women, and children are learning to read and  write the native language, and some have mastered also the rudiments of  arithmetic and French. Some of the classes are held in the school-room  and others under trees near at hand. An assistant missionary, Mr.  Whitman, helps Mr. Clarke, while Mrs. Whitman teaches in the school.    On August 20th we start for Bikoro under a threatening sky. It is indeed  soon apparent that a tornado is crossing the Lake towards us, for great  banks of dense clouds advancing rapidly from the south west now obscure  the sun. It would be impossible to travel through the storm, so we turn  the boat and make for a creek which bounds Ikoko on the east. Only just  in time, we reach a native hut, as a terrific storm bursts overhead.  The rain descends in sheets accompanied by vivid green lightning and  crashes of thunder. Fortunately the roof is water-tight, but the mud  floor of the hut has worn down below the level of the ground outside and  soon the water pours through the door and is nine or ten inches deep  inside. The fire splutters out and the logs float around amid the  crowing of fowls and the cackling of ducks who are quite contented and  happy. Our hostess with a baby strapped on her back in the usual native  fashion, commences to bale out the water with a basket while we sit on  logs in the darkness and try to keep dry. After about an hour the storm  passes and we go back to the Mission, the Lake now appearing like a  small sea.    Mr. Clarke lends me a copy of the _Memorial concerning conditions in the  Independent State of the Congo_ which was presented to the American  Senate early in 1904. There seem to be a great many curious errors in  it. It starts with the astounding statement that the Congo Free State  has a sea board of 400 miles along the Atlantic, whereas a glance at the  map will show that it is really about a tenth as long. It estimates the  Force Publique at 30,000 men, rather more than twice its full strength,  and its author is under the impression that the people may not collect  the produce of the land or \"barter it for merchandise.\" It is a little  difficult to understand what the author means here. As a matter of fact,  the people are trading with each other, all day long and with the white  travellers whenever they have the opportunity. They sell food, lances,  native knives and all kinds of curiosities to those who desire them and  are at perfect liberty to barter away all their property if they wish to  do so. They may not of course enter the territories of the State or  Private Companies and take"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15250"],[0,"Myths and Legends of China (#14)"],[1,"of the same mysterious force from which  all things proceed.    It is unnecessary to follow this philosophy along all the different  branches which grew out of it, for we are here concerned only with  the seed. We have observed how Chinese dualism became a monism, and  how while the monism was established the dualism was retained. It is  this mono-dualistic theory, combining the older and newer philosophy,  which in China, then as now, constitutes the accepted explanation of  the origin of things, of the universe itself and all that it contains.      Lao Tzu's \"Tao\"    There are other cosmogonies in Chinese philosophy, but they need not  detain us long. Lao Tzu (sixth century B.C.), in his _Tao-te ching,  The Canon of Reason and Virtue_ (at first entitled simply _Lao Tzu_),  gave to the then existing scattered sporadic conceptions of the  universe a literary form. His _tao_, or 'Way,' is the originator  of Heaven and earth, it is \"the mother of all things.\" His Way,  which was \"before God,\" is but a metaphorical expression for the  manner in which things came at first into being out of the primal  nothingness, and how the phenomena of nature continue to go on,  \"in stillness and quietness, without striving or crying.\" Lao Tzu is  thus so far monistic, but he is also mystical, transcendental, even  pantheistic. The way that can be walked is not the Eternal Way; the  name that can be named is not the Eternal Name. The Unnameable is the  originator of Heaven and earth; manifesting itself as the Nameable,  it is \"the mother of all things.\" \"In Eternal Non-Being I see the  Spirituality of Things; in Eternal Being their limitation. Though  different under these two aspects, they are the same in origin;  it is when development takes place that different names have to be  used. It is while they are in the condition of sameness that the  mystery concerning them exists. This mystery is indeed the mystery  of mysteries. It is the door of all spirituality.\"    This _tao_, indefinable and in its essence unknowable, is \"the  fountain-head of all beings, and the norm of all actions. But it is  not only the formative principle of the universe; it also seems to be  primordial matter: chaotic in its composition, born prior to Heaven  and earth, noiseless, formless, standing alone in its solitude, and  not changing, universal in its activity, and unrelaxing, without being  exhausted, it is capable of becoming the mother of the universe.\" And  there we may leave it. There is no scheme of creation, properly so  called. The Unwalkable Way leads us to nothing further in the way of  a cosmogony.      Confucius's Agnosticism    Confucius (551-479 B.C.) did not throw any light on the problem of  origin. He did not speculate on the creation of things nor the end  of them. He was not troubled to account for the origin of man, nor  did he seek to know about his hereafter. He meddled neither with  physics nor metaphysics. There might, he thought, be something on  the other side of life, for he admitted the existence of spiritual  beings. They had an influence on the living, because they caused  them to clothe themselves in ceremonious dress and attend to the  sacrificial ceremonies. But we should not trouble ourselves about  them, any more than about supernatural things, or physical prowess,  or monstrosities. How can we serve spiritual beings while we do not  know how to serve men? We feel the existence of something invisible  and mysterious, but its nature and meaning are too deep for the  human understanding to grasp. The safest, indeed the only reasonable,  course is that of the agnostic--to leave alone the unknowable, while  acknowledging its existence and its mystery, and to try to understand  knowable phenomena and guide our actions accordingly.    Between the monism of Lao Tzu and the positivism of Confucius on  the one hand, and the landmark of the Taoistic transcendentalism of  Chuang Tzu (fourth and third centuries B.C.) on the other, we find  several \"guesses at the riddle of existence\" which must be briefly  noted as links in the chain of Chinese speculative thought on this  important subject.      Mo Tzu and Creation    In the philosophy of Mo Ti (fifth and fourth centuries B.C.),  generally known as Mo Tzu or Mu Tzu, the philosopher of humanism and  utilitarianism, we find the idea of creation. It was, he says, Heaven  (which was anthropomorphically regarded by him as a personal Supreme  Being) who \"created the sun, moon, and innumerable stars.\" His system  closely resembles Christianity, but the great power of Confucianism as  a weapon wielded against all opponents by its doughty defender Mencius  (372-289 B.C.) is shown by the complete suppression of the influence  of Mo Tzuism at his hands. He even went so far as to describe Mo Tzu  and those who thought with him as \"wild animals.\"      Mencius and the First Cause    Mencius himself regarded Heaven as the First Cause, or Cause of Causes,  but it was not the same personal Heaven as that of Mo Tzu. Nor does  he hang any cosmogony upon it. His chief concern was to eulogize the  doctrines of the great Confucius, and like him he preferred to let  the origin of the universe look after itself.      Lieh Tzu's Absolute    Lieh Tzu (said to have lived in the fifth century B.C.), one  of the brightest stars in the Taoist constellation, considered  this nameable world as having evolved from an unnameable absolute  being. The evolution did not take place through the direction of  a personal will working out a plan of creation: \"In the beginning  there was Chaos [_hun tun_]. It was a mingled potentiality of Form  [_hsing_], Pneuma [_ch'i_], and Substance [_chih_]. A Great Change  [_t'ai i_] took place in it, and there was a Great Starting [_t'ai  ch'u_] which is the beginning of Form. The Great Starting evolved a  Great Beginning [_t'ai shih_], which is the inception of Pneuma. The  Great Beginning was followed by the Great Blank [_t'ai su_], which  is the first formation of Substance. Substance, Pneuma, and Form  being all evolved out of the primordial chaotic mass, this material  world as it lies before us came into existence.\" And that which  made it possible for Chaos to evolve was the Solitary Indeterminate  (_i tu_ or the _tao_), which is not created, but is able to create  everlastingly. And being both Solitary and Indeterminate it tells us  nothing determinate about itself.      Chuang Tzu's Super-tao    Chuang Chou (fourth and third centuries B.C.), generally known  as Chuang Tzu, the most brilliant Taoist of all, maintained with  Lao Tzu that the universe started from the Nameless, but it was if  possible a more absolute and transcendental Nameless than that of  Lao Tzu. He dwells on the relativity of knowledge; as when asleep he  did not know that he was a man dreaming that he was a butterfly, so  when awake he did not know that he was not a butterfly dreaming that  he was a man. [10] But \"all is embraced in the obliterating unity of  the _tao_, and the wise man, passing into the realm of the Infinite,  finds rest therein.\" And this _tao_, of which we hear so much in  Chinese philosophy, was before the Great Ultimate or Grand Terminus  (_t'ai chi_), and \"from it came the mysterious existence of God  [_ti_]. It produced Heaven, it produced earth.\"      Popular Cosmogony still Personal or Dualistic    These and other cosmogonies which the Chinese have devised, though  it is necessary to note their existence in order to give a just idea  of their cosmological speculations, need not, as I said, detain us  long; and the reason why they need not do so is that, in the matter  of cosmogony, the P'an Ku legend and the _yin-yang_ system with its  monistic elaboration occupy virtually the whole field of the Chinese  mental vision. It is these two--the popular and the scientific--that  we mean when we speak of Chinese cosmogony. Though here and there a  stern sectarian might deny that the universe originated in one or the  other of these two ways, still, the general rule holds good. And I  have dealt with them in this order because, though the P'an Ku legend  belongs to the fourth century A.D., the _I ching_ dualism was not,  rightly speaking, a cosmogony until Chou Tun-i made it one by the  publication of his _T'ai chi t'u_ in the eleventh century A.D. Over  the unscientific and the scientific minds of the Chinese these two  are paramount.    Applying the general principles stated in the preceding chapter,  we find the same cause which operated to restrict the growth of  mythology in general in China operated also in like manner in this  particular branch of it. With one exception Chinese cosmogony is  non-mythological. The careful and studiously accurate historians  (whose work aimed at being _ex veritate_, 'made of truth'), the  sober literature, the vast influence of agnostic, matter-of-fact  Confucianism, supported by the heavy Mencian artillery, are  indisputable indications of a constructive imagination which grew too  quickly and became too rapidly scientific to admit of much soaring  into the realms of fantasy. Unaroused by any strong stimulus in  their ponderings over the riddle of the universe, the sober, plodding  scientists and the calm, truth-loving philosophers gained a peaceful  victory over the mythologists.        CHAPTER IV    The Gods of China      The Birth of the Soul    The dualism noted in the last chapter is well illustrated by the  Chinese pantheon. Whether as the result of the co-operation of the  _yin_ and the _yang_ or of the final dissolution of P'an Ku, human  beings came into existence. To the primitive mind the body and its  shadow, an object and its reflection in water, real life and dream  life, sensibility and insensibility (as in fainting, etc.), suggest the  idea of another life parallel with this life and of the doings of the  'other self' in it.
