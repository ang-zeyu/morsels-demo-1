And then this again:         There were a fair number of Belgian doctors, but no nurses       except the usual untrained French girls, almost no equipment,       and no place for clean surgery. We heard of a house containing       sixty-one men with no doctor or nurses--several died without       having received any medical aid at all. Mrs. ---- and I even       on the following Wednesday found four men lying on straw in a       shop with leg and foot wounds who had not been dressed since       Friday and had never been seen by a doctor. In addition there       were hundreds and hundreds of wounded who could walk trying to       find shelter in some corner, besides the many unwounded French       and Belgian soldiers quartered in the town.         As if this inferno of misery were not enough, there were added       the refugees! These were not Belgians, as I had imagined, but       French. It appears that both English and French armies have       to clear the civil population out of the whole fighting       area--partly to prevent spying and treachery, (which has been       a curse to both armies,) and partly because they would starve.       They are sent to Calais, and then by boat to Havre.         That first Sunday evening an endless procession flowed from       the station to the quays in the drenching rain. Each family       had a perambulator, (a surprisingly handsome one, too,) piled       with sticks of bread, a few bundles of goods, and, when we       peered inside, a couple of crying babies. There were few young       people; mostly it was whimpering, frightened-looking children       and wretched, bent old men and women. It seemed too bad to be       true; even when they brushed past us in the rain we could not       believe that their sodden figures were real. They were       dematerialized by misery in some odd way.         Some of them slept in skating rinks, trucks, some in the       Amiral Ganteaume. (One's senses could not realize that to the       horrors of exile these people had added those of shipwreck       next day.) Some certainly stood in the Booking Hall outside       our hotel all night through. This sort of thing went on all       the week, and was going on when we left.    Nevertheless, I was stirred agreeably by the imagination of the shells  smashing the Emden and the men inside the Emden, and when I read the  other day that the naval guns had destroyed over 4,000 men in the German  trenches about Middlekirche I remarked that we were \"doing well.\" It is  only on the whole that we who want to end war hate and condemn war; we  are constantly lapsing into fierceness, and if we forget this lurking  bellicosity and admiration for hard blows in our own nature then we  shall set about the task of making an end to it under hopelessly  disabling misconceptions. We shall underrate and misunderstand  altogether the very powerful forces that are against pacifist effort.    Let us consider first, then, the forces that are directly opposed to the  pacification of the world, the forces that will work openly and  definitely for the preservation of war as a human condition. And it has  to be remembered that the forces that are for a thing are almost always  more unified, more concentrated and effective than the forces that are  against it. We who are against war and want to stop it are against it  for a great multitude of reasons. There are other things in life that  we prefer, and war stops these other things. Some of us want to pursue  art, some want to live industrious lives in town or country, some would  pursue scientific developments, some want pleasures of this sort or  that, some would live lives of religion and kindliness, or religion and  austerity.    But we all agree in fixing our minds upon something else than war. And  since we fix our minds on other things, war becomes possible and  probable through our general inattention. We do not observe it, and  meanwhile the people who really care for war and soldiering fix their  minds upon it. They scheme how it shall be done, they scheme to bring it  about. Then we discover suddenly--as the art and social development, the  industry and pleasant living, the cultivation of the civil enterprise of  England, France, Germany, and Russia have discovered--that everything  must be pushed aside when the war thinkers have decided upon their game.  And until we of the pacific majority contrive some satisfactory  organization to watch the war-makers we shall never end war, any more  than a country can end crime and robbery without a police. Specialist  must watch specialist in either case. Mere expressions of a virtuous  abhorrence of war will never end war until the crack of doom.    The people who actually want war are perhaps never at any time very  numerous. Most people sometimes want war, and a few people always want  war. It is these last who are, so to speak, the living nucleus of the  war creature that we want to destroy. That liking for an effective smash  which gleamed out in me for a moment when I heard of the naval guns is  with them a dominating motive. It is not outweighed and overcome in them  as it is in me by the sense of waste, and by pity and horror and by love  for men who can do brave deeds and yet weep bitterly for misery and the  deaths of good friends. These war-lovers are creatures of a simpler  constitution. And they seem capable of an ampler hate.    You will discover, if you talk to them skillfully, that they hold that  war \"ennobles,\" and that when they say ennobles they mean that it is  destructive to the ten thousand things in life that they do not enjoy or  understand or tolerate, things that fill them, therefore, with envy and  perplexity--such things as pleasure, beauty, delicacy, leisure. In the  cant of modern talk you will find them call everything that is not crude  and forcible in life \"degenerate.\" But back to the very earliest  writings, in the most bloodthirsty outpourings of the Hebrew prophets,  for example, you will find that at the base of the warrior spirit is  hate for more complicated, for more refined, for more beautiful and  happier living.    The military peoples of the world have almost always been harsh and  rather stupid peoples, full of a virtuous indignation of all they did  not understand. The modern Prussian goes to war today with as supreme a  sense of moral superiority as the Arabs when they swept down upon Egypt  and North Africa. The burning of the library of Alexandria remains  forever the symbol of the triumph of a militarist \"culture\" over  civilization. This easy belief of the dull and violent that war \"braces\"  comes out of a real instinct of self-preservation against the subtler  tests of peace. This type of person will keep on with war if it can. It  is to politics what the criminal type is to social order; it will be  resentful and hostile to every attempt to fix up a pacific order in the  world.    This heavy envy which is the dominant characteristic of the pro-military  type is by no means confined to it. More or less it is in all of us. In  England one finds it far less frequently in professional soldiers than  among sedentary learned men. In Germany, too, the more uncompromising  and ferocious pro-militarism is to be found in the frock coats of the  professors. Just at present England is full of virtuous reprehension of  German military professors, but there is really no monopoly of such in  Germany, and before Germany England produced some of the most perfect  specimens of aggressive militarist conceivable. To read Froude upon  Ireland or Carlyle upon the Franco-German War is to savor this  hate-dripping temperament in its perfection.    Much of this literary bellicosity is pathological. Men overmuch in  studies and universities get ill in their livers and sluggish in their  circulations; they suffer from shyness, from a persuasion of excessive  and neglected merit, old maid's melancholy, and a detestation of all the  levities of life. And their suffering finds its vent in ferocious  thoughts. A vigorous daily bath, a complete stoppage of wine, beer,  spirits, and tobacco, and two hours of hockey in the afternoon would  probably make decently tolerant men of all these fermenting professional  militarists. Such a regimen would certainly have been the salvation of  both Froude and Carlyle. It would probably have saved the world from the  vituperation of the Hebrew prophets--those models for infinite mischief.    The extremist cases pass to the average case through insensible degrees.  We are all probably, as a species, a little too prone to intolerance,  and if we do in all sincerity mean to end war in the world we must  prepare ourselves for considerable exercises in restraint when strange  people look, behave, believe, and live in a manner different from our  own. The minority of permanently bitter souls who want to see  objectionable cities burning and men fleeing and dying form the real  strength in our occasional complicities.    The world has had its latest object lesson in the German abuse of  English and French as \"degenerates,\" of the Russians as \"Mongol hordes,\"  of the Japanese as \"yellow savages,\" but it is not only Germans who let  themselves slip into national vanity and these ugly hostilities to  unfamiliar life. The first line of attack against war must be an attack  upon self-righteousness and intolerance. These things are the germ of  uncompromising and incurable militarism everywhere.    Now, the attack upon self-righteousness and intolerance and the stern,  self-satisfied militarism that arises naturally out of these things is  to be made in a number of ways. The first is a sedulous propaganda of  the truth about war, a steadfast resolve to keep the pain of warfare  alive in the nerves of the careless, to keep the stench of war under the  else indifferent nose.

Several regiments of cavalry have been used as infantry, and, armed with  rifles, have rendered the most valuable services.    The artillery has displayed a superiority in the use of its admirable  material, which is recognized by the Germans themselves.      _LONDON, March 27, (Correspondence of The Associated Press.)--Further  installments of the French official review of the condition of the  French Army after six months of war have been obtained by The Associated  Press. The sixth installment deals with material, artillery, transport,  and supplies, and the seventh takes up the situation of the German Army  and makes an analysis of the German forces in the field and available  for service._    _The first chapter of the seventh installment, headed \"The German  Effort,\" opens with a statement as to the German forces at the beginning  of the campaign. The writer says:_    The military effort of Germany at the outset of the campaign exceeded  all anticipations. Her design was to crush the French Army in a few  weeks under a tremendous mass of troops. Nothing was neglected to bring  that mass together.    The number of German army corps in time of peace is twenty-five. When  war began the German General Staff put in the field on the two theatres  of operations: 1, as fighting troops, (active, reserve, Ersatz or  Landwehr,) sixty-one army corps; 2, as troops to guard communications  and territory, formations of the Landsturm.    In October six and a half new army corps made their appearance, plus a  division of sailors--in all seven corps. From the end of November to the  end of December there was only an insignificant increase, consisting of  the division of sailors. In January, 1915, the number of fighting  formations put into line by the German Army was therefore sixty-nine  army corps, divided as follows:    Active corps, twenty-five and a half; reserve corps, twenty-one and a  half; Ersatz brigades, six and a half; reserve corps of new formation,  seven and a half, and corps of Landwehr, eight and a half.      GERMANY'S GREAT INITIAL EFFORT.    The immense effort thus made by Germany explains itself very well, if,  having regard to the position of Germany at the opening of the war, one  considers that of the Allies. Germany desired to take advantage of the  circumstances which enabled her to make a simultaneous mobilization of  all her forces--a mobilization which the three allied armies could not  carry out so rapidly. Germany wished with the mass of troops to crush  first of all the adversary who appeared to her the most dangerous. This  effort, broken for the first time on the Marne, attained its maximum at  the moment of the battle of Flanders, in which more than fifty army  corps out of sixty-nine were pitted against the French, British, and  Belgian Armies.    Here also the method followed by Germany is easily comprehensible. At  the end of October the Russian danger was beginning to become pressing,  and it was necessary to win a decisive victory in the western theatre of  the war. It was imperative to give international opinion the impression  that Germany remained in that quarter mistress of operations. Finally,  it behooved her by this victory to gain the freedom to transport a large  number of army corps to Poland. We have seen that the battle of  Flanders, instead of being a success for Germany, was a marked defeat.  This defeat was fraught with results, and it dominates the present  position of the German Army. The plans above described of the German  mobilization, which had their justification in view of a prompt victory,  were calculated to become extremely perilous from the moment that that  victory failed to be gained.      INITIATIVE LOST BY GERMANY.    From that moment, in fact, Germany lost the initiative and the direction  of the war. And, furthermore, she was condemned to suffer the  counter-effects of the enormous and precipitate effort which she had  made in vain. From the point of view of her effectiveness and her  regimental cadres, (basic organization,) she had undergone a wastage  which her adversaries, on the other hand, had been able to save  themselves. She had, in the words of the proverb, put all her eggs in  one basket, and in spite of her large population she could no longer,  owing to the immediate and sterile abuse which she had made of her  resources, pretend to regain the superiority of numbers.    She was reduced to facing as best she could on both war fronts the  unceasingly increasing forces of the Allies. She had attained the  maximum of tension and had secured a minimum of results. She had thus  landed herself in a difficulty which will henceforward go on increasing  and which is made clear when the wastage which her army has suffered is  closely studied.      WASTAGE OF GERMAN EFFECTIVES.    _Chapter II. of this section of the review bears the headline \"Wastage  of German Effectives.\"_    The wastage of effectives is easy to establish, it says. We have for the  purpose two sources--the official lists of losses published by the  German General Staff and the notebooks, letters, and archives of  soldiers and officers killed and taken prisoners. These different  documents show that by the middle of January the German losses on the  two fronts were 1,800,000 men.    These figures are certainly less than the reality, because, for one  thing, the sick are not comprised, and, for another, the losses in the  last battle in Poland are not included. Let us accept them, however; let  us accept also that out of these 1,800,000 men 500,000--this is the  normal proportion--have been able to rejoin after being cured. Thus the  final loss for five months of the campaign has been 1,300,000 men, or  260,000 men per month. These figures agree exactly with what can be  ascertained when the variations of effectives in certain regiments are  examined.    It is certain that the majority of the German regiments have had to be  completely renewed. What, then, is the situation created by these  enormous losses?    _This question is answered by a statement headed \"German troops  available for 1915.\"_    The total of German formations known at the beginning of January, says  the review, represented in round numbers 4,000,000 men. According to the  official reports on German recruiting, the entire resources of Germany  in men amount to 9,000,000. But from these 9,000,000 have to be deducted  men employed on railways, in the police, and in certain administrations  and industries--altogether 500,000 men. The total resources available  for the war were therefore 8,500,000. Out of these about one-half, say  4,000,000, are now at the front. The definitive losses represent at  least 1,300,000 men. The available resources amounted, then, at the  beginning of January, to 3,200,000 men.      GERMANY'S RESERVES UNTRAINED.    Of what are these resources composed? Chiefly of men who were untrained  in time of peace, the trained reservists having almost all left the  depots for the front. It has, moreover, to be noted that out of these  3,200,000 men there are, according to the statistics, 800,000 who are  more than 39 years of age, and therefore of only mediocre military  value. Thus there remain 2,400,000. Finally, the category of the  untrained in peace comprises, according to the estimates of German  military authorities themselves, one-quarter of inefficients.    The really valuable resources capable of campaigning are therefore just  2,000,000. These men, comprising the 1915, 1916, and 1917 classes,  called out in anticipation, constitute--and this point cannot be too  strongly insisted upon--the total of available resources for the  operations during the twelve months of 1915. As to what the military  value of these troops will be, considering the haste with which they  have been trained, the formidable losses sustained in the battle of  Flanders by the newly formed corps show very clearly. Their military  value will be limited.      GERMAN LOSSES 260,000 A MONTH.    When it is remembered that, according to the German documents  themselves, the definite loss each month is 260,000 men, it is manifest  that the available resources for the year 1915 will not suffice to fill  the gaps of a war of ten months.    It is then superabundantly established that in the matter of effectives  Germany has reached the maximum of possible effort. If with the men at  present available she creates, as it is certain that she is preparing to  do at this moment, fresh formations, she will be preventing herself, if  the war lasts another ten months, as is admissible, from being able to  complete afresh her old formations. If she creates no new formations,  she will have in 1915 exactly what is necessary and no more to complete  the existing units afresh.    Bearing in mind the ways of the German General Staff, one may suppose  that, disregarding the eventual impossibility of recompleting, it is  still addressing itself to creating new formations. The weakness to  which Germany will expose herself in the matter of effectives has just  been set forth, and it is easy to show that this weakness will be still  further aggravated by the wastage in the regimental orders.      PRAISES FRENCH \"SEVENTY-FIVES.\"    _In the sixth installment, beginning with the field gun, the famous  \"seventy-fives,\" the compiler of the report, after rehearsing the  splendid qualities of this weapon--its power, its rapidity of action,  and its precision--points out that it possesses a degree of strength and  endurance which makes it an implement of war of the first order._    It may be stated without hesitation [says the review] that our  \"seventy-five\" guns are in as perfect condition today as they were on  the first day of the war, although the use made of them has exceeded all  calculations.
