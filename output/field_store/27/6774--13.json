It would create a  great love for good music in the smaller cities and towns where people  hear so little, and so seldom this kind of music. You do so much for  music in every other style, but not for opera. Of course I must except  the half dozen cities large enough and rich enough to be favored with a  season of extended operatic performances; these are the real music  centers of your country.    \"I will show you what we do for opera in Italy. Here is an Italian  musical journal, which I have just received.\" Mr. Martinelli took up a  single-sheet newspaper which lay upon his desk. \"You will find all the  large cities and most of the small ones reported here. Accordingly,  accounts are given of what works are being performed, what artists are  singing and where, and how long each season will last. Thus we can  glance over the whole field and keep in touch with every singer.  Naturally, the time and length of the seasons of performance differ  widely in the different places. Thus a singer of reputation can make  engagements in various places, then go from one town to another in a  complete tour, without conflicting.    \"I have had the pleasure of singing a number of seasons at the  Metropolitan. During the summer I do not always go back to Italy when  the season is over here; last year I sang in Buenos Aires. This keeps  me at work the whole year. Buenos Aires is a beautiful city, and reminds  one of Milan. Yes, I like New York. It is more commercial, of course,  but I have grown accustomed to that side of it.\"    As the visitor was leaving, courteously conducted through the corridor  by Mr. Martinelli, a small chariot was encountered, crammed with dolls  and toys, the whole belonging to little Miss Martinelli, aged eleven  months.    \"Shall you make a singer of the little lady?\" the artist was asked.    \"Ah, no; one singer in a family is enough,\" was the quick response. \"But  who can tell? It may so happen, after all.\"          XII    =ANNA CASE=    INSPIRED INTERPRETATION      Anna Case, known from one end of our land to the other, in song recital,  is surely one hundred per cent. American. She was born in the little  State of New Jersey, and received her entire vocal training right here  in New York City, of a single teacher. No running about from one  instructor to another, \"getting points\" from each, for this singer. She  knew from the first moment that she had found the right teacher, one who  understood her, what she wanted to do, and could bring her to the goal.    And when one has discovered just the right person to develop talent, one  should have the good sense and loyalty to stick to that person. This is  exactly what Miss Case has done, for along with other gifts she has the  best gift of all--common sense. \"Mme. Ostrom-Renard has been my only  teacher,\" she says; \"whatever I am or have accomplished I owe entirely  to her. She has done everything for me; I feel she is the most wonderful  teacher in the world.\"    [Illustration: ANNA CASE]    A life of constant travel and almost daily concerts and recitals, lies  before Miss Case from early in the Autumn to the end of Spring, with but  a few breathing places here and there, between the tours, when she  returns home to rest up.    During one of these oases it was a pleasant experience to meet and talk  with the charming young singer, in her cozy New York apartment. She had  just come in from a six weeks' trip, which had included concerts in  Texas and Mexico, where the usual success had attended her everywhere.    It must surely give a sense of relief to know that the quiet home is  awaiting one's return; that there are to be found one's favorite books,  music, piano, the silken divan, soft lights, pictures,--all the familiar  comforts one is deprived of on the road.    The visitor, coming in from the biting winds without, was impressed with  the comfort and warmth of the small salon, as the mistress of it  entered. Clad in soft draperies of dull blue, which but thinly veiled  the white arms and fell away from the rounded throat, Miss Case was just  as beautiful to look upon as when she stands in bewildering evening gown  before a rapt audience. And, what is much more to the point, she is a  thoroughly sensible, sincere American girl, with no frills and no  nonsense about her.    After greetings were over, the singer settled herself among the silken  cushions of her divan ready for our talk.    \"I believe I always wanted to sing, rather than do anything else in the  way of music. I studied the piano a little at first, but that did not  exactly appeal to me. I also began the violin, because my father is fond  of that instrument and wanted me to play it. But the violin was not just  what I wanted either, for all the time I longed to sing. Singing is such  a part of one's very self; I wanted to express myself through it. I had  no idea, when I started, that I should ever make a specialty of it, or  that, in a comparatively few years I should be singing all over the  country. I did not know what was before me, I only wanted to learn to  sing.    \"Now I cannot tell just how I do the different things one must do to  sing correctly. I know that, if I have to master some subject, I just  sit down and work at that thing till I can do it--till it is done. My  teacher knows every organ in the anatomy, and can describe the muscles,  bones and ligaments found in the head, face and throat. She can make a  diagram of the whole or any part. Not that such knowledge is going to  make a singer, but it may help in directing one's efforts.\"      TONE PLACEMENT    \"Can you describe tone placement?\" she was asked.    \"For the deeper tones--as one makes them--they seem to come from lower  down: for the middle and higher tones, you feel the vibrations in facial  muscles and about the eyes, always focused forward, just at the base of  the forehead, between the eyes. It is something very difficult to put  into words; the sensations have to be experienced, when making the  tones. The singer must judge so much from sensation, for she cannot very  well hear herself. I do not really hear myself; I mean by this I cannot  tell the full effect of what I am doing.\"      WHEN TO PRACTICE    \"No doubt you do much practice--or is that now necessary?\"    Miss Case considered this thoughtfully.    \"I never practice when I am tired, for then it does more harm than good.  It is much better for the voice to rest and not use it at all, than to  sing when not physically fit. One must be in good condition to make  good tones; they will not be clear and perfect if one is not strong and  in good health. I can really study, yet not sing at all. For the whole  work is mental anyway.      USING FULL VOICE    \"When I work on the interpretation of a song, in the quiet of my music  room here, I try to sing it just as I would before an audience; I have  not two ways of doing it, one way for a small room and another for a  large one. If your tone placement is correct, and you are making the  right effects, they will carry equally in a large space. At least this  is my experience. But,\" she added, smiling, \"you may find other artists  who would not agree to this, who would think quite differently. Each one  must see things her own way; and singing is such an individual thing  after all.      THE SUBJECT OF INTERPRETATION    \"The interpretation of a role, or song, is everything--of course. What  are mere notes and signs compared to the thoughts expressed through  them? Yet it is evident there are people who don't agree to this, for  one hears many singers who never seem to look deeper than the printed  page. They stand up and go through their songs, but the audiences  remain cold; they are not touched. The audiences are blamed for their  apathy or indifference, but how can they be warmed when the singer does  not kindle them into life?    \"To me there is a wonderful bond of sympathy between the audience and  myself. I feel the people, in a sense, belong to me--are part of my  family. To them I pour out all my feelings--my whole soul. All the  sorrow of the sad songs, all the joy of the gay ones, they share with  me. In this spirit I come before them; they feel this, I am sure. It  awakens a response at once, and this always inspires me. I put myself in  a receptive mood; it has the desired effect; my interpretation becomes  inspired through their sympathy and my desire to give out to them.      THE WORDS OF A SONG PARAMOUNT    \"I feel the greatest thing about a song is the words. They inspired the  music, they were the cause of its being. I cannot imagine, when once  words have been joined to music, how other words can be put to the same  music, without destroying the whole idea. The words must be made plain  to the audience. Every syllable should be intelligible, and understood  by the listener. I feel diction is so absolutely essential. How can a  singer expect the audience will take an interest in what she is doing,  if they have no idea what it is all about? And this applies not only to  English songs but to those in French as well. In an audience there will  be many who understand French. Shall the singer imagine she can  pronounce a foreign tongue in any old way, and it will go--in these  days? No, she must be equally careful about all diction and see that it  is as nearly perfect as she can make it; that it is so correct that  anybody can understand every word. When she can do this, she has gone a  long way toward carrying her audience with her when she sings.    \"When the diction is satisfactory, there is yet something much deeper;  it is the giving out of one's best thought, one's best self, which  must animate the song and carry it home to the listener. It touches  the heart, because it comes from one's very inmost being. I am a  creature of mood. I cannot sing unless I feel like it. I must be  inspired in order to give an interpretation that shall be worth"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15464"],[0,"Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them (1918) (#14)"],[1,"peas, green beans,    Potatoes and root vegetables.

If from each of these groups the housekeeper, when buying, chooses  the lowest-cost food, she will provide the necessary nutriment for the  least expenditure of money. In war time such marketing is essential.    Other causes of waste in food purchasing may be enumerated as follows:  Ordering by telephone. This permits the butcher or grocer, who has  no time to make selection of foods, to send what comes ready to hand;  whereas if the housekeeper did her own selecting, she could take  advantage of special prices or \"leaders\"--food sold at cost or nearly  cost to attract patronage.    Buying out-of-season foods also makes marketing costly. Through  lack of knowledge concerning the periods at which certain fruits and  vegetables are seasonable, and therefore cheaper and in best flavor,  housekeepers frequently pay exorbitant prices for poor flavored,  inferior products.    Buying in localities where high rental and neighborhood standards  compel the shopkeeper to charge high prices, the consumer pays not  only for the rent and the plate glass windows, but for display of  out-of-season delicacies, game and luxury-foods. Markets should be  selected where food in season is sold; where cleanliness and careful  attention prevail rather than showy display.    Many a dollar is foolishly spent for delicatessen foods. The retail  cost of ready prepared foods includes a fraction of the salary of the  cook and the fuel, as well as the regular percentage of profit. The  food, also, is not so nourishing or flavorsome as if freshly cooked in  the home kitchen.    Buying perishable foods in larger quantities than can be used  immediately. Too frequently meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, milk and  cream are purchased in quantities larger than needed for immediate  consumption, and lack of knowledge of use of left-overs causes what is  not eaten to be discarded.    Buying non-perishable foods in small quantities instead of in bulk.  Food costs on an average 50 to 75 per cent. more when purchased in  small quantities. Select a grocer who keeps his goods in sanitary  condition and who will sell in bulk; then do your purchasing from him  on a large scale and extend the sanitary care to your own storeroom.    Buying foods high in price but low in food value. Asparagus, canned  or fresh, is not as nourishing, for instance, as canned corn or beans.  Strawberries out of season do not compare with dates, figs or raisins  which are to be had at all times.    Buying without planning menus. By this carelessness foods are often  purchased which do not combine well, and therefore do not appeal  to the appetite, and so are wasted. Unplanned meals also lead to an  unconscious extravagance in buying and an unnecessary accumulation of  left-overs.    Buying foreign brands when domestic brands are cheaper and often  better.    Leaving the trimmings from meats and poultry at the butcher's. Bring  these home and fry out the fatty portions for dripping; use all other  parts for the stock pot.    Having purchased for nutriment and in sufficiently large quantities to  secure bulk rates, careful storage is the next step in the prevention  of waste. Flour, cereals and meals become wormy if they are not kept  in clean, covered utensils and in a cool place. Milk becomes sour,  especially in summer. This can be prevented by scalding it as soon  as received, cooling quickly, and storing in a cold place in covered,  well-scalded receptacles. Sour milk should not be thrown out. It  is good in biscuits, gingerbread, salad dressings, cottage cheese,  pancakes or waffles, and bread making.    Meats should not be left in their wrappings. Much juice soaks into the  paper, which causes a loss of flavor and nutriment. Store all meat in  a cool place and do not let flies come in contact with it.    Bread often molds, especially in warm, moist weather. Trim off moldy  spots and heat through. Keep the bread box sweet by scalding and  sunning once a week.    Cheese molds. Keep in a cool, dry place. If it becomes too dry for  table use, grate for sauces or use in scalloped dishes.    Winter vegetables wilt and dry out. Store in a cool place. If cellar  space permits, place in box of sand, sawdust or garden earth.    Potatoes and onions sprout. Cut off the sprouts as soon as they appear  and use for soup. Soak, before using, vegetables which have sprouted.    Fruits must be stored carefully so as to keep the skins unbroken.  Broken spots in the skin cause rapid decay. Do not permit good fruit  to remain in contact with specked or rotted fruit. Stored fruit should  be looked over frequently and all specked or rotted fruit removed.  Sweet potatoes are an exception. Picking over, aggravates the trouble.  See that these vegetables are carefully handled at all times; if rot  develops, remove only those that can be reached without danger of  bruising the sound roots. Sweet potatoes may also be stored like fruit  by spreading over a large surface and separating the tubers so that  they do not touch each other.    Berries should be picked over as soon as received and spread on a  platter or a large surface to prevent crushing and to allow room for  circulation of air.    Lettuce and greens wilt. Wash carefully as soon as received and use  the coarse leaves for soup. Shake the water from the crisp portions  and store in a paper bag in a cold refrigerator.    Lemons when cut often grow moldy before they are used. When lemons are  spoiling, squeeze out the juice, make a syrup of one cup of sugar and  one cup of water, boil ten minutes and add lemon juice in any amount  up to one cup. Bring to boiling point and bottle for future use. This  bottled juice may be used for puddings, beverages, etc. If only a  small amount of juice is needed, prick one end of a lemon with a fork.  Squeeze out the amount needed and store the lemon in the ice-box.    When we come to waste caused by careless preparation we may be  reminded of the miracle of the loaves and fishes--how all the guests  were fed and then twelve baskets were gathered up. Often after  preparation that which is gathered up to be thrown away is as large in  quantity and as high in food value as the portions used.    Vegetables are wasted in preparation by too thick paring, the  discarding of coarse leaves such as are found on lettuce, cabbage and  cauliflower, discarding wilted parts which can be saved by soaking,  throwing away tips and roots of celery and the roots and ends of  spinach and dandelions. All these waste products can be cooked tender,  rubbed through a sieve and used with stock for vegetable soup, or with  skimmed milk for cream soup. Such products are being conserved by  the enemy, even to the onion skin, which is ground into bread-making  material.    Throwing away the water in which vegetables have been cooked wastes  their characteristic and valuable element--the mineral salts. Cooking  them so much that they become watery; under-cooking so that they  are hard and indigestible; cooking more than is required for a meal;  failing to use left-over portions promptly as an entree or for cream  soups or scalloped dishes--all these things mean an appalling waste of  valuable food material. Good food material is also lost when the water  in which rice or macaroni or other starchy food has been boiled is  poured down the kitchen sink. Such water should be used for soup  making.    Fruits are wasted by throwing away the cores and skins, which can be  used for making sauces, jams and jellies, the latter being sweetened  with corn syrup instead of sugar.    Rhubarb is wasted by removing the pink skin from young rhubarb, which  should be retained to add flavor and color-attractiveness to the dish.    Raw food in quantity is frequently left in the mixing bowl, while  by the use of a good flexible knife or spatula every particle can  be saved. A large palette knife is as good in the kitchen as in the  studio.           *       *       *       *       *    The next step in food preparation is cooking, and tons of valuable  material are wasted through ignorance of the principles of cooking.    Bad cooking, which means under-cooking, over-cooking or flavorless  cooking, renders food inedible, and inedible food contributes to world  shortage. Fats are wasted in cooking by being burned and by not being  carefully utilized as dripping and shortening. The water in which salt  meat, fresh meat, or poultry has been boiled should be allowed to cool  and the fat removed before soup is made of it. Such fat can be used,  first of all, in cooking, and then any inedible portions can be used  in soap making.           *       *       *       *       *    Tough odds and ends of meat not sightly enough to appear on the table  are often wasted. They can be transformed by long cooking into savory  stews, ragouts, croquettes and hashes, whereas, if carelessly and  insufficiently cooked, they are unpalatable and indigestible. Scraps  of left-over cooked meat should be ground in the food-chopper and made  into appetizing meat balls, hashes or sandwich paste. If you happen to  have a soft cooked egg left over, boil it hard at once. It can be used  for garnishes, sauces, salads or sandwich paste.           *       *  "]]]
