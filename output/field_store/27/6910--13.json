He was unwilling to alter what he had once printed: his friends,  classic, titled, and rustic, found him stubborn and unpliable, in  matters of criticism; yet he was generally of a complimental mood: he  loaded the robe of Coila in the \"Vision,\" with more scenes than it  could well contain, that he might include in the landscape, all the  country-seats of his friends, and he gave more than their share of  commendation to the Wallaces, out of respect to his friend Mrs.  Dunlop. Of the critics of Edinburgh he said, they spun the thread of  their criticisms so fine that it was unfit for either warp or weft;  and of its scholars, he said, they were never satisfied with any  Scottish poet, unless they could trace him in Horace. One morning at  Dr. Blair's breakfast-table, when the \"Holy Fair\" was the subject of  conversation, the reverend critic said, \"Why should        '--Moody speel the holy door          With tidings of _salvation_?'    if you had said, with tidings of _damnation_, the satire would have  been the better and the bitterer.\" \"Excellent!\" exclaimed the poet,  \"the alteration is capital, and I hope you will honour me by allowing  me to say in a note at whose suggestion it was made.\" Professor  Walker, who tells the anecdote, adds that Blair evaded, with equal  good humour and decision, this not very polite request; nor was this  the only slip which the poet made on this occasion: some one asked him  in which of the churches of Edinburgh he had received the highest  gratification: he named the High-church, but gave the preference over  all preachers to Robert Walker, the colleague and rival in eloquence  of Dr. Blair himself, and that in a tone so pointed and decisive as to  make all at the table stare and look embarrassed. The poet confessed  afterwards that he never reflected on his blunder without pain and  mortification. Blair probably had this in his mind, when, on reading  the poem beginning \"When Guildford good our pilot stood,\" he  exclaimed, \"Ah! the politics of Burns always smell of the smithy,\"  meaning, that they were vulgar and common.    In April, the second or Edinburgh, edition was published: it was  widely purchased, and as warmly commended. The country had been  prepared for it by the generous and discriminating criticisms of Henry  Mackenzie, published in that popular periodical, \"The Lounger,\" where  he says, \"Burns possesses the spirit as well as the fancy of a poet;  that honest pride and independence of soul, which are sometimes the  muse's only dower, break forth on every occasion, in his works.\" The  praise of the author of the \"Man of Feeling\" was not more felt by  Burns, than it was by the whole island: the harp of the north had not  been swept for centuries by a hand so forcible, and at the same time  so varied, that it awakened every tone, whether of joy or woe: the  language was that of rustic life; the scenes of the poems were the  dusty barn, the clay-floored reeky cottage, and the furrowed field;  and the characters were cowherds, ploughmen, and mechanics. The volume  was embellished by a head of the poet from the hand of the now  venerable Alexander Nasmith; and introduced by a dedication to the  noblemen and gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt, in a style of vehement  independence, unknown hitherto in the history of subscriptions. The  whole work, verse, prose, and portrait, won public attention, and kept  it: and though some critics signified their displeasure at expressions  which bordered on profanity, and at a license of language which they  pronounced impure, by far the greater number united their praise to  the all but general voice; nay, some scrupled not to call him, from  his perfect ease and nature and variety, the Scottish Shakspeare. No  one rejoiced more in his success and his fame, than the matron of  Mossgiel.    Other matters than his poems and socialities claimed the attention of  Burns in Edinburgh. He had a hearty relish for the joyous genius of  Allan Ramsay; he traced out his residences, and rejoiced to think that  while he stood in the shop of his own bookseller, Creech, the same  floor had been trod by the feet of his great forerunner. He visited,  too, the lowly grave of the unfortunate Robert Fergusson; and it must  be recorded to the shame of the magistrates of Edinburgh, that they  allowed him to erect a headstone to his memory, and to the scandal of  Scotland, that in such a memorial he had not been anticipated. He  seems not to have regarded the graves of scholars or philosophers; and  he trod the pavements where the warlike princes and nobles had walked  without any emotion. He loved, however, to see places celebrated in  Scottish song, and fields where battles for the independence of his  country had been stricken; and, with money in his pocket which his  poems had produced, and with a letter from a witty but weak man, Lord  Buchan, instructing him to pull birks on the Yarrow, broom on the  Cowden-knowes, and not to neglect to admire the ruins of Drybrugh  Abbey, Burns set out on a border tour, accompanied by Robert Ainslie,  of Berrywell. As the poet had talked of returning to the plough, Dr.  Blair imagined that he was on his way back to the furrowed field, and  wrote him a handsome farewell, saying he was leaving Edinburgh with a  character which had survived many temptations; with a name which would  be placed with the Ramsays and the Fergussons, and with the hopes of  all, that, in a second volume, on which his fate as a poet would very  much depend, he might rise yet higher in merit and in fame. Burns, who  received this communication when laying his leg over the saddle to be  gone, is said to have muttered, \"Ay, but a man's first book is  sometimes like his first babe, healthier and stronger than those which  follow.\"    On the 6th of May, 1787, Burns reached Berrywell: he recorded of the  laird, that he was clear-headed, and of Miss Ainslie, that she was  amiable and handsome--of Dudgeon, the author of \"The Maid that tends  the Goats,\" that he had penetration and modesty, and of the preacher,  Bowmaker, that he was a man of strong lungs and vigorous remark. On  crossing the Tweed at Coldstream he took off his hat, and kneeling  down, repeated aloud the two last verses of the \"Cotter's Saturday  Night:\" on returning, he drunk tea with Brydone, the traveller, a man,  he said, kind and benevolent: he cursed one Cole as an English  Hottentot, for having rooted out an ancient garden belonging to a  Romish ruin; and he wrote of Macdowal, of Caverton-mill, that by his  skill in rearing sheep, he sold his flocks, ewe and lamb, for a couple  of guineas each: that he washed his sheep before shearing--and by his  turnips improved sheep-husbandry; he added, that lands were generally  let at sixteen shillings the Scottish acre; the farmers rich, and,  compared to Ayrshire, their houses magnificent. On his way to Jedburgh  he visited an old gentleman in whose house was an arm-chair, once the  property of the author of \"The Seasons;\" he reverently examined the  relic, and could scarcely be persuaded to sit in it: he was a warm  admirer of Thomson.    In Jedburgh, Burns found much to interest him: the ruins of a splendid  cathedral, and of a strong castle--and, what was still more  attractive, an amiable young lady, very handsome, with \"beautiful  hazel eyes, full of spirit, sparkling with delicious moisture,\" and  looks which betokened a high order of female mind. He gave her his  portrait, and entered this remembrance of her attractions among his  memoranda:--\"My heart is thawed into melting pleasure, after being so  long frozen up in the Greenland bay of indifference, amid the noise  and nonsense of Edinburgh. I am afraid my bosom has nearly as much  tinder as ever. Jed, pure be thy streams, and hallowed thy sylvan  banks: sweet Isabella Lindsay, may peace dwell in thy bosom  uninterrupted, except by the tumultuous throbbings of rapturous love!\"  With the freedom of Jedburgh, handsomely bestowed by the magistrates,  in his pocket, Burns made his way to Wauchope, the residence of Mrs.  Scott, who had welcomed him into the world as a poet in verses lively  and graceful: he found her, he said, \"a lady of sense and taste, and  of a decision peculiar to female authors.\" After dining with Sir  Alexander Don, who, he said, was a clever man, but far from a match  for his divine lady, a sister of his patron Glencairn, he spent an  hour among the beautiful ruins of Dryburgh Abbey; glanced on the  splendid remains of Melrose; passed, unconscious of the future, over  that ground on which have arisen the romantic towers of Abbotsford;  dined with certain of the Souters of Selkirk; and visited the old keep  of Thomas the Rhymer, and a dozen of the hills and streams celebrated  in song. Nor did he fail to pay his respects, after returning through  Dunse, to Sir James Hall, of Dunglass, and his lady, and was much  pleased with the scenery of their romantic place. He was now joined by  a gentleman of the name of Kerr, and crossing the Tweed a second time,  penetrated into England, as far as the ancient town of Newcastle,  where he smiled at a facetious Northumbrian, who at dinner caused the  beef to be eaten before the broth was served, in obedience to an  ancient injunction, lest the hungry Scotch should come and snatch it.  On his way back he saw, what proved to be prophetic of his own  fortune--the roup of an unfortunate farmer's stock: he took out his  journal, and wrote with a troubled brow, \"Rigid economy, and decent  industry, do you preserve me from being the principal _dramatis  personae_, in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18505"],[0,"A Popular Schoolgirl (#14)"],[1,"ncy, Ingred struggled through the reeds  to the very edge of the river, and lifted up her voice in an agonized  cry of \"Help!\"    A punt was drifting slowly with the current, and its occupants, a lady  and gentleman, looked with surprise at the agitated girl who was hailing  them from the bank. The gentleman at once paddled in her direction, and,  running his little craft among the reeds, inquired what was the matter.    \"Oh, please, is that Waverley over there?\" asked Ingred anxiously.  \"We've lost our way, and we've walked miles! Is there any bridge near?\"    \"That's certainly Waverley, but there's no bridge till you come to one a  mile and a half down stream.\"    Ingred's face was tragic. She turned to Beatrice and Verity, who had  joined her.    \"It's no use! We shall have to go back!\"    But the lady was whispering something to the gentleman, and he beckoned  to the girls with a smile.    \"Don't run away!\" he said. \"Look here, we'll punt you across if you  like.\"    \"Like!\" The girls hardly knew how to express their gratitude.    \"The three of you'd be too heavy a load. I think I'd better take just  one at a time. Can you manage to get in? It's rather swampy here. Give  me your hand!\"    Ingred splashed ankle deep in oozy mud as she scrambled on board, but  that was a trifle compared with the relief of being ferried over the  river. Her knight-errant was neither young nor handsome, being, indeed,  rather bald and stout, but no orthodox interesting hero of fiction could  have been more welcome at the moment. She tendered her utmost thanks as  she landed, again with damage to her shoes, on the rushy bank opposite.  Their friends in need, having successfully punted over Beatrice and  Verity also, bade them a laughing good-bye, and resumed their easy  course down stream, leaving three very grateful girls behind them.    [Illustration: A FRIEND IN NEED]    \"That's helped us out of a fix! Don't say again we've no luck!\" cried  Beatrice, wiping her boots carefully on the grass.    \"They were angels in disguise!\" sighed Ingred.    \"Rather stout angels!\" chuckled Verity. \"Now, how are we going to get  out of this field?\"    \"Over the hedge, I suppose. There's a piece of fence that looks  climbable!\" returned Beatrice, swinging herself up with elephantine  grace, and dropping with a heavy thud on the other side. \"Oh! good biz!  We're on a cinder path!\"    They were indeed in a back lane which led at the bottom of some gardens,  then behind a row of stables, and finally through a gate on to the high  road.    \"I know where we are now!\" exclaimed Beatrice gleefully. \"It's only  quite a short way to the Morton's. They live in the next terrace but  two. I believe we're within measurable distance of some lunch.\"    This was such good news that they strode along in renewed spirits.  Considering all, they thought the adventure was turning out well. A meal  would undoubtedly be most acceptable, if Beatrice's friends were  hospitable enough to offer it.    \"It's the fourth house,\" said Beatrice, \"the one with the copper beech  over the gate. Linden Lea--yes, here we are! Oh, I say, what are all the  blinds down for?\"    The girls faced each other blankly.    \"Is anyone dead?\" faltered Ingred.    \"I'll ring and inquire, at any rate,\" murmured Beatrice.    So she rang, and rang again and yet again. She could hear the bell  clanging quite plainly and unmistakably somewhere in the back regions,  yet nobody came to the door.    \"It's funny! I don't hear anybody in the house either,\" she remarked.  \"Their dog generally barks at the least sound.\"    At that moment a small face peeped over the top of the wall which  divided the garden from that of the next house, and a childish voice  asked:    \"Do you want the Mortons?\"    \"Yes. Isn't anybody in?\"    \"They're all gone away to Llandudno, for a month.\"    \"All? Isn't anyone here?\"    \"No, the house is locked up.\"    Here a warning call of \"Willie!\" caused their informant to disappear as  suddenly as he had come, but the girls had heard enough. All their hopes  were suddenly blighted. They had arrived at the end of their journey  only to draw a blank. They were indeed in a worse position than when  they had missed the train at Denscourt, for they were farther from home,  and it was much later. Almost ready to cry, they turned down the garden  again.    \"We've got to get home to-night somehow!\" said Ingred through her set  teeth.    \"Shall we go to the police station?\" quavered Verity.    \"And give ourselves up like lost children? No, it's too undignified!  Wait a moment, I've got an idea!\" said Beatrice. \"We passed the post  office just now, and I noticed it had a 'Public Telephone.' I'll ring up  Mother and tell her where we are, and ask her to come over for us.\"    \"But you can't telephone for nothing, and we haven't so much as a  solitary penny amongst us!\"    \"I know. I thought I'd explain that to the people at the post office,  and ask them to let me have the call, and Mother will pay when she  comes. I could give them my watch as a security.\"    \"It's worth trying!\"    So, with just a little grain of hope, they retraced their steps to the  post office, which was also a stationer's and newsagent's. Nobody was in  the shop, but when the girls thumped on the counter a rosy-cheeked young  person appeared from the back regions.    \"Want to telephone without paying? It's against the post office rules,\"  she snapped, as Beatrice briefly explained the circumstances.    \"My mother will pay when she comes, and if you'd take my watch----\"    \"I can't go against post office rules! All calls must be paid for  beforehand. That's our instructions.\"    \"But just for once----\"    \"What's the matter, Doris?\" asked a voice, and a kindly-looking little  man emerged from the back parlor, wiping his mouth hastily, and took his  place behind the counter. Beatrice turned to him with eagerness, and  again stated the urgency of their peculiar situation.    \"Well, of course we've our instructions from the post office, and we've  got to account for the calls, but in this particular case we might let  you have one, and pay afterwards,\" he replied. \"Oh, never mind the  watch; it's all right!\"    Beatrice lost no time in ringing up Number 167 Grovebury, and to her  immense delight, when she got the connection, she heard her mother's  voice at the instrument. A short explanation was all that was necessary.    \"Stay where you are at the Waverley post office, and I will get a taxi  and fetch you myself immediately,\" returned Mrs. Jackson. \"It's the  greatest relief to know what has become of you. I was going to ring up  the police station, and describe you as 'missing!'\"    The girls had to wait nearly three-quarters of an hour before the taxi  made its appearance, and the welcome form of Mrs. Jackson stepped out of  it. She paid what was owing for the call, thanked the postmaster for his  civility, and hustled the girls into the conveyance as quickly as  possible.    \"I suppose girls will be girls,\" she said, \"but I think you've been very  silly ones to-day! Why didn't you keep with the rest of the school, as  you ought to have done?\"    \"It sounds a most horrible greedy confession,\" replied Beatrice  guiltily, \"but I'm afraid it was all the fault of--buns! They just threw  us late, and we missed the others. We'll never buy buns again! Never!  Never! _O peccavi!_ We have sinned!\"    And she looked so humorously contrite that Mrs. Jackson, who was  inclined to scold, laughed in spite of herself, and forgave the  delinquents.    \"On condition that such a thing doesn't happen again!\" she declared.    \"Trust us! We wouldn't go through such an experience again for all the  buns in the world! Next time we'll cling to the College apron strings  like--like----\"    \"Like adhesive sticking-plaster!\" supplied Ingred gently.    \"Or oysters to a mermaid's tail!\" murmured Verity.          CHAPTER IX    A Hostel Frolic      \"The Foursome League,\" which Verity had instituted with her room-mates  at the hostel, was kept by them as a solemn compact. They stuck to one  another nobly, though often in the teeth of great inconvenience. It  generally took three of them to urge Fil through her toilet in the  mornings and drag her down to breakfast in time. She was always so  terribly sleepy at seven o'clock, and so positive that she could whisk  through her dressing in ten minutes, and that it was quite unnecessary  to get up so soon: even when the others mercilessly pulled the  bed-clothes from her, and pointed to their watches, she would dawdle  instead of \"whisking,\" and spend much superfluous time over manicure or  dabbing on cucumber cream to improve her complexion. She was so innocent  about her little vanities, and conducted them with such child-like  complacency, that the girls tolerated them quite good humoredly, and  even assisted sometimes. One of them generally volunteered to brush her  long flaxen hair, and tie her ribbon, and half out of habit the others  would tidy her cubicle, which was apt to be chaotic, and put her things  away in her drawers. They did it almost automatically, for they had come  to look upon Fil somewhat in the light of a big doll, the exclusive  property of \"The Foursome League,\" and to be treated as the mascot of  the dormitory.    Mrs. Best, the hostel matron, was what the girls called \"rather an old  dear.\" Her gray hair was picturesque, and the knowledge that she had  lost her husband and a son in the war added an element of pathetic  interest to her personality. She was experienced in the ways of girls,  and contrived to keep order without seeming to be constantly obtruding  rules. Among her various sane practices she instituted the plan of  awarding marks for good conduct and order to each dormitory, and  allowing the one which scored the highest to give an entertainment to  the others during the last hour before bedtime on Thursday night.  Naturally this was a privilege to be desired. It"]]]
