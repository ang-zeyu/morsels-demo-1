They could, however, see  the track made by the hippo when he had broken through into the  water, and Mr. Hume, stepping ashore, went up this track to spy  around. He returned with the report that the natives were signaling  from village to village by columns of smoke sent up from fires fed  with damp wood to make a heavy smoke.    \"They will be keeping a sharp look-out, and we had better remain  here.\"    \"It seems to me,\" said Compton, \"that we have been here already a  week.\"    \"Quite that,\" said Venning.    \"The time has seemed long because you have been receiving new  impressions.\"    \"I thought it was a fish I received,\" murmured Compton.    \"Each impression,\" continued the hunter, \"is a sort of milestone in  your memory, so that an hour crowded with several of these  milestones will appear to be longer than a whole blank day. You will  get used to such interrupted nights--that is, if our journey does  not end here.\"    \"Oh, come, sir, we have dodged them beautifully.\"    \"The feeling of security is the beginning of disaster,\" said Mr.  Hume, oracularly. \"The rule of the bush is to keep your eyes  skinned.\"    \"What is the order of the day, then?\"    \"The order of the day is to watch and wait. Venning will crawl on to  the little island on our right and watch the south hank. You,  Compton, will take the head of the large island on our left, and I  will watch from the other end. If any of us see danger, we will give  the whistle of the sand-piper. Each will take water and food, and  each, of course, will keep himself hid.\"    \"We take our guns, of course?\"    \"Best not. A gunshot would bring a host down upon us. Don't be  discouraged,\" continued the hunter, as he saw the boys' faces drop.  \"We have got the advantage of position, and we've got grit--eh?\"    He nodded cheerfully, and they smiled back, and then each crept out  to his allotted post. The first part of the watch was by no means  bad--so the boys decided when they had settled down, Venning under a  bush palm and Compton behind a log. There was a pleasant freshness  in the air; and as the broad river uncoiled under the mist, it  disclosed fresh beauties, till the lifting veil revealed the wooded  heights and the tall columns of smoke, grey against the dark of the  woods and black against the indigo blue of the sky. They marked  where the hippos stood with their bulky heads to the sun, and saw  the crocodiles on the sands of other islands lying motionless with  distended jaws. And then the birds came to the hunting. Strings of  dark ibis, of duck, and storks; small kingfishers all bejeweled, and  greater kingfishers in black and white. The air was full of bird-  calls, of the musical ripple of waters, of the hum of the forest  moved by the morning wind.    By-and-by, however, the sun got to work in earnest, and the pleasure  went out of the watching as the air grew hot and steamy. The sand-  flies and the mosquitoes found them out, and blessed the day that  brought two tender white boys into their very midst. They gathered  to the feast in clouds, but these boys were not there for the fun of  the thing. They drew gossamer veils over the brims of their felt  hats, and gathered them in about their necks. They pulled their soft  high boots up to their knees and secured them there; and, moreover,  they smeared an abomination of grease and eucalyptus oil over their  hands. The mosquitoes set up a shrill trumpeting that could be heard  ten paces away, and held a mass meeting to protest; whereupon the  father of all the dragon-flies, a magnificent warrior in a steel-  blue armour, saw that a conspiracy was afoot, and swept into the  midst with a whirr and a snap, a turn here and a flash there, that  scattered the host in a twinkling of a gnat's eye.    The islands shimmered in the glare as if they were afloat; the  hippos took to the water, and a deep and drowsy silence fell upon  the great river. But man, ever restless, was astir, and through the  stillness there was borne to the three a soft continuous humming,  that merged quietly into the short, clamorous throbs of an engine at  work under pressure.    The launch was afloat again! Mr. Hume caught the trail of the smoke  first, and Compton next. They marked the course under the north bank  right up to a bend about six miles off, and they judged that the  launch had stopped there, as the smoke went up in a straight thin  column. Then Venning saw a canoe dart out from the south bank,  followed by two others from different points. The sun struck like  fire on gun-barrel and spear-head, and gleamed on the wet paddles.  He moistened his parched lips with a taste of water from his filter-  bottle, and gave the call. The answer came, and he drew his friends  to him with a low whistling. As they came crouching, he pointed  upriver.    \"Three canoes put out. Two are hidden behind that outside island,  and there is the other creeping round the end.\"    \"Oh ay,\" said Mr. Hume. \"If they're after us, they will have placed  outlooks in the tallest trees;\" and with his glass he swept the  forest.    \"They could not see us at that distance.\"    \"But they could see our boat as soon as we appeared in open water.  We'll stay where we are.\"    \"Then we shall need our guns.\"    \"It is not our guns that will save us, my lad, but strategy. Any one  could fire off a rifle, but it takes nerve to keep cool in readiness  to do the right thing at the right time.\"    \"But,\" said Compton, obstinately, \"we don't want to be caught  undefended.\"    \"Leave this matter with me,\" said the hunter, sternly. \"See that  crocodile asleep on that stretch of sand? He's our best protector.  Why? Because he is asleep. The natives, seeing him, would think we  were not near. We will, however, keep watch together.\"    They returned to the boat, made all ready for an instant departure,  in case they were discovered, then settled down to wait and watch  once more. Gradually the strain wore off, the old silence fell upon  the scene, and their eyes grew heavy from sheer monotony. The night  had seemed long, bat the day was worse.    Then the boys rubbed their eyes and lifted their heads. Where there  had been a bare stretch of water white under the sun between two  islands a quarter of a mile off, there appeared a long canoe, with a  tall spearman standing in the bows, and a full crew behind.    The man in the bows looked straight down the channel to their lair,  where in the narrow cut the Okapi lay hidden behind a screen of  leaves. Then he moved his hand to the right, and the canoe,  silently, without a ripple almost, skirted the island on that side,  into whose reedy sides the men darted their glances. Again the hand  was moved, and the long boat crept across to the island on the left,  which was swept by the sharp suspicious eyes of the natives. Again  the bowman directed his gaze into the narrow opening, and this time  he looked long. There was one small island to pass, and if the canoe  kept on the north side, it would have to come right into the hiding-  place; if it kept to the south, it would reappear at the end of the  passage by which the Okapi had entered.    In either case, the danger of discovery seemed certain. The three  pairs of eyes from behind the tall grass were glued to the man's  face. They saw him start, then move his hand to the left, and as the  canoe went stealthily out of their view round the south side, they  heard the sullen plunge made by a crocodile as, disturbed from his  sleep, he took to the waters.    Then the three crept back to the boat. \"Pull her through the  screen,\" whispered the hunter, as he caught up his rifle, \"but make  no noise;\" and he took up another position ashore, this time facing  the other end of the channel.    With great caution the boys coaxed the Okapi through the trailing  branches, so that she would be hidden from view if the natives  looked up the channel. Then they waited and waited for ages before  the hunter showed himself.    \"Well?\" they asked in a whisper.    \"They have passed on.\"    \"And?\" they said, watching his face.    \"I don't quite like it. They may have no suspicions, but I think  they have; for one man pointed up in this direction.\"    \"If they suspected anything they would have stopped surely.\"    \"Perhaps not. The native doesn't like the look of a trap, and it  maybe that they passed on with the intention of returning at night.  Or they may have gone for the other boats.\" Mr. Hume stood up to  glance shorewards.    \"Would it not be better to move on?\" said Venning.    \"If we could be sure that we should not be seen from the land, that  would be the move.\" He stroked his beard. \"I guess we'll move,\" he  said, \"just about dusk, for I'm pretty sure in my mind that they did  take particular notice of this channel, and my policy is always to  listen to your instincts.\"    \"Instincts,\" muttered Compton; \"call them nerves.\"    Mr. Hume laughed. \"About the time you were born, Dick, I was playing  a lone hand in Lo-Ben's country as trader and hunter, when a loss of  nerve would have meant loss of life. See! So just leave this to me,  and shove her along.\"    Compton grinned back at the hunter, and tugged at his oar, for the  levers clanked too loud for this work. They crept along to another  berth a little way off, and tied up in the shadow of the bank; and  they had scarcely settled themselves when they heard again the beat  of engines. The launch was returning, and was returning in answer to  a signal that the game had been found! A pungent smell of smoke  suddenly reached them, and, standing up, they saw over the reeds  that a fire had been made on one of the neighbouring islands.    That was the signal!    Glancing shorewards they saw that more canoes were putting off--dark  smudges on the water, but growing clearer as the crews dashed the  paddles. But there were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],[0,"The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#14)"],[1,"were going and then grew  cloudy.    \"Looks like rain or snow to me,\" announced Jack.    \"Oh, don't croak!\" cried Andy. \"It's a bit cloudy, but that's all. I  guess it will hold off until morning.\"    \"Got your bicycle ready for the trip, Andy?\" questioned Pepper.    \"Sure, I oiled up this morning. How about you?\"    \"Ready since yesterday, and Jack's wheel is ready, too,\" was the answer.  \"Oh, say, don't you anticipate a dandy time at Point View Lodge?\"    \"Yes, indeed! The Ford girls are just all right.\"    \"Best ever!\" chimed in Jack.    \"Don't forget to fill your lamps!\" cried Andy, as he turned away.    \"Mine is full,\" answered Jack.    \"I'll see to mine,\" came from Pepper. \"Glad you mentioned it. It will be  quite dark on the road to-night, and I don't want to run in a hole and  take a header.\"    \"None of us want to do that. We'd look fine going into the Lodge with  our faces and hands all dirt and our uniforms torn.\"    The cadets hurried away in various directions. They had been talking in  the gymnasium, near one of the dressing-rooms, and they did not know  that anybody else was near. But Mumps, the sneak, had overheard every  word. As soon as they had gone, the younger cadet hurried off toward the  boathouse. Here he found half a dozen students assembled, including  Ritter and Coulter.    \"Say, do you fellows know that Ruddy, Ditmore and Snow are going out  to-night?\" he said. He always loved to tell the news, and thought  himself quite important in so doing.    \"Where to?\" asked one of the cadets.    \"To Point View Lodge--the place where the Ford family live. They've got  an invitation to dinner.\"    \"Lucky dogs!\" came from another cadet. As he spoke he looked at Reff  Ritter, but that individual merely scowled, and took surreptitious  whiffs at a cigarette he was smoking.    \"How are they going to Point View?\" asked another who was present.    \"Going on their bicycles,\" answered Mumps. \"It's quite a ride, isn't  it?\"    \"Oh, not for them. They can make it in half an hour if they try. But  they'll find it pretty dark to-night, I'm thinking,\" added the cadet,  with a glance out of the boathouse window at the leaden sky.    The talk continued and Ritter listened closely to every word. Then he  arose and motioned to Coulter, and the two walked outside.    \"Did you hear what Mumps said?\" he asked of his crony.    \"About those chaps going to the Fords' home?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What of it?\"    \"I was thinking we might spoil their fun.\"    \"And get caught, as we did with the tar-barrels,\" grumbled Gus Coulter.    \"We'll take good care that nobody sees us this time.\"    \"What are you thinking of doing?\" asked Coulter, curiously.    \"Come with me and I'll tell you,\" answered Reff Ritter, and took his  crony by the arm. Slowly they walked across the campus, and as they did  so Ritter unfolded a plot that had just then come into his head.    \"What do you think of it?\" he asked, after he had finished.    \"Very good; if it will work, and we are not caught.\"    \"We'll not get caught if you'll do as I say. Listen, Gus, all you need  to do is to stand on guard, to give me warning if anybody comes. I'll do  the rest.\"    \"When do you want to get to work?\"    Reff Ritter looked around anxiously. It was cold on the campus and  growing darker rapidly. Only a few cadets were in sight.    \"Come on now,\" he answered. \"We'll see if the coast is clear.\"    They walked to the end of the gymnasium building, where, in a long room,  the bicycles of the students were kept. It was pitch dark inside and not  a soul was in sight.    \"Now, you remain outside,\" said Ritter. \"If you see anybody coming begin  to whistle 'Yankee Doodle,' as loud as you can. Don't wait for me, for  I'll go out the back way.\"    \"All right. But let me know when you are through,\" answered Coulter,  somewhat nervously.    \"Sure.\"    Coulter took his stand outside of the building and peered forth eagerly  in the darkness. Only three cadets were in view and they presently  entered the school building. Then ten minutes went by--a long wait for  the youth who was aiding Ritter in his plot. Then Reff came quickly from  the gymnasium.    \"Anybody around?\" he asked hurriedly.    \"No.\"    \"Good enough.\"    \"Have you finished, Reff?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Did you get at all three of the wheels?\"    \"I sure did. Say, they will have their own troubles, see if they don't!\"  chuckled the bully. \"But come on before anybody sees us,\" he added, and  stalked away in the darkness, with his crony beside him.          CHAPTER XIII    THE WORK OF THE ENEMY      It was not until a few minutes after five o'clock that Jack, Andy and  Pepper hurried down to the gymnasium, to get their wheels. At the last  moment Andy discovered that one of his buttons was loose and had to be  sewed on, and Jack had trouble with the new cap he was going to wear. It  was a trifle too large and he had to place a strip of paper under the  band to make it stay on his head properly.    \"It certainly feels like snow,\" said Pepper, as the three got out their  bicycles. \"I am sure we'll get a snowstorm before long.\"    \"I don't care, if only it holds off till we get back,\" returned Andy.    They lit the acetylene gas lamps, with which their wheels were provided,  and then ran the bicycles down to the roadway.    \"Have a good time,\" cried Stuffer, who had come out to see them off.    \"Don't worry about that,\" replied Pepper, gaily.    \"I'll wager you'll have a dandy spread,\" went on the lad who loved to  eat.    \"Wish you were along, Stuffer?\" asked Jack.    \"Do I? Well, now, don't mention it!\" and Stuffer's eyes fairly watered  in anticipation.    \"I'll bring you something if I get the chance,\" sang out Pepper, as he  gave his bicycle a shove and leaped into the saddle. \"So-long!\"    Jack and Andy followed their chum, and with a parting cry to Stuffer,  all three pedaled along the highway leading to Point View Lodge. It was  now night, but the three gas-lamps lit up the road so well that they had  little difficulty in finding their way.    \"We are not due until six o'clock,\" said Jack. \"So we can take it easy.  No use of getting into a perspiration over it.\"    \"We'll not sweat much to-night,\" answered Pepper. \"Too cold. I move we  keep at it until we reach that old barn near the Lodge. Then we can rest  a bit, so that we won't appear at the place all out of breath.\"    Two miles were covered, and then they came to a place where the highway  was unusually rough.    \"Let me go ahead and pick the way,\" sang out Andy, and forged to the  front.    \"Better slack up a little!\" returned the young major. \"No use of taking  chances when we have plenty of time.\"    Scarcely had he uttered the words when there came a cry from the  acrobatic youth. His wheel commenced to wobble and twist. Over into some  bushes he shot, to fall with a crash in their midst.    \"Hello, what's the matter with you?\" sang out Pepper, and leaped quickly  to the road, an example followed by Jack.    \"Bicycle has gone to pieces, I guess,\" spluttered Andy, as he essayed to  scramble out of the bushes.    \"Are you hurt?\" demanded Jack, anxiously.    \"Only a few scratches, Jack. Say, that was a narrow escape, wasn't it?\"    \"Thought you said your wheel was in good condition,\" came from Pepper.    \"So it was when I looked at it this morning.\"    \"What's wrong now?\"    \"The handle-bars are loose for one thing. I don't know what else is  wrong until I look it over.\"    The machine was brought forth from the bushes. The lamp-glass had been  smashed and the light had gone out. Andy stopped the flow of acetylene  gas, and then his chums turned the rays of the other lamps on the  disabled bicycle.    \"Handle-bars loose and also nuts on the front wheel!\" cried Andy, after  an examination. \"Say, I believe some enemy did this!\"    \"Who?\" questioned the young major.    \"I don't know. Maybe Ritter, or Coulter.\"    \"Hurry up and tighten things,\" cried Pepper. \"We don't want to be late.\"    \"Better be late than have a nasty tumble,\" returned Jack. \"While you are  at it, Andy, better look the whole machine over carefully.\"    \"I will, Jack. And maybe you had better look your machines over, too.\"    \"Good advice.\"    While Andy was fixing his bicycle Pepper and the young major inspected  their own bicycles.    \"Well, I never!\" gasped The Imp, as the light fell on his rear wheel.  \"Another quarter of a mile and I would have had a spill and no mistake!\"    \"Same here!\" came from Jack. \"Oh, isn't this the worst yet!\"    \"What's wrong?\" queried the acrobatic youth.    \"The back wheel is loose, and two of the sprockets of the sprocket-wheel  have been filed down, to let the chain slip,\" answered Pepper.    \"And my handle-bars are loose and the chain all but filed in two,\" cried  Jack. \"Boys, this was done on purpose!\"    \"Of course!\" came from both of the others.    \"Done by our enemies!\"    \"Sure.\"    \"Ritter and his cronies.\"    \"Well, we'd have to prove that,\" answered Andy, slowly.    \"Don't you believe it, Andy?\"    \"I do; but that isn't proof.\"    \"And that isn't getting us to Point View Lodge,\" came from Pepper. \"I  guess we'll have to walk!\" he added, with something like a groan.    \"Walk! We can't walk that distance,\" replied the young major.    \"Well, we can't trust ourselves on these machines. We might if we had  lots of time, but that we haven't got.\"    The three cadets stared blankly at each other. Here they were on a  lonely road, and what to do none of them knew.    \"Oh, if I only had Ritter here wouldn't I punch his head good!\" muttered  Pepper.    \"Ritter will keep. Let us look over the machines and make up our minds  what is to be done,\" said Jack.    The more they inspected the wheels the more hopeless appeared the task  of fixing them up so they could be used.    \"We simply haven't got time to bother with them,\" announced Jack. \"We've  got to get to the Lodge some other way.\"    \"Well, what way?\" asked Andy.    \"I wonder if we could hire a rig at the"]]]
