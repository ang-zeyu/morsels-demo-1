In the Boer army the generals and commandants were of much  less importance, for the reason that the Boer burgher acted almost always  on his own initiative. The generals were of more service before the  beginning of a battle than while it was in progress. When a burgher became  aware of the presence of the enemy his natural instincts, his innate  military system, told him the best manner in which to attack his adversary  as well as his general could have informed him. The generals and other  officers were of prime importance in leading the burghers to the point  where the enemy was likely to be found, but when that point was reached  their period of usefulness ended, for the burghers knew how to wage the  battle as well as they did. Generally speaking, the most striking  difference between the Boer army and a trained army was the difference in  the distribution of intelligence.    All the intelligence of a trained army is centred in the officers; in the  Boer army there was much practical military sense and alertness of mind  distributed throughout the entire force.    Mr. Disraeli once said: \"Doubtless to think with vigour, with clearness,  and with depth in the recess of a cabinet is a fine intellectual  demonstration; but to think with equal vigour, clearness, and depth among  bullets, appears the loftiest exercise and the most complete triumph of  the human faculties.\" Without attempting to insinuate that every Boer  burgher was a man of the high mental attainments referred to by the  eminent British statesman, it must be acknowledged that the fighting Boer  was a man of more than ordinary calibre.    In battle the Boer burgher was practically his own general. He had an eye  which quickly grasped a situation, and he never waited for an order from  an officer to take advantage of it. When he saw that he could with safety  approach the enemy more closely he did so on his own responsibility, and  when it became evident to him that it would be advantageous to occupy a  different position in order that he might stem the advance of the enemy he  acted entirely on his own initiative. He remained in one position just as  long as he considered it safe to do so, and if conditions warranted he  went forward, and if they were adverse he retreated, whether there was an  order from an officer or not. When he saw that the burghers in another  part of the field were hard pressed by the enemy he deserted his own  position and went to their assistance, and when his own position became  untenable, in his own opinion, he simply vacated it and went to another  spot where bullets and shells were less thick. If he saw a number of the  enemy who were detached from the main body of their own force, and he  believed that they could be taken prisoner, he enlisted a number of the  burghers who were near him, and made an effort to capture them, whether  there was an officer close at hand or a mile distant.    No one was surfeited with orders; in fact, the lack of them was more  noticeable, and it was well that it was so, for the Boer burgher disliked  to be ordered, and he always did things with better grace when he acted  spontaneously. An illustration of this fact was an incident at the fight  of Modderspruit where two young Boers saved an entire commando from  falling into the hands of the enemy. Lieutenant Oelfse, of the State  Artillery, and Reginald Sheppard, of the Pretoria commando, observed a  strong force of the British advancing towards a kopje where the  Krugersdorp commando was concealed. The two men saw that the  Krugersdorpers would be cut off in a short time if they were not informed  of the British advance, so they determined to plunge across the open veld,  six hundred yards from the enemy's guns, and tell them of their danger. No  officer could have compelled the men to undertake such a hazardous journey  across a bullet-swept plain, but Oelfse and Sheppard acted on their own  responsibility, succeeded in reaching the Krugersdorp commando without  being hit, and gave to the commandant the information which undoubtedly  saved him and his men from being captured. Incidents of like nature  occurred in almost every battle of the campaign, and occasionally the  service rendered so voluntarily by the burghers was of momentous  consequences, even if the act itself seemed trivial at the time.    A second feature of the Boer army, and equally as important as the freedom  of action of its individuals, was its mobility. Every burgher was mounted  on a fleet horse or pony, and consequently his movements on the  battlefield, whether in an advance or in a retreat, were many times more  rapid that those of his enemy--an advantage which was of inestimable value  both during an engagement and in the intervals between battles when it was  necessary to secure new positions. During the progress of a battle the  Boers were able to desert a certain point for a time, mount their horses  and ride to another position, and throw their full strength against the  latter, yet remaining in such close touch with the former that it was  possible to return and defend it in an exceedingly short space of time.  With the aid of their horses they could make such a sudden rush from one  position to another that the infantry of the enemy could be surrounded and  cut off from all communications with the body of its army almost before it  was known that any Boers were in the vicinity, and it was due to that fact  that the Boers were able to make so many large numbers of captives.    The fighting along the Tugela furnished many magnificent examples of the  Boers' extreme mobility. There it was a constant jump from one position to  another--one attack here yesterday, another there to-day. It was an  incessant movement made necessary by the display of energy by the British,  whose thrice-larger forces kept the Boers in a state of continued  ferment. On one side of the river, stretched out from the south of Spion  Kop, in the west, to almost Helpmakaar, in the east, were thirty thousand  British troops watching for a weak point where they might cross, and  attacking whenever there seemed to be the slightest opportunity of  breaking through; on the other side were between two and three thousand  mounted Boers, jumping from one point to another in the long line of  territory to be guarded, and repelling the attacks whenever they were  made. The country was in their favour, it is true, but it was not so  favourable that a handful of men could defend it against thousands, and it  was partly due to the great ease and rapidity with which the Boers could  move from one place to another, that Ladysmith remained besieged so long.  The mobility of the Boers was again well demonstrated by the retreat of  the burghers from the environs of Ladysmith. After the Krijgsraad decided  to withdraw the forces into the Biggarsberg, it required only a few hours  for all the many commandos to leave the positions they had held so long;  to load their impedimenta and to be well on the way to the northward. The  departure was so rapid that it surprised even those who were in  Ladysmith. One day the Boers were shelling the town as usual and all the  commandos were observed in the same positions which they had occupied for  several months; the following day not a single Boer was to be seen  anywhere. They had quietly mounted their horses by night and before the  sun rose in the morning they were trekking north beyond Modderspruit and  Elandslaagte, on the way to Glencoe. General Cronje's flight from  Magersfontein was also accomplished with great haste and in good order,  but what probably was the finest example of the Boers' mobility was the  magnificent retreat along the Basuto border of Generals Grobler, Olivier,  and Lemmer, with their six thousand men, when the enemy was known to be in  great strength within several days' march of them. After the capture of  Cronje at Paardeberg the three generals, who had been conducting the  campaign in the eastern provinces of Cape Colony, were in a most dangerous  position, having the enemy in the rear, the left and left front, the  neutral Basuto land on the right front, and only a small strip of  territory along the western border of the Basuto country apparently free  of the enemy. The British were in Bloemfontein and in the surrounding  country, and it seemed almost impossible that the six thousand men could  ever extricate themselves from such a position to join the Boer forces in  the north. It would have been a comparatively easy matter for six thousand  mounted men to make the journey if they had not been loaded down with  impedimenta, but the three generals were obliged to carry with them all  their huge transport waggons and heavy camping paraphernalia. The trek  northward was begun near Colesburg on March 12th, and when all the  different commandos had joined the main column the six thousand horsemen,  the seven hundred and fifty transport-waggons, the two thousand natives,  and twelve thousand cattle formed a line extending more than twenty-four  miles. The scouts, who were despatched westward from the column to  ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy, reported large forces of British  cavalry sixty and seventy miles distant, but for some inexplicable reason  the British made no attempt to cut off the retreat of the three generals,  and on March 28th they reached Kroonstad, having traversed almost four  hundred miles of territory in the comparatively short time of sixteen  days. Sherman's march to the sea was made under extraordinary conditions,  but the retreat of the three generals was fraught with dangers and  difficulties much greater. Sherman passed through a fertile country, and  had an enemy which was disheartened.

Well, he may have been so later on, but  it was not, I think, the last phase of his evolution. His actions speak  for themselves. On 14 June, 1848, in a famous speech to the National  Democratic Association, Wagner violently attacked the organisation of  society itself, and demanded both the abolition of money and the  extinction of what was left of the aristocracy. In _Das Kunstwerk der  Zukunft_ (1849) he showed that beyond the \"local nationalism\" were signs  of a \"supernational universalism.\" And all this was not merely talk, for  he risked his life for his ideas. Herr Chamberlain himself quotes the  account of a witness who saw him, in May, 1849, distributing  revolutionary pamphlets to the troops who were besieging Dresden. It was  a miracle that he was not arrested and shot. We know that after Dresden  was taken a warrant was out against him, and he fled to Switzerland,  with a passport on which was a borrowed name. If it be true that Wagner  later declared that he had been \"involved in error and led away by his  feelings\" it matters little to the history of that time. Errors and  enthusiasms are an integral part of life, and one must not ignore them  in a man's biography under the pretext that he regretted them twenty or  thirty years later, for they have, nevertheless, helped to guide his  actions and impressed his imagination. It was out of the Revolution  itself that _Siegfried_ directly sprang.    In 1848, Wagner was not yet thinking of a Tetralogy, but of an heroic  opera in three acts called _Siegfried's Tod_, in which the fatal power  of gold was to be symbolised in the treasure of the Niebelungen; and  Siegfried was to represent \"a socialist redeemer come down to earth to  abolish the reign of Capital.\" As the rough draft developed, Wagner went  up the stream of his hero's life. He dreamed of his childhood, of his  conquest of the treasure, of the awakening of Bruennhilde; and in 1851 he  wrote the poem of _Der Junge Siegfried_. Siegfried and Bruennhilde  represent the humanity of the future, the new era that should be  realised when the earth was set free from the yoke of gold. Then Wagner  went farther back still, to the sources of the legend itself, and Wotan  appeared, the symbol of our time, a man such as you or I--in contrast to  Siegfried, man as he ought to be, and one day will be. On this subject  Wagner says, in a letter to Roeckel: \"Look well at Wotan; he is the  unmistakable likeness of ourselves, and the sum of the present-day  spirit, while Siegfried is the man we wait and wish for--the future man  whom we cannot create, but who will create himself by our  annihilation--the most perfect man I can imagine.\" Finally Wagner  conceived the Twilight of the Gods, the fall of the Valhalla--our  present system of society--and the birth of a regenerated humanity.  Wagner wrote to Uhlig in 1851 that the complete work was to be played  after the great Revolution.    The opera public would probably be very astonished to learn that in  _Siegfried_ they applaud a revolutionary work, expressly directed by  Wagner against this detested Capital, whose downfall would have been so  dear to him. And he never doubted that he was expressing grief in all  these pages of shining joy.    Wagner went to Zurich after a stay in Paris, where he felt \"so much  distrust for the artistic world and horror for the restraint that he was  forced to put upon himself\" that he was seized with a nervous malady  which nearly killed him. He returned to work at _Der Junge Siegfried_,  and he says it brought him great joy.         \"But I am unhappy in not being able to apply myself to anything but       music. I know I am feeding on an illusion, and that reality is the       only thing worth having. My health is not good, and my nerves are       in a state of increasing weakness. My life, lived entirely in the       imagination and without sufficient action, tires me so, that I can       only work with frequent breaks and long intervals of rest;       otherwise I pay the penalty with long and painful suffering.... I       am very lonely. I often wish for death.         \"While I work I forget my troubles; but the moment I rest they come       flocking about me, and I am very miserable. What a splendid life is       an artist's! Look at it! How willingly would I part with it for a       week of real life.         \"I can't understand how a really happy man could think of serving       art. If we enjoyed life, we should have no need of art. When the       present has nothing more to offer us we cry out our needs by means       of art. To have my youth again and my health, to enjoy nature, to       have a wife who would love me devotedly, and fine children--for       this I would give up _all my art_. Now I have said it--give me what       is left.\"    Thus the poem of the Tetralogy was written with doubts, as he said, as  to whether he should abandon art and all belonging to it and become a  healthy, normal man--a son of nature. He began to compose the music of  the poem while in a state of suffering, which every day became more  acute.         \"My nights are often sleepless; I get out of bed, wretched and       exhausted, with the thought of a long day before me, which will not       bring me a single joy. The society of others tortures me, and I       avoid it only to torture myself. Everything I do fills me with       disgust. It can't go on for ever. I can't stand such a life any       longer. I will kill myself rather than live like this.... I don't       believe in anything, and I have only one desire--to sleep so       soundly that human misery will exist no more for me. I ought to be       able to get such a sleep somehow; it should not be really       difficult.\"    For distraction he went to Italy; Turin, Genoa, Spezia, and Nice. But  there, in a strange world, his loneliness seemed so frightful that he  became very depressed, and made all haste back to Zurich. It was there  he wrote the happy music of _Das Rheingold_. He began the score of _Die  Walkuere_ at a time when his normal condition was one of suffering. Then  he discovered Schopenhauer, whose philosophy only helped to confirm and  crystallise his instinctive pessimism. In the spring of 1855 he went to  London to give concerts; but he was ill there, and this fresh contact  with the world only served to annoy him further. He had some difficulty  in again taking up _Die Walkuere_; but he finished it at last in spite of  frequent attacks of facial erysipelas, for which he afterwards had to  undergo a hydropathic cure at Geneva. He began the score of _Siegfried_  towards the end of 1856, while the thought of Tristan was stirring  within him. In _Tristan_ he wished to depict love as \"a dreadful  anguish\"; and this idea obsessed him so completely that he could not  finish _Siegfried_. He seemed to be consumed by a burning fever; and,  abandoning _Siegfried_ in the middle of the second act, he threw himself  madly into _Tristan_. \"I want to gratify my desire for love,\" he says,  \"until it is completely satiated; and in the folds of the black flag  that floats over its consummation I wish to wrap myself and die.\"[109]  _Siegfried_ was not finished until 5 February, 1871, at the end of the  Franco-Prussian war--that is fourteen years later, after several  interruptions.    Such is, in a few words, the history of this heroic idyll. It is perhaps  as well to remind the public now and then that the hours of distraction  they enjoy by means of art may represent years of suffering for the  artist.           *       *       *       *       *    [Footnote 109: The quotations from Wagner are taken from his letters to  Roeckel, Uhlig, and Liszt, between 1851 and 1856.]    Do you know the amusing account Tolstoy gave of a performance of  _Siegfried_? I will quote it from his book, _What is Art_?--         \"When I arrived, an actor in tight-fitting breeches was seated       before an object that was meant to represent an anvil. He wore a       wig and false beard; his white and manicured hands had nothing of       the workman about them; and his easy air, prominent belly, and       flabby muscles readily betrayed the actor. With an absurd hammer he       struck--as no one else would ever strike--a fantastic-looking       sword-blade. One guessed he was a dwarf, because when he walked he       bent his legs at the knees. He cried out a great deal, and opened       his mouth in a queer fashion. The orchestra also emitted peculiar       noises like several beginnings that had nothing to do with one       another. Then another actor appeared with a horn in his belt,       leading a man dressed up as a bear, who walked on all-fours. He let       loose the bear on the dwarf, who ran away, but forgot to bend his       knees this time. The actor with the human face represented the       hero, Siegfried. He cried out for a long time, and the dwarf       replied in the same way. Then a traveller arrived--the god Wotan.       He had a wig, too; and, settling himself down with his spear, in a       silly attitude, he told Mimi all about things he already knew, but       of which the audience was ignorant. Then Siegfried seized some bits       that were supposed to represent pieces of a sword, and sang:         'Heaho, heaho, hoho! Hoho, hoho, hoho, hoho! Hoheo, haho, haheo,       hoho!' And that was the end of the first act. It was all so       artificial and stupid that I had great difficulty in sitting it       out. But my friends begged me to stay, and assured me that the       second act would be better.         \"The next scene represented a forest. Wotan was waking up the       dragon. At first the dragon said, 'I want to go to sleep'; but       eventually he came out of his grotto. The dragon was represented by       two men clothed in a "]]]
