Next to William Penn,[3] the person who did the most for Philadelphia  was a young man who had gone from Boston to make his home among the  Quakers. He lived in a small house near the market. On a board over  the door he had painted his name and business; here it is:    [Illustration: \"BENJAMIN FRANKLIN PRINTER\" BUSINESS SIGN.]    [Footnote 1: See paragraph 104.]    [Footnote 2: See paragraph 99.]    [Footnote 3: See paragraph 96.]      110. Franklin's newspaper and almanac;[4] how he worked; standing  before kings.--Franklin was then publishing a small newspaper,  called the _Pennsylvania Gazette_.[5] To-day we print newspapers by  steam at the rate of two or three hundred a minute; but Franklin,  standing in his shirtsleeves at a little press, printed his with his  own hands. It was hard work, as you could see by the drops of sweat  that stood on his forehead; and it was slow as well as hard. The young  man not only wrote himself most of what he printed in his paper, but  he often made his own ink; sometimes he even made his own type.[6]  When he got out of paper he would take a wheelbarrow, go out and buy  a load, and wheel it home. To-day there are more than three hundred  newspapers printed in Philadelphia; then there were only two, and  Franklin's was the better of those two.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN AT A PRINTING PRESS.]    [Illustration: A TYPE. (The Letter B.)]    [Illustration: FRANKLIN WHEELING A LOAD OF PAPER.]    Besides this paper he published an almanac, which thousands of people  bought. In it he printed such sayings as these: \"_He who would  thrive[7] must rise at five_,\" and \"_If you want a thing well done,  do it yourself._\" But Franklin was not contented with simply printing  these sayings, for he practised them as well.    Sometimes his friends would ask him why he began work so early in  the morning, and kept at it so many hours. He would laugh, and tell  them that his father used to repeat to him this saying of Solomon's:  \"_Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before  kings; he shall not stand before mean men._\"[8]    At that time the young printer never actually expected to stand in  the presence of a king, but years later he met with five; and one  of them, his friend the king of France, gave him his picture set round  with diamonds.    [Footnote 4: Almanac (al'ma-nak).]    [Footnote 5: Gazette (ga-zet'): a newspaper.]    [Footnote 6: Type: the raised metal letters used in printing are made  by melting lead and some other metals together and pouring the  mixture into molds.]    [Footnote 7: Thrive: to get on in business, to prosper.]    [Footnote 8: See Prov. xxii. 29.]      111. Franklin's boyhood; making tallow candles; he is apprenticed[9]  to his brother; how he managed to save money to buy books.--Franklin's  father was a poor man with a large family. He lived in Boston, and made  soap and candles. Benjamin went to school two years; then, when he was  ten years old, his father set him to work in his factory, and he never  went to school again. He was now kept busy filling the candle-molds  with melted grease, cutting off the ends of the wicks, and running  errands. But the boy did not like this kind of work; and, as he was  very fond of books, his father put him in a printing-office. This  office was carried on by James Franklin, one of Benjamin's brothers.  James Franklin paid a small sum of money each week for Benjamin's  board; but the boy told him that if he would let him have half the  money to use as he liked, he would board himself. James was glad to do  this. Benjamin then gave up eating meat, and, while the others went out  to dinner, he would stay in the printing-office and eat a boiled  potato, or perhaps a handful of raisins. In this way, he saved up a  number of coppers every week; and when he got enough laid by, he would  buy a book.    But James Franklin was not only a mean man, but a hot-tempered one;  and when he got angry with his young apprentice,[10] he would beat  and knock him about. At length the lad, who was now seventeen, made  up his mind that he would run away, and go to New York.    [Footnote 9: Apprenticed: bound by a written agreement to learn a  trade of a master, who is bound by the same agreement to teach the  trade.]    [Footnote 10: Apprentice: one who is apprenticed to a master to learn  a trade. See footnote 9.]      112. Young Franklin runs away; he goes to New York, and then to  Philadelphia.--Young Franklin sold some of his books, and with the  money paid his passage to New York by a sailing-vessel--for in those  days there were no steamboats or railroads in America. When he got  to New York, he could not find work, so he decided to go on to  Philadelphia.    He started to walk across New Jersey to Burlington, on the Delaware  River, a distance of about fifty miles; there he hoped to get a  sail-boat going down the river to Philadelphia. Shortly after he set  out, it began to rain hard, and the lad was soon wet to the skin and  splashed all over with red mud; but he kept on until noon, then took  a rest, and on the third day he reached Burlington and got passage  down the river.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN WALKING IN THE RAIN.]      113. Franklin's Sunday walk in Philadelphia; the rolls; Miss Read;  the Quaker meeting-house.--Franklin landed in Philadelphia on  Sunday morning (1723). He was tired and hungry; he had but a single  dollar in the world. As he walked along, he saw a bake-shop open.  He went in and bought three great, puffy rolls for a penny[11] each.  Then he started up Market Street, where he was one day to have his  newspaper office. He had a roll like a small loaf of bread tucked  under each arm, and he was eating the other as though it tasted good  to him. As he passed a house, he noticed a nice-looking young woman  at the door. She seemed to want to laugh; and well she might, for  Franklin appeared like a youthful tramp who had been robbing a  baker's shop. The young woman was Miss Deborah[12] Read. A number  of years later Franklin married her. He always said that he could  not have got a better wife.    [Illustration: Map of Franklin's route from Boston to Philadelphia.]    Franklin kept on in his walk until he came to the Delaware. He took  a hearty drink of river water to settle his breakfast, and then gave  away the two rolls he had under his arm to a poor woman with a child.  On his way back from the river he followed a number of people to a  Quaker meeting-house. At the meeting no one spoke. Franklin was tired  out, and, not having any preacher to keep him awake, he soon fell  asleep, and slept till the meeting was over. He says, \"This was the  first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.\"    [Footnote 11: Penny: an English coin worth two cents.]    [Footnote 12: Deborah (Deb'o-rah).]      114. Franklin finds work; he goes back to Boston on a visit; he learns  to stoop.--The next day the young man found some work in a  printing-office. Six months afterward he decided to go back to Boston  to see his friends. He started on his journey with a good suit of  clothes, a silver watch, and a well-filled purse.    While in Boston, Franklin went to call on a minister who had written  a little book[13] which he had been very fond of reading. As he was  coming away from the minister's house, he had to go through a low  passage-way under a large beam. \"Stoop! Stoop!\" cried out the  gentleman; but Franklin did not understand him, and so hit his head  a sharp knock against the beam. \"Ah,\" said his friend, as he saw him  rubbing his head, \"you are young, and have the world before you;  _stoop_ as you go through it, and you will miss many hard thumps.\"  Franklin says that this sensible advice, which was thus beat into  his head, was of great use afterward; in fact, he learned then how  to stoop to conquer.    [Illustration: FRANKLIN LEARNING TO STOOP.]    [Footnote 13: The name of this book, written by the Rev. Cotton Mather,  was _Essays to do Good_.]      115. Franklin returns to Philadelphia; he goes to London; water  against beer.--Franklin soon went back to Philadelphia. The governor  of Pennsylvania then persuaded him to go to London, telling him that  he would help him to get a printing-press and type to start a  newspaper in Philadelphia.    When Franklin reached London, he found that the governor was one of  those men who promise great things, but do nothing. Instead of buying  a press, he had to go to work in a printing-office to earn his bread.  He stayed in London more than a year. At the office where he worked  the men were great beer-drinkers. One of his companions bought six  pints a day. He began with a pint before breakfast, then took another  pint at breakfast, then a pint between breakfast and dinner, then  a pint at dinner, then a pint in the afternoon, and, last of all,  a pint after he had done work. Franklin drank nothing but water. The  others laughed at him, and nicknamed him the \"Water-American\"; but  after a while they had to confess that he was stronger than they were  who drank so much strong beer.    The fact was that Franklin could beat them both at work and at play.  When they went out for a bath in the Thames,[14] they found that their  \"Water-American\" could swim like a fish; and he so astonished them  that a rich Londoner tried to persuade him to start a swimming-school  to teach his sons, but Franklin had stayed in England long enough,  and he now decided to go back to Philadelphia.    [Footnote 14: Thames (Tems). London is on the river Thames.]      116. Franklin sets up his newspaper; \"sawdust pudding.\"--After his  return to America, Franklin labored so diligently that he was soon  able to set up a newspaper of his own. He tried to make it a good  one. But some people thought that he spoke his mind too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#14)"],[1,"significantly and defiantly.    \"Well, what would you like to eat?\"    \"Like to eat?\" I repeated. \"Why, I could do with a six-course dinner,\"  was my sarcastic rejoinder, feeling confident that he had merely asked  the question to tantalise me. But seeing that he really meant what he  said I rattled off a complete menu, not forgetting the cup of black  coffee and an Egyptian cigarette. Feeling that the officer was in  reality the prison doctor I grew reckless and cynical.    \"Well, I'm damned!\" was his ejaculatory comment when I had finished. And  he gave a loud, long laugh.    My temper was rising, and I think my face must have betrayed my wish to  strangle him, because he continued, \"You've got money, and you can buy  one meal a day from outside if you like. I'll grant you your gluttonous  feed to-day--except the cigarette--seeing that you've eaten nothing for  three days. The cigarette is impossible: it is quite against the rules  and regulations of the prison. But to-morrow you'll have to rest content  with a plate of meat and vegetables.\"    After he had left the cell I came to the conclusion that he had been  merely having a huge joke at my expense. But ten minutes later the  gaoler entered bearing two big trays upon which were arrayed the six  courses. My eyes glittered with a wolfish greed, but I restrained  myself. I sat down to the meal and proceeded with it very leisurely,  getting up now and again to pace a little while to assist my weakened  digestion. Indeed, by the time I had swallowed the last morsel the  gaoler entered with my tea. But that meal put new life into me.  Afterwards I easily subsisted upon the dinner from without; that was  adequate for the twenty-four hours. I think I paid sufficient for the  privilege seeing that the six-course dinner and three subsequent plates  of meat and vegetables cost me twenty-six marks.    While I was denied all conversation with any of the prisoners I saw them  at least once a day. But if I did not see much of them I heard them  frequently, especially when punishment was being dealt out. Then the  corridor would ring with dull thuds as blows by the rifle were  administered, followed by violent shrieking and wailing. The prison, at  least the precincts of the Avenue of the Damned, was ruled with a rod of  iron, and various brutalities were practised and often upon the  slightest pretext. It is only necessary to relate one revolting episode  which I witnessed with my own eyes. On Friday morning, August 7, my  cell-pacing was rudely interrupted by the appearance of the gaoler who  curtly ordered me to stand outside my cell door. I found that all the  cells--except one--along the corridor were wide open, and with their  occupants similarly standing at the entrances. Between each two cells  stood a soldier with his rifle ready to jab his bayonet to right or left  at an instant's notice.    I wondered what was the matter, and was told that we were to witness and  to profit from the punishment which was to be dealt out to a prisoner  who had broken one of the prison rules. Lying in the centre of the  corridor was the prone groaning form of a prisoner--a Frenchman, I  believe--who had been dragged from the cell before the open door of  which no one was standing. He was terribly weak and ill. Beside him  stood four hulking, burly and heavily-booted Prussians.    At the word of command these four men rushed forward and commenced to  kick the hapless prisoner for all they were worth. The man shrieked,  groaned and howled. We all shivered at the sight and at his terrible  cries. It sickened me. But the brutes never relented. The more he  writhed and the louder he howled the harder they kicked, face, body and  head receiving the blows indiscriminately. In a minute or so the man lay  still upon the floor, literally kicked into insensibility. Whatever any  of the prisoners around may have felt none could extend assistance or  interfere. Some strove to shut out the terrible sight by covering their  faces with their hands, but the bayonet point speedily induced them to  look as commanded. If any one of us had moved a step to proceed to the  poor wretch's aid we should certainly have been run through without the  slightest compunction.    The unconscious prisoner was picked up and thrown into his cell, while  we were likewise rushed in upon the conclusion of the disgusting  exhibition. Subsequently I enquired the reason for such a ferocious  outburst. Then I found that the prisoner, who was so ill that he really  ought to have been in hospital, had rung his bell, to summon the gaoler  for permission to respond to one of the calls of nature, but that he had  been unable to contain himself until the dilatory official arrived. I  might mention that I had heard the bell ringing for fully ten minutes  but without avail. Although scrupulous cleanliness is demanded from each  cell I know from experience that the gaolers are ever reluctant to reply  to a call of the emergency bell, and think nothing of causing the  hapless wretch terrible misery. It serves to bring home to the prisoner  that he is under confinement and not in a hotel to be waited on hand  and foot. Such is the German argument.    Next morning on our going into the yard the unfortunate prisoner who had  been punished so diabolically was not to be seen. More significant still  his cell was empty, and the door was wide open. I could only surmise  that his worldly troubles were over. If so he would be officially  declared to have \"died in prison!\"    Favoured prisoners are granted a sack of straw to serve as a mattress. I  had been denied this luxury but secured it later through the good  offices of the lieutenant who visited me on Tuesday night. I was lucky  enough to get new straw. Apparently the sacks are never renewed during a  prisoner's incarceration. He merely replenishes his stock when another  cell becomes vacant, irrespective of the period the straw therein has  been in use. There is a mad rush for the empty cell, and the prisoners  fight like wolves among themselves for the possession of the derelict  straw, each bearing away triumphantly the small dole he has obtained  from the struggle.    As may be supposed, under such conditions, the straw is not very  inviting. It soon becomes verminous, and this deplorable state of  affairs becomes worse the longer the straw is in use. In fact it becomes  alive with lice. In one instance I saw a dropped wisp so thickly  encrusted with the parasites that it actually moved along the ground  under the united action of the insects.    There is one inflexible law in German prisons. Under no pretence  whatever must one prisoner enter the cell of another while it is  occupied. This regulation is not to prevent conversation or  communication between prisoners, but is for reasons which it is not  necessary to describe. When one recalls the utter depravity which  prevails in German military centres the wisdom of the ordination is  obvious. The punishment is severe, the easiest being a spell of  confinement upon a black bread and water diet, but generally and  preferably clubbing into insensibility.    A few cells above me was a prisoner who had been incarcerated for  fifteen years. Whether the whole of this time had been spent in Wesel or  not I could not say, but when I came face to face with him for the first  time he gave me a severe shock. He was a walking skeleton. Every bone in  his body was visible, while his skin was the colour of faded parchment.  He looked more like an animated mummy than a human being. I stood beside  him one day in the corridor, and a bright ray of sunshine happened to  fall across his face which was to me in profile. I started. His face was  so thin that the cheek and jawbones were limned distinctly against the  light, producing the effect of the X-ray photograph, while the sun shone  clean through his cheeks. You could have read a paper on the off side of  his face by the light which came through.    This prisoner unnerved me. From morning to night, as he paced his cell,  he groaned dismally: not fitfully but continually. It was like the wail  of a dog suffering excruciating agony, only a thousand times more  irritating and nerve-racking. Even during the night he groaned,  apparently in his sleep. Another day, when similarly paraded beside him,  I asked if he would like a piece of black bread. He made no reply, but  turned such a wolfish look upon me that I hastily told him to dive into  my cell--No. 11. He watched the guard for a second, and while all backs  were turned he was gone and back beside me with the prize which he  clutched in his hand. I have never seen such a rapid movement. He slid  into the cell like a shadow and as stealthily and as quickly returned.  This poor wretch doubtless enjoyed this unexpected addition to his  quantity of food, since he was apparently being given just enough to  keep him alive, and no more. Otherwise he could never have become so  fearfully thin.    Once again I was to receive another shock from my mysterious prisoner  who had acted as interpreter. On Thursday he came to my cell in the  uniform of a warder. Consequently I saw a good deal of him, and, he  being friendly, we had many brief snatches of surreptitious  conversation. He was highly intelligent, well-educated and sympathetic.  I enquired as to how he happened to be in our unsalubrious avenue. He  informed me that he was awaiting the Kaiser's pardon. His offence was  not heinous. He had not responded to his country's call, upon  mobilisation, with the celerity which the officials declared he should  have shown. As a punishment he was committed to the cells for three  days. Upon the expiration of this sentence he had been made  under-gaoler. His name was M----, and he told me he had a prosperous  business outside Germany.    I was on the tip-toe of anticipation and suppressed excitement  throughout Thursday and Friday, hoping for news"]]]
