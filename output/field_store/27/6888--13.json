But you have  with you seven girls who do know all about the enmity that was buried  here last spring, and who ought to have enough good sense to know that  this afternoon's performance is liable to bring it to life again.    \"If you girls carry this hatchet to school and exhibit it to the seniors  on the day of the game you are apt to start bad feeling all over again,\"  she said, turning to the others. \"There are sure to be some girls in the  senior class who would resent it. Neither class has played tricks on the  other since peace was declared, and we don't want to begin now.    \"That's the reason I asked Grace to appoint a committee of juniors and  come out here with me. I feel sure that under the circumstances the  absent members of both classes would agree with us if they were present.  Digging up a rusty old hatchet is nothing, but digging up a rusty old  grudge is quite another matter. We didn't come here to quarrel, but I  appeal to you, as members of the junior class, to think before you do  something that is bound to cause us all annoyance and perhaps  unhappiness.\"    There was complete silence after Julia finished speaking. What she had  said evidently impressed them. Eleanor alone looked belligerent.    \"Perhaps we'd better let the old hatchet alone,\" Daisy Culver said  sullenly. \"The fun is all spoiled now, and everyone will know about it  before school begins to-morrow.\"    \"Daisy, how can you say so?\" exclaimed Grace, who, fearing a scene with  Eleanor, had hitherto remained silent. \"You know perfectly well that  none of us will say anything about it. Why, we came out here simply to  try to prevent your doing something that might stir up trouble again  between the senior and junior classes. There isn't a girl here who would  be so contemptible as to tell any one outside about what has happened  to-day.\"    This was Eleanor's opportunity. Turning furiously on Grace, her eyes  flashing, she exclaimed: \"Yes, there is one girl who would tell  anything, and that girl is you! You pretend to be honorable and  high-principled, but you are nothing but a hypocrite and a sneak.  I would not trust you as far as I could see you. I have no doubt Miss  Crosby obtained her information about this affair to-day from you, and  that everyone in school will hear it from the same source. You seem  determined to meddle with matters that do not concern you, and I warn  you that if you do not change your tactics you may regret it.    \"You seem to think yourself the idol of your class, but there are some  of the girls who are too clever to be deceived. They do not belong among  the number who trail tamely after you, either. And now I wish to say  that I despise you and all your friends, and wish never to speak to any  of you again. Come on, girls,\" she said, turning to the members of her  party, who had listened in silent amazement to her attack upon Grace.  \"Let us go. Let them keep their trumpery hatchet.\"    With these words she turned and stalked across the field to the road,  where her runabout stood. After an instant's hesitation, she was  followed by Edna, Daisy Culver and those who had come with her.  Henceforth there would again be two distinct factions in the junior  class.    \"Good gracious,\" exclaimed Julia Crosby. \"Talk about your human  whirlwinds! What on earth did you ever do to her, Grace?\"    But Grace could not answer. She was winking hard to keep back the tears.  Twice she attempted to speak and failed. \"Never mind her, dear,\" said  Julia, slipping her arm about Grace, while the other girls gathered  round with many expressions of displeasure at Eleanor's cruel speech.    \"I can't help feeling badly,\" said Grace, with a sob. \"She said such  dreadful things.\"    \"No one who knows you would believe them,\" replied Julia. \"By the way,  who is she? I know her name is Savell and that she's a recent arrival in  Oakdale, but considering the plain and uncomplimentary manner in which  she addressed you, you must have seriously offended her ladyship.\"    \"I'll tell you about her as we walk along,\" replied Grace, wiping her  eyes and smiling a little.    \"Yes, we had better be moving,\" said Julia. \"The battle is over. No one  has been killed and only one wounded. Nevertheless, the enemy has  retired in confusion.\"          CHAPTER XI    WORRIES AND PLANS      Although the girls belonging to Julia's party were silent concerning  what happened at the Omnibus House, the story leaked out, creating  considerable discussion among the members of the two upper classes.  Julia Crosby had a shrewd suspicion that Edna Wright had been the  original purveyor of the news, and in this she was right. Edna had,  under pledge of secrecy, told it to a sophomore, who immediately told it  to her dearest friend, and so the tale traveled until it reached  Eleanor, with numerous additions, far from pleasing to her. She was  thoroughly angry, and at once laid the matter at Grace's door, while her  animosity toward Grace grew daily.    But Grace was not the only person that Eleanor disliked. From the day  that Miss Thompson had taken her to task for absence, she had  entertained a supreme contempt for the principal of which Miss Thompson  was wholly unaware until, encountering Eleanor one morning in the  corridor, the latter had stared at her with an expression of such open  scorn and dislike that Miss Thompson felt her color rise. A direct slap  in the face could scarcely have conveyed greater insult than did that  one insolent glance. The principal was at a loss as to its import. She  wisely decided to ignore it, but stored it up in her memory for future  reference.    The sorority that Eleanor had mentioned in her letter to the Phi Sigma  Tau, was now in full flower. The seven girls who had accompanied her to  the Omnibus House were the chosen members. They wore pins in the shape  of skulls and cross bones, and went about making mysterious signs to  each other whenever they met. The very name of the society was shrouded  in mystery, though Nora O'Malley was heard to declare that she had no  doubt it was a branch of the \"Black Hand.\"    Eleanor was the acknowledged leader, but Edna Wright became a close  second, and between them they managed to disseminate a spirit of  mischief throughout the school that the teachers found hard to combat.    Grace Harlowe watched the trend that affairs were taking with  considerable anxiety. Like herself, there were plenty of girls in school  to whom mischief did not appeal, but Eleanor's beauty, wealth and  fascinating personality were found to dazzle some of the girls, who  would follow her about like sheep, and it was over these girls that  Grace felt worried. If Eleanor were to organize and carry out any  malicious piece of mischief and they were implicated, they would all  have to suffer for what she would be directly responsible. Grace's heart  was with her class. She wished it to be a class among classes, and felt  an almost motherly anxiety for its success.    \"What does ail some of our class?\" she exclaimed to Anne and Nora one  day as they left the school building. \"They seem possessed with imps.  The Phi Sigma Tau girls and a few of the grinds are really the only ones  who behave lately.\"    \"It's largely due to Eleanor, I think,\" replied Anne. \"She seems to have  become quite a power among some of the girls in the class. She is  helping to destroy that spirit of earnestness that you have tried so  hard to cultivate. I think it's a shame, too. The upper class girls  ought to set the example for the two lower classes.\"    \"That's just what worries me,\" said Grace earnestly. \"Hardly a  recitation passes in my class without some kind of disturbance, and it  is always traced to one of the girls in that crowd. The juniors will get  the reputation among the teachers this year that the junior class had  last, and it seems such a pity. I overheard Miss Chester tell Miss Kane  the other day that her junior classes were the most trying of the day,  because she had to work harder to maintain discipline than to teach her  subject.\"    \"That's a nice reputation to carry around, isn't it!\" remarked Nora  indignantly. \"But all we can do is to try harder than ever to make  things go smoothly. I don't believe their society will last long, at any  rate. Those girls are sure to quarrel among themselves, and that will  end the whole thing. Or they may go too far and have Miss Thompson to  reckon with, and that would probably cool their ardor.\"    \"O girls!\" exclaimed Grace. \"Speaking of Miss Thompson, reminds me that  I have something to tell you. What do you suppose the latest is?\"    \"If you know anything new, it is your duty to tell us at once, without  making us beg for it,\" said Nora reprovingly.    \"All right; I accept the reproof,\" said Grace. \"Now for my news. There  is talk of giving a Shakespearian play, with Miss Tebbs to engineer it,  and the cast to be chosen from the three lower classes. The seniors, of  course, will give their own play later.\"    \"How did you find out?\" asked Anne.    \"Miss Thompson herself told me about it,\" replied Grace. \"She called on  mother yesterday afternoon, and, for a wonder, I was at home. She said  that it was not positively decided yet, but if the girls did well with  the mid-year tests, then directly after there would be a try out for  parts, and rehearsals would begin without delay.\"    \"How splendid!\" exclaimed Anne, clasping her hands. \"How I would love to  take part in it!\"    \"You will, without doubt, if there is a try out,\" replied Grace. \"There  is no one in school who can recite as you do; besides, you have been on  the stage.\"    \"I shall try awfully hard for a part, even"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17851"],[0,"The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave (#14)"],[1,"are related in a tone of natural sincerity, and  are accompanied in almost every case with characteristic and minute  details, which must, I conceive, carry with them full conviction to every  candid mind that this negro woman has actually seen, felt, and suffered  all that she so impressively describes; and that the picture she has given  of West Indian slavery is not less true than it is revolting.    But there may be some persons into whose hands this tract may fall, so  imperfectly acquainted with the real character of Negro Slavery, as to be  shocked into partial, if not absolute incredulity, by the acts of inhuman  oppression and brutality related of Capt. I---- and his wife, and of Mr.  D----, the salt manufacturer of Turk's Island. Here, at least, such  persons may be disposed to think, there surely must be _some_  exaggeration; the facts are too shocking to be credible. The facts are  indeed shocking, but unhappily not the less credible on that account.  Slavery is a curse to the oppressor scarcely less than to the oppressed:  its natural tendency is to brutalize both. After a residence myself of six  years in a slave colony, I am inclined to doubt whether, as regards its  _demoralizing_ influence, the master is not even a greater object of  compassion than his bondman. Let those who are disposed to doubt the  atrocities related in this narrative, on the testimony of a sufferer,  examine the details of many cases of similar barbarity that have lately  come before the public, on unquestionable evidence. Passing over the  reports of the Fiscal of Berbice,[23] and the Mauritius horrors recently  unveiled,[24] let them consider the case of Mr. and Mrs. Moss, of the  Bahamas, and their slave Kate, so justly denounced by the Secretary for  the Colonies;[25]--the cases of Eleanor Mead,[26]--of Henry  Williams,[27]--and of the Rev. Mr. Bridges and Kitty Hylton,[28] in  Jamaica. These cases alone might suffice to demonstrate the inevitable  tendency of slavery as it exists in our colonies, to brutalize the master  to a truly frightful degree--a degree which would often cast into the  shade even the atrocities related in the narrative of Mary Prince; and  which are sufficient to prove, independently of all other evidence, that  there is nothing in the revolting character of the facts to affect their  credibility; but that on the contrary, similar deeds are at this very time  of frequent occurrence in almost every one of our slave colonies. The  system of coercive labour may vary in different places; it may be more  destructive to human life in the cane culture of Mauritius and Jamaica,  than in the predial and domestic bondage of Bermuda or the Bahamas,--but  the spirit and character of slavery are every where the same, and cannot  fail to produce similar effects. Wherever slavery prevails, there will  inevitably be found cruelty and oppression. Individuals who have preserved  humane, and amiable, and tolerant dispositions towards their black  dependents, may doubtless be found among slave-holders; but even where a  happy instance of this sort occurs, such as Mary's first mistress, the  kind-hearted Mrs. Williams, the favoured condition of the slave is still  as precarious as it is rare: it is every moment at the mercy of events;  and must always be held by a tenure so proverbially uncertain as that of  human prosperity, or human life. Such examples, like a feeble and  flickering streak of light in a gloomy picture, only serve by contrast to  exhibit the depth of the prevailing shades. Like other exceptions, they  only prove the general rule: the unquestionable tendency of the system is  to vitiate the best tempers, and to harden the most feeling hearts. \"Never  be kind, nor speak kindly to a slave,\" said an accomplished English lady  in South Africa to my wife: \"I have now,\" she added, \"been for some time a  slave-owner, and have found, from vexatious experience in my own  household, that nothing but harshness and hauteur will do with slaves.\"    [Footnote 23: See Anti-Slavery Reporter, Nos. 5 and 16.]    [Footnote 24: Ibid, No. 44.]    [Footnote 25: Ibid, No. 47.]    [Footnote 26: Ibid, No. 64, p. 345; No. 71, p. 481.]    [Footnote 27: Ibid, No. 65, p. 356; No. 69, p. 431.]    [Footnote 28: Anti-Slavery Reporter, Nos. 66, 69, and 76.]    I might perhaps not inappropriately illustrate this point more fully by  stating many cases which fell under my own personal observation, or became  known to me through authentic sources, at the Cape of Good Hope--a colony  where slavery assumes, as it is averred, a milder aspect than in any other  dependency of the empire where it exists; and I could shew, from the  judicial records of that colony, received by me within these few weeks,  cases scarcely inferior in barbarity to the worst of those to which I have  just specially referred; but to do so would lead me too far from the  immediate purpose of this pamphlet, and extend it to an inconvenient  length. I shall therefore content myself with quoting a single short  passage from the excellent work of my friend Dr. Walsh, entitled \"Notices  of Brazil,\"--a work which, besides its other merits, has vividly  illustrated the true spirit of Negro Slavery, as it displays itself not  merely in that country, but wherever it has been permitted to open its  Pandora's box of misery and crime.    Let the reader ponder on the following just remarks, and compare the facts  stated by the Author in illustration of them, with the circumstances  related at pages 6 and 7 of Mary's narrative:--         \"If then we put out of the question the injury inflicted on       others, and merely consider the deterioration of feeling and       principle with which it operates on ourselves, ought it not       to be a sufficient, and, indeed, unanswerable argument,       against the permission of Slavery?         \"The exemplary manner in which the paternal duties are       performed at home, may mark people as the most fond and       affectionate parents; but let them once go abroad, and come       within the contagion of slavery, and it seems to alter the       very nature of a man; and the father has sold, and still       sells, the mother and his children, with as little       compunction as he would a sow and her litter of pigs; and he       often disposes of them together.         \"This deterioration of feeling is conspicuous in many ways       among the Brazilians. They are naturally a people of a       humane and good-natured disposition, and much indisposed to       cruelty or severity of any kind. Indeed, the manner in which       many of them treat their slaves is a proof of this, as it is       really gentle and considerate; but the natural tendency to       cruelty and oppression in the human heart, is continually       evolved by the impunity and uncontrolled licence in which       they are exercised. I never walked through the streets of       Rio, that some house did not present to me the semblance of       a bridewell, where the moans and the cries of the sufferers,       and the sounds of whips and scourges within, announced to me       that corporal punishment was being inflicted. Whenever I       remarked this to a friend, I was always answered that the       refractory nature of the slave rendered it necessary, and no       house could properly be conducted unless it was practised.       But this is certainly not the case; and the chastisement is       constantly applied in the very wantonness of barbarity, and       would not, and dared not, be inflicted on the humblest       wretch in society, if he was not a slave, and so put out of       the pale of pity.         \"Immediately joining our house was one occupied by a       mechanic, from which the most dismal cries and moans       constantly proceeded. I entered the shop one day, and found       it was occupied by a saddler, who had two negro boys working       at his business. He was a tawny, cadaverous-looking man,       with a dark aspect; and he had cut from his leather a       scourge like a Russian knout, which he held in his hand, and       was in the act of exercising on one of the naked children in       an inner room: and this was the cause of the moans and cries       we heard every day, and almost all day long.         \"In the rear of our house was another, occupied by some       women of bad character, who kept, as usual, several negro       slaves. I was awoke early one morning by dismal cries, and       looking out of the window, I saw in the back yard of the       house, a black girl of about fourteen years old; before her       stood her mistress, a white woman, with a large stick in her       hand. She was undressed except her petticoat and chemise,       which had fallen down and left her shoulders and bosom bare.       Her hair was streaming behind, and every fierce and       malevolent passion was depicted in her face. She too, like       my hostess at Governo [another striking illustration of the       _dehumanizing_ effects of Slavery,] was the very       representation of a fury. She was striking the poor girl,       whom she had driven up into a corner, where she was on her       knees appealing for mercy. She shewed her none, but       continued to strike her on the head and thrust the stick       into her face, till she was herself exhausted, and her poor       victim covered with blood. This scene was renewed every       morning, and the cries and moans of the poor suffering       blacks, announced that they were enduring the penalty of       slavery, in being the objects on which the irritable and       malevolent passions of the whites are allowed to vent       themselves with impunity; nor could I help deeply deploring       that state of society in which the vilest characters in the       community are allowed an almost uncontrolled power of life       and death, over their innocent, and far more estimable       fellow-creatures.\"--(Notic"]]]
