(_There is the shuffling of footsteps from outside and five of the  crew crowd into the cabin, led by_ JOE. _All are dressed  alike--sweaters, sea-boots, etc. They glance uneasily at the_  CAPTAIN, _twirling their fur caps in their hands._)    KEENEY (_after a pause_). Well? Who's to speak fur ye?    JOE (_stepping forward with an air of bravado_). I be.    KEENEY (_eyeing him up and down coldly_). So you be. Then speak  your say and be quick about it.    JOE (_trying not to wilt before the CAPTAIN'S glance and avoiding  his eyes_). The time we signed up for is done to-day.    KEENEY (_icily_). You're tellin' me nothin' I don't know.    JOE. You ain't p'intin' fur home yit, far's we kin see.    KEENEY. No, and I ain't agoin' to till this ship is full of ile.    JOE. You can't go no further no'the with the ice afore ye.    KEENEY. The ice is breaking up.    JOB (_after a slight pause during which the others mumble angrily  to one another_). The grub we're gittin' now is rotten.    KEENEY. It's good enough fur ye. Better men than ye are have  eaten worse.    (_There is a chorus of angry exclamations from the crowd._)    JOE (_encouraged by this support_). We ain'ta-goin' to work no more  'less you puts back fur home.    KEENEY (_fiercely_). You ain't, ain't you?    JOE. No; and the law courts 'll say we was right.    KEENEY. To hell with your law courts! We're at sea now and I'm  the law on this ship. (_Edging up toward the harpooner._) And every  mother's son of you what don't obey orders goes in irons.    (_There are more angry exclamations from the crew._ MRS. KEENEY  _appears in the doorway in rear and looks on with startled eyes.  None of the men notices her._)    JOE (_with bravado_). Then we're a-goin' to mutiny and take the  old hooker home ourselves. Ain't we, boys?    (_As he turns his head to look at the others_, KEENEY'S _fist  shoots out to the side of his jaw._ JOE _goes down in a heap and  lies there._ MRS. KEENEY _gives a shriek and hides her face in  her hands. The men pull out their sheath knives and start a rush,  but stop when they find themselves confronted by the revolvers  of_ KEENEY _and the_ MATE.)    KEENEY (_his eyes and voice snapping_). Hold still! (_The men  stand huddled together in a sullen silence._ KEENEY'S _voice is  full of mockery._) You've found out it ain't safe to mutiny on  this ship, ain't you? And now git for'ard where ye belong, and  (_he gives_ JOE'S _body a contemptuous kick_) drag him with you.  And remember, the first man of ye I see shirkin' I'll shoot dead  as sure as there's a sea under us, and you can tell the rest the  same. Git for'ard now! Quick! (_The men leave in cowed silence,  carrying_ JOE _with them._ KEENEY _turns to the_ MATE _with a  short laugh and puts his revolver back in his pocket._) Best get  up on deck, Mr. Slocum, and see to it they don't try none of  their skulkin' tricks. We'll have to keep an eye peeled from now  on. I know 'em.    MATE. Yes, sir.    (_He goes out, right._ KEENEY _hears his wife's hysterical  weeping and turns around in surprise--then walks slowly to her  side._)    KEENEY (_putting an arm around her shoulder--with gruff  tenderness_). There, there, Annie. Don't be afeard. It's all past  and gone.    MRS. KEENEY (_shrinking away from, him_). Oh, I can't bear it! I  can't bear it any longer!    KEENEY (_gently_). Can't bear what, Annie?    MRS. KEENEY (_hysterically_). All this horrible brutality, and  these brutes of men, and this terrible ship, and this prison cell  of a room, and the ice all around, and the silence.    (_After this outburst she calms down and wipes her eyes with her  handkerchief._)    KEENEY (_after a pause during which he looks down at her with a  puzzled frown_). Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on  this voyage, Annie.    MRS. KEENEY. I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I  didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've  been doing these last six years since we were married--waiting,  and watching, and fearing--with nothing to keep my mind  occupied--not able to go back teaching school on account of being  Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great,  wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger  and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they  make you out to be in Homeport. And instead--(_her voice grows  tremulous_) all I find is ice--and cold--and brutality!    (_Her voice breaks._)    KEENEY. I warned you what it'd be, Annie. \"Whalin' ain't no  ladies' tea party,\" I says to you, \"and you better stay to home  where you've got all your woman's comforts.\" (_Shaking his head_)  But you was so set on it.    MRS. KEENEY (_wearily_). Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You  see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old  Vikings in the story-books and I thought you were one of them.    KEENEY (_protestingly_). I done my best to make it as cozy and  comfortable as could be. (MRS. KEENEY _looks around her in wild  scorn._) I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin'  it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was  calms and things was dull like.    MRS. KEENEY (_wearily_). Yes, you were very kind, David. I know  that. (_She goes to left and lifts the curtains from the porthole  and looks out--then suddenly bursts forth._) I won't stand it--I  can't stand it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. (_She runs  over to him and throws her arms around him, weeping. He puts his  arm protectingly over her shoulders._) Take me away from here,  David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship,  I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel  as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain.  I'm afraid. Take me home!    KEENEY (_holds her at arm's length and looks at her face  anxiously_). Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got  fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you  look this way before.    MRS. KEENEY (_laughing hysterically_). It's the ice and the cold  and the silence--they'd make anyone look strange.    KEENEY (_soothingly_). In a month or two, with good luck, three at  the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her  everything she'll stand and p'int for home.    MRS. KEENEY. But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to  get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's  cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back.  You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If  you've a heart at all, you've got to turn back.    KEENEY (_harshly_). I can't, Annie.    MRS. KEENEY. Why can't you?    KEENEY. A woman couldn't rightly understand my reason.    MRS. KEENEY (_wildly_). Because it's a stupid, stubborn reason. Oh,  I heard you talking with the second mate. You're afraid the other  captains will sneer at you because you didn't come back with a  full ship. You want to live up to our silly reputation even if  you do have to beat and starve men and drive me mad to do it.    KEENEY (_his jaw set stubbornly_). It ain't that, Annie. Them  skippers would never dare sneer to my face. It ain't so much what  anyone'd say--but--(_He hesitates, struggling to express his  meaning._) You see--I've always done it--since my first voyage as  skipper. I always come back--with a full ship--and--it don't seem  right not to--somehow. I been always first whalin' skipper out o'  Homeport, and--Don't you see my meanin', Annie? (_He glances at  her. She is not looking at him but staring dully in front of her,  not hearing a word he is saying._) Annie! (_She comes to herself  with a start._) Best turn in, Annie, there's a good woman. You  ain't well.    MRS. KEENEY (_resisting his attempts to guide her to the door in  rear_). David! Won't you please turn back?    KEENEY (_gently_). I can't, Annie--not yet awhile. You don't see my  meanin'. I got to git the ile.    MRS. KEENEY. It'd be different if you needed the money, but you  don't. You've got more than plenty.    KEENEY (_impatiently_). It ain't the money I'm thinkin' of. D'you  think I'm as mean as that?    MRS. KEENEY (_dully_). No--I don't know--I can't  understand--(_Intensely_) Oh, I want to be home in the old house  once more and see my own kitchen again, and hear a woman's voice  talking to me and be able to talk to her. Two years! It seems so  long ago--as if I'd been dead and could never go back.    KEENEY (_worried by her strange tone and the far-away look in her  eyes_). Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't well.    MRS. KEENEY (_not appearing to hear him_). I used to be lonely when  you were away. I used to think Homeport was a stupid, monotonous  place. Then I used to go down on the beach, especially when it  was windy and the breakers were rolling in, and I'd dream of the  fine free life you must be leading. (_She gives a laugh which is  half a sob._) I used to love the sea then. (_She pauses; then  continues with slow intensity._) But now--I don't ever want to see  the sea again.    KEENEY (_thinking to humor her_). 'Tis no fit place for a woman,  that's sure. I was a fool to bring ye.    MRS. KEENEY (_after a pause--passing her hand over her eyes with a  gesture of pathetic weariness_). How long would it take us to  reach home--if we started now?    KEENEY (_frowning_). 'Bout two months, I reckon, Annie, with fair  luck.    MRS. KEENEY (_counts on her fingers--then murmurs with a rapt  smile_). That would be August, the latter part of August, wouldn't  it? It was on the twenty-fifth of August we were married, David,  wasn't it?    KEENEY (_trying to conceal the fact that her memories have moved  him--gruffly_). Don't you remember?    MRS. KEENEY (_vaguely--again passes her hand over her eyes_). My  memory is leaving me--up here in the ice. It was so long ago. (_A  pause--then she smiles dreamily._) It's June now.

This will keep so a long time. She useth  this way most. It makes the Mead drink exceeding quick and pleasant. When  you pierce the Cask, it will flie out with exceeding force, and be ready to  throw out the stopper and spigot.      TO MAKE WHITE MEATH    Take Rosemary, Thyme, Sweet-bryar, Penyroyal, Bayes, of each one handful;  steep them 24 hours in a bowl of fair cold water covered close; next day  boil them very well in another water, till the colour be very high; then  take another water, and boil the same herbs in it, till it look green; and  so boil them in several waters, till they do but just change the colour of  the water. The first waters are thrown away. The last water must stand 24  hours with the herbs in it. The Liquor being strained from them, you must  put in as much fine honey till it will bear an Egge; you must work and  labour the honey with the Liquor a whole day, till the honey be consumed;  then let it stand a night a clearing. In the morning put your Liquor a  boiling for a quarter of an hour, with the whites and shells of six Eggs.  So strain it through a bag, and let it stand a day a cooling; so Tun it up,  and put into the vessel in a Linnen bag, Cloves, Mace, Cinamon and Nutmegs  bruised altogether. If you will have it to drink presently, take the whites  of two or three Eggs, of barm a spoonful, and as much of Wheaten-flower.  Then let it work before you stop it, afterwards stop it well with Clay and  Salt. A quart of Honey to a Gallon of liquor, and so proportionably for  these Herbs.      SIR WILLIAM PASTON'S MEATHE    Take ten Gallons of Spring-water, and put therein ten Pints of the best  honey. Let this boil half an hour, and scum it very well; then put in one  handful of Rosemary, and as much of Bay-leaves; with a little Limon-peel.  Boil this half an hour longer, then take it off the fire, and put it into a  clean Tub; and when it is cool, work it up with yest, as you do Beer. When  it is wrought, put it into your vessel, and stop it very close. Within  three days you may Bottle it, and in ten days after it will be fit to  drink.      ANOTHER PLEASANT MEATHE OF SIR WILLIAM PASTON'S    To a Gallon of water put a quart of honey, about ten sprigs of  Sweet-Majoram; half so many tops of Bays. Boil these very well together,  and when it is cold, bottle it up. It will be ten days before it be ready  to drink.      ANOTHER WAY OF MAKING MEATH    Boil Sweet Bryar, Sweet Marjoram, Cloves and Mace in Spring-water, till the  water taste of them. To four Gallons of water put one Gallon of honey, and  boil it a little to skim and clarifie it. When you are ready to take it  from the fire, put in a little Limon-peel, and pour it into a Woodden  vessel, and let it stand till it is almost cold. Then put in some Ale-yest,  and stir it altogether. So let it stand till next day. Then put a few  stoned Raisins of the Sun into every bottle, and pour the Meath upon them.  Stop the bottles close, and in a week the Meath will be ready to drink.      SIR BAYNAM THROCKMORTON'S MEATHE.    Take four quarts of Honey, good measure; put to it four Gallons of water,  let it stand all night, but stir it well, when you put it together. The  next day boil it, and put to it Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace and Ginger, of each  half an ounce. Let these boil with the honey and water till it will bear an  Egge at the top without sinking; and then it is enough, if you see the Egge  the breadth of a sixpence. The next day put it in your vessel, and put  thereto two or three spoonfuls of barm; and when it hath done working, you  may (if you like it) put in a little Ambergreece in a clout with a stone to  it to make it sink. This should be kept a whole year before it be drunk; it  will drink much the better, free from any tast of the honey, and then it  will look as clear as Sack. Make it not till Michaelmas, and set it in a  cool place. You may drink it a quarter old, but it will not taste so  pleasant then, as when it is old.      TO MAKE WHITE METHEGLIN    Take a Gallon of Honey; put to it four Gallons of water; stir them well  together, and boil them in a Kettle, till a Gallon be wasted with boiling  and scumming. Then put it into a vessel to cool. When it is almost as cold  as Ale-wort, then clear it out into another vessel: Then put Barm upon it,  as you do to your Ale, and so let it work. And then Tun it up into a  vessel, and put into it a bag with Ginger, Cloves, and Cinamon bruised a  little, and so hang the bag in the vessel, and stop it up very close; and  when it hath stood a month or six weeks, bottle it up and so drink it. You  may put in a little Limmon-peel into some of your Metheglin, for those that  like that taste; which most persons do very much.      A RECEIPT FOR MAKING OF MEATH    Mistress Hebden telleth me, that the way of making Honey-drink in Russia,  is thus; Take for example, 100 Gallons of Spring water, boil it a little;  then let it stand 24 hours to cool, and much sediment will fall to the  bottom; from which pour the clear, and warm it, and put 20 or 25 Gallons of  pure honey to it, and lade it a long time with a great woodden battle-dore,  till it be well dissolved. The next day boil it gently, till you have  skimed off all the scum that will rise, and that it beareth an Egge boyant.  And in this Liquor you must put, in the due time, a little quantity of  Hops, about two handfuls, which must boil sufficiently in the Liquor. Put  this into the cooling fat to cool two or three days. When it is about  milk-warm, take white-bread and cut it into tosts, upon which, (when they  are hot) spread moderately thick some fresh sweet Ale-yest; and cover the  superficies of the Liquor with such tosts; Then cover the Tub or Fat with a  double course sheet, and a blancket or two, which tye fast about it. This  will make your Liquor work up highly. When you find it is near it's height  of working, and that the Liquor is risen to the top of the Tub (of which it  wanted 8 or 10 Inches at first,) Skim off the tosts and yest, and Tun it up  in a hogshead: which stop close; but after 24 hours draw it into another  barrel: for it will leave a great deal of sediment. It will work again in  this second barrel. After other 24 hours draw it into another barrel, and  then it will be clear and pale like White-wine. Stop it up close, hanging a  bag of bruised spice in the bung; and after five or six months, it will be  fit to drink. If you would have your Meath taste of Raspes, or Cherries  (Morello, sharp Cherries, are the best) prepare the water first with them;  by putting five or six Gallons of either of these fruits, or more, into  this proportion of water; in which bruise them to have all their juyce: but  strain the Liquor from the Grains or Seeds, or Stones. And then proceed  with this tincted water, as is said above. You may make your Liquor as  strong, as you like, of the fruit. Cardamon-seeds mingled with the  suspended spices, adde much to the pleasantness of the drink. Limon-peel,  as also Elder-flowers.      MY LADY BELLASSISES MEATH    The way of making is thus. She boileth the honey with Spring-water, as I  do, till it be cleer scumed; then to every Gallon of Honey, put in a pound  or two of good Raisins of the Sun; boil them well, and till the Liquor bear  an Egge. Then pour it into a Cowl or Tub to cool. In about 24 hours it will  be cool enough to put the yest to it, being onely Lukewarm: which do thus:  spread yest upon a large hot tost, and lay it upon the top of the Liquor,  and cover the Tub well, first with a sheet, then with coverlets, that it  may work well. When it is wrought up to it's height, before it begin to  sink, put it into your barrel, letting it run through a loose open  strainer, to sever the Raisins and dregs from it. Stop it up close, and  after it hath been thus eight or ten days, draw it into bottles, and into  every bottle put a cod of Cardamoms, having first a little bruised them as  they lie in the cod; and opening the cod a little, that the Liquor may  search into it. Stop your bottles close, and after three or four moneths  you may drink, and it will be very pleasant and quick, and look like white  wine.      ANOTHER METHEGLIN    In every three Gallons of water, boil Rosemary, Liverwort, Balm, _ana_,  half a handful, and Cowslips two handfuls. When the water hath sufficiently  drawn out the vertue of the herbs, pour all into a Tub, and let it stand  all night. Then strain it. And to every three Gallons of the clear Liquor  (or 2-1/2, if you will have your drink stronger) put one Gallon of honey,  and boil it, till it bear an Egge, scuming it till no more scum will rise:  which to make rise the better, put in now and then a Porrenger full of cold  water. Then pour it into a Tub, and let it stand to cool, till it be blood  warm, and then put by degrees a Pint of Ale-yest to it, to make it work. So  let it stand three days very close covered. Then skim off the yest, and put  it into a seasoned barrel; but stop it not up close, till it have done  hissing. Then either stop it very close, if you will keep it in the barrel,  or draw it into bottles. Put into this proportion, Ginger sliced, Nutmegs  broken, _ana_, one ounce, Cinamon bruised half an ounce in a bag, which  hang in the bung with a stone in it to make it sink. You may add, if you  please, to this proportion of water, or one Gallon more, two handfuls of  Sweet-bryar-leaves, and one of Betony.      MR. PIERCE'S EXCELLENT WHITE METHEGLIN    In a Copper, that holdeth conveniently three hogsheads, or near so much,  boil the best water, (as full as is fitting). As soon as it boileth well  and high, put to it four handfuls of Sweet-bryar-leaves, as much of  Eye-bright: two handfuls of Rosemary, as much of Sweet-Marjoram, and one of  Broad-thyme. Let them boil a quarter of an hour (He letteth them boil no  longer, to preserve the colour of the Metheglin pale) then scum"]]]
