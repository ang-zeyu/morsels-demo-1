I wanted to keep her for myself; but  my duty to her was clear.    \"And now, squire, you know all about it. I have been wrong to keep her  so long from you, I grant; but I can only say that I have done my duty,  as far as I could, and that, though I have made many mistakes, my  conscience is clear, that I did the best, as far as it seemed to me at  the time.\"        Chapter 5: A Quiet Time.      As the sergeant was telling the story, the squire had sat with his face  shaded by his hand, but more than one tear had dropped heavily on the  table.    \"I wish I could say as much,\" he said sadly, when the other ended. \"I  wish that I could say that my conscience is clear, Mr. Wilks. I have  misjudged you cruelly, and that without a tithe of the reason, which  you had, for thinking me utterly heartless and cruel. You will have  heard that I never got those letters my son wrote me, after he was ill,  and that, when I returned home and received them, I posted to  Southampton, only to find that I was too late; and that, for a year, I  did all in my power to find the child. Still, all this is no excuse. I  refused to forgive him, returned his letters unanswered, and left him,  as it seemed, to his fate.    \"It is no excuse to say that I had made up my mind to forgive him, when  he was, as I thought, sufficiently punished. He did not know that. As  to the poverty in which you found him, I can only plead that I did not  dream that he would come to that. He had, I knew, some money, for I had  just sent him his half-year's allowance before he wrote to me about  this business. Then there was the furniture of his rooms in London, his  horses, jewels, and other matters. I had thought he could go on very  well for a year.    \"Of course, I was mistaken. Herbert was always careless about money,  and, no doubt, he spent it freely after he was first married. He would  naturally wish to have everything pretty and nice for his young wife,  and, no doubt, he counted upon my forgiving him long before the money  was spent.    \"I am not excusing myself. God knows how bitterly I have condemned  myself, all these years. I only want to show you that I had no idea of  condemning him to starvation. He was my only son, and I loved him. I  felt, perhaps, his rebellion all the more, because he had never before  given me a day's trouble. I was harsh, obstinate, and cruel.    \"I have only the one old excuse. I never thought it would turn out as  it did. What would I give, if I could say, as you can, that you have a  clear conscience, and that you acted always as it seemed to be your  duty!    \"And now, Mr. Wilks, now that I have heard your story, I trust that you  will forgive my past suspicions of you, and let me say how much I  honour and esteem you for your conduct. No words can tell you how I  thank you, for your goodness and kindness to my little granddaughter;  our little granddaughter, I should say. You have the better right, a  thousand-fold, to her than I have; and, had I been in your place, I  could never have made such a sacrifice.    \"We must be friends, sir, great friends. Our past has been saddened by  the same blow. All our hopes, in the future, are centred on the same  object.\"    The two men rose to their feet together, and their hands met in a firm  clasp, and tears stood in both their eyes.    Then the squire put his hand on the other's shoulder, and said, \"We  will talk again, presently. Let us go into the next room. The little  one is longing to see you, and we must not keep her.\"    For the next hour, the two men devoted themselves to the child. Now  that she had her old friend with her, she felt no further misgivings,  and was able to enter into the full delight of her new home.    The house and its wonders were explored, and, much as she was delighted  with these, the gardens and park were an even greater excitement and  pleasure. Dancing, chattering, asking questions of one or the other,  she was half wild with pleasure, and the squire was no less delighted.  A new light and joy had come into his life, and with it the ten years,  which sorrow and regret had laid upon him, had fallen off; for,  although his habits of seclusion and quiet had caused him to be  regarded as quite an old man by his neighbours, he was still three  years short of sixty, while the sergeant was two years younger.    It was a happy morning for them, all three; and when John Petersham  went in, after lunch, to the kitchen, he assured his fellow servants  that it was as much as he could do to keep from crying with joy, at the  sight of the squire's happy face, and to hear him laugh and joke, as he  had not done for eight years now.    The sergeant had stopped to that meal, for he saw, by the manner in  which the squire asked him, that he should give pain if he refused; and  there was a simple dignity about the old soldier, which would have  prevented his appearing out of place at the table of the highest in the  land.    \"Now, pussy,\" the squire said, when they had finished, \"you must amuse  yourself for a bit. You can go in the garden again, or sit with Mrs.  Morcombe in her room. She will look you out some picture books from the  library. I am afraid there is nothing very suited to your reading, but  we will soon put all that right. Your grandfather and I want to have  another quiet chat together.\"    \"Now I want your advice,\" he said when they were both comfortably  seated in the study. \"You see, you have been thinking and planning  about the child for years, while it has all come new upon me, so I must  rely upon you entirely. Of course, the child must have a governess,  that is the first thing; not so much for the sake of teaching her,  though, of course, she must be taught, but as a companion for her.\"    \"Yes,\" the sergeant assented, \"she must have a governess.\"    \"It will be a troublesome matter to find one to suit,\" the squire said  thoughtfully. \"I don't want a harsh sort of Gorgon, to repress her  spirits and bother her life out with rules and regulations; and I won't  have a giddy young thing, because I should like to have the child with  me at breakfast and lunch, and I don't want a fly-away young woman who  will expect all sorts of attention. Now, what is your idea? I have no  doubt you have, pictured in your mind, the exact sort of woman you  would like to have over her.\"    \"I have,\" the sergeant answered quietly. \"I don't know whether it would  suit you, squire, or whether it could be managed; but it does seem, to  me, that you have got the very woman close at hand. Aggie has been for  two years with Mrs. Walsham, who is a lady in every way. She is very  fond of the child, and the child is very fond of her. Everyone says she  is an excellent teacher. She would be the very woman to take charge of  her.\"    \"The very thing!\" the squire exclaimed, with great satisfaction. \"But  she has a school,\" he went on, his face falling a little, \"and there is  a son.\"    \"I have thought of that,\" the sergeant said. \"The school enables them  to live, but it cannot do much more, so that I should think she would  feel no reluctance at giving that up.\"    \"Money would be no object,\" the squire said. \"I am a wealthy man, Mr.  Wilks, and have been laying by the best part of my income for the last  eight years. I would pay any salary she chose, for the comfort of such  an arrangement would be immense, to say nothing of the advantage and  pleasure it would be to the child. But how about the boy?\"    \"We both owe a good deal to the boy, squire,\" the sergeant said  gravely, \"for if it had not been for him, the child would have been  lost to us.\"    \"So she was telling me last night,\" the squire said. \"And he really  saved her life?\"    \"He did,\" the sergeant replied. \"But for his pluck and promptitude she  must have been drowned. A moment's hesitation on his part, and nothing  could have saved her.\"    \"I made up my mind last night,\" the squire said, \"to do something for  him. I have seen him before, and was much struck with him.\"    \"Then, in that case, squire, I think the thing could be managed. If the  lad were sent to a good school, his mother might undertake the  management of Aggie. She could either go home of an evening, or sleep  here and shut up her house, as you might arrange with her; living, of  course, at home, when the boy was home for his holidays, and only  coming up for a portion of the day.\"    \"That would be a capital plan,\" the squire agreed warmly. \"The very  thing. I should get off all the bother with strange women, and the  child would have a lady she is already fond of, and who, I have no  doubt, is thoroughly qualified for the work. Nothing could be better. I  will walk down this afternoon and see her myself, and I have no doubt I  shall be able to arrange it.    \"And now about yourself--what are your plans?\"    \"I shall start tomorrow morning on my tramp, as usual,\" the sergeant  answered quietly; \"but I shall take care, in future, that I do not come  with my box within thirty miles or so of Sidmouth. I do not want  Aggie's future to be, in any way, associated with a showman's box. I  shall come here, sometimes, to see her, as you have kindly said I may,  but I will not abuse the privilege by coming too often. Perhaps you  won't think a day, once every three months, to be too much?\"    \"I should think it altogether wrong and monstrous!\" the squire  exclaimed hotly. \"You have been virtually the child's father, for the  last seven years. You have cared for her, and loved her, and worked for  her. She is everything to you, and I feel how vast are your claims to  her, compared to mine; and now you talk about going away, and coming to  see her once every three months."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#14)"],[1,"funny that Granny forgot her cares and worries and  laughed with little Gretchen over her new snow dance. The days passed  on and the morning before Christmas Eve came. Gretchen having tidied  up the little room--for Granny had taught her to be a careful little  housewife--was off to the forest, singing a birdlike song, almost as  happy and free as the birds themselves. She was very busy that day  preparing a surprise for Granny. First, however, she gathered the most  beautiful of the fir branches within her reach to take the next  morning to the old sick man who lived by the mill.    The day was all too short for the happy little girl. When Granny came  trudging wearily home that night, she found the frame of the doorway  covered with green pine branches.    \"It is to welcome you, Granny! It is to welcome you!\" cried Gretchen;  \"our dear old home wanted to give you a Christmas welcome. Don't you  see, the branches of the evergreen make it look as if it were smiling  all over, and it is trying to say, 'A happy Christmas to you Granny'.\"    Granny laughed and kissed the little girl, as they opened the door and  went in together. Here was a new surprise for Granny. The four posts  of the wooden bed, which stood in one corner of the room, had been  trimmed by the busy little fingers, with smaller and more flexible  branches of the pine trees. A small bouquet of red mountain ash  berries stood at each side of the fireplace, and these, together with  the trimmed posts of the bed, gave the plain old room quite a festive  look. Gretchen laughed and clapped her hands and danced about until  the house seemed full of music to poor, tired Granny, whose heart had  been sad as she turned toward their home that night, thinking of the  disappointment that must come to loving little Gretchen the next  morning.    After supper was over little Gretchen drew her stool up to Granny's  side, and laying her soft, little hands on Granny's knee asked to be  told once again the story of the coming of the Christ-Child; how the  night that he was born the beautiful angels had sung their wonderful  song, and how the whole sky had become bright with a strange and  glorious light, never seen by the people of earth before. Gretchen had  heard the story many, many times before, but she never grew tired of  it, and now that Christmas Eve had come again, the happy little child  wanted to hear it once more.    When Granny had finished telling it the two sat quiet and silent for a  little while thinking it over; then Granny rose and said that it was  time for her to go to bed. She slowly took off her heavy wooden shoes,  such as are worn in that country, and placed them beside the hearth.  Gretchen looked thoughtfully at them for a minute or two, and then she  said, \"Granny, don't you think that _somebody_ in all this wide world  will think of us tonight?\"    \"Nay, Gretchen, I do not think any one will.\"    \"Well, then, Granny,\" said Gretchen, \"the Christmas angels will, I  know; so I am going to take one of your wooden shoes and put it on the  windowsill outside, so that they may see it as they pass by. I am sure  the stars will tell the Christmas angels where the shoe is.\"    \"Ah, you foolish, foolish child,\" said Granny, \"you are only getting  ready for a disappointment. Tomorrow morning there will be nothing  whatever in the shoe. I can tell you that now.\"    But little Gretchen would not listen. She only shook her head and  cried out: \"Ah, Granny, you do not talk enough to the stars.\" With  this she seized the shoe, and opening the door, hurried out to place  it on the window sill. It was very dark without and something soft and  cold seemed to gently kiss her hair and face. Gretchen knew by this  that it was snowing, and she looked up to the sky, anxious to see if  the stars were in sight, but a strong wind was tumbling the dark,  heavy snow-clouds about and had shut away all else.    \"Never mind,\" said Gretchen softly to herself, \"the stars are up  there, even if I can't see them, and the Christmas angels do not mind  snow storms.\"    Just then a rough wind went sweeping by the little girl, whispering  something to her which she could not understand, and then it made a  sudden rush up to the snow clouds and parted them, so that the deep  mysterious sky appeared beyond, and shining down out of the midst of  it was Gretchen's favorite star.    \"Ah, little star, little star!\" said the child, laughing aloud, \"I  knew you were there, though I could not see you. Will you whisper to  the Christmas angels as they come by that little Gretchen wants so  very much to have a Christmas gift tomorrow morning, if they have one  to spare, and that she has put one of Granny's shoes upon the  windowsill for it?\"    A moment more and the little girl, standing on tiptoe had reached the  windowsill and placed the shoe upon it, and was back again in the  house beside Granny and the warm fire.    The two went quietly to bed, and that night as little Gretchen knelt  to pray to the Heavenly Father, she thanked him for having sent the  Christ-Child into the world to teach all mankind to be loving and  unselfish, and in a few minutes she was sleeping, dreaming of the  Christmas angels.    The next morning, very early, even before the sun was up, little  Gretchen was awakened by the sound of sweet music coming from the  village. She listened for a moment and then she knew that the choir  boys were singing the Christmas carols in the open air of the village  street. She sprang up out of bed and began to dress herself as quickly  as possible, singing as she dressed. While Granny was slowly putting  on her clothes, little Gretchen having finished dressing herself,  unfastened the door and hurried out to see what the Christmas angels  had left in the old wooden shoe.    The white snow covered everything--trees, stumps, roads, and  pastures--until the whole world looked like fairy land. Gretchen  climbed up on a large stone which was beneath the window and carefully  lifted down the wooden shoe. The snow tumbled off of it in a shower  over the little girl's hands, but she did not heed that; she ran  hurriedly back into the house, putting her hand into the toe of the  shoe as she ran.    \"Oh, Granny, Granny!\" she exclaimed; \"you did not believe the  Christmas angels would think about us, but see, they have, they have!  Here is a dear little bird nestled down in the toe of your shoe! Oh,  isn't he beautiful?\"    Granny came forward and looked at what the child was holding lovingly  in her hand. There she saw a tiny chick-a-dee, whose wing was  evidently broken by the rough and boisterous winds of the night  before, and who had taken shelter in the safe, dry toe of the old  wooden shoe. She gently took the little bird out of Gretchen's hands,  and skilfully bound his broken wing to his side, so that he need not  hurt himself trying to fly with it. Then she showed Gretchen how to  make a nice warm nest for the little stranger, close beside the fire  and when their breakfast was ready, she let Gretchen feed the little  bird with a few moist crumbs.    Later in the day Gretchen carried the fresh, green boughs to the old  sick man by the mill, and on her way home stopped to enjoy the  Christmas toys of some other children that she knew, never once  wishing they were hers. When she reached home she found that the  little bird had gone to sleep. Soon, however, he opened his eyes and  stretched his head up, saying just as plain as a bird can say:    \"Now, my new friends, I want you to give me something more to eat.\"  Gretchen gladly fed him again, and then, holding him in her lap, she  softly and gently stroked his gray feathers until the little creature  seemed to lose all fear of her. That evening Granny taught her a  Christmas hymn and told her another beautiful Christmas story. Then  Gretchen made up a funny little story to tell the birdie. He winked  his eyes and turned his head from side to side in such a droll fashion  that Gretchen laughed until the tears came.    As Granny and she got ready for bed that night, Gretchen put her arms  softly around Granny's neck, and whispered: \"What a beautiful  Christmas we have had today, Granny. Is there anything more lovely in  all the world than Christmas?\"    \"Nay, child, nay,\" said Granny, \"not to such loving hearts as yours.\"    [*] Reprinted by permission of the author from her collection,  \"Christmastide.\" Published by the Chicago Kindergarten College.          THE LITTLE SHEPHERD[*]    By Maud Lindsay      The shepherd was sick and the shepherd's wife looked out from her door  with anxious eyes. \"Who will carry the sheep to the pasture lands  today?\" she said to her little boy Jean.    \"I will,\" cried Jean, \"I will. Mother, let me.\"    Jean and his father and mother lived long ago in a sunny land across  the sea, where flowers bloom, and birds sing, and shepherds feed their  flocks in the green valleys. Every morning, as soon as it was light,  Jean's father was up and away with his sheep. He had never missed a  morning before, and the sheep were bleating in the fold as if to say,  \"Don't forget us today.\"    The sheep were Jean's playfellows. There was nothing he liked better  than to wander with them in the pleasant pastures, and already they  knew his voice and followed at his call.    \"Let the lad go,\" said his old grandfather. \"When I was no older than  he I watched my father's flock.\"    Jean's father said the same thing, so the mother made haste to get the  little boy ready.    \"Eat your dinner when the shadows lie straight across the grass,\" she  said as she kissed him good-bye.    \"And keep the sheep from the forest paths,\" called his sick father.    \"And watch, for it is when the shepherd is not watching that the wolf  comes to the flock,\" said the old grandfather.    \"Never fear,\" said little Jean. \"The wolf shall not have any of my  white lambs.\"    They were white sheep and black sheep and frolicsome lambs in"]]]
