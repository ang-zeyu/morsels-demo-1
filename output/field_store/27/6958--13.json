This has, from the earliest ages, been the  method of the material world.    In the time of Moses, Pharaoh set himself to prevent the Mosaic Light  being spread abroad.    In the day of Christ, Annas and Caiaphas inflamed the Jewish people  against Him and the learned doctors of Israel joined together to resist  His Power. All sorts of calumnies were circulated against Him. The Scribes  and Pharisees conspired to make the people believe Him to be a liar, an  apostate, and a blasphemer. They spread these slanders throughout the  whole Eastern world against Christ, and caused Him to be condemned to a  shameful death!    In the case of Muhammad also, the learned doctors of His day determined to  extinguish the light of His influence. They tried by the power of the  sword to prevent the spread of His teaching.    In spite of all their efforts the Sun of Truth shone forth from the  horizon. In every case the army of light vanquished the powers of darkness  on the battlefield of the world, and the radiance of the Divine Teaching  illumined the earth. Those who accepted the Teaching and worked for the  Cause of God became luminous stars in the sky of humanity.    Now, in our own day, history repeats itself.    Those who would have men believe that religion is their own private  property once more bring their efforts to bear against the Sun of Truth:  they resist the Command of God; they invent calumnies, not having  arguments against it, neither proofs. They attack with masked faces, not  daring to come forth into the light of day.    Our methods are different, we do not attack, neither calumniate; we do not  wish to dispute with them; we bring forth proofs and arguments; we invite  them to confute our statements. They cannot answer us, but instead, they  write all they can think of against the Divine Messenger, Baha'u'llah.    Do not let your hearts be troubled by these defamatory writings! Obey the  words of Baha'u'llah and answer them not. Rejoice, rather, that even these  falsehoods will result in the spread of the truth. When these slanders  appear inquiries are made, and those who inquire are led into a knowledge  of the Faith.    If a man were to declare, 'There is a lamp in the next room which gives no  light', one hearer might be satisfied with his report, but a wiser man  goes into the room to judge for himself, and behold, when he finds the  light shining brilliantly in the lamp, he knows the truth!    Again, a man proclaims: 'There lies a garden in which there are trees with  broken branches bearing no fruit, and the leaves thereof are faded and  yellow! In that garden, also, there are flowering plants with no blooms,  and rose bushes withered and dying--go not into that garden!' A just man,  hearing this account of the garden, would not be content without seeing  for himself whether it be true or not. He, therefore, enters the garden,  and behold, he finds it well tilled; the branches of the trees are sturdy  and strong, being also loaded with the sweetest of ripe fruits amongst the  luxuriance of beautiful green leaves. The flowering plants are bright with  many-hued blossoms; the rose bushes are covered with fragrant and lovely  roses and all is verdant and well tended. When the glory of the garden is  spread out before the eyes of the just man, he praises God that, through  unworthy calumny, he has been led into a place of such wondrous beauty!    This is the result of the slanderer's work: to be the cause of guiding men  to a discovery of the truth.    We know that all the falsehoods spread about Christ and His apostles and  all the books written against Him, only led the people to inquire into His  doctrine; then, having seen the beauty and inhaled the fragrance, they  walked evermore amidst the roses and the fruits of that celestial garden.    Therefore, I say unto you, spread the Divine Truth with all your might  that men's intelligence may become enlightened; this is the best answer to  those who slander. I do not wish to speak of those people nor to say  anything ill of them--only to tell you that slander is of no importance!    Clouds may veil the sun, but, be they never so dense, his rays will  penetrate! Nothing can prevent the radiance of the sun descending to warm  and vivify the Divine Garden.    Nothing can prevent the fall of the rain from Heaven.    Nothing can prevent the fulfilment of the Word of God!    Therefore when you see books and papers written against the Revelation, be  not distressed, but take comfort in the assurance that the cause will  thereby gain strength.    No one casts stones at a tree without fruit. No one tries to extinguish a  lamp without light!    Regard the former times. Had the calumnies of Pharaoh any effect? He  affirmed that Moses was a murderer, that he had slain a man and deserved  to be executed! He also declared that Moses and Aaron were fomenters of  discord, that they tried to destroy the religion of Egypt and therefore  must be put to death. These words of Pharaoh were vainly spoken. The light  of Moses shone. The radiance of the Law of God has encircled the world!    When the Pharisees said of Christ that He had broken the Sabbath Day, that  He had defied the Law of Moses, that He had threatened to destroy the  Temple and the Holy City of Jerusalem, and that He deserved to be  crucified--We know that all these slanderous attacks had no result in  hindering the spread of the Gospel!    The Sun of Christ shone brilliantly in the sky, and the breath of the Holy  Spirit wafted over the whole earth!    And I say unto you that no calumny is able to prevail against the Light of  God; it can only result in causing it to be more universally recognized.  If a cause were of no significance, who would take the trouble to work  against it!    But always the greater the cause the more do enemies arise in larger and  larger numbers to attempt its overthrow! The brighter the light the darker  the shadow! Our part it is to act in accordance with the teaching of  Baha'u'llah in humility and firm steadfastness.          THERE CAN BE NO TRUE HAPPINESS AND PROGRESS WITHOUT SPIRITUALITY      November 21st    Ferocity and savagery are natural to animals, but men should show forth  the qualities of love and affection. God sent all His Prophets into the  world with one aim, to sow in the hearts of men love and goodwill, and for  this great purpose they were willing to suffer and to die. All the sacred  Books were written to lead and direct man into the ways of love and unity;  and yet, in spite of all this, we have the sad spectacle of war and  bloodshed in our midst.    When we look into the pages of history, past and present, we see the black  earth reddened by human blood. Men kill each other like the savage wolves,  and forget the laws of love and tolerance.    Now this luminous age has come, bringing with it wonderful civilization  and material progress. Men's intellects have widened, their perceptions  grown, but alas, in spite of all this, fresh blood is being spilt day by  day. Look at the present Turco-Italian war; consider for a moment the fate  of these unhappy people! How many have been killed during this sad time?  How many homes are ruined, wives desolate, and children orphans! And what  is to be gained in exchange for all this anguish and heartache? Only a  corner of the earth!    This all shows that material progress alone does not tend to uplift man.  On the contrary, the more he becomes immersed in material progress, the  more does his spirituality become obscured.    In times gone by progress on the material plane was not so rapid, neither  was there bloodshed in such profusion. In ancient warfare there were no  cannons, no guns, no dynamite, no shells, no torpedo boats, no  battleships, no submarines. Now, owing to material civilization, we have  all these inventions, and war goes from bad to worse! Europe itself has  become like one immense arsenal, full of explosives, and may God prevent  its ignition--for, should this happen, the whole world would be involved.    I want to make you understand that material progress and spiritual  progress are two very different things, and that only if material progress  goes hand in hand with spirituality can any real progress come about, and  the Most Great Peace reign in the world. If men followed the Holy Counsels  and the Teachings of the Prophets, if Divine Light shone in all hearts and  men were really religious, we should soon see peace on earth and the  Kingdom of God among men. The laws of God may be likened unto the soul and  material progress unto the body. If the body was not animated by the soul,  it would cease to exist. It is my earnest prayer that spirituality may  ever grow and increase in the world, so that customs may become  enlightened and peace and concord may be established.    War and rapine with their attendant cruelties are an abomination to God,  and bring their own punishment, for the God of love is also a God of  justice and each man must inevitably reap what he sows. Let us try to  understand the commands of the Most High and to order our lives as He  directs. True happiness depends on spiritual good and having the heart  ever open to receive the Divine Bounty.    If the heart turns away from the blessings God offers how can it hope for  happiness? If it does not put its hope and trust in God's Mercy, where can  it find rest? Oh, trust in God! for His Bounty is everlasting, and in His  Blessings, for they are superb. Oh! put your faith in the Almighty, for He  faileth not and His goodness endureth for ever! His Sun giveth Light  continually, and the Clouds of His Mercy are full of the Waters of  Compassion with which He waters the hearts of all who trust in Him. His  refreshing Breeze ever carries healing in its wings to the parched souls  of men! Is it wise to turn away from such a loving Father, Who showers His "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19285"],[0,"The Promulgation of Universal Peace (#14)"],[1,"gthened. Therefore, although we feel sad and disheartened, we must  supplicate God to turn our hearts to the Kingdom and pray for these  departed souls with faith in His infinite mercy so that, although they  have been deprived of this earthly life, they may enjoy a new existence in  the supreme mansions of the Heavenly Father.    Let no one imagine that these words imply that man should not be thorough  and careful in his undertakings. God has endowed man with intelligence so  that he may safeguard and protect himself. Therefore, he must provide and  surround himself with all that scientific skill can produce. He must be  deliberate, thoughtful and thorough in his purposes, build the best ship  and provide the most experienced captain; yet, withal, let him rely upon  God and consider God as the one Keeper. If God protects, nothing can  imperil man's safety; and if it be not His will to safeguard, no amount of  preparation and precaution will avail.          23 April 1912  Talk to Bethel Literary Society  Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church  M Street, NW, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    As I stand here tonight and look upon this assembly, I am reminded  curiously of a beautiful bouquet of violets gathered together in varying  colors, dark and light. This is an evidence and indication that the United  States of America is a just and free government, for I see black and white  seated together in perfect harmony and agreement. Hearts are united. This  just government makes such a meeting possible. You should thank God  continually that you enjoy the security and protection of a government  which furthers your development and rules with impartial equity and  equality toward all, even as a father; for in the human world there is no  greater blessing. This evening I will speak to you upon scientific  subjects.    The virtues of humanity are many, but science is the most noble of them  all. The distinction which man enjoys above and beyond the station of the  animal is due to this paramount virtue. It is a bestowal of God; it is not  material; it is divine. Science is an effulgence of the Sun of Reality,  the power of investigating and discovering the verities of the universe,  the means by which man finds a pathway to God. All the powers and  attributes of man are human and hereditary in origin--outcomes of nature's  processes--except the intellect, which is supernatural. Through  intellectual and intelligent inquiry science is the discoverer of all  things. It unites present and past, reveals the history of bygone nations  and events, and confers upon man today the essence of all human knowledge  and attainment throughout the ages. By intellectual processes and logical  deductions of reason this superpower in man can penetrate the mysteries of  the future and anticipate its happenings.    Science is the first emanation from God toward man. All created beings  embody the potentiality of material perfection, but the power of  intellectual investigation and scientific acquisition is a higher virtue  specialized to man alone. Other beings and organisms are deprived of this  potentiality and attainment. God has created or deposited this love of  reality in man. The development and progress of a nation is according to  the measure and degree of that nation's scientific attainments. Through  this means its greatness is continually increased, and day by day the  welfare and prosperity of its people are assured.    All blessings are divine in origin, but none can be compared with this  power of intellectual investigation and research, which is an eternal gift  producing fruits of unending delight. Man is ever partaking of these  fruits. All other blessings are temporary; this is an everlasting  possession. Even sovereignty has its limitations and overthrow; this is a  kingship and dominion which none may usurp or destroy. Briefly, it is an  eternal blessing and divine bestowal, the supreme gift of God to man.  Therefore, you should put forward your most earnest efforts toward the  acquisition of science and arts. The greater your attainment, the higher  your standard in the divine purpose. The man of science is perceiving and  endowed with vision, whereas he who is ignorant and neglectful of this  development is blind. The investigating mind is attentive, alive; the  callous and indifferent mind is deaf and dead. A scientific man is a true  index and representative of humanity, for through processes of inductive  reasoning and research he is informed of all that appertains to humanity,  its status, conditions and happenings. He studies the human body politic,  understands social problems and weaves the web and texture of  civilization. In fact, science may be likened to a mirror wherein the  infinite forms and images of existing things are revealed and reflected.  It is the very foundation of all individual and national development.  Without this basis of investigation, development is impossible. Therefore,  seek with diligent endeavor the knowledge and attainment of all that lies  within the power of this wonderful bestowal.    We have already stated that science or the attribute of scientific  penetration is supernatural and that all other blessings of God are within  the boundary of nature. What is the proof of this? All created things  except man are captives of nature. The stars and suns swinging through  infinite space, all earthly forms of life and existence--whether mineral,  vegetable or animal--come under the dominion and control of natural law.  Man through scientific knowledge and power rules nature and utilizes her  laws to do his bidding. According to natural limitations he is a creature  of earth, restricted to life upon its surface, but through scientific  utilization of material laws he soars in the sky, sails upon the ocean and  dives beneath it. The products of his invention and discovery, so familiar  to us in daily life, were once mysteries of nature. For instance, man has  brought electricity out of the plane of the invisible into the plane of  the visible, harnessed and imprisoned that mysterious natural agent and  made it the servant of his needs and wishes. Similar instances are many,  but we will not prolong this. Man, as it were, takes the sword out of  nature's hand and with it for his scepter of authority dominates nature  itself. Nature is without the crown of human faculties and attributes. Man  possesses conscious intelligence and reflection; nature does not. This is  an established fundamental among philosophers. Man is endowed with  volition and memory; nature has neither. Man can seek out the mysteries  latent in nature, whereas nature is not conscious of her own hidden  phenomena. Man is progressive; nature is stationary, without the power of  progression or retrogression. Man is endowed with ideal virtues--for  example, intellection, volition, faith, confession and acknowledgment of  God--while nature is devoid of all these. The ideal faculties of man,  including the capacity for scientific acquisition, are beyond nature's  ken. These are powers whereby man is differentiated and distinguished from  all other forms of life. This is the bestowal of divine idealism, the  crown adorning human heads. Notwithstanding the gift of this supernatural  power, it is most amazing that materialists still consider themselves  within the bonds and captivity of nature. The truth is that God has  endowed man with virtues, powers and ideal faculties of which nature is  entirely bereft and by which man is elevated, distinguished and superior.  We must thank God for these bestowals, for these powers He has given us,  for this crown He has placed upon our heads.    How shall we utilize these gifts and expend these bounties? By directing  our efforts toward the unification of the human race. We must use these  powers in establishing the oneness of the world of humanity, appreciate  these virtues by accomplishing the unity of whites and blacks, devote this  divine intelligence to the perfecting of amity and accord among all  branches of the human family so that under the protection and providence  of God the East and West may hold each other's hands and become as lovers.  Then will mankind be as one nation, one race and kind--as waves of one  ocean. Although these waves may differ in form and shape, they are waves  of the same sea. Flowers may be variegated in colors, but they are all  flowers of one garden. Trees differ though they grow in the same orchard.  All are nourished and quickened into life by the bounty of the same rain,  all grow and develop by the heat and light of the one sun, all are  refreshed and exhilarated by the same breeze that they may bring forth  varied fruits. This is according to the creative wisdom. If all trees bore  the same kind of fruit, it would cease to be delicious. In their  never-ending variety man finds enjoyment instead of monotony.    And now as I look into your faces, I am reminded of trees varying in color  and form but all bearing luscious and delectable fruits, fragrant and  delightful to the inner and outer senses. The radiance and spirituality of  this meeting is through the favor of God. Our hearts are uplifted in  thankfulness to Him. Praise be to God! You are living upon the great  continent of the West, enjoying the perfect liberty, security and peace of  this just government. There is no cause for sorrow or unhappiness  anywhere; every means of happiness and enjoyment is about you, for in this  human world there is no greater blessing than liberty. You do not know. I,  who for forty years have been a prisoner, do know. I do know the value and  blessing of liberty. For you have been and are now living in freedom, and  you have no fear of anybody. Is there a greater blessing than this?  Freedom! Liberty! Security! These are the great bestowals of God.  Therefore, praise ye God! I will now pray in your behalf.          24 April 1912 "]]]
